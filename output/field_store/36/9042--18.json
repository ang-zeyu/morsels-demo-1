On they went over the arid plain, which, however, affords nourishment  for some trees, fording rivers, floundering through marshes, and still  meeting some wretched apology for grass, when, on the third day, down  came the snow in a pelting cloud, and the whole desert changed in an  instant from somber gray to white. The real winter was come. Now all  Sakalar's intelligence was required. Almost every obvious sign by  which to find his way had disappeared, and he traversed the plain  wholly guided by distant hills, and by observing the stars at night.  This Sakalar did assiduously, and when he had once started under the  guidance of the twinkling lights of the heavens, rarely was he many  yards out at the next halt. He always chose the side of a hillock  to camp, where there was a tree or two, and half-rotten trunks with  bushes to make a huge fire.    It was nearly dawn on the fifth morning after entering the plain,  and Ivan and Kolina yet slept. But Sakalar slept not. They had  nearly reached the extremity of the horrible desert, but a new danger  occupied the thoughts of the hunter. They were now in the track of  the wild and savage Tchouktchas, and their fire might have betrayed  them. Had Sakalar been alone, he would have slept in the snow without  fire; for he knew the peril of an encounter with the independent  Tchouktchas, who have only recently been nominally brought into  subjection to Russia.    The heavy fall of snow of the two previous days rendered the danger  greater. Sakalar sat gravely upon a fallen tree--a pipe in his mouth,  and his eye fixed on the distant horizon. For some time nothing  remarkable caught his gaze; but at last he saw a number of dark  objects on the snow, galloping directly toward the camp. Sakalar at  once recognized a number of reindeer. It was the Tchouktchas on their  sledges, bounding with lightning speed along the frozen surface!    \"Up!\" cried the hunter. And when his companions were on their feet,  \"Quick with your guns! The enemy are on us! But show a bold front, and  let them feel the weight of lead!\"    Ivan and Kolina quietly took up their post, and awaited the orders  of Sakalar. No time was lost, and fortunately, for the savages were  already near, and were the next minute alighting from their sledges:  hand in hand they advanced along the snow, with their long ice  shoes, to the number of a dozen. A simultaneous discharge of the  heavy-metalled guns of the camp--one of which, that of Sakalar,  wounded the foremost man--checked their career, and they fell back  to hold a conference. It became evident at once that they had no  firearms, which removed almost all idea of danger. Ivan and Kolina  now proceeded to load the horses, and when all was ready, the whole  party mounted, and rode off, followed at a respectful distance by the  Siberian Arabs.    The travelers, however, received no further annoyance from them, and  camped the next night on the borders of the Toukyulane, at the foot of  the mountains of Verkho-Yansk. After the usual repose, they began the  severest part of the journey. Rugged rocks, deep ravines, avalanches,  snow, and ice, all were in their way. Now they rode along the edge  of frightful precipices, on a path so narrow, that one false step was  death; now they forced their way through gulleys full of snow, where  their horses were buried to their girths, and they had to drag them  out by main force. Fortunately the Siberian horse, though small, is  sturdy and indefatigable, living during a three months' journey on  faded grass and half-rotten herbage. That evening they camped on  the loftiest part of the road, where it winds through still elevated  rocks.    The middle of the next day brought them to another plain not much  superior to that they had passed through, but yet less miserable  looking, and with the additional advantage of having yourtes here  and there to shelter the traveler. The cold was now intense; and glad  indeed was Ivan of the comforts of his Siberian dress, which had at  first appeared so heavy. The odd figures which Kolina and Sakalar  presented under it made him smile at the notion which Maria Vorotinska  would have formed of her lover under a garb that doubled his natural  volume. Several halts took place, and caused great delay, from the  slippery state of the ice on the rivers. The unshod horses could not  stand. A fire had to be lit; and when sufficient ashes were procured,  it had to be spread across in a narrow pathway, and the nags led  carefully along on this track--one of the many artifices required to  combat the rigorous character of the climate. And thus, suffering  cold and short commons, and making their way for days through frosty  plains over ice and snow, amid deep ravines and over lofty hills, they  at length reached Nijnei-Kolimsk, though not without being almost  wholly knocked up, especially Kolina, who was totally unused to such  fatigues.    They had now almost reached the borders of the great Frozen Sea. The  village is situated about eighteen degrees farther north than London,  and is nearly as far north as Boothia Felix, the scene of Captain  Ross's four years' sojourn in the ice. It was founded two hundred  years ago by a wandering Cossack; though what could have induced  people to settle in a place which the sun lights, but never warms, is  a mystery; where there is a day that lasts fifty-two English days,  and a night that lasts thirty-eight; where there is no spring and no  autumn, but a faint semblance of summer for three months, and then  winter; where a few dwarf willows and stunted grass form all the  vegetation; and where, at a certain distance below the surface, there  is frost as old as the \"current epoch\" of the geologist. But by way  of compensation, reindeer and elks, brown and black bears, foxes and  squirrels, abound; there are also wolves, and the isatis or polar fox;  there are swans, and geese, and ducks, partridges and snipes, and in  the rivers abundance of fish. And yet, though the population be now  so scanty, and the date of the peopling of Kolimsk is known, there was  once a numerous race in these regions, the ruins of whose forts and  villages are yet found. The population is about 5000, including the  whole district, of whom about 300 are Russians, the descendants of  Siberian exiles. They dwell in houses made of wood thrown up on the  shore, and collected by years of patience, and of moss and clay.  The panes of the windows in winter are of ice, six inches thick; in  summer, of skins. The better class are neatly and even tastefully  dressed, and are clean, which is the very highest praise that can be  given to half-civilized as well as to civilized people.    They are a bold, energetic, and industrious race. Every hour of  weather fit for out-door work is spent in fishing and hunting, and  preparing food for the winter. In the light sledge, or on skates,  with nets and spears, they labored at each of these employments in  its season. Toward the end of the long winter, just as famine and  starvation threaten the whole population, a perfect cloud of swans,  and geese, and ducks, and snipes, pour in; and man and woman, boy and  girl, all rush forth to the hunt. The fish come in next, as the ice  breaks; and presently the time for the reindeer hunt comes round.  Every minute of the summer season is consumed in laying in a stock of  all these aliments for a long and dreary season, when nothing can be  caught. The women collect herbs and roots. As the summer is just about  to end, the herrings appear in shoals, and a new source of subsistence  is opened up, Later still, they fish by opening holes in the  newly-formed ice. Nor is Kolimsk without its trade. The chief traffic  of the region is at the fair of Ostrovnoye, but Nijnei-Kolimsk has  its share. The merchants who come to collect the furs which the  adventurous Tchouktchas have acquired, even on the opposite side of  Behring's Straits, from the North American Indians, halt here, and  sell tea, tobacco, brandy, and other articles.    The long night had set in when Ivan and his companions entered  Kolimsk. Well it was they had come, for the cold was becoming  frightful in its intensity, and the people of the village were  much surprised at the arrival of travelers. But they found ready  accommodation, a Cossack widower giving them half his house.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM DICKENS'S HOUSEHOLD WORDS.]    THE BELGIAN LACE-MAKERS.    The indefatigable, patient, invincible, inquisitive, sometimes  tedious, but almost always amusing German traveler, Herr Kohl, has  recently been pursuing his earnest investigations in Belgium. His book  on the Netherlands has just been issued, and we shall translate, with  abridgments, one of its most instructive and agreeable chapters;--that  relating to Lace-making.    The practical acquaintance of our female readers with that elegant  ornament, lace, is chiefly confined to wearing it, and their  researches into its quality and price. A few minutes' attention to  Mr. Kohl will enlighten them on other subjects connected with what  is to them a most interesting topic, for lace is associated with  recollections of mediaeval history, and with the palmy days of the  Flemish school of painting. More than one of the celebrated masters of  that school have selected, from among his laborious countrywomen, the  lace-makers (or, as they are called in Flanders, _Speldewerksters_),  pleasing subjects for the exercise of his pencil. The plump,  fair-haired Flemish girl, bending earnestly over her lace-work, whilst  her fingers nimbly ply the intricately winding bobbins, figure in many  of those highly esteemed representations of homely life and manners  which have found their way from the Netherlands into all the principal  picture-galleries"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#16)"],[1,"before yesterday evening I called on Frau von Vrintz, a sister of  Meyendorf's wife; the diplomatic folks assemble every evening in her  drawing-room. Countess Thun was there, a very handsome young woman, in  the style of Malvinia; also the Marquis de Tallenay, French  Ambassador, a polite fifty-year-old; Count Szechenyi, a gay young  Magyar, full of pranks, and divers other foreign personages. They  gamble there every evening, the lady of the house, too, and not for  very low stakes; I was scolded for declaring it boresome, and told  them it would be my role to laugh at those who lost. Society probably  does not appeal to you very strongly, my beloved heart, and it seems  to me as though I were harming you by bringing you into it, but how  shall I avoid that? I have one favor to ask of you, but keep it to  yourself, and do not let mother suspect that I have written you one  word about it, otherwise she will worry needlessly over it: occupy  yourself with French as much as you can in the meantime, but let it be  thought that you yourself have discovered that it is useful. Read  French, but, if you love me, do not do so by artificial light, or if  your eyes pain you; in that case you had better ask mother to read to  you, for it is almost harder to understand than to speak. If you know  of any agreeable piece of baggage you can get in a hurry to chatter  French to you, then engage one; I will gladly pay the bill. You will  enter here an atmosphere of French spirit and talk, anyway; so you  cannot avoid familiarizing yourself with it as far as possible. If you  know of no person whom you like and who is available, let it go; and,  at any rate, I beg you sincerely not to consider this advice as a  hardship, or otherwise than if I asked you to buy yourself a green or  a blue dress; it is not a matter of life and death; you are _my_ wife,  and not the diplomats', and they can just as well learn German as you  can learn French. Only if you have leisure, or wish to read anyway,  take a French novel; but if you have no desire to do so, consider this  as not written, for I married you in order to love you in God and  according to the need of my heart, and in order to have in the midst  of the strange world a place for my heart, which all the world's bleak  winds cannot chill, and where I may find the warmth of the home-fire,  to which I eagerly betake myself when it is stormy and cold without;  but not to have a society woman for others, and I shall cherish and  nurse your little fireplace, put wood on it and blow, and protect it  against all that is evil and strange, for, next to God's mercy, there  is nothing which is dearer and more necessary to me than your love,  and the homelike hearth which stands between us everywhere, even in a  strange land, when we are together. Do not be too much depressed and  sad over the change of our life; my heart is not attached, or, at  least, not strongly attached, to earthly honor; I shall easily  dispense with it if it should ever endanger our peace with God or our  contentment. * * * Farewell, my dearly beloved heart. Kiss the  children for me, and give your parents my love.    Your most faithful v.B.      Frankfort, May 16, '51.    _Dear Mother_,--* * * So far as I am at present acquainted with the  _highest_ circles of society, there is only one house which seems to  me to promise company for Johanna--that of the English Ambassador. As  this letter will probably be opened by the Austrian (Frankfort)  post-office authorities, I shall refrain from explaining on this  occasion the reasons therefor. Even those letters which, like my last  ones, I took occasion to send by a courier, are not secure from  indiscretions at _Berlin_; those to me as well as those from me; but  those which go by the regular mail are always opened, except when  there is no time for it, as the gentleman who will read this could  probably testify. But all that, for better, for worse, forms part of  the petty ills of my new position.    In my thoughts I must always ask you and our dad to forgive me for  depriving you of the pleasure and the happiness of your old days,  inasmuch as I transplant to such a distance the bright child-life,  with all its dear cares, and take Johanna away a second time from her  father's house; but I see no other way out of it, which would not be  unnatural, or even wrong, and the strong arm which separated us when  we hoped to be united can also unite us when we least expect it. You  shall at least have the conviction, so far as human purpose can give  it, that I shall wander, together with Johanna, with the strong staff  of the Word of God, trough this dead and wicked activity of the world,  whose nakedness will become more apparent to us in our new position  than before, and that to the end of our joint pilgrimage my hand shall  strive, in faithful love, to smooth Johanna's paths, and to be a warm  covering to her against the breath of the great world.    Your faithful son, v.B.      Frankfort, May 18, '51.    _My Darling_,--Frankfort is terribly tiresome; I am so spoiled by so  much affection and so much business that I am only just beginning to  suspect how ungrateful I always was to some people in Berlin, to say  nothing of you and yours; but even the cooler measure of fellowship  and party affiliation which came to me in Berlin may be called an  intimate relationship compared with intercourse here, which is, in  fact, nothing more than mutual mistrust and espionage, if there only  were anything to spy out or to conceal! The people toil and fret over  nothing but mere trifles, and these diplomats, with their  consequential hair-splitting, already seem to me more ridiculous than  the Member of the Second Chamber in the consciousness of his dignity.  If foreign events do not take place, and those we over-smart Diet  people can neither direct nor prognosticate, I know quite definitely  now what we shall have accomplished in one, two, or five years, and am  willing to effect it in twenty-four hours if the others will but be  truthful and sensible for a single day. I have never doubted that they  all use water for cooking; but such an insipid, silly water-broth, in  which not a single bubble of mutton-suet is visible, surprises me.  Send me Filoehr, the village-mayor, Stephen Lotke, and Herr von  Dombrowsky, of the turnpike-house, as soon as they are washed and  combed, and I shall cut a dash with them in diplomatic circles. I am  making headlong progress in the art of saying nothing by using, many  words; I write reports of many pages, which read nice and smooth as  editorials; and if Manteuffel, after he has read them, can tell what  they contain, he can do more than I. Each of us makes believe that he  thinks the other is full of ideas and plans, if he would but speak  out, and yet we none of us know a jot better than the man in the moon  does what is to become of Germany. No mortal, not even the most  malevolently skeptical Democrat, will believe what a vast amount of  charlatanism and consequential pomposity there is in this diplomacy.  But now I have done enough scolding, and want to tell you that I am  well, and that I was very glad and gave thanks to the Lord that,  according to your last letter, all was well with you, and that I love  you very much, and look at every pretty villa, thinking that perhaps  our _babies_ will be running about in it in summer. Do see that you  get the girls to come along, or if they absolutely refuse, bring  others from there with whom we are already somewhat acquainted. I  don't care to have a Frankfort snip in the room, or with the children;  or we must take a Hessian girl, with short petticoats and ridiculous  head-gear; they are half-way rural and honest. For the present I shall  rent a furnished room for myself in the city; the inn here is too  expensive. Lodgings, 5 guilders per day; two cups of tea, without  anything else, 36 kreutzers (35 are 10 silbergroschen), and, served as  the style is here, it is insulting. Day before yesterday I was at  Mayence; it is a charming region, indeed. The rye is already standing  in full ears, although the weather is infamously cold every night and  morning. The excursions by rail are the best things here. To  Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Odenwald, Hamburg, Soden, Wiesbaden, Bingen,  Ruedesheim, Niederwald, is a leisurely day's journey; one can stay  there for five or six hours and be here again in the evening; hitherto  I have not yet availed myself of it, but shall do so, so that I may  escort you when you are here. Rochow left for Warsaw at nine o'clock  last night; he will arrive there day after tomorrow at noon, and will  most likely be here again a week from today. About politics and  individuals cannot write you much, because most letters are opened,  When once they are familiar with your address on my letters and with  your handwriting on yours, they will probably get over it, because  they have no time to read family letters. Do not be afraid of the  local aristocracy; as to money, Rothschild is the most aristocratic,  but deprive them _all_ of their money and salaries, and it would be  seen how little each one is aristocratic in himself; money doesn't do  it, and otherwise--may the Lord keep me in humility, but here the  temptation is strong to be content with one's self.    Countess Pueckler, sister of the Countess Stolberg, resides at  Weistritz, near Schweidnitz. Now, farewell; I must go out. God's  blessing be with you. Give F. and M. much love. Your most faithful v.  B.      Frankfort, May 27, '51.    _My Darling_,--* * * On Friday there was a ball at Lady Cowley's,  which lasted until five in the morning; they all dance here as if  possessed; the oldest delegates of fifty, with white hair, danced to  the end of the cotillion, in the sweat of their brows.
