The Turks there defended themselves bravely,  reckoning upon assistance from the second line. A column did in fact  advance from the camp of Abukir; but Murat, who had already filed upon  the rear of the village, fell sword in hand upon this column, and drove  it back into Abukir. D'Estaing's infantry and that of Lannes entered the  village at the charge step, driving the Turks out of it, who were pushed  in all directions, and who, obstinately refusing to surrender, had no  retreat but the sea, in which they were drowned.    From four to five thousand had already perished in this manner.  The first line was carried: Bonaparte's object was accomplished. He  immediately followed up his success with desperate fighting to complete  his victory on the moment. The Turks, affrighted, fled on all sides, and  a horrible carnage was made among them. They were pursued at the point  of the bayonet and thrust into the sea. More than twelve thousand  corpses were floating in the bay of Abukir, and two or three thousand  more had perished by the fire or by the sword. The rest, shut up in the  fort, had no rescue but the clemency of the conqueror. Such was that  extraordinary battle in which a hostile army was entirely destroyed.  Thus, either by the expedition to Syria, or by the battle of Abukir,  Egypt was delivered, at least for a time, from the forces of the Porte.    Having arrived in the summer before the inundation, Bonaparte had  employed the first moments in gaining possession of Alexandria and the  capital, which he had secured by the battle of the Pyramids. In the  autumn, after the inundation, he had completed the conquest of the  Delta, and consigned that of Upper Egypt to Desaix. In the winter he had  undertaken the expedition to Syria, and destroyed Djezzar's Turkish army  at Mount Tabor. He had now, in the second summer, just destroyed the  second army of the Porte at Abukir. The time had thus been well spent;  and, while Victory was forsaking in Europe the banners of France, she  adhered to them in Africa and Asia. The tricolour waved triumphant over  the Nile and the Jordan, and over the places which were the cradle of  the Christian religion.    Bonaparte was as yet ignorant of what was passing in France. None of the  despatches from the Directory or from his brothers had reached him,  and he was a prey to the keenest anxiety. With a view to obtaining some  intelligence, he ordered brigs to cruise about, to stop all merchantmen,  and to gain from them information of the occurrences in Europe. He  sent to the Turkish fleet a flag of truce, which, under the pretext of  negotiating an exchange of prisoners, was for the purpose of obtaining  news. Sir Sidney Smith stopped this messenger, treated him exceedingly  well, and, perceiving that Bonaparte was ignorant of the disasters of  France, took a spiteful pleasure in sending him a packet of newspapers.  The messenger returned and delivered the packet to Bonaparte. The latter  spent the whole night in devouring the contents of those papers,  and informing himself of what was passing in his own country. His  determination was immediately taken, and he resolved to embark secretly  for Europe, and on August 22nd, taking with him Berthier, Lannes, Murat,  Andreossy, Marmont, Berthollet, and Monge, and escorted by some of his  guides, he proceeded to a retired spot on the beach, where boats were  awaiting them. They got into them and went on board the frigates, _La  Muiron_ and _La Carrere_. They set sail immediately, that by daylight  they might be out of sight of the English cruisers. Unfortunately  it fell calm; fearful of being surprised, some were for returning to  Alexandria, but Bonaparte resolved to proceed. \"Be quiet,\" said he, \"we  shall pass in safety.\" Like Caesar, he reckoned upon his fortune. Menou,  who alone had been initiated into the secret, made known in Alexandria  the departure of General Bonaparte, and the appointment which he had  made of General Kleber to succeed him. This intelligence caused a  painful surprise throughout the army. The most opprobrious epithets  were applied to this departure. They did not consider that irresistible  impulse of patriotism and ambition, which, on the news of the disasters  of the republic, had urged him to return to France. They perceived only  the forlorn state in which he had left the unfortunate army, which had  felt sufficient confidence in his genius to follow him.    Kleber was not fond of General Bonaparte, and endured his ascendency  with a sort of impatience, and now he was sorry that he had quitted the  banks of the Rhine for the banks of the Nile. The chief command did  not counterbalance the necessity of remaining in Egypt, for he took no  pleasure in commanding.    [Illustration: 124.jpg STATUE OF GENERAL KLEBER AT STRASBURG]    Kleber, however, was the most popular of the generals among the  soldiery. His name was hailed by them with entire confidence, and  somewhat cheered them for the loss of the illustrious commander who had  just left them. He returned to Cairo, assumed the command with a sort of  ostentation, and took possession of the fine Arabian mansion which his  predecessor had occupied in the Ezbekieh Place. But it was not long  before the solicitudes of the chief command, which were insupportable  to him, the new dangers with which the Turks and the English threatened  Egypt, and the grief of exile, which was general, filled his soul with  the most gloomy discouragement.    Kleber, together with Poussielgue, the administrator of the army, at  once prepared and addressed despatches to the Directory, placing the  condition of the troops, the finances, and the number of the enemy in  the most melancholy light. These despatches fell into the hands of the  English, and the duplicate reports found their way into the hands of  Bonaparte himself. Bonaparte had left instructions with Kleber to meet  every possible contingency during his absence, even to the necessity of  an evacuation of Egypt. \"I am going to France,\" said he, \"either as a  private man or as a public man; I will get reinforcement sent to you.  But if by next spring (he was writing in August, 1799) you have received  no supplies, no instructions; if the plague has carried off more than  fifteen hundred men, independently of losses by war; if a considerable  force, which you should be incapable of resisting, presses you hard,  negotiate with the vizier: consent even, if it must be so, to an  evacuation; subject to one condition, that of referring to the French  government; and meanwhile continue to occupy. You will thus have gained  time, and it is impossible that, during the interval, you should not  have received succour.\"    The instructions were very sound; but the case foreseen was far from  being realised at the time when Kleber determined to negotiate for the  evacuation of Egypt. Murad Bey, disheartened, was a fugitive in Upper  Egypt with a few Mamluks. Ibrahim Bey, who, under the government of  the Mamluks, shared the sovereignty with him, was then in Lower Egypt  towards the frontier of Syria.. He had four hundred horse. Djezzar  Pasha was shut up in St. Jean d'Acre, and, so far from preparing a  reinforcement of men for the army of the grand vizier, he viewed, on the  contrary, with high displeasure, the approach of a fresh Turkish army,  now that his pashalik was delivered from the French. As for the grand  vizier, he was not yet across the Taurus. The English had their troops  at Mahon, and were not at this moment aggressive. At Kleber's side was  General Menou, who viewed everything under the most favourable colours,  and believed the French to be invincible in Egypt, and regarded the  expedition as the commencement of a near and momentous revolution in the  commerce of the world. Kleber and Menou were both honest, upright men;  but one wanted to leave Egypt, the other to stay in it; the clearest and  most authentic returns conveyed to them totally contrary significations;  misery and ruin to one, abundance and success to the other.    In September, 1799, Desaix, having completed the conquest and  subjugation of Upper Egypt, had left two movable columns for the pursuit  of Murad Bey, to whom he had offered peace on condition of his becoming  a vassal of France. He then returned to Cairo by the order of Kleber,  who wished to make use of his name in those negotiations into which  he was about to enter. During these proceedings, the army of the grand  vizier, so long announced, was slowly advancing. Sir Sidney Smith, who  convoyed with his squadron the Turkish troops destined to be transported  by sea, had just arrived off Dami-etta with eight thousand janizaries,  and on the first of November, 1799, the landing of the first division  of four thousand janizaries was effected. At the first tidings of this  disembarkation, Kleber had despatched Desaix with a column of three  thousand men; but the latter, uselessly sent to Damietta, had found the  victory won,--the Turkish division having been completely destroyed by  General Verdier,--and the French filled with unbounded confidence.  This brilliant achievement ought to have served to encourage Kleber;  unfortunately, he was swayed at once by his own lack of confidence and  that of the army. In this disposition of mind, Kleber had sent one  of his officers to the vizier (who had entered Syria), to make new  overtures of peace. General Bonaparte, with a view to embroiling the  vizier with the English, had previously entertained the idea of setting  on foot negotiations, which, on his part, were nothing more than a  feint. His overtures had been received with great distrust and pride.  Kleber 's advances met with a favourable reception, through the  influence of Sir Sidney Smith, who was preparing to play a prominent  part in the affairs of Egypt. This officer had largely contributed to  prevent the success of the siege of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#16)"],[1,"the twine used to mark the trail in exploring  new passages. A careful measurement of the twine has shown it to run  nine balls to the mile with a close average of regularity, so it is the  custom to add another mile to the cave record as often as a ninth ball  becomes exhausted.    Wind Cave is twelve miles north of Hot Springs by a good road which  offers somewhat meager attractions to the artist, but is more liberal  towards the geologist, and especially so in fine exposures of the gypsum  bearing Red Beds of the Triassic. Limited patches of it are also exposed  in each of the caves, generally carrying small quantities of selenite,  which is crystallized gypsum, or in other words, crystallized sulphate  of lime. This brilliant red color is so prominent in portions of the  Hills, and attracts so much wondering attention in other well known  regions of the West, that it would seem an unpardonable neglect of  opportunity should we fail to again quote Prof. Todd for an explanation  of the cause of the vivid coloring. Commencing he says: \"Newton remarks  concerning this:[4] 'A large percentage of peroxide of iron in the red  beds, to which they owe their bright red color, bears an interesting  relation to the absence of fossils. The material of which sediments are  formed is derived, by the various processes of denudation, from the  rocks of older land surfaces. Whatever iron they contain is dissolved  from the land and transported in a condition of protoxide and some proto  salt, such as the carbonate, and the process is facilitated by the  presence of carbonic acid in the water. Now iron occurs in these older  rocks as protoxide and peroxide, the former of which is soluble and the  latter insoluble in water. The peroxide, however, by the action of  organic matter, such as is held in solution in boggy waters, may be  deprived of a portion of its oxygen and converted into protoxide and  thus be rendered soluble. If the iron-bearing water is confined first in  a shallow basin and exposed long to the action of the atmosphere the  protoxide of iron absorbs the oxygen and is precipitated as an insoluble  red peroxide of iron. If, however, plant or animal life be present in  sufficient quantities, this oxidation is prevented. In case but little  foreign material, clay or sand, has been brought by the waters, the  deposit will be an iron ore. In case large quantities of foreign  material are deposited from the waters at the same time, there will be  produced, in the absence of life, a brown or red clay or sandstone, and  in its presence a white or light colored formation containing the iron  as a carbonate. We reason therefore from the condition in which the iron  is found in the red beds, that there could have been little or no life,  animal or vegetable, in the water from which it was deposited. The  conclusion is strengthened by the fact of the large quantities of gypsum  which are usually derived from the evaporation of saline waters. The  degree of saline concentration which the precipitation of gypsum  indicates, would be highly inimical to life. The presence of gypsum  helps to account for the absence of life, and the absence of life  accounts for the brilliant color. The three prominent characteristics of  the formation (that is the red beds) are therefore quite in harmony with  each other.'\" (Geol. Blk. Hills, p. 138.)    Continuing the subject, Professor Todd says: \"Accepting this explanation  of the striking red color, the question remains as to how these  circumstances, favorable for its formation, were produced.    \"This red color is quite common in the whole Rocky Mountain region, not  only on the eastern slope of the mountains, but to the various detached  members of the system. We must, therefore, look for some extensive  condition. If we seek some case in the present, parallel to the one  already indicated, we perhaps can find none better than one on the  eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, where, because of dry climate and the  shallow waters, the deposition of gypsum and salt is now going on. In  the gulf known as the Kara Boghaz, which is separated from the Caspian  by a narrow strait, the evaporation is so rapid as to produce an almost  constant flow from the sea into it. This strait and this gulf give the  impression to an unlearned observer that there must be a mysterious  subterranean outlet. The water flows in, carrying with it the salt and  other soluble minerals. It then evaporates, leaving the salt and  minerals behind.\"    This explanation is calculated to afford particular pleasure to the many  visitors to the Garden of the Gods, in Colorado, who seldom receive  satisfactory answers to their questions as to the reasons \"why.\" In that  much visited spot, however, the great mass of the deposit has been  removed by erosion and the curiously shaped remnants are only such  portions as were exceptionally hard and consequently withstood the  action of the submerging waters.    Having made a considerable stop on the way to Wind Cave, we will now  hurry on, but with good horses and a fine day the drive is one of great  pleasure. The road gradually rises to higher ground and soon reaches a  point six hundred feet more elevated than Hot Springs, with a charming  view of hill and valley distances, and the way then continues over the  hill-tops. At one point by the roadside a circle of tent-stones still  marks the spot occupied by Sitting Bull for a week or more after the  Custer massacre, while he camped here and in the security of his  commanding position watched the movements of the government troops who  were in search of him.    Hot Springs and Buffalo Gap are both included in the wide-spread view.  Beside the road and scattered about in all directions are fine specimens  of agates and quartz crystal which seem most beautiful and most abundant  on the hills in the immediate vicinity of the cave, the crystals being  either rose pink, pale green, yellow, white or colorless.    Arriving at the cave, the entrance is not visible, but between the  ravine in which it is located and the road, there is the cave office and  small hotel, on the ravine side of which an outer stairway leads down to  the cave entrance, over which has been built a log cabin.    On account of the precautions taken for the protection of visitors,  accidents are so rare that it might almost be said that none occur.  Every person is required to register before entering the cave and all  returning parties are carefully counted, although they are usually  unaware of the fact. They are always accompanied by two guides and  others are added if the party is large. No one is, on any account,  permitted to wander in advance of the head guide or linger behind the  one in the rear.    Within the cabin the immediate entrance to the cave is securely closed,  and in order that the door may not be forced from its fastenings by the  roaring wind which shakes it threateningly, it opens in, instead of out.  This wind suggested the name Wind Cave, and will probably be utilized,  at no very distant time, to generate electricity for lighting the  cavern.    The wind is strongest at the surface, and a guide goes down first to  place lights in sheltered nooks where the force has begun to diminish,  about fifty feet below the entrance; and here we light our candles  which, if guarded somewhat, are not extinguished unless the current is  unusually severe. The balance of the descent of one hundred and  fifty-five feet from the surface to the first chamber is easily  accomplished.    This would be the least interesting room in the cave if it were not the  Bride's Chamber, on account of having once been the scene of a marriage  ceremony. But no others are in need of assistance of such romantic  nature, as all are curiously and handsomely decorated, with such a  charming variety of deposits, artistically massed, combined or  contrasted, that every step brings fresh pleasure, and monotony is  nowhere.    Passing from this room by a long, narrow passage, in the walls of which  are observed many beautiful little pockets of crystals, attention is  presently called to Lincoln's Fireplace, a perfectly natural specimen of  the old-fashioned design broadly open in the chimney; doubtless just  such an one as Mr. Lincoln's good mother hung the crane in and set the  Dutch oven before. A little beyond and on the opposite side of the  crevice is Prairie-dog town, not a very extensive town, to be sure, but  so true a copy that one unfamiliar with the small animal and his style  of architecture would afterwards easily recognize both. At one time his  dogship was carried away by a too eager collector, but a letter to the  suspected visitor brought him home by the next freight.    The Dutch Clock occupies a position on a shelf near by, and all southern  visitors greet the Alligator as a familiar friend, as all of us joyfully  meet any acquaintance from home.    A long narrow passage, formerly a \"tight crawl,\" but later opened up by  heavy blasting, must be traversed before we come to the Snow Ball Room,  beautiful with round spots of untinted carbonate of lime, as if fresh  soft snow had been thrown by the handful over walls and ceilings, with  the additional ornamentation of calcite crystals. In the crevice beyond  rises the Church Steeple, diminishing regularly, though roughly, in  size, to a height of sixty feet, but not degraded with the little  squirming stairway usually seen in Church spires.    The next room is the Post Office, in which we are for the first time  introduced to the greatest peculiarity and most abundant formation known  to the cave. Being a newly discovered addition to geology it has no  scientific name and therefore is simply called box work, because it  resembles boxes of many shapes and sizes. The formation of the box work  is generally regarded as an unexplained and unexplainable mystery, but a  careful study of various portions of the cave shows "]]]
