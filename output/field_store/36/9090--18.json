His real public service  was now about to begin, and having spent his time in the previous  Legislature mainly as an observer and listener he was determined during  this session to identify himself conspicuously with the \"liberal\"  progressive legislation, dreaming of a fame far different from that he  actually obtained as an anti-slavery leader. As he remarked to his  friend Speed, he hoped to obtain the great distinction of being called  \"the De Witt Clinton of Illinois.\"    It was at a special session of this Legislature that Lincoln first saw  Stephen A. Douglas, his great political antagonist of the future, whom  he describes as \"the _least_ man\" he ever saw. Douglas had come into the  State from Vermont only the previous year, and having studied law for  several months considered himself eminently qualified to be State's  attorney for the district in which he lived. General Linder says of the  two men at this time: \"I here had an opportunity, better than any I had  previously possessed, of measuring the intellectual stature of Abraham  Lincoln. He was then about twenty-seven years old--my own age. Douglas  was four years our junior; consequently he could not have been over  twenty-three years old. Yet he was a very ready and expert debater, even  at that early period of his life. He and Lincoln were very frequently  pitted against each other, being of different politics. They both  commanded marked attention and respect.\"    A notable measure effected by the \"Long Nine\" during this session of the  Legislature was the removal of the State Capital from Vandalia to  Springfield. It was accomplished by dint of shrewd and persistent  management, in which Lincoln was a leading spirit. Mr. Robert L. Wilson,  one of his colleagues, says: \"When our bill to all appearance was dead  beyond resuscitation, and our friends could see no hope, Lincoln never  for a moment despaired. Collecting his colleagues in his room for  consultation, his practical common-sense, his thorough knowledge of  human nature, made him an overmatch for his compeers, and for any man I  have ever known.\"    Lincoln's reputation as an orator was gradually extending beyond the  circle of his friends and constituents. He was gaining notice as a ready  and forcible speaker, with shrewd and sensible ideas which he expressed  with striking originality and independence. He was invited to address  the Young Men's Lyceum at Springfield, January 27, 1837, and read a  carefully prepared paper on \"The Perpetuation of Our Political  Institutions,\" which was afterwards published in the Springfield  \"Weekly Journal.\" The address was crude and strained in style, but the  feeling pervading it was fervent and honest, and its patriotic sentiment  and sound reflection made it effective for the occasion. A few  paragraphs culled from this paper, some of them containing remarkable  prophetic passages, afford a clue to the stage of intellectual  development which Lincoln had reached at the age of twenty-seven, and an  interesting contrast with the terser style of his later years.         In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the       American people, find our account running under date of the       nineteenth century of the Christian era. We find ourselves in the       peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth, as regards       extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate.       We find ourselves under the government of a system of political       institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and       religious liberty than any of which the history of former times       tells us. We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves       the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled not       in the acquisition or establishment of them; they are a legacy       bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave and patriotic, but now       lamented and departed race of ancestors. Theirs was the task (and       nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and, through       themselves, us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills       and valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; 'tis       ours only to transmit these--the former unprofaned by the foot of       an invader, the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by       usurpation--to the latest generation that fate shall permit the       world to know. This task, gratitude to our fathers, justice to       ourselves, duty to posterity, all imperatively require us       faithfully to perform.         How, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the       approach of danger? Shall we expect some transatlantic military       giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the       armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure       of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a       Bonaparte for a commander, could not, by force, take a drink from       the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a       thousand years! At what point, then, is the approach of danger to       be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, _it must spring up       amongst ourselves_. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be       our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation       of free men, we must live through all time, or die by suicide. I       hope I am not over-wary; but, if I am not, there is even now       something of ill-omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard       for law which pervades the country, the growing disposition to       substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober       judgment of the courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the       executive ministers of justice. This disposition is awfully fearful       in any community; and that it now exists in ours, though grating to       our feelings to admit it, it would be a violation of truth and an       insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts of outrages committed       by mobs form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded       the country from New England to Louisiana; they are neither       peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning sun of       the latter. They are not the creature of climate; neither are they       confined to the slaveholding or non-slaveholding States. Alike they       spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves and       the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever       their course may be, it is common to the whole country. Here, then,       is one point at which danger may be expected. The question recurs,       How shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every       American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his       posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution, never to violate       in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to       tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of       'seventy-six' did to the support of the Declaration of       Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and the Laws       let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred       honor; let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample       on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and       his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by       every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap.       Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges. Let it       be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs. Let it be       preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and       enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the       political religion of the nation.    During the years of Lincoln's service in the Illinois Legislature the  Democratic party was strongly dominant throughout the State. The feeling  on the subject of slavery was decidedly in sympathy with the South. A  large percentage of the settlers in the southern and middle portions of  Illinois were from States in which slave labor was maintained; and  although the determination not to permit the institution to obtain a  foothold in the new commonwealth was general, the people were opposed to  any action which should affect its condition where it was already  established. During the sessions of 1836-7 resolutions of an extreme  pro-slavery character were carried through the Legislature by the  Democratic party, aiming to prevent the Abolitionists from obtaining a  foothold in the State. Lincoln could not conscientiously support the  resolutions, nor hold his peace concerning them. He did not shrink from  the issue, but at the hazard of losing his political popularity and the  gratifying prospects that were opening before him he drew up a protest  against the pro-slavery enactment and had it entered upon the Journal of  the House. The state of public opinion in Illinois at that time may be  judged by the fact that of the hundred Representatives in the House  _only one_ had the courage to sign the protest with him. Lincoln's  protest was as follows:         _March 3, 1837_.         The following protest, presented to the House, was read and ordered       to be spread on the journals, to wit:         Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both       branches of the General Assembly at its present session, the       undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same.         They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both       injustice and bad policy; but that the promulgation of abolition"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],[0,"An English Grammar (#16)"],[1," with a sinful sound,       Or had the black art to dispense       A _several_ sin to _every_ sense.--VAUGHAN.

The words of this list are placed here instead of among  pronominal adjectives, for the reason that they are felt to be  primarily adjectives; their pronominal use being evidently a  shortening, by which the words point out but stand for words omitted,  instead of modifying them. Their natural and original use is to be  joined to a noun following or in close connection.    [Sidenote: _The list._]    The demonstrative adjectives are _this_, _that_, (plural _these_,  _those_), _yonder_ (or _yon_), _former_, _latter_; also the pairs  _one_ (or _the one_)--_the other_, _the former_--_the latter_, used to  refer to two things which have been already named in a sentence.    [Sidenote: _Examples._]    The following sentences present some examples:--         The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love, The matron's glance       that would _those_ looks reprove.--GOLDSMITH.         These were thy charms...but all _these_ charms are fled.--_Id._         About _this_ time I met with an odd volume of the       \"Spectator.\"--B. FRANKLIN.         _Yonder_ proud ships are not means of annoyance to you.--D.       WEBSTER.         _Yon_ cloud with _that_ long purple cleft.--WORDSWORTH.         I chose for the students of Kensington two characteristic       examples of early art, of equal skill; but in _the one_ case,       skill which was progressive--in _the other_, skill which was at       pause.--RUSKIN.    Exercise.--Find sentences with five demonstrative adjectives.      [Sidenote: _Ordinal numerals classed under demonstratives._]    147. The class of numerals known as ordinals must be placed here,  as having the same function as demonstrative adjectives. They point  out which thing is meant among a series of things mentioned. The  following are examples:--         The _first_ regular provincial newspapers appear to have been       created in the last decade of the _seventeenth_ century, and by       the middle of the _eighteenth_ century almost every important       provincial town had its local organ.--BANCROFT.    These do not, like the other numerals, tell _how many_ things are  meant. When we speak of the seventeenth century, we imply nothing as  to how many centuries there may be.        PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES.      [Sidenote: _Definition._]    148. As has been said, pronominal adjectives are primarily  pronouns; but, when they _modify_ words instead of referring to them  as antecedents, they are changed to adjectives. They are of two  kinds,--RELATIVE and INTERROGATIVE,--and are used to join sentences or  to ask questions, just as the corresponding pronouns do.      [Sidenote: _Modify names of persons or things._]    149. The RELATIVE ADJECTIVES are _which_ and _what_; for example,--         It matters not _what_ rank he has, _what_ revenues or garnitures.       --CARLYLE.         The silver and laughing Xenil, careless _what_ lord should       possess the banks that bloomed by its everlasting       course.--BULWER.         The taking of _which_ bark. I verily believe, was the ruin of       every mother's son of us.--KINGSLEY.         In _which_ evil strait Mr. Oxenham fought desperately.--_Id._      [Sidenote: _Indefinite relative adjectives._]    150. The INDEFINITE RELATIVE adjectives are _what_, _whatever_,  _whatsoever_, _whichever_, _whichsoever_. Examples of their use are,--         He in his turn tasted some of its flavor, which, make _what_ sour       mouths he would for pretense, proved not altogether displeasing       to him.--LAMB.         _Whatever_ correction of our popular views from insight, nature       will be sure to bear us out in.--EMERSON.         _Whatsoever_ kind of man he is, you at least give him full       authority over your son.--RUSKIN.         Was there, as it rather seemed, a circle of ominous shadow moving       along with his deformity, _whichever_ way he turned       himself?--HAWTHORNE.         New torments I behold, and new tormented       Around me, _whichsoever_ way I move,       And _whichsoever_ way I turn, and gaze.       --LONGFELLOW (FROM DANTE).      151. The INTERROGATIVE ADJECTIVES are _which_ and _what_. They may  be used in direct and indirect questions. As in the pronouns, _which_  is selective among what is known; _what_ inquires about things or  persons not known.    [Sidenote: _In direct questions._]    Sentences with _which_ and _what_ in direct questions:--         _Which_ debt must I pay first, the debt to the rich, or the debt       to the poor?--EMERSON.         But when the Trojan war comes, _which_ side will you take?       --THACKERAY.         But _what_ books in the circulating library circulate?--LOWELL.         _What_ beckoning ghost along the moonlight shade       Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?--POPE.    [Sidenote: _In indirect questions._]    Sentences with _which_ and _what_ in indirect questions:--         His head...looked like a weathercock perched upon his spindle       neck to tell _which_ way the wind blew.--IRVING.         A lady once remarked, he [Coleridge] could never fix _which_ side       of the garden walk would suit him best.--CARLYLE.         He was turned before long into all the universe, where it was       uncertain _what_ game you would catch, or whether any.--_Id._         At _what_ rate these materials would be distributed and       precipitated in regular strata, it is impossible to       determine.--AGASSIZ.      [Sidenote: _Adjective_ what _in exclamations_.]    152. In exclamatory expressions, _what_ (or _what a_) has a force  somewhat like a descriptive adjective. It is neither relative nor  interrogative, but might be called an EXCLAMATORY ADJECTIVE; as,--         Oh, _what a_ revolution! and _what a_ heart must I have, to       contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall!--BURKE.         _What a_ piece of work is man!--SHAKESPEARE.         And yet, alas, the making of it right, _what a_ business for long       time to come!--CARLYLE         Through _what_ hardships it may attain to bear a sweet       fruit!--THOREAU.      Exercise.--Find ten sentences containing pronominal adjectives.        INFLECTIONS OF ADJECTIVES.      153 .Adjectives have two inflections,--number and comparison.      NUMBER.--_This_, _That_.      [Sidenote: _History of_ this--these _and_ that--those.]    154. The only adjectives having a plural form are _this_ and _that_  (plural _these_, _those_).    _This_ is the old demonstrative; _that_ being borrowed from the forms  of the definite article, which was fully inflected in Old English. The  article _that_ was used with neuter nouns.    In Middle English the plural of _this_ was _this_ or _thise_, which  changed its spelling to the modern form _these_.    [Sidenote: Those _borrowed from_ this.]    But _this_ had also another plural, _thas_ (modern _those_). The old  plural of _that_ was _tha_ (Middle English _tho_ or _thow_):  consequently _tho_ (plural of _that_) and _those_ (plural of _this_)  became confused, and it was forgotten that _those_ was really the  plural of _this_; and in Modern English we speak of _these_ as the  plural of _this_, and _those_ as the plural of _that_.      COMPARISON.    155. Comparison is an inflection not possessed by nouns and  pronouns: it belongs to adjectives and adverbs.    [Sidenote: _Meaning of comparison._]    When we place two objects side by side, we notice some differences  between them as to size, weight, color, etc. Thus, it is said that a  cow is _larger_ than a sheep, gold is _heavier_ than iron, a sapphire  is _bluer_ than the sky. All these have certain qualities; and when we  compare the objects, we do so by means of their qualities,--cow and  sheep by the quality of largeness, or size; gold and iron by the  quality of heaviness, or weight, etc.,--but not the same degree, or  amount, of the quality.    The degrees belong to any beings or ideas that may be known or  conceived of as possessing quality; as, \"untamed thought, great,  giant-like, enormous;\" \"the commonest speech;\" \"It is a nobler valor;\"  \"the largest soul.\"    Also words of quantity may be compared: for example, \"more matter,  with less wit;\" \"no fewer than a hundred.\"      [Sidenote: _Words that cannot be compared._]    156. There are some descriptive words whose meaning is such as not  to admit of comparison; for example,--         His company became very agreeable to the brave old professor of       arms, whose _favorite_ pupil he was.--THACKERAY.         A _main_ difference betwixt men is, whether they attend their own       affair or not.--EMERSON         It was his business to administer the law in its _final_ and       closest application to the offender--HAWTHORNE.         Freedom is a _perpetual, organic, universal_ institution, in       harmony with the Constitution of the United States.--SEWARD.    So with the words _sole_, _sufficient_, _infinite_, _immemorial_,  _indefatigable_, _indomitable_, _supreme_, and many others.    It is true that words of comparison are sometimes prefixed to them,  but, strictly considered, they are not compared.      [Sidenote: _Definition._]    157. Comparison means the changes that words undergo to express  degrees in quality, or amounts in quantity.    [Sidenote: _The two forms._]    158. There are two forms for this inflection: the comparative,  expressing a greater degree of quality; and the superlative,  expressing the greatest degree of quality.    These are called degrees of comparison.    These are properly the only degrees, though the simple, uninflected  form is usually called the positive degree.      159. The comparative is formed by adding _-er_, and the superlative  by adding _-est_, to the simple form; as, _red_, _redder_, _reddest_;  _blue_,"]]]
