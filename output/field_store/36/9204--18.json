No, Socrates, that would not become them, said Cebes.    No indeed, he replied; and therefore they who have any care of their  own souls, and do not merely live moulding and fashioning the body, say  farewell to all this; they will not walk in the ways of the blind: and  when philosophy offers them purification and release from evil, they  feel that they ought not to resist her influence, and whither she leads  they turn and follow.    What do you mean, Socrates?    I will tell you, he said. The lovers of knowledge are conscious that  the soul was simply fastened and glued to the body--until philosophy  received her, she could only view real existence through the bars of  a prison, not in and through herself; she was wallowing in the mire of  every sort of ignorance; and by reason of lust had become the principal  accomplice in her own captivity. This was her original state; and  then, as I was saying, and as the lovers of knowledge are well aware,  philosophy, seeing how terrible was her confinement, of which she was  to herself the cause, received and gently comforted her and sought to  release her, pointing out that the eye and the ear and the other senses  are full of deception, and persuading her to retire from them, and  abstain from all but the necessary use of them, and be gathered up and  collected into herself, bidding her trust in herself and her own pure  apprehension of pure existence, and to mistrust whatever comes to her  through other channels and is subject to variation; for such things  are visible and tangible, but what she sees in her own nature is  intelligible and invisible. And the soul of the true philosopher thinks  that she ought not to resist this deliverance, and therefore abstains  from pleasures and desires and pains and fears, as far as she is  able; reflecting that when a man has great joys or sorrows or fears or  desires, he suffers from them, not merely the sort of evil which might  be anticipated--as for example, the loss of his health or property which  he has sacrificed to his lusts--but an evil greater far, which is the  greatest and worst of all evils, and one of which he never thinks.    What is it, Socrates? said Cebes.    The evil is that when the feeling of pleasure or pain is most intense,  every soul of man imagines the objects of this intense feeling to be  then plainest and truest: but this is not so, they are really the things  of sight.    Very true.    And is not this the state in which the soul is most enthralled by the  body?    How so?    Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails  and rivets the soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and  believes that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from  agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to  have the same habits and haunts, and is not likely ever to be pure at  her departure to the world below, but is always infected by the body;  and so she sinks into another body and there germinates and grows,  and has therefore no part in the communion of the divine and pure and  simple.    Most true, Socrates, answered Cebes.    And this, Cebes, is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge are  temperate and brave; and not for the reason which the world gives.    Certainly not.    Certainly not! The soul of a philosopher will reason in quite another  way; she will not ask philosophy to release her in order that when  released she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of pleasures  and pains, doing a work only to be undone again, weaving instead of  unweaving her Penelope's web. But she will calm passion, and follow  reason, and dwell in the contemplation of her, beholding the true  and divine (which is not matter of opinion), and thence deriving  nourishment. Thus she seeks to live while she lives, and after death she  hopes to go to her own kindred and to that which is like her, and to be  freed from human ills. Never fear, Simmias and Cebes, that a soul which  has been thus nurtured and has had these pursuits, will at her departure  from the body be scattered and blown away by the winds and be nowhere  and nothing.    When Socrates had done speaking, for a considerable time there was  silence; he himself appeared to be meditating, as most of us were, on  what had been said; only Cebes and Simmias spoke a few words to one  another. And Socrates observing them asked what they thought of the  argument, and whether there was anything wanting? For, said he, there  are many points still open to suspicion and attack, if any one were  disposed to sift the matter thoroughly. Should you be considering  some other matter I say no more, but if you are still in doubt do not  hesitate to say exactly what you think, and let us have anything better  which you can suggest; and if you think that I can be of any use, allow  me to help you.    Simmias said: I must confess, Socrates, that doubts did arise in our  minds, and each of us was urging and inciting the other to put the  question which we wanted to have answered and which neither of us liked  to ask, fearing that our importunity might be troublesome under present  at such a time.    Socrates replied with a smile: O Simmias, what are you saying? I am  not very likely to persuade other men that I do not regard my present  situation as a misfortune, if I cannot even persuade you that I am no  worse off now than at any other time in my life. Will you not allow that  I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans? For they,  when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their life long,  do then sing more lustily than ever, rejoicing in the thought that  they are about to go away to the god whose ministers they are. But men,  because they are themselves afraid of death, slanderously affirm of the  swans that they sing a lament at the last, not considering that no bird  sings when cold, or hungry, or in pain, not even the nightingale, nor  the swallow, nor yet the hoopoe; which are said indeed to tune a lay of  sorrow, although I do not believe this to be true of them any more than  of the swans. But because they are sacred to Apollo, they have the gift  of prophecy, and anticipate the good things of another world, wherefore  they sing and rejoice in that day more than they ever did before. And I  too, believing myself to be the consecrated servant of the same God, and  the fellow-servant of the swans, and thinking that I have received from  my master gifts of prophecy which are not inferior to theirs, would not  go out of life less merrily than the swans. Never mind then, if this be  your only objection, but speak and ask anything which you like, while  the eleven magistrates of Athens allow.    Very good, Socrates, said Simmias; then I will tell you my difficulty,  and Cebes will tell you his. I feel myself, (and I daresay that you have  the same feeling), how hard or rather impossible is the attainment of  any certainty about questions such as these in the present life. And yet  I should deem him a coward who did not prove what is said about them to  the uttermost, or whose heart failed him before he had examined them  on every side. For he should persevere until he has achieved one of two  things: either he should discover, or be taught the truth about them;  or, if this be impossible, I would have him take the best and most  irrefragable of human theories, and let this be the raft upon which he  sails through life--not without risk, as I admit, if he cannot find some  word of God which will more surely and safely carry him. And now, as  you bid me, I will venture to question you, and then I shall not have to  reproach myself hereafter with not having said at the time what I think.  For when I consider the matter, either alone or with Cebes, the argument  does certainly appear to me, Socrates, to be not sufficient.    Socrates answered: I dare say, my friend, that you may be right, but I  should like to know in what respect the argument is insufficient.    In this respect, replied Simmias:--Suppose a person to use the same  argument about harmony and the lyre--might he not say that harmony is  a thing invisible, incorporeal, perfect, divine, existing in the lyre  which is harmonized, but that the lyre and the strings are matter and  material, composite, earthy, and akin to mortality? And when some one  breaks the lyre, or cuts and rends the strings, then he who takes this  view would argue as you do, and on the same analogy, that the harmony  survives and has not perished--you cannot imagine, he would say, that  the lyre without the strings, and the broken strings themselves which  are mortal remain, and yet that the harmony, which is of heavenly and  immortal nature and kindred, has perished--perished before the mortal.  The harmony must still be somewhere, and the wood and strings will decay  before anything can happen to that. The thought, Socrates, must have  occurred to your own mind that such is our conception of the soul;  and that when the body is in a manner strung and held together by the  elements of hot and cold, wet and dry, then the soul is the harmony or  due proportionate admixture of them. But if so, whenever the strings of  the body are unduly loosened or overstrained through disease or other  injury, then the soul, though most divine, like other harmonies of music  or of works of art, of course perishes at once, although the material  remains of the body may last for a considerable time, until they are  either decayed or burnt. And if any one maintains that the soul, being  the harmony of the elements of the body, is first to perish in that  which is called death, how shall we answer him?    Socrates looked fixedly at us as his manner was, and said with a smile:  Simmias has reason on his side; and why does not some one of you who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#16)"],[1,"in  the Forest of Argonne, near Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood, St. Mihiel  district, Champagne sector, at Metz and in the Vosges mountains.    In the 92nd division was the 325th Field Signal battalion, the only  Negro signal unit in the American army. The division also contained the  349th, 350th and 351st Artillery regiments, each containing a machine  gun battalion; the 317th Trench Mortar battery; the balance being made  up of Negro engineers, hospital units, etc., and the 365th, 366th, 367th  and 368th Infantry regiments.    Enlisted, drafted and assigned to active service, upwards of 400,000  Negroes participated in the war. The number serving abroad amounted to  about 200,000. They were inducted into the cavalry, infantry, field and  coast artillery, radio (wireless telegraphy, etc.), medical corps,  ambulance and hospital corps, sanitary and ammunition trains, stevedore  regiments, labor battalions, depot brigades and engineers. They also  served as regimental clerks, surveyors and draftsmen.    Sixty served as chaplains and over 350 as Y.M.C.A. secretaries, there  being a special and highly efficient Negro branch of the Y.M.C.A.  Numerous others were attached to the War Camp Community Service in  cities adjacent to the army camps.    Negro nurses were authorized by the war department for service in base  hospitals at six army camps--Funston, Sherman, Grant, Dix, Taylor and  Dodge. Race women also served as canteen workers in France and in charge  of hostess houses in this country.    One Negro, Ralph W. Tyler, served as an accredited war correspondent,  attached to the staff of General Pershing, Dr. R.R. Moton, who  succeeded the late Booker T. Washington as head of the Tuskegee  Institute, was sent on a special mission to France by President Wilson  and Secretary Baker.    A race woman, Mrs. Alice Dunbar Nelson of Wilmington, Delaware, was  named as a field worker to mobilize the Negro women of the country for  war work. Her activities were conducted in connection with the Women's  Committee of the Council of National Defense.    The most conspicuous honor paid to a Negro by the administration and the  war department, was in the appointment, October 1, 1917, of Emmett J.  Scott as special assistant to the Secretary of War. This was done that  the administration might not be accused of failing to grant full  protection to the Negroes, and that a thorough examination might be made  into all matters affecting their relation to the war and its many  agencies.    Having been for 18 years confidential secretary to Booker T. Washington,  and being at the time of his appointment secretary of the Tuskegee  Normal and Industrial Institute for Negroes, Mr. Scott was peculiarly  fitted to render necessary advice to the war department with respect to  the Negroes of the various states, to look after all matters affecting  the interests of Negro selectives and enlisted men, and to inquire into  the treatment accorded them by the various officials connected with the  war department. In the position occupied by him, he was thus enabled to  obtain a proper perspective both of the attitude of selective service  officials to the Negro, and of the Negro to the war, especially to the  draft. In a memorandum on the subject addressed to the Provost Marshall  General, December 12, 1918, he wrote:    \"The attitude of the Negro was one of complete acceptance of the draft,  in fact of an eagerness to accept its terms. There was a deep  resentment in many quarters that he was not permitted to volunteer, as  white men by the thousands were permitted to do in connection with  National Guard units and other branches of military service which were  closed to colored men. One of the brightest chapters in the whole  history of the war is the Negro's eager acceptance of the draft and his  splendid willingness to fight. His only resentment was due to the  limited extent to which he was allowed to join and participate in  combatant or 'fighting' units. The number of colored draftees accepted  for military duty, and the comparatively small number of them claiming  exemptions, as compared with the total number of white and colored men  called and drafted, presents an interesting study and reflects much  credit upon this racial group.\"    Over 1,200 Negro officers, many of them college graduates, were  commissioned during the war. The only training camp exclusively for  Negro officers was at Fort Des Moines, Iowa. This camp ran from June 15,  1917, to October 15, 1917. A total of 638 officers was graduated and  commissioned from the camp. Negro Regulars and Negro National Army men  who had passed the tests for admission to officers training camps were  sent mainly to the training schools for machine gun officers at Camp  Hancock, Augusta, Georgia; the infantry officers training school at Camp  Pike, Little Rock, Arkansas, and the artillery officers training school  at Camp Taylor, Louisville, Kentucky. They were trained along with the  white officers. The graduates from these camps along with a few National  Guardsmen who had taken the officers' examinations, and others trained  in France, made up the balance of the 1,200 commissioned.    In connection with the artillery training an interesting fact developed.  It had been charged that Negroes could not develop into artilleryman. A  strong prejudice against inducting them into that branch of the service  had always existed in the army. It was especially affirmed that the  Negro did not possess the mathematical ability necessary to qualify as  an expert artillery officer. Nevertheless, out of a number of Negro  aspirants, very small in comparison with the white men in training for  officers' commissions at the camp, five of the Negroes stood alongside  their white brothers at the head of the class. The remainder were  sprinkled down the line about in the same proportion and occupying the  same relative positions as the whites. The prejudice against the Negro  as an artilleryman was further and effectually dispelled in the record  made by the 349th, 350th and 351st artillery regiments and their machine  gun battalions in the 92nd division.    With the exception of the training camp for officers at Des Moines,  Iowa, no important attempt was made to establish separate Negro training  camps. In the draft quotas from each state were whites and blacks and  all with few exceptions, were sent to the most convenient camp.  Arrangements existed, however, at the different camps for the separate  housing and training of the Negro troops. This was in line with the  military policy of the Government, as well as in deference to the  judgment of both white and black officers. It undoubtedly was necessary  to separate the two races. Furthermore, as the military policy called  for regiments, battalions and, divisions made up entirely of Negroes, it  was proper to commence the organization at the training camps. Companies  formed in this manner thus became homogeneous, accustomed to one another  individually and to their officers.    The situation was different from the Spanish-American war, where Negro  units, at least in one case, served in white regiments. Racial strife  and rivalry were eliminated. The only rivalry that existed was the  good-natured and healthy one of emulation between members of the same  race. On the field of battle there was rivalry and emulation between the  whites and blacks, but it was the rivalry of organizations and not of  races. The whole was tempered by that splendid admiration and  fellow-feeling which comes to men of all races when engaged as partners  in danger or near death; in the defense and promotion of a great cause;  the eternal verities of Justice and Humanity.          CHAPTER VIII    RECRUDESCENCE OF SOUTH'S INTOLERANCE      CONFRONTED BY RACIAL PEEJUDICE--- SPLENDID ATTITUDE OF NEGRO SHAMED  IT--KEPT OUT OF NAVY--ONLY ONE PER CENT OF NAVY PERSONNEL  NEGROES--MODIFIED MARINES CONTEMPLATED--FEW HAVE PETTY OFFICERS'  GRADES--SEPARATE SHIPS PROPOSED--NEGRO EFFICIENCY IN NAVY--MATERIAL FOR  \"BLACK SHIPS\"--NAVY OPENS DOOR TO NEGRO MECHANICS.      Old feelings of race prejudice and intolerance, appearing mainly in the  South, confronted the Negro at the beginning of the war. The splendid  attitude of the Negro shamed and overcame this feeling in other sections  of the country, and was beginning to have its effect even in the South.  It is true that men of the race were not accepted for voluntary  enlistment in numbers of consequence in any section, but had the  voluntary system continued in vogue, the willingness and desire of the  race to serve, coupled with the very necessities of the case, would have  altered the condition.    No new Negro volunteer units were authorized, but the demand for men  would soon have made it imperative. It would have been combatted by a  certain element in the South, but the friends of the few volunteer units  which did exist in that section were firm in their championship and were  winning adherents to their view that the number should be increased. The  selective draft with its firm dictum that all men within certain ages  should be called and the fit ones chosen, put an end to all contention.  The act was not passed without bitter opposition which developed in its  greatest intensity among the Southern senators and representatives;  feelings that were inspired entirely by opposition to the Negro.    It would have been a bad thing for the country and would have prolonged  the war, and possibly might have lost it, if the selective draft had  been delayed. But it would have been interesting to see how far the  country, especially the South, would have progressed in the matter of  raising a volunteer army without accepting Negroes. Undoubtedly they  soon would have been glad to recruit them, even in the South.    Unfortunately for the Negro, the draft was not able to prevent their  being kept out of the Navy. It is a very desirable branch "]]]
