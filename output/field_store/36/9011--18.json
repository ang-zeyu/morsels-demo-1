Fain would priests persuade  That now she must approve by deed    The faith she kept. \"What dead?\" she asked.  \"Your old sire leave, nor deem it sin,    And come with us.\" Still more they tasked  The sad one: \"If heaven you'd win--    Far from the burning pit withdraw,  Then must you learn to hate your kin,    Yea, side against them--such the law,  For Moor and Christian are at war\"  \"Then will I never quit my sire,  But here with him through every trial go,  Nor leave him though in flames below--  God help me in his fire!\"  So in the South; vain every plea  'Gainst Nature's strong fidelity;    True to the home and to the heart,  Throngs cast their lot with kith and kin,    Foreboding, cleaved to the natural part--  Was this the unforgivable sin?  These noble spirits are yet yours to win.  Shall the great North go Sylla's way?  Proscribe? prolong the evil day?  Confirm the curse? infix the hate?  In Unions name forever alienate?    \"From reason who can urge the plea--  Freemen conquerors of the free?  When blood returns to the shrunken vein,  Shall the wound of the Nation bleed again?  Well may the wars wan thought supply,  And kill the kindling of the hopeful eye,  Unless you do what even kings have done  In leniency--unless you shun  To copy Europe in her worst estate--  Avoid the tyranny you reprobate.\"    He ceased. His earnestness unforeseen  Moved, but not swayed their former mien;    And they dismissed him. Forth he went  Through vaulted walks in lengthened line  Like porches erst upon the Palatine:    Historic reveries their lesson lent,    The Past her shadow through the Future sent.    But no. Brave though the Soldier, grave his plea--    Catching the light in the future's skies,  Instinct disowns each darkening prophecy:    Faith in America never dies;  Heaven shall the end ordained fulfill,  We march with Providence cheery still.          A Meditation:    Attributed to a northerner after attending the last of two funerals  from the same homestead--those of a national and a confederate  officer (brothers), his kinsmen, who had died from the effects of  wounds received in the closing battles.        A Meditation.      How often in the years that close,    When truce had stilled the sieging gun,  The soldiers, mounting on their works,    With mutual curious glance have run  From face to face along the fronting show,  And kinsman spied, or friend--even in a foe.    What thoughts conflicting then were shared.    While sacred tenderness perforce  Welled from the heart and wet the eye;    And something of a strange remorse  Rebelled against the sanctioned sin of blood,  And Christian wars of natural brotherhood.    Then stirred the god within the breast--    The witness that is man's at birth;  A deep misgiving undermined    Each plea and subterfuge of earth;  The felt in that rapt pause, with warning rife,  Horror and anguish for the civil strife.    Of North or South they recked not then,    Warm passion cursed the cause of war:  Can Africa pay back this blood    Spilt on Potomac's shore?  Yet doubts, as pangs, were vain the strife to stay,  And hands that fain had clasped again could slay.    How frequent in the camp was seen    The herald from the hostile one,  A guest and frank companion there    When the proud formal talk was done;  The pipe of peace was smoked even 'mid the war,  And fields in Mexico again fought o'er.    In Western battle long they lay    So near opposed in trench or pit,  That foeman unto foeman called    As men who screened in tavern sit:  \"You bravely fight\" each to the other said--  \"Toss us a biscuit!\" o'er the wall it sped.    And pale on those same slopes, a boy--    A stormer, bled in noon-day glare;  No aid the Blue-coats then could bring,    He cried to them who nearest were,  And out there came 'mid howling shot and shell  A daring foe who him befriended well.    Mark the great Captains on both sides,    The soldiers with the broad renown--  They all were messmates on the Hudson's marge,    Beneath one roof they laid them down;  And free from hate in many an after pass,  Strove as in school-boy rivalry of the class.    A darker side there is; but doubt    In Nature's charity hovers there:  If men for new agreement yearn,    Then old upbraiding best forbear:  \"_The South's the sinner!_\" Well, so let it be;  But shall the North sin worse, and stand the Pharisee?    O, now that brave men yield the sword,    Mine be the manful soldier-view;  By how much more they boldly warred,    By so much more is mercy due:  When Vickburg fell, and the moody files marched out,  Silent the victors stood, scorning to raise a shout.          Footnotes.      1. The gloomy lull of the early part of the winter of 1860-1, seeming  big with final disaster to our institutions, affected some minds that  believed them to constitute one of the great hopes of mankind, much as  the eclipse which came over the promise of the first French Revolution  affected kindred natures, throwing them for the time into doubt and  misgivings universal.    2. \"The terrible Stone Fleet on a mission as pitiless as the granite  that freights it, sailed this morning from Port Royal, and before two  days are past will have made Charleston an inland city. The ships are  all old whalers, and cost the government from $2500 to $5000 each. Some  of them were once famous ships.--\" (From Newspaper Correspondences of  the day.)    Sixteen vessels were accordingly sunk on the bar at the river entrance.  Their names were as follows:    Amazon,  America,  American,  Archer,  Courier,  Fortune,  Herald,  Kensington,  Leonidas,  Maria Theresa,  Potomac,  Rebecca Simms,  L.C. Richmond,  Robin Hood,  Tenedos,  William Lee.    All accounts seem to agree that the object proposed was not  accomplished. The channel is even said to have become ultimately  benefited by the means employed to obstruct it.    3. The _Temeraire_, that storied ship of the old English fleet, and the  subject of the well-known painting by Turner, commends itself to the  mind seeking for some one craft to stand for the poetic ideal of those  great historic wooden warships, whose gradual displacement is lamented  by none more than by regularly educated navy officers, and of all  nations.    4. Some of the cannon of old times, especially the brass ones, unlike  the more effective ordnance of the present day, were cast in shapes  which Cellini might have designed, were gracefully enchased, generally  with the arms of the country. A few of them--field-pieces--captured in  our earlier wars, are preserved in arsenals and navy-yards.    5. Whatever just military criticism, favorable or otherwise, has at any  time been made upon General McClellan's campaigns, will stand. But if,  during the excitement of the conflict, aught was spread abroad tending  the unmerited disparagement of the man, it must necessarily die out,  though not perhaps without leaving some traces, which may or may not  prove enduring. Some there are whose votes aided in the re-election of  Abraham Lincoln, who yet believed, and retain the belief, that General  McClellan, to say the least, always proved himself a patriotic and  honorable soldier. The feeling which surviving comrades entertain for  their late commnder is one which, from its passion, is susceptible of  versified representation, and such it receives.    6. At Antietam Stonewall Jackson led one wing of Lee's army, consequenty  sharing that day in whatever may be deemed to have been the fortunes of  his superior.    7. Admiral Porter is son of the late Commodore Porter, commander of the  Frigate Essex on that Pacific cruise which ended in the desparate fight  off Valparaiso with the English frigates Cherub and Phoebe, in the year  1814.    8. Among numerous head-stones or monuments on Cemetery Hill, marred or  destroyed by the enemy's concentrated fire, was one, somewhat  conspicuous, of a Federal officer killed before Richmond in 1862.    On the 4th of July 1865, the Gettysburg National Cemetery, on the same  height with the original burial-ground, was consecrated, and the  corner-stone laid of a commemorative pile.    9. \"I dare not write the horrible and inconceivable atrocities  committed,\" says Froissart, in alluding to the remarkable sedition in  France during his time. The like may be hinted of some proceedings of  the draft-rioters.    10. Although the month was November, the day was in character an October  one--cool, clear, bright, intoxicatingly invigorating; one of those days  peculiar to the ripest hours of our American Autumn. This weather must  have had much to do with the spontaneous enthusiasm which seized the  troops--and enthusiasm aided, doubtless, by glad thoughts of the victory  of Look-out Mountain won the day previous, and also by the elation  attending the capture, after a fierce struggle, of the long ranges of  rifle-pits at the mountain's base, where orders for the time should have  stopped the advance. But there and then it was that the army took the  bit between its teeth, and ran away with the generals to the victory  commemorated. General Grant, at Culpepper, a few weeks prior to crossing  the Rapidan for the Wilderness, expressed to a visitor his impression of  the impulse and the spectacle: Said he: \"I never saw any thing like it:\"  language which seems curiously undertoned, considering its application;  but from the taciturn Commander it was equivalent to a superlative or  hyperbole from the talkative.    The height of the Ridge, according to the account at hand, varies along  its length from six to seven hundred feet above the plain; it slopes at  an angle of about forty-five degrees.    11. The great Parrott gun, planted in the marshes of James Island, and  employed in the prolonged, though at times intermitted bombardment of  Charleston, was known among our soldiers as the Swamp Angel.    St. Michael's, characterized by its venerable tower, was the historic  and aristrocratic "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#16)"],[1,"y. \"When I  came out here alone twelve years ago the Indians were peaceable. If  the pioneers had paid for land, as I paid Cornplanter, there would  never have been a border war. But no; the settlers must grasp every  acre they could. Then the Indians rebelled; then the Girtys and  their allies spread discontent, and now the border is a bloody  warpath.\"    \"Have the Jesuit missionaries accomplished anything with these war  tribes?\" inquired Jim.    \"No; their work has been chiefly among the Indians near Detroit and  northward. The Hurons, Delawares, Shawnees and other western tribes  have been demoralized by the French traders' rum, and incited to  fierce hatred by Girty and his renegades. Your work at Gnaddenhutten  must be among these hostile tribes, and it is surely a hazardous  undertaking.\"    \"My life is God's,\" murmured the old minister. No fear could assail  his steadfast faith.    \"Jim, it strikes me you'd be more likely to impress these Indians  Colonel Zane spoke of if you'd get a suit like mine and wear a knife  and tomahawk,\" interposed Joe, cheerfully. \"Then, if you couldn't  convert, you could scalp them.\"    \"Well, well, let us hope for the best,\" said Colonel Zane, when the  laughter had subsided. \"We'll go over to dinner now. Come, all of  you. Jonathan, bring Wetzel. Betty, make him come, if you can.\"    As the party slowly wended its way toward the colonel's cabin Jim  and Nell found themselves side by side. They had not exchanged a  word since the evening previous, when Jim had kissed her. Unable to  look at each other now, and finding speech difficult, they walked in  embarrassed silence.    \"Doesn't Joe look splendid in his hunting suit?\" asked Jim,  presently.    \"I hadn't noticed. Yes; he looks well,\" replied Nell, carelessly.  She was too indifferent to be natural.    \"Are you angry with him?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    Jim was always simple and frank in his relations with women. He had  none of his brother's fluency of speech, with neither confidence,  boldness nor understanding of the intricate mazes of a woman's  moods.    \"But--you are angry with--me?\" he whispered.    Nell flushed to her temples, yet she did not raise her eyes nor  reply.    \"It was a terrible thing for me to do,\" went on Jim, hesitatingly.  \"I don't know why I took advantage--of--of your mistaking me for  Joe. If you only hadn't held up your mouth. No--I don't mean  that--of course you didn't. But--well, I couldn't help it. I'm  guilty. I have thought of little else. Some wonderful feeling has  possessed me ever since--since---\"    \"What has Joe been saying about me?\" demanded Nell, her eyes burning  like opals.    \"Why, hardly anything,\" answered Jim, haltingly. \"I took him to task  about--about what I considered might be wrong to you. Joe has never  been very careful of young ladies' feelings, and I thought--well, it  was none of my business. He said he honestly cared for you, that you  had taught him how unworthy he was of a good woman. But he's wrong  there. Joe is wild and reckless, yet his heart is a well of gold. He  is a diamond in the rough. Just now he is possessed by wild notions  of hunting Indians and roaming through the forests; but he'll come  round all right. I wish I could tell you how much he has done for  me, how much I love him, how I know him! He can be made worthy of  any woman. He will outgrow this fiery, daring spirit, and  then--won't you help him?\"    \"I will, if he will let me,\" softly whispered Nell, irresistibly  drawn by the strong, earnest love thrilling in his voice.        Chapter X.    Once more out under the blue-black vault of heaven, with its myriads  of twinkling stars, the voyagers resumed their westward journey.  Whispered farewells of new but sincere friends lingered in their  ears. Now the great looming bulk of the fort above them faded into  the obscure darkness, leaving a feeling as if a protector had  gone--perhaps forever. Admonished to absolute silence by the stern  guides, who seemed indeed to have embarked upon a dark and deadly  mission, the voyagers lay back in the canoes and thought and  listened. The water eddied with soft gurgles in the wake of the  racing canoes; but that musical sound was all they heard. The  paddles might have been shadows, for all the splash they made; they  cut the water swiftly and noiselessly. Onward the frail barks glided  into black space, side by side, close under the overhanging willows.  Long moments passed into long hours, as the guides paddled  tirelessly as if their sinews were cords of steel.    With gray dawn came the careful landing of the canoes, a cold  breakfast eaten under cover of a willow thicket, and the beginning  of a long day while they were lying hidden from the keen eyes of  Indian scouts, waiting for the friendly mantle of night.    The hours dragged until once more the canoes were launched, this  time not on the broad Ohio, but on a stream that mirrored no shining  stars as it flowed still and somber under the dense foliage.    The voyagers spoke not, nor whispered, nor scarcely moved, so  menacing had become the slow, listening caution of Wetzel and Zane.  Snapping of twigs somewhere in the inscrutable darkness delayed them  for long moments. Any movement the air might resound with the  horrible Indian war-whoop. Every second was heavy with fear. How  marvelous that these scouts, penetrating the wilderness of gloom,  glided on surely, silently, safely! Instinct, or the eyes of the  lynx, guide their course. But another dark night wore on to the  tardy dawn, and each of its fearful hours numbered miles past and  gone.    The sun was rising in ruddy glory when Wetzel ran his canoe into the  bank just ahead of a sharp bend in the stream.    \"Do we get out here?\" asked Jim, seeing Jonathan turn his canoe  toward Wetzel's.    \"The village lies yonder, around the bend,\" answered the guide.  \"Wetzel cannot go there, so I'll take you all in my canoe.\"    \"There's no room; I'll wait,\" replied Joe, quietly. Jim noted his  look--a strange, steady glance it was--and then saw him fix his eyes  upon Nell, watching her until the canoe passed around the  green-bordered bend in the stream.    Unmistakable signs of an Indian town were now evident. Dozens of  graceful birchen canoes lay upon the well-cleared banks; a log  bridge spanned the stream; above the slight ridge of rising ground  could be seen the poles of Indian teepees.    As the canoe grated upon the sandy beach a little Indian boy, who  was playing in the shallow water, raised his head and smiled.    \"That's an Indian boy,\" whispered Kate.    \"The dear little fellow!\" exclaimed Nell.    The boy came running up to them, when they were landed, with  pleasure and confidence shining in his dusky eyes. Save for tiny  buckskin breeches, he was naked, and his shiny skin gleamed  gold-bronze in the sunlight. He was a singularly handsome child.    \"Me--Benny,\" he lisped in English, holding up his little hand to  Nell.    The action was as loving and trusting as any that could have been  manifested by a white child. Jonathan Zane stared with a curious  light in his dark eyes; Mr. Wells and Jim looked as though they  doubted the evidence of their own sight. Here, even in an Indian  boy, was incontestable proof that the savage nature could be tamed  and civilized.    With a tender exclamation Nell bent over the child and kissed him.    Jonathan Zane swung his canoe up-stream for the purpose of bringing  Joe. The trim little bark slipped out of sight round the bend.  Presently its gray, curved nose peeped from behind the willows; then  the canoe swept into view again. There was only one person in it,  and that the guide.    \"Where is my brother?\" asked Jim, in amazement.    \"Gone,\" answered Zane, quietly.    \"Gone! What do you mean? Gone? Perhaps you have missed the spot  where you left him.\"    \"They're both gone.\"    Nell and Jim gazed at each other with slowly whitening faces.    \"Come, I'll take you up to the village,\" said Zane, getting out of  his canoe. All noticed that he was careful to take his weapons with  him.    \"Can't you tell us what it means--this disappearance?\" asked Jim,  his voice low and anxious.    \"They're gone, canoe and all. I knew Wetzel was going, but I didn't  calkilate on the lad. Mebbe he followed Wetzel, mebbe he didn't,\"  answered the taciturn guide, and he spoke no more.    In his keen expectation and wonder as to what the village would be  like, Jim momentarily forgot his brother's disappearance, and when  he arrived at the top of the bank he surveyed the scene with  eagerness. What he saw was more imposing than the Village of Peace  which he had conjured up in his imagination. Confronting him was a  level plain, in the center of which stood a wide, low structure  surrounded by log cabins, and these in turn encircled by Indian  teepees. A number of large trees, mostly full-foliaged maples,  shaded the clearing. The settlement swarmed with Indians. A few  shrill halloes uttered by the first observers of the newcomers  brought braves, maidens and children trooping toward the party with  friendly curiosity.    Jonathan Zane stepped before a cabin adjoining the large structure,  and called in at the open door. A short, stoop-shouldered white man,  clad in faded linsey, appeared on the threshold. His serious, lined  face had the unmistakable benevolent aspect peculiar to most  teachers of the gospel.    \"Mr. Zeisberger, I've fetched a party from Fort Henry,\" said Zane,  indicating those he had guided. Then, without another word, never  turning his dark face to the right or left, he hurried down the lane  through the throng of Indians.    Jim remembered, as he saw the guide vanish over the bank of the  creek, that he had heard Colonel Zane say that Jonathan, as well as  Wetzel, hated the sight of an Indian. No doubt long years of war and  bloodshed had rendered these two great hunters callous. To them  there could be no discrimination--an Indian was an "]]]
