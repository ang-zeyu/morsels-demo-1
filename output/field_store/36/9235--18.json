But, as I had not laid in a store of provision for  such a retreat, it was impossible that we could keep within doors  entirely. However, I attempted, though it was so very late, to do  something towards it; and first, as I had convenience both for brewing  and baking, I went and bought two sacks of meal, and for several weeks,  having an oven, we baked all our own bread; also I bought malt, and  brewed as much beer as all the casks I had would hold, and which seemed  enough to serve my house for five or six weeks; also I laid in a  quantity of salt butter and Cheshire cheese; but I had no flesh  meat,[131] and the plague raged so violently among the butchers and  slaughterhouses on the other side of our street, where they are known to  dwell in great numbers, that it was not advisable so much as to go over  the street among them.    And here I must observe again, that this necessity of going out of our  houses to buy provisions was in a great measure the ruin of the whole  city; for the people catched the distemper, on these occasions, one of  another; and even the provisions themselves were often tainted (at least  I have great reason to believe so), and therefore I cannot say with  satisfaction, what I know is repeated with great assurance, that the  market people, and such as brought provisions to town, were never  infected. I am certain the butchers of Whitechapel, where the greatest  part of the flesh meat was killed, were dreadfully visited, and that at  last to such a degree that few of their shops were kept open; and those  that remained of them killed their meat at Mile End, and that way, and  brought it to market upon horses.    However, the poor people could not lay up provisions, and there was a  necessity that they must go to market to buy, and others to send  servants or their children; and, as this was a necessity which renewed  itself daily, it brought abundance of unsound people to the markets; and  a great many that went thither sound brought death home with them.    It is true, people used all possible precaution. When any one bought a  joint of meat in the market, they[132] would not take it out of the  butcher's hand, but took it off the hooks themselves.[132] On the other  hand, the butcher would not touch the money, but have it put into a pot  full of vinegar, which he kept for that purpose. The buyer carried  always small money to make up any odd sum, that they might take no  change. They carried bottles for scents and perfumes in their hands, and  all the means that could be used were employed; but then the poor could  not do even these things, and they went at all hazards.    Innumerable dismal stories we heard every day on this very account.  Sometimes a man or woman dropped down dead in the very markets; for many  people that had the plague upon them knew nothing of it till the inward  gangrene had affected their vitals, and they died in a few moments. This  caused that many died frequently in that manner in the street suddenly,  without any warning: others, perhaps, had time to go to the next  bulk[133] or stall, or to any door or porch, and just sit down and die,  as I have said before.    These objects were so frequent in the streets, that when the plague came  to be very raging on one side, there was scarce any passing by the  streets but that several dead bodies would be lying here and there upon  the ground. On the other hand, it is observable, that though at first  the people would stop as they went along, and call to the neighbors to  come out on such an occasion, yet afterward no notice was taken of them;  but that, if at any time we found a corpse lying, go across the way and  not come near it; or, if in a narrow lane or passage, go back again, and  seek some other way to go on the business we were upon. And in those  cases the corpse was always left till the officers had notice to come  and take them away, or till night, when the bearers attending the dead  cart would take them up and carry them away. Nor did those undaunted  creatures who performed these offices fail to search their pockets, and  sometimes strip off their clothes, if they were well dressed, as  sometimes they were, and carry off what they could get.    But to return to the markets. The butchers took that care, that, if any  person died in the market, they had the officers always at hand to take  them up upon handbarrows, and carry them to the next churchyard; and  this was so frequent that such were not entered in the weekly bill,  found dead in the streets or fields, as is the case now, but they went  into the general articles of the great distemper.    But now the fury of the distemper increased to such a degree, that even  the markets were but very thinly furnished with provisions, or  frequented with buyers, compared to what they were before; and the lord  mayor caused the country people who brought provisions to be stopped in  the streets leading into the town, and to sit down there with their  goods, where they sold what they brought, and went immediately away. And  this encouraged the country people greatly to do so; for they sold their  provisions at the very entrances into the town, and even in the fields,  as particularly in the fields beyond Whitechapel, in Spittlefields.  Note, those streets now called Spittlefields were then indeed open  fields; also in St. George's Fields in Southwark, in Bunhill Fields, and  in a great field called Wood's Close, near Islington. Thither the lord  mayor, aldermen, and magistrates sent their officers and servants to buy  for their families, themselves keeping within doors as much as possible;  and the like did many other people. And after this method was taken, the  country people came with great cheerfulness, and brought provisions of  all sorts, and very seldom got any harm, which, I suppose, added also  to that report of their being miraculously preserved.[134]    As for my little family, having thus, as I have said, laid in a store of  bread, butter, cheese, and beer, I took my friend and physician's  advice, and locked myself up, and my family, and resolved to suffer the  hardship of living a few months without flesh meat rather than to  purchase it at the hazard of our lives.    But, though I confined my family, I could not prevail upon my  unsatisfied curiosity to stay within entirely myself, and, though I  generally came frighted and terrified home, yet I could not restrain,  only that, indeed, I did not do it so frequently as at first.    I had some little obligations, indeed, upon me to go to my brother's  house, which was in Coleman Street Parish, and which he had left to my  care; and I went at first every day, but afterwards only once or twice a  week.    In these walks I had many dismal scenes before my eyes, as,  particularly, of persons falling dead in the streets, terrible shrieks  and screechings of women, who in their agonies would throw open their  chamber windows, and cry out in a dismal surprising manner. It is  impossible to describe the variety of postures in which the passions of  the poor people would express themselves.    Passing through Token-House Yard in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement  violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful  screeches, and then cried, \"O death, death, death!\" in a most inimitable  tone, and which[135] struck me with horror, and[136] a chillness in my  very blood. There was nobody to be seen in the whole street, neither did  any other window open, for people had no curiosity now in any case, nor  could anybody help one another: so I went on to pass into Bell Alley.    Just in Bell Alley, on the right hand of the passage, there was a more  terrible cry than that, though it was not so directed out at the window.  But the whole family was in a terrible fright, and I could hear women  and children run screaming about the rooms like distracted, when a  garret window opened, and somebody from a window on the other side the  alley called, and asked, \"What is the matter?\" Upon which from the first  window it was answered, \"O Lord, my old master has hanged himself!\" The  other asked again, \"Is he quite dead?\" and the first answered, \"Ay, ay,  quite dead; quite dead and cold!\" This person was a merchant and a  deputy alderman, and very rich. I care not to mention his name, though I  knew his name too; but that would be a hardship to the family, which is  now flourishing again.[137]    But this is but one. It is scarce credible what dreadful cases happened  in particular families every day,--people, in the rage of the distemper,  or in the torment of their swellings, which was indeed intolerable,  running out of their own government,[138] raving and distracted, and  oftentimes laying violent hands upon themselves, throwing themselves out  at their windows, shooting themselves, etc.; mothers murdering their own  children in their lunacy; some dying of mere grief as a passion, some of  mere fright and surprise without any infection at all; others frighted  into idiotism[139] and foolish distractions, some into despair and  lunacy, others into melancholy madness.    The pain of the swelling was in particular very violent, and to some  intolerable. The physicians and surgeons may be said to have tortured  many poor creatures even to death. The swellings in some grew hard, and  they applied violent drawing plasters, or poultices, to break them; and,  if these did not do, they cut and scarified them in a terrible manner.  In some, those swellings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#16)"],[1,"s. He rode up to a rise of ground and scanned the country  suspiciously before he led the way into the creek bed. Even then he kept  close under the bank until they had passed two of the quarter-mile posts  that had been planted in the hard sand.    Evidently he had been doing a good deal of thinking during the ride;  certainly he had watched Smoky. When he stopped under the bank opposite  the half-mile post he dismounted more spryly than one would have  expected. His eyes were bright, his voice sharp. Pop was forgetting his  age.    \"I guess I'll ride yore horse m'self,\" he announced, and they exchanged  horses under the shelter of the bank. \"You kin take an' ride Boise-an'  I want you should beat me if you kin.\" He looked at Bud appraisingly.  \"I'll bet a dollar,\" he cried suddenly, \"that I kin outrun ye, young  feller! An' you got the fastest horse in Burroback Valley and I don't  know what I got under me. I'm seventy years old come September--when I'm  afoot. Are ye afraid to bet?\"    \"I'm scared a dollar's worth that I'll never see you again to-day unless  I ride back to find you,\" Bud grinned.    \"Any time you lose ole Pop Truman--shucks almighty! Come on, then--I'll  show ye the way to the quarter-post!\"    \"I'm right with you, Pop. You say so, and I'm gone!\"    They reined in with the shadow of the post falling square across the  necks of both horses. Pop gathered up the reins, set his feet in the  stirrups and shrilled, \"Go, gol darn ye!\"    They went, like two scared rabbits down the smooth, yellow stretch of  packed sand. Pop's elbows stuck straight out, he held the reins high  and leaned far over Smoky's neck, his eyes glaring. Bud--oh, never worry  about Bud! In the years that lay between thirteen and twenty-one Bud  had learned a good many things, and one of them was how to get out of a  horse all the speed there was in him.    They went past the quarter-post and a furlong beyond before either could  pull up. Pop was pale and triumphant, and breathing harder than his  mount.    \"Here 's your dollar, Pop--and don't you talk in your sleep!\" Bud  admonished, smiling as he held out the dollar, but with an anxious  tone in his voice. \"If this is the best running horse you've got in the  valley, I may get some action, next Sunday!\"    Pop dismounted, took the dollar with a grin and mounted Boise--and that  in spite of the fact that Boise was keyed up and stepping around and  snorting for another race. Bud watched Pop queerly, remembering how  feeble had been the old man whom he had met at the corral.    \"Say, Pop, you ought to race a little every day,\" he bantered. \"You're  fifteen years younger than you were an hour ago.\"    For answer Pop felt of his back and groaned. \"Oh, I'll pay fer it, young  feller! I don't look fer much peace with my back fer a week, after this.  But you kin make sure of one thing, and that is, I ain't goin' to talk  in my sleep none. By Christmas, We'll make this horse of yours bring  us in something! I guess you better turn yore horses all out in the  pasture. Dave, he'll give yuh work all right. I'll fix it with Dave.  And you listen to Pop, young feller. I'll show ye a thing or two  about runnin' horses. You'n me'll clean up a nice little bunch of  money-HE-HE!-beat Boise in a quarter dash! Tell that to Dave, an' he  wouldn't b'lieve ye!\"    When Pop got off at the back of the stable he could scarcely move,  he was so stiff. But his mind was working well enough to see that Bud  rubbed the saddle print off Boise and turned his own horses loose in the  pasture, before he let him go on to the house. The last Bud heard from  Pop that forenoon was a senile chuckle and a cackling, \"Outrun Boise  in a quarter dash! Shucks a'mighty! But I knew it--I knew he had the  speed--sho! Ye can't fool ole Pop--shucks!\"        CHAPTER TEN: BUD MEETS THE WOMAN    A woman was stooping at the woodpile, filling her arms with crooked  sticks of rough-barked sage. From the color of her hair Bud knew that  she was not Honey, and that she was therefore a stranger to him. But he  swung off the path and went over to her as naturally as he would go to  pick up a baby that had fallen.    \"I'll carry that in for you,\" he said, and put out his hand to help her  to her feet.    Before he touched her she was on her feet and looking at him. Bud could  not remember afterwards that she had done anything else; he seemed to  have seen only her eyes, and into them and beyond them to a soul that  somehow made his heart tremble.    What she said, what he answered, was of no moment. He could not have  told afterwards what it was. He stooped and filled his arms with wood,  and walked ahead of her up the pathway to the kitchen door, and stopped  when she flitted past him to show him where the wood-box stood. He was  conscious then of her slenderness and of the lightness of her steps.  He dropped the wood into the box behind the stove on which kettles  were steaming. There was the smell of chicken stewing, and the odor of  fresh-baked pies.    She smiled up at him and offered him a crisp, warn cookie with sugared  top, and he saw her eyes again and felt the same tremor at his heart.  He pulled himself together and smiled back at her, thanked her and went  out, stumbling a little on the doorstep, the cookie untasted in his  fingers.    He walked down to the corral and began fumbling at his pack, his  thoughts hushed before the revelation that had come to him.    \"Her hands--her poor, little, red hands!\" he said in a whisper as the  memory of them came suddenly. But it was her eyes that he was seeing  with his mind; her eyes, and what lay deep within. They troubled him,  shook him, made him want to use his man-strength against something that  was hurting her. He did not know what it could be; he did not know that  there was anything--but oddly the memory of his mother's white face back  in the long ago, and of her tone when she said, \"Oh, God, please!\" came  back and fitted themselves to the look in this woman's eyes.    Bud sat down on his canvas-wrapped bed and lifted his hat to rumple his  hair and then smooth it again, as was his habit when worried. He looked  at the cookie, and because he was hungry he ate it with a foolish  feeling that he was being sentimental as the very devil, thinking how  her hands had touched it. He rolled and smoked a cigarette afterwards,  and wondered who she was and whether she was married, and what her first  name was.    A quiet smoke will bring a fellow to his senses sometimes when  nothing else will, and Bud managed, by smoking two cigarettes in rapid  succession, to restore himself to some degree of sanity.    \"Funny how she made me think of mother, back when I was a kid coming up  from Texas,\" he mused. \"Mother'd like her.\" It was the first time he had  ever thought just that about a girl. \"She's no relation to Honey,\" he  added. \"I'd bet a horse on that.\" He recalled how white and soft were  Honey's hands, and he swore a little. \"Wouldn't hurt her to get out  there in the kitchen and help with the cooking,\" he criticised. Then  suddenly he laughed. \"Shucks a'mighty, as Pop says! with those two girls  on the ranch I'll gamble Dave Truman has a full crew of men that are  plumb willing to work for their board!\"    The stage came, and Bud turned to it relievedly. After that, here came  Dave Truman on a deep-cheated roan. Bud knew him by his resemblance to  the old man, who came shuffling bent-backed from the machine-shed as  Dave passed.    Pop beckoned, and Dave reined his horse that way and stopped at the shed  door. The two talked for a minute and Dave rode on, passing Bud with a  curt nod. Pop came over to where Bud stood leaning against the corral.    \"How are you feeling, dad?\" Bud grinned absently.    \"Purty stiff an' sore, boy--my rheumatics is bad to-day.\" Pop winked  solemnly. \"I spoke to Dave about you wantin' a job, and I guess likely  Dave'll put you on. They's plenty to do--hayin' comin' on and all that.\"  He lowered his voice mysteriously, though there was no man save Bud  within a hundred feet of him. \"Don't ye go 'n talk horses--not yet.  Don't let on like yore interested much. I'll tell yuh when to take 'em  up.\"    The men came riding in from the hayfield, some in wagons, two astride  harnessed work-horses, and one long-legged fellow in chaps on a mower,  driving a sweaty team that still had life enough to jump sidewise when  they spied Bud's pack by the corral. The stage driver sauntered up and  spoke to the men. Bud went over and began to help unhitch the team from  the mower, and the driver eyed him sharply while he grinned his greeting  across the backs of the horses.    \"Pop says you're looking for work,\" Dave Truman observed, coming up.  \"Well, if you ain't scared of it, I'll stake yuh to a hayfork after  dinner. Where yuh from?\"    \"Just right now, I'm from the Muleshoe. Bud Birnie's my name. I was  telling dad why I quit.\"    \"Tell me,\" Dave directed briefly. \"Pop ain't as reliable as he used to  be. He'd never get it out straight.\"    \"I quit,\" said Bud, \"by special request.\" He pulled off his gloves  carefully and held up his puffed knuckles. \"I got that on Dirk Tracy.\"    The driver of the mower shot a quick, meaning glance at Dave, and  laughed shortly. Dave grinned a little, but he did not ask what had been  the trouble, as Bud had half expected him to do. Apparently Dave felt  that he had received all the information he needed, for his next remark  had to do with the heat. The day was a \"weather breeder\", he declared,  and he was glad to have another man to put at the hauling.    An iron triangle beside the kitchen door clamored then, and Bud, looking  quickly, saw the slim little woman with the big, troubled eyes striking  the iron bar vigorously. Dave glanced at his watch and led the way to  the house, the hay crew hurrying after him.    Fourteen men sat down to a long table with a great shuffling of feet and  scraping of benches, and immediately"]]]
