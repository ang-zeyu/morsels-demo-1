There may be    opposition in the internal affairs, but a paper which in Prussia    takes part against the policy of the King on behalf of foreign    countries, must be regarded as dishonoured and treated as such.\"    Politically his position was very difficult; the Diet had been restored  by Austria against the will of Prussia; the very presence of a Prussian  Envoy in Frankfort was a sign of her humiliation. He had indeed gone  there full of friendly dispositions towards Austria; he was instructed  to take up again the policy which had been pursued before 1848, when all  questions of importance had been discussed by the two great Powers  before they were laid before the Diet. Bismarck, however, quickly found  that this was no longer the intention of Austria; the Austria which he  had so chivalrously defended at Berlin did not exist; he had expected to  find a warm and faithful friend--he found a cunning and arrogant enemy.  Schwarzenberg had spared Prussia but he intended to humble her; he  wished to use the Diet as a means of permanently asserting the  supremacy of Austria, and he would not be content until Prussia had been  forced like Saxony or Bavaria to acquiesce in the position of a vassal  State. The task might not seem impossible, for Prussia appeared to be on  the downward path.    Of course the Diet of Frankfort was the place where the plan had to be  carried out; it seemed an admirable opportunity that Prussia was  represented there by a young and untried man. Count Thun and his  successors used every means to make it appear as though Prussia was a  State not of equal rank with Austria. They carried the war into society  and, as diplomatists always will, used the outward forms of social  intercourse as a means for obtaining political ends. On this field,  Bismarck was quite capable of meeting them. He has told many stories of  their conflicts.    As President of the Diet, Thun claimed privileges for himself which  others did not dare to dispute.      \"In the sittings of the military commission when Rochow was    Prussian envoy, Austria alone smoked. Rochow, who was a    passionate smoker, would also have gladly done so, but did not    venture. When I came I did not see any reason against it; and    asked for a light from the Presiding State; this seemed to be    noticed with astonishment and displeasure by him and the other    gentlemen; it was obviously an event for them. This time only    Austria and Prussia smoked. But the others obviously held it so    important that they sent home a report on it. Someone must have    written about it to Berlin, as a question from the late King    arrived; he did not smoke himself and probably did not find the    affair to his taste. It required much consideration at the    smaller Courts, and for quite half a year only the two great    Powers smoked. Then Schrenk, the Bavarian envoy, began to    maintain the dignity of his position by smoking. The Saxon    Nostitz would doubtless have liked to begin too, but I suppose he    had not yet received permission from his Minister. But when next    time he saw that Bothmer, the Hanoverian, allowed himself a    cigar, he must have come to an understanding with his neighbour    (he was a good Austrian, and had sons in the Austrian army), for    he brought out his pouch and lit up. There remained only the    Wuertemberger and the Darmstadter, and they did not smoke at all,    but the honour and the importance of their States required it,    and so on the following day the Wuertemberger really brought out    his cigar. I can see him with it now, a long, thin, yellow thing,    the colour of rye-straw,--and with sulky determination, as a    sacrifice for his Swabian fatherland, he smoked at least half of    it. Hesse-Darmstadt alone refrained.\"    On another occasion Thun received Bismarck in his shirt sleeves: \"You  are quite right,\" said Bismarck, \"it is very hot,\" and took off his own  coat.    In the transaction of business he found the same thing. The plan seemed  to be deliberately to adopt a policy disadvantageous to Prussia, to  procure the votes of a majority of the States, thereby to cause Prussia  to be outvoted, and to leave her in the dilemma of accepting a decision  which was harmful to herself or of openly breaking with the Federation.  On every matter which came up the same scenes repeated themselves; now  it was the disposal of the fleet, which had to a great extent been  provided for and maintained by Prussian money; Austria demanded that it  should be regarded as the property of the Confederation even though most  of the States had never paid their contribution. Then it was the  question of the Customs' Union; a strong effort was made by the  anti-Prussian party to overthrow the union which Prussia had established  and thereby ruin the one great work which she had achieved. Against  these and similar attempts Bismarck had constantly to be on the  defensive. Another time it was the publication of the proceedings of the  Diet which the Austrians tried to make a weapon against Prussia. The  whole intercourse became nothing but a series of disputes, sometimes  serious, sometimes trivial.    Bismarck was soon able to hold his own; poor Count Thun, whose nerves  were not strong, after a serious discussion with him used to go to bed  at five o'clock in the afternoon; he complained that his health would  not allow him to hold his post if there were to be continuous quarrels.  When his successor, Herr v. Prokesch, left Frankfort for Constantinople,  he said that \"it would be like an Eastern dream of the blessed to  converse with the wise Ali instead of Bismarck.\"    As soon as the first strangeness had passed off Bismarck became  reconciled to his position. His wife and children joined him, he made  himself a comfortable home, and his house soon became one of the most  popular in the town; he and his wife were genial and hospitable and he  used his position to extend his own influence and that of his country.  His old friend, Motley, visited him there in 1855 and wrote to his wife:                                              \"FRANKFORT,                                            \"Monday, July 30, 1855.      \" ... The Bismarcks are as kind as ever--nothing can be more    frank and cordial than her manners. I am there all day long. It    is one of those houses where everyone does what he likes. The    show apartments where they receive formal company are on the    front of the house. Their living rooms, however, are a _salon_    and dining-room at the back, opening upon the garden. Here there    are young and old, grandparents and children and dogs all at    once, eating, drinking, smoking, piano-playing, and pistol-firing    (in the garden), all going on at the same time. It is one of    those establishments where every earthly thing that can be eaten    or drunk is offered you; porter, soda water, small beer,    champagne, burgundy, or claret are about all the time, and    everybody is smoking the best Havana cigars every minute.\"    He had plenty of society, much of it congenial to him. He had given up  playing since his marriage, and was one of the few diplomatists who was  not found at the Homburg gaming-tables, but he had a sufficiency of  sport and joined with the British envoy, Sir Alexander Malet, in taking  some shooting. A couple of years later in contradicting one of the  frequent newspaper reports, that he aimed at supplanting the Minister,  he says:      \"My castle in the air is to spend three to five years longer at    Frankfort, then perhaps the same time in Vienna or Paris, then    ten years with glory as Minister, then die as a country    gentleman.\"    A prospect which has been more nearly fulfilled than such wishes  generally are.    He was for the first year still a member of the Second Chamber and  occasionally appeared in it; his interest in his diplomatic work had,  however, begun to overshadow his pleasure in Parliamentary debate.      \"I am thoroughly tired of my life here,\" he writes in May, 1853,    to his wife from Berlin, \"and long for the day of my departure. I    find the intrigues of the House immeasurably shallow and    undignified; if one always lives among them, one deceives oneself    and considers them something wonderful. When I come here from    Frankfort and see them as they really are, I feel like a sober    man who has fallen among drunkards. There is something very    demoralising in the air of the Chambers; it makes the best people    vain without their knowing it.\"    So quickly has he outgrown his feelings of a year ago: then it was the  intrigues of diplomatists that had seemed to him useless and  demoralising. Now it was Parliamentary debates; in the opinion he formed  at this time he never wavered.    His distaste for Parliamentary life was probably increased by an event  which took place about this time. As so often before in the course of  debate he had a sharp passage of words with Vincke; the latter referred  contemptuously to Bismarck's diplomatic achievements. \"All I know of  them is the famous lighted cigar.\"    Bismarck answered with some angry words and at the close of the sitting  sent a challenge. Four days later a duel with pistols took place--the  only one he ever fought. Neither was injured. It seems that Vincke, who  had the first shot, seeing that Bismarck (who had received the sacrament  the night before) was praying, missed on purpose; Bismarck then shot  into the air.    For these reasons he did not stand for re-election when the Chamber was  dissolved in 1852, although the King was very much displeased with his  determination. He was shortly afterwards appointed member of the newly  constituted House of Lords, but though he occasionally voted, as in duty  bound, for Government measures, he never spoke; he was not to be heard  again in the Parliament until he appeared there as President of the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#16)"],[1,"as a manure for the fields;  whereas the people have to-day assured me that it is of so hard, stony,  and untractable a nature, as to be literally good for nothing. Here I know  it is thrown away by cart-loads into the river, where its only use appears  to be to act like ground bait, and attract a vast quantity of small fish  to its vicinity. The number of hands employed in this threshing-mill is  very considerable, and the whole establishment, comprising the fires and  boilers and machinery of a powerful steam engine, are all under negro  superintendence and direction. After this survey, I occupied myself with  my infant plantation of evergreens round the dyke, in the midst of which  interesting pursuit I was interrupted by a visit from Mr. B----, a  neighbouring planter, who came to transact some business with Mr. ----  about rice which he had sent to our mill to have threshed, and the price  to be paid for such threshing. The negroes have presented a petition  to-day that they may be allowed to have a ball in honour of our arrival,  which demand has been acceded to, and furious preparations are being set  on foot.    On visiting the Infirmary to-day, I was extremely pleased with the  increased cleanliness and order observable in all the rooms. Two little  filthy children, however, seemed to be still under the _ancien regime_ of  non-ablution; but upon my saying to the old nurse Molly, in whose ward  they were, 'Why, Molly, I don't believe you have bathed those children  to-day,' she answered, with infinite dignity, 'Missis no b'lieve me wash  um piccaninny! and yet she tress me wid all um niggar when 'em sick.' The  injured innocence and lofty conscious integrity of this speech silenced  and abashed me; and yet I can't help it, but I don't believe to this  present hour that those children had had any experience of water, at least  not washing water, since they first came into the world.    I rowed over to Darien again, to make some purchases, yesterday; and  enquiring the price of various articles, could not but wonder to find  them at least three times as dear as in your northern villages. The  profits of these southern shopkeepers (who, for the most part, are  thoroughbred Yankees, with the true Yankee propensity to trade, no matter  on how dirty a counter, or in what manner of wares) are enormous. The  prices they ask for everything, from coloured calicoes for negro dresses  to pianofortes (one of which, for curiosity sake, I enquired the value  of), are fabulous, and such as none but the laziest and most reckless  people in the world would consent to afford. On our return we found the  water in the cut so extremely low that we were obliged to push the boat  through it, and did not accomplish it without difficulty. The banks of  this canal, when they are thus laid bare, present a singular appearance  enough,--two walls of solid mud, through which matted, twisted, twined,  and tangled, like the natural veins of wood, runs an everlasting net of  indestructible roots, the thousand toes of huge cypress feet. The trees  have been cut down long ago from the soil, but these fangs remain in the  earth without decaying for an incredible space of time. This long  endurance of immersion is one of the valuable properties of these cypress  roots; but though excellent binding stuff for the sides of a canal, they  must be pernicious growth in any land used for cultivation that requires  deep tillage. On entering the Altamaha, we found the tide so low that we  were much obstructed by the sand banks, which, but for their constant  shifting, would presently take entire possession of this noble stream,  and render it utterly impassable from shore to shore, as it already is in  several parts of the channel at certain seasons of the tide. On landing,  I was seized hold of by a hideous old negress, named Sinda, who had come  to pay me a visit, and of whom Mr. ---- told me a strange anecdote. She  passed at one time for a prophetess among her fellow slaves on the  plantation, and had acquired such an ascendancy over them that, having  given out, after the fashion of Mr. Miller, that the world was to come to  an end at a certain time, and that not a very remote one, the belief in  her assertion took such possession of the people on the estate, that they  refused to work; and the rice and cotton fields were threatened with an  indefinite fallow, in consequence of this strike on the part of the  cultivators. Mr. K----, who was then overseer of the property, perceived  the impossibility of arguing, remonstrating, or even flogging this solemn  panic out of the minds of the slaves. The great final emancipation which  they believed at hand had stripped even the lash of its prevailing  authority, and the terrors of an overseer for once were as nothing, in  the terrible expectation of the advent of the universal Judge of men.  They were utterly impracticable--so, like a very shrewd man as he was, he  acquiesced in their determination not to work; but he expressed to them  his belief that Sinda was mistaken, and he warned her that if, at the  appointed time, it proved so, she would be severely punished. I do not  know whether he confided to the slaves what he thought likely to be the  result if she was in the right; but poor Sinda was in the wrong. Her day  of judgement came indeed, and a severe one it proved, for Mr. K---- had  her tremendously flogged, and her end of things ended much like Mr.  Miller's; but whereas he escaped unhanged, in spite of his atrocious  practices upon the fanaticism and credulity of his country people, the  spirit of false prophecy was mercilessly scourged out of her, and the  faith of her people of course reverted from her to the omnipotent lash  again. Think what a dream that must have been while it lasted, for those  infinitely oppressed people,--freedom without entering it by the grim  gate of death, brought down to them at once by the second coming of  Christ, whose first advent has left them yet so far from it! Farewell; it  makes me giddy to think of having been a slave while that delusion  lasted, and after it vanished.           *       *       *       *       *      Dearest E----. I received early this morning a visit from a young negro,  called Morris, who came to request permission to be baptised. The master's  leave is necessary for this ceremony of acceptance into the bosom of the  Christian Church; so all that can be said is, that it is to be hoped the  rite itself may _not_ be indispensable for salvation, as if Mr. ---- had  thought proper to refuse Morris' petition, he must infallibly have been  lost, in spite of his own best wishes to the contrary. I could not, in  discoursing with him, perceive that he had any very distinct ideas of the  advantages he expected to derive from the ceremony; but perhaps they  appeared all the greater for being a little vague. I have seldom seen a  more pleasing appearance than that of this young man; his figure was tall  and straight, and his face, which was of a perfect oval, rejoiced in the  grace, very unusual among his people, of a fine high forehead, and the  much more frequent one of a remarkably gentle and sweet expression. He  was, however, jet black, and certainly did not owe these personal  advantages to any mixture in his blood. There is a certain African tribe  from which the West Indian slave market is chiefly recruited, who have  these same characteristic features, and do not at all present the ignoble  and ugly negro type, so much more commonly seen here. They are a tall,  powerful people, with remarkably fine figures, regular features, and a  singularly warlike and fierce disposition, in which respect they also  differ from the race of negroes existing on the American plantations. I do  not think Morris, however, could have belonged to this tribe, though  perhaps Othello did, which would at once settle the difficulties of those  commentators who, abiding by Iago's very disagreeable suggestions as to  his purely African appearance, are painfully compelled to forego the  mitigation of supposing him a Moor and not a negro. Did I ever tell you of  my dining in Boston, at the H----'s, on my first visit to that city, and  sitting by Mr. John Quincy Adams, who, talking to me about Desdemona,  assured me, with a most serious expression of sincere disgust, that he  considered all her misfortunes as a very just judgement upon her for  having married a 'nigger?' I think if some ingenious American actor of  the present day, bent upon realising Shakespeare's finest conceptions,  with all the advantages of modern enlightenment, could contrive to slip in  that opprobrious title, with a true South-Carolinian anti-Abolitionist  expression, it might really be made quite a point for Iago, as, for  instance, in his first soliloquy--'I hate the nigger,' given in proper  Charleston or Savannah fashion, I am sure would tell far better than 'I  hate the Moor.' Only think, E----, what a very new order of interest the  whole tragedy might receive, acted throughout from this standpoint, as the  Germans call it in this country, and called 'Amalgamation, or the Black  Bridal.'    On their return from their walk this afternoon, the children brought home  some pieces of sugar-cane, of which a small quantity grows on the island.  When I am most inclined to deplore the condition of the poor slaves on  these cotton and rice plantations, the far more intolerable existence and  harder labour of those employed on the sugar estates occurs to me,  sometimes producing the effect of a lower circle in Dante's 'Hell of  Horrors,' opening beneath the one where he seems to have reached the  climax of infernal punishment. You may have seen this vegetable, and must,  at any rate, I should think, be familiar with it by description. It is a  long green reed, like the stalk of the maize, or Indian corn, only it  shoots up to a much more considerable height, and has a consistent pith,"]]]
