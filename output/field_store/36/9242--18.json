The working-day commenced then, as       now, at sunrise, and lasted till sunset, with a short       interval of one or two hours at midday for the workmen's       dinner and siesta.         ** Literally, \"He places himself on his elbow.\" The metaphor       seems to me to be taken from the practice of the trade       itself: the barber keeps his elbow raised when shaving and       lowers it when he is eating.         *** This passage is conjecturally translated. I suppose the       Egyptian masons had a custom analogous to that of our own,       and attached a bunch of lotus to the highest part of a       building they had just finished: nothing, however, has come       to light to confirm this conjecture.    --his two arms are worn out with work; his provisions are placed  higgledy piggledy amongst his refuse,--he consumes himself, for he has  no other bread than his fingers--and he becomes wearied all at once.--He  is much and dreadfully exhausted--for there is [always] a block [to be  dragged] in this or that building,--a block of ten cubits by six,--there  is [always] a block [to be dragged] in this or that month [as far as  the] scaffolding poles [to which is fixed] the bunch of lotus-flowers  on the [completed] houses.--When the work is quite finished,--if he has  bread, he returns home,--and his children have been beaten unmercifully  [during his absence].--The weaver within doors is worse off there than  a woman;--squatting, his knees against his chest,--he does not  breathe.--If during the day he slackens weaving,--he is bound fast as  the lotuses of the lake;--and it is by giving bread to the doorkeeper,  that the latter permits him to see the light.

This Picture belongs to the XVIIIth       dynasty; but the sandals in it are, however, quite like       those to be seen on more ancient monuments.    The dyer, his fingers reeking--and their smell is that of  fish-spawn;--his two eyes are oppressed with fatigue,--his hand does not  stop,--and, as he spends his time in cutting out rags--he has a  hatred of garments.--The shoemaker is very unfortunate;--he moans  ceaselessly,--his health is the health of the spawning fish,--and he  gnaws the leather.--The baker makes dough,--subjects the loaves to the  fire;--while his head is inside the oven,--his son holds him by the  legs;--if he slips from the hands of his son,--he falls there into the  flames.\" These are the miseries inherent to the trades themselves: the  levying of the tax added to the catalogue a long sequel of vexations  and annoyances, which were renewed several times in the year at regular  intervals.    [Illustration: 101.jpg THE BAKER MAKING HIS BREAD AND PLACING IT IN THE  OVEN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the painted picture in one of       the small antechambers of the tomb of Ramses III., at Bab-       el-Moluk.    Even at the present day, the fellah does not pay his contributions  except under protest and by compulsion, but the determination not to  meet obligations except beneath the stick, was proverbial from ancient  times: whoever paid his dues before he had received a merciless beating  would be overwhelmed with reproaches by his family, and jeered at  without pity by his neighbours. The time when the tax fell due, came  upon the nomes as a terrible crisis which affected the whole population.  For several days there was nothing to be heard but protestations,  threats, beating, cries of pain from the tax-payers, and piercing  lamentations from women and children. The performance over, calm was  re-established, and the good people, binding up their wounds, resumed  their round of daily life until the next tax-gathering.    The towns of this period presented nearly the same confined and  mysterious appearance as those of the present day.*         * I have had occasion to make \"soundings\" or excavations at       various points in very ancient towns and villages, at       Thebes, Abydos and Mataniyeh, and I give here a _resume_ of       my observations. Professor Petrie has brought to light and       regularly explored several cities of the XIIth and XVIIIth       dynasties, situated at the entrance to the Fayum. I have       borrowed many points in my description from the various       works which he has published on the subject, _Kahun, Gurob       and Hawara,_ 1890; and _Illahun, Kahun and Gurob_, 1891.    [Illustration: 103.jpg THE HOUSE OF A GREAT EGYPTIAN LORD]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a water-colour by Boussac, _Le       Tombeau d'Anna_ in the _Memoires de la Mission Francaise_.       The house was situated at Thebes, and belonged to the       XVIIIth dynasty. The remains of the houses brought to light       by Mariette at Abydos belong to the same type, and date back       to the XIIth dynasty. By means of these, Mariette was       enabled to reconstruct an ancient Egyptian house at the       Paris Exhibition of 1877. The picture of the tomb of Anna       reproduces in most respects, we may therefore assume, the       appearance of a nobleman's dwelling at all periods. At the       side of the main building we see two corn granaries with       conical roofs, and a great storehouse for provisions.    They were grouped around one or more temples, each of which was  surrounded by its own brick enclosing wall, with its enormous gateways:  the gods dwelt there in real castles, or, if this word appears too  ambitious, redouts, in which the population could take refuge in cases  of sudden attack, and where they could be in safety.    [Illustration: 104.jpg PLAN OF A PART OF THE ANCIENT TOWN OF KAHUN]         From a plan made and published by Professor Flinders Petrie,       _Illahun, Kahun and Gurob_, pl. xiv.      The towns, which had all been built at one period by some king or  prince, were on a tolerably regular ground plan; the streets were paved  and fairly wide; they crossed each other at right angles, and were  bordered with buildings on the same line of frontage. The cities of  ancient origin, which had increased with the chance growth of centuries,  presented a totally different aspect.    [Illustration: 105.jpg STELE OF SITU, REPRESENTING THE FRONT OF A HOUSE]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey. The       monument is the stele of Situ (IVth dynasty), in the Gizeh       Museum.    A network of lanes and blind alleys, narrow, dark, damp, and badly  built, spread itself out between the houses, apparently at random: here  and there was an arm of a canal, all but dried up, or a muddy pool where  the cattle came to drink, and from which the women fetched the water for  their households; then followed an open space of irregular shape, shaded  by acacias or sycamores, where the country-folk of the suburbs held  their market on certain days, twice or thrice a month; then came  waste ground covered with filth and refuse, over which the dogs of  the neighbourhood fought with hawks and vultures. The residence of  the prince or royal governor, and the houses of rich private persons,  covered a considerable area, and generally presented to the street a  long extent of bare walls, crenellated like those of a fortress: the  only ornament admitted on them consisted of angular grooves, each  surmounted by two open lotus flowers having their stems intertwined.    [Illustration: 106.jpg A STREET IN THE HIGHER QUARTER OF MODERN SIUT]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph, taken in 1884, by Emil       Brugsch-Bey.    Within these walls domestic life was entirely secluded, and as it were  confined to its own resources; the pleasure of watching passers-by was  sacrificed to the advantage of not being seen from outside. The entrance  alone denoted at times the importance of the great man who concealed  himself within the enclosure. Two or three steps led up to the door,  which sometimes had a columned portico, ornamented with statues, lending  an air of importance to the building. The houses of the citizens were  small, and built of brick; they contained, however, some half-dozen  rooms, either vaulted, or having flat roofs, and communicating with each  other usually by arched doorways.    [Illustration: 107.jpg A HALL WITH COLUMNS IN ONE OF THE XIIth DYNASTY  HOUSES AT GUROB]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Professor Petrie,       _Elahun, Kahun and Gurob_, pl. xvi. 3.    A few houses boasted of two or three stories; all possessed a terrace,  on which the Egyptians of old, like those of to-day, passed most  of their time, attending to household cares or gossiping with their  neighbours over the party wall or across the street. The hearth was  hollowed out in the ground, usually against a wall, and the smoke  escaped through a hole in the ceiling: they made their fires of sticks,  wood charcoal, and the dung of oxen and asses.

The last independent King of Babylon, Nabonaid [Nabonidos], at length  discovered the cylinders in which Naramsin, son of Sargon, had signified  to posterity all that he had done towards the erection of a temple  worthy of the deity to the god of Sippara: \"for three thousand two  hundred years not one of the kings had been able to find them.\" We  have no means of judging what these edifices were like for which  the Chaldaeans themselves showed such veneration; they have entirely  disappeared, or, if anything remains of them, the excavations hitherto  carried out have not revealed it. Many small objects, however, which  have accidentally escaped destruction give us a fair idea of the artists  who lived in Babylon at this time, and of their skill in handling the  graving-tool and chisel. An alabaster vase with the name of  Naramsin, and a mace-head of exquisitely veined marble, dedicated by  Shargani-shar-ali to the sun-god of Sippara, are valued only on account  of the beauty of the material and the rarity of the inscription; but a  porphyry cylinder, which belonged to Ibnishar, scribe of the above-named  Shargani, must be ranked among the masterpieces of Oriental engraving.  It represents the hero Gilgames, kneeling and holding with both hands  a spherically shaped vase, from which flow two copious jets forming a  stream running through the country; an ox, armed with a pair of gigantic  crescent-shaped horns, throws back its head to catch one of the jets  as it falls. Everything in this little specimen is equally worthy of  admiration--the purity of outline, the skilful and delicate cutting of  the intaglio, the fidelity of the action, and the accuracy of form.  A fragment of a bas-relief of the reign of Naramsin shows that the  sculptors were not a bit behind the engravers of gems. This consists now  only of a single figure, a god, who is standing on the right, wearing a  conical head-dress and clothed in a hairy garment which leaves his right  arm free. The legs are wanting, the left arm and the hair are for  the most part broken away, while the features have also suffered; its  distinguishing characteristic is a sublety of workmanship which is  lacking in the artistic products of a later age. The outline stands out  from the background with a rare delicacy, the details of the muscles  being in no sense exaggerated: were it not for the costume and pointed  beard, one would fancy it a specimen of Egyptian work of the best  Memphite period.    [Illustration 096.jpg THE SEAL OF SHARGANI-SHAR-ALI: GILGAMES WATERS THE  CELESTIAL OX.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Menant.    One is almost tempted to believe in the truth of the tradition which  ascribes to Naramsin the conquest of Egypt, or of the neighbouring  countries.    [Illustration: 096a.jpg Painting in Color of Charioteer]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph published by Father       Schiel.    [Illustration: 097.jpg Page image]    Did Sargon and Naramsin live at so early a date as that assigned to  them by Nabonidos? The scribes who assisted the kings of the second  Babylonian empire in their archaeological researches had perhaps  insufficient reasons for placing the date of these kings so far back in  the misty past: should evidence of a serious character A constrain us to  attribute to them a later origin, we ought not to be surprised. In the  mean time our best course is to accept the opinion of the Chaldaeans,  and to leave Sargon and Naramsin in the century assigned to them by  Nabonidos, although from this point they look down as from a high  eminence upon all the rest of Chaldaean antiquity. Excavations have  brought to light several personages of a similar date, whether a  little earlier, or a little later: Bingani-sharali, Man-ish-turba,  and especially Alusharshid, who lived at Kishu and Nipur, and gained  victories over Elam.    [Illustration: 098.jpg Page image: the arms op the city and kings of  Lagash]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief from Lagash, now       in the Louvre    After this glimpse of light on these shadowy kings darkness once more  closes in upon us, and conceals from us the majority of the sovereigns  who ruled afterwards in Babylon. The facts and names which can be  referred with certainty to the following centuries belong not to  Babylon, but to the southern States, Lagash, Uruk, Uru, Nishin, and  Larsam. The national writers had neglected these principalities;  we possess neither a resume of their chronicles nor a list of their  dynasties, and the inscriptions which speak of their the arms of the  city gods and princes are still very rare and kings of Lagash. Lagash,  as far as our evidence goes, was, perhaps, the most illustrious of  all these cities.* It occupied the heart of the country, and its site  covered both sides of the Shatt-el-Hai; the Tigris separated it on the  east from Anshan, the westernmost of the Elamite districts, with which  it carried on a perpetual frontier war.         * We are indebted almost exclusively to the researches of M.       de Sarzec, and his discoveries at Telloh, for what we know       of it. The results of his excavations, acquired by the       French government, are now in the Louvre. The description of       the ruins, the text of the inscriptions, and an account of       the statues and other objects found in the course of the       work, have been published by Heuzey-Sakzec, _Decouvertes en       Chaldee_. The name of the ancient town has been read       Sirpurla, Zirgulla, etc.    All parts of the country were not equally fertile: the fruitful and  well-cultivated district in the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Hai gave  place to impoverished lands ending to the eastward, finally in swampy  marshes, which with great difficulty furnished means of sustenance to a  poor and thinly scattered population of fisher-folk.    [Illustration: 099.jpg FRAGMENT OF BAS-RELIEF BY URNINA, KING OF  LAGASH.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a stone in the Louvre.    The capital, built on the left bank of the river, stretched out to the  north-east and south-west a distance of some five miles. It was not so  much a city as an agglomeration of large villages, each grouped around a  temple or palace--Uruazagga, Gishgalla, G-irsu, Nina, and Lagash,  which latter imposed its name upon the whole. A branch of the river  Shatt-el-Hai protected it on the south, and supplied the village of  Nina with water; no trace of an inclosing wall has been found, and the  temples and palaces seem to have served as refuges in case of attack.  It had as its arms, or totem, a double-headed eagle standing on a lion  passant, or on two demi-lions placed back to back. Its chief god was  called Ningirsu, that is, the lord of Girsu, where his temple stood: his  companion Bau, and his associates Ninagal, Innanna and Ninsia, were  the deities of the other divisions of the city. The princes were first  called kings, but afterwards vicegerents--_patesi_--when they came under  the suzerainty of a more powerful king, the King of Uruk or of Babylon.    The earlier history of this remarkable town is made up of the  scanty memoirs of its rulers, together with those of the princes of  Gishban--\"the land of the Bow,\" of which Ishin seems to have been the  principal town. A very ancient document states, that, at the instigation  of Inlil, the god of Nipur, the local deities, Ningirsu and Kirsig, set  up a boundary between the two cities. In the course of time, Meshilim,  a king of Kishu, which, before the rise of Agade, was the chief town in  those parts, extended his dominion over Lagash and erected his stele at  its border; Ush, vicegerent of Gishban, however, removed it, and had to  suffer defeat before he would recognize the new order of things. After  the lapse of some years, of which we possess no records, we find the  mention of a certain Urukagina, who assumes the title of king: he  restored or enlarged several temples, and dug the canal which supplied  the town of Nina with water. A few generations later we find the ruling  authority in the hands of a certain Urnina, whose father Ninigaldun and  grandfather Gurshar received no titles--a fact which proves that they  could not have been reigning sovereigns. Urnina appears to have been of  a peaceful and devout disposition, as the inscriptions contain frequent  references to the edifices he had erected in honour of the gods, the  sacred objects he had dedicated to them, and the timber for building  purposes which he had brought from Magan, but there is no mention in  them of any war. His son Akurgal was also a builder of temples, but  his grandson Idingiranagin, who succeeded Akurgal, was a warlike and  combative prince.    [Illustration: 101.jpg IDINGIRANAGIN HOLDING THE TOTEM OF LAGASH.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the bas-relief F2 in the       Louvre.    It seems probable that, about that time, the kingdom of Gishban had  become a really powerful state. It had triumphed not only over  Babylonia proper, but over Kish, Uru, Uruk, and Larsam, while one of its  sovereigns had actually established his rule in some parts of Northern  Syria. Idingiranagin vanquished the troops of Gishban, and there is now  in the Louvre a trophy which he dedicated in the temple of Ninglrsu on  his return from the campaign.         * Hilpeecht, Bab.
