It must, however, be noted that a very large proportion of the  variations already recorded in the external parts of animals necessarily  imply corresponding internal variations. When feet and legs vary in  size, it is because the bones vary; when the head, body, limbs, and tail  change their proportions, the bony skeleton must also change; and even  when the wing or tail feathers of birds become longer or more numerous,  there is sure to be a corresponding change in the bones which support  and the muscles which move them. I will, however, give a few cases of  variations which have been directly observed.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Sciurus carolinensis. 32 specimens. Florida.]    Mr. Frank E. Beddard has kindly communicated to me some remarkable  variations he has observed in the internal organs of a species of  earthworm (Perionyx excavatus). The normal characters of this species  are--          Setae forming a complete row round each segment.        Two pairs of spermathecae--spherical pouches without      diverticulae--in segments 8 and 9.        Two pairs of testes in segments 11 and 12.        Ovaries, a single pair in segment 13.        Oviducts open by a common pore in the middle of segment 14.        Vasa deferentia open separately in segment 18, each furnished at      its termination with a large prostate gland.      Between two and three hundred specimens were examined, and among them  thirteen specimens exhibited the following marked variations:--          (1) The number of the spermathecae varied from two to three or      four pairs, their position also varying.        (2) There were occasionally two pairs of ovaries, each with its      own oviduct; the external apertures of these varied in position,      being upon segments 13 and 14, 14 and 15, or 15 and 16.      Occasionally when there was only the normal single oviduct pore      present it varied in position, once occurring on the 10th, and      once on the 11th segment.        (3) The male generative pores varied in position from segments      14 to 20. In one instance there were two pairs instead of the      normal single pair, and in this case each of the four apertures      had its own prostate gland.      Mr. Beddard remarks that all, or nearly all, the above variations are  found _normally_ in other genera and species.    When we consider the enormous number of earthworms and the comparatively  very small number of individuals examined, we may be sure, not only that  such variations as these occur with considerable frequency, but also  that still more extraordinary deviations from the normal structure may  often exist.    The next example is taken from Mr. Darwin's unpublished MSS.          \"In some species of Shrews (Sorex) and in some field-mice      (Arvicola), the Rev. L. Jenyns (_Ann. Nat. Hist._, vol. vii. pp.      267, 272) found the proportional length of the intestinal canal      to vary considerably. He found the same variability in the      number of the caudal vertebrae. In three specimens of an      Arvicola he found the gall-bladder having a very different      degree of development, and there is reason to believe it is      sometimes absent. Professor Owen has shown that this is the case      with the gall-bladder of the giraffe.\"      Dr. Crisp (_Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1862, p. 137) found the gall-bladder  present in some specimens of Cervus superciliaris while absent in  others; and he found it to be absent in three giraffes which he  dissected. A double gall-bladder was found in a sheep, and in a small  mammal preserved in the Hunterian Museum there are three distinct  gall-bladders.    The length of the alimentary canal varies greatly. In three adult  giraffes described by Professor Owen it was from 124 to 136 feet long;  one dissected in France had this canal 211 feet long; while Dr. Crisp  measured one of the extraordinary length of 254 feet, and similar  variations are recorded in other animals.[22]    The number of ribs varies in many animals. Mr. St. George Mivart says:  \"In the highest forms of the Primates, the number of true ribs is seven,  but in Hylobates there are sometimes eight pairs. In Semnopithecus and  Colobus there are generally seven, but sometimes eight pairs of true  ribs. In the Cebidae there are generally seven or eight pairs, but in  Ateles sometimes nine\" (_Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1865, p. 568). In the same  paper it is stated that the number of dorsal vertebrae in man is  normally twelve, very rarely thirteen. In the Chimpanzee there are  normally thirteen dorsal vertebrae, but occasionally there are fourteen  or only twelve.      _Variations in the Skull._    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Variation of Skull of Wolf. 10 specimens.]    Among the nine adult male Orang-utans, collected by myself in Borneo,  the skulls differed remarkably in size and proportions. The orbits  varied in width and height, the cranial ridge was either single or  double, either much or little developed, and the zygomatic aperture  varied considerably in size. I noted particularly that these  variations bore no necessary relation to each other, so that a large  temporal muscle and zygomatic aperture might exist either with a large  or a small cranium; and thus was explained the curious difference  between the single-crested and the double-crested skulls, which had been  supposed to characterise distinct species. As an instance of the amount  of variation in the skulls of fully adult male orangs, I found the width  between the orbits externally to be only 4 inches in one specimen and  fully 5 inches in another.    Exact measurements of large series of comparable skulls of the mammalia  are not easily found, but from those available I have prepared three  diagrams (Figs. 14, 15, and 16), in order to exhibit the facts of  variation in this very important organ. The first shows the variation in  ten specimens of the common wolf (Canis lupus) from one district in  North America, and we see that it is not only large in amount, but that  each part exhibits a considerable independent variability.[23]    In Diagram 15 we have the variations of eight skulls of the Indian  Honey-bear (Ursus labiatus), as tabulated by the late Dr. J.E. Gray of  the British Museum. For such a small number of specimens the amount of  variation is very large--from one-eighth to one-fifth of the mean  size,--while there are an extraordinary number of instances of  independent variability. In Diagram 16 we have the length and width of  twelve skulls of adult males of the Indian wild boar (Sus cristatus),  also given by Dr. Gray, exhibiting in both sets of measurements a  variation of more than one-sixth, combined with a very considerable  amount of independent variability.[24]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Variation of 8 skulls (Ursus labiatus).]    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    The few facts now given, as to variations of the internal parts of  animals, might be multiplied indefinitely by a search through the  voluminous writings of comparative anatomists. But the evidence already  adduced, taken in conjunction with the much fuller evidence of variation  in all external organs, leads us to the conclusion that wherever  variations are looked for among a considerable number of individuals of  the more common species they are sure to be found; that they are  everywhere of considerable amount, often reaching 20 per cent of the  size of the part implicated; and that they are to a great extent  independent of each other, and thus afford almost any combination of  variations that may be needed.    It must be particularly noticed that the whole series of  variation-diagrams here given (except the three which illustrate the  number of varying individuals) in every case represent the actual amount  of the variation, not on any reduced or enlarged scale, but as it were  life-size. Whatever number of inches or decimals of an inch the species  varies in any of its parts is marked on the diagrams, so that with the  help of an ordinary divided rule or a pair of compasses the variation of  the different parts can be ascertained and compared just as if the  specimens themselves were before the reader, but with much greater ease.    In my lectures on the Darwinian theory in America and in this country I  used diagrams constructed on a different plan, equally illustrating the  large amount of independent variability, but less simple and less  intelligible. The present method is a modification of that used by Mr.  Francis Galton in his researches on the theory of variability, the upper  line (showing the variability of the body) in Diagrams 4, 5, 6, and 13,  being laid down on the method he has used in his experiments with  sweet-peas and in pedigree moth-breeding.[25] I believe, after much  consideration, and many tedious experiments in diagram-making, that no  better method can be adopted for bringing before the eye, both the  amount and the peculiar features of individual variability.      _Variations of the Habits of Animals._    Closely connected with those variations of internal and external  structure which have been already described, are the changes of habits  which often occur in certain individuals or in whole species, since  these must necessarily depend upon some corresponding change in the  brain or in other parts of the organism; and as these changes are of  great importance in relation to the theory of instinct, a few examples  of them will be now adduced.    The Kea (Nestor notabilis) is a curious parrot inhabiting the mountain  ranges of the Middle Island of New Zealand. It belongs to the family of  Brush-tongued parrots, and naturally feeds on the honey of flowers and  the insects which frequent them, together with such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#16)"],[1,"or on theoretical  principles (e.g. the principle of inertia in Newton's Mechanics cannot be  visibly connected by facts seen in the external reality).    However, as in the external reality there are a huge number of facts difficult  to correlate, the method to find the fundamental symbolic model is guessing.  Once the model built, this will order in a univoque manner all the primary  facts. Moreover, it will make predictions that will lead to new discoveries or  confirmations of itself.    As we have shown in the general theory, we reflect sections of the external  reality in models. The models make predictions. If the predictions are good,  we will use the model a next time too, as it proved to be useful.    Now we have the normal answer to a fundamental question asked for long time:  'why do the laws of nature exist?' or 'Why the world has an order?'    As it results from MDT, we reflect the external reality based on symbolic  models. These symbolic models need to be logical in order to be stable. If a  symbolic model associated to external reality will not reflect it correctly,  we will build a new model.    Example: The external reality can change due to the movement of some objects.  Then we will build a symbolic model containing the term 'velocity'. This  symbolic model will make good predictions provided the objects move at a  constant velocity. If the velocity is not constant, the model will not reflect  correctly the external reality. Then we will build a new symbolic model,  introducing a new element called 'acceleration'. This model will make correct  prediction for the objects that move at variable velocities as well. Thus, by  building of adequate models, the external reality is reflected by stable  models.    It is very easy to confuse the external reality with its 'image' generated by  a stable symbolic model.    As we know, we have no direct acces to external reality. We perceive it based  on some associated models. Thus, as a conclusion, the impresion that nature is  a structure based on stable laws and order comes from the fact that we reflect  the external reality based on logical and stable symbolic models.      ETA 4: General Communication Language (GCL), dictionary    GCL is the first symbolic model generated by the human brain. At the  beginning, only its spoken form existed, later it appeared as a written  language too.    As the purpose of the construction of models is to predict the evolution of  external reality, GCL was always associated directly or indirectly with  external reality.    GCL is a very special symbolic model. It is used both for general  communication and for building other more precise symbolic models.    Examples of developed languages included in GCL: diplomatic language, juridic  language, logical and mathematical language, languages based on gestures and  signs, computer languages.    GCL can be used to build symbolic models that are associated to external  reality, e.g. the positive sciences.    It is supposed that GCL occurs by spontaneous interaction between people but  this is an abnormal mode of occurence. It is not clear to me that a language  can start from scratch, but let's suppose so. The abnormal mode of occurence  is associated with another aspect. The language for any device used to process  information (as the brain is) is made of a collection of terms and relations.  Any element/relation of the symbolic model (language) must be associated with  a component/function of the hardware. That is, the hardware must be known  before the language is built. This is the normal situation, e.g. when a  computer, which has no associated programs, has to be used.    But, as it is believed, the language used by the brain appeared without  knowing the hardware. The main consequence is that all the words, which have  to be associated with the basic feature of the hardware, have no precise  definition.    Thus, we find in dictionaries what I call \"external definition\" of the words.  That is, such definitions are not based on the hardware. MDT as a theory  associated with the hardware, generates \"internal definitions\" of the words.  Some such definitions will be given below.    Dictionary of internal definitions for some words:    1. To believe: there is an incomplete (unstable) model. Such a model could  become stable (harmonic/logic) if some artificial elements/relations are  included (artificial means that something is not generated by the interaction  with the external reality). After such changes, the model becomes stable. Any  truth generated by such a model must be associated with the word \"to believe\".  Also, the artificial changes must be specified before.    2. To know: there is a stable model (harmonic/logic) which is integrated in a  stable structure of models. Any truth generated by such a model can be  associated with \"to know\". I want to emphasize that from this does not result  in any way that the truth is correct, when compared to the external reality.  \"To know\" means just that the whole structure of models of the brain supports  that truth, and nothing more! As one can see, \"to know\" is associated only to  the structure of models, and not to the external reality.    3. As I know: there are some models which support a truth but some other  related models are not good enough to support that truth.    4. Correct, to be correct: this term has at least two meanings.  4a. There is a model generating a prediction in association with the external  reality. This prediction is compared with IR. If the result is positive, then  the truth is correct.  4b. There is a stable structure of models. Such a structure has already  predicted a large number of correct (4a) truths. In such a situation, any  truth generated by the structure is considered to be correct (see also the  definition of the term \"to know\").    To be correct based on definition 4a means to make an experiment (any  comparison between a prediction and IR is called \"experiment\"). There are a  very limited situation when an experiment can or may be done (e.g. if the  problem is to verify if a bridge will survive or not in case of an earthquake,  then such a problem cannot be solved based on an experiment).    Let's analize now a little the word \"wrong\". If a model generates wrong  predictions based on IR, this does not mean usually that the model is wrong.  This word is usually associated to a model, which is not suitable to a  specific external reality.    For instance Newton's Mechanics is wrong for objects, which travel at a speed  comparable with the speed of light, but is correct at low speed.    5. To understand: there is an incomplete model and there is an IR (from  external reality or from other models). The model is selfimproving based on  that IR. The term \"understand\" is used when a model is improved in such a way.    6. To imagine: is the main term associated to any operation on image models.    7. To think: it is the main term associated to any operation on symbolic  models.    For human beings, usually, the symbolic models are mixed with image models but  when \"to think\" is used, the general frame continues to be a symbolic one.    8. Intelligence: is the facility to make and operate a long-range model. There  is a kind of intelligence based on image models (human and animal) and one  based on symbolic models (human only).    9. To represent: there is a complex model, which is too big to be used as a  whole. Such a model can be associated to a simplified model, which on its turn  is associated only to a section of the main model. Such a model represents the  main model on the restricted domain. We should never forget that a  representation model is based on the main model, and the main model only is  fully associated to the external reality.    10. Emotion: this is a temporary state which occurs when a new external  reality appears, and no suitable short-range model is available. Emotion is  associated ONLY to a lack of a suitable SHORT-RANGE model. In such a situation  the PSM is activate. But the activated PSM does not consider this external  reality as a dangerous situation. Even so, it builds a suitable element. Such  an element is self-developing to understand the new external reality. The  emotion starts when PSM is activated, and disappears when a new suitable  short-range model is activated. Because emotion is associated with the  activation of PSM, in an emotional status, the conciousness disappears or is  at least attenuated.    The brain can predict the possiblity that an emotional status occurs.  Sometimes such status can be prevented by a suitable WBAM, built in advance.  That is, a ZM will build a WBAM based on the available information about a  future new external reality. ZM will activate that WBAM when the new external  reality occurs (see also the general theory).    We already emphasized that emotions are associated to the lack of a short-  range model, when a new external reality occurs. The word \"angry\" can be  associated with the lack of a long-range model associated with a full section  of the external reality (for instance when a person lives in an environment,  which he/she doesn't fit in). In such a situation, the PSM is activated as  well, but it has no solution. In fact, PSM can't build a long-range model. A  long-range model is difficult to build, because it starts from a general model  which is not directly associated to a specified external reality. The lack of  a suitable long-range model means that many short-range models can become  unstable, due to a lack of correlation between them. Such a person has a  feeling that there is a problem, but he/she cannot identify it. Such a person  is in an angry-status. About the same considerations can be associated to the  word \"anxiety\". Here we can see a class of problems associated to the fact  that the words in common life are not associated to the hardware and so, the  external definitions are not"]]]
