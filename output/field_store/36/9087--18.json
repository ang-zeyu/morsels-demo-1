In large  cities they lay for some length of time with the intestines undrawn,  until the flavor of them diffuses itself all through the meat,  rendering it distasteful. In this case, it is safe, after taking out  the intestines, to rinse out in several waters, and in next to the  last water, add a teaspoonful of baking soda, say to a quart of water.  This process neutralizes all sourness, and helps to destroy all  unpleasant taste in the meat.    Poultry may be baked so that its wings and legs are soft and tender,  by being placed in a deep roasting pan with close cover, thereby  retaining the aroma and essences by absorption while confined. These  pans are a recent innovation, and are made double with a small opening  in the top for giving vent to the accumulation of steam and gases when  required. Roast meats of any kind can also be cooked in the same  manner, and it is a great improvement on the old plan.      ROAST TURKEY.    Select a young turkey; remove all the feathers carefully, singe it  over a burning newspaper on the top of the stove; then \"draw\" it  nicely, being very careful not to break any of the internal organs;  remove the crop carefully; cut off the head, and tie the neck close to  the body by drawing the skin over it. Now rinse the inside of the  turkey out with several waters, and in the next to the last, mix a  teaspoonful of baking soda; oftentimes the inside of a fowl is very  sour, especially if it is not freshly killed. Soda, being cleansing,  acts as a corrective, and destroys that unpleasant taste which we  frequently experience in the dressing when fowls have been killed for  some time. Now, after washing, wipe the turkey dry, inside and out,  with a clean cloth, rub the inside with some salt, then stuff the  breast and body with \"Dressing for Fowls.\" Then sew up the turkey  with a strong thread, tie the legs and wings to the body, rub it over  with a little soft butter, sprinkle over some salt and pepper, dredge  with a little flour; place it in a dripping-pan, pour in a cup of  boiling water, and set in the oven. Baste the turkey often, turning it  around occasionally so that every part will be uniformly baked. When  pierced with a fork and the liquid runs out perfectly clear, the bird  is done. If any part is likely to scorch, pin over it a piece of  buttered white paper. A fifteen pound turkey requires between three  and four hours to bake. Serve with cranberry sauce.    _Gravy for Turkey._--When you put the turkey in to roast, put the  neck, heart, liver and gizzard into a stewpan with a pint of water;  boil until they become quite tender; take them out of the water, chop  the heart and gizzard, mash the liver and throw away the neck; return  the chopped heart, gizzard and liver to the liquor in which they were  stewed; set it to one side, and when the turkey is done it should be  added to the gravy that dripped from the turkey, having first skimmed  off the fat from the surface of the dripping-pan; set it all over the  fire, boil three minutes and thicken with flour. It will not need  brown flour to color the gravy. The garnishes for turkey or chicken  are fried oysters, thin slices of ham, slices of lemon, fried  sausages, or force meat balls, also parsley.      DRESSING OR STUFFING FOR FOWLS.    For an eight or ten pound turkey, cut the brown crust from slices or  pieces of stale bread until you have as much as the inside of a pound  loaf; put it into a suitable dish and pour tepid water (not warm, for  that makes it heavy) over it; let it stand one minute, as it soaks  very quickly. Now take up a handful at a time and squeeze it hard and  dry with both hands, placing it, as you go along, in another dish;  this process makes it very light. When all is pressed dry, toss it all  up lightly through your fingers; now add pepper, salt--about a  teaspoonful--also a teaspoonful of powdered summer savory, the same  amount of sage, or the green herb minced fine; add half a cup of  melted butter, and a beaten egg, or not. Work thoroughly all together,  and it is ready for dressing either fowls, fish or meats. A little  chopped sausage in turkey dressing is considered by some an  improvement, when well incorporated with the other ingredients. For  geese and ducks the stuffing may be made the same as for turkey, with  the addition of a few slices of onion chopped fine.      OYSTER DRESSING OR STUFFING.    This is made with the same ingredients as the above, with the  exception of half a can of oysters drained and slightly chopped and  added to the rest. This is used mostly with boiled turkey and chicken,  and the remainder of the can of oysters used to make an oyster sauce  to be poured over the turkey when served; served generally in a  separate dish, to be dipped out as a person desires.    These recipes were obtained from an old colored cook, who was famous  for his fine dressing for fowls, fish and meats, and his advice was,  _always_ soak stale bread in _cold_ liquid, either milk or water, when  _used_ for stuffings or for puddings, as they were much lighter. Hot  liquid makes them heavy.      BOILED TURKEY.    Prepare as you would for baking or roasting; fill with an oyster  stuffing, made as the above. Tie the legs and wings close to the body,  place in salted boiling water with the breast downward; skim it often  and boil about two hours, but not till the skin breaks. Serve with  oyster or celery sauce. Boil a nicely pickled piece of salt pork, and  serve at table a thin slice to each plate. Some prefer bacon or ham  instead of pork.    Some roll the turkey in a cloth dipped in flour. If the liquor is to  be used afterwards for soup, the cloth imparts an unpleasant flavor.  The liquor can be saved and made into a nice soup for the next day's  dinner, by adding the same seasoning as for chicken soup.      TURKEY SCALLOP.    Pick the meat from the bones of cold turkey and chop it fine. Put a  layer of bread crumbs on the bottom of a buttered dish, moisten them  with a little milk, then put in a layer of turkey with some of the  filling, and cut small pieces of butter over the top; sprinkle with  pepper and salt; then another layer of bread crumbs, and so on until  the dish is nearly full; add a little hot water to the gravy left from  the turkey and pour over it; then take two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of  milk, one of melted butter, a little salt and cracker crumbs as much  as will make it thick enough to spread on with a knife; put bits of  butter over it, and cover with a plate. Bake three-quarters of an  hour. Ten minutes before serving, remove the plate and let it brown.      TURKEY HASHED.    Cut the remnants of turkey from a previous dinner into pieces of equal  size. Boil the bones in a quart of water, until the quart is reduced  to a pint; then take out the bones, and to the liquor in which they  were boiled add turkey gravy, if you have any, or white stock, or a  small piece of butter with salt and pepper; let the liquor thus  prepared boil up once; then put in the pieces of turkey, dredge in a  little flour, give it one boil-up, and serve in a hot dish.      TURKEY WARMED OVER.    Pieces of cold turkey or chicken may be warmed up with a little butter  in a frying pan; place it on a warm platter, surround it with pieces  of small thick slices of bread or biscuit halved, first dipping them  in hot salted water; then place the platter in a warm oven with the  door open. Have already made the following gravy to pour over all:--    Into the frying pan put a large spoonful of butter, one or two cupfuls  of milk, and any gravy that may be left over. Bring it to a boil; then  add sufficient flour, wet in a little cold milk or water, to make it  the consistency of cream. Season with salt, pepper and add a little of  the dark meat chopped _very_ fine. Let the sauce cook a few moments,  then pour over the biscuit and fowl. This will be found a really nice  dish.      BONED TURKEY.    Clean the fowl as usual. With a sharp and pointed knife, begin at the  extremity of the wing, and pass the knife down close to the bone,  cutting all the flesh from the bone, and preserving the skin whole;  run the knife down each side of the breast bone and up the legs,  keeping close to the bone; then split the back half way up, and draw  out the bones; fill the places whence the bones were taken with a  stuffing, restoring the fowl to its natural form, and sew up all the  incisions made in the skin. Lard with two or three rows of slips of  fat bacon on the top, basting often with salt and water, and a little  butter. Some like a glass of port wine in the gravy.    This is a difficult dish to attempt by any but skillful hands. Carve  across in slices, and serve with tomato sauce.      ROAST GOOSE.    The goose should not be more than eight months old, and the fatter the  more tender and juicy the meat. Stuff with the following mixture:  Three pints of bread crumbs, six ounces of butter, or part butter and  part salt pork, one teaspoonful each of sage, black pepper and salt,  one chopped onion. Do not stuff very full, and stitch openings firmly  together to keep flavor in and fat out. Place in a baking pan with a  little water, and baste frequently with salt and water (some add  vinegar); turn often so that the sides and back may be nicely browned.  Bake two hours or more; when done take from the pan, pour off the fat,  and to the brown gravy left add the chopped giblets which have  previously been stewed until tender, together with the water they were  boiled in; thicken with a little flour and butter rubbed together,  bring to a boil and serve, English style.      ROAST CHICKEN.    Pick and draw them, wash out well in two or three waters, adding a  little soda to the last but one to sweeten it, if there is doubt as to  its being fresh. Dry it well with a clean cloth, and fill the crop "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13937"],[0,"The Mysterious Rider (#16)"],[1,"meaner  an' wiser as he was hunted. His specialty got to be yearlings, an' the  ranchers all over rose up in arms against him. They hired all the old  hunters an' trappers in the country to kill him. No good! Old Lobo went  right on pullin' down yearlings. Every night he'd get one or more. An'  he was so cute an' so swift that he'd work on different ranches on  different nights. Finally he killed eleven yearlings for my boss on one  night. Eleven! Think of that. An' then I said to my boss, 'I reckon  you'd better let me go kill that gray butcher.' An' my boss laughed at  me. But he let me go. He'd have tried anythin'. I took a hunk of meat, a  blanket, my gun, an' a pair of snow-shoes, an' I set out on old Lobo's  tracks.... An', Miss Columbine, I _walked_ old Lobo to death in  the snow!\"    \"Why, how wonderful!\" exclaimed the girl, breathless and glowing with  interest. \"Oh, it seems a pity such a splendid brute should be killed.  Wild animals are cruel. I wish it were different.\"    \"Life is cruel, miss, an' I echo your wish,\" replied Wade, sadly.    \"You have had great experiences. Dad said to me, 'Collie, here at last  is a man who can tell you enough stories!'... But I don't believe you  ever could.\"    \"You like stories?\" asked Wade, curiously.    \"Love them. All kinds, but I like adventure best. _I_ should have been a  boy. Isn't it strange, I can't hurt anything myself or bear to see even  a steer slaughtered? But you can't tell too bloody and terrible stories  for me. Except I hate Indian stories. The very thought of Indians makes  me shudder.... Some day I'll tell you a story.\"    Wade could not find his tongue readily.    \"I must go now,\" she continued, and moved off the porch. Then she  hesitated, and turned with a smile that was wistful and impulsive. \"I--I  believe we'll be good friends.\"    \"Miss Columbine, we sure will, if I can live up to my part,\" replied  Wade.    Her smile deepened, even while her gaze grew unconsciously penetrating.  Wade felt how subtly they were drawn to each other. But she had no  inkling of that.    \"It takes two to make a bargain,\" she replied, seriously. \"I've my part.  Good-by.\"    Wade watched her lithe stride, and as she drew away the restraint he had  put upon himself loosened. When she disappeared his feeling burst all  bounds. Dragging the dogs inside, he closed the door. Then, like one  broken and spent, he fell face against the wall, with the hoarsely  whispered words, \"I'm thankin' God!\"        CHAPTER VI    September's glory of gold and red and purple began to fade with the  autumnal equinox. It rained enough to soak the frost-bitten leaves, and  then the mountain winds sent them flying and fluttering and scurrying to  carpet the dells and spot the pools in the brooks and color the trails.  When the weather cleared and the sun rose bright again many of the aspen  thickets were leafless and bare, and the willows showed stark against  the gray sage hills, and the vines had lost their fire. Hills and  valleys had sobered with subtle change that left them none the less  beautiful.    A mile or more down the road from White Slides, in a protected nook,  nestled two cabins belonging to a cattleman named Andrews, who had  formerly worked for Belllounds and had recently gone into the stock  business for himself. He had a rather young wife, and several children,  and a brother who rode for him. These people were the only neighbors of  Belllounds for some ten miles on the road toward Kremmling.    Columbine liked Mrs. Andrews and often rode or walked down there for a  little visit and a chat with her friend and a romp with the children.    Toward the end of September Columbine found herself combating a strong  desire to go down to the Andrews ranch and try to learn some news about  Wilson Moore. If anything had been heard at White Slides it certainly  had not been told her. Jack Belllounds had ridden to Kremmling and back  in one day, but Columbine would have endured much before asking him for  information.    She did, however, inquire of the freighter who hauled Belllounds's  supplies, and the answer she got was awkwardly evasive. That nettled  Columbine. Also it raised a suspicion which she strove to subdue.  Finally it seemed apparent that Wilson Moore's name was not to be  mentioned to her.    First, in her growing resentment, she had an impulse to go to her new  friend, the hunter Wade, and confide in him not only her longing to  learn about Wilson, but also other matters that were growing daily more  burdensome. How strange for her to feel that in some way Jack Belllounds  had come between her and the old man she loved and called father!  Columbine had not divined that until lately. She felt it now in the fact  that she no longer sought the rancher as she used to, and he had  apparently avoided her. But then, Columbine reflected, she might be  entirely wrong, for when Belllounds did meet her at meal-times, or  anywhere, he seemed just as affectionate as of old. Still he was not the  same man. A chill, an atmosphere of shadow, had pervaded the once  wholesome ranch. And so, feeling not yet well enough acquainted with  Wade to confide so intimately in him, she stifled her impulses and  resolved to make some effort herself to find out what she wanted  to know.    As luck would have it, when she started out to walk down to the Andrews  ranch she encountered Jack Belllounds.    \"Where are you going?\" he inquired, inquisitively.    \"I'm going to see Mrs. Andrews,\" she replied.    \"No, you're not!\" he declared, quickly, with a flash.    Columbine felt a queer sensation deep within her, a hot little gathering  that seemed foreign to her physical being, and ready to burst out. Of  late it had stirred in her at words or acts of Jack Belllounds. She  gazed steadily at him, and he returned her look with interest. What he  was thinking she had no idea of, but for herself it was a recurrence and  an emphasis of the fact that she seemed growing farther away from this  young man she had to marry. The weeks since his arrival had been the  most worrisome she could remember.    \"I _am_ going,\" she replied, slowly.    \"No!\" he replied, violently. \"I won't have you running off down there  to--to gossip with that Andrews woman.\"    \"Oh, _you_ won't?\" inquired Columbine, very quietly. How little he  understood her!    \"That's what I said.\"    \"You're not my boss yet, Mister Jack Belllounds,\" she flashed, her  spirit rising. He could irritate her as no one else.    \"I soon will be. And what's a matter of a week or a month?\" he went on,  calming down a little.    \"I've promised, yes,\" she said, feeling her face blanch, \"and I keep my  promises.... But I didn't say when. If you talk like that to me it might  be a good many weeks--or--or months before I name the day.\"    \"_Columbine!_\" he cried, as she turned away. There was genuine distress  in his voice. Columbine felt again an assurance that had troubled her.  No matter how she was reacting to this new relation, it seemed a fearful  truth that Jack was really falling in love with her. This time she did  not soften.    \"I'll call dad to _make_ you stay home,\" he burst out again, his temper  rising.    Columbine wheeled as on a pivot.    \"If you do you've got less sense than I thought.\"    [Illustration: \"I know why you're going. It's to see that club-footed  cowboy Moore!... Don't let me catch you with him.\"]    Passion claimed him then.    \"I know why you're going. It's to see that club-footed cowboy Moore!...  Don't let me catch you with him!\"    Columbine turned her back upon Belllounds and swung away, every pulse in  her throbbing and smarting. She hurried on into the road. She wanted to  run, not to get out of sight or hearing, but to fly from something, she  knew not what.    \"Oh! it's more than his temper!\" she cried, hot tears in her eyes. \"He's  mean--_mean_--MEAN! What's the use of me denying that--any more--just  because I love dad?... My life will be wretched.... It _is_ wretched!\"    Her anger did not last long, nor did her resentment. She reproached  herself for the tart replies that had inflamed Jack. Never again would  she forget herself!    \"But he--he makes me furious,\" she cried, in sudden excuse for herself.  \"What did he say? 'That club-footed cowboy Moore'!... Oh, that was vile.  He's heard, then, that poor Wilson has a bad foot, perhaps permanently  crippled.... If it's true.... But why should he yell that he knew I  wanted to see Wilson?... I did _not!_ I _do_ not.... Oh, but I do,  I do!\"    And then Columbine was to learn straightway that she would forget  herself again, that she had forgotten, and that a sadder, stranger truth  was dawning upon her--she was discovering another Columbine within  herself, a wilful, passionate, different creature who would no longer  be denied.    Almost before Columbine realized that she had started upon the visit she  was within sight of the Andrews ranch. So swiftly had she walked! It  behooved her to hide such excitement as had dominated her. And to that  end she slowed her pace, trying to put her mind on other matters.    The children saw her first and rushed upon her, so that when she  reached the cabin door she could not well have been otherwise than rosy  and smiling. Mrs. Andrews, ruddy and strong, looked the pioneer  rancher's hard-working wife. Her face brightened at the advent of  Columbine, and showed a little surprise and curiosity as well.    \"Laws, but it's good to see you, Columbine,\" was her greeting. \"You  'ain't been here for a long spell.\"    \"I've been coming, but just put it off,\" replied Columbine.    And so, after the manner of women neighbors, they began to talk of the  fall round-up, and the near approach of winter with its loneliness, and  the children, all of which naturally led to more personal and  interesting topics.    \"An' is it so, Columbine, that you're to marry Jack Belllounds?\" asked  Mrs. Andrews, presently.    \"Yes, I guess it is,\""]]]
