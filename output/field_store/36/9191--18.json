All  together this publication, parading in the gown of science, is  contradicted by our own presentation of the facts; it may be mentioned  also that this work contains in part positive untruths. Thus it states  on Page 70 (retranslation):         No diplomatic pressure whatever was exerted [by Germany] on Vienna,       which, under the protection of Berlin, was permitted to do with       Servia as she liked.         Grey's own words contradict this assertion.      [03] In the aforementioned book of the Oxford historians there is  stated on Page 69 (retranslation):         This mediation [namely, Grey's mediation proposition] had already       been accepted, by Russia on July 25th.    We have shown in the foregoing that the Russian Government did in no  manner subscribe to the conference plan in binding terms. As an  additional proof, a part of Buchanan's dispatch of the 25th may be  mentioned:         He [Sazonof] would like to see the question placed on international       footing.... If Servia should appeal to the powers, Russia would be       quite ready to stand aside and leave the question in the hands of       England, France, Germany, and Italy. It would be possible in his       opinion that Servia might propose to submit the question to       arbitration.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 17.)    Hence, not if England, but only if Servia would propose arbitration by  the powers, Mr. Sazonof was willing! The most amusing part of this is  that the Russian Minister himself considers such a proposition on the  part of Servia merely as \"possible\"; evidently it would have appeared as  a great condescension on the part of the Government at Belgrade if it,  standing on the same basis as Austria-Hungary, would appear before a  European tribunal! For us there is no additional proof necessary that a  mediation conference, which for Austria was not acceptable even when  proposed by England, would be unthinkable if the move for such came from  Servia. In expressing such an idea. Mr. Sazonof proved that it was his  intention to bring war about.      [04] The book, which appeared at Oxford, \"Why We Are at War,\" mentioned  previously states on Page 27 (retranslation):         That such a plan [the marching through Luxemburg and Belgium] had       been taken into consideration by the Germans has been known in       England generally for several years; and it has also been generally       accepted that the attempt to carry out this plan would bring about       the active resistance of the British armed forces: one assumed that       these would be given the task of assisting the left wing of the       French, which would have to resist German advance from Belgian       territory.                 *       *       *       *       *          \"Truth About Germany\"                 *       *       *       *       *      Attested by Thirty-four German Dignitaries.[05]      Board of Editors.

Only a few  weeks ago all of us were peacefully following our several vocations. The  peasant was gathering in this Summer's plentiful crop, the factory hand  was working with accustomed vigor. Not one human being among us dreamed  of war. We are a nation that wishes to lead a quiet and industrious  life. This need hardly be stated to you Americans. You, of all others,  know the temper of the German who lives within your gates. Our love of  peace is so strong that it is not regarded by us in the light of a  virtue, we simply know it to be an inborn and integral portion of  ourselves. Since the foundation of the German Empire in the year 1871,  we, living in the centre of Europe, have given an example of  tranquillity and peace, never once seeking to profit by any momentary  difficulties of our neighbors. Our commercial extension, our financial  rise in the world, is far removed from any love of adventure, it is the  fruit of painstaking and plodding labor.    We are not credited with this temper, because we are insufficiently  known. Our situation and our way of thinking are not easily grasped.    Every one is aware that we have produced great philosophers and poets,  we have preached the gospel of humanity with impassioned zeal. America  fully appreciates Goethe and Kant, looks upon them as cornerstones of  elevated culture. Do you really believe that we have changed our  natures, that our souls can be satisfied with military drill and servile  obedience? We are soldiers because we have to be soldiers, because  otherwise Germany and German civilization would be swept away from the  face of the earth. It has cost us long and weary struggles to attain our  independence, and we know full well that, in order to preserve it, we  must not content ourselves with building schools and factories, we must  look to our garrisons and forts. We and all our soldiers have remained,  however, the same lovers of music and lovers of exalted thought. We have  retained our old devotion to all peaceable sciences and arts; as all the  world knows, we work in the foremost rank of all those who strive to  advance the exchange of commodities, who further useful technical  knowledge. But we have been forced to become a nation of soldiers in  order to be free. And we are bound to follow our Kaiser, because he  symbolizes and represents the unity of our nation. Today, knowing no  distinction of party, no difference of opinion, we rally around him,  willing to shed the last drop of our blood. For though it takes a great  deal to rouse us Germans, when once aroused our feelings run deep and  strong. Every one is filled with this passion, with the soldier's ardor.  But when the waters of the deluge shall have subsided, gladly will we  return to the plow and to the anvil.    It deeply distresses us to see two highly civilized nations, England and  France, joining the onslaught of autocratic Russia. That this could  happen will remain one of the anomalies of history. It is not our fault;  we firmly believed in the desirability of the great nations working  together, we peaceably came to terms with France and England in sundry  difficult African questions. There was no cause for war between Western  Europe and us, no reason why Western Europe should feel itself  constrained to further the power of the Czar.    The Czar, as an individual, is most certainly not the instigator of the  unspeakable horrors that are now inundating Europe. But he bears before  God and posterity the responsibility of having allowed himself to be  terrorized by an unscrupulous military clique.    Ever since the weight of the crown has pressed upon him, he has been the  tool of others. He did not desire the brutalities in Finland, he did not  approve of the iniquities of the Jewish pogroms, but his hand was too  weak to stop the fury of the reactionary party. Why would he not permit  Austria to pacify her southern frontier? It was inconceivable that  Austria should calmly see her heir apparent murdered. How could she? All  the nationalities under her rule realized the impossibility of tamely  allowing Servia's only too evident and successful intrigues to be  carried on under her very eyes. The Austrians could not allow their  venerable and sorely stricken monarch to be wounded and insulted any  longer. This reasonable and honorable sentiment on the part of Austria  has caused Russia to put itself forward as the patron of Servia, as the  enemy of European thought and civilization.    Russia has an important mission to fulfill in its own country and in  Asia. It would do better in its own interest to leave the rest of the  world in peace. But the die is cast, and all nations must decide whether  they wish to further us by sentiments and by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#16)"],[1,"of the most  minutely laboured panegyrics of the work itself, that ever the blindest  idolater of some ancient classic paid to the object of his frenetic  imagination. In several places there, he contrives to repeat the  striking parts of the narrative which display the fertility of his  imagination to great advantage. To the author's own edition of his  _Clarissa_ is appended an _alphabetical arrangement_ of the sentiments  dispersed throughout the work; and such was the fondness that dictated  this voluminous arrangement, that such trivial aphorisms as, \"habits are  not easily changed,\" \"men are known by their companions,\" &c., seem  alike to be the object of their author's admiration. This collection of  sentiments, said indeed to have been sent to him anonymously, is curious  and useful, and shows the value of the work, by the extensive grasp of  that mind which could think so justly on such numerous topics. And in  his third and final labour, to each volume of _Sir Charles Grandison_ is  not only prefixed a complete _index_, with as much exactness as if it  were a History of England, but there is also appended a _list_ of the  _similes_ and allusions in the volume; some of which do not exceed  _three_ or _four_ in nearly as many hundred pages.    Literary history does not record a more singular example of that  self-delight which an author has felt on a revision of his works. It was  this intense pleasure which produced his voluminous labours. It must be  confessed there are readers deficient in that sort of genius which makes  the mind of Richardson so fertile and prodigal.          INFLUENCE OF A NAME.          What's in a NAME? That which we call a rose,      By any other name would smell as sweet.    Names, by an involuntary suggestion, produce an extraordinary illusion.  Favour or disappointment has been often conceded as the _name_ of the  claimant has affected us; and the accidental affinity or coincidence of  a _name_, connected with ridicule or hatred, with pleasure or disgust,  has operated like magic. But the facts connected with this subject will  show how this prejudice has branched out.[20]    Sterne has touched on this unreasonable propensity of judging by  _names_, in his humorous account of the elder Mr. Shandy's system of  Christian names. And Wilkes has expressed, in Boswell's Life of Johnson,  all the influence of baptismal _names_, even in matters of poetry! He  said, \"The last city poet was _Elkanah_ Settle. There is _something_ in  _names_ which one cannot help feeling. Now _Elkanah_ Settle sounds so  queer, who can expect much from _that name_? We should have no  hesitation to give it for _John Dryden_ in preference to _Elkanah  Settle_, from the _names only_, without knowing their different merits.\"    A lively critic noticing some American poets, says \"There is or was a  Mr. Dwight who wrote a poem in the shape of an epic; and his baptismal  name was _Timothy_;\" and involuntarily we infer the sort of epic that a  _Timothy_ must write. Sterne humorously exhorts all godfathers not \"to  Nicodemus a man into nothing.\"    There is more truth in this observation than some may be inclined to  allow; and that it affects mankind strongly, all ages and all climates  may be called on to testify. Even in the barbarous age of Louis XI.,  they felt a delicacy respecting _names_, which produced an ordinance  from his majesty. The king's barber was named _Olivier le Diable_. At  first the king allowed him to got rid of the offensive part by changing  it to _Le Malin_; but the improvement was not happy, and for a third  time he was called _Le Mauvais_. Even this did not answer his purpose;  and as he was a great racer, he finally had his majesty's ordinance to  be called _Le Dain_, under penalty of law if any one should call him _Le  Diable_, _Le Malin_, or _Le Mauvais_. According to Platina, Sergius the  Second was the first pope who changed his name in ascending the papal  throne; because his proper name was _Hog's-mouth_, very unsuitable with  the pomp of the tiara. The ancients felt the same fastidiousness; and  among the Romans, those who were called to the equestrian order, having  low and vulgar _names_, were new named on the occasion, lest the former  one should disgrace the dignity.[21]    When _Burlier_, a French wit, was chosen for the preceptor of Colbert's  son, he felt his _name_ was so uncongenial to his new profession, that  he assumed the more splendid one of _D'Aucour_, by which he is now  known. Madame _Gomez_ had married a person named _Bonhomme_; but she  would never exchange her nobler Spanish name to prefix her married one  to her romances, which indicated too much of meek humility. _Guez_ (a  beggar) is a French writer of great pomp of style; but he felt such  extreme delicacy at so low a name, that to give some authority to the  splendour of his diction, he assumed the name of his estate, and is well  known as _Balzac_. A French poet of the name of Theophile _Viaut_,  finding that his surname pronounced like _veau_ (calf), exposed him to  the infinite jests of the minor wits, silently dropped it, by retaining  the more poetical appellation of _Theophile_. Various literary artifices  have been employed by some who, still preserving a natural attachment to  the names of their fathers, yet blushing at the same time for their  meanness, have in their Latin works attempted to obviate the ridicule  which they provoked. One _Gaucher_ (left-handed) borrowed the name of  _Scevola_, because Scevola, having burnt his right arm, became  consequently left-handed. Thus also one _De la Borgne_ (one-eyed) called  himself _Strabo_; _De Charpentier_ took that of _Fabricius_; _De Valet_  translated his _Servilius_; and an unlucky gentleman, who bore the name  of _Du bout d'Homme,_ boldly assumed that of _Virulus_. Dorat, a French  poet, had for his real name _Disnemandi_, which, in the dialect of the  Limousins, signifies one who dines in the morning; that is, who has no  other dinner than his breakfast. This degrading name he changed to  _Dorat_, or gilded, a nickname which one of his ancestors had borne for  his fair tresses. But by changing his _name_, his feelings were not  entirely quieted, for unfortunately his daughter cherished an invincible  passion for a learned man, who unluckily was named _Goulu_; that is, a  shark, as gluttonous as a shark. Miss _Disnemandi_ felt naturally a  strong attraction for a _goulu_; and in spite of her father's  remonstrances, she once more renewed his sorrows in this alliance!    There are unfortunate names, which are very injurious to the cause in  which they are engaged; for instance, the Long Parliament in Cromwell's  time, called by derision the _Rump_, was headed by one _Barebones_, a  leather-seller. It was afterwards called by his unlucky name, which  served to heighten the ridicule cast over it by the nation.    Formerly a custom prevailed with learned men to change their names. They  showed at once their contempt for vulgar denominations and their  ingenious erudition. They christened themselves with Latin and Greek.  This disguising of names came, at length, to be considered to have a  political tendency, and so much alarmed Pope Paul the Second, that he  imprisoned several persons for their using certain affected names, and  some, indeed, which they could not give a reason why they assumed.  _Desiderius Erasmus_ was a name formed out of his family name _Gerard_,  which in Dutch signifies amiable; or GAR _all_, AERD _nature_. He first  changed it to a Latin word of much the same signification, _desiderius_,  which afterwards he refined into the Greek _Erasmus_, by which name he  is now known. The celebrated _Reuchlin_, which in German signifies  _smoke_, considered it more dignified to smoke in Greek by the name of  _Capnio_. An Italian physician of the name of _Senza Malizia_, prided  himself as much on his translating it into the Greek _Akakia_, as on the  works which he published under that name. One of the most amiable of the  reformers was originally named _Hertz Schwartz_ (black earth), which he  elegantly turned into the Greek name _Melancthon_. The vulgar name of a  great Italian poet was _Trapasso_; but when the learned Gravius resolved  to devote the youth to the muses, he gave him a mellifluous name, which  they have long known and cherished--_Metastasio_.    Harsh names will have, in spite of all our philosophy, a painful and  ludicrous effect on our ears and our associations: it is vexatious that  the softness of delicious vowels, or the ruggedness of inexorable  consonants, should at all be connected with a man's happiness, or even  have an influence on his fortune.    The actor _Macklin_ was softened down by taking in the first and last  syllables of the name of _Macklaughlin_, as _Malloch_ was polished to  _Mallet_; and even our sublime Milton, in a moment of humour and hatred  to the Scots, condescends to insinuate that their barbarous names are  symbolical of their natures,--and from a man of the name of _Mac  Collkittok_, he expects no mercy. Virgil, when young, formed a design of  a national poem, but was soon discouraged from proceeding, merely by the  roughness and asperity of the old Roman names, such as _Decius Mus_;  _Lucumo_; _Vibius Caudex_. The same thing has happened to a friend who  began an Epic on the subject of _Drake's_ discoveries; the name of the  hero often will produce a ludicrous effect, but one of the most unlucky  of his chief heroes must be _Thomas Doughty_! One of Blackmore's chief  heroes in his Alfred is named _Gunter_; a printer's erratum might have  been fatal to all his heroism; as it is, he makes a sorry appearance.  Metastasio found himself in the same situation. In one of his letters he  writes, \"The title of my new opera is _Il Re Pastor_. The chief incident  is the restitution of the kingdom of Sidon to the lawful heir: a prince  with such a _hypochondriac name_, that he would have"]]]
