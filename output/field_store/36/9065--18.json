To tell the troof, they didn't talk much like they does  now 'bout them sort of things. None of our niggers ever runned away and  we didn' know nuthin' 'bout no Norf twel long atter freedom come. We  visited round each other's cabins at night. I did hear tell 'bout the  patterollers. Folkses said effen they cotched niggers out at night they  'ud give 'em 'what Paddy give the drum'.    \"Jus' befo' freedom comed 'bout 50 Yankee sojers come through our  plantation and told us that the bull-whups and cow-hides was all dead  and buried. Them sojers jus' passed on in a hurry and didn' stop for a  meal or vittles or nuffin'. We didn't talk much 'bout Mr. Abbieham  Lincum endurin' slavery time kazen we was skeered of him atter the war  got started. I don't know nothin' 'bout Mr. Jef'son Davis, I don't  remember ever hearin' 'bout him. I is heard about Mr. Booker Washin'ton  and they do say he runned a moughty good school for niggers.    \"One mornin' Marster blowed the bugle his own self and called us all up  to the big 'ouse yard. He told us: 'You all jus' as free as I is. You  are free from under the taskmarster but you ain't free from labor. You  gotter labor and wuk hard effen you aims to live and eet and have  clothes to wear. You kin stay here and wuk for me, or you kin go  wharsomever you please.' He said he 'ud pay us what was right, and Lady,  hit's the troof, they didn't nary a nigger on our plantation leave our  marster then! I wukked on with Marster for 40 years atter the war!\"    James had no fear of the Ku Klux.    \"Right soon atter the war we saw plenty of Ku Kluxers but they never  bothered nobody on our plantation. They allus seemed to be havin' heaps  of fun. 'Course, they did have to straighten out some of them brash  young nigger bucks on some of the other farms round about. Mos' of the  niggers the Ku Kluxers got atter was'n on no farm, but was jus' roamin'  'round talkin' too much and makin' trouble. They had to take 'em in hand  two or three times befo' some of them fool free niggers could be larned  to behave theyselfs! But them Ku Kluxers kept on atter 'em twels't they  larned they jus got to be good effen they 'spects to stay round here.    \"Hit was about 40 years atter the war befo' many niggers 'gun to own  they own lan'. They didn' know nothin' 'bout tendin' to money business  when the war done ended and it take 'em a long time to larn how to buy  and sell and take care of what they makes.\" James shook his head sadly.  \"Ma'am, heaps of niggers ain't never larned nothin' 'bout them things  yit!    \"A long time atter the war I married Lizy Yerby. I didn' give Liza no  chanc't for to dress up. Jus' went and tuk her right outer the white  folkses' kitchen and married her at the church in her workin' clothes.  We had 13 chilluns but they ain't but two of 'em livin' now. Mos' of our  chilluns died babies. Endurin' slavery Mistess tuk care of all the  nigger babies borned on our plantations and looked atter they mammies  too, but atter freedom come heap of nigger babies died out.\"    James said he had two wives, both widows.    \"I married my second wife 37 years ago. To tell the troof, I don't  rightly know how many grandchilluns I got, kazen I ain't seed some of  'em for thirty years. My chilluns is off fum here and I wouldn' know to  save my life whar they is or what they does. My sister and brothers they  is done dead out what ain't gone off, I don't know for sho' whar none of  'em is now.\"    A sigh punctuated James' monologue, and his old face was shadowed by a  look of fear.    \"Now I gwine tell you the troof. Now that it's all over I don't find  life so good in my old age, as it was in slavery time when I was chillun  down on Marster's plantation. Then I didn' have to worry 'bout whar my  clothes and my somepin' to eat was comin' from or whar I was gwine to  sleep. Marster tuk keer of all that. Now I ain't able for to wuk and  make a livin' and hit's sho' moughty hard on this old nigger.\"          ALEC BOSTWICK  Ex-Slave--Age 76    [TR: Preceding page that would usually contain information regarding the  interview was marked 'Placeholder'.]      All of Uncle Alec Bostwick's people are dead and he lives in his tiny  home with a young Negress named Emma Vergal. It was a beautiful April  morning when his visitor arrived and while he was cordial enough he  seemed very reluctant about talking. However, as one question followed  another his interest gradually overcame his hesitancy and he began to  unfold his life's story.    \"I wuz born in Morgan County, an' I warn't mo' dan four year old when de  War ended so I don't ricollect nothin' 'bout slav'ry days. I don't know  much 'bout my ma, but her name was Martha an' pa's name was Jordan  Bostwick, I don't know whar dey come from. When I knowed nothin' I wuz  dar on de plantation. I had three brothers; George, John an' Reeje, an'  dey's all dead. I dis'members my sister's name. Dar warn't but one gal  an' she died when she wuz little.    \"Ain't much to tell 'bout what wuz done in de quarters. Slaves wuz  gyarded all de time jus' lak Niggers on de chain gang now. De overseer  always sot by wid a gun.    \"'Bout de beds, Nigger boys didn't pay no 'tention to sich as dat 'cause  all dey keered 'bout wuz a place to sleep but 'peers lak to me dey wuz  corded beds, made wid four high posties, put together wid iron pegs, an'  holes what you run de cords thoo', bored in de sides. De cords wuz made  out of b'ar grass woun' tight together. Dey put straw an' old quilts on  'em, an' called 'em beds.    \"Gran'pa Berry wuz too old to wuk in de field so he stayed 'roun' de  house an' piddled. He cut up wood, tended to de gyarden an' yard, an'  bottomed chairs. Gran'ma Liza done de cookin' an' nussed de white  folkses chilluns.    \"I wukked in de field 'long side da rest of de Niggers, totin' water an'  sich lak, wid de overseer dar all de time wid dat gun.    \"What you talkin' 'bout Miss? Us didn't have no money. Sho' us didn't.  Dey had to feed us an' plenty of it, 'cause us couldn't wuk if dey  didn't feed us good.    \"Us et cornbread, sweet 'tatoes, peas, home-made syrup an' sich lak. De  meat wuz fried sometimes, but mos' of de time it wuz biled wid de  greens. All de somethin' t'eat wuz cooked in de fireplace. Dey didn't  know what stoves wuz in dem days. Yes Ma'am, us went 'possum huntin' at  night, an' us had plenty 'possums too. Dey put sweet 'tatoes an' fat  meat roun' 'em, an' baked 'em in a oven what had eyes on each side of it  to put hooks in to take it off de fire wid.    \"No Ma'am, us didn't go fishin', or rabbit huntin' nuther. Us had to wuk  an' warn't no Nigger 'lowed to do no frolickin' lak dat in daytime. De  white folkses done all de fishin' an' daytime huntin'. I don't 'member  lakin' no sartin' somethin'. I wuz jus' too glad to git anythin'. Slaves  didn't have no gyardens of dey own. Old Marster had one big gyarden what  all de slaves et out of.    \"Tell you 'bout our clo'es: us wore home-made clo'es, pants an' shirts  made out of cotton in summer an' in de winter dey give us mo' home-made  clo'es only dey wuz made of wool. All de clawf wuz made on de loom right  dar on de plantation. Us wore de same things on Sunday what us did in de  week, no diffunt. Our shoes wuz jus' common brogans what dey made at  home. I ain't seed no socks 'til long atter de War. Co'se some folkses  mought a had 'em, but us didn't have none.    \"Marster Berry Bostwick an' Mist'ess Mary Bostwick, had a passel of  chillun, I don't 'member none 'cept young Marse John. De others drifted  off an' didn't come back, but young Marse John stayed on wid Old Marster  an' Old Mist'ess 'til dey died. Old Marster, he warn't good. Truth is de  light, an' he wuz one mean white man. Old Mist'ess wuz heaps better dan  him. Dar wuz 'bout 150 mens an' 75 'omans. I couldn't keep up wid de  chilluns. Dere wuz too many for me.    \"Marster an' Mist'ess lived in a big fine house, but de slave quarters  wuz made of logs, 'bout de size of box cyars wid two rooms.    \"'Bout dat overseer he wuz a mean man, if one ever lived. He got de  slaves up wid a gun at five o'clock an' wukked 'em 'til way atter  sundown, standin' right over 'em wid a gun all de time. If a Nigger  lagged or tuk his eyes off his wuk, right den an' dar he would make him  strip down his clo'es to his waist, an' he whup him wid a cat-o-nine  tails. Evvy lick dey struck him meant he wuz hit nine times, an' it  fotch da red evvy time it struck.    \"Oh! Yes Ma'am, dey had a cyar'iage driver, he didn't do much 'cept look  attar de hawses an' drive de white folkses 'roun'.    \"I done tole you 'bout dat overseer; all he done wuz sot 'roun' all day  wid a gun an' make de Niggers wuk. But I'se gwine tell you de trufe, he  sho' wuz poor white trash wid a house full of snotty-nose chilluns. Old  Marster tole him he wuz jus' lak a rabbit, he had so many chillun. I  means dis; if dem days comes back I hope de good Lord takes me fus'.    \"Dey had a house whar dey put de Niggers, what wuz called de gyard  house, an' us didn't know nothin' 'bout no jail dat day an' time. I seed  'em drive de Niggers by old Marster's place in droves takin' 'em to  Watkinsville. Morgan County, whar us lived, touched Oconee an' dat wuz  the nighes' town. One day I went wid old Marster to Watkinsville an' I  seed 'em sell Niggers on de block. I warn't sold. When I knowed nothin'  I wuz right whar I wuz at.    \"No Ma'am, dey warn't no schools for de Niggers in dem days. If a Nigger  wuz seed wid a paper, de white folks would pretty nigh knock his head  off him.    \"Us didn't have no church in de country for Niggers, an' dey went to  church wid deir white folkses, if dey went a tall. De white folks sot in  front, an' de Niggers sot in de back. All de time dat overseer wuz right  dar wid his gun.

It was near this hill that Tom intended to direct his projectiles, and  on the other side of it was another valley, running at right angles to  the one crossed by the dam.    As the foreman had said, if the waters (in case the dam burst) could be  turned into this transverse valley, the town could be saved.    \"But it would take considerable digging to open a way through that side  of the mountain, into the other valley,\" went on the man.    \"Yes,\" said Tom, and then he gave the matter no further thought, for  something came up that needed his attention.    \"Have you your explosive here?\" asked the foreman of the young inventor  the next day, when the weather showed signs of clearing.    \"Yes, some of it,\" said Tom. \"I have another supply in a safe place in  the village. I didn't want to bring too much here until the gun was to  be fired. I can easily get it if we need it. Jove!  I wish it would  clear. I want to get out in my Humming Bird, but I can't if this keeps  up.\" Tom had brought one of his speedy little airships with him to  Preston.    The following day the clouds broke a little, and on the next the sun  shone. Then the work on the gun went on apace. Tom and his friends were  delighted.    \"Well, I think we can try a shot tomorrow!\" announced Tom with delight  on the evening of the first clear day, when all hands had worked at  double time.    \"Bless my powder-horn!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"You don't mean it!\"    \"Yes, the gun is all in place,\" went on the young inventor. \"Of course,  it's only a temporary carriage, and not the disappearing one I shall  eventually use. But it will do. I'm going to try a shot tomorrow.  Everything is in readiness.\"    There came a knock on the door of the room Tom had fitted up as an  office in the old farmhouse.    \"Who is it?\" he asked.    \"Me--Koku,\" was the answer.    \"Well, what do you want, Koku?\"    \"Man here say him must see Master.\"    Tom and Ned looked at each other, suspicion in their eyes.    \"Maybe it's that spy again,\" whispered Ned.    \"If it is, we'll be ready for him,\" murmured his chum. \"Show him in,  Koku, and you come in too.\"    But the man who entered at once disarmed suspicion. He was evidently a  workman from the dam above, and his manner was strangely excited.    \"You folks had better get out of here!\" he exclaimed.    \"Why?\" asked Tom, wondering what was going to happen.    \"Why? Because our dam is going to burst within a few hours.  I've been  sent to warn the folks in town in time to let them take to the hills.  You'd better move your outfit. The dam can't last twenty-four hours  longer!\"          CHAPTER XVII    THE BURSTING DAM      \"Bless my fountain pen!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"You don't mean it!\"    \"I sure do!\" went on the man who had brought the startling news. \"And  the folks down below aren't going to have any more time than they need  to get out of the way. They'll have to lose some of their goods, I  reckon. But I thought I'd stop on my way down and warn you. You'd  better be getting a hustle on.\"    \"It's very kind of you,\" spoke Tom; \"but I don't fancy we are in any  danger.\"    \"No danger!\" cried the man. \"Say, when that water begins to sweep-down  here nothing on earth can stop it. That big gun of yours, heavy as it  is, will be swept away like a straw, I know--I saw the Johnstown flood!\"    \"But we're so high up on the side of the hill, that the water won't  come here,\" put in Ned. \"We had that all figured out when we heard the  dam was weak. We're not in any danger; do you think so, Tom?\"    \"Well, I hardly do, or I would not have set the gun where I did. Tell  me,\" he went on to the man, \"is there any way of opening the dam, to  let the water out gradually?\"    \"There is, but the openings are not enough with such a flood as this.  The engineers never counted on so much rain. It's beyond any they ever  had here. You see, there was a small creek that we dammed up to make  our lake. Some of the water from the spillway flows into that now, but  its channel won't hold a hundredth part of the flood if the dam goes  out.    \"You'd better move, I tell you. The dam is slowly weakening.  We've  done all we can to save it, but that's out of the question.  The only  thing to do is to run while there's time. We've tried to make  additional openings, but we daren't make any more, or the wall will be  so weakened that it will go out in less than twenty-four hours.    \"You've had your warning, now profit by it!\" he added. \"I'm going to  tell those poor souls down in the valley below. It will be tough on  them; but it can't be helped.\"    \"If the dam bursts and the water could only be turned over into the  transverse valley, this one would be safe,\" said Tom, in a low voice.    \"Yes, but it can't be done!\" the messenger exclaimed. \"Our engineers  thought of that, but it would take a week to open a channel, and there  isn't time. It can't be done!\"    \"Maybe it can,\" spoke Tom, softly, but no one asked him what he meant.    \"Well, I must be off,\" the man went on. \"I've done my duty in warning  you.\"    \"Yes, you have,\" agreed Tom, \"and if any damage comes to us it will be  our own fault. But I don't believe there will.\"    The man hastened out, murmuring something about \"rash and foolhardy  people.\"    \"What are you going to do, Tom?\" asked Ned.    \"Stay right here.\"    \"But if the dam bursts?\"    \"It may not, but, if it does, we'll be safe. I have had a look at the  water, and there's no chance for it to rise here, even if the whole dam  went out at once, which is not likely. Don't worry.  We'll be all  right.\"    \"Bless my checkbook!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"But what about those poor  people in the valley?\"    \"They will have time to flee, and save their lives,\" spoke the young  inventor; \"but they may lose their homes. They can sue the water  company for damages, though. Now don't do any more worrying, but get to  bed, and be ready for the test tomorrow. And the first thing I do I'm  going to have a little flight in the Humming Bird to get my nerves in  trim. This long rain has gotten me in poor shape. Koku, you must be on  the alert tonight. I don't want anything to happen to my gun at the  last minute.\"    \"Me watch!\" exclaimed the giant, significantly, as he picked up a heavy  club.    \"Do you anticipate any trouble?\" asked Ned, anxiously.    \"No, but it's best to be on the safe side,\" answered Tom. \"Now let's  turn in.\"    Certainly the next day, bright and sunshiny as it broke, had in it  little of impending disaster. The weather was fine after the  long-continued rains, and the whole valley seemed peaceful and quiet.  At the far end could be seen the great dam, with water pouring over it  in a thin sheet, forming a small stream that trickled down the centre  of the valley, and to the town below.    But, through great pipes that led to the drinking system, though they  were unseen, thundered immense streams of solid water, reducing by as  much as the engineers were able the pressure on the concrete wall.    Tom and Ned, in the Humming Bird, took a flight out to the dam shortly  after breakfast, when the steel men were putting a few finishing  touches to the gun carriage, ready for the test that was to take place  about noon.    \"It doesn't look as though it would burst,\" observed Ned, as the  aircraft hovered over the big artificial lake.    \"No,\" agreed Tom. \"But I suppose the engineers want to be on the safe  side in case of damage suits. I want to take a look at the place where  the other valley comes up to this at right angles.\"    He steered his powerful little craft in that direction, and circled low  over the spot.    \"A bursting projectile, about where that big white stone is, would do  the trick,\" murmured Tom.    \"What trick?\" asked Ned, curiously.    \"Oh, I guess I was talking to myself,\" admitted Tom, with a laugh. \"I  may not have to do it, Ned.\"    \"Well, you're talking in riddles today, all right, Tom. When you get  ready to put me wise, please do.\"    \"I will. Now we'll get back, and fire our first long shot. I do hope I  make a record.\"    There was much to be done, in spite of the fact that the foreman of the  steel workers assured Tom that all was in readiness. It was some time  that afternoon when word was given for those who wished to retire to an  improvised bomb-proof. Word had previously been sent down the valley so  that no one, unless he was looking for trouble, need be in the vicinity  of the gun, nor near where the shots were to land.    Through powerful glasses Tom and Ned surveyed the distant mountain that  was to be the target. Several great squares of white cloth had been put  at different bare spots to make the finding of the range easy.    \"I guess we're ready now,\" announced the young inventor, a bit  nervously. \"Bring up the powder, Koku.\"    \"Me bring,\" exclaimed the giant, calmly, as he went to the bomb-proof  where the powerful explosive was kept.    The great projectile was in readiness to be slung into the breech by  means of the hoisting apparatus, for it weighed close to two tons. It  was carefully inserted under Tom's supervision.  It carried no bursting  charge, for Tom's first shot was merely to establish the extreme range  that his cannon would shoot.    \"Now the powder,\" called the young inventor. To avoid accidents Koku  handled this himself, the hoisting apparatus being dispensed with. Tom  figured out that five hundred pounds of his new, powerful explosive  would be about the right amount to use, and this quantity, divided into  several packages to make the handling easier, was quickly inserted in  the breech of the gun by Koku.    \"Bless my doormat!\" cried Mr. Damon, who stood near, looking nervously  on. \"Don't drop any of that.\"    \"Me no drop,\" was the answer.    Tom was busily engaged in figuring on a bit of paper, and Ned, who  looked over his shoulder, saw a complicated compilation that looked to  be a combination of geometry, algebra, differential"]]]
