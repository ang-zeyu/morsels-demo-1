He is a sociable, excellent man, and I am on very good terms with him.  All of us are on very good terms with him.    ADELAIDE.    I am glad to hear it.    BELLMAUS.    He sometimes goes a little too far, but he has the best heart in the  world.    ADELAIDE (_aside_). \"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings\" ye  shall hear the truth!    BELLMAUS.    His nature, you know, is a purely prosaic one; for poetry he has not  the least comprehension. ADELAIDE. Do you think so?    BELLMAUS.    Yes, he often bursts forth on the subject.    ADELAIDE (_rising_).    I thank you for your communication even if I cannot attach weight to  it, and I am glad to have met in you one of the editorial staff.  Journalists, I find, are dangerous people, and it is just as well to  secure their good will; although I, as an unimportant person, will try  never to furnish matter for a newspaper article. [_As_ BELLMAUS  _lingers._] Can I do anything more for you?    BELLMAUS (_with warmth_).    Yes, Miss Runeck, if you would be so good as to accept this copy of my  poems. They are poems of youth, to be sure, my first attempts, but I  count on your friendly indulgence.    [_Draws a gilt-edged book from his pocket, and hands it to her._]    ADELAIDE.    I thank you heartily, Mr. Bellmaus. Never before has a poet presented  me with his works. I shall read the beautiful book through in the  country, and, under my trees, shall rejoice that I have friends in  town who spare a thought for me too, when they represent beauty for  other people.    BELLMAUS (_fervently_).    Rest assured, Miss Runeck, that no poet will forget you, who has once  had the good fortune to make your acquaintance.    [_Exit with a deep bow._]    ADELAIDE.    This Mr. Schmock with the three glasses of punch is well worth  cultivating, I should say. Scarcely have I arrived in town when my  room turns into a regular business office, where editors and authors  ply their trade. I fear that is an omen.    [_Exit to the left._]    _It grows dark. The_ COLONEL _enters from the garden._    COLONEL (_slowly coming forward_).    I am glad that all is over between us. [_Stamping his foot._] I am  very glad! [_In a depressed tone._] I feel free and more relieved than  for a long time. I think I could actually sing! At this moment I am  the subject of conversation over all tea-cups, on all beer-benches.  Everywhere arguing and laughter: It serves him right, the old fool!  Damn! [_Enter_ CARL, _with lights and the newspaper_.] Who told you to  bring the lamp?    CARL.    Colonel, it is your hour for reading the newspaper. Here it is. [_Lays  it on the table_.]    COLONEL.    A low rabble, these gentlemen of the pen! Cowardly, malicious,  insidious in their anonymity. How this band will triumph now, and over  me! How they will laud their editor to the skies! There lies the  contemptible sheet! In it stands my defeat, trumpeted forth with full  cheeks, with scornful shrugs of the shoulders--away with it! [_Walks  up and down, looks at the newspaper on the ground, picking it up_.]  All the same I will drink out the dregs! [_Seats himself.]_ Here,  right in the beginning! [_Reading_.] \"Professor Oldendorf--majority of  two votes. This journal is bound to rejoice over the result.\"--I don't  doubt it!--\"But no less a matter for rejoicing was the electoral  contest which preceded it.\"--Naturally--\"It has probably never before  been the case that, as here, two men stood against each other who were  so closely united by years of friendship, both so distinguished by the  good will of their fellow-citizens. It was a knightly combat between  two friends, full of generosity, without malice, without jealousy; yes  doubtless, deep down in his heart, each harbored the hope that his  friend and opponent and not himself would be the victor\"--[_Lays down  the paper; wipes his brow_.] What sort of language is that? [_Reads_.]  \"and aside from some special party views, never did a man have greater  claims to victory than our honored opponent. What he, through his  upright, noble personality stands for among his wide circle of friends  and acquaintances, this is not the place to dwell upon. But the way in  which, by his active participation in all public spirited enterprises  of the town, he has given aid and counsel, is universally known and  will be realized by our fellow-citizens, especially today, with  heartfelt gratitude.\" [_Lays the paper aside_.] That is a vile style!  [_Reads on_.] \"By a very small majority of votes our town has decreed  to uphold the younger friend's political views in Parliament. But by  all parties today--so it is reported--addresses and deputations are  being prepared, not to extol the victor in the electoral contest, but  to express to his opponent the general reverence and respect of which  never a man was more worthy than he.\"--That is open assassination!  That is a fearful indiscretion of Oldendorf's, that is the revenge of  a journalist, so fine and pointed! Oh, it is just like him! No, it is  not like him! It is revolting, it is inhuman! What am I to do!  Deputations and addresses to me? To Oldendorf's friend? Bah, it is all  mere gossip, newspaper-babble that costs nothing but a few fine words!  The town knows nothing of these sentiments. It is blackguardism!    _Enter_ CARL.    CARL.    Letters from the local mail.    [_Lays them on the table._]    [_Exit_.]    COLONEL.    There is something up, here, too. I dread to open them. [_Breaks open  the first one_.] What the devil! A poem?--and to me? \"To our noble  opponent, the best man in town.\"--Signed? What is the signature?  \"B--aus!\" B--aus? I don't know it, it must be a pseudonym! [_Reads_.]  It seems to be exceedingly good poetry!--And what have we here?  [_Opens the second letter_.] \"To the benefactor of the poor, the  father of orphans.\" An address!--[_Reads_.] \"Veneration and  kindliness.\"--Signature: \"Many women and girls.\" The seal a P.P.--Good  God, what does it all mean? Have I gone mad? If these are really  voices from the town, and if that is the way people look on this day,  then I must confess men think better of me than I do of myself!    _Enter_ CARL.    CARL.    A number of gentlemen wish to speak to you, Colonel.    COLONEL.    What sort of gentlemen!    CARL.    They say: A deputation from the voters.    COLONEL.    Show them in. This confounded newspaper was right, after all.    _Enter_ PIEPENBRINK, KLEINMICHEL _and three other gentlemen. They  bow, the_ COLONEL _likewise_.    PIEPENBRINK (_solemnly_).    My Colonel: A number of voters have sent us as a deputation to you to  inform you on this special day that the whole town considers you a  most respectable and worthy man.    COLONEL (_stiffly_).    I am obliged for the good opinion.    PIEPENBRINK.    You have no reason to feel obliged. It is the truth. You are a man of  honor through and through, and it gives us pleasure to tell you so;  you cannot object to hearing this from your fellow-citizens.    COLONEL.    I always did consider myself a man of honor, gentlemen.    PIEPENBRINK.    There you were quite right. And you have proved your good principles,  too. On every occasion. In cases of poverty, of famine, of caring for  orphans, also at our shooting-club meeting--always when we citizens  enjoyed or needed a benevolent good man, you were among the first.  Always simple and loyal without arrogance or supercilious manners.  That's the reason why we universally love and honor you. (_Colonel  wipes his eyes_.) Today many of us gave their votes to the professor.  Some on account of politics, some because they know that he is your  close friend and possibly even your future son-in-law. COLONEL (_not  harshly_).    Sir--    PIEPENBRINK.    Nor did I myself vote for you.    COLONEL (_somewhat more excitedly_).    Sir--    PIEPENBRINK.    But for that very reason I come to you with the rest, and that is why  we tell you what the citizens think of you. And we hope that for long  years to come you will preserve to us your manly principles and  friendly heart as an honored, most respected gentleman and  fellow-citizen.    COLONEL (_without harshness_).    Why do you not say that to the professor, to the man that you have  chosen?    PIEPENBRINK.    He shall first deserve it in Parliament before the town thanks him.  But you _have_ deserved it of us, and therefore we come to you.    COLONEL (_heartily_).    I thank you, sir, for your kind words. They are very comforting to me  just now. May I ask your name?    PIEPENBRINK.    My name is Piepenbrink.    COLONEL (_morely coldly, but not impolitely_).    Ah, indeed, that is your name! (_With dignity._) I thank you,  gentlemen, for the friendly sentiment you have expressed, whether it  be that you render the true opinion of the town, or speak according to  the desire of individuals. I thank you, and shall go on doing what I  think is right.    [_Bows, so does the deputation; exit latter_.]    This, then, is that Piepenbrink, the close friend of his friend! But  the man's words were sensible and his whole demeanor honorable; it  cannot possibly be all rascality. Who knows! They are clever  intriguers; send into my house newspaper articles, letters, and these  good-natured people, to make me soft-hearted; act in public as my  friends, to make me confide again in their falseness! Yes, that is it.  It is a preconcerted plan! They will find they have miscalculated!    _Enter_ CARL.    CARL.    Dr. Bolz!    COLONEL.    I am at home to no one any longer!    CARL.    So I told the gentleman; but he insisted on speaking to you, saying  that he came in on an affair of honor.    COLONEL.    What? But Oldendorf won't be so insane--show him in here!    _Enter_ BOLZ.    BOLZ (_with dignity_).    Colonel, I come to make you an announcement which the honor of a third  person necessitates.    COLONEL.    I am prepared for it, and beg you not to prolong it unduly.    BOLZ.    No more than is requisite. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14472"],[0,"Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham (#16)"],[1,"have possessed the minds of the powers  that were in regard to any kind of quick transmission whatever, for in  the year 1673 it was actually proposed \"to suppress the public coaches  that ran within fifty or sixty miles of London,\" and to limit all the  other vehicles to a speed of \"thirty miles per day in summer, and  twenty-five in winter\"--for what might not be dreaded from such an  announcement as that \"that remarkable swift travelling coach, 'The Fly,'  would leave Birmingham on Mondays and reach London on the Thursdays  following.\" Prior to and about 1738, an occasional coach was put on the  road, but not as a regular and periodical conveyance, the fare to London  being 25 shillings, \"children on lap, and footmen behind, being charged  half-price.\" A \"Flying Coach\" commenced running direct to the Metropolis  on May 28th, 1745, and was evidently thought to be an event of some  importance, as it was advertised to do the distance in two days \"if the  roads permitted.\" In July, 1782, the same journey was accomplished in 14  hours, showing a great improvement in the arrangements of the road. The  first mail coaches for the conveyance of letters was started by Mr.  Palmer, of Bath, in 1784, the earliest noticed as passing through here  being on August 23, 1785, but the first direct mail from this town dates  only from May 25, 1812. In February, 1795, the Western mailcoaches were  delayed nearly a week together in consequence of a rapid thaw rendering  the roads impassable. In 1777 fifty-two coaches passed through here to  London and sixteen to Bristol every week. In 1829 at least 100 departed  from or passed through the town daily, 550 persons travelling between  here and London. In 1832 Mr. Lecount estimated the general results of  the road and canal traffic between here and London as follows:  Pessengers, 233,155; goods, 62,389 tons; parcels, 46,799; beasts,  50,839; sheep, 365,000; pigs, 15,364; the amount expended in cost of  transit being L1,338,217. In 1837 it was estimated that L6,789 was  received per week from coach passengers on the road from here to London,  L1,571 for parcels per coach, and L729 from persons posting along the  same roads; and that L8,120 was received for goods by canals and  waggons, not including iron, timber, cattle, minerals, or other goods at  low tonnage--L17,209 _per week_. There was, notwithstanding the large  number of coaches leaving here every day, no direct conveyance from  Birmingham to Edinburgh. The best and usual route was by Walsall,  Manchester, Preston, and Carlisle; distances and times being,  Manchester, 78-1/2 miles, 8 hours, fare, 14s.; Manchester to Carlisle,  118 miles, 12 hours 55 minutes by the mail, including stoppage of fifty  minutes at Preston for post office purposes, fare, L1 2s. 6d.; Carlisle  to Edinburgh, 95 miles, 9 hours 35 minutes, fare, 18s.; coachmen and  guards' fees about 15s.; all hotel charges, &c., were paid by the  passenger. Total distance, 291-1/2 miles; travelling time, 30-1/2 hours;  cost, L3 9s. 6d., in all. The mail coach which left the Albion reached  London in 10-1/2 hours, which would be reckoned as very good travelling,  even in these days. For some time after the introduction of railways,  the coaching interest was still of some account, for as late as 1840  there were 54 coaches and omnibuses running from here every 24 hours.--  There has been a kind of modern revival of the good old coaching days,  but it has not become popular in this part of the country, though quite  a summer feature on the Brighton Road. A four-in-hand, driven by the  Earl of Aylesford, was put on the road from here to Coventry, at latter  end of April, 1878; and another ran for part of the summer, in 1880, to  Leamington. The introduction of railways set many persons to work on the  making of \"steam coaches\" to travel on the highways. Captain Ogle coming  here on one of his own inventing September 8th, 1832, direct from  Oxford, having travelled at from ten to fourteen miles per hour. Our  local geniuses were not behindhand, and Messrs. Heaton Bros., and the  well-known Dr. Church brought out machines for the purpose. Both parties  started joint-stock companies to carry out their inventions, and in that  respect both parties succeeded, for such was the run for shares, that in  June, 1833, when Heatons' prospectus came out, offering to the public  2,000 L10 shares, no less than 3,000 were asked for in one day. There  was also a third company in the field, the \"London, Birmingham, and  Liverpool,\" with a nominal capital of L300,000; but none of them  prospered; for though they could construct the engines and the coaches,  they could not make receipts cover expenses. Heatons' ran theirs for  some little time to Wolverhampton and back, and even to the Lickey; the  Doctor came out every month with something new; and even the big Co.  managed to bring one carriage all the way from London (August 28th,  1835). Others besides Captain Ogle also came here on their iron horses,  and there was plenty of fun and interest for the lookers-on generally--  but no trade and no interest for the speculators. For steam coaches of  the present day, see \"_Tramways_.\"    ~Coal~ was not in common use much before 1625, and for a long time was  rather shunned by householders, more especially in the rural parts where  the black diamonds were looked upon as something altogether uncanny.  Prior to the opening of the first canal, the roads leading from the  Black Country daily presented the curious feature of an almost unending  procession of carts and waggons bringing the supplies needed by our  manufacturers, and high prices were the rule of the day. The first  boatload was brought in on November 6th, 1769, and soon after the price  of coal at the wharf was as low as 4d. per cwt.--See \"_Trades_.\"    ~Cobbett~ delivered a lecture on the Corn Laws, &c., at Beardsworth's  Repository, May 10 1830.    ~Cobden.~--There was a general closing of places of business here on  April 6, 1865, the day on which Richard Cobden was buried.    ~Cockfighting.~--_Aris's Gazette_ of December 26, 1780, announced in one  of its advertisements that \"the Annual Subscription Match of Cocks\"  would be fought at Duddeston Hall, commonly called \"Vauxhall,\" on the  New Year's day and day after.--The same paper printed an account of  another Cockfight, at Sutton, as late as April 17, 1875.    ~Coffeehouses.~--Coffee, which takes its name from the Abyssinian  province of Kaffa, was introduced into this country in the early part of  the 17th century, the first coffeehouse being opened in London in 1652.  Until very late years coffeehouses in provincial towns were more noted  for their stuffy untidiness than aught else, those of Birmingham not  excepted, but quite a change has come o'er the scene now, and with all  the brave glitter of paint and glaring gas they attempt to rival the  public-houses. The Birmingham Coffeehouse Company, Limited (originally  miscalled The Artizan's Clubhouse Company), which came into existence  March 27, 1877, with a capital of L20,000 in 10s. shares, has now near  upon a score of houses open, and their business is so successful that  very fair dividends are realised.    ~Coffins.~--Excluding textile fabrics and agricultural produce,  Birmingham supplies almost every article necessary for the comfort of  man's life, and it is therefore not surprising that some little  attention has been given to the construction of the \"casket\" which is to  enclose his remains when dead. Coffins of wood, stone, lead, &c., have  been known for centuries, but coffins of glass and coffins of brass must  be ranked amongst the curiosities of our later trades. Two of the latter  kind polished, lacquered, and decorated in a variety of ways, with  massive handles and emblazoned shields, were made here some few years  back for King Egbo Jack and another dark-skinned potentate of South  Africa. \"By particular request\" each of these coffins were provided with  four padlocks, two outside and two inside, though how to use the latter  must have been a puzzle even for a dead king. The Patent Metallic  Air-tight Coffin Co., whose name pretty accurately describes their  productions, in 1861 introduced hermetically-sealed coffins with plate  glass panels in the lid, exceedingly useful articles in case of  contagious diseases, &c., &c. The trade in coffin \"furniture\" seems to  have originated about 1760, when one ingenious \"Mole\" pushed it forward;  and among the list of patents taken out in 1796 by a local worthy there  is one for \"a patent coffin,\" though its particular speciality could not  have met with much approval, as although some thousands of bodies have  been removed from our various sepultures nothing curious or rarer than  rotten boards and old lead has been brought to light.    ~Coinage.~--So far had our patriotic forefathers proceeded in the art of  making money that about the middle of the last century it was estimated  over one half the copper coin in circulation was counterfeit, and that  nine-tenths thereof was manufactured in Birmingham, where 1,000  halfpennies could be had of the makers for 25s. Boulton's big pennies  were counterfeited by lead pennies faced with copper. One of these would  be a curiosity now. The bronze coinage was first issued December 1,  1860, and soon after Messrs. Ralph Heaton & Sons made 100 tons of bronze  coins for the Mint. They are distinguished by the letter \"H\" under the  date. The number, weight, and value of this issue were as follows:--        Tons                            Nominal Value.    62 or 9,595,245 pennies     ..  L25,396  17   1    28 or 5,504,382 halfpennies ..   11,469  10  11    10 or 3,884,446 farthings   ..    4,096   5   4    ----------------                 --------------    100 or 15,484,043 pieces    ..  L40,962  13   4      The same firm has had several similar contracts, the last being in hand  at the present time. The bronze is composed"]]]
