I their precious swords are gleaming,      And their banners wave in fight!    What! Thou fain would'st see, my darling,      Such a proud and noble knight?      \"Well, then, gaze on me, my dearest;      I am of that lordly host,    Kiss me! and you kiss a chosen      Champion of the Holy Ghost!\"      Silently the moon conceals her      Down behind the sombre trees,    And the lamp which lights our chamber      Flickers in the evening breeze.      But the starry eyes are beaming      Softly o'er the dimpled cheeks,    And the purple rose is glowing,      While the gentle maiden speaks.      \"Little people--fairy goblins--      Steal away our meat and bread;    In the chest it lies at evening,      In the morning it has fled.      \"From our milk the little people      Steal the cream and all the best;    Then they leave the dish uncovered,      And our cat drinks up the rest.      \"And the cat's a witch, I'm certain,      For by night, when storms arise,    Oft she seeks the haunted hill-top      Where the fallen tower lies.      \"There was once a splendid castle.      Home of joy and weapons bright,    Where there swept in stately pageant      Lady, page, and armed knight.      \"But a sorceress charmed the castle,      With its lords and ladies fair;    Now it is a lonely ruin,      And the owls are nesting there.      \"But my aunt hath often told me,      Could I speak the proper word,    In the proper place up yonder,      When the proper hour occurred,      \"I should see the ruins changing      Swiftly to a castle bright,    And again in stately dances      Dame and page and gallant knight.      \"He who speaks the word of power      Wins the castle for his own,    And the knight with drum and trumpet      Loud will hail him lord alone.\"      So the simple fairy pictures      From the little rose-mouth bloom,    And the gentle eyes are shedding      Star-blue lustre through the gloom.      Round my hand the little maiden      Winds her gold locks as she will,    Gives a name to every finger,      Kisses, smiles, and then is still.      All things in the silent chamber,      Seem at once familiar grown,    As if e'en the chairs and clothes-press,      Well of old to me were known.      Now the clock talks kindly, gravely,      And the cithern, as 'twould seem,    Of itself is faintly chiming,      And I sit as in a dream.      Now the proper hour is striking,      Here the charm should now be heard;    Child, how would'st thou be astonished,      Should I speak the magic word!      If I spoke that word, then fading      Night would thrill in fearful strife;    Trees and streams would roar together      As the mountains woke to life.      Ringing lutes and goblin ditties      From the clefted rock would sound,    Like a mad and merry spring-tide      Flowers grow forest-high around.      Thousand startling, wondrous flowers,      Leaves of vast and fabled form,    Strangely perfumed, wildly quivering,      As if thrilled with passion's storm.      In a crimson conflagration      Roses o'er the tumult rise;    Giant lilies, white as crystal,      Shoot like columns to the skies.      Great as suns, the stars above us      Gaze adown with burning glow;    Fill the lilies' cups gigantic      With their lights' abundant flow.      We ourselves, my little maiden,      Would be changed more than all;    Torchlight gleams o'er gold and satin      Round us merrily would fall.      Thou thyself would'st be the princess,      And this hut thy castle high;    Ladies, lords, and graceful pages      Would be dancing, singing by.      I, however, I have conquered      Thee, and all things, with the word!    Serfs and castle--lo! with trumpet      Loud they hail me as their Lord!    The sun rose. The mists flitted away like phantoms at the third crow of  the cock. Again I wandered up hill and down dale, while above me soared  the fair sun, ever lighting up new scenes of beauty. The Spirit of the  Mountain evidently favored me, well knowing that a \"poetical character\"  has it in his power to say many a fine thing of him, and on this morning  he let me see his Harz as it is not, most assuredly, seen by every one.  But the Harz also saw me as I am seen by few, and there were as costly  pearls on my eyelashes as on the grass of the valley. The morning dew of  love wet my cheeks; the rustling pines understood me; their twigs parted  and waved up and down, as if, like mute mortals, they would express  their joy with gestures of their hands, and from afar I heard beautiful  and mysterious chimes, like the sound of bells belonging to some hidden  forest church. People say that these sounds are caused by the  cattle-bells, which, in the Harz ring with remarkable clearness and  purity.    It was noon, according to the position of the sun, as I chanced upon  such a flock, and its shepherd, a friendly, light-haired young fellow,  told me that the great hill at whose base I stood was the old,  world-renowned Brocken. For many leagues around there is no house, and I  was glad enough when the young man invited me to share his meal. We sat  down to a _dejeuner dinatoire_, consisting of bread and cheese. The  sheep snatched up our crumbs, while pretty glossy heifers jumped around,  ringing their bells roguishly, and laughing at us with great merry eyes.  We made a royal meal, my host appearing to me every inch a king; and as  he is the only monarch who has ever given me bread, I will sing his  praises right royally:      Kingly is the herd-boy's calling,      On the knoll his throne is set,    O'er his hair the sunlight falling      Gilds a living coronet.      Red-marked sheep that bleat so loudly      Are his courtiers cross-bedight,    Calves that strut before him proudly      Seem each one a stalwart knight.      Goats are actors nimbly springing,      And the cows and warblers gay    With their bell and flute-notes ringing      Form the royal orchestra.      And whene'er the music hushes,      Soft the pine-tree murmurs creep;    Far away a cataract rushes--      Look, our noble king's asleep!      Meanwhile through the kingdom bounding      Rules the dog as minister,    Till his bark from cliffs rebounding      Echoes to the sleeper's ear.      Yawning syllables he utters--      \"Ruling is too hard a task.    Were I but at home,\" he mutters,      \"With my queen 'tis all I'd ask.      \"On her arm my head reposes      Free from care, how happily!    And her loving glance discloses      Kingdom wide enough for me.\"[53]    We took leave of each other in a friendly manner, and with a light heart  I began to ascend the mountain. I was soon welcomed by a grove of  stately firs, for which I entertain great respect in every regard, for  these trees have not found growing to be such an easy business, and  during the days of their youth it fared hard with them. The mountain is  here sprinkled with a great number of blocks of granite, and most of the  trees were obliged either to twine their roots over the stones, or to  split them in two, and thus laboriously to search for the soil from  which to draw their nourishment. Here and there stones lie on top of one  another, forming, as it were, a gate, and over all rise the trees,  twining their naked roots down over the stone portals, and only laying  hold of the soil when they reach its base, so that they appear to be  growing in the air; and yet, as they have forced their way up to that  startling height and grown into one with the rocks, they stand more  securely than their comfortable comrades, who are rooted in the tame  forest soil of the level country. So it is in life with those great men  who have strengthened and established themselves by resolutely  overcoming the obstacles and hindrances of their early years. Squirrels  climbed amid the fir-twigs, while, beneath, yellow deer were quietly  grazing. I cannot comprehend, when I see such a noble, lovable animal,  how educated and refined people can take pleasure in hunting and killing  it. Such a creature was once more merciful than man, and suckled the  pining Schmerzenreich of the holy Genofeva.

Are boiled in the same manner; quarter them when you send them to table.           *       *       *       *       *    SPROUTS AND YOUNG GREENS.    The receipt written for cabbages will answer as well for sprouts, only  they will be boiled enough in fifteen minutes.           *       *       *       *       *    ASPARAGUS.    Set a stew-pan with plenty of water on the fire, sprinkle a handful of  salt in it, let it boil, and skim it; then put in the asparagus prepared  thus: scrape all the stalks till they are perfectly clean; throw them  into a pan of cold water as you scrape them; when they are all done, tie  them in little bundles, of a quarter of a hundred each, with bass, if  you can get it, or tape; cut off the stalks at the bottom, that they may  be all of a length; when they are tender at the stalk, which will be in  from twenty to thirty minutes, they are done enough. Great care must be  taken to watch the exact time of their becoming tender; take them just  at that instant, and they will have their true flavour and colour; a  minute or two more boiling destroys both. While the asparagus is  boiling, toast a slice of a loaf of bread, about a half an inch thick;  brown it delicately on both sides; dip it lightly in the liquor the  asparagus was boiled in, and lay it in the middle of a dish; pour some  melted butter on the toast, and lay the asparagus upon it; let it  project beyond the asparagus, that the company may see there is a toast.  Do not pour butter over them, but send some in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    SEA-KALE.    Is tied up in bundles, and dressed in the same way as asparagus.           *       *       *       *       *    TO SCOLLOP TOMATOS.    Peel off the skin from large, full, ripe tomatos--put a layer in the  bottom of a deep dish, cover it well with bread grated fine; sprinkle on  pepper and salt, and lay some bits of butter over them--put another  layer of each, till the dish is full--let the top be covered with crumbs  and butter--bake it a nice brown.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STEW TOMATOS.    Take off the skin, and put them in a pan with salt, pepper, and a large  piece of butter--stew them till sufficiently dry.           *       *       *       *       *    CAULIFLOWER.    Choose those that are close and white, and of a middle size--trim off  the outside leaves, cut off the stalk flat at the bottom, let them lie  in salt and water an hour before you boil them. Put them in boiling  water, with a handful of salt in it--skim it well, and let it boil  slowly till done, which a small one will be in fifteen minutes, a large  one in twenty--and take it up the moment it is enough: a few minutes  longer boiling will spoil it.           *       *       *       *       *    RED BEET ROOTS.    Are not so much used as they deserve to be; they are dressed in the same  way as parsnips, only neither scraped nor cut till after they are  boiled; they will take from an hour and a half to three hours in  boiling, according to their size; to be sent to the table with salt  fish, boiled beef, &c. When young, small and juicy, it is a very good  variety, an excellent garnish, and easily converted into a very cheap  and pleasant pickle.           *       *       *       *       *    PARSNIPS.    Are to be cooked just in the same manner as carrots; they require more  or less time, according to their size; therefore match them in size, and  you must try them by thrusting a fork into them as they are in the  water; when this goes easily through, they are done enough: boil them  from an hour to two hours, according to their size and freshness.  Parsnips are sometimes sent up mashed in the same way as turnips.           *       *       *       *       *    CARROTS.    Let them be well washed and scraped--an hour is enough for young spring  carrots; grown carrots will take from an hour and a half to two hours  and a half. The best way to try if they are done enough, is to pierce  them with a fork.           *       *       *       *       *    TURNIPS.    Peel off half an inch of the stringy outside--full grown turnips will  take about an hour and a half gentle boiling; try them with a fork, and  when tender, take them up, and lay them on a sieve till the water is  thoroughly drained from them; send them up whole; to very young turnips,  leave about two inches of green top; the old ones are better when the  water is changed as directed for cabbage.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MASH TURNIPS.    When they are boiled quite tender, squeeze them as dry as possible--put  them into a sauce pan, mash them with a wooden spoon, and rub them  through a colander; add a little bit of butter, keep stirring them till  the butter is melted and well mixed with them, and they are ready for  table.           *       *       *       *       *    TURNIP TOPS.    Are the shoots which grow out, (in the spring.) from the old turnip  roots. Put them in cold water an hour before they are dressed; the more  water they are boiled in, the better they will look; if boiled in a  small quantity of water, they will taste bitter; when the water boils,  put in a small handful of salt, and then your vegetables; they are still  better boiled with bacon in the Virginia style: if fresh and young, they  will be done in about twenty minutes--drain them on the back of a sieve,  and put them under the bacon.           *       *       *       *       *    FRENCH BEANS.    Cut off the stalk end first, and then turn to the point and strip off  the strings; if not quite fresh, have a bowl of spring water, with a  little salt dissolved in it, standing before you; as the beans are  cleansed and trimmed, throw them in; when all are done, put them on the  fire in boiling water, with some salt in it; when they have boiled  fifteen or twenty minutes, take one out and taste it; as soon as they  are tender, take them up, and throw them into a colander to drain. To  send up the beans whole, when they are young, is much the best method,  and their delicate flavour and colour is much better preserved. When a  little more grown, they must be cut lengthwise in thin slices after  stringing; and for common tables, they are split, and divided across;  but those who are nice, do not use them at such a growth as to require  splitting.           *       *       *       *       *    ARTICHOKES.    Soak them in cold water, wash them well, then put them into plenty of  boiling water, with a handful of salt, and let them boil gently till  they are tender, which will take an hour and a half, or two hours: the  surest way to know when they are done enough, is to draw out a leaf;  trim them, and drain them on a sieve, and send up melted butter with  them, with some put into small cups, so that each guest may have one.           *       *       *       *       *    BROCOLI.    The kind which bears flowers around the joints of the stalks, must be  cut into convenient lengths for the dish; scrape the skin from the  stalk, and pick out any leaves or flowers that require to be removed;  tie it up in bunches, and boil it as asparagus; serve it up hot, with  melted butter poured over it. The brocoli that heads at the top like  cauliflowers, must be dressed in the same manner as the cauliflower.           *       *       *       *       *    PEAS.    To have them in perfection, they must be quite young, gathered early in  the morning, kept in a cool place, and not shelled until they are to be  dressed; put salt in the water, and when it boils, put in the peas; boil  them quick twenty or thirty minutes, according to their age; just before  they are taken up, add a little mint chopped very fine; drain all the  water from the peas, put in a bit of butter, and serve them up quite  hot.           *       *       *       *       *    PUREE OF TURNIPS.    Pare a dozen large turnips, slice them, and put them into a stew-pan,  with four ounces of butter and a little salt; set the pan over a  moderate fire, turn them often with a wooden spoon; when they look  white, add a ladle full of veal gravy, stew them till it becomes thick;  skim it, and pass it through a sieve; put the turnips in a dish, and  pour the gravy over them.           *       *       *       *       *    RAGOUT OF TURNIPS.    Peel as many small turnips as will fill a dish; put them into a stew pan  with some butter and a little sugar, set them over a hot stove, shake  them about, and turn them till they are a good brown; pour in half a  pint of rich high seasoned gravy; stew the turnips till tender, and  serve them with the gravy poured over them.           *       *       *       *       *    RAGOUT OF FRENCH BEANS, SNAPS, STRING BEANS.    Let them be young and fresh gathered, string them, and cut them in long  thin slices; throw them in boiling water for fifteen minutes; have ready  some well seasoned brown gravy, drain the water from the beans, put them  in the gravy, stew them a few minutes, and serve them garnished with  forcemeat balls; there must not be gravy enough to float the beans.           *       *       *       *       *    MAZAGAN BEANS.    This is the smallest and most delicate species of the Windsor bean.  Gather them in the morning, when they are full grown, but quite young,  and do not shell them till you are going to dress them. Put them into  boiling water, have a small bit of middling, (flitch,) of bacon, well  boiled--take the skin off, cover it with bread crumbs, and toast it; lay  this in the middle of the dish, drain all the water from the beans--put  a little butter with them, and pour them round the bacon. When the large  Windsor beans are used, it is best to put them into boiling water until  the skins will slip off, and then make them into a puree as directed for  turnips--they are very"]]]
