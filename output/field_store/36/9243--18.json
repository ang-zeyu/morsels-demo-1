Abraham virtually took  possession of it, and wandered over it with his flocks, building altars  at Shechem, Bethel, and Mamre, the places where God had revealed Himself  to him, treating as his equals the native chiefs, Abimelech of Gerar and  Melchizedek of Jerusalem,* and granting the valley of the Jordan as  a place of pasturage to his nephew Lot, whose flocks had increased  immensely.** His nomadic instinct having led him into Egypt, he was here  robbed of his wife by Pharaoh.***         * Cf. the meeting with Melchizedek after the victory over       the Elamites (_Gen_. xiv. 18-20) and the agreement with       Abimelech about the well (Gen. xxi. 22-34). The mention of       the covenant of Abraham with Abimelech belongs to the oldest       part of the national tradition, and is given to us in the       Jehovistic narrative. Many critics have questioned the       historical existence of Melchizedek, and believed that the       passage in which he is mentioned is merely a kind of parable       intended to show the head of the race paying tithe of the       spoil to the priest of the supreme God residing at       Jerusalem; the information, however, furnished by the Tel-       el-Amarna tablets about the ancient city of Jerusalem and       the character of its early kings have determined Sayce to       pronounce Melchizedek to be an historical personage.         ** _Gen._ xiii. 1-13. Lot has been sometimes connected of       late with the people called on the Egyptian monuments       Rotanu, or Lotanu, whom we shall have occasion to mention       frequently further on: he is supposed to have been their       eponymous hero. Lotan, which is the name of an Edomite clan,       (_Gen_. xxxvi. 20, 29), is a racial adjective, derived from       Lot.         *** _Gen._ xii. 9-20, xiii. 1. Abraham's visit to Egypt       reproduces the principal events of that of Jacob.    [Illustration: 093.jpg THE TRADITIONAL OAK OF ABRAHAM AT HEBRON]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph brought home by Lortet.      On his return he purchased the field of Ephron, near Kirjath-Arba, and  the cave of Machpelah, of which he made a burying-place for his family*  Kirjath-Arba, the Hebron of subsequent times, became from henceforward  his favourite dwelling-place, and he was residing there when the  Elamites invaded the valley of Siddim, and carried off Lot among their  prisoners.         * _Gen_. xiii. 18, xxiii. (Elohistic narrative). The tombs       of the patriarchs are believed by the Mohammedans to exist       to the present day in the cave which is situated within the       enclosure of the mosque at Hebron, and the tradition on       which this belief is based goes back to early Christian       times.    Abraham set out in pursuit of them, and succeeded in delivering his  nephew.* God (Jahveh) not only favoured him on every occasion, but  expressed His will to extend over Abraham's descendants His sheltering  protection. He made a covenant with him, enjoining the use on the  occasion of the mysterious rites employed among the nations when  effecting a treaty of peace. Abraham offered up as victims a heifer, a  goat, and a three-year-old ram, together with a turtle-dove and a young  pigeon; he cut the animals into pieces, and piling them in two heaps,  waited till the evening. \"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep  fell upon Abraham; and lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him,\"  and a voice from on high said to him: \"Know of a surety that thy seed  shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them;  and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation,  whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out  with great substance.... And it came to pass, that when the sun went  down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that  passed between those pieces.\" Jahveh sealed the covenant by consuming the  offering.         * _Gen._ xiv. 12-24. 2 Gen. xv., Jehovistic narrative.    Two less important figures fill the interval between the Divine  prediction of servitude and its accomplishment. The birth of one of  them, Isaac, was ascribed to the Divine intervention at a period when  Sarah had given up all hope of becoming a mother. Abraham was sitting  at his tent door in the heat of the day, when three men presented  themselves before him, whom he invited to repose under the oak while he  prepared to offer them hospitality. After their meal, he who seemed to  be the chief of the three promised to return within a year, when Sarah  should be blessed with the possession of a son. The announcement came  from Jahveh, but Sarah was ignorant of the fact, and laughed to herself  within the tent on hearing this amazing prediction; for she said, \"After  I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\" The child  was born, however, and was called Isaac, \"the laugher,\" in remembrance  of Sarah's mocking laugh.* There is a remarkable resemblance between his  life and that of his father.** Like Abraham he dwelt near Hebron,***  and departing thence wandered with his household round the wells of  Beersheba. Like him he was threatened with the loss of his wife.         * _Gen_. xviii. 1-16, according to the Jehovistic narrative.       _Gen_. xvii. 15-22 gives another account, in which the       Elohistic writer predicts the birth of Isaac in a different       way. The name of Isaac, \"the laugher,\" possibly abridged       from Isaak-el, \"he on whom God smiles,\" is explained in       three different ways: first, by the laugh of Abraham (ch.       xvii. 17); secondly, by that of Sarah (xviii. 12) when her       son's birth was foretold to her; and lastly, by the laughter       of those who made sport of the delayed maternity of Sarah       (xxi. 6).         ** Many critics see in the life of Isaac a colourless copy       of that of Abraham, while others, on the contrary, consider       that the primitive episodes belonged to the former, and that       the parallel portions of the two lives were borrowed from       the biography of the son to augment that of his father.         *** _Gen_. xxxv. 27, Elohistic narrative.    Like him, also, he renewed relations with Abimelech of Gerar.* He married  his relative Rebecca, the granddaughter of Nakhor and the sister of  Laban.** After twenty years of barrenness, his wife gave birth to twins,  Esau and Jacob, who contended with each other from their mother's womb,  and whose descendants kept up a perpetual feud. We know how Esau, under  the influence of his appetite, deprived himself of the privileges of  his birthright, and subsequently went forth to become the founder of  the Edomites. Jacob spent a portion of his youth in Padan-Aram; here he  served Laban for the hands of his cousins Rachel and Leah; then, owing  to the bad faith of his uncle, he left him secretly, after twenty  years' service, taking with him his wives and innumerable flocks. At  first he wandered aimlessly along the eastern bank of the Jordan,  where Jahveh revealed Himself to him in his troubles. Laban pursued and  overtook him, and, acknowledging his own injustice, pardoned him for  having taken flight. Jacob raised a heap of stones on the site of  their encounter, known at Mizpah to after-ages as the \"Stone of Witness  \"--G-al-Ed (Galeed).*** This having been accomplished, his difficulties  began with his brother Esau, who bore him no good will.         * _Gen._ xxvi. 1--31, Jehovistic narrative. In _Gen._ xxv.       11 an Elohistic interpolation makes Isaac also dwell in the       south, near to the \"Well of the Living One Who seeth me.\"         ** _Gen._ xxiv., where two narratives appear to have been       amalgamated; in the second of these, Abraham seems to have       played no part, and Eliezer apparently conducted Rebecca       direct to her husband Isaac (vers. 61-67).         *** _Gen._ xxxi. 45-54, where the writer evidently traces       the origin of the word Gilead to Gal-Ed. We gather from the       context that the narrative was connected with the cairn at       Mizpah which separated the Hebrew from the Aramaean speaking       peoples.    One night, at the ford of the Jabbok, when he had fallen behind his  companions, \"there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the  day,\" without prevailing against him. The stranger endeavoured to escape  before daybreak, but only succeeded in doing so at the cost of giving  Jacob his blessing. \"What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he  said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast  striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\" Jacob called the  place Peniel, \"for,\" said he, \"I have seen God face to face, and my life  is preserved.\" The hollow of his thigh was \"strained as he wrestled with  him,\" and he became permanently lame.* Immediately after the struggle  he met Esau, and endeavoured to appease him by his humility, building a  house for him, and providing booths for his cattle, so as to secure for  his descendants the possession of the land. From this circumstance the  place received the name of Succoth--the \"Booths \"--by which appellation  it was henceforth known. Another locality where Jahveh had met Jacob  while he was pitching his tents, derived from this fact the designation  of the \"Two Hosts\"--Mahanaim.** On the other side of the river, at  Shechem,*** at Bethel,**** and at Hebron, near to the burial-place of  his family, traces of him are everywhere to be found blent with those of  Abraham.         * _Gen._ xxxii. 22-32. This is the account of the Jehovistic       writer. The Elohist gives a different version of the       circumstances which led to the change of name from Jacob to       Israel; he places the scene at Bethel, and suggests no       precise etymology for the name Israel (_Gen._ xxxv. 9-15).         ** _Gen._"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#16)"],[1,"about any coldness  between the Pharaoh and his princely allies in Asia. The aged Amenothes  had, towards the end of his reign, asked the hand of Dushratta's  daughter in marriage, and the Mitannian king, highly flattered by the  request, saw his opportunity and took advantage of it in the interest  of his treasury. He discussed the amount of the dowry, demanded a  considerable sum of gold, and when the affair had been finally arranged  to his satisfaction, he despatched the princess to the banks of the  Nile. On her arrival she found her affianced husband was dead, or, at  all events, dying. Amenothes IV., however, stepped into his father's  place, and inherited his bride with his crown.    [Illustration: 100.jpg THE DOOR OF A TOMB AT TEL EL-AMARNA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.    The new king's relations with other foreign princes were no less  friendly; the chief of the Khati (Hittites) complimented him on his  accession, the King of Alasia wrote to him to express his earnest desire  for a continuance of peace between the two states. Burnaburiash of  Babylon had, it is true, hoped to obtain an Egyptian princess in  marriage for his son, and being disappointed, had endeavoured to pick a  quarrel over the value of the presents which had been sent him, together  with the notice of the accession of the new sovereign. But his kingdom  lay too far away to make his ill-will of much consequence, and his  complaints passed unheeded. In Coele-Syria and Phoenicia the situation  remained unchanged. The vassal cities were in a perpetual state  of disturbance, though not more so than in the past. Aziru, son of  Abdashirti, chief of the country of the Amorites, had always, even  during the lifetime of Amenothes III., been the most turbulent of  vassals. The smaller states of the Orontes and of the coast about Arvad  had been laid waste by his repeated incursions and troubled by his  intrigues. He had taken and pillaged twenty towns, among which were  Simyra, Sini, Irqata, and Qodshu, and he was already threatening Byblos,  Berytus, and Sidon. It was useless to complain of him, for he always  managed to exculpate himself to the royal messengers. Khai, Dudu,  Amenemaupit had in turn all pronounced him innocent. Pharaoh himself,  after citing him to appear in Egypt to give an explanation of his  conduct, had allowed himself to be won over by his fair speaking, and  had dismissed him uncondemned. Other princes, who lacked his cleverness  and power, tried to imitate him, and from north to south the whole of  Syria could only be compared to some great arena, in which fighting  was continually carried on between one tribe or town and another--Tyre  against Sidon, Sidon against Byblos, Jerusalem against Lachish. All  of them appealed to Khuniatonu, and endeavoured to enlist him on their  side. Their despatches arrived by scores, and the perusal of them at  the present day would lead us to imagine that Egypt had all but lost  her supremacy. The Egyptian ministers, however, were entirely unmoved  by them, and continued to refuse material support to any of the numerous  rivals, except in a few rare cases, where a too prolonged indifference  would have provoked an open revolt in some part of the country.    Khuniatonu died young, about the XVIIIth year of his reign.* He was  buried in the depths of a ravine in the mountain-side to the east of  the town, and his tomb remained unknown till within the last few years.  Although one of his daughters who died before her father had been  interred there, the place seems to have been entirely unprepared for the  reception of the king's body. The funeral chamber and the passages  are scarcely even rough-hewn, and the reception halls show a mere  commencement of decoration.** The other tombs of the locality are  divided into two groups, separated by the ravine reserved for the  burying-place of the royal house. The noble families possessed each  their own tomb on the slopes of the hillside; the common people were  laid to rest in pits lower down, almost on the level of the plain.  The cutting and decoration of all these tombs had been entrusted to a  company of contractors, who had executed them according to two or three  stereotyped plans, without any variation, except in size. Nearly all the  walls are bare, or present but few inscriptions; those tombs only are  completed whose occupants died before the Pharaoh.         * The length of Khuniatonu's reign was fixed by Griffith       with almost absolute certainty by means of the dates written       in ink on the jars of wine and preserves found in the ruins       of the palace.         ** The tomb has been found, as I anticipated, in the ravine       which separates the northern after the southern group of       burying-places. The Arabs opened it in 1891, and Grebaut has       since completely excavated it. The scenes depicted in it are       connected with the death and funeral of the Princess       Maqitatonu.    [Illustration: 103.jpg INTERIOR OF A TOMB AT TEL EL-AMARNA]         Drawn by Boudier, after a photograph by Insinger.    The facades of the tombs are cut in the rock, and contain, for the most  part, but one door, the jambs of which are covered on both sides by  several lines of hieroglyphs; and it is just possible to distinguish  traces of the adoration of the radiant Disk on the lintels, together  with the cartouches containing the names of the king and god. The chapel  is a large rectangular chamber, from one end of which opens the inclined  passage leading to the coffin. The roof is sometimes supported by  columns, having capitals decorated with designs of flowers or of geese  hung from the abacus by their feet with their heads turned upwards.    The religious teaching at Tel el-Amarna presents no difference in the  main from that which prevailed in other parts of Egypt.* The Double  of Osiris was supposed to reside in the tomb, or else to take wing to  heaven and embark with Atonu, as elsewhere he would embark with Ea. The  same funerary furniture is needed for the deceased as in other local  cults--ornaments of vitreous paste, amulets, and _Ushabtiu_, or  \"Respondents,\" to labour for the dead man in the fields of Ialu. Those  of Khuniatonu were, like those of Amenothes III., actual statuettes in  granite of admirable workmanship. The dead who reached the divine abode,  retained the same rank in life that they had possessed here below, and  in order to ensure the enjoyment of it, they related, or caused to be  depicted in their tombs, the events of their earthly career.         * The peculiar treatment of the two extremities of the sign       for the sky, which surmounts the great scene on the tomb of       Ahmosis, shows that there had been no change in the ideas       concerning the two horizons or the divine tree found in       them: the aspirations for the soul of Mariri, the high       priest of Atonu, or for that of the sculptor Bauku, are the       same as those usually found, and the formula on the funerary       stelae differs only in the name of the god from that on the       ordinary stelae of the same kind.    A citizen of Khuitatonu would naturally represent the manners and  customs of his native town, and this would account for the local  colouring of the scenes in which we see him taking part.    They bear no resemblance to the traditional pictures of the buildings  and gardens of Thebes with which we are familiar; we have instead the  palaces, colonnades, and pylons of the rising city, its courts planted  with sycomores, its treasuries, and its storehouses. The sun's disk  hovers above and darts its prehensile rays over every object; its hands  present the _crux ansata_ to the nostrils of the various members of the  family, they touch caressingly the queen and her daughters, they handle  the offerings of bread and cakes, they extend even into the government  warehouses to pilfer or to bless. Throughout all these scenes Khuniatonu  and the ladies of his harem seem to be ubiquitous: here he visits one of  the officers, there he repairs to the temple for the dedication of its  sanctuary. His chariot, followed at a little distance by that of the  princesses, makes its way peaceably through the streets. The police of  the city and the soldiers of the guard, whether Egyptians or foreigners,  run before him and clear a path among the crowd, the high priest Mariri  stands at the gate to receive him, and the ceremony is brought to a  close by a distribution of gold necklaces or rings, while the populace  dance with delight before the sovereign. Meantime the slaves have  cooked the repast, the dancers and musicians within their chambers have  rehearsed for the evening's festival, and the inmates of the house carry  on animated dialogues during their meal. The style and the technique of  these wall-paintings differ in no way from those in the necropolis of  the preceding period, and there can be no doubt that the artists who  decorated these monuments were trained in the schools of Thebes. Their  drawing is often very refined, and there is great freedom in their  composition; the perspective of some of the bas-reliefs almost comes  up to our own, and the movement of animated crowds is indicated with  perfect accuracy. It is, however, not safe to conclude from these  examples that the artists who executed them would have developed  Egyptian art in a new direction, had not subsequent events caused a  reaction against the worship of Atonu and his followers.

Although the tombs in which they worked differ from the generality  of Egyptian burying-places, their originality does not arise from any  effort, either conscious or otherwise, to break through the ordinary  routine of the art of the"]]]
