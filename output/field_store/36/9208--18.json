Great mountain  masses appear in the south and south-west. It feels cold, and the sky  is often overcast.    _6th July, 1866._--I took lunars yesterday, after which Mtende invited  us to eat at his house where he had provided a large mess of rice  porridge and bean-leaves as a relish. He says that many Arabs pass him  and many of them die in their journeys. He knows no deaf or dumb  person in the country. He says that he cuts the throats of all animals  to be eaten, and does not touch lion or hyaena.    _7th July, 1866._--We got men from Mtende to carry loads and show the  way. He asked a cloth to ensure his people going to the journey's end  and behaving properly; this is the only case of anything like tribute  being demanded in this journey: I gave him a cloth worth 5s. 6d.  Upland vegetation prevails; trees are dotted here and there among  bushes five feet high, and fine blue and yellow flowers are common. We  pass over a succession of ridges and valleys as in Londa; each valley  has a running stream or trickling rill; garden willows are in full  bloom, and also a species of sage with variegated leaves beneath the  flowers.    When the sepoy Perim threw away the tea and the lead lining, I only  reproved him and promised him punishment if he committed any other  wilful offence, but now he and another skulked behind and gave their  loads to a stranger to carry, with a promise to him that I would pay.  We waited two hours for them; and as the havildar said that they would  not obey him, I gave Perim and the other some smart cuts with a cane,  but I felt that I was degrading myself, and resolved not to do the  punishment myself again.    _8th July, 1866._--Hard travelling through a depopulated country. The  trees are about the size of hop-poles with abundance of tall grass;  the soil is sometimes a little sandy, at other times that reddish,  clayey sort which yields native grain so well. The rock seen uppermost  is often a ferruginous conglomerate, lying on granite rocks. The  gum-copal tree is here a mere bush, and no digging takes place for the  gum: it is called Mchenga, and yields gum when wounded, as also bark,  cloth, and cordage when stripped. Mountain masses are all around us;  we sleep at Linata mountain.    _9th July, 1866._--The Masuko fruit abounds: the name is the same here  as in the Batoka country; there are also rhododendrons of two species,  but the flowers white. We slept in a wild spot, near Mount Leziro,  with many lions roaring about us; one hoarse fellow serenaded us a  long time, but did nothing more. Game is said to be abundant, but we  saw none, save an occasional diver springing away from the path. Some  streams ran to the north-west to the Lismyando, which flows N. for the  Rovuma; others to the south-east for the Loendi.    _10th and 11th July, 1866._--Nothing to interest but the same weary  trudge: our food so scarce that we can only give a handful or half a  pound of grain to each person per day. The Masuko fruit is formed, but  not ripe till rains begin; very few birds are seen or heard, though  there is both food and water in the many grain-bearing grasses and  running streams, which we cross at the junction of every two ridges.  A dead body lay in a hut by the wayside; the poor thing had begun to  make a garden by the stream, probably in hopes of living long enough  (two months or so) on wild fruits to reap a crop of maize.    _12th July, 1866._--A drizzling mist set in during the night and  continued this morning, we set off in the dark, however, leaving our  last food for the havildar and sepoys who had not yet come up. The  streams are now of good size. An Arab brandy bottle was lying broken  in one village called Msapa. We hurried on as fast as we could to the  Luatize, our last stage before getting to Mataka's; this stream is  rapid, about forty yards wide, waist deep, with many podostemons on  the bottom. The country gets more and more undulating and is covered  with masses of green foliage, chiefly Masuko trees, which have large  hard leaves. There are hippopotami further down the river on its way  to the Loendi. A little rice which had been kept for me I divided, but  some did not taste food.    _13th July, 1866._--A good many stragglers behind, but we push on to  get food and send it back to them. The soil all reddish clay, the  roads baked hard by the sun, and the feet of many of us are weary and  sore: a weary march and long, for it is perpetually up and down now. I  counted fifteen running streams in one day: they are at the bottom of  the valley which separates the ridges. We got to the brow of a ridge  about an hour from Mataka's first gardens, and all were so tired that  we remained to sleep; but we first invited volunteers to go on and buy  food, and bring it back early next morning: they had to be pressed to  do this duty.    _14th July, 1866._--As our volunteers did not come at 8 A.M., I set  off to see the cause, and after an hour of perpetual up and down  march, as I descended the steep slope which overlooks the first  gardens, I saw my friends start up at the apparition--they were  comfortably cooking porridge for themselves! I sent men of Mataka  back with food to the stragglers behind and came on to his town.    An Arab, Sef Rupia or Rubea, head of a large body of slaves, on his  way to the coast, most kindly came forward and presented an ox, bag of  flour, and some cooked meat, all of which were extremely welcome to  half-famished men, or indeed under any circumstances. He had heard of  our want of food and of a band of sepoys, and what could the English  think of doing but putting an end to the slave-trade? Had he seen our  wretched escort, all fear of them would have vanished! He had a large  safari or caravan under him. This body is usually divided into ten or  twelve portions, and all are bound to obey the leader to a certain  extent: in this case there were eleven parties, and the traders  numbered about sixty or seventy, who were dark coast Arabs. Each  underling had his men under him, and when I saw them they were busy  making the pens of branches in which their slaves and they sleep. Sef  came on with me to Mataka's, and introduced me in due form with  discharges of gunpowder. I asked him to come back next morning, and  presented three cloths with a request that he would assist the  havildar and sepoys, if he met them, with food: this he generously  did.    We found Mataka's town situated in an elevated valley surrounded by  mountains; the houses numbered at least 1000, and there were many  villages around. The mountains were pleasantly green, and had many  trees which the people were incessantly cutting down. They had but  recently come here: they were besieged by Mazitu at their former  location west of this; after fighting four days they left unconquered,  having beaten the enemy off.    Mataka kept us waiting some time in the verandah of his large square  house, and then made his appearance, smiling with his good-natured  face. He is about sixty years of age, dressed as an Arab, and if we  may judge from the laughter with which his remarks were always  greeted, somewhat humorous. He had never seen any but Arabs before. He  gave me a square house to live in, indeed the most of the houses here  are square, for the Arabs are imitated in everything: they have  introduced the English pea, and we were pleased to see large patches  of it in full bearing, and ripe in moist hollows which had been  selected for it. The numerous springs which come out at various parts  are all made use of. Those parts which are too wet are drained, whilst  beds are regularly irrigated by water-courses and ridges: we had  afterwards occasion to admire the very extensive draining which has  been effected among the hills. Cassava is cultivated on ridges along  all the streets in the town, which give it a somewhat regular and neat  appearance. Peas and tobacco were the chief products raised by  irrigation, but batatas and maize were often planted too: wheat would  succeed if introduced. The altitude is about 2700 feet above the sea:  the air at this time is cool, and many people have coughs.    Mataka soon sent a good mess of porridge and cooked meat (beef); he  has plenty of cattle and sheep: and the next day he sent abundance of  milk. We stand a good deal of staring unmoved, though it is often  accompanied by remarks by no means complimentary; they think that they  are not understood, and probably I do misunderstand sometimes. The  Waiyau jumble their words as I think, and Mataka thought that I did  not enunciate anything, but kept my tongue still when I spoke.    Town of Matak, Moembe. _15th July, 1866._--The safari under Sef set  off this morning for Kilwa. Sef says that about 100 of the Kilwa  people died this year, so slaving as well as philanthropy is  accompanied with loss of life: we saw about seven of their graves; the  rest died on the road up.    There are two roads from this to the Lake, one to Losewa, which is  west of this, and opposite Kotakota; the other, to Makatu, is further  south: the first is five days through deserted country chiefly; but  the other, seven, among people and plenty of provisions all the way.    It struck me after Sef had numbered up the losses that the Kilwa  people sustained by death in their endeavours to \"nslave people,  similar losses on the part of those who go to \"proclaim liberty to the  captives, the opening of the prison to them that are bound,\"--to save  and elevate, need not be made so very much of as they sometimes are.    Soon after our arrival we heard that a number of Mataka's Waiyau had,  without his knowledge, gone to Nyassa, and in a foray carried off  cattle and people: when they came home with the spoil, Mataka ordered  all to be sent back whence they came.

The confederates fell  suddenly upon the marshal's estates and devastated them with fire and  sword. On hearing of this attack Richard immediately left Wales, and,  accompanied by only fifteen knights, took ship for Ireland. On his  arrival Geoffrey Marsh, the meanest of the conspirators, received him  with every profession of cordiality, and urged him to attack his  enemies without delay. Geoffrey was an old man; he had long held the  great post of justiciar of Ireland; and he was himself the liegeman of  the marshal. Richard therefore implicitly trusted him, and forthwith  took the field.    The first warlike operations of Earl Richard were successful. After a  short siege he obtained possession of Limerick, and his enemies were  fain to demand a truce. Richard proposed a conference to be held on  April 1, 1234, on the Curragh of Kildare. The conference proved  abortive, for Geoffrey Marsh cunningly persuaded the marshal to refuse  any offer of terms which the magnates would accept, and Richard found  that he had been duped into taking up a position that he was not strong  enough to maintain. Marsh withdrew from his side, on the ground that he  could not fight against Lacy, whose sister he had married. The marshal  foresaw the worst. \"I know,\" he declared, \"that this day I am delivered  over to death, but it is better to die honourably for the cause of  justice than to flee from the field and become a reproach to  knighthood.\"    The forsworn Irish knights slunk away to neighbouring places of  sanctuary or went over to the enemy. When the final struggle came, later  on the same April 1, Richard had few followers save the faithful fifteen  knights who had crossed over with him from Wales. The little band,  outnumbered by more than nine to one, struggled desperately to the end.  At last the marshal, unhorsed and severely wounded, fell into the hands  of his enemies. They bore him, more dead than alive, to his own castle  of Kilkenny, which had just been seized by the justiciar. After a few  days Richard's tough constitution began to get the better of his wounds.  Then his enemies, showing him the royal warranty for their acts, induced  him to admit them into his castles. An ignorant or treacherous surgeon,  called in by the justiciar, cauterised his wounds so severely that his  sufferings became intense. He died of fever on the 16th, and was buried,  as he himself had willed, in the Franciscan church at Kilkenny. No one  rejoiced at the death of the hero save the traitors who had lured him to  his doom and the Poitevins who had suborned them. Their victim, the weak  king, mourned for his friend as David had lamented Saul and Jonathan.[1]  The treachery of his enemies brought them little profit. While Richard  Marshal lay on his deathbed, a new Archbishop of Canterbury drove the  Poitevins from office.        [1] _Dunstable Ann._, p. 137.    In the heyday of the Poitevins' power the Church sounded a feeble but  clear note of alarm. The pope expostulated with Henry for his treatment  of Hubert de Burgh, and Agnellus of Pisa, the first English provincial  of the newly arrived Franciscan order, strove to reconcile Richard  Marshal with his sovereign in the course of the South-Welsh campaign.  More drastic action was necessary if vague remonstrance was to be  translated into fruitful action. The three years' vacancy of the see of  Canterbury, after the death of Richard le Grand, paralysed the action  of the Church. After the pope's rejection of the first choice of the  convent of Christ Church, the chancellor, Ralph Neville, the monks  elected their own prior, and him also Gregory refused as too old and  incompetent. Their third election fell upon John Blunt, a theologian  high in the favour of Peter des Roches, who sent him to Rome, well  provided with ready money, to secure his confirmation. Simon Langton,  again restored to England, and archdeacon of Canterbury, persuaded the  pope to veto Blunt's appointment on the ground of his having held two  benefices without a dispensation. His rejection was the first check  received by the Poitevin faction. It was promptly followed by a more  crushing blow. Weary of the long delay, Gregory persuaded the Christ  Church monks then present at Rome to elect Edmund Rich, treasurer of  Salisbury. Edmund, a scholar who had taught theology and arts with  great distinction at Paris and Oxford, was still more famous for his  mystical devotion, for his asceticism and holiness of life. He was  however an old man, inexperienced in affairs, and, with all his  gracious gifts, somewhat wanting in the tenacity and vigour which  leadership involved. Yet in sending so eminent a saint to Canterbury,  Rome conferred on England a service second only to that which she had  rendered when she secured the archbishopric for Stephen Langton.    Before his consecration as archbishop on April 2, 1234, Edmund had  already joined with his suffragans on February 2 in upholding the good  fame of the marshal and in warning the king of the disastrous results  of preferring the counsels of the Poitevins to those of his  natural-born subjects. A week after his consecration Edmund succeeded  in carrying out a radical change in the administration. On April 9 he  declared that unless Henry drove away the Poitevins, he would forthwith  pronounce him excommunicate. Yielding at once, Henry sent the Bishop of  Winchester back to his diocese, and deprived Peter of Rivaux of all his  offices. The followers of the two Peters shared their fate, and Henry,  despatching Edmund to Wales to make peace with Llewelyn and the  marshal, hurried to Gloucester in order to meet the archbishop on his  return. His good resolutions were further strengthened by the news of  Earl Richard's death. On arriving at Gloucester he held a council in  which the ruin of the Poitevins was completed. A truce, negotiated by  the archbishop with Llewelyn, was ratified. The partisans of the  marshal were pardoned, even Richard Siward being forgiven his long  career of plunder. Gilbert Marshal, the next brother of the childless  Earl Richard, was invested with his earldom and office, and Henry  himself dubbed him a knight. Hubert de Burgh was included in the  comprehensive pardon. Indignant that his name and seal should have been  used to cover his ex-ministers' treachery to Earl Richard, Henry  overwhelmed them with reproaches, and strove by his violence against  them to purge himself from complicity in their acts. The Poitevins  lurked in sanctuary, fearing for the worst. Segrave forgot his  knighthood, resumed the tonsure, and took refuge in a church in  Leicester. The king's worst indignation was reserved for Peter of  Rivaux. Peter protested that his orders entitled him to immunity from  arrest, but it was found that he wore a mail shirt under his clerical  garments, and, without a word of reproach from the archbishop, he was  immured in a lay prison on the pretext that no true clerk wore armour.  Of the old ministers Ralph Neville alone remained in office.    With Bishop Peter's fall disappeared the last of the influences that  had prevailed during the minority. The king, who felt his dignity  impaired by the Poitevin domination, resolved that henceforward he  would submit to no master. He soon framed a plan of government that  thoroughly satisfied his jealous and exacting nature. Henceforth no  magnates, either of Church or State, should stand between him and his  subjects. He would be his own chief minister, holding in his own hands  all the strings of policy, and acting through subordinates whose sole  duly was to carry out their master's orders. Under such a system the  justiciarship practically ceased to exist. The treasurership was held  for short periods by royal clerks of no personal distinction. Even the  chancellorship became overshadowed. Henry quarrelled with Ralph Neville  in 1238, and withdrew from him the custody of the great seal, though he  allowed him to retain the name and emoluments of chancellor. On  Neville's death the office fell into abeyance for nearly twenty years,  during which time the great seal was entrusted to seven successive  keepers. Like his grandfather, Henry wished to rule in person with the  help of faithful but unobtrusive subordinates. This system, which was  essentially that of the French monarchy, presupposed for success the  constant personal supervision of an industrious and strong-willed king.  Henry III was never a strenuous worker, and his character failed in the  robustness and self-reliance necessary for personal rule. The magnates,  who regarded themselves as the king's natural-born counsellors, were  bitterly incensed, and hated the royal clerks as fiercely as they had  disliked the ministers of his minority. Opposed by the barons,  distrusted by the people, liable to be thrown over by their master at  each fresh change of his caprice, the royal subordinates showed more  eagerness in prosecuting their own private fortunes than in consulting  the interests of the State. Thus the nominal government of Henry proved  extremely ineffective. Huge taxes were raised, but little good came  from them. The magnates held sullenly aloof; the people grumbled; the  Church lamented the evil days. Yet for five and twenty years the  wretched system went on, not so much by reason of its own strength as  because there was no one vigorous enough to overthrow it.    The author of all this mischief was a man of some noble and many  attractive qualities. Save when an occasional outburst of temper showed  him a true son of John, Henry was the kindest, mildest, most amiable of  men. He was the first king since William the Conqueror in whose private  life the austerest critics could find nothing blameworthy. His piety  stands high,"]]]
