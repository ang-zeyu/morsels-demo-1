When he arrived, it  was evident from his look that he knew all and brought confirmation of  their worst fears. He explained the law at great length, and cited  precedent upon precedent. When he ceased, Leah's sobs alone broke the  silence. Samuel's face was white. The merry gathering had been turned to  a wedding party.    \"You rogue!\" burst forth Malka at last. \"You planned all this--you  thought my Leah didn't have enough money, and that Reb Shemuel will heap  you up gold in the hands. But you don't take me in like this.\"    \"May this piece of bread choke me if I had the slightest iota of  intention!\" cried Samuel passionately, for the thought of what Leah  might think was like fire in his veins. He turned appealingly to the  _Maggid_; \"but there must be some way out of this, surely there must be  some way out. I know you _Maggidim_ can split hairs. Can't you make one  of your clever distinctions even when there's more than a trifle  concerned?\" There was a savage impatience about the bridegroom which  boded ill for the Law.    \"Of course there's a way out,\" said the _Maggid_ calmly. \"Only one way,  but a very broad and simple one.\"    \"What's that?\" everybody asked breathlessly.    \"He must give her _Gett_!\"    \"Of course!\" shouted Sam in a voice of thunder. \"I divorce her at once.\"  He guffawed hysterically: \"What a pack of fools we are! Good old Jewish  law!\"    Leah's sobs ceased. Everybody except Mrs. Jacobs was smiling once more.  Half a dozen, hands grasped the _Maggid's_; half a dozen others thumped  him on the back. He was pushed into a chair. They gave him a glass of  brandy, they heaped a plate with fried fish. Verily the _Maggid_, who  was in truth sore ahungered, was in luck's way. He blessed Providence  and the Jewish Marriage Law.    \"But you had better not reckon that a divorce,\" he warned them between  two mouthfuls. \"You had better go to Reb Shemuel, the maiden's father,  and let him arrange the _Gett_ beyond reach of cavil.\"    \"But Reb Shemuel is away,\" said Mrs. Jacobs.    \"And I must go away, too, by the first train to-morrow,\" said Sam.  \"However, there's no hurry. I'll arrange to run up to town again in a  fortnight or so, and then Reb Shemuel shall see that we are properly  untied. You don't mind being my wife for a fortnight, I hope, Miss  Jacobs?\" asked Sam, winking gleefully at Leah. She smiled back at him  and they laughed together over the danger they had just escaped. Hannah  laughed too, in contemptuous amusement at the rigidity of Jewish Law.    \"I'll tell you what, Sam, can't you come back for next Saturday week?\"  said Leah.    \"Why?\" asked Sam. \"What's on?\"    \"The Purim Ball at the Club. As you've got to come back to give Hannah  _Gett_, you might as well come in time to take me to the ball.\"    \"Right you are,\" said Sam cheerfully.    Leah clapped her hands. \"Oh that will be jolly,\" she said. \"And we'll  take Hannah with us,\" she added as an afterthought.    \"Is that by way of compensation for losing my husband?\" Hannah asked  with a smile.    Leah gave a happy laugh, and turned the new ring on her finger in  delighted contemplation.    \"All's well that ends well,\" said Sam. \"Through this joke Leah will be  the belle of the Purim Ball. I think I deserve another piece of plaice,  Leah, for that compliment. As for you, Mr. Maggid, you're a saint and a  Talmud sage!\"    The _Maggid's_ face was brightened by a smile. He intoned the grace with  unction when the meal ended, and everybody joined in heartily at the  specifically vocal portions. Then the _Maggid_ left, and the cards were  brought out.    It is inadvisable to play cards _before_ fried fish, because it is well  known that you may lose, and losing may ruffle your temper, and you may  call your partner an ass, or your partner may call you an ass. To-night  the greatest good humor prevailed, though several pounds changed hands.  They played Loo, \"Klobbiyos,\" Napoleon, Vingt-et-un, and especially  Brag. Solo whist had not yet come in to drive everything else out. Old  Hyams did not _spiel_, because he could not afford to, and Hannah Jacobs  because she did not care to. These and a few other guests left early.  But the family party stayed late. On a warm green table, under a  cheerful gas light, with brandy and whiskey and sweets and fruit to  hand, with no trains or busses to catch, what wonder if the  light-hearted assembly played far into the new day?    Meanwhile the Redeemed Son slept peacefully in his crib with his legs  curled up, and his little fists clenched beneath the coverlet.          CHAPTER V.    THE PAUPER ALIEN.      Moses Ansell married mainly because all men are mortal. He knew he would  die and he wanted an heir. Not to inherit anything, but to say _Kaddish_  for him. _Kaddish_ is the most beautiful and wonderful mourning prayer  ever written. Rigidly excluding all references to death and grief, it  exhausts itself in supreme glorification of the Eternal and in  supplication for peace upon the House of Israel. But its significance  has been gradually transformed; human nature, driven away with a  pitchfork, has avenged itself by regarding the prayer as a mass, not  without purgatorial efficacy, and so the Jew is reluctant to die without  leaving some one qualified to say _Kaddish_ after him every day for a  year, and then one day a year. That is one reason why sons are of such  domestic importance.    Moses had only a mother in the world when he married Gittel Silverstein,  and he hoped to restore the balance of male relatives by this reckless  measure. The result was six children, three girls and three _Kaddishim_.  In Gittel, Moses found a tireless helpmate. During her lifetime the  family always lived in two rooms, for she had various ways of  supplementing the household income. When in London she chared for her  cousin Malka at a shilling a day. Likewise she sewed underlinen and  stitched slips of fur into caps in the privacy of home and midnight. For  all Mrs. Ansell's industry, the family had been a typical group of  wandering Jews, straying from town to town in search of better things.  The congregation they left (every town which could muster the minimum  of ten men for worship boasted its _Kehillah_) invariably paid their  fare to the next congregation, glad to get rid of them so cheaply, and  the new _Kehillah_ jumped at the opportunity of gratifying their  restless migratory instinct and sent them to a newer. Thus were they  tossed about on the battledores of philanthropy, often reverting to  their starting-point, to the disgust of the charitable committees. Yet  Moses always made loyal efforts to find work. His versatility was  marvellous. There was nothing he could not do badly. He had been  glazier, synagogue beadle, picture-frame manufacturer, cantor, peddler,  shoemaker in all branches, coat-seller, official executioner of fowls  and cattle, Hebrew teacher, fruiterer, circumciser, professional  corpse-watcher, and now he was a tailor out of work.    Unquestionably Malka was right in considering Moses a _Schlemihl_ in  comparison with many a fellow-immigrant, who brought indefatigable hand  and subtle brain to the struggle for existence, and discarded the prop  of charity as soon as he could, and sometimes earlier.    It was as a hawker that he believed himself most gifted, and he never  lost the conviction that if he could only get a fair start, he had in  him the makings of a millionaire. Yet there was scarcely anything cheap  with which he had not tramped the country, so that when poor Benjamin,  who profited by his mother's death to get into the Orphan Asylum, was  asked to write a piece of composition on \"The Methods of Travelling,\" he  excited the hilarity of the class-room by writing that there were  numerous ways of travelling, for you could travel with sponge, lemons,  rhubarb, old clothes, jewelry, and so on, for a page of a copy book.  Benjamin was a brilliant boy, yet he never shook off some of the  misleading associations engendered by the parental jargon. For Mrs.  Ansell had diversified her corrupt German by streaks of incorrect  English, being of a much more energetic and ambitious temperament than  the conservative Moses, who dropped nearly all his burden of English  into her grave. For Benjamin, \"to travel\" meant to wander about selling  goods, and when in his books he read of African travellers, he took it  for granted that they were but exploiting the Dark Continent for small  profits and quick returns.    And who knows? Perhaps of the two species, it was the old Jewish  peddlers who suffered the more and made the less profit on the average.  For the despised three-hatted scarecrow of Christian caricature, who  shambled along snuffling \"Old clo',\" had a strenuous inner life, which  might possibly have vied in intensity, elevation, and even sense of  humor, with that of the best of the jeerers on the highway. To Moses,  \"travelling\" meant straying forlornly in strange towns and villages,  given over to the worship of an alien deity and ever ready to avenge his  crucifixion; in a land of whose tongue he knew scarce more than the  Saracen damsel married by legend to a Becket's father. It meant praying  brazenly in crowded railway trains, winding the phylacteries sevenfold  round his left arm and crowning his forehead with a huge leather bump of  righteousness, to the bewilderment or irritation of unsympathetic  fellow-passengers. It meant living chiefly on dry bread and drinking  black tea out of his own cup, with meat and fish and the good things of  life utterly banned by the traditional law, even if he were flush. It  meant carrying the red rag of an obnoxious personality through a land of  bulls. It meant passing months away from wife and children, in a  solitude only occasionally alleviated by a Sabbath spent in a synagogue  town. It meant putting up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1271"],[0,"Bygone Beliefs: Being a Series of Excursions in the Byways of Thought (#16)"],[1,"the  powers of the spiritual world for the production of marvellous results,  BY THE AID OF SYMBOLS.\" It has, on the other hand, been questioned  whether the appeal to the spirit-world is an essential element in magic.  But a close examination of magical practices always reveals at the root  a belief in spiritual powers as the operating causes. The belief in  talismans at first sight seems to have little to do with that in a  supernatural realm; but, as we have seen, the talisman was always a  silent invocation of the powers of some spiritual being with which it  was symbolically connected, and whose sign was engraved thereon. And,  as Dr T. WITTON DAVIES well remarks with regard to \"sympathetic magic\":  \"Even this could not, at the start, be anything other than a symbolic  prayer to the spirit or spirits having authority in these matters. In so  far as no spirit is thought of, it is a mere survival, and not magic at  all....\"(1)      (1) Dr T. WITTON DAVIES: _Magic, Divination, and Demonology among the  Hebrews and their Neighbours_ (1898), p. 17.      What I regard as the two essentials of magical practices, namely,  the use of symbols and the appeal to the supernatural realm, are most  obvious in what is called \"ceremonial magic\". Mediaeval ceremonial magic  was subdivided into three chief branches--White Magic, Black Magic, and  Necromancy. White magic was concerned with the evocations of angels,  spiritual beings supposed to be essentially superior to mankind,  concerning which I shall give some further details later--and the  spirits of the elements,--which were, as I have mentioned in \"Some  Characteristics of Mediaeval Thought,\" personifications of the primeval  forces of Nature. As there were supposed to be four elements, fire,  air, water, and earth, so there were supposed to be four classes of  elementals or spirits of the elements, namely, Salamanders, Sylphs,  Undines, and Gnomes, inhabiting these elements respectively, and  deriving their characters therefrom. Concerning these curious beings,  the inquisitive reader may gain some information from a quaint little  book, by the Abbe de MONTFAUCON DE VILLARS, entitled _The Count of  Gabalis, or Conferences about Secret Sciences_ (1670), translated into  English and published in 1680, which has recently been reprinted. The  elementals, we learn therefrom, were, unlike other supernatural beings,  thought to be mortal. They could, however, be rendered immortal by means  of sexual intercourse with men or women, as the case might be; and it  was, we are told, to the noble end of endowing them with this great  gift, that the sages devoted themselves.    Goety, or black magic, was concerned with the evocation of demons and  devils--spirits supposed to be superior to man in certain powers, but  utterly depraved. Sorcery may be distinguished from witchcraft, inasmuch  as the sorcerer attempted to command evil spirits by the aid of charms,  _etc_., whereas the witch or wizard was supposed to have made a pact  with the Evil One; though both terms have been rather loosely used,  \"sorcery\" being sometimes employed as a synonym for \"necromancy\".  Necromancy was concerned with the evocation of the spirits of the dead:  etymologically, the term stands for the art of foretelling events by  means of such evocations, though it is frequently employed in the wider  sense.    It would be unnecessary and tedious to give any detailed account of the  methods employed in these magical arts beyond some general remarks. Mr  A. E. WAITE gives full particulars of the various rituals in his  _Book of Ceremonial Magic_ (1911), to which the curious reader may be  referred. The following will, in brief terms, convey a general idea of a  magical evocation:--    Choosing a time when there is a favourable conjunction of the planets,  the magician, armed with the implements of magical art, after much  prayer and fasting, betakes himself to a suitable spot, alone, or  perhaps accompanied by two trusty companions. All the articles he  intends to employ, the vestments, the magic sword and lamp, the  talismans, the book of spirits, _etc_., have been specially prepared and  consecrated. If he is about to invoke a martial spirit, the magician's  vestment will be of a red colour, the talismans in virtue of which  he may have power over the spirit will be of iron, the day chosen a  Tuesday, and the incense and perfumes employed of a nature analogous  to Mars. In a similar manner all the articles employed and the rites  performed must in some way be symbolical of the spirit with which  converse is desired. Having arrived at the spot, the magician first of  all traces the magic circle within which, we are told, no evil spirit  can enter; he then commences the magic rite, involving various prayers  and conjurations, a medley of meaningless words, and, in the case of the  black art, a sacrifice. The spirit summoned then appears (at least, so  we are told), and, after granting the magician's request, is licensed to  depart--a matter, we are admonished, of great importance.    The question naturally arises, What were the results obtained by these  magical arts? How far, if at all, was the magician rewarded by the  attainment of his desires? We have asked a similar question regarding  the belief in talismans, and the reply which we there gained undoubtedly  applies in the present case as well. Modern psychical research, as I  have already pointed out, is supplying us with further evidence for  the survival of human personality after bodily death than the innate  conviction humanity in general seems to have in this belief, and the  many reasons which idealistic philosophy advances in favour of it. The  question of the reality of the phenomenon of \"materialisation,\" that is,  the bodily appearance of a discarnate spirit, such as is vouched for by  spiritists, and which is what, it appears, was aimed at in necromancy  (though why the discarnate should be better informed as to the future  than the incarnate, I cannot suppose), must be regarded as _sub  judice_.(1) Many cases of fraud in connection with the alleged  production of this phenomenon have been detected in recent times; but,  inasmuch as the last word has not yet been said on the subject, we  must allow the possibility that necromancy in the past may have been  sometimes successful. But as to the existence of the angels and  devils of magical belief--as well, one might add, of those of orthodox  faith,--nothing can be adduced in evidence of this either from the  results of psychical research or on _a priori_ grounds.      (1) The late Sir WILLIAM CROOKES' _Experimental Researches in the  Phenomena of Spiritualism_ contains evidence in favour of the reality of  this phenomenon very difficult to gainsay.      Pseudo-DIONYSIUS classified the angels into three hierarchies, each  subdivided into three orders, as under:--      _First Hierarchy_.--Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones;    _Second Hierarchy_.--Dominions, Powers, and Authorities (or Virtues);    _Third Hierarchy_.--Principalities, Archangels, and Angels,--    and this classification was adopted by AGRIPPA and others.  Pseudo-DIONYSIUS explains the names of these orders as follows: \"... the  holy designation of the Seraphim denotes either that they are kindling  or burning; and that of the Cherubim, a fulness of knowledge or stream  of wisdom.... The appellation of the most exalted and pre-eminent  Thrones denotes their manifest exaltation above every grovelling  inferiority, and their super-mundane tendency towards higher things;...  and their invariable and firmly-fixed settlement around the veritable  Highest, with the whole force of their powers.... The explanatory  name of the Holy Lordships (Dominions) denotes a certain unslavish  elevation... superior to every kind of cringing slavery, indomitable  to every subserviency, and elevated above every dissimularity, ever  aspiring to the true Lordship and source of Lordship.... The appellation  of the Holy Powers denotes a certain courageous and unflinching  virility... vigorously conducted to the Divine imitation, not forsaking  the Godlike movement through its own unmanliness, but unflinchingly  looking to the super-essential and powerful-making power, and becoming  a powerlike image of this, as far as is attainable....The appellation of  the Holy Authorities... denotes the beautiful and unconfused good  order, with regard to Divine receptions, and the discipline of the  super-mundane and intellectual authority... conducted indomitably,  with good order towards Divine things.... (And the appellation) of the  Heavenly Principalities manifests their princely and leading function,  after the Divine example....\"(1) There is a certain grandeur in these  views, and if we may be permitted to understand by the orders of the  hierarchy, \"discrete\" degrees (to use SWEDENBORG'S term) of spiritual  reality--stages in spiritual involution,--we may see in them a certain  truth as well. As I said, all virtue, power, and knowledge which man  has from God was believed to descend to him by way of these angelical  hierarchies, step by step; and thus it was thought that those of the  lowest hierarchy alone were sent from heaven to man. It was such beings  that white magic pretended to evoke. But the practical occultists, when  they did not make them altogether fatuous, attributed to these angels  characters not distinguishable from those of the devils. The description  of the angels in the _Heptemeron_, or _Magical Elements_,(2) falsely at   may be taken as fairly characteristic. Of MICHAEL and the other  spirits of Sunday he writes: \"Their nature is to procure Gold, Gemmes,  Carbuncles, Riches; to cause one to obtain favour and benevolence; to  dissolve the enmities of men; to raise men to honors; to carry or take  away infirmities.\" Of GABRIEL and the other spirits of Monday, he says:  \"Their nature is to give silver; to convey things from place to"]]]
