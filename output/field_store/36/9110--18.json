But after we had satisfied our friends in as much as we could,  suggestions of baths, clothes, and luncheon were made which were very  welcome. So we settled down to what promised to be a long and weary  waiting.    The States Model Schools is a one-storied building of considerable size  and solid structure, which occupies a corner formed by two roads through  Pretoria. It consists of twelve large class-rooms, seven or eight of  which were used by the British officers as dormitories and one as a  dining-room; a large lecture-hall, which served as an improvised  fives-court; and a well-fitted gymnasium. It stood in a quadrangular  playground about one hundred and twenty yards square, in which were a  dozen tents for the police guards, a cookhouse, two tents for the  soldier servants, and a newly set-up bath-shed. I do not know how the  arrival of other prisoners may have modified these arrangements, but at  the time of my coming into the prison, there was room enough for  everyone.    The Transvaal Government provided a daily ration of bully beef and  groceries, and the prisoners were allowed to purchase from the local  storekeeper, a Mr. Boshof, practically everything they cared to order,  except alcoholic liquors. During the first week of my detention we  requested that this last prohibition might be withdrawn, and after  profound reflection and much doubtings, the President consented to  countenance the buying of bottled beer. Until this concession was  obtained our liquid refreshment would have satisfied the most immoderate  advocate of temperance, and the only relief was found when the Secretary  of State for War, a kind-hearted Portuguese, would smuggle in a bottle  of whiskey hidden in his tail-coat pocket or amid a basket of fruit. A  very energetic and clever young officer of the Dublin Fusiliers,  Lieutenant Grimshaw, undertook the task of managing the mess, and when  he was assisted by another subaltern--Lieutenant Southey, of the Royal  Irish Fusiliers--this became an exceedingly well-conducted concern. In  spite of the high prices prevailing in Pretoria--prices which were  certainly not lowered for our benefit--the somewhat meagre rations which  the Government allowed were supplemented, until we lived, for three  shillings a day, quite as well as any regiment on service.    On arrival, every officer was given a new suit of clothes, bedding,  towels, and toilet necessaries, and the indispensable Mr, Boshof was  prepared to add to this wardrobe whatever might be required on payment  either in money or by a cheque on Messrs. Cox & Co., whose accommodating  fame had spread even to this distant hostile town. I took an early  opportunity to buy a suit of tweeds of a dark neutral colour, and as  unlike the suits of clothes issued by the Government as possible. I  would also have purchased a hat, but another officer told me that he had  asked for one and had been refused. After all, what use could I find for  a hat, when there were plenty of helmets to spare if I wanted to Walk in  the courtyard? And yet my taste ran towards a slouch hat.    The case of the soldiers was less comfortable than ours. Their rations  were very scanty: only one pound of bully beef once a week and two  pounds of bread; the rest was made up with mealies, potatoes, and  such-like--and not very much of them. Moreover, since they had no  money of their own, and since prisoners of war received no pay, they  were unable to buy even so much as a pound of tobacco. In consequence  they complained a good deal, and were, I think, sufficiently  discontented to require nothing but leading to make them rise against  their guards.    The custody and regulating of the officers were entrusted to a board of  management, four of whose members visited us frequently and listened to  any complaints or requests. M. de Souza, the Secretary of War, was  perhaps the most friendly and obliging of these, and I think we owed  most of the indulgences to his representations. He was a far-seeing  little man who had travelled to Europe, and had a very clear conception  of the relative strengths of Britain and the Transvaal. He enjoyed a  lucrative and influential position under the Government, and was  therefore devoted to its interests, but he was nevertheless suspected by  the Inner Ring of Hollanders and the Relations of the President of  having some sympathy for the British. He had therefore to be very  careful. Commandant Opperman, who was directly responsible for our safe  custody, was in times of peace a Landrost or Justice. He was too fat to  go and fight, but he was an honest and patriotic Boer, who would have  gladly taken an active part in the war. He firmly believed that the  Republics would win, and when, as sometimes happened, bad news reached  Pretoria, Opperman looked a picture of misery, and would come to us and  speak of his resolve to shoot his wife and children and perish in the  defence of the capital. Dr. Gunning was an amiable little Hollander,  fat, rubicund, and well educated. He was a keen politician, and much  attached to the Boer Government, which paid him an excellent salary for  looking after the State Museum. He had a wonderful collection of postage  stamps, and was also engaged in forming a Zoological Garden. This last  ambition had just before the war led him into most serious trouble, for  he was unable to resist the lion which Mr. Rhodes had offered him. He  confided to me that the President had spoken 'most harshly' to him in  consequence, and had peremptorily ordered the immediate return of the  beast under threats of instant dismissal. Gunning said that he could not  have borne such treatment, but that after all a man must live. My  private impression is that he will acquiesce in any political settlement  which leaves him to enlarge his museum undisturbed. But whether the  Transvaal will be able to indulge in such luxuries, after blowing up  many of other people's railway bridges, is a question which I cannot  answer.    The fourth member of the Board, Mr. Malan, was a foul and objectionable  brute. His personal courage was better suited to insulting the prisoners  in Pretoria than to fighting the enemy at the front. He was closely  related to the President, but not even this advantage could altogether  protect him from taunts of cowardice, which were made even in the  Executive Council, and somehow filtered down to us. On one occasion he  favoured me with some of his impertinence; but I reminded him that in  war either side may win, and asked whether he was wise to place himself  in a separate category as regards behaviour to the prisoners. 'Because,'  quoth I, 'it might be so convenient to the British Government to be able  to make one or two examples.' He was a great gross man, and his colour  came and went on a large over-fed face; so that his uneasiness was  obvious. He never came near me again, but some days later the news of a  Boer success arrived, and on the strength of this he came to the prison  and abused a subaltern in the Dublin Fusiliers, telling him that he was  no gentleman, and other things which it is not right to say to a  prisoner. The subaltern happens to be exceedingly handy with his fists,  so that after the war is over Mr. Malan is going to get his head punched  quite independently of the general settlement.    Although, as I have frequently stated, there were no legitimate grounds  of complaint against the treatment of British regular officers while  prisoners of war, the days I passed at Pretoria were the most monotonous  and among the most miserable of my life. Early in the sultry mornings,  for the heat at this season of the year was great, the soldier  servants--prisoners like ourselves--would bring us a cup of coffee, and  sitting up in bed we began to smoke the cigarettes and cigars of another  idle, aimless day. Breakfast was at nine: a nasty uncomfortable meal.  The room was stuffy, and there are more enlivening spectacles than  seventy British officers caught by Dutch farmers and penned together in  confinement. Then came the long morning, to be killed somehow by  reading, chess, or cards--and perpetual cigarettes. Luncheon at one: the  same as breakfast, only more so; and then a longer afternoon to follow a  long morning. Often some of the officers used to play rounders in the  small yard which we had for exercise. But the rest walked moodily up and  down, or lounged over the railings and returned the stares of the  occasional passers-by. Later would come the 'Volksstem'--permitted by  special indulgence--with its budget of lies.    Sometimes we get a little fillip of excitement. One evening, as I was  leaning over the railings, more than forty yards from the nearest  sentry, a short man with a red moustache walked quickly down the street,  followed by two colley dogs. As he passed, but without altering his pace  in the slightest, or even looking towards me, he said quite distinctly  'Methuen beat the Boers to hell at Belmont.' That night the air seemed  cooler and the courtyard larger. Already we imagined the Republics  collapsing and the bayonets of the Queen's Guards in the streets of  Pretoria. Next day I talked to the War Secretary. I had made a large map  upon the wall and followed the course of the war as far as possible by  making squares of red and green paper to represent the various columns.  I said: 'What about Methuen? He has beaten you at Belmont. Now he should  be across the Modder. In a few days he will relieve Kimberley.' De Souza  shrugged his shoulders. 'Who can tell?' he replied; 'but,' he put his  finger on the map, 'there stands old Piet Cronje in a position called  Scholz Nek, and we don't think Methuen will ever get past him.' The  event justified his words, and the battle which we call Magersfontein  (and ought to call 'Maasfontayne') the Boers call Scholz Nek.

Isabelle Meunier for the _Democratic  Pacifique_ and other French gazettes.      [Footnote A: The controversy is wittily described in the following  extract from a Parisian journal, _L'Entr*ficte_, of the 20th of October,  1846:    \"Un grand journal accusait l'autre jour M. Old-Nick d'avoir vole un  orang-outang. Cet interessant animal flanait dans le feuilleton de _la  Quotidienne_, lorsque M. Old-Nick le vit, le trouva a son gout et s'en  empara. Notre confrere avait sans doute besoin d'un groom. On sait que  les Anglais ont depuis long-temps colonise les orangs-outangs, et les ont  instruits dans Part de porter bottes. Il paraitrait, toujours suivant le  meme grand journal, que M. Old-Nick, apres avoir derobe cet orang-outang  a _la Quotidienne_, l'aurait ensuite cede au _Commerce_, comme propriete  a lui appartenant. Je sais que M. Old-Nick est un garcon plein d'esprit  et plein d'honneur, assez riche de son propre fond pour ne pas  s'approprier les orangs-outangs des autres; cette accusation me surprit.  Apres tout, me dis-je, il y a eu des monomanies plus extraodinaires que  celle-la; le grand Bacon ne pouvait voir un baton de cire a cacheter sans  se l'approprier: dans une conference avec M. de Metternich aux Tuileries,  l'Empereur s'apercut que le diplomate autrichien glissait des pains a  cacheter dans sa poche. M. Old-Nick a une autre manic, il fait les  orangs-outangs. Je m'attendais toujours a ce que la _Quotidienne_ jeat  feu et flammes et demandat a grads cris son homme des bois. Il faut vous  dire ques j'avais la son histoire dans _le Commerce_, elle etait  charmante d'esprit et de style, pleine de rapidite et de desinvolture;  _la Quotidienne_ l'avait egalement publiee, mais en trois feuilletons.  L'orang-outang du _Commerce_ n'avait que neuf colonnes. Il s'agissait  done d'un autre quadrumane litteraire. Ma foi non! c'etait le meme;  seulement il n'appartenait ni a _la Quotidienne_, ni au _Commerce_. M.  Old-Nick l'avait emprunte a un romancier American qu'il est en train  d'inventer dans la _Revue des Deux-Mondes_. Ce romancier s'appelle Poe;  je ne dis pas contraire. Voila done un ecrivain qui use du droit legitime  d'arranger les nouvelles d'un romancier American qu'il a invente, et on  l'accuse de plagiat, de vol au feuilleton; on alarme ses amis en leu  faisant croire que set ecrivain est possede de la monomaine des  orangs-outangs. Par la Courchamps! voila qui me parait leger. M. Old Nick  a ecrit au journal en question une reponse pour retablir sa moralite,  attaquee a l'endroit des orangs-outangs. Cet orang-outang a mis, ces  jours derniers, toute la litterature en emoi; personne n'a cru un seul  instant a l'accusation qu'on a essaye, de faire peser sur M. Old Nick,  d'autant plus qu'il avait pris soin d'indiquer luimeme la cage ou il  avait pris son orang-outang. Ceci va fournir de nouvelles armes a la  secte qui ereit aux romanciers Americans. Le prejuge de l'existence de  Cooper en prendra des nouvelles forces. En attendant que la verite se  decouvre, nous sommes forces de convenir que ce Poe est un gaillard bien  fin, bien spirituel, quand il est arre par M. Old-Nick.\"]      In New York Poe entered upon a new sort of life. Heretofore, from the  Commencement of his literary career, he had resided in provincial  towns. Now he was in a metropolis, and with a reputation which might have  served as a passport to any society he might desire. For the first time  he was received into circles capable of both the appreciation and the  production of literature. He added to his fame soon after he came to the  city by the publication of that remarkable composition \"The Raven,\" of  which Mr. Willis has observed that in his opinion \"it is the most  effective single example of fugitive poetry ever published in this  country, and is unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception,  masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent sustaining of  imaginative lift;\" and by that of one of the most extraordinary  instances of the naturalness of detail---the verisimilitude of minute  narrative--for which lie was preeminently distinguished, his \"Mesmeric  Revelation,\" purporting to be the last conversation of a somnambule, held  with his magnetizer just before his death, which was followed by the yet  more striking exhibition of abilities in the same way, entitled \"The  Facts in the case of M. Vaklemar,\" in which the subject is represented as  having been mesmerized in _articulo mortis_. These pieces were reprinted  throughout the literary and philosophical world, in nearly all languages,  everywhere causing sharp and curious speculation, and where readers could  be persuaded that they were fables, challenging a reluctant but genuine  admiration.    He had not been long in New York before he was engaged by Mr. Willis and  General Morris as a critic and assistant editor of _The Mirror_. He  remained in this situation about six months, when he became associated  with Mr. Briggs in the conduct of _The Broadway Journal_, which, in  October 1845, passed entirely into his possession. He had now the long  sought but never before enjoyed absolute control of a literary gazette,  and, with much friendly assistance, he maintained it long enough to show,  that whatever his genius, he had not the kind or degree of talent  necessary to such a position. His chief critical writing in _The Broadway  Journal_, were a paper on Miss Barrett's Poems, and a long discussion of  the subject of plagiarism, with especial reference to Mr. Longfellow. In  March, 1845, he had given a lecture at the Society Library upon the  American poets, composed, for the most part, of fragments of his  previously published reviewals; and in the autumn he accepted an  invitation to read a poem before the Boston Lyceum. A week after the  event, he printed in _The Broadway Journal_ the following account of it,  in reply to a paragraph in one of the city papers, founded upon a  statement in the _Boston Transcript_.    \"Our excellent friend, Major Noah, has suffered himself to be cajoled by  that most beguiling of all beguiling little divinities, Miss Walter, of  _The Transcript_. We have been looking all over her article with the aid  of a taper, to see if we could discover a single syllable of truth in  it--and really blush to acknowledge that we cannot. The adorable creature  has been telling a parcel of fibs about us, by way of revenge for  something that we did to Mr. Longfellow (who admires her very much) and  for calling her 'a pretty little witch' into the bargain. The facts of  the case seem to be these: We _were_ invited 'deliver'(stand and deliver)  a poem before the Boston Lyceum. As a matter of course, we accepted the  invitation. The audience was 'large and distinguished.' Mr Cushing[B]  preceded us with a very capital discourse. He was much applauded. On  arising we were most cordially received. We occupied some fifteen minutes  with an apology for not 'delivering,' as is usual in such cases, a  didactic poem: a didactic poem, in our opinion, being precisely no poem  at all. After some farther words--still of apology--for the  'indefiniteness' and 'general imbecility' of what we had to offer--all  so unworthy a _Bostonian_ audience--we commenced, and with many  interruptions of applause, concluded. Upon the whole, the approbation was  considerably more (the more the pity too) than that bestowed upon Mr.  Cushing. When we had made an end the audience of course arose to depart;  and about one-tenth of them, probably, had really departed, when Mr.  Coffin, one of the managing committee, arrested those who remained, by  the announcement that we had been requested to deliver 'The Raven.' We  delivered 'The Raven' forthwith--(without taking a receipt)--were very  cordially applauded again--and this was the end of it--with the exception  of the sad tale invented to suit her own purposes, by that amiable little  enemy of ours, Miss Walter. We shall never call a woman 'a pretty little  witch' again as long as we live.      [Footnote B: Hon. Caleb Cushing, then recently returned from his mission  to China.]      \"We like Boston. We were born there--and perhaps it is just as well not  to mention that we are heartily ashamed of the fact. The Bostonians are  very well in their way. Their hotels are bad. Their pumpkin pies are  delicious. Their poetry is not so good. Their common is no common  thing--and the duck-pond might answer-if its answer could be heard for  the frogs. But with all these good qualities, the Bostonians have no  soul. They have always evinced toward us, individually, the basest  ingratitude for the services we rendered them in enlightening them about  the originality of Mr. Longfellow. When we accepted, therefore, an  invitation to 'deliver' a poem in Boston, we accepted it simply and  solely, because we had a curiosity to know how it felt to be publicly  hissed--and because we wished to see what effect we could produce by a  neat little _impromptu_ speech in reply. Perhaps, however, we overrated  our own importance, or the Bostonian want of common civility--which is  not quite so manifest as one or two of their editors would wish the  public to believe. We assure Major Noah that he is wrong. The Bostonians  are well-bred--as _very_ dull persons very generally are. Still, with  their vile ingratitude staring us in the eyes, it could scarcely be  supposed that we would put ourselves to the trouble of composing for the  Bostonians anything in the shape of an _original_ "]]]
