The older the honey is, the whiter coloured the Metheglin will be.      TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN OF SIR JOHN FORTESCUE    Take twelve Gallons of water, one handful of each of these herbs,  Eglantine, Rosemary, Parsley, Strawberry-leaves, Wild-thyme, Balm,  Liver-wort, Betony, Scabious; when your water begins to boil, cast in your  herbs, and let them boil a quarter of an hour. Then strain it from the  herbs. When it is almost cold, then put in as much of the best honey, as  will make it bear an Egge, to the breadth of two pence; and stir it till  all the honey be melted. Then boil it well half an hour at the least, and  put into it the whites of six Eggs beaten to a froth to clarifie it; and  when it hath drawn all the scum to the top, strain it into woodden vessels.  When it is almost cold, put barm to it, and when it worketh well, Tun it  into a well-seasoned vessel, where neither Ale nor Beer hath been, for  marring the colour; and when it hath done working, take a good quantity of  Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamon, Cloves and Ginger bruised, and put it into a  boulter bag, and hang it in the barrel.    If you will have it taste much of the spice, let it boil 3 or 4 walms in  it, after you have put in the honey. But that will make it have a deep  colour.      A RECEIPT FOR MEATHE    To seven quarts of water, take two quarts of honey, and mix it well  together; then set it on the fire to boil, and take three or four  Parsley-roots, and as many Fennel-roots, and shave them clean, and slice  them, and put them into the Liquor, and boil altogether, and skim it very  well all the while it is a boyling; and when there will no more scum rise,  then is it boiled enough: but be careful that none of the scum do boil into  it. Then take it off, and let it cool till the next day. Then put it up in  a close vessel, and put thereto half a pint of new good barm, and a very  few Cloves pounded and put in a Linnen-cloth, and tie it in the vessel, and  stop it up close; and within a fortnight, it will be ready to drink: but if  it stay longer, it will be the better.      MY LORD GORGE HIS MEATHE    Take a sufficient quantity of Rain-water, and boil in it the tops of  Rose-mary, Eglantine, Betony, Strawberry-leaves, Wall-flowers, Borage and  Bugloss, of each one handful; one sprig of Bays; and two or three of Sage.  Then take it off the fire, and put a whole raw Egge into it, and pour so  much honey to it, till the Egge rise up to the top; then boil it again,  skiming it very well, and so let it cool. Then Tun it up, and put Barm to  it, that it may ferment well. Then stop it up, and hang in it such spices,  as you like best. It will not be right to drink under three or four  moneths.      THE LADY VERNON'S WHITE METHEGLIN    Take three Gallons of water (rain water is best) boil in it broad Thyme,  Rose-mary, Peny-royal, of each three handfuls. Then put it into a stone Pan  to cool, and strain away the herbs; and when it is cold, put in one quart  of honey, and mix it very well; then put to it one Nutmeg, a little  Cinnamon; Cloves and Ginger; some Orange and Limon-peels. Then boil and  scum it very well, while any scum will rise. Then put in your spices, and  try with a New-laid-egg; and the stronger it is, the longer you may keep  it; and if you will drink it presently, put it up in bottles, and rub the  Corks with yest, that it may touch it, and it will be ready in three or  four days to drink. And if you make it in the spring put no spices, but  Cloves and Cinnamon, and add Violets, Cowslips, Marigolds, and  Gilly-flowers; and be sure to stop your vessel close with Cork; and to this  put no yest, for the Clove-gilly-flowers will set it to work.      SEVERAL SORTS OF MEATH, SMALL AND STRONG    1. SMALL. Take ten Gallons of water, and five quarts of honey, with a  little Rosemary, more Sweet-bryar, some Balme, Burnet, Cloves, less Ginger,  Limon Peel. Tun it with a little barm; let it remain a week in the barrel  with a bag of Elder-flowers; then bottle it.    2. _Small_. Take ten quarts of water, and one of honey, Balm a little;  Minth, Cloves, Limon-peel, Elder-flowers, a little Ginger; wrought with a  little yest, bottle it after a night working.    3. _Strong_. Take ten Gallons of water; thirteen quarts of honey, with  Angelica, Borrage and Bugloss, Rosemary, Balm and Sweet-bryar; pour it into  a barrel, upon three spoonfuls of yest; hang in a bag Cloves,  Elder-flowers, and a little Ginger.    4. _Very Strong_. Take ten Gallons of Water, and four of honey, with  Sea-worm-wood, a little Sage, Rosemary; put it in a barrel, after three  days cooling. Put no yest to it. Stop it close, and bottle it after three  or four months.    5. _Very Strong_. To ten Gallons of water take four of honey. Clarifie it  with flower; and put into it Angelica, Rosemary, Bay-leaves, Balm. Barrel  it without yest. Hang in a bag Cloves, Elder-flowers, a little Ginger.    6. _Very Strong_. Take ten Gallons of water, and four of Honey. Boil  nothing in it. Barrel it when cold, without yest. Hang in it a bag with  Cloves, Elder-flowers, a little Ginger and Limon peel; which throw away,  when it hath done working, and stop it close. You may make also strong and  small by putting into it Orris-roots; or with Rose-mary, Betony, Eye-bright  and Wood-sorrel; or adding to it the tops of Hypericon with the flowers of  it; Sweet-bryar, Lilly of the valley.      TO MAKE MEATH    Take three Gallons of water, a quart of Honey; if it be not strong enough,  you may adde more. Boil it apace an hour, and scum it very clean. Then take  it off, and set it a working at such heat as you set Beer, with good yest.  Then put it in a Runlet, and at three days end, draw it out in  stone-bottles; into everyone put a piece of Limon-peel and two Cloves. It  is only put into the Runlet, whilest it worketh, to avoid the breaking of  the Bottles.      SIR JOHN ARUNDEL'S WHITE MEATH    Take three Gallons of Honey, and twelve Gallons of water: mix the honey and  water very well together, till the honey is dissolved; so let it stand  twelve hours. Then put in a New-laid-egg; if the Liquor beareth the Egg,  that you see the breadth of a groat upon the Egg dry, you may set it over  the fire: if it doth not bear the Egg, then you must adde a quart or three  pints more to the rest; and then set it over the fire, and let it boil  gently, till you have skimed it very clean, and clarified it, as you would  do Suggar, with the whites of three New-laid-eggs. When it is thus made  clear from all scum, let it boil a full hour or more, till the fourth part  of it is wasted; then take it off the fire; and let it stand till the next  day. Then put it into a vessel. When it hath been in the barrel five or six  days, make a white tost, and dip it into new yeast, and put the tost into  the barrel, and let it work. When it hath done working, stop it up very  close. This keep three quarters of a year. You may drink it within half a  year, if you please. You may adde in the boiling, of what herbs you like  the taste, or what is Physical.      TO MAKE METHEGLIN    Take eight Gallons of water, and set it over a clear fire in a Kettle; and  when it is warm, put into it sixteen pounds of very good honey; stir it  well together, till it be all mixed; and when it boileth, take off the  scum, and put in two large Nutmegs cut into quarters, and so let it boil at  least an hour. Then take it off, and put into it two good handfuls of  grinded Malt, and with a white staff keep beating it together, till it be  almost cold; then strain it through a hair sieve into a tub, and put to it  a wine pint of Ale-yest, and stir it very well together; and when it is  cold, you may, if you please, Tun it up presently in a vessel fit for it,  or else let it stand, and work a day: And when it hath done working in your  vessel, stop it up very close. It will be three weeks or a month, before it  will be ready to drink.      TO MAKE WHITE MEATH    Take six Gallons of water, and put in six quarts of honey, stirring it till  the honey be throughly melted; then set it over the fire, and when it is  ready to boil, skim it very clean. Then put in a quarter of ounce of Mace,  so much Ginger, half an ounce of Nutmegs, Sweet-marjoram, Broad-thyme, and  Sweet-bryar, of altogether a handful; and boil them well therein; Then set  it by, till it be through cold, and then Barrel it up, and keep it till it  be ripe.      TO MAKE A MEATH GOOD FOR THE LIVER AND LUNGS    Take of the Roots of Coltsfoot, Fennel and Fearn each four Ounces. Of  Succory-roots, Sorrel-roots, Strawberry-roots, Bitter-sweet-roots, each two  Ounces, of Scabious-roots and Elecampane-roots, each an Ounce and a half.  Ground-ivy, Hore-hound, Oak of Jerusalem, Lung-wort, Liver-wort,  Maiden-hair, Harts-tongue of each two good-handfulls. Licorish four Ounces.  Jujubes, Raisins of the Sun and Currents, of each two Ounces; let the roots  be sliced, and the herbs be broken a little with your hands; and boil all  these in twenty quarts of fair running water, or, if you have it, in Rain  water, with five Pints of good white honey, until one third part be boiled  away; then pour the liquor through a jelly bag often upon a little  Coriander-seeds, and Cinnamon; and when it runneth very clear, put it into  Bottles well stopped, and set it cool for your use, and drink every morning  a good draught of it, and at five in the afternoone.      TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN    Put to three Gallons of Spring-water, one of honey. First let it gently  melt; then boil for an hour, continually skiming it; then put it into an  earthen or a woodden vessel, and when it is a little more than Blood-warm,  set it with Ale-yest, and so let it stand twelve hours. Then take off the  yest, and bottle it up. Put into it Limon-peel and Cloves, or what best  pleaseth your taste of Spice or Herbs. Eringo-roots put into it, when it  is boiling, maketh it much "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16444"],[0,"Indian Unrest (#16)"],[1,"have sufficed in itself  to invest the Maharajah of Kolhapur with a certain measure of sanctity  in the eyes of Tilak and his followers. Far from it. His Highness is an  enlightened ruler and a man of great simplicity of character. He takes a  keen interest in the administration of his State, and has undertaken, at  no small cost to his Exchequer, one of the most important irrigation  works yet attempted in any Native State. But he committed what Tilak  and his friends regarded as two unforgivable offences: he fought against  the intolerance of the Brahmans and he is a faithful friend end ally of  the British _Raj_. Hence they set in motion against him, the descendant  of Shivaji, in his own State, exactly the same machinery of agitation  and conspiracy which they have set in motion against British rule in  British India.    It is a curious and most instructive story. There had been long  minorities in Kolhapur, and, especially during the more or less nominal  reign of the present Maharajah's predecessor, Shivaji IV., who  ultimately went mad, the Prime Minister, a Chitpavan Brahman of  Ratnagiri, acquired almost supreme power in the State, and filled every  important post with his fellow caste men, of whom he introduced more  than a hundred into the public service. Under Chitpavan rule the  interests of the people of the soil were systematically neglected in  Kolhapur, as they had been throughout the Deccan in the later days of  the Chitpavan theocracy at Poona, and privileges and possessions were  showered upon members of the favoured caste. On his accession in 1894  the present Maharajah appointed as his Prime Minister, with a view to  very necessary reforms in the administration, a Kayastha Prabhu, Rao  Bahadur Sabnis, who, though a high-caste Hindu, was not a Brahman. There  has long been great rivalry between the Brahmans and the Prabhus, who  belong mostly to the moderate progressive school of Hinduism. The  appointment of Mr. Sabnis, besides portending unpalatable reforms, was  therefore in itself very unwelcome to the Kolhapur Brahmans, amongst  whom one of the most influential, Mr. B.N. Joshi, the Chief Judge, was a  personal friend of Tilak. Consternation increased when the young  Maharajah announced his intention of promoting to positions of trust  such non-Brahmans as should be found capable of filling them and  actually started educating non-Brahmans for the purpose. In order to put  pressure upon their ruler, the Brahmans had recourse to one of the most  powerful weapons with which the semi-religious, semi-social structure of  Hinduism has armed them. They questioned his caste and refused to recite  at certain religious ceremonies in his family the Vedic hymns, to which  as a Kshatriya (i.e., as a member of the \"twice-born\" caste ranking  next to the Brahmans) his Highness claimed to be traditionally entitled.  The stalwart Brahmans of the Deccan allege, it seems, that in this _Kali  Yuga_, or Age of Darkness, there can be no Kshatriyas, since there is no  room or a warrior caste in the orthodox sense under an alien rule, and  that therefore the Hindus who are neither Brahmans nor pariahs can at  best be Shudras--a \"clean\" caste, but not even entitled to wear the  \"sacred thread\" reserved for the highest castes.    The Maharajah remained firm, for this insult, though aimed chiefly at  him, affected equally all high-caste Mahrattas who were not Brahmans. To  their credit be it said, several of the more progressive Brahmans,  braving the pressure of their fellow caste-men at Poona and in Kolhapur  itself, stood by his Highness. The dispute was aggravated when the  Rajpadhya--the family priest of the Kolhapur ruling family--himself  refused the Vedic ritual to his Highness, even when two Judges, both  Brahmans, who were appointed to form with him a committee of three to  decide the issue, pronounced in favour of the Maharajah's claim. His  Highness then took the case to the Sankeshwar Shankaracharya, the  highest religious authority with jurisdiction in such matters. But the  feud only grew the more bitter, as, owing to the death of the incumbent  of that high office, rival candidatures were put forward to the  succession by the Maharajah's supporters on the one hand and by Tilak  and his friends on the other. To the present day the feud continues, and  the present Shankaracharya is not recognized by the Poona school of  Brahmans. Nor is he likely to be, as he has had the unique courage  publicly to condemn as a Brahman the murder of Mr. Jackson by Brahmans.    I have already remarked with reference to the Nasik tragedy that, if  murder is a heinous crime by whomsoever committed, it ranks amongst  Hindus as specially heinous when committed by a Brahman; and I have  asked several Brahmans how it is that instead of outcasting the murderer  many Brahmans continue more or less secretly to glorify his crime. Some  have admitted that there is a strong case for the public excommunication  of Brahmans guilty of political murder, some have regretted that no such  action has ever been taken by the caste authorities, some have argued  that caste organization has been so loosened that any collective action  would be impracticable. Only in Kolhapur has a Brahman, qualified to  speak with the highest religious authority in the name of Hindu sacred  law, been found to have in this respect the courage of his convictions.  This Brahman was no less a personage than the Shankaracharya of the  Karveer Petha, who took the very noteworthy step of issuing a  proclamation solemnly reprobating the murder committed by a Brahman \"in  the holy city of Nasik\" as \"a stain on the Brahmanical religion of mercy  emphatically preached by Manu and other law-givers.\" After paying a warm  tribute to Mr. Jackson's personal qualities and great learning, and  quoting sacred texts to show that \"such a murder is to be condemned the  more when a Brahman commits it,\" and renders the murderer liable to the  most awful penalties in the next world, the proclamation proceeded to  declare that \"his Holiness is pleased to excommunicate the wicked  persons who have committed the present offence, and who shall commit  similar offences against the State, and none of the disciples of this  Petha shall have any dealings with such sinful men.\"    Amongst the majority of Brahmans in Kolhapur and elsewhere this  proclamation, I fear, found no echo, for their hostility towards their  own Maharajah had often assumed or encouraged criminal forms of  violence. It had certainly not remained confined to the spiritual  domain, and it became absolutely savage when, in 1902, his Highness  declared that he would reserve at least half the posts in the State for  qualified men of the non-Brahman communities. Under the constant  inspiration of Poona, the Tilak Press waged relentless war against his  Highness, preaching disaffection towards his Government, just as it  preached disaffection towards the British _Raj_; and the agitation in  Kolhapur itself was reinforced by the advent of a large number of Poona  Brahmans who, in consequence of a recrudescence of plague, fled from  that city to the Maharajah's capital. They flung themselves eagerly into  the fray, and had the audacity even to start a mock \"Parliament.\" But  the Maharajah was determined to be master in his own State, and in Mr.  Sabnis he had found a Prime Minister who loyally and courageously  carried out his policy for the improvement of the administration and the  spread of education amongst the non-Brahman castes. The Maharajah  realizes that Brahman ascendency cannot be broken down permanently  unless the non-Brahman castes are adequately equipped to compete with  them in the public services. Amongst these there is plenty of loyalty to  the ruling chief, for his Mahratta subjects have not wholly forgotten  the tyranny of Chitpavan Brahman rule either under Shivaji IV.'s Prime  Minister or in the less recent times of the Poona Peshwas. One of the  most interesting institutions in Kolhapur is a hostel specially endowed  for non-Brahman, Mahratta, Mahomedan, and Jain youths who are following  the courses of the Rajaram College. The control of education plays in  Kolhapur as conspicuous a part as at Poona in the struggle between the  forces of order and disorder, and it is amongst the Kolhapur youth that  the latter have made their most strenuous exertions and with the same  lawless results.    The first organization started at Kolhapur in imitation of Poona was a  Shivaji club, with which were associated bands of gymnasts, Ganpati  choirs, an anti-cow-killing society, &c., all on the lines of those  founded by Tilak. It was suppressed in 1900 as several of its members  had been implicated in the disturbances at Bir, where a young \"patriot\"  had proclaimed himself Rajah and collected a sufficient number of armed  followers to require a military force to suppress the rebellion. The  disturbances at Bir were, in fact, the starting point of that new form  of political propagandism which takes the shape of dacoities or armed  robberies for the benefit of the \"patriotic\" war-chest. After the  suppression of the Kolhapur Shivaji Club, many of its leading members  disappeared for a time, but only to carry on their operations in other  parts of India, where they entered into relations with secret societies  of a similar type. Three years later the club had been practically  revived under the new name of \"Belapur Swami Club,\" so called in honour  of the late Swami of Belapur, to whose wooden slippers the members of  the club were in the habit of doing worship, whilst his shrine was used  as a sanctuary for sedition-mongers and a store-house for illicit  weapons. \"Political\" dacoities were soon in vogue again, and in 1905  there was an epidemic of house-breaking in and around Kolhapur, which  enriched the club with several thousands of rupees and a few arms.
