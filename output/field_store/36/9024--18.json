After a careful view of the situation  he concluded to abandon Crown Point until the spring, when he could  easily occupy it again, and attack Ticonderoga with every prospect of  success. But Carleton, soon afterwards, was ordered to give up the  command of the royal troops to Burgoyne, who was instructed by Germaine  to proceed to the Hudson River, where Howe was to join him. Carleton  naturally resented the insult that he received and resigned the  governor-generalship, to which General Haldimand was appointed. Carleton  certainly brought Canada securely through one of the most critical  epochs of her history, and there is every reason to believe that he  would have saved the honour of England and the reputation of her  generals, had he rather than Burgoyne and Howe been entrusted with the  direction of her armies in North America.    Carleton's administration of the civil government of the province was  distinguished by a spirit of discretion and energy which deservedly  places him among the ablest governors who ever presided over the public  affairs of a colony. During the progress of the American war the  legislative council was not able to meet until nearly two years after  its abrupt adjournment in September, 1775. At this session, in 1777,  ordinances were passed for the establishment of courts of King's bench,  common pleas, and probate.    A critical perusal of the valuable documents, placed of late years in  the archives of the Dominion, clearly proves that it was a fortunate day  for Canada when so resolute a soldier and far-sighted administrator as  General Haldimand was in charge of the civil and military government of  the country after the departure of Carleton. His conduct appears to have  been dictated by a desire to do justice to all classes, and it is most  unfair to his memory to declare that he was antagonistic to French  Canadians. During the critical time when he was entrusted with the  public defence it is impossible to accuse him of an arrogant or  unwarrantable exercise of authority, even when he was sorely beset by  open and secret enemies of the British connection. The French Canadian  _habitant_ found himself treated with a generous consideration that he  never obtained during the French regime, and wherever his services were  required by the state, he was paid, not in worthless card money, but in  British coin. During Haldimand's administration the country was in a  perilous condition on account of the restlessness and uncertainty that  prevailed while the French naval and military expeditions were in  America, using every means of exciting a public sentiment hostile to  England and favourable to France among the French Canadians. Admiral  D'Estaing's proclamation in 1778 was a passionate appeal to the old  national sentiment of the people, and was distributed in every part of  the province. Dr. Kingsford believes that it had large influence in  creating a powerful feeling which might have seriously threatened  British dominion had the French been able to obtain permission from  congress to send an army into the country. Whatever may have been the  temper of the great majority of the French Canadians, it does not appear  that many of them openly expressed their sympathy with France, for whom  they would naturally still feel a deep love as their motherland. The  assertion that many priests secretly hoped for the appearance of the  French army is not justified by any substantial evidence except the fact  that one La Valiniere was arrested for his disloyalty, and sent a  prisoner to England. It appears, however, that this course was taken  with the approval of the bishop himself, who was a sincere friend of the  English connection throughout the war. Haldimand arrested a number of  persons who were believed to be engaged in treasonable practices against  England, and effectively prevented any successful movement being made by  the supporters of the revolutionists, or sympathisers with France, whose  emissaries were secretly working in the parishes.    Haldimand's principal opponent during these troublous times was one  Pierre du Calvet, an unscrupulous and able intriguer, whom he imprisoned  on the strong suspicion of treasonable practices; but the evidence  against Calvet at that time appears to have been inadequate, as he  succeeded in obtaining damages against the governor-general in an  English court. The imperial government, however, in view of all the  circumstances brought to their notice, paid the cost of the defence of  the suit. History now fully justifies the action of Haldimand, for the  publication of Franklin's correspondence in these later times shows that  Calvet--who was drowned at sea and never again appeared in Canada--was  in direct correspondence with congress, and the recognised emissary of  the revolutionists at the very time he was declaring himself devoted to  the continuance of British rule in Canada.    Leaving the valley of the St. Lawrence, and reviewing the conditions of  affairs in the maritime provinces, during the American revolution, we  see that some of the settlers from New England sympathised with their  rebellious countrymen. The people of Truro, Onslow, and Londonderry,  with the exception of five persons, refused to take the oath of  allegiance, and were not allowed for some time to be represented in the  legislature. The assembly was always loyal to the crown, and refused to  consider the appeals that were made to it by circular letters, and  otherwise, to give active aid and sympathy to the rebellious colonies  During the war armed cruisers pillaged the small settlements at  Charlottetown, Annapolis, Lunenburg, and the entrance of the St. John  River. One expedition fitted out at Machias, in the present state of  Maine, under the command of a Colonel Eddy, who had been a resident of  Cumberland, attempted to seize Fort Cumberland--known as Beausejour in  French Acadian days--at the mouth of the Missiquash. In this section of  the country there were many sympathisers with the rebels, and Eddy  expected to have an easy triumph. The military authorities were happily  on the alert, and the only result was the arrest of a number of persons  on the suspicion of treasonable designs. The inhabitants of the county  of Yarmouth--a district especially exposed to attack--only escaped the  frequent visits of privateers by secret negotiations with influential  persons in Massachusetts. The settlers on the St. John River, at  Maugerville, took measures to assist their fellow-countrymen in New  England, but the defeat of the Cumberland expedition and the activity of  the British authorities prevented the disaffected in Sunbury county--in  which the original settlements of New Brunswick were then  comprised--from rendering any practical aid to the revolutionists. The  authorities at Halifax authorised the fitting out of privateers in  retaliation for the damages inflicted on western ports by the same class  of cruisers sailing from New England. The province was generally  impoverished by the impossibility of carrying on the coasting trade and  fisheries with security in these circumstances. The constant demand for  men to fill the army and the fleet drained the country when labour was  imperatively needed for necessary industrial pursuits, including the  cultivation of the land. Some Halifax merchants and traders alone found  profit in the constant arrival of troops and ships. Apart, however, from  the signs of disaffection shown in the few localities I have mentioned,  the people generally appear to have been loyal to England, and rallied,  notably in the townships of Annapolis, Horton and Windsor, to the  defence of the country, at the call of the authorities.    In 1783 the humiliated king of England consented to a peace with his old  colonies, who owed their success not so much to the unselfishness and  determination of the great body of the rebels as to the incapacity of  British generals and to the patience, calmness, and resolution of the  one great man of the revolution, George Washington. I shall in a later  chapter refer to this treaty in which the boundaries between Canada and  the new republic were so ignorantly and clumsily defined that it took  half a century and longer to settle the vexed questions that arose in  connection with territorial rights, and then the settlement was to the  injury of Canada. So far as the treaty affected the Provinces its most  important result was the forced migration of that large body of people  who had remained faithful to the crown and empire during the revolution.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING BOUNDARY BETWEEN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES  BY TREATY OF 1783]      SECTION 3.--The United Empire Loyalists    John Adams and other authorities in the United States have admitted that  when the first shot of the revolution was fired by \"the embattled  farmers\" of Concord and Lexington, the Loyalists numbered one-third of  the whole population of the colonies, or seven hundred thousand whites.  Others believe that the number was larger, and that the revolutionary  party was in a minority even after the declaration of independence. The  greater number of the Loyalists were to be found in the present state of  New York, where the capital was in possession of the British from  September, 1776, until the evacuation in 1783. They were also the  majority in Pennsylvania and the southern colonies of South Carolina and  Georgia. In all the other states they represented a large minority of  the best class of their respective communities. It is estimated that  there were actually from thirty to thirty-five thousand, at one time or  other, enrolled in regularly organised corps, without including the  bodies which waged guerilla warfare in South Carolina and elsewhere.    It is only within a decade of years that some historical writers in the  United"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12667"],[0,"Travels of Richard and John Lander into the interior of Africa, for the (#16)"],[1,"dition, that the blacksmith, who was an inhabitant of a distant  kingdom, and entirely unconnected with him, should be allowed to stay  at Joag until his return. To this they all objected, and insisted  that as all had acted contrary to the laws, all were equally  answerable for their transgressions.    Their landlord strenuously advised Mr. Park not to go to the king,  who, he said, if he discovered any thing valuable in his possession,  would seize it without ceremony. In consequence of this  representation, Mr. Park was the more solicitous to conciliate  matters with the king's officers, and acknowledged that he had indeed  entered the king's frontiers, without knowing that he was to pay the  duties beforehand, but was ready to pay them then; accordingly he  tendered, as a present to the king, the drachms of gold, which he had  received from the king of Bondou; this they accepted, but insisted on  examining his baggage. The bundles were opened, but the men were  greatly disappointed in not finding much gold and amber: they made up  the deficiency, however, by taking whatever things they fancied, and  departed, having first robbed him of half his goods. These  proceedings tended, in a great degree, to dispirit the attendants of  Mr. Park. Madiboo begged of him to return; Johnson laughed at the  thoughts of proceeding without money, and the blacksmith was afraid  to be seen, or even to speak, lest any one should discover him to be  a native of Kasson. In this dejected state of mind, they passed the  night by the side of a dim fire.    In the course of the following day Mr. Park was informed, that a  nephew of Demba Sego Jalla, the Mandingo king of Kasson, was coming  to visit him. The prince had been sent out on a mission to Batcheri,  king of Kajaaga, to endeavour to settle some disputes between his  uncle and the latter, in which, having been unsuccessful, he was on  his return to Kasson, to which place he offered to conduct Mr. Park,  provided he would set out on the following morning.    Mr. Park gratefully accepted this offer, and, with his attendants,  was ready to set out by daylight on the 27th of December. The retinue  of Demba Sego was numerous, the whole amounting, on the departure  from Joag, to thirty persons and six loaded asses. Having proceeded  for some hours, they came to a tree, for which Johnson had made  frequent inquiry, and here, having desired them to stop, he produced  a white chicken he had purchased at Joag for the purpose, and tied it  by the leg to one of the branches; he then declared they might now  proceed without fear, for their journey would be prosperous. This  circumstance exhibits the power of superstition over the minds of the  negroes, for although this man had resided seven years in England, he  retained all the prejudices imbibed in his youth. He meant this  ceremony, he told Mr. Park, as an offering to the spirits of the  wood, who were a powerful race of beings, of a white colour, with  long flowing hair.    At noon the travellers stopped at Gungadi, where was a mosque built  of clay, with six turrets, on the pinnacles of which were placed six  ostrich eggs. Towards evening they arrived at Samee a town on the  banks of the Senegal, which is here a beautiful but shallow river,  its banks high, and covered with verdure.    On the following day they proceeded to Kajee, a large village, part  of which is on the north, and part on the south side of the river.  About sunset Mr. Park and Demba Sego embarked in the canoe, which the  least motion was likely to overset, and Demba Sego thinking this a  proper time to examine a tin box belonging to Mr. Park, that stood in  the fore part of the canoe, by stretching out his hand for it,  destroyed the equilibrium and overset the vessel. As they were not  far advanced, they got back to the shore without much difficulty, and  after wringing the water from their clothes, took a fresh departure,  and were safely landed in Kasson.    Demba Sego now told Mr. Park, that they were in his uncle's  dominions, and he hoped that he would consider the obligation he owed  to him, and make him a suitable return by a handsome present. This  proposition was rather unexpected by Mr. Park, who began to fear that  he had not much improved his condition by crossing the water, but as  it would have been folly to complain, he gave the prince seven bars  of amber and some tobacco, with which he seemed well satisfied.    In the evening of December the 29th, they arrived at Demba Sego's  hut, and the next morning Mr. Park was introduced by the prince to  his father, Tigitty Sego, brother to the king of Kasson, chief of  Tesee. The old man viewed his visitor with great earnestness, having  never beheld but one white man before, whom Mr. Park discovered to be  Major Houghton. He appeared to disbelieve what Mr. Park asserted, in  answer to his inquiries concerning the motives that induced him to  explore the country, and told him that he must go to Kooniakary to  pay his respects to the king, but desired to see him again before he  left Tesee.    Tesee is a large unwalled town, fortified only by a sort of citadel,  in which Tiggity Sego and his family reside. The present inhabitants,  though possessing abundance of cattle and corn, eat without scruple  rats, moles, squirrels, snakes, locusts, &c. The attendants of Mr.  Park were one evening invited to a feast, where making a hearty meal  of what they thought to be fish and kouskous, one of them found a  piece of hard skin in the dish, which he brought away with him, to  show Mr. Park what sort of fish they had been eating. On examining  the skin, it was discovered they had been feasting on a large snake.  Another custom, which is rigidly adhered to, is, that no woman is  allowed to eat an egg, and nothing will more affront a woman of Tesee  than to offer her an egg. The men, however, eat eggs without scruple.    The following anecdote will show, that in some particulars the  African and European women have a great resemblance to each other,  and that conjugal infidelity is by no means confined to the latter. A  young man, a kafir of considerable affluence, who had recently  married a young and handsome wife, applied to a very devout Bushreen  or Mussulman priest of his acquaintance, to procure him saphies for  his protection during the approaching war. The Bushreen complied with  his request, and to render the saphies more efficacious, enjoined the  young man to avoid any nuptial intercourse with his bride for the  space of six weeks. The kafir obeyed, and without telling his wife  the real cause, absented himself from her company. In the mean time  it was whispered that the Bushreen, who always performed his evening  devotions at the door of the kafir's hut, was more intimate with the  young wife, than was consistent with virtue, or the sanctity of his  profession. The husband was unwilling to suspect the honour of his  sanctified friend, whose outward show of religion, as is the case  with the priests and parsons of the civilized part of the world,  protected him from even the suspicion of so flagitious an act. Some  time, however, elapsed before any jealousy arose in the mind of the  husband, but hearing the charge repeated, he interrogated his wife on  the subject, who confessed that the holy man had seduced her.  Hereupon the kafir put her into confinement, and called a palaver on  the Bushreen's conduct, which Mr. Park was invited to attend. The  fact was proved against the priest, and he was sentenced to be sold  into slavery, or find two slaves for his redemption, according to the  pleasure of the complainant. The injured husband, however, desired  rather to have him publicly flogged, before Tiggity Sego's gate; this  was agreed to, and the sentence immediately carried into execution.  The culprit was tied by the hands to a strong stake, and the  executioner with a long black rod round his head, for some time  applied it with such dexterity to the Bushreen's back, as to make him  roar until the woods resounded. The multitude, by their looking and  laughing, manifested how much they enjoyed the punishment of the old  gallant, and it is remarkable, that the number of stripes was exactly  the same as enjoined by the Mosaic law, _forty, save one._    On the 8th of January, Demba Sego, who had borrowed Mr. Park's horse,  for the purpose of making a small excursion into the country,  returned and informed his father, that he should set out for  Kooniakary early the next day. The old man made many frivolous  objections, and gave Mr. Park to understand, that he must not depart  without paying him the duties to which he was entitled from all  travellers; besides which, he expected some acknowledgment for his  kindness towards him. Accordingly, the following morning Demba Sego,  with a number of people, came to Mr. Park, to see what goods he  intended as a present to the old chief. Mr. Park offered them seven  bars of amber, and five of tobacco, but Demba, having surveyed these  articles, very coolly told him they were not a present suitable to a  man of Tiggity Sego's consequence, and if he did not make him a  larger offering, he would carry all the baggage to his father, and  let him choose for himself. Without waiting for a reply, Demba and  his attendants immediately opened the bundles, and spread the  different articles upon the floor; everything that pleased them they  took without a scruple, and Demba in particular seized the tin box,  which had so much attracted his attention in crossing the river. Upon  collecting the remains of his little fortune, after these people had  left him, Mr. Park found, that as at Joag, he had been plundered of  half, so he was here deprived of half the remainder. Having been  under some obligations to Demba Sego, Mr. Park did not reproach him  for his rapacity, but determined at all events to quit Tesee the  following morning; in the mean while, to raise the drooping"]]]
