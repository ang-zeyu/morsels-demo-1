Every line of  these letters indicates a tussle between a natural tendency to frank  honesty and an unnatural and unworthy method of deception. Obviously,  the recipient of this precious document would have her curiosity  excited over the disingenuous tale of romance. She would ask herself  first of all, \"Why should my kinsman be so desirous to tell me that  the orphan in whom he has so fond an interest is not without a  fortune? and why should the responsibility of rearing and educating  the child have been entrusted to him, the most active and important  Admiral in the British Navy? And if it be true that she is an orphan,  surely there could be no object in supposing that any one would  '_curse_ her,' especially as he declared that she was 'not without  fortune,' and that she was to be known as his adopted child.\" The  niece, being a quick-witted girl, would naturally think the problem  out for herself, and decide that there was something fishy involved  in the mystery of these unnecessary phrases.    In dealing with his domestic complications, Nelson's mind seems to  have been in a constant whirlwind, dodging from one difficulty into  another, never direct, and for ever in conflict with his true self. He  was brave and resourceful in everything that appertained to the  service he adorned, and yet a shivering fear came over him now and  again lest the truth concerning his attachment to his friend's wife  should be revealed. When he was seized with these remorseful thoughts,  he could not be silent; he was not possessed of the constitutional  gift of reticence, and could only find relief by constant reference to  the matter he wished kept secret in such a way as to cause people to  put two and two together and arrive at the very truth he wished to  hide.      VII    But whatever his ruling passion may have been, his belief in the Power  that rules us all never forsook him. He believed in religious forms as  of a spiritual force. He often committed himself to it, and claimed  the privilege of asking for Heaven's guidance. Call it eccentricity or  superstition, or what you like, but to him it was a reality. One of  the many amusing instances of his devotion to religious rites was the  occasion when he and Lady Hamilton stood as godfather and godmother  at the christening of their daughter, Horatia Nelson Thompson,[7] by  which name she was baptized. To the puritanic, orthodox mind (keeping  in view all the circumstances of parentage) this will be looked upon  as an act of abominable hypocrisy and sacrilege, but to him it was a  pious duty.    Like all highly strung and overwrought mortals, he was often moody,  depressed, and, worst of all, a victim to premonitions of his early  demise. His superstitious temperament was constantly worrying him, as  did his faith in the predictions of a gipsy fortune-teller who had  correctly described his career up to the year 1805, and then stopping  had said, \"I can see no further.\" This creepy ending of the gipsy's  tale was afflicting him with a dumb pain and depression when he  unexpectedly came across his sister Catherine in London. She referred  to his worn, haggard look with a tenderness that was peculiarly her  own. He replied, \"Ah! Katty! Katty! that gipsy!\" and then relapsed  into morbid silence. The foreboding bore heavily on his mind, and the  story may well make one's heart throb with pity for the noble fellow  who was so soon to fulfil his tragic destiny. Well may we exclaim that  fame seems to be the most wretched of mockeries!    The Duke of Wellington, of whom it is said no dose of flattery was too  strong for him to swallow, has left on record an interesting account  of his meeting Nelson at the Colonial Office. He gives the account of  it, thirty years after Nelson's death, to John Wilson Croker at  Walmer, and here is what he says of Collingwood's great comrade:--        WALMER, _1st October, 1834_.        We were [that is, Croker and he] talking of Lord Nelson, and      some instances were mentioned of the egotism and vanity that      derogated from his character. \"Why,\" said the Duke, \"I am not      surprised at such instances, for Lord Nelson was, in different      circumstances, two quite different men, as I myself can vouch,      though I only saw him once in my life, and for, perhaps, an      hour. It was soon after I returned from India. I went to the      Colonial Office in Downing Street, and there I was shown into      the little waiting-room on the right hand, where I found, also      waiting to see the Secretary of State, a gentleman, whom, from      his likeness to his pictures and the loss of an arm, I      immediately recognized as Lord Nelson. He could not know who I      was, but he entered at once into conversation with me, if I can      call it conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all      about himself, and in, really, a style so vain and so silly as      to surprise and almost disgust me. I suppose something that I      happened to say made him guess that I was _somebody_, and he      went out of the room for a moment, I have no doubt to ask the      office keeper who I was, for when he came back he was altogether      a different man, both in manner and matter. All that I had      thought a charlatan style had vanished, and he talked of the      state of this country and the probabilities of affairs on the      Continent with a good sense, and a knowledge of subjects both at      home and abroad, that surprised me equally and more agreeably      than the first part of our interview had done; in fact, he      talked like an officer and a statesman. The Secretary of State      kept us long waiting, and certainly, for the last half or      three-quarters of an hour, I don't know that I ever had a      conversation that interested me more. Now, if the Secretary of      State had been punctual, and admitted Lord Nelson in the first      quarter of an hour, I should have had the same impression of a      light and trivial character that other people have had; but      luckily I saw enough to be satisfied that he was really a very      superior man; but certainly a more sudden and complete      metamorphosis I never saw.\"[8]    We must not be too critical of the Duke's opinions of the vanity of  the Admiral, but it calls for some notice, inasmuch as the Duke  himself is reputed to have had an uncommonly good amount of it  himself, though it took a different form and created a different  impression. Wellington showed it in a cold, haughty, unimaginative,  repelling self-importance; fearful of unbending to his inferiors lest  his dignity should be offended. Nelson's peculiarities were the very  antithesis; it was his delightful egotism and vanity that added to his  charm and made him such a fascinating personality. His direct  slap-dash, unconventional phrases and flashes of naval brilliancy,  whether in search of, or engaged in battle with the enemy, together  with a natural kindness to his officers and men of all ranks, filled  them with confidence and pride in having him as their chief. The  \"Nelson touch,\" the \"drubbing\" he swore in his own engaging way that  Mr. Villeneuve--as he called him to Blackwood--was to have when he  caught him, the putting of the telescope to his blind eye at  Copenhagen when the signal was flying to leave off action, and then  \"No, damn me if I do,\" had an inspiring effect on his men and  strengthened the belief in his dauntlessness and sagacity. \"What will  Nelson think of us?\" remarked one of the men aboard one of the  frigates that obeyed the signal. But Nelson went on fighting with  complete success. \"Luckily,\" says Wellington, \"I saw enough to be  satisfied that he was really a very superior man.\" Why \"luckily\"? What  difference would his lack of knowledge have made? The Duke was hardly  the type of man to understand the powerful personality whose style,  \"so vain and silly, surprised and almost disgusted\" him. That view  does not stand to _his_ credit, and no one else held it.    But let us see what a greater man than either Wellington or Nelson  says of both. Napoleon, at St. Helena, spoke in very high terms of  Lord Nelson,[9] and indeed attempted to palliate that one stigma on  his memory, the execution of Carraciolli, which he attributed entirely  to his having been deceived by that wicked woman Queen Caroline,  through Lady Hamilton, and to the influence which the latter had over  him. He says of the Duke: \"Judging from Wellington's actions, from his  dispatches, and, above all, from his conduct towards Ney, I should  pronounce him to be a poor-spirited man, without generosity, and  without greatness of soul ('Un homme de peu d'esprit, sans generosite,  et sans grandeur d'ame'). Such I know to be the opinion of Benjamin  Constant and of Madame de Stael, who said that, except as a general,  he had not two ideas. As a general, however, to find his equal amongst  your own nation, you must go back to the time of Marlborough, but as  anything else, I think that history will pronounce him to be a man of  limited capacity ('Un homme borne').\"[10]    \"Nelson is a brave man. If Villeneuve at Aboukir and Dumanoir at  Trafalgar had had a little of his blood, the French would have been  conquerors. I ought to have had Dumanoir's head cut off. Do you not  think more highly of Nelson than of the best engineers who construct  fortifications? Nelson had what a mere engineer officer can never  acquire. It is a gift of nature.\"    The Emperor, in his eulogy of Nelson, is not unmindful of the terrible  crime he was led to commit at the instigation of that human viper,  Queen Caroline, and the licentious Emma Hamilton. He, to some extent,  whittles down Nelson's share of the responsibility by putting the  whole blame on them. But who can read the gruesome story of the trial  and hanging of the aged Prince Carraciolli without feeling ashamed  that a fellow-countryman in Nelson's position"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15319"],[0,"The Government Class Book (#16)"],[1," the territory from which these states have been formed was  yet the property of the United States, and uninhabited, Congress passed  an act by which a particular section of land (number sixteen) in every  township is reserved for the support of schools therein. By this act,  one thirty-sixth part of the lands within each of these states has been  thus appropriated, besides smaller portions granted for the benefit of a  university in each state. These lands are in the charge of proper  officers, who dispose of them, and apply the proceeds as the law  directs.    Sec.7. The school funds of many of the states have been largely increased  by certain moneys received from the United States. In 1837, there had  accumulated in the national treasury about thirty millions of dollars  over and above what was needed for the support of the government. By an  act of congress, this surplus revenue was distributed among the states  then existing, to be kept by them until called for by congress. Although  congress reserved the right to recall the money, it was presumed that it  would never be demanded. That it never will be, is now almost certain.  Many of the states have appropriated large portions of their respective  shares for school purposes. From its having been said to be only  _deposited_ with the states, this fund is sometimes called the _United  States deposit fund_.    Sec.8. School moneys coming from the state treasury, or state fund, are  usually apportioned among the several towns of the state; and each  town's share of such moneys, together with what may come to the town by  taxation or from its school lands, is divided among the several  districts according to the number of children between certain ages in  each district, or in such other manner as may be directed by law. If the  moneys thus received are insufficient to pay the wages of teachers, a  rate bill is made out in each district for the deficiency, and collected  from the persons whose children have been taught in the schools.    Sec.9. The towns, or townships, are divided into districts of suitable size  for schools, which are called _district schools_. From their being  supported by a common fund, and designed for the common benefit, or from  the lower or more common branches being taught in them, they are also  called _common schools_. One or more _trustees_ or _directors_ are  chosen in each district to manage its affairs; a _clerk_ to notify  meetings and record the proceedings of the same; and a _collector_ to  collect taxes for building and repairing school-houses, and all rate  bills for the payment of teachers.    Sec.10. The highest school officer is the _state superintendent of common  schools_, or, as he is sometimes called, _superintendent of public  instruction_. The superintendent collects information relating to the  schools; the number of children residing in each district, and the  number taught; the amount paid for tuition; the number of school-houses,  and the amount yearly expended in erecting school-houses; and other  matters concerning the operation and effects of the common school  system. If there is no other officer whose duty it is, the  superintendent also apportions the money arising from the state funds  among the several counties. He reports to the legislature at every  session the information he has collected, and suggests such improvements  in the school system as he thinks ought to be made.    Sec.11. There is in every county an officer who receives from the state  superintendent the money apportioned to the county, and apportions the  same among the towns; reports to the state superintendent the number of  children in the county; and performs such other duties as the law  requires. In some states, there is no such county officer; but the money  is apportioned by the state superintendent among the towns; and the  reports from the towns are made directly to the state superintendent.    Sec.12. In the towns are officers whose duties are to examine teachers,  visit schools, apportion the school moneys among the districts, and to  collect the lists of the number of children in the several districts,  with such other information as the law requires, and report the same to  the county officer, or, if there is none, to the state superintendent.  In some states, there is in each county an officer or a board of  officers, for examining teachers, and performing certain other duties  relating to the schools of the county.    Sec.13. Academies and colleges also receive aid from the state, to a  limited extent. A distinct fund is created in some states for their  benefit; in others, they are aided by special appropriations from the  state treasury.          Chapter XXIII.    Canals and Rail-Roads.        Sec.1. In carrying out the purposes of government, provision ought also to  be made to secure to the people the means of obtaining a suitable reward  for their industry, and to render the labor of all, as nearly as may be,  equally profitable.    Sec.2. The people of some states do not possess the same advantage as those  of others; nor do all the people of the same state enjoy equal  advantages. Those who reside at a great distance from market, or from  navigable waters and good roads, are not so well rewarded for their  labor as those who reside near them, because of the greater cost of the  transportation, both of what they have to sell, and of the goods they  buy. Hence the necessity of good roads, canals, or other means of  facilitating trade between the different parts of the state.    Sec.3. Among the works intended to effect this object, _canals_ are perhaps  the most useful, and are to be preferred wherever their construction is  practicable. Canals are sometimes constructed by incorporated companies;  but generally these works, especially those of great magnitude, are made  by the state, and are the property of the state. Although there are some  states in which are no canals of this kind, it may be interesting to  young persons generally to know how so important a state work is made.    Sec.4. To raise the money necessary to make a canal, the legislature might  levy a general tax upon the property of the citizens. But this would not  be expedient or just; because, first, the payment of so large a sum by  the people within the time in which it would be desirable to complete  the work, would be inconvenient and burdensome; and secondly, the  expense must fall alike upon the people of all parts of the state:  whereas, those residing most remotely from the line of the work, would  derive from it little or no benefit.    Sec.5. When, therefore, a great enterprise of this kind is undertaken by a  state, the law authorizing the work usually provides a _fund_, the  income of which is to be applied to this object. This fund consists of  such lands, property, and moneys as the legislature may grant for this  purpose. Funds were thus constituted in some of the western states, to  which funds congress made grants of the public lands of the United  States lying within those states.    Sec.6. These funds, however, furnish but a part, some of them but a small  portion of the money necessary to complete the work; and some states  undertaking public improvements may not have the lands or other property  to constitute such a fund. The state therefore borrows the money for a  long term of years, and depends upon the income of the canal fund and  the tolls to be collected on the canals, for the repayment of the money  borrowed. Should the revenues of the canal and of the canal fund be  insufficient, the deficiency may be supplied by taxation.    Sec.7. The business of borrowing the money is done on the part of the  state, by persons duly authorized, who give for the money borrowed the  bonds of the state, which are written promises to pay the money at the  times specified, with interest at the rate agreed on; the interest  generally to be paid semi-annually. These bonds are usually given in  sums of $1,000 each, or less. The debts of a state thus contracted by  issuing bonds, are called _state stocks_, as the capital, or stock  required to construct a state work is obtained by the sale of its bonds.  These bonds, like the certificates of stock in a rail-road or other  corporate business company, are transferable, and may be bought and sold  as promissory notes, and constitute an important article of trade.    Sec.8. These stocks are taken by men who have large sums of money to lend,  and who consider the state a responsible debtor; because, if it has no  other sufficient means of paying its bonds, the legislature has power to  raise the money by taxation. Most of the states have contracted debts in  this manner for various purposes. State stocks are purchased and held  not only by capitalists in this country, but by many in Europe.    Sec.9. Officers are appointed to manage the canal fund, and others to  superintend the canals. There are also officers, called _canal  collectors_, at suitable distances along the canals, to collect the  _tolls_, which are charges paid by the masters or owners of boats for  the use of the canal.    Sec.10. The states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and some other western  states, have prosecuted the canal enterprise on a large scale. Although  large debts have been contracted for the construction of canals in these  states, the benefits derived from them more than compensate for the vast  expense of their construction.    Sec.11. _Rail-roads_, although they are of public utility, are not  properly public works, being constructed by companies incorporated for  that purpose. The necessity for an act of incorporation is readily seen.  Rail-roads pass through the lands of private individuals; and without  the authority of law, the land of no person can be taken for such  purpose; nor can a law authorize it to be taken, unless the work is one  of general advantage; nor even in such case, without compensation to "]]]
