Rhys considers that Derbforgaill      was really a goddess of dawn and dusk, \"the drop glistening in      the sun's rays,\" as indicated by her name, which means a drop or      tear. (J. Rhys, _Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as      Illustrated by Celtic Heathendom_, p. 466.) It is interesting to      compare the legend of Derbforgaill with a somewhat more modern      Picardy folk-lore _conte_ which is clearly analogous but no      longer seems to show any mythologic element, \"La Princesse qui      pisse par dessus les Meules.\" This princess had a habit of      urinating over hay-cocks; the king, her father, in order to break      her of the habit, offered her in marriage to anyone who could      make a hay-cock so high that she could not urinate over it. The      young men came, but the princess would merely laugh and at once      achieve the task. At last there came a young man who argued with      himself that she would not be able to perform this feat after she      had lost her virginity. He therefore seduced her first and she      then failed ignobly, merely wetting her stockings. Accordingly,      she became his bride. (Kryptadia, vol. i. p. 333.) Such legends,      which have lost any mythologic elements they may originally have      possessed and have become merely _contes_, are not uncommon in      the folk-lore of many countries. But in their earlier more      religious forms and in their later more obscene forms, they alike      bear witness to the large place which scatalogic conceptions play      in the primitive mind.    It is a notable fact in evidence of the close and seemingly normal  association with the sexual impulse of the scatalogic processes, that an  interest in them, arising naturally and spontaneously, is one of the most  frequent channels by which the sexual impulse first manifests itself in  young boys and girls.        Stanley Hall, who has made special inquiries into the matter,      remarks that in childhood the products of excretion by bladder      and bowels are often objects of interest hardly less intense for      a time than eating and drinking. (\"Early Sense of Self,\"      _American Journal of Psychology_, April, 1898, p. 361.)      \"Micturitional obscenities,\" the same writer observes again,      \"which our returns show to be so common before adolescence,      culminate at 10 or 12, and seem to retreat into the background as      sex phenomena appear.\" They are, he remarks, of two classes:      \"Fouling persons or things, secretly from adults, but openly with      each other,\" and less often \"ceremonial acts connected with the      act or the product that almost suggest the scatalogical rites of      savages, unfit for description here, but of great interest and      importance.\" (G. Stanley Hall, _Adolescence_, vol. i, p. 116.)      The nature of such scatalogical phenomena in childhood--which are      often clearly the instinctive manifestations of an erotic      symbolism--and their wide prevalence among both boys and girls,      are very well illustrated in a narrative which I include in      Appendix B, History II.    In boys as they approach the age of puberty, this attraction to the  scatalogic, when it exists, tends to die out, giving place to more normal  sexual conceptions, or at all events it takes a subordinate and less  serious place in the mind. In girls, on the other hand, it often tends to  persist. Edmond de Goncourt, a minute observer of the feminine mind,  refers in _Cherie_ to \"those innocent and triumphant gaieties which  scatalogic stories have the privilege of arousing in women who have  remained still children, even the most distinguished women.\" The extent to  which innocent young women, who would frequently be uninterested or  repelled in presence of the sexually obscene are sometimes attracted by  the scatalogically obscene, becomes intelligible, however, if we realize  that a symbolism comes here into play. In women the more specifically  sexual knowledge and experience of life frequently develop much later than  in men or even remains in abeyance, and the specifically sexual phenomena  cannot therefore easily lend themselves to wit, or humor, or imagination.  But the scatalogic sphere, by the very fact that in women it is a  specially intimate and secret region which is yet always liable to be  unexpectedly protruded into consciousness, furnishes an inexhaustible  field for situations which have the same character as those furnished by  the sexually obscene. It thus happens that the sexually obscene which in  men tends to overshadow the scatalogically obscene, in women--partly from  inexperience and partly, it is probable, from their almost physiological  modesty--plays a part subordinate to the scatalogical. In a somewhat  analogous way scatalogical wit and humor play a considerable part in the  work of various eminent authors who were clergymen or priests.    In addition to the anatomical and psychological associations which  contribute to furnish a basis on which erotic symbolisms may spring up,  there are also physiological connections between the genital and urinary  spheres which directly favor such symbolisms. In discussing the analysis  of the sexual impulse in a previous volume of these _Studies_, I have  pointed out the remarkable relationship--sometimes of transference,  sometimes of compensation--which exists between genital tension and  vesical tension, both in men and women. In the histories of normal sexual  development brought together at the end of that and subsequent volumes the  relationship may frequently be traced, as also in the case of C.P. in the  present study (p. 37). Vesical power is also commonly believed to be in  relation with sexual potency, and the inability to project the urinary  stream in a normal manner is one of the accepted signs of sexual  impotency.[26] Fere, again, has recorded the history of a man with  periodic crises of sexual desire, and subsequently sexual obsession  without desire, which were always accompanied by the impulse to urinate  and by increased urination.[27] In the case, recorded by Pitres and Regis,  of a young girl who, having once at the sight of a young man she liked in  a theater been overcome by sexual feeling accompanied by a strong desire  to urinate, was afterward tormented by a groundless fear of experiencing  an irresistible desire to urinate at inconvenient times,[28] we have an  example of what may be called a physiological scatalogic symbolism of sex,  an emotion which was primarily erotic becoming transferred to the bladder  and then remaining persistent. From such a physiological symbolism it is  but a step to the psychological symbolisms of scatalogic fetichism.        It is worthy of note, as an indication that such phenomena are      scarcely abnormal, that a urinary symbolism, and even a strictly      sexual fetichism, are normal among many animals.        The most familiar example of this kind is furnished by the dog,      who is sexually excited in this manner by traces of the bitch and      himself takes every opportunity of making his own path      recognizable. \"This custom,\" Espinas remarks (_Des Societes      Animales_, p. 228), \"has no other aim than to spread along the      road recognizable traces of their presence for the benefit of      individuals of the other sex, the odor of these traces doubtless      causing excitement.\"        It is noteworthy, also, that in animals as well as in man, sexual      excitement may manifest itself in the bladder. Thus Daumas states      (_Chevaux de Sahara_, p. 49) that if the mare urinates when she      hears the stallion neigh it is a sign that she is ready for      connection.    It is in masochism, or passive algolagnia, that we may most frequently  find scatalogic symbolism in its fully developed form. The man whose  predominant impulse is to subjugate himself to his mistress and to receive  at her hands the utmost humiliation, frequently finds the climax of his  gratification in being urinated on by her, whether in actual fact or only  in imagination.    In many such cases, however, it is evident that we have a mixed  phenomenon; the symbolism is double. The act becomes desirable because it  is the outward and visible sign of an inwardly experienced abject slavery  to an adored person. But it is also desirable because of intimately sexual  associations in the act itself, as a symbolical detumescence, a simulacrum  of the sexual act, and one which proceeds from the sexual focus itself.        Krafft-Ebing records various cases of masochism in which the      emission of urine on to the body or into the mouth formed the      climax of sexual gratification, as, for instance (_Psychopathia      Sexualis_, English translation, p. 183) in the case of a Russian      official who as a boy had fancies of being bound between the      thighs of a woman, compelled to sleep beneath her nates and to      drink her urine, and in later life experienced the greatest      excitement when practicing the last part of this early      imagination.        In another case, recorded by Krafft-Ebing and by him termed      \"ideal masochism\" (_Op. cit._, pp. 127-130), the subject from      childhood indulged in voluptuous day-dreams in which he was the      slave of a beautiful mistress who would compel him to obey all      her caprices, stand over him with one foot on his breast, sit on      his face and body, make him wait on her in her bath, or when she      urinated, and sometimes insist on doing this on his face; though      a highly intellectual man, he was always too timid to attempt to      carry any of his ideas into execution; he had been troubled by      nocturnal enuresis up to the age of 20.        Neri, again (_Archivio delle Psicopatie Sessuali_, vol. i, fasc.      7 and 8, 1896), records the case of an Italian masochist who      experienced the greatest pleasure when both urination and      defecation were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13615"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 6 (#16)"],[1," learning something that must be divine.\" In the same      way, Edward Carpenter, stating that it is easy and natural for      the child to learn from the first its physical relation to its      mother, remarks (_Love's Coming of Age_, p. 9): \"A child at the      age of puberty, with the unfolding of its far-down emotional and      sexual nature, is eminently capable of the most sensitive,      affectional and serene appreciation of what _sex_ means      (generally more so as things are to-day, than its worldling      parent or guardian); and can absorb the teaching, if      sympathetically given, without any shock or disturbance to its      sense of shame--that sense which is so natural and valuable a      safeguard of early youth.\"        How widespread, even some years ago, had become the conviction      that the sexual facts of life should be taught to girls as well      as boys, was shown when the opinions of a very miscellaneous      assortment of more or less prominent persons were sought on the      question (\"The Tree of Knowledge,\" _New Review_, June, 1894). A      small minority of two only (Rabbi Adler and Mrs. Lynn Lynton)      were against such knowledge, while among the majority in favor of      it were Mme. Adam, Thomas Hardy, Sir Walter Besant, Bjoernson,      Hall Caine, Sarah Grand, Nordau, Lady Henry Somerset, Baroness      von Suttner, and Miss Willard. The leaders of the woman's      movement are, of course, in favor of such knowledge. Thus a      meeting of the Bund fuer Mutterschutz at Berlin, in 1905, almost      unanimously passed a resolution declaring that the early sexual      enlightenment of children in the facts of the sexual life is      urgently necessary (_Mutterschutz_, 1905, Heft 2, p. 91). It may      be added that medical opinion has long approved of this      enlightenment. Thus in England it was editorially stated in the      _British Medical Journal_ some years ago (June 9, 1894): \"Most      medical men of an age to beget confidence in such affairs will be      able to recall instances in which an ignorance, which would have      been ludicrous if it had not been so sad, has been displayed on      matters regarding which every woman entering on married life      ought to have been accurately informed. There can, we think, be      little doubt that much unhappiness and a great deal of illness      would be prevented if young people of both sexes possessed a      little accurate knowledge regarding the sexual relations, and      were well impressed with the profound importance of selecting      healthy mates. Knowledge need not necessarily be nasty, but even      if it were, it certainly is not comparable in that respect with      the imaginings of ignorance.\" In America, also, where at an      annual meeting of the American Medical Association, Dr. Denslow      Lewis, of Chicago, eloquently urged the need of teaching sexual      hygiene to youths and girls, all the subsequent nine speakers,      some of them physicians of worldwide fame, expressed their      essential agreement (_Medico-Legal Journal_, June-Sept., 1903).      Howard, again, at the end of his elaborate _History of      Matrimonial Institutions_ (vol. iii, p. 257) asserts the      necessity for education in matters of sex, as going to the root      of the marriage problem. \"In the future educational programme,\"      he remarks, \"sex questions must hold an honorable place.\"    While, however, it is now widely recognized that children are entitled to  sexual enlightenment, it cannot be said that this belief is widely put  into practice. Many persons, who are fully persuaded that children should  sooner or later be enlightened concerning the sexual sources of life, are  somewhat nervously anxious as to the precise age at which this  enlightenment should begin. Their latent feeling seems to be that sex is  an evil, and enlightenment concerning sex also an evil, however necessary,  and that the chief point is to ascertain the latest moment to which we can  safely postpone this necessary evil. Such an attitude is, however,  altogether wrong-headed. The child's desire for knowledge concerning the  origin of himself is a perfectly natural, honest, and harmless desire, so  long as it is not perverted by being thwarted. A child of four may ask  questions on this matter, simply and spontaneously. As soon as the  questions are put, certainly as soon as they become at all insistent, they  should be answered, in the same simple and spontaneous spirit, truthfully,  though according to the measure of the child's intelligence and his  capacity and desire for knowledge. This period should not, and, if these  indications are followed, naturally would not, in any case, be delayed  beyond the sixth year. After that age even the most carefully guarded  child is liable to contaminating communications from outside. Moll points  out that the sexual enlightenment of girls in its various stages ought to  be always a little ahead of that of boys, and as the development of girls  up to the pubertal age is more precocious than that of boys, this demand  is reasonable.    If the elements of sexual education are to be imparted in early childhood,  it is quite clear who ought to be the teacher. There should be no question  that this privilege belongs by every right to the mother. Except where a  child is artificially separated from his chief parent it is indeed only  the mother who has any natural opportunity of receiving and responding to  these questions. It is unnecessary for her to take any initiative in the  matter. The inevitable awakening of the child's intelligence and the  evolution of his boundless curiosity furnish her love and skill with all  opportunities for guiding her child's thoughts and knowledge. Nor is it  necessary for her to possess the slightest technical information at this  stage. It is only essential that she should have the most absolute faith  in the purity and dignity of her physical relationship to her child, and  be able to speak of it with frankness and tenderness. When that essential  condition is fulfilled every mother has all the knowledge that her young  child needs.        Among the best authorities, both men and women, in all the      countries where this matter is attracting attention, there seems      now to be unanimity of opinion in favor of the elementary facts      of the baby's relationship to its mother being explained to the      child by the mother as soon as the child begins to ask questions.      Thus in Germany Moll has repeatedly argued in this sense; he      insists that sexual enlightenment should be mainly a private and      individual matter; that in schools there should be no general and      personal warnings about masturbation, etc. (though at a later age      he approves of instruction in regard to venereal diseases), but      that the mother is the proper person to impart intimate knowledge      to the child, and that any age is suitable for the commencement      of such enlightenment, provided it is put into a form fitted for      the age (Moll, op. cit., p. 264).        At the Mannheim meeting of the Congress of the German Society for      Combating Venereal Disease, when the question of sexual      enlightenment formed the sole subject of discussion, the opinion      in favor of early teaching by the mother prevailed. \"It is the      mother who must, in the first place, be made responsible for the      child's clear understanding of sexual things, so often lacking,\"      said Frau Krukenberg (\"Die Aufgabe der Mutter,\"      _Sexualpaedagogik_, p. 13), while Max Enderlin, a teacher, said on      the same occasion (\"Die Sexuelle Frage in die Volksschule,\" id.,      p. 35): \"It is the mother who has to give the child his first      explanations, for it is to his mother that he first naturally      comes with his questions.\" In England, Canon Lyttelton, who is      distinguished among the heads of public schools not least by his      clear and admirable statements on these questions, states      (_Mothers and Sons_, p. 99) that the mother's part in the sexual      enlightenment and sexual guardianship of her son is of paramount      importance, and should begin at the earliest years. J.H. Badley,      another schoolmaster (\"The Sex Difficulty,\" _Broad Views_, June,      1904), also states that the mother's part comes first. Northcote      (_Christianity and Sex Problems_, p. 25) believes that the duty      of the parents is primary in this matter, the family doctor and      the schoolmaster coming in at a later stage. In America, Dr. Mary      Wood Allen, who occupies a prominent and influential position in      women's social movements, urges (in _Child-Confidence Rewarded_,      and other pamphlets) that a mother should begin to tell her child      these things as soon as he begins to ask questions, the age of      four not being too young, and explains how this may be done,      giving examples of its happy results in promoting a sweet      confidence between the child and his mother.    If, as a few believe should be the case, the first initiation is delayed  to the tenth year or even later, there is the difficulty that it is no  longer so easy to talk simply and naturally about such things; the mother  is beginning to feel too shy to speak for the first time about these  difficult subjects to a son or a daughter who is nearly as big as herself.  She feels that she can only do it awkwardly and ineffectively, and she  probably decides not to do it at all. Thus an atmosphere of mystery is  created with all the embarrassing and perverting influences which mystery  encourages.        There can be no doubt that, more especially in highly intelligent      children with vague and unspecialized yet insistent sexual      impulses, the artificial mystery with which sex is too often      clothed not only accentuates the natural curiosity but also tends      to favor the morbid"]]]
