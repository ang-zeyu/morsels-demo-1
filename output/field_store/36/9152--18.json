A sort of blight it would seem had descended upon humanity  in Upper Crossleys. It was all very curious.    Reflecting upon the matter, and sometimes interjecting a word or two  into the purely technical and very desultory conversation proceeding  between the landlord and Hawkins, I sat looking from one to the other,  more than ever convinced that no friendship was lost between them. My  position in the room was such that any one entering would not detect  my presence until he was right up to the bar, and to this sheltered  seat I was undoubtedly indebted for a very strange experience.    During a lull in the patently forced conversation I heard footsteps  upon the cobbles outside. Hawkins and the landlord exchanged a swift  glance, and then to my surprise they both stared at me questioningly.  Before a word could be exchanged, however, and before I had time even  to surmise what this covert uneasiness might portend, a young fellow  entered whose carriage and dress immediately attracted my attention.    He was attired, then, in a sort of burlesque \"fashionable\" lounge suit  and wore a straw hat set rakishly backward on his well-oiled dark  hair. He carried gloves and a malacca cane, and his gait was one of  assured superiority. He was a stoutly-built, muscular young fellow and  might ordinarily have been good-looking after a rustic fashion, but  what principally rendered him noticeable was the fact that he wore  surgical bandages around his neck in lieu of a collar and that his  face was literally a mosaic of sticking-plaster!    \"Evening, Martin--evening, Hawkins,\" he said jauntily; and advancing  to the bar, \"The usual, Martin.\"    As he gave the order and as the landlord turned to execute it,  exhibiting a sort of half-amused deference, the embarrassed glance of  Hawkins, who was watching me uncomfortably, drew the newcomer's  attention to my presence. He turned in a flash and I saw those parts  of his face which were visible between the pieces of strapping to turn  fierily red. His brown eyes glared at me, and:    \"Martin!\" he cried, throwing out his hand in the landlord's direction,  \"Martin, damn you! There is a stranger here! Why the devil didn't you  tell me?\"    \"Sorry, Mr. Edward,\" said the landlord, setting a glass of whisky  before the excited man. \"No time.\"    \"It's a lie!\" cried the other, with a wild fury which so trivial a  matter did not seem to warrant, \"a deliberate damned lie! You want to  make me the laughing-stock of the place!\"    Taking up the newly-filled glass, he dashed it violently to the sanded  floor, so that it was shattered to bits. Then, snatching off his hat,  he held it as a shield between my inquiring gaze and his plastered  face, and ran out of the room. At the door:    \"Damn you all!\" he shouted back at us.    I heard his quick footsteps receding. Then, as he turned the corner  the sound died away. I looked across at Hawkins. He was staring into  his tankard with which he was describing slow circles as if to stir  the contents. Martin, having raised the bar-flap was phlegmatically  engaged in sweeping up the fragments of glass into a dustpan. It came  to me all at once that these simple folk regarded the other's outburst  as a personal matter; their attitude was that of the grieved elders of  a family, some member of which has misbehaved himself. But assuredly I  was not prepared to concur in this shielding silence; the pressman  within me demanded an explanation.    \"A strange young man,\" I said tentatively. \"Very touchy, I should  think?\"    \"Touchy?\" repeated Hawkins, glancing up quickly. \"I seen him take Tom  Pike by the scruff of his neck and the seat of his pants and pitch him  in the horse-trough for askin' of him who his tailor was, I have.\"    \"Indeed,\" said I, \"a local Carpentier, no doubt?\"    \"Ah,\" said Martin, glancing at me as he turned to his seat behind the  bar. \"Very 'andy with 'is 'ands.\"    \"He is evidently acutely sensitive of his present disfigurement. Might  I suggest that his most recent encounter was with a barbed-wire  entanglement?\"    But to my acute disappointment, Martin merely growled, shaking his  head gloomily; and in this significant gesture he was closely imitated  by Hawkins. Therefore:    \"Is he badly disfigured?\" I persisted.    \"Only one is deep,\" replied Hawkins, glancing almost apologetically at  the landlord. The unfortunate incident seemed to have drawn them more  closely together. \"The one on his neck. But he prides himself on his  looks, don't he, Martin?\"    \"He do,\" agreed Martin.    I took the bull by the horns. I never neglect an opportunity of this  nature, for however irrelevant to the matter in hand an episode may  seem to be, not infrequently I have found that it is by the pursuit of  such chance clews that one is led to the very piece of news that is  sought.    \"Drink up, gentlemen,\" I said, \"and as the night draws on, we shall  just have time for a peg of whisky before ten o'clock.\"    My effort proved successful, for whilst Martin prepared the ordered  drinks, almost with alacrity, Hawkins became quite confidential.    \"Young Mr. Edward Hines that was, sir,\" he confided, in a church  whisper. \"His father is the biggest farmer round these parts and young  Mr. Edward is a terror with the gals, he is. Mind you, he's straight  out about it. Comes in here, he do, and says straight out who he's  after. And it's woe betide the one who takes him up on it. I'm glad my  gal is up to London, with that Mr. Edward about, I am.\"    The drinks being placed upon the counter, he ceased, and:    \"Good health!\" said I; then: \"Yes--about our mutilated young friend?\"  I prompted.    \"Well,\" continued Hawkins--\"it's kind o' funny, ain't it, Martin?\"    The landlord growled.    \"Mr. Edward he come in here three weeks back all puffed up with  himself. Said he'd got an appointment with a lady down from London  what was coming all the way from West Wingham to see him. Didn't he,  Martin?\"    Martin corroborated.    \"He see her, too,\" declared Hawkins with a sort of schoolboy naivete.  \"And he see her again four nights after. She give him a present--a  keepsake. He showed us. Then he seen her a third time, and--\"    Hawkins ceased speaking and looked at the landlord as if mutely  appealing for his aid in making clear to me what occurred at this  third tryst with the mysterious \"lady from London.\"    \"Go on,\" prompted Martin. \"Tell him. He's stopping here; he's all  right.\"    I keenly appreciated the compliment conveyed by this, the landlord's  longest speech of the evening, and raised my glass to him. \"Well,  then,\" Hawkins resumed, \"we didn't see him for a night or two, but on  the Wednesday--\"    \"The Thursday,\" corrected Martin.    \"Right you are, Martin,\" agreed Hawkins--\"the Thursday it were. I met  Farmer Hines comin' back from Wingham market as I came here mid-day.  It were the Thursday. Well, then, on the Thursday young Mr. Edward he  turns up after dark. Sort of slinked in he did. There was three or  four of us here, there was that night, wasn't there, Martin? 'Course  it were market day. Slinked in he did, and his face was like you see  it to-night only worse. He never said a word to nobody and nobody  never said nothin' to him, not likely. Just gulped down a double  Scotch and slinked out. What do you think about that for a story, eh,  sir?\"    He looked at me triumphantly. For my own part I must confess I was  disappointed. A cat-and-dog squabble between a rustic Lothario and  some local virago did not excite me so intensely as it seemed to  excite my companions.    \"Is that all you know of the matter?\" I asked.    \"No,\" answered Martin, \"it ain't. Tell him, Hawkins.\"    \"Aye,\" resumed Hawkins, \"he might as well know, as he's livin' here.  Well, sir, young Mr. Edward he's very quiet about what happened to  him. Maybe we shouldn't have thought so much about it like if it  hadn't been that in this very bar, six months ago, he'd plagued the  life out of young Harry Adams.\"    \"For what reason?\" I asked idly; the conversation was beginning to  bore me. But:    \"Young Harry Adams,\" explained Hawkins with gusto, and his former  wicked look returning to his eyes, \"at one time was Mr. Edward's only  rival with the gals, he was. A good-lookin' young fellow; got a  commission in the war he did. He's up to London now. Well, six months  ago young Harry Adams come staggerin' in here one night with blood  runnin' from his face and neck. He fell down in that seat where you're  sitting now and fainted right off, didn't he, Martin? We had to send  young Jim Corder (what used to come here in them days) off runnin' all  the way past Leeways for the doctor. Ah, that were a night.\"    \"It were,\" agreed Martin.    \"Same as Mr. Edward,\" continued the narrator, \"young Harry Adams  wouldn't say a word about what happened to him. But when Mr. Edward  first see him, all over sticking-plaster, he laughed till the pots  nearly fell off the hooks, he did. Little did he guess his own turn  was to come!\"    My interest revived.    \"Then in the case of, er--Mr. Adams,\" I said, \"you never had any  particulars whatever?\"    \"Never,\" replied Martin. \"Time, please, gentlemen.\"    \"Aye,\" said Hawkins, rising. \"Time it be. Well, good night, sir. Good  night, Martin.\"    \"Good night.\"    Hawkins moved towards the door, and indeed was on the point of going  out when I remembered something which I had meant to ask earlier, but  which, owing to lack of opportunity, I had postponed asking.    \"You spoke of a gift or keepsake, which the lady from London gave to  Mr. Hines,\" I said. \"I think you mentioned that he had shown it to  you. I am rather curious about this story. Might I ask the nature of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#16)"],[1,"t, air-holes and thin  spots where several serious accidents had occurred.    Therefore, Wingate's Pond was not used as much as the river for skating;  but this winter the ice was as smooth and solid as if it had been frozen  artificially, so the High School boys and girls could not resist the  temptation to skim over its surface.    \"Isn't it a fine sight?\" asked Grace, as they came in view of the skaters  who were circling and gliding over the pond, some by twos and threes,  others in long rows, laughing and shouting.    A big fire burned on the bank, rows of new-comers sat near it, fitting on  their skates.    \"Away with dull care!\" cried Hippy, as he circled gracefully over the ice;  for, with all his weight, Hippy was considered one of the best skaters in  Oakdale.    \"Away with everything but fun,\" finished Grace who could think of nothing  save the joy of skating. \"Come along, Anne. Don't be afraid. David and I  will keep you up until you learn to use those tiny little feet of yours.\"    Anne's small feet went almost higher than her head while Grace was  speaking, and she sat flat down on the ice.    \"No harm done,\" she laughed, \"only I didn't know it could possibly be so  slippery.\"    They pulled her up, David and Grace, and put her between them with Tom  Gray on the other side of Grace as additional support, and off they flew,  while Anne, keeping her feet together and holding on tightly, sailed along  like a small ice boat.    \"This will give you confidence,\" explained David, \"and later on you can  learn how to use your feet.\"    But Anne hardly heard him, so thrilled was she by the glorious sensation.  As they flew by, followed by Hippy and Nora, with Reddy and Jessica, she  caught glimpses of many people looking strangely unfamiliar on skates.  Miriam passed, gliding gracefully over the ice with a troop of sophomores  at her heels. There were many High School boys \"cracking the whip\" in long  rows of eight or more, while there were some older people comfortably  seated in sleigh chairs which were pushed from behind, generally by some  poor boys in Oakdale, who stood on the bank waiting to be hired.    \"Now, we'll have a lesson,\" exclaimed David when they had reached the  starting point again, while the others lost themselves in the crowd. Anne  was a good pupil, but she was soon tired and sat down on a bench near the  bank.    \"Do go and have a good skate yourself, David,\" she insisted. \"I'll rest  for awhile and look on.\"    But it was far too cold to sit still.    \"I'll give myself a lesson,\" she said. \"This is a quiet spot. All the  others seem to have skated up to the other end.\"    As she was carefully taking the strokes David had taught her, with an  occasional struggle to keep her balance, she heard a great shouting behind  her. The next instant, some one had seized her by the hand.    \"Keep your feet together!\" was shouted in her ear, and she found herself  going like the wind at the end of a long line of girls. They were juniors,  she saw at once, and it was Julia Crosby at the whip end who had seized  her by the hand.    Anne closed her eyes. They were going at a tremendous rate of speed, it  seemed to her, like a comet shooting through the air. Then, suddenly, the  head of the comet stood still and the tail swung around it, and Anne, who  represented the very tip of the tail and who hardly reached to Julia  Crosby's shoulder, felt herself carried along with such velocity that the  breath left her body, her knees gave way and she fell down in a limp  little bundle. Julia Crosby instantly let go her hand and the impetus of  the rush shot her like a catapult far over the ice into the midst of a  crowd of skaters.    But the juniors never stopped to see what damage had been done. They  quickly joined hands again, and were off on another expedition almost  before Anne had been picked up by David and Hippy.    \"It's that Julia Crosby again,\" cried David. \"I wish she would move to  Europe. I'd gladly buy her a ticket. The town of Oakdale isn't big enough  to hold her and other people. She's always trying to knock somebody off  the side of the earth.\"    Anne went home, tired and bruised. She had had enough of skating for one  morning David returned to join the others; for this was not the last of  the day's adventures and Julia Crosby, before sunset, was to repent of her  cruelty to Anne.    In the meantime Grace and Tom had skated up to the far end of the pond.    \"Well, Grace,\" said Tom, \"how has the world been using you? I suppose you  have been adding to your laurels as a basketball captain.\"    \"Far from it,\" said Grace a trifle sadly. \"Miriam Nesbit is star player at  present.\"    They skated on for some time in silence. Tom felt there was something  wrong, so he tactfully changed the subject.    \"Who is the girl doing the fancy strokes?\" he asked, pointing to Julia  Crosby, who, some distance ahead of them, was giving an exhibition of her  powers as a maker of figure eights and cross-cuts.    \"That's the junior captain,\" answered Grace. \"I hope she won't fall,  because she's heavy enough to go right through the ice if she should have  a hard tumble.\"    \"Suppose we stop watching her,\" suggested Tom. \"I don't want to see her  take a header, and people who show off on skates always do so, sooner or  later.\"    They changed their course toward the middle of the pond, while Julia, who  was turning and circling nearer the shore, watched them from one corner of  her eye.    Suddenly Grace stopped.    \"Julia! Julia!\" she cried. \"Miss Crosby!\"    \"What's the matter?\" demanded Tom.    \"Don't you see the danger flag over there? She will skate into a hole if  she keeps on. The ice houses are near here, and I suppose it is where they  have been cutting ice.\"    \"Hello-o!\" cried Tom, straining his lungs to reach the skater, who looked  back, gave her usual tantalizing laugh and skated on.    \"You are getting onto thin ice,\" screamed Grace in despair, beckoning  wildly. \"Stop! Stop!\"    Julia Crosby was skating backwards now, facing the others.    \"Catch me if you can,\" she called, and the wind carried her words to them  as they flew after her.    Then Grace, who had been anxiously watching the skater and not the ice,  stumbled on a piece of frozen wood and fell headlong. She lay still for an  instant, half stunned by the blow, but even in that distressful moment she  could hear the other girl's derisive laughter.    Tom called again:    \"You'll be drowned, if you don't look where you are going.\"    \"Why don't you learn to skate?\" was Julia's answer.    \"O Tom,\" exclaimed Grace. \"Leave me. I'll soon get my breath. Do go and  stop that girl. The pond's awfully deep there.\"    \"Miss Crosby,\" Tom Gray called, \"won't you wait a minute? I have something  to tell you.\"    \"Catch me first!\" she cried.    She turned and began skating for dear life, bending from the waist and  going like the wind.    \"I think I'll try and catch her from the front,\" he said to himself. \"I  don't propose to tumble in, too, and leave poor Grace to fish, us both  out.\"    With arms swinging freely, he made for the center of the pond. As he  whizzed past the girl, he turned with a wide sweep and came toward her,  pointing at the same time to the white flag. But it was too late. In her  effort to outstrip him, Julia slid heavily into the danger zone.    There was a crash and a splash, then down she went into the icy water,  followed by Tom, who had seized her arm in a fruitless effort to save her.    For an instant Tom was paralyzed with the coldness of the water. Still,  keeping a firm grip on the arm of the girl who had been responsible for  his ice bath, he managed to clutch the ledge of ice made by their fall  with his free hand.    \"Take hold of the ice and try to help yourself a little,\" commanded Tom.    Julia made a half-hearted attempt, and managed to grasp the ledge, but her  hold was so feeble that Tom dared not withdraw his support He was  powerless to act, and they would both drown unless help came quickly.          CHAPTER XIV    A BRAVE RESCUE      Grace was still where she had fallen, cooling a large, red lump on her  forehead by applying her handkerchief first to the ice and then to the  swollen place, when she suddenly felt herself to be entirely alone in the  world.    \"Everybody has gone home to dinner!\" she exclaimed, as she glanced over  her shoulder at the other end of the pond, now denuded of skaters.    Then she shifted her position, looking for Tom and Julia. She had never  dreamed, when she saw her friend go whizzing across the ice, that he had  not caught the reckless girl in time to warn her of her danger.    In a flash she saw the empty expanse of ice before her. She leaped to her  feet, balancing herself with difficulty, for her head was still dizzy from  the blow.    \"Tom! Tom Gray!\" she called. \"Where are you?\"    \"Run for help!\" came the answer. In another moment she saw them clinging  to a broken ledge of ice, Tom supporting Julia Crosby.    As for the junior captain, she was weeping bitterly, and making no attempt  to help herself.    Grace anxiously scanned the expanse of the ice. It was nearly a mile to  the other end of the pond, and the last group of skaters had disappeared  over the brow of the hill.    \"You must think quickly,\" she said to herself.    Her eyes took in the other shore. Not a soul was there, not a dwelling of  any sort; nothing but the great ice house that stood like a lonely  sentinel on the bank. Yet something seemed to tell her that help lay in  that direction.    Once before, in a moment of danger, Grace had obeyed this same impulse and  had never regretted it. Once again she was following the instinct that  might have seemed to another person anything but wise.    Skating as she had never skated before, Grace Harlowe reached the shore in  a moment. Here, dropping to the bank, she quickly removed her skates, then  ran toward the ice house, feeling strangely unaccustomed "]]]
