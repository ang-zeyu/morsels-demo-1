Almost any part of us is subject to  this kind of apparent loss. In neurasthenia the happy, healthy  complexes which have hitherto dominated our lives may be split off and  left lying dormant in the subconscious; or the power of will or  concentration may seem to be gone. In hysteria we may seem to lose the  ability to see or feel or walk, or we may lose for the time all  recollection of certain past events, or of whole periods of our lives,  or of everything but one system of ideas which monopolizes the field  of attention. Sometimes great systems of memories, instincts, and  complexes are alternately shifted in and out of gear, leaving first  one kind of person on top and then another.[25] Stevenson's _Dr.  Jekyll_ and _Mr. Hyde_ is not so fantastic a character as he seems.  Any one who doubts the ability of the mind to split itself up into two  or more distinct personalities, entertaining totally different  conceptions of life, disliking each other, playing tricks on each  other, writing notes to each other, and carrying on a perpetual feud  as each tries to get the upper hand, should read Morton Prince's  \"Dissociation of a Personality,\" a fascinating account of his famous  case, Miss Beauchamp.    [Footnote 25: When a memory or system of memories is suddenly lost  from consciousness the person is said to be suffering from amnesia or  pathological loss of memory.]    =Internal Warfare.= Conflict, often accentuated by shock or fatigue,  represses or drives down certain ideas, perceptions, wishes, memories,  or complexes into the subconscious, where they remain, sometimes  dormant and passive but often dynamic, emotional, carrying on an  over-excited, automatic activity, freed from the control of reason and  the modifying influence of other ideas, and able to cause almost any  kind of disturbance. So long as there is team-work between the  various parts of our personality we are able to act as a unit; but  just as soon as we break up into factions with no communication  between the warring camps, so soon do we become quite incapable of  cooerdination or adjustment, like a nation torn by civil war. Many of  the seemingly fantastic and bizarre mental phenomena of which a human  being is capable are the result of this kind of disintegration.    However, nature has a remarkable power for righting herself, and it is  only under an accumulation of unfortunate circumstances that there  appears a neurosis, which is nothing more than a functioning of  certain parts of the personality with all the rest dissociated. We  shall later inquire more fully into the causes that lead up to such a  result and shall find that the mechanisms involved are these processes  of organization and disorganization by which mind is wont to group  together or separate the various elements within its borders.      SUMMARY    Gathering up our impressions, we find a number of outstanding  qualities which we may summarize in the following way:    The Subconscious is:    _1 Vast yet Explorable_    The fraction that could accurately show the relation of the conscious  to the unconscious part of ourselves would have such a small numerator  and such a huge denominator that we might well wonder where  consciousness came in at all.[26] Some one has likened the  subconscious to the great far-reaching depths of the Mammoth Cave, and  consciousness to the tiny, flickering lamp which we carry to light our  way in the darkness. However, ever the subconscious mind is becoming  explorable, and it may be that science is giving the tiny lamp the  revealing power of a great searchlight.    [Footnote 26: \"The entire active life of the individual may be  represented by a fraction, the numerator of which is any particular  moment, the denominator is the rich inheritance of the  past.\"--Jelliffe: \"The Technique of Psychoanalysis,\" _Psychoanalytic  Review,_ Vol. III, No. 2, p. 164.]    _2 Ancient yet Modern_    The lowest layers of the subconscious, represented by the instincts,  are as old as life itself, with their lineage reaching back in direct  and unbroken line to the first living things on the ooze of the ocean  floor. The higher strata are more modern, full, and accurate records  of our own lifetime, beginning with our first cry and ending with  to-day's thoughts.    _3 Primitive yet Refined_    The lowest level, representing the past of the race, is primitive like  a savage, and infantile, like a child; it is instinctive, unalterable,  and universal; it knows no restraint, no culture, and no prudence. The  higher level, the storehouse of individual experience, bears the  marks of acquired ideals, of cultivated refinement, and represents  among other things the precepts and prudence of civilized society.    _4 Emotional yet Intellectual_    Our records of the past are not dead archives, but living  forces--persistent, urging, dynamic and emotional. They give meaning  to new experiences, color our judgments, shape our beliefs, determine  our interests, and, if wrongly handled, make their way into  consciousness as neurotic symptoms.    However, the subconscious is not all emotion. It is a mind capable of  elaborate thought, able to calculate, to scheme, to answer doubts, to  solve problems, to fabricate the purposeful, fantastic allegories of  dreams and to create from mere knowledge the inspired works of genius.    But the subconscious has one great limitation, it cannot reason  inductively. Given a premise, this mind can reason as unerringly as  the most skilful logician; that is, it can reason deductively, but it  cannot arrive at a general conclusion from a number of particular  facts. However, except for inductive reasoning and awareness, the  subconscious seems to possess all the attributes of conscious mind and  is in fact an intellectual force to be reckoned with.    _5 Organized yet Disorganizable_    The subconscious mind is a highly organized institution, but like all  such institutions it is liable to disorganization when rent by  internal dissension. Ordinarily it keeps its ideas and emotions, its  complexes and moods in fairly accurate order, but when upset by  emotional warfare, it gets its records confused and falls into a  chaotic state which makes regular business impossible.    _6 Masterful yet Obedient_    The subconscious, which is master of the body, is in normal life the  servant of consciousness. One of its outstanding qualities is  suggestibility. Since it cannot reason from particulars to a general  conclusion it takes any statement given it by consciousness, believes  it implicitly and acts accordingly.    The pilot wheel of the ship is, after all, the conscious mind,  insignificant in size when compared with the great mass of the vessel,  but all-powerful in its ability to direct the course of the voyage.    Nervous persons are people who are too much under the sway of the  subconscious; so, too, are some geniuses, who narrowly escape a  neurosis by finding a more useful outlet for their subconscious  energies. While the poet, the inventor, and the neurotic are likely to  be too largely controlled by the subconscious, the average man is to a  greater extent ruled by the conscious mind; and the highest type of  genius is the man whose conscious and subconscious minds work together  in perfect harmony, each up to its full power.    If, as many believe, the next great strides of science are to be in  this direction, it may pay some of us to be pioneers in learning how  to make use of these undeveloped riches of memory, organization, and  surplus energy. The subconscious, which can on occasion behave like a  very devil within us, is, when rightly used, our greatest asset, the  source of powers whose appearance in the occasional individual has  been considered almost superhuman, but which prove to be  characteristically human, the common inheritance of the race of man.          CHAPTER VI    _In which we learn why it pays to be cheerful_    BODY AND MIND    THE MISSING LINK      =Ancient Knowledge.= People have always known that mind in some  strange way carries its moods over into the body. The writer of the  Book of Proverbs tells us, from that far-off day, that \"A merry heart  doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bones.\"  Jesus in His healing ministry always emphasized the place of faith in  the cure of the body. \"Thy faith hath made thee whole,\" is a frequent  word on His lips, and ever since His day people have been  rediscovering the truth that faith, even in the absence of a worthy  object, does often make whole. Faith in the doctor, the medicine, the  charm, the mineral waters, the shrine, and in the good God, has  brought health to many thousands of sufferers. People have always  reckoned on this bodily result from a mental state. They have  intuitively known better than to tell a sick person that he is looking  worse, but they have not always known why. They have known that a fit  of anger is apt to bring on a headache, but they have not stopped to  look for the reason, or if they have, they have often gotten  themselves into a tangle. This is because there has always been, until  recently, a missing link. Now the link has been found. After the last  chapter, it will not be hard to understand that this connecting link,  this go-between of body and mind, is nothing else than the  subconscious mind. When we remember that it has the double power of  knowing our thoughts and of controlling our bodies, it is not hard to  see how an idea can translate itself into a pain, nor to realize with  new vividness the truth of the statement that healthy mental states  make for health, and unhealthy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#16)"],[1,"  so, that guardian of your honor, your courage, will forsake and leave  you.--By the laws of Lycurgus, and by those which were given to the  Cretans by Jupiter, or which Minos established under the direction of  Jupiter, as the poets say, the youths of the State are trained by the  practice of hunting, running, enduring hunger and thirst, cold and  heat. The boys at Sparta are scourged so at the altars that blood  follows the lash in abundance; nay, sometimes, as I used to hear when I  was there, they are whipped even to death; and yet not one of them was  ever heard to cry out, or so much as groan. What, then? Shall men not  be able to bear what boys do? and shall custom have such great force,  and reason none at all?    XV. There is some difference between labor and pain; they border upon  one another, but still there is a certain difference between them.  Labor is a certain exercise of the mind or body, in some employment or  undertaking of serious trouble and importance; but pain is a sharp  motion in the body, disagreeable to our senses.--Both these feelings,  the Greeks, whose language is more copious than ours, express by the  common name of [Greek: Ponos]: therefore they call industrious men  painstaking, or, rather, fond of labor; we, more conveniently, call  them laborious; for laboring is one thing, and enduring pain another.  You see, O Greece! your barrenness of words, sometimes, though you  think you are always so rich in them. I say, then, that there is a  difference between laboring and being in pain. When Caius Marius had an  operation performed for a swelling in his thigh, he felt pain; when he  headed his troops in a very hot season, he labored. Yet these two  feelings bear some resemblance to one another; for the accustoming  ourselves to labor makes the endurance of pain more easy to us. And it  was because they were influenced by this reason that the founders of  the Grecian form of government provided that the bodies of their youth  should be strengthened by labor, which custom the Spartans transferred  even to their women, who in other cities lived more delicately, keeping  within the walls of their houses; but it was otherwise with the  Spartans.        The Spartan women, with a manly air,      Fatigues and dangers with their husbands share;      They in fantastic sports have no delight,      Partners with them in exercise and fight.    And in these laborious exercises pain interferes sometimes. They are  thrown down, receive blows, have bad falls, and are bruised, and the  labor itself produces a sort of callousness to pain.    XVI. As to military service (I speak of our own, not of that of the  Spartans, for they used to march slowly to the sound of the flute, and  scarce a word of command was given without an anapaest), you may see, in  the first place, whence the very name of an army (_exercitus_[33]) is  derived; and, secondly, how great the labor is of an army on its march:  then consider that they carry more than a fortnight's provision, and  whatever else they may want; that they carry the burden of the  stakes,[34] for as to shield, sword, or helmet, they look on them as no  more encumbrance than their own limbs, for they say that arms are the  limbs of a soldier, and those, indeed, they carry so commodiously that,  when there is occasion, they throw down their burdens, and use their  arms as readily as their limbs. Why need I mention the exercises of the  legions? And how great the labor is which is undergone in the running,  encounters, shouts! Hence it is that their minds are worked up to make  so light of wounds in action. Take a soldier of equal bravery, but  undisciplined, and he will seem a woman. Why is it that there is this  sensible difference between a raw recruit and a veteran soldier? The  age of the young soldiers is for the most part in their favor; but it  is practice only that enables men to bear labor and despise wounds.  Moreover, we often see, when the wounded are carried off the field, the  raw, untried soldier, though but slightly wounded, cries out most  shamefully; but the more brave, experienced veteran only inquires for  some one to dress his wounds, and says,        Patroclus, to thy aid I must appeal      Ere worse ensue, my bleeding wounds to heal;      The sons of AEsculapius are employ'd,      No room for me, so many are annoy'd.    XVII. This is certainly Eurypylus himself. What an experienced  man!--While his friend is continually enlarging on his misfortunes, you  may observe that he is so far from weeping that he even assigns a  reason why he should bear his wounds with patience.        Who at his enemy a stroke directs,      His sword to light upon himself expects.    Patroclus, I suppose, will lead him off to his chamber to bind up his  wounds, at least if he be a man: but not a word of that; he only  inquires how the battle went:        Say how the Argives bear themselves in fight?    And yet no words can show the truth as well as those, your deeds and  visible sufferings.        Peace! and my wounds bind up;    but though Eurypylus could bear these afflictions, AEsopus could not,        Where Hector's fortune press'd our yielding troops;    and he explains the rest, though in pain. So unbounded is military  glory in a brave man! Shall, then, a veteran soldier be able to behave  in this manner, and shall a wise and learned man not be able? Surely  the latter might be able to bear pain better, and in no small degree  either. At present, however, I am confining myself to what is  engendered by practice and discipline. I am not yet come to speak of  reason and philosophy. You may often hear of old women living without  victuals for three or four days; but take away a wrestler's provisions  but for one day, and he will implore the aid of Jupiter Olympius, the  very God for whom he exercises himself: he will cry out that he cannot  endure it. Great is the force of custom! Sportsmen will continue whole  nights in the snow; they will bear being almost frozen upon the  mountains. From practice boxers will not so much as utter a groan,  however bruised by the cestus. But what do you think of those to whom a  victory in the Olympic games seemed almost on a par with the ancient  consulships of the Roman people? What wounds will the gladiators bear,  who are either barbarians, or the very dregs of mankind! How do they,  who are trained to it, prefer being wounded to basely avoiding it! How  often do they prove that they consider nothing but the giving  satisfaction to their masters or to the people! for when covered with  wounds, they send to their masters to learn their pleasure: if it is  their will, they are ready to lie down and die. What gladiator, of even  moderate reputation, ever gave a sigh? who ever turned pale? who ever  disgraced himself either in the actual combat, or even when about to  die? who that had been defeated ever drew in his neck to avoid the  stroke of death? So great is the force of practice, deliberation, and  custom! Shall this, then, be done by        A Samnite rascal, worthy of his trade;    and shall a man born to glory have so soft a part in his soul as not to  be able to fortify it by reason and reflection? The sight of the  gladiators' combats is by some looked on as cruel and inhuman, and I do  not know, as it is at present managed, but it may be so; but when the  guilty fought, we might receive by our ears perhaps (but certainly by  our eyes we could not) better training to harden us against pain and  death.    XVIII. I have now said enough about the effects of exercise, custom,  and careful meditation. Proceed we now to consider the force of reason,  unless you have something to reply to what has been said.    _A._ That I should interrupt you! By no means; for your discourse has  brought me over to your opinion. Let the Stoics, then, think it their  business to determine whether pain be an evil or not, while they  endeavor to show by some strained and trifling conclusions, which are  nothing to the purpose, that pain is no evil. My opinion is, that  whatever it is, it is not so great as it appears; and I say, that men  are influenced to a great extent by some false representations and  appearance of it, and that all which is really felt is capable of being  endured. Where shall I begin, then? Shall I superficially go over what  I said before, that my discourse may have a greater scope?    This, then, is agreed upon by all, and not only by learned men, but  also by the unlearned, that it becomes the brave and magnanimous--those  that have patience and a spirit above this world--not to give way to  pain. Nor has there ever been any one who did not commend a man who  bore it in this manner. That, then, which is expected from a brave man,  and is commended when it is seen, it must surely be base in any one to  be afraid of at its approach, or not to bear when it comes. But I would  have you consider whether, as all the right affections of the soul are  classed under the name of virtues, the truth is that this is not  properly the name of them all, but that they all have their name from  that leading virtue which is superior to all the rest: for the name  \"virtue\" comes from _vir_, a man, and courage is the peculiar  distinction of a man: and this virtue has two principal duties, to  despise death and pain. We must, then, exert these, if we would be men  of virtue, or, rather, if we would be men, because virtue (_virtus_)  takes its very name from _vir_, man.    XIX. You may inquire, perhaps, how? And such an inquiry is not amiss,  for philosophy is ready with her assistance. Epicurus offers himself to  you, a man far from a bad--or, I should rather say, a very good man: he  advises no more than he knows. \"Despise pain,\" says he. Who is it saith  this? Is it the same man who calls pain the greatest of all evils? It  is not, indeed, very consistent in him. Let us hear what he says: \"If  the pain is excessive, it must"]]]
