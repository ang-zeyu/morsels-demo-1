It is fortunate for some men that these sciences are not more  extensively understood, or a great many persons would suffer for their  natural and cerebral conformation.    \"You will soon be free, my son.\"    \"Free! thank God!\" exclaimed Dumiger, throwing himself back on his  pillow and clasping his hands in gratitude.    \"You are too quick, young man,\" continued the stranger. \"I said you  would soon be free, if--you see there is an _if_. It is for you to  remove it.\"    \"If--if what? I will do anything you tell me,\" almost shrieked  Dumiger, so terrified was he at the possibility of his hopes deserting  him.    \"Well,\" continued the little man, putting on his spectacles and  examining the roll of his papers, \"I will commence by telling you that  I am a native of Hamburgh and like yourself, a great mechanist. I was  sent for by the Council last evening, to examine all the models which  have been received. I do not hesitate to say to you that yours is by  far the best.\"    \"God be praised, Marguerite, Marguerite!\" ejaculated Dumiger.    \"Yes,\" quickly remarked the mysterious visitor, \"yours is by far  superior to all the rest, but it will not win the prize.\"    \"Not win the prize!\" said Dumiger; for now all his ambition had  returned to him.    \"Certainly not,\" was the reply; \"you know as well as I do that the  machinery requires some directing power. No one knows how to apply it:  no one knows the secret.\"    \"Yes, there is a secret,\" said the youth, his face brightening even  through the cold, clammy prison atmosphere.    \"And you cannot get out to tell it, or to arrange your own work,  for here I have a schedule of the judgments for debt which have been  lodged against you;\" and he held out a list some twelve inches in  length.    Dumiger groaned. \"And are there no means of paying this?\"    \"You can answer that question as well as myself,\" replied the man. \"I  will tell you that there are none for the present; but there is one  way in which the clock may still be the admiration of Dantzic, and  yourself free with a great independence in three days.\"    \"What way? what way? tell me quickly!\" cried Dumiger, gasping with  anxiety.    \"Be still, young man, be still; we have plenty of time: let's proceed  quietly,\" said the stranger.    \"Well, well, but be quick,\" continued Dumiger, in anything but a quiet  tone of voice.    \"I have told you,\" said the man, quietly readjusting his spectacles,  which Dumiger had slightly disturbed by the violence with which he  seized his arm, \"I have told you that I am a native of Hambro', a  mechanician; that I have seen your clock, admired it, and taken the  trouble to obtain a list of your liabilities,--here it is again.\"    Dumiger gave another groan.    \"Your position,\" continued the stranger, \"appears to me to be  this--that without my assistance your clock will be worth nothing,  while you will remain quietly in prison here, charged besides, as  far as I can understand the matter, with some political offense; that  Marguerite will either pine away or atone for your loss by amusing  herself with some of your friends--Carl and Krantz for instance. You  see I am _au fait_ with all your domestic matters.\"    Oh, jealousy! oh, cowardice of the heart! At the name of Carl the  blood flew to Dumiger's temples. It just occurred to him that it was  strange that Marguerite should have gone to him for assistance without  any direction from himself to do so. Root out the feeling, Dumiger;  root it out, or you are lost.    The stranger smiled sarcastically, but affected not to notice his  flushed cheek and faltering voice.    \"Now there is but one means to relieve yourself from all these risks  and this load of misery.\"    \"Again I inquire, what is it?\" said Dumiger.    \"Sell me your clock: I have come to purchase it on the part of the  free city of Hamburgh,\" was the calm, deliberate reply.    \"Sell my clock!\" echoed Dumiger.    \"The city of Hamburgh,\" continued the stranger, without appearing to  remark Dumiger's exclamation, \"authorizes me to offer for the clock of  best workmanship, the freedom of her walls, an income of four thousand  dollars, a place in the chief council with due precedence, and many  other minor advantages. If you accept these terms a large installment  of money will be paid within three days,--that is, within the time  for the return of post. You will naturally inquire, Why the city of  Hambro' should make so extravagant an offer? I will recall to you  the extreme jealousy which has always existed between these two  great commercial cities. You will remember that this rivalry is  unceasing--that it comprehends all things, the smallest as well as the  greatest. They attempted to vie with each other in the construction of  their doms: Dantzic gained the advantage. The fame and the prize given  for excellence in these clocks, and of the unrivaled workmanship which  may be expected, has spread throughout Germany. The inhabitants  of Hambro' are inferior in science. They wish to obtain a piece of  workmanship which shall be unrivaled, in the easiest manner, and I  was sent here to negotiate the purchase. Well, I was selected by the  Council here as one of the judges. It is an act of treachery--granted:  that cannot affect you. All that there is for you to decide on are the  terms I have offered you.\"    \"Oh! Marguerite!\" exclaimed Dumiger, \"if you were here, what would you  counsel?\"    \"What would she counsel,\" said the stranger, \"except to accept this  offer? Remember, if you refuse it you remain here for days, if not  weeks. You cannot hope to obtain the preference unless you are enabled  to inform any one of the secret of setting the works in motion, and  then it would require a hand as steady and experienced as my own to  carry out your directions; and I should not undertake to do it except  on the conditions which I have named.\"    \"Show me the conditions drawn out,\" said Dumiger.    The man rolled out slowly one of the long strips of parchment which he  held in his hand; he gave it to Dumiger, who drew the lamp near him,  and for a few minutes reveled in the ideas of freedom and wealth. He  had but to say the word, and he enjoyed all that he had been laboring  for through life; but then, at what price? at that which it pained him  to contemplate--the citizenship of his native town, where his family  had dwelt respected for centuries. No doubt he was selling his  birthright; he was parting with all that a man should cling to in  adversity as in prosperity--that which is not to be purchased with  gold--all his old ties, his affections, his faith. Once signed, the  deed was irrevocable; and yet if he did not sign, what had he to hope  for?    He leaned his head on his hands, in one of those stern struggles which  age a man in a few minutes, as breaths of frost wither the freshest  leaves. He invoked the Spirit of Love--he called forth Marguerite, and  she stood beside him. He saw her with her cheek paler than when he had  parted from her; he saw her bosom heaving with sighs instead of love;  he heard her soft whisper in his ear, and he thought that whisper  expressed assent--that for him, she too was willing to relinquish the  home and the friends of her childhood. Ay, is it not ever so? Invoke  whom we may in hours of trial, does not the oracle take its tone from  our own wishes? Fond and futile pretense to invoke the Spirit of Love  to decide where love is interested! As Marguerite seemed to stand  beside Dumiger he lost sight of ambition, and all its pomp and  circumstance; all he asked was to be free.    \"Give me the paper,\" he said in a firm voice: \"the clock is yours, and  the principle of the movement is to be found engraved on a small plate  under the mainspring.\"    If he had seen the smile of triumph which passed over that man's  countenance, he would have hesitated.    The deed was done: the man put his materials and his paper into his  pocket again.    \"Now,\" he said, rising to go, \"the third day's post will find you  free; and take my advice, leave Dantzic soon. The people will be  irritated at being deprived of their master-piece. I would not have  you trust to their render mercies; for that matter, it is well for  you that you are safe in prison. Remember this advice, for I know the  Dantzickers as well as you do.\"    \"Stay, stay one moment,\" cried Dumiger, as the stranger was about to  leave the cell, \"who told you so much about me? How did you obtain  this list of debts? How came you to hear of Marguerite, and Carl, and  Krantz? Surely,\" and he passed his hand across his brow like a man who  is pained by the intensity of a ray of light after having been long in  darkness--\"tell me before you go, what does this mean?\" And he caught  a firm hold of the man's cloak.    \"There is no reason why I should not tell you the truth now,\" said  he, buttoning his coat tightly over the papers. \"I was sent for by the  Grand Master, who engaged me to obtain the sale of your clock at any  price. And he gave me good inducements to undertake the job.\"    The whole scheme broke on Dumiger's mind.    \"And with what object?\" he gasped forth; \"tell me that.\"    \"To get rid of your competition,\" said the man quietly. \"After yours  there is no doubt that his son's is the best; and, therefore, when  yours is sold to Hambro', his will be prized in Dantzic. As for me,  I shall get rewarded for my exertions, both by the Grand Master your  noble count, and my own city. Here is the truth of the matter,\" said  he; \"now let me go.\"    \"Let you go, miscreant!\" exclaimed Dumiger, \"never, until you return  me that paper. Let you go! I will follow you to death rather. You  betrayed me into this act; it was not my own free will. I am "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#16)"],[1,"I tell her how harmless the torrent is lookin'.\" He held out to  his pony a slice of bread matted with sardines, which the pony expertly  accepted. \"You're a plumb pie-biter you Monte,\" he continued. Monte  rubbed his nose on his master's shoulder. \"I wouldn't trust you with  berries and cream. No, seh; not though yu' did rescue a drownin' lady.\"    Presently he tightened the forward cinch, got in the saddle, and the  pony fell into his wise mechanical jog; for he had come a long way, and  was going a long way, and he knew this as well as the man did.    To use the language of Cattle Land, steers had \"jumped to seventy-five.\"  This was a great and prosperous leap in their value. To have flourished  in that golden time you need not be dead now, nor even middle-aged; but  it is Wyoming mythology already--quite as fabulous as the high-jumping  cow. Indeed, people gathered together and behaved themselves much in  the same pleasant and improbable way. Johnson County, and Natrona, and  Converse, and others, to say nothing of the Cheyenne Club, had been  jumping over the moon for some weeks, all on account of steers; and  on the strength of this vigorous price of seventy-five, the Stanton  Brothers were giving a barbecue at the Goose Egg outfit, their ranch on  Bear Creek. Of course the whole neighborhood was bidden, and would come  forty miles to a man; some would come further--the Virginian was coming  a hundred and eighteen. It had struck him--rather suddenly, as shall be  made plain--that he should like to see how they were getting along up  there on Bear Creek. \"They,\" was how he put it to his acquaintances. His  acquaintances did not know that he had bought himself a pair of trousers  and a scarf, unnecessarily excellent for such a general visit. They  did not know that in the spring, two days after the adventure with the  stage, he had learned accidentally who the lady in the stage was. This  he had kept to himself; nor did the camp ever notice that he had ceased  to sing that eightieth stanza he had made about the A B C--the stanza  which was not printable. He effaced it imperceptibly, giving the boys  the other seventy-nine at judicious intervals. They dreamed of no guile,  but merely saw in him, whether frequenting camp or town, the same not  over-angelic comrade whom they valued and could not wholly understand.    All spring he had ridden trail, worked at ditches during summer, and  now he had just finished with the beef round-up. Yesterday, while he was  spending a little comfortable money at the Drybone hog-ranch, a casual  traveller from the north gossiped of Bear Creek, and the fences up  there, and the farm crops, the Westfalls, and the young schoolmarm from  Vermont, for whom the Taylors had built a cabin next door to theirs. The  traveller had not seen her, but Mrs. Taylor and all the ladies thought  the world of her, and Lin McLean had told him she was \"away up in G.\"  She would have plenty of partners at this Swinton barbecue. Great boon  for the country, wasn't it, steers jumping that way?    The Virginian heard, asking no questions; and left town in an hour,  with the scarf and trousers tied in his slicker behind his saddle. After  looking upon the ford again, even though it was dry and not at all the  same place, he journeyed in attentively. When you have been hard at  work for months with no time to think, of course you think a great deal  during your first empty days. \"Step along, you Monte hawss!\" he said,  rousing after some while. He disciplined Monte, who flattened his ears  affectedly and snorted. \"Why, you surely ain' thinkin' of you'-self as  a hero? She wasn't really a-drowndin', you pie-biter.\" He rested his  serious glance upon the alkali. \"She's not likely to have forgot that  mix-up, though. I guess I'll not remind her about grippin' me, and all  that. She wasn't the kind a man ought to josh about such things. She had  a right clear eye.\" Thus, tall and loose in the saddle, did he jog along  the sixty miles which still lay between him and the dance.          X. WHERE FANCY WAS BRED      Two camps in the open, and the Virginian's Monte horse, untired, brought  him to the Swintons' in good time for the barbecue. The horse received  good food at length, while his rider was welcomed with good whiskey.  GOOD whiskey--for had not steers jumped to seventy-five?    Inside the Goose Egg kitchen many small delicacies were preparing, and  a steer was roasting whole outside. The bed of flame under it showed  steadily brighter against the dusk that was beginning to veil the  lowlands. The busy hosts went and came, while men stood and men lay near  the fire-glow. Chalkeye was there, and Nebrasky, and Trampas, and  Honey Wiggin, with others, enjoying the occasion; but Honey Wiggin was  enjoying himself: he had an audience; he was sitting up discoursing to  it.    \"Hello!\" he said, perceiving the Virginian. \"So you've dropped in for  your turn! Number--six, ain't he, boys?\"    \"Depends who's a-runnin' the countin',\" said the Virginian, and  stretched himself down among the audience.    \"I've saw him number one when nobody else was around,\" said Trampas.    \"How far away was you standin' when you beheld that?\" inquired the  lounging Southerner.    \"Well, boys,\" said Wiggin, \"I expect it will be Miss Schoolmarm says  who's number one to-night.\"    \"So she's arrived in this hyeh country?\" observed the Virginian, very  casually.    \"Arrived!\" said Trampas again. \"Where have you been grazing lately?\"    \"A right smart way from the mules.\"    \"Nebrasky and the boys was tellin' me they'd missed yu' off the range,\"  again interposed Wiggin. \"Say, Nebrasky, who have yu' offered your  canary to the schoolmarm said you mustn't give her?\"    Nebrasky grinned wretchedly.    \"Well, she's a lady, and she's square, not takin' a man's gift when she  don't take the man. But you'd ought to get back all them letters yu'  wrote her. Yu' sure ought to ask her for them tell-tales.\"    \"Ah, pshaw, Honey!\" protested the youth. It was well known that he could  not write his name.    \"Why, if here ain't Bokay Baldy!\" cried the agile Wiggin, stooping to  fresh prey. \"Found them slippers yet, Baldy? Tell yu' boys, that was  turruble sad luck Baldy had. Did yu' hear about that? Baldy, yu' know,  he can stay on a tame horse most as well as the schoolmarm. But just you  give him a pair of young knittin'-needles and see him make 'em sweat!  He worked an elegant pair of slippers with pink cabbages on 'em for Miss  Wood.\"    \"I bought 'em at Medicine Bow,\" blundered Baldy.    \"So yu' did!\" assented the skilful comedian. \"Baldy he bought 'em. And  on the road to her cabin there at the Taylors' he got thinkin' they  might be too big, and he got studyin' what to do. And he fixed up to  tell her about his not bein' sure of the size, and how she was to let  him know if they dropped off her, and he'd exchange 'em, and when he  got right near her door, why, he couldn't find his courage. And so he  slips the parcel under the fence and starts serenadin' her. But she  ain't inside her cabin at all. She's at supper next door with the  Taylors, and Baldy singin' 'Love has conqwered pride and angwer' to a  lone house. Lin McLean was comin' up by Taylor's corral, where Taylor's  Texas bull was. Well, it was turruble sad. Baldy's pants got tore, but  he fell inside the fence, and Lin druv the bull back and somebody stole  them Medicine Bow galoshes. Are you goin' to knit her some more, Bokay?\"    \"About half that ain't straight,\" Baldy commented, with mildness.    \"The half that was tore off yer pants? Well, never mind, Baldy; Lin will  get left too, same as all of yu'.\"    \"Is there many?\" inquired the Virginian. He was still stretched on his  back, looking up at the sky.    \"I don't know how many she's been used to where she was raised,\" Wiggin  answered. \"A kid stage-driver come from Point of Rocks one day and went  back the next. Then the foreman of the 76 outfit, and the horse-wrangler  from the Bar-Circle-L, and two deputy marshals, with punchers, stringin'  right along,--all got their tumble. Old Judge Burrage from Cheyenne come  up in August for a hunt and stayed round here and never hunted at all.  There was that horse thief--awful good-lookin'. Taylor wanted to warn  her about him, but Mrs. Taylor said she'd look after her if it was  needed. Mr. Horse-thief gave it up quicker than most; but the schoolmarm  couldn't have knowed he had a Mrs. Horse-thief camped on Poison Spider  till afterwards. She wouldn't go ridin' with him. She'll go with some,  takin' a kid along.\"    \"Bah!\" said Trampas.    The Virginian stopped looking at the sky, and watched Trampas from where  he lay.    \"I think she encourages a man some,\" said poor Nebrasky.    \"Encourages? Because she lets yu' teach her how to shoot,\" said Wiggin.  \"Well--I don't guess I'm a judge. I've always kind o' kep' away from  them good women. Don't seem to think of anything to chat about to 'em.  The only folks I'd say she encourages is the school kids. She kisses  them.\"    \"Riding and shooting and kissing the kids,\" sneered Trampas. \"That's a  heap too pussy-kitten for me.\"    They laughed. The sage-brush audience is readily cynical.    \"Look for the man, I say,\" Trampas pursued. \"And ain't he there? She  leaves Baldy sit on the fence while she and Lin McLean--\"    They laughed loudly at the blackguard picture which he drew; and the  laugh stopped short, for the Virginian stood over Trampas.    \"You can rise up now, and tell them you lie,\" he said.    The man was still for a moment in the dead silence. \"I thought you  claimed you and her wasn't acquainted,\" said he then.    \"Stand on your laigs, you polecat, and say you're a liar!\"    Trampas's hand moved behind him.    \"Quit that,\" said the Southerner, \"or I'll break your neck!\"    The eye of a man is the prince of deadly weapons. Trampas looked in the  Virginian's, and slowly rose. \"I didn't mean--\" he began, and paused,  his "]]]
