BRAITHWAITE, or BRATHWAITE, RICHARD (1588-1673).--Poet, _b._ near Kendal,  and _ed._ at Oxf., is believed to have served with the Royalist army in  the Civil War. He was the author of many works of very unequal merit, of  which the best known is _Drunken Barnaby's Four Journeys_, which records  his pilgrimages through England in rhymed Latin (said by Southey to be  the best of modern times), and doggerel English verse. _The English  Gentleman_ (1631) and _English Gentlewoman_ are in a much more decorous  strain. Other works are _The Golden Fleece_ (1611) (poems), _The Poet's  Willow_, _A Strappado for the Devil_ (a satire), and _Art Asleepe,  Husband?_      BRAMSTON, JAMES (_c._ 1694-1744).--Satirist, _ed._ at Westminster School  and Oxf., took orders and was latterly Vicar of Hastings. His poems are  _The Art of Politics_ (1729), in imitation of Horace, and _The Man of  Taste_ (1733), in imitation of Pope. He also parodied Phillips's  _Splendid Shilling_ in _The Crooked Sixpence_. His verses have some  liveliness.      BRAY, ANNA ELIZA (1790-1883).--Novelist, _dau._ of Mr. J. Kempe, was  married first to C.A. Stothard, _s._ of the famous R.A., and himself an  artist, and secondly to the Rev. E.A. Bray. She wrote about a dozen  novels, chiefly historical, and _The Borders of the Tamar and Tavy_  (1836), an account of the traditions and superstitions of the  neighbourhood of Tavistock in the form of letters to Southey, of whom she  was a great friend. This is probably the most valuable of her writings.  Among her works are _Branded_, _Good St. Louis and his Times_,  _Trelawney_, and _White Hoods_.      BRETON, NICHOLAS (1545-1626).--Poet and novelist. Little is known of his  life. He was the _s._ of William B., a London merchant, was perhaps at  Oxf., and was a rather prolific author of considerable versatility and  gift. Among his poetical works are _A Floorish upon Fancie, Pasquil's  Mad-cappe_ (1626), _The Soul's Heavenly Exercise_, and _The Passionate  Shepherd_. In prose he wrote _Wit's Trenchmour_, _The Wil of Wit_ (1599),  _A Mad World, my Masters_, _Adventures of Two Excellent Princes_,  _Grimello's Fortunes_ (1604), _Strange News out of Divers Countries_  (1622), etc. His mother married E. Gascoigne, the poet (_q.v._). His  lyrics are pure and fresh, and his romances, though full of conceits, are  pleasant reading, remarkably free from grossness.      BREWSTER, SIR DAVID (1781-1868).--Man of science and writer, _b._ at  Jedburgh, originally intended to enter the Church, of which, after a  distinguished course at the Univ. of Edin., he became a licentiate.  Circumstances, however, led him to devote himself to science, of which he  was one of the most brilliant ornaments of his day, especially in the  department of optics, in which he made many discoveries. He maintained  his habits of investigation and composition to the very end of his long  life, during which he received almost every kind of honorary distinction  open to a man of science. He also made many important contributions to  literature, including a _Life of Newton_ (1831), _The Martyrs of Science_  (1841), _More Worlds than One_ (1854), and _Letters on Natural Magic_  addressed to Sir W. Scott, and he also edited, in addition to various  scientific journals, _The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia_ (1807-29). He likewise  held the offices successively of Principal of the United Coll. of St.  Salvator and St. Leonard, St. Andrews (1838), and of the Univ. of Edin.  (1859). He was knighted in 1831. Of high-strung and nervous temperament,  he was somewhat irritable in matters of controversy; but he was  repeatedly subjected to serious provocation. He was a man of highly  honourable and fervently religious character.      BROKE, or BROOKE, ARTHUR (_d._ 1563).--Translator, was the author of _The  Tragicall Historie of Romeus and Juliett_, from which Shakespeare  probably took the story of his _Romeo and Juliet_. Though indirectly  translated, through a French version, from the Italian of Bandello, it is  so much altered and amplified as almost to rank as an original work. The  only fact known regarding him is his death by shipwreck when crossing to  France.      BROME, RICHARD (_d._ 1652?).--Dramatist, the servant and friend of Ben  Jonson, produced upwards of 20 plays, some in conjunction with Dekker and  others. Among them are _A Fault in Friendship_, _Late Lancashire Witches_  (with Heywood and Dekker), _A Jovial Crew_ (1652), _The Northern Lass_  (1632), _The Antipodes_ (1646), _City Wit_ (1653), _Court Beggar_ (1653),  etc. He had no original genius, but knew stage-craft well.      BRONTE, CHARLOTTE (1816-1855).--Novelist, _dau._ of the Rev. Patrick B.,  a clergyman of Irish descent and of eccentric habits who embittered the  lives of his children by his peculiar theories of education. Brought up  in a small parsonage close to the graveyard of a bleak, windswept village  on the Yorkshire moors, and left motherless in early childhood, she was  \"the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters,\" of whom two,  Emily and Anne, shared, but in a less degree, her talents. After various  efforts as schoolmistresses and governesses, the sisters took to  literature and _pub._ a vol. of poems under the names of Currer, Ellis,  and Acton Bell, which, however, fell flat. Charlotte then wrote her first  novel, _The Professor_, which did not appear until after her death, and  began _Jane Eyre_, which, appearing in 1847, took the public by storm. It  was followed by _Shirley_ in 1849, and _Villette_ in 1852. In 1854 she  was married to her father's curate, the Rev. A. Nicholls, but after a  short though happy married life she _d._ in 1855. EMILY B.  (1818-1848).--a woman of remarkable force of character, reserved and  taciturn, _pub._ in 1848 _Wuthering Heights_, a powerful, but somewhat  unpleasing, novel, and some striking poems; and ANNE (1820-1849), was the  authoress of _The Tenant of Wildfell Hall_ and _Agnes Grey_ (1848). She  had not the intellectual force of her sisters. The novels of Charlotte  especially created a strong impression from the first, and the _pub._ of  _Jane Eyre_ gave rise to much curiosity and speculation as to its  authorship. Their strength and originality have retained for them a high  place in English fiction which is likely to prove permanent. There is a  biography of Charlotte by Mrs. Gaskell (_q.v._).    Complete ed. of the works of Charlotte B. have been issued by Mrs.  Humphrey Ward (7 vols. 1899-1900), and by Sir W.R. Nicoll, LL.D. (1903).  _Note on Charlotte Bronte_, A.C. Swinburne, 1877. A short _Life_ in Great  Writers Series by A. Birrell.      BROOKE, FULKE GREVILLE, LORD (1554-1628).--Poet and statesman, _b._ at  Beauchamp Court, Warwickshire, and _ed._ at Shrewsbury and Camb., was a  Privy Councillor, and held various important offices of state, including  that of Chancellor of the Exchequer (1614-21). In the latter year he was  created a peer. He was murdered by a servant. His works, which were  chiefly _pub._ after his death, consist of tragedies and sonnets, and  poems on political and moral subjects, including _Caelica_ (109 sonnets).  He also wrote a Life of Sir P. Sidney, whose friend he was. His style is  grave and sententious. He is buried in the church at Warwick, and the  inscription on his tomb, written by himself, is a compendious biography.  It runs: \"Fulke Greville, servant to Queen Elizabeth, counsellor to King  James, friend to Sir Philip Sidney.\"      BROOKE, HENRY (1703-1783).--Novelist and dramatist, _b._ in Ireland, _s._  of a clergyman, studied law, but embraced literature as a career. He  wrote poems, dramas, and novels; but the only work which has kept its  place is _The Fool of Quality_ (5 vols. 1766-70), which was a favourite  book with John Wesley. His now forgotten poem, _Universal Beauty_ (1735)  was admired by Pope. His _dau._, CHARLOTTE, the only survivor of 22  children, tended him to his last days of decay, and was herself a writer,  her principal work being _Reliques of Irish Poetry_ (1789). She _d._  1793.      BROOKS, CHARLES WILLIAM SHIRLEY (1816-1874).--Journalist and novelist,  _b._ in London, began life in a solicitor's office. He early, however,  took to literature, and contributed to various periodicals. In 1851 he  joined the staff of _Punch_, to which he contributed \"Essence of  Parliament,\" and on the death of Mark Lemon (_q.v._) he succeeded him as  editor. He _pub._ a few novels, including _Aspen Court_ and _The Gordian  Knot_.      BROOKS, MARIA (GOWAN) (1795?-1845).--American poetess, was early _m._ to  a merchant, who lost his money, and left her a young widow, after which  she wrote highly romantic and impassioned poetry. Her chief work,  _Zophiel or The Bride of Swen_, was finished under the auspices of  Southey, who called her \"Maria del Occidente,\" and regarded her as \"the  most impassioned and imaginative of all poetesses,\" but time has not  sustained this verdict.      BROOME, WILLIAM (1689-1745).--Poet and translator, _b._ at Haslington,  Cheshire, and _ed._ at Eton and Camb., entered the Church, and held  various incumbencies. He translated the _Iliad_ in prose along with  others, and was employed by Pope, whom he excelled as a Greek scholar, in  translating the _Odyssey_, of which he Englished the 8th, 11th, 12th,  16th, 18th, and 23rd books, catching the style of his master so exactly  as almost to defy identification, and thus annoying him so as to earn a  niche in _The Dunciad_. He _pub._ verses of his own of very moderate  poetical merit.      BROUGHAM AND VAUX, HENRY, 1ST LORD (1778-1868).--_S._ of Henry B. of  Brougham Hall, Westmoreland, _b._ in Edin., and _ed._ at the High School  and Univ. there, where he distinguished himself chiefly in mathematics.  He chose a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#16)"],[1,"may look very like seeking custom, I would advise you  to keep your present quarters. You know the old saying, 'Men may  go farther and fare worse.' I had a lamb killed when I heard of the  rising, and specially for your honor's dinner. Just look into the barn  as ye pass. Upon my conscience! it's a curiosity!\"    He turned back with me; but before we reached the place, the dark  stranger I had seen before beckoned from a back window.    \"Ha! an old and worthy customer wants me.\"    Placing his crooked finger in his mouth. he gave a loud and piercing  whistle. The _quondam_ whipper appeared at a stable-door with a  horse-brush in his hand.    \"Pat, show his honor that born beauty I killed for him this morning.\"    \"Coming, Mr. Scully--I beg ye'r honor's pardon--but ye know that  business must be minded,\" he said, and hurried off.    No man assumes the semblance of indifference, and masks his feelings  more readily than an Irishman, and Pat Loftus was no exception to his  countrymen. When summoned by the host's whistle, he came to the door  lilting a planxty merrily,--but when he re-entered the stable, the  melody ceased, and his countenance became serious.    \"I hid behind the straw, yonder, Colonel, and overheard every syllable  that passed, and under the canopy bigger villains are not than the two  who are together now. There's no time for talking--all's ready,\" and  he pointed to the harnessed post-horses, \"Go in, keep an eye open, and  close mouth--order the carriage round--all is packed--and when we're  clear of the town I'll tell you more.\"    When my father's determination was made known, feelingly did the host  indicate the danger of the attempt, and to his friendly remonstrances  against wayfaring, Mr. Scully raised a warning voice. But my father  was decisive--Pat Loftus trotted to the door--some light luggage was  placed in the carriage, and three brace of pistols deposited in its  pockets. A meaning look was interchanged between the innkeeper and his  fellow-guest.    \"Colonel,\" said the former, \"I hope you will not need the tools. If  you do, the fault will be all your own.\"    \"If required,\" returned my father, \"I'll use them to the best  advantage.\"    The villains interchanged a smile.    \"Pat,\" said the host to the postillion, \"you know the safest road--do  what I bid ye--and keep his honor out of trouble if ye can.\"    \"Go on,\" shouted my father--the whip cracked smartly, and off rolled  the carriage.    For half a mile we proceeded at a smart pace, until at the junction of  the three roads, Loftus took the one which the finger-post indicated  was not the Dublin one. My father called out to stop, but the  postillion hurried on, until high hedges, and a row of ash-trees at  both sides, shut in the view. He pulled up suddenly.    \"Am I not an undutiful servant to disobey the orders of so good  a master as Mr. Dogherty? First, I have not taken the road he  recommended--and, secondly, instead of driving this flint into a  horse's frog, I have carried it in my pocket,\" and he jerked the stone  away.    \"Look to your pistols, Colonel. In good old times your arms, I  suspect, would have been found in better order.\"    The weapons were examined, and every pan had been saturated with  water. \"Never mind, I'll clean them well at night: it's not the first  time. But, see the dust yonder! I dare not turn back, and I am half  afraid to go on. Ha--glory to the Virgin! dragoons, ay, and, as I see  now, they are escorting Lord Arlington's coach. Have we not the luck  of thousands?\"    He cracked his whip, and at the junction of a cross-road fell in with  and joined the travelers. My father was well known to his lordship,  who expressed much pleasure that the journey to the capital should be  made in company.    Protected by relays of cavalry, we reached the city in safety, not,  however, without one or two hair-breadth escapes from molestation.  Everything around told that the insurrection had broken out:  church-bells rang, dropping shots now and then were heard, and houses,  not very distant, were wrapped in flames. Safely, however, we passed  through manifold alarms, and at dusk entered the fortified barrier  erected on one of the canal bridges, which was jealously guarded by a  company of Highlanders and two six-pounders. Brief shall be a summary  of what followed. While the tempest of rebellion raged, we remained  safely in the capital. Constance and I were over head and ears in  love; but another passion struggled with me for mastery. Youth is  always pugnacious; like Norval,      \"I had heard of battles, and had longed    To follow to the field some warlike\"    colonel of militia, and importuned my father to obtain a commission,  and, like Laertes, \"wrung a slow consent.\" The application was made;  and, soon after breakfast, the butler announced that my presence was  wanted in the drawing-room. I repaired thither, and there found my  father, his fair dame, and my cousin Constance.    \"Well, Frank, I have kept my promise, and, in a day or two, I shall  have a captain's commission for you. Before, however, I place myself  under an obligation to Lord Carhampton, let me propose an alternative  for your selection.\"    I shook my head. \"And what may that be, sir?\"    \"A wife.\"    \"A wife!\" I exclaimed.    \"Yes, that is the plain offer. You shall have, however, a free liberty  of election: read that letter.\"    I threw my eye over it hastily. It was from the Lord Lieutenant's  secretary, to say that his excellency felt pleasure in placing a  company in the ---- militia, at Colonel Hamilton's disposal. \"There is  the road to fame open as a turnpike trust. Come hither, Constance, and  here is the alternative.\" She looked at me archly, I caught her to my  heart, and kissed her red lips.    \"Father!\"    \"Well, Frank.\"    \"You may write a polite letter to the Castle, and decline the  commission.\"    Half a century has passed, but ninety-eight is still, by oral  communications, well known to the Irish peasant; and would that its  horrors carried with them salutary reminiscences! But to my own story.    Instead of fattening beeves, planting trees, clapping vagabonds \"i'  th' stocks,\" and doing all and everything that appertaineth to a  country gentleman, and also, the queen's poor esquire, I might have,  until the downfall of Napoleon, and the reduction of the militia,  events cotemporaneous, smelt powder on the Phoenix Park on field days,  and like Hudibras, of pleasant memory, at the head of a charge of  foot, \"rode forth a coloneling.\" In place, however, of meddling with  cold iron, I yielded to \"metal more attractive,\" and in three months  became a Benedict, and in some dozen more a papa.    In the mean time, rebellion was bloodily put down, and on my lady's  recovery, my father, whose yearning for a return to the old roof-tree  was irresistible, prepared for our departure from the metropolis.    Curiously enough, we passed through Prosperous, exactly on the  anniversary of the day when we had so providentially effected an  invasion from certain destruction. Were aught required to elicit  gratitude for a fortunate escape, two objects, and both visible  from the inn windows, would have been sufficient. One was a mass  of blackened ruins--the scathed walls of the barrack, in which the  wretched garrison had been so barbarously done to death: the other  a human head impaled upon a spike on the gable of the building. That  blanched skull had rested on the shoulders of our traitor host, and  we, doomed to \"midnight murder,\" were mercifully destined to witness a  repulsive, but just evidence, that Providence interposes often between  the villain and the victim.    I am certain that in my physical construction, were an analysis  practicable, small would be the amount of heroic proportions which  the most astute operator would detect. I may confess the truth, and  say, that in \"lang syne,\" any transient ebullition of military ardor  vanished at a glance from Constance's black eye. The stream of time  swept on, and those that were, united their dust with those that had  been. In a short time my letter of readiness may be expected; and I  shall, in nature's course, after the last march, as Byron says, ere  long      \"Take my rest.\"    And will the succession end with me? Tell it not to Malthes, nor  whisper it to Harriet Martineau. There is no prospect of advertising  for the next of kin, i.e. if five strapping boys and a couple of the  fair sex may be considered a sufficient security.

All were glad to welcome the adventurous trader from Yakoutsk; and  when he intimated that his boxes of treasure, his brandy and tea, and  rum and tobacco, were to be laid out in the hire of dogs and sledges,  he found ample applicants, though, from the very first, all refused  to accompany his party as guardians of the dogs. Sakalar, however,  who had expected this, was nothing daunted, but, bidding Ivan amuse  himself as best he could, undertook all the preparations.
