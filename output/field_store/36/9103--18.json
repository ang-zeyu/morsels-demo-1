What seemed chiefly to  concern him, what apparently had brought him back to life, was the  hacking at his tail. That was an indignity he could not brook.    His expression, and he had a perfectly human expression, was one of  extreme annoyance and of some slight alarm, as though he were  muttering: \"This is no place for _me_,\" and, without more ado, he  began to roll toward the river. Without killing some one, I could  not again use the rifle. The boys were close upon him, prying him  back with the gangplank, beating him with sticks of firewood, trying  to rope him with the steel hawser. On the bridge Captain Jensen and  Anfossi were giving orders in Danish and Italian, and on the bank I  swore in American. Everybody shoved and pushed and beat at the great  bulk, and the great bulk rolled steadily on. We might as well have  tried to budge the Fifth Avenue Hotel. He reached the bank, he  crushed it beneath him, and, like a suspension bridge, splashed into  the water. Even then, we who watched him thought he would stick fast  between the boat and the bank, that the hawser would hold him. But  he sank like a submarine, and we stood gaping at the muddy water and  saw him no more. When I recovered from my first rage I was glad he  was still alive to float in the sun and puff and blow and open his  great jaws in a luxurious yawn. I could imagine his joining his  friends after his meeting with us, and remarking in reference to our  bullets: \"I find the mosquitoes are quite bad this morning.\"    With this chapter is published the photograph Anfossi took, from the  deck of the steamer, of our hippo--the hippo that was too stupid to  know when he was dead. It is not a good photograph, but of our hippo  it is all we have to show. I am still undecided whether to hang it  in the hall or the dining-room.     [Illustration: The Hippopotamus that Did Not Know He Was Dead.]    The days I spent on my trip up the river were of delightful  sameness, sunshine by day, with the great panorama drifting past,  and quiet nights of moonlight. For diversion, there were many  hippos, crocodiles, and monkeys, and, though we saw only their  tracks and heard them only in the jungle, great elephants. And  innumerable strange birds--egrets, eagles, gray parrots, crimson  cranes, and giant flamingoes--as tall as a man and from tip to tip  measuring eight feet.    Each day the programme was the same. The arrival at the wood post,  where we were given only excuses and no wood, and where once or  twice we unloaded blue cloth and bags of salt, which is the currency  of the Upper Congo, and the halt for hours to cut wood in the  forest.    Once we stopped at a mission and noted the contrast it made with the  bare, unkempt posts of the State. It was the Catholic mission at  Wombali, and it was a beauty spot of flowers, thatched houses,  grass, and vegetables. There was a brickyard, and schools, and  sewing-machines, and the blacks, instead of scowling at us, nodded  and smiled and looked happy and contented. The Father was a great  red-bearded giant, who seemed to have still stored up in him all the  energy of the North. While the steamer was unloaded he raced me  over the vegetable garden and showed me his farm. I had seen other  of the Catholic Missions, and I spoke of how well they looked, of  the signs they gave of hard work, and of consideration for the  blacks.    \"I am not of that Order,\" the Father said gravely. He was speaking  in English, and added, as though he expected some one to resent it:  \"We are Jesuits.\" No one resented it, and he added: \"We have our  Order in your country. Do you know Fordham College?\"    Did I know it? If you are trying to find our farm, the automobile  book tells you to leave Fordham College on your left after Jerome  Avenue.    \"Of course, I know it,\" I said. \"They have one of the best baseball  nines near New York; they play the Giants every spring.\"    The Reverend Father started.    \"They play with Giants!\" he gasped.    I did not know how to say \"baseball nines\" in French, but at least  he was assured that whatever it was, it was one of the best near New  York.    Then Captain Jensen's little black boy ran up to tell me the  steamer was waiting, and began in Bangalese to beg something of the  Father. The priest smiled and left us, returning with a rosary and  crucifix, which the boy hung round his neck, and then knelt, and the  red-bearded Father laid his fingers on the boy's kinky head. He was  a very happy boy over his new possession, and it was much coveted by  all the others. One of the black mammies, to ward off evil from the  little naked baby at her breast, offered an arm's length of blue  cloth for \"the White Man's fetish.\"     [Illustration: The Jesuit Brothers at the Wombali Mission.]    My voyage up the Kasai ended at Dima, the headquarters of the Kasai  Concession. I had been told that at Dima I would find a rubber  plantation, and I had gone there to see it. I found that the  plantation was four days distant, and that the boat for the  plantation did not start for six days. I also had been told by the  English missionaries at Dima, that I would find an American mission.  When I reached Dima I learned that the American mission was at a  station further up the river, which could not be reached sooner than  a month. That is the sort of information upon which in the Congo  one is forced to regulate his movements. As there was at Dima  neither mission nor plantation, and as the only boat that would  leave it in ten days was departing the next morning, I remained  there only one night. It was a place cut out of the jungle, two  hundred yards square, and of all stations I saw in the Congo, the  best managed. It is the repair shop for the steamers belonging to  the Kasai Concession, as well as the headquarters of the company and  the residence of the director, M. Dryepoint. He and Van Damme seemed  to be the most popular officials in the Congo. M. Dryepoint was up  the river, so I did not meet him, but I was most courteously and  hospitably entertained by M. Fumiere. He gave me a whole house to  myself, and personally showed me over his small kingdom. All the  houses were of brick, and the paths and roads were covered with  gravel and lined with flowers. Nothing in the Congo is more curious  than this pretty town of suburban villas and orderly machine shops;  with the muddy river for a street and the impenetrable jungle for a  back yard. The home of the director at Dima is the proud boast of  the entire Congo. And all they say of it is true. It did have a  billiard table and ice, and a piano, and M. Fumiere invited me to  join his friends at an excellent dinner. In furnishing this  celebrated house, the idea had apparently been to place in it the  things one would least expect to find in the jungle, or, without  wishing to be ungracious, anywhere. So, although there are no women  at Dima, there are great mirrors in brass frames, chandeliers of  glass with festoons and pendants of glass, metal lamps with shades  of every color, painted plaster statuettes and carved silk-covered  chairs. In the red glow of the lamps, surrounded by these Belgian  atrocities, M. Fumiere sat down to the pianola. The heat of Africa  filled the room; on one side we could have touched the jungle, on  the other in the river the hippopotamus puffed and snorted. M.  Fumiere pulled out the stops, and upon the heat and silence of the  night, floated the \"Evening Star,\" Mascagni's \"Intermezzo,\" and  \"Chin-chin Chinaman.\"    Next morning I left for Leopoldville in a boat much larger than the  _Deliverance_, but with none of her cheer or good-fellowship. This  boat was run by the black wife of the captain. Trailing her velvet  gown, and cleaning her teeth with a stick of wood, she penetrated to  every part of the steamer, making discipline impossible and driving  the crew out of control.    I was glad to escape at Kinchassa to the clean and homelike bungalow  and beautiful gardens of the only Englishman still in the employ of  the State, Mr. Cuthbert Malet, who gave me hospitably of his scanty  store of \"Scotch,\" and, what was even more of a sacrifice, of his  precious handful of eggs. A week later I was again in Boma, waiting  for the _Nigeria_ to take me back to Liverpool.    Before returning to the West Coast and leaving the subject of the  Congo, I wish to testify to what seemed to me the enormously  important work that is being done by the missionaries. I am not  always an admirer of the missionary. Some of those one meets in  China and Japan seem to be taking much more interest in their own  bodies than in the souls of others. But, in the Congo, almost the  only people who are working in behalf of the natives are those  attached to the missions. Because they bear witness against Leopold,  much is said by his hired men and press agents against them. But  they are deserving of great praise. Some of them are narrow and  bigoted, and one could wish they were much more tolerant of their  white brothers in exile, but compared with the good they do, these  faults count for nothing. It is due to them that Europe and the  United States know the truth about the Congo. They were the first to  bear witness, and the hazardous work they still are doing for their  fellow men is honest, practical Christianity.          VI    OLD CALABAR      While I was up the Congo and the Kasai rivers, Mrs. Davis had  remained at Boma, and when I rejoined her, we booked passage home on  the _Nigeria_. We chose the _Nigeria_, which is an Elder-Dempster  freight and passenger steamer, in preference to the fast mail  steamer because of the ports of the West Coast we wished to see as  many as possible. And, on her six weeks' voyage to Liverpool, the  _Nigeria_ promised to spend as much time at anchor as at sea. On the  Coast it is a more serious matter to reserve a cabin than in New  York.

They were sisters, and their names were Adriana and  Luciana. Adriana was the wife of his brother Antipholus of Ephesus, and  she had made up her mind, from the strange account given her by Dromio  of Ephesus, that her husband preferred another woman to his wife. \"Ay,  you may look as if you did not know me,\" she said to the man who was  really her brother-in-law, \"but I can remember when no words were sweet  unless I said them, no meat flavorsome unless I carved it.\"    \"Is it I you address?\" said Antipholus of Syracuse stiffly. \"I do not  know you.\"    \"Fie, brother,\" said Luciana. \"You know perfectly well that she sent  Dromio to you to bid you come to dinner;\" and Adriana said, \"Come, come;  I have been made a fool of long enough. My truant husband shall dine  with me and confess his silly pranks and be forgiven.\"    They were determined ladies, and Antipholus of Syracuse grew weary of  disputing with them, and followed them obediently to The Phoenix, where  a very late \"mid-day\" dinner awaited them.    They were at dinner when Antipholus of Ephesus and his slave Dromio  demanded admittance. \"Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cecily, Gillian, Ginn!\"  shouted Dromio of Ephesus, who knew all his fellow-servants' names by  heart.    From within came the reply, \"Fool, dray-horse, coxcomb, idiot!\" It was  Dromio of Syracuse unconsciously insulting his brother.    Master and man did their best to get in, short of using a crowbar, and  finally went away; but Antipholus of Ephesus felt so annoyed with his  wife that he decided to give a gold chain which he had promised her, to  another woman.    Inside The Phoenix, Luciana, who believed Antipholus of Syracuse to be  her sister's husband, attempted, by a discourse in rhyme, when alone  with him, to make him kinder to Adriana. In reply he told her that he  was not married, but that he loved her so much that, if Luciana were a  mermaid, he would gladly lie on the sea if he might feel beneath him her  floating golden hair.    Luciana was shocked and left him, and reported his lovemaking to  Adriana, who said that her husband was old and ugly, and not fit to be  seen or heard, though secretly she was very fond of him.    Antipholus of Syracuse soon received a visitor in the shape of Angelo  the goldsmith, of whom Antipholus of Ephesus had ordered the chain which  he had promised his wife and intended to give to another woman.    The goldsmith handed the chain to Antipholus of Syracuse, and treated  his \"I bespoke it not\" as mere fun, so that the puzzled merchant took  the chain as good-humoredly as he had partaken of Adriana's dinner. He  offered payment, but Angelo foolishly said he would call again.    The consequence was that Angelo was without money when a creditor of the  sort that stands no nonsense, threatened him with arrest unless he paid  his debt immediately. This creditor had brought a police officer with  him, and Angelo was relieved to see Antipholus of Ephesus coming out of  the house where he had been dining because he had been locked out of The  Phoenix. Bitter was Angelo's dismay when Antipholus denied receipt of  the chain. Angelo could have sent his mother to prison if she had said  that, and he gave Antipholus of Ephesus in charge.    At this moment up came Dromio of Syracuse and told the wrong Antipholus  that he had shipped his goods, and that a favorable wind was blowing.  To the ears of Antipholus of Ephesus this talk was simple nonsense. He  would gladly have beaten the slave, but contented himself with crossly  telling him to hurry to Adriana and bid her send to her arrested husband  a purse of money which she would find in his desk.    Though Adriana was furious with her husband because she thought he had  been making love to her sister, she did not prevent Luciana from  getting the purse, and she bade Dromio of Syracuse bring home his master  immediately.    Unfortunately, before Dromio could reach the police station he met his  real master, who had never been arrested, and did not understand what  he meant by offering him a purse. Antipholus of Syracuse was further  surprised when a lady whom he did not know asked him for a chain that he  had promised her. She was, of course, the lady with whom Antipholus of  Ephesus had dined when his brother was occupying his place at table.  \"Avaunt, thou witch!\" was the answer which, to her astonishment, she  received.    Meanwhile Antipholus of Ephesus waited vainly for the money which was  to have released him. Never a good-tempered man, he was crazy with anger  when Dromio of Ephesus, who, of course, had not been instructed to fetch  a purse, appeared with nothing more useful than a rope. He beat the  slave in the street despite the remonstrance of the police officer;  and his temper did not mend when Adriana, Luciana, and a doctor arrived  under the impression that he was mad and must have his pulse felt. He  raged so much that men came forward to bind him. But the kindness of  Adriana spared him this shame. She promised to pay the sum demanded of  him, and asked the doctor to lead him to The Phoenix.    Angelo's merchant creditor being paid, the two were friendly again,  and might soon have been seen chatting before an abbey about the odd  behavior of Antipholus of Ephesus. \"Softly,\" said the merchant at last,  \"that's he, I think.\"    It was not; it was Antipholus of Syracuse with his servant Dromio,  and he wore Angelo's chain round his neck! The reconciled pair fairly  pounced upon him to know what he meant by denying the receipt of the  chain he had the impudence to wear. Antipholus of Syracuse lost his  temper, and drew his sword, and at that moment Adriana and several  others appeared. \"Hold!\" shouted the careful wife. \"Hurt him not; he is  mad. Take his sword away. Bind him--and Dromio too.\"    Dromio of Syracuse did not wish to be bound, and he said to his master,  \"Run, master! Into that abbey, quick, or we shall be robbed!\"    They accordingly retreated into the abbey.    Adriana, Luciana, and a crowd remained outside, and the Abbess came out,  and said, \"People, why do you gather here?\"    \"To fetch my poor distracted husband,\" replied Adriana.    Angelo and the merchant remarked that they had not known that he was  mad.    Adriana then told the Abbess rather too much about her wifely worries,  for the Abbess received the idea that Adriana was a shrew, and that  if her husband was distracted he had better not return to her for the  present.    Adriana determined, therefore, to complain to Duke Solinus, and, lo and  behold! a minute afterwards the great man appeared with officers and two  others. The others were AEgeon and the headsman. The thousand marks had  not been found, and AEgeon's fate seemed sealed.    Ere the Duke could pass the abbey Adriana knelt before him, and told a  woeful tale of a mad husband rushing about stealing jewelry and drawing  his sword, adding that the Abbess refused to allow her to lead him home.    The Duke bade the Abbess be summoned, and no sooner had he given the  order than a servant from The Phoenix ran to Adriana with the tale that  his master had singed off the doctor's beard.    \"Nonsense!\" said Adriana, \"he's in the abbey.\"    \"As sure as I live I speak the truth,\" said the servant.    Antipholus of Syracuse had not come out of the abbey, before his  brother of Ephesus prostrated himself in front of the Duke, exclaiming,  \"Justice, most gracious Duke, against that woman.\" He pointed to  Adriana. \"She has treated another man like her husband in my own house.\"    Even while he was speaking AEgeon said, \"Unless I am delirious, I see my  son Antipholus.\"    No one noticed him, and Antipholus of Ephesus went on to say how the  doctor, whom he called \"a threadbare juggler,\" had been one of a gang  who tied him to his slave Dromio, and thrust them into a vault whence he  had escaped by gnawing through his bonds.    The Duke could not understand how the same man who spoke to him was  seen to go into the abbey, and he was still wondering when AEgeon asked  Antipholus of Ephesus if he was not his son. He replied, \"I never saw  my father in my life;\" but so deceived was AEgeon by his likeness to  the brother whom he had brought up, that he said, \"Thou art ashamed to  acknowledge me in misery.\"    Soon, however, the Abbess advanced with Antipholus of Syracuse and  Dromio of Syracuse.    Then cried Adriana, \"I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me;\" and  Antipholus, espying his father, said, \"Thou art AEgeon or his ghost.\"    It was a day of surprises, for the Abbess said, \"I will free that man by  paying his fine, and gain my husband whom I lost. Speak, AEgeon, for I  am thy wife AEmilia.\"    The Duke was touched. \"He is free without a fine,\" he said.    So AEgeon and AEmilia were reunited, and Adriana and her husband  reconciled; but no one was happier than Antipholus of Syracuse, who, in  the Duke's presence, went to Luciana and said, \"I told you I loved you.  Will you be my wife?\"    Her answer was given by a look, and therefore is not written.    The two Dromios were glad to think they would receive no more beatings.          THE MERCHANT OF VENICE        Antonio was a rich and prosperous merchant of Venice. His ships were  on nearly every sea, and he traded with Portugal, with Mexico, with  England, and with India. Although proud of his riches, he was very  generous with them, and delighted to use them in relieving the wants of  his friends, among whom his relation, Bassanio, held the first place.    Now Bassanio, like many another gay and gallant gentleman, was reckless  and extravagant, and finding that he had not only come to the end of his  fortune, but was also unable to pay his creditors, he went to Antonio  for further help.    \"To you, Antonio,\" he said, \"I owe the most in money and in love: and I  have thought of a plan to pay everything I owe if you will but help me.\"    \"Say"]]]
