He was used  to thinking in Spanish, and translating his ideas into the speech of his  ancestors spattered his French with all kinds of Creole dialect.    \"Where a man makes his fortune and raises his family, there is his true  country,\" he said sententiously, remembering Madariaga.    The image of that distant country dominated him with insistent obsession  as soon as the impressions of the voyage had worn off. He had no French  friends, and upon going into the street, his feet instinctively took him  to the places where the Argentinians gathered together. It was the same  with them. They had left their country only to feel, with increasing  intensity, the desire to talk about it all the time. There he read the  papers, commenting on the rising prices in the fields, on the prospects  for the next harvests and on the sales of cattle. Returning home, his  thoughts were still in America, and he chuckled with delight as he  recalled the way in which the two chinas had defied the professional  dignity of the French cook, preparing their native stews and other  dishes in Creole style.    He had settled the family in an ostentatious house in the avenida Victor  Hugo, for which he paid a rental of twenty-eight thousand francs. Dona  Luisa had to go and come many times before she could accustom herself to  the imposing aspect of the concierges--he, decorated with gold trimmings  on his black uniform and wearing white whiskers like a notary in a  comedy, she with a chain of gold upon her exuberant bosom, and receiving  the tenants in a red and gold salon. In the rooms above was ultra-modern  luxury, gilded and glacial, with white walls and glass doors with  tiny panes which exasperated Desnoyers, who longed for the complicated  carvings and rich furniture in vogue during his youth. He himself  directed the arrangement and furnishings of the various rooms which  always seemed empty.    Chichi protested against her father's avarice when she saw him buying  slowly and with much calculation and hesitation. \"Avarice, no!\" he  retorted, \"it is because I know the worth of things.\"    Nothing pleased him that he had not acquired at one-third of its value.  Beating down those who overcharged but proved the superiority of the  buyer. Paris offered him one delightful spot which he could not find  anywhere else in the world--the Hotel Drouot. He would go there every  afternoon that he did not find other important auctions advertised in  the papers. For many years, there was no famous failure in Parisian  life, with its consequent liquidation, from which he did not carry  something away. The use and need of these prizes were matters of  secondary interest, the great thing was to get them for ridiculous  prices. So the trophies from the auction-rooms now began to inundate  the apartment which, at the beginning, he had been furnishing with such  desperate slowness.    His daughter now complained that the home was getting overcrowded. The  furnishings and ornaments were handsome, but too many . . . far too  many! The white walls seemed to scowl at the magnificent sets of chairs  and the overflowing glass cabinets. Rich and velvety carpets over  which had passed many generations, covered all the compartments. Showy  curtains, not finding a vacant frame in the salons, adorned the doors  leading into the kitchen. The wall mouldings gradually disappeared  under an overlay of pictures, placed close together like the scales of  a cuirass. Who now could accuse Desnoyers of avarice? . . . He was  investing far more than a fashionable contractor would have dreamed of  spending.    The underlying idea still was to acquire all this for a fourth of its  price--an exciting bait which lured the economical man into continuous  dissipation. He could sleep well only when he had driven a good bargain  during the day. He bought at auction thousands of bottles of wine  consigned by bankrupt firms, and he who scarcely ever drank, packed his  wine cellars to overflowing, advising his family to use the champagne as  freely as ordinary wine. The failure of a furrier induced him to buy for  fourteen thousand francs pelts worth ninety thousand. In consequence,  the entire Desnoyers family seemed suddenly to be suffering as  frightfully from cold as though a polar iceberg had invaded the avenida  Victor Hugo. The father kept only one fur coat for himself but ordered  three for his son. Chichi and Dona Luisa appeared arrayed in all kinds  of silky and luxurious skins--one day chinchilla, other days blue fox,  marten or seal.    The enraptured buyer would permit no one but himself to adorn the  walls with his new acquisitions, using the hammer from the top of a  step-ladder in order to save the expense of a professional picture  hanger. He wished to set his children the example of economy. In his  idle hours, he would change the position of the heaviest pieces of  furniture, trying every kind of combination. This employment reminded  him of those happy days when he handled great sacks of wheat and bundles  of hides on the ranch. Whenever his son noticed that he was looking  thoughtfully at a monumental sideboard or heavy piece, he prudently  betook himself to other haunts.    Desnoyers stood a little in awe of the two house-men, very solemn,  correct creatures always in dress suit, who could not hide their  astonishment at seeing a man with an income of more than a million  francs engaged in such work. Finally it was the two coppery maids  who aided their Patron, the three working contentedly together like  companions in exile.    Four automobiles completed the luxuriousness of the family. The children  would have been more content with one--small and dashing, in the very  latest style. But Desnoyers was not the man to let a bargain slip past  him, so one after the other, he had picked up the four, tempted by the  price. They were as enormous and majestic as coaches of state. Their  entrance into a street made the passers-by turn and stare. The chauffeur  needed two assistants to help him keep this flock of mastodons in order,  but the proud owner thought only of the skill with which he had gotten  the best of the salesmen, anxious to get such monuments out of their  sight.    To his children he was always recommending simplicity and economy. \"We  are not as rich as you suppose. We own a good deal of property, but it  produces a scanty income.\"    And then, after refusing a domestic expenditure of two hundred francs,  he would put five thousand into an unnecessary purchase just because  it would mean a great loss to the seller. Julio and his sister kept  protesting to their mother, Dona Luisa--Chichi even going so far as to  announce that she would never marry a man like her father.    \"Hush, hush!\" exclaimed the scandalized Creole. \"He has his little  peculiarities, but he is very good. Never has he given me any cause for  complaint. I only hope that you may be lucky enough to find his equal.\"    Her husband's quarrelsomeness, his irritable character and his masterful  will all sank into insignificance when she thought of his unvarying  fidelity. In so many years of married life . . . nothing! His  faithfulness had been unexceptional even in the country where many,  surrounded by beasts, and intent on increasing their flocks, had seemed  to become contaminated by the general animalism. She remembered her  father only too well! . . . Even her sister was obliged to live  in apparent calmness with the vainglorious Karl, quite capable of  disloyalty not because of any special lust, but just to imitate the  doings of his superiors.    Desnoyers and his wife were plodding through life in a routine  affection, reminding Dona Luisa, in her limited imagination, of the  yokes of oxen on the ranch who refused to budge whenever another animal  was substituted for the regular companion. Her husband certainly was  quick tempered, holding her responsible for all the whims with which he  exasperated his children, yet he could never bear to have her out of his  sight. The afternoons at the hotel Drouot would be most insipid for him  unless she was at his side, the confidante of his plans and wrathful  outbursts.    \"To-day there is to be a sale of jewels; shall we go?\"    He would make this proposition in such a gentle and coaxing voice--the  voice that Dona Luisa remembered in their first talks around the old  home. And so they would go together, but by different routes;--she in  one of the monumental vehicles because, accustomed to the leisurely  carriage rides of the ranch, she no longer cared to walk; and  Desnoyers--although owner of the four automobiles, heartily abominating  them because he was conservative and uneasy with the complications of  new machinery--on foot under the pretext that, through lack of work, his  body needed the exercise. When they met in the crowded salesrooms, they  proceeded to examine the jewels together, fixing beforehand, the price  they would offer. But he, quick to become exasperated by opposition,  always went further, hurling numbers at his competitors as though they  were blows. After such excursions, the senora would appear as majestic  and dazzling as a basilica of Byzantium--ears and neck decorated  with great pearls, her bosom a constellation of brilliants, her hands  radiating points of light of all colors of the rainbow.    \"Too much, mama,\" Chichi would protest. \"They will take you for a  pawnbroker's lady!\" But the Creole, satisfied with her splendor, the  crowning glory of a humble life, attributed her daughter's faultfinding  to envy. Chichi was only a girl now, but later on she would thank her  for having collected all these gems for her.    Already the home was unable to accommodate so many purchases. In  the cellars were piled up enough paintings, furniture,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#16)"],[1,"a single breath, by the Tarnhelm's magic, back to the hall  of the Gibichungs, leaving the real Gunther to bring Brynhild down  the river after him. One controversialist actually pleaded for the  expedition occupying two nights, on the second of which the alleged  outrage might have taken place. But the time is accounted for to the  last minute: it all takes place during the single night watch of  Hagen. There is no possible way out of the plain fact that Brynhild's  accusation is to her own knowledge false; and the impossible ways just  cited are only interesting as examples of the fanatical worship  which Wagner and his creations have been able to inspire in minds of  exceptional power and culture.    More plausible was the line taken by those who admitted the falsehood.  Their contention was that when Wotan deprived Brynhild of her Godhead,  he also deprived her of her former high moral attributes; so that  Siegfried's kiss awakened an ordinary mortal jealous woman. But a  goddess can become mortal and jealous without plunging at once into  perjury and murder. Besides, this explanation involves the sacrifice of  the whole significance of the allegory, and the reduction of The Ring to  the plane of a child's conception of The Sleeping Beauty. Whoever does  not understand that, in terms of The Ring philosophy, a change from  godhead to humanity is a step higher and not a degradation, misses the  whole point of The Ring. It is precisely because the truthfulness of  Brynhild is proof against Wotan's spells that he has to contrive the  fire palisade with Loki, to protect the fictions and conventions of  Valhalla against her.    The only tolerable view is the one supported by the known history of  The Ring, and also, for musicians of sufficiently fine judgment, by the  evidence of the scores; of which more anon. As a matter of fact Wagner  began, as I have said, with Siegfried's Death. Then, wanting to develop  the idea of Siegfried as neo-Protestant, he went on to The Young  Siegfried. As a Protestant cannot be dramatically projected without a  pontifical antagonist. The Young Siegfried led to The Valkyries, and  that again to its preface The Rhine Gold (the preface is always written  after the book is finished). Finally, of course, the whole was revised.  The revision, if carried out strictly, would have involved the cutting  out of Siegfried's Death, now become inconsistent and superfluous; and  that would have involved, in turn, the facing of the fact that The Ring  was no longer a Niblung epic, and really demanded modern costumes, tall  hats for Tarnhelms, factories for Nibelheims, villas for Valhallas, and  so on--in short, a complete confession of the extent to which the old  Niblung epic had become the merest pretext and name directory in the  course of Wagner's travail. But, as Wagner's most eminent English  interpreter once put it to me at Bayreuth between the acts of Night  Falls On The Gods, the master wanted to \"Lohengrinize\" again after his  long abstention from opera; and Siegfried's Death (first sketched in  1848, the year before the rising in Dresden and the subsequent events  which so deepened Wagner's sense of life and the seriousness of art)  gave him exactly the libretto he required for that outbreak of the  old operatic Adam in him. So he changed it into Die Gotterdammerung,  retaining the traditional plot of murder and jealousy, and with it,  necessarily, his original second act, in spite of the incongruity of its  Siegfried and Brynhild with the Siegfried and Brynhild of the allegory.  As to the legendary matter about the world-ash and the destruction of  Valhalla by Loki, it fitted in well enough; for though, allegorically,  the blow by which Siegfried breaks the god's spear is the end of Wotan  and of Valhalla, those who do not see the allegory, and take the story  literally, like children, are sure to ask what becomes of Wotan after  Siegfried gets past him up the mountain; and to this question the old  tale told in Night Falls On The Gods is as good an answer as another.  The very senselessness of the scenes of the Norns and of Valtrauta in  relation to the three foregoing dramas, gives them a highly effective  air of mystery; and no one ventures to challenge their consequentiality,  because we are all more apt to pretend to understand great works of art  than to confess that the meaning (if any) has escaped us. Valtrauta,  however, betrays her irrelevance by explaining that the gods can  be saved by the restoration of the ring to the Rhine maidens. This,  considered as part of the previous allegory, is nonsense; so that even  this scene, which has a more plausible air of organic connection with  The Valkyries than any other in Night Falls On The Gods, is as clearly  part of a different and earlier conception as the episode which  concludes it, in which Siegfried actually robs Brynhild of her ring,  though he has no recollection of having given it to her. Night Falls On  The Gods, in fact, was not even revised into any real coherence with the  world-poem which sprang from it; and that is the authentic solution of  all the controversies which have arisen over it.    The Third Act    The hunting party comes off duly. Siegfried strays from it and meets  the Rhine maidens, who almost succeed in coaxing the ring from him. He  pretends to be afraid of his wife; and they chaff him as to her beating  him and so forth; but when they add that the ring is accursed and will  bring death upon him, he discloses to them, as unconsciously as Julius  Caesar disclosed it long ago, that secret of heroism, never to let your  life be shaped by fear of its end. [*] So he keeps the ring; and they leave  him to his fate. The hunting party now finds him; and they all sit  down together to make a meal by the river side, Siegfried telling them  meanwhile the story of his adventures. When he approaches the subject of  Brynhild, as to whom his memory is a blank, Hagen pours an antidote  to the love philtre into his drinking horn, whereupon, his memory  returning, he proceeds to narrate the incident of the fiery mountain, to  Gunther's intense mortification. Hagen then plunges his spear into the  back of Siegfried, who falls dead on his shield, but gets up again,  after the old operatic custom, to sing about thirty bars to his love  before allowing himself to be finally carried off to the strains of the  famous Trauermarsch.         * \"We must learn to die, and to die in the fullest sense of       the word. The fear of the end is the source of all       lovelessness; and this fear is generated only when love       begins to wane. How came it that this loves the highest       blessedness to all things living, was so far lost sight of       by the human race that at last it came to this: all that       mankind did, ordered, and established, was conceived only in       fear of the end? My poem sets this forth.\"--Wagner to       Roeckel, 25th Jan. 1854.      The scene then changes to the hall of the Gibichungs by the Rhine. It is  night; and Gutrune, unable to sleep, and haunted by all sorts of vague  terrors, is waiting for the return of her husband, and wondering  whether a ghostly figure she has seen gliding down to the river bank is  Brynhild, whose room is empty. Then comes the cry of Hagen, returning  with the hunting party to announce the death of Siegfried by the tusk of  a wild boar. But Gutrune divines the truth; and Hagen does not deny it.  Siegfried's body is brought in; Gunther claims the ring; Hagen will  not suffer him to take it; they fight; and Gunther is slain. Hagen then  attempts to take it; but the dead man's hand closes on it and raises  itself threateningly. Then Brynhild comes; and a funeral pyre is raised  whilst she declaims a prolonged scene, extremely moving and imposing,  but yielding nothing to resolute intellectual criticism except a very  powerful and elevated exploitation of theatrical pathos, psychologically  identical with the scene of Cleopatra and the dead Antony in  Shakespeare's tragedy. Finally she flings a torch into the pyre, and  rides her war-horse into the flames. The hall of the Gibichungs catches  fire, as most halls would were a cremation attempted in the middle  of the floor (I permit myself this gibe purposely to emphasize the  excessive artificiality of the scene); but the Rhine overflows its  banks to allow the three Rhine maidens to take the ring from Siegfried's  finger, incidentally extinguishing the conflagration as it does so.  Hagen attempts to snatch the ring from the maidens, who promptly drown  him; and in the distant heavens the Gods and their castle are seen  perishing in the fires of Loki as the curtain falls.          FORGOTTEN ERE FINISHED    In all this, it will be observed, there is nothing new. The musical  fabric is enormously elaborate and gorgeous; but you cannot say, as you  must in witnessing The Rhine Gold, The Valkyries, and the first two acts  of Siegfried, that you have never seen anything like it before, and that  the inspiration is entirely original. Not only the action, but most  of the poetry, might conceivably belong to an Elizabethan drama. The  situation of Cleopatra and Antony is unconsciously reproduced without  being bettered, or even equalled in point of majesty and musical  expression. The loss of all simplicity and dignity, the impossibility  of any credible scenic presentation of the incidents, and the extreme  staginess of the conventions by which these impossibilities are got  over, are no doubt covered from the popular eye by the overwhelming  prestige of Die Gotterdammerung as part of so great a work as The Ring,  and by the extraordinary storm of emotion and excitement which the music  keeps up. But the very qualities that intoxicate the novice in music  enlighten the adept. In spite of the fulness of the composer's technical  accomplishment, the finished style and effortless mastery of harmony and  instrumentation"]]]
