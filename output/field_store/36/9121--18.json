Out they hied under the stars, and sought way to the postern whereby  the mummers would come when their work were done. Thereat they  stationed themselves in shadow. A bitter night, with a lather of snow  on the cobbles; but they were heedless of that: love and their dancing  hearts warmed them.    They waited long. Strings of muffled figures began to file out, but  never an one like to Aladdin or the Widow. Midnight tolled. Had these  two had wind of the ambuscado and crept out by another door? Nay,  patience!    At last! A figure showed in the doorway--a figure cloaked womanly, but  topped with face of Aladdin. Trousered Angelica, with a cry, darted  forth from the shadow. To Mistress Vandeleur's eyes she was as truly  man as was Mistress Vandeleur to hers. Thus confronted, Mistress  Vandeleur shrank back, blushing hot.    \"Nay!\" laughs Angelica, clipping her by the wrists. \"Cold boy, you  shall not so easily slip me. A pretty girl you make, Aladdin; but love  pierces such disguise as a rapier might pierce lard.\"    \"Madman! Unhandle me!\" screams the actress.    \"No madman I, as well you know,\" answers Angelica, \"but a maid whom  spurned love may yet madden. Kiss me on the lips!\"    While they struggle, another figure fills the postern, and in an  instant Angelica is torn aside by Master Willie Joffers (well versed,  for all his mumming, in matters of chivalry). \"Kisses for such coward  lips?\" cries he. \"Nay, but a swinge to silence them!\" and would have  struck trousered Angelica full on the mouth. But decollete Geoffrey  Dizzard, crying at him \"Sweet termagant, think not to baffle me by  these airs of manhood!\" had sprung in the way and on his own nose  received the blow.    He staggered and, spurting blood, fell. Up go the buffo's hands,  and \"Now may the Saints whip me,\" cries he, \"for a tapster of  girl's blood!\" and fled into the night, howling like a dog. Mistress  Vandeleur had fled already. Down on her knees goes Angelica, to stanch  Geoffrey's flux.    Thus far, straight history. Apocrypha, all the rest: you shall pick  your own sequel. As for instance, some say Geoffrey bled to the death,  whereby stepped Master Joffers to the scaffold, and Angelica (the  Vandeleur too, like as not) to a nunnery. Others have it he lived,  thanks to nurse Angelica, who, thereon wed, suckled him twin Dizzards  in due season. Joffers, they say, had wife already, else would have  wed the Vandeleur, for sake of symmetry.          DICKENS    _By_    G**RGE M**RE      I had often wondered why when people talked to me of Tintoretto I  always found myself thinking of Turgeneff. It seemed to me strange  that I should think of Turgeneff instead of thinking of Tintoretto;  for at first sight nothing can be more far apart than the Slav mind  and the Flemish. But one morning, some years ago, while I was musing  by my fireplace in Victoria Street, Dolmetsch came to see me. He had  a soiled roll of music under his left arm. I said, \"How are you?\" He  said, \"I am well. And you?\" I said, \"I, too, am well. What is that, my  dear Dolmetsch, that you carry under your left arm?\" He answered, \"It  is a Mass by Palestrina.\" \"Will you read me the score?\" I asked. I was  afraid he would say no. But Dolmetsch is not one of those men who say  no, and he read me the score. He did not read very well, but I had  never heard it before, so when he finished I begged of him he would  read it to me again. He said, \"Very well, M**re, I will read it to you  again.\" I remember his exact words, because they seemed to me at the  time to be the sort of thing that only Dolmetsch could have said. It  was a foggy morning in Victoria Street, and while Dolmetsch read again  the first few bars, I thought how Renoir would have loved to paint  in such an atmosphere the tops of the plane trees that flaccidly show  above the wall of Buckingham Palace.... Why had I never been invited  to Buckingham Palace? I did not want to go there, but it would have  been nice to have been asked.... How _brave gaillard_ was Renoir, and  how well he painted from that subfusc palette!...    My roving thoughts were caught back to the divine score which  Arnold Dolmetsch was reading to me. How well placed they were, those  semibreves! Could anyone but Palestrina have placed them so nicely? I  wondered what girl Palestrina was courting when he conceived them. She  must have been blonde, surely, and with narrow flanks.... There are  moments when one does not think of girls, are there not, dear reader?  And I swear to you that such a moment came to me while Dolmetsch  mumbled the last two bars of that Mass. The notes were \"do, la, sol,  do, fa, do, sol, la,\" and as he mumbled them I sat upright and stared  into space, for it had become suddenly plain to me why when people  talked of Tintoretto I always found myself thinking of Turgeneff.    I do not say that this story that I have told to you is a very good  story, and I am afraid that I have not well told it. Some day, when  I have time, I should like to re-write it. But meantime I let it  stand, because without it you could not receive what is upmost in my  thoughts, and which I wish you to share with me. Without it, what I  am yearning to say might seem to you a hard saying; but now you will  understand me.    There never was a writer except Dickens. Perhaps you have never heard  say of him? No matter, till a few days past he was only a name to me.  I remember that when I was a young man in Paris, I read a praise of  him in some journal; but in those days I was kneeling at other altars,  I was scrubbing other doorsteps.... So has it been ever since; always  a false god, always the wrong doorstep. I am sick of the smell of the  incense I have swung to this and that false god--Zola, Yeats, _et tous  ces autres_. I am angry to have got housemaid's knee, because I got  it on doorsteps that led to nowhere. There is but one doorstep worth  scrubbing. The doorstep of Charles Dickens....    Did he write many books? I know not, it does not greatly matter, he  wrote the \"Pickwick Papers\"; that suffices. I have read as yet but  one chapter, describing a Christmas party in a country house. Strange  that anyone should have essayed to write about anything but that!  Christmas--I see it now--is the only moment in which men and women are  really alive, are really worth writing about. At other seasons they  do not exist for the purpose of art. I spit on all seasons except  Christmas.... Is he not in all fiction the greatest figure, this Mr.  Wardell, this old \"squire\" rosy-cheeked, who entertains this Christmas  party at his house? He is more truthful, he is more significant, than  any figure in Balzac. He is better than all Balzac's figures rolled  into one.... I used to kneel on that doorstep. Balzac wrote many  books. But now it behoves me to ask myself whether he ever wrote a  good book. One knows that he used to write for fifteen hours at a  stretch, gulping down coffee all the while. But it does not follow  that the coffee was good, nor does it follow that what he wrote was  good. The Comedie Humaine is all chicory.... I had wished for some  years to say this, I am glad _d'avoir debarrasse ma poitrine de ca_.    To have described divinely a Christmas party is something, but it is  not everything. The disengaging of the erotic motive is everything, is  the only touchstone. If while that is being done we are soothed into  a trance, a nebulous delirium of the nerves, then we know the novelist  to be a supreme novelist. If we retain consciousness, he is not  supreme, and to be less than supreme in art is to not exist....  Dickens disengages the erotic motive through two figures, Mr. Winkle,  a sportman, and Miss Arabella, \"a young lady with fur-topped boots.\"  They go skating, he helps her over a stile. Can one not well see  her? She steps over the stile and her shin defines itself through her  balbriggan stocking. She is a knock-kneed girl, and she looks at Mr.  Winkle with that sensual regard that sometimes comes when the wind  is north-west. Yes, it is a north-west wind that is blowing over this  landscape that Hals or Winchoven might have painted--no, Winchoven  would have fumbled it with rose-madder, but Hals would have done it  well. Hals would have approved--would he not?--the pollard aspens,  these pollard aspens deciduous and wistful, which the rime makes  glistening. That field, how well ploughed it is, and are they not like  petticoats, those clouds low-hanging? Yes, Hals would have stated them  well, but only Manet could have stated the slope of the thighs of  the girl--how does she call herself?--Arabella--it is a so hard name  to remember--as she steps across the stile. Manet would have found  pleasure in her cheeks also. They are a little chapped with the  north-west wind that makes the pollard aspens to quiver. How adorable  a thing it is, a girl's nose that the north-west wind renders red! We  may tire of it sometimes, because we sometimes tire of all things,  but Winkle does not know this. Is Arabella his mistress? If she is  not, she has been, or at any rate she will be. How full she is of  temperament, is she not? Her shoulder-blades seem a little carelessly  modelled, but how good they are in intention! How well placed that  smut on her left cheek!    Strange thoughts of her surge up vaguely in me as I watch  her--thoughts that I cannot express in English.... Elle est plus  vieille que les roches entre lesquelles elle s'est assise; comme  le vampire elle a ete frequemment morte, et a appris les secrets du  tombeau; et s'est plongee dans des mers profondes, et conserve autour  d'elle leur jour ruine; et, comme Lede, etait mere d'Helene de Troie,  et, comme Sainte-Anne, mere de Maria; et tout cela n'a ete pour elle  que.... I desist, for not through French can be expressed the thoughts  that surge in me. French is a stale language. So are all the European  languages, one can say in them nothing fresh...."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14672"],[0,"The Religion of the Ancient Celts (#16)"],[1,"called _Be find_, \"White Women,\" like  fairies who represent the _Matres_ elsewhere, and that they freely offer  their love to mortals, may connect them with this group of goddesses.  Again, when the Milesians arrived in Ireland, three kings of the Tuatha  Dea had wives called Eriu, Banba, and Fotla, who begged that Ireland  should be called after them. This was granted, but only Eriu (Erin)  remained in general use.[247] The story is an aetiological myth  explaining the names of Ireland, but the three wives may be a group like  the _Matres_, guardians of the land which took its name from them.    Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba, who give a title to the whole group, are  called _tri dee Donand_, \"the three gods (sons of) Danu,\" or, again,  \"gods of _dan_\" (knowledge), perhaps as the result of a folk-etymology,  associating _dan_ with their mother's name Danu.[248] Various attributes  are personified as their descendants, Wisdom being son of all  three.[249] Though some of these attributes may have been actual gods,  especially Ecne or Wisdom, yet it is more probable that the  personification is the result of the subtleties of bardic science, of  which similar examples occur.[250] On the other hand, the fact that Ecne  is the son of three brothers, may recall some early practice of  polyandry of which instances are met with in the sagas.[251] M. D'Arbois  has suggested that Iuchar and Iucharba are mere duplicates of Brian, who  usually takes the leading place, and he identifies them with three kings  of the Tuatha Dea reigning at the time of the Milesian invasion--  MacCuill, MacCecht, and MacGrainne, so called, according to Keating,  because the hazel (_coll_), the plough (_cecht_), and the sun (_grian_)  were \"gods of worship\" to them. Both groups are grandsons of Dagda, and  M. D'Arbois regards this second group as also triplicates of one god,  because their wives Fotla, Banba, and Eriu all bear names of Ireland  itself, are personifications of the land, and thus may be \"reduced to  unity.\"[252] While this reasoning is ingenious, it should be remembered  that we must not lay too much stress upon Irish divine genealogies,  while each group of three may have been similar local gods associated at  a later time as brothers. Their separate personality is suggested by the  fact that the Tuatha De Danann are called after them \"the Men of the  Three Gods,\" and their supremacy appears in the incident of Dagda, Lug,  and Ogma consulting them before the fight at Mag-tured--a natural  proceeding if they were gods of knowledge or destiny.[253] The brothers  are said to have slain the god Cian, and to have been themselves slain  by Lug, and on this seems to have been based the story of _The Children  of Tuirenn_, in which they perish through their exertions in obtaining  the _eric_ demanded by Lug.[254] Here they are sons of Tuirenn, but more  usually their mother Danu or Brigit is mentioned.    Another son of Brigit's was Ogma, master of poetry and inventor of  _ogham_ writing, the word being derived from his name.[255] It is more  probable that Ogma's name is a derivative from some word signifying  \"speech\" or \"writing,\" and that the connection with \"ogham\" may be a  mere folk-etymology. Ogma appears as the champion of the gods,[256] a  position given him perhaps from the primitive custom of rousing the  warriors' emotions by eloquent speeches before a battle. Similarly the  Babylonian Marduk, \"seer of the gods,\" was also their champion in fight.  Ogma fought and died at Mag-tured; but in other accounts he survives,  captures Tethra's sword, goes on the quest for Dagda's harp, and is  given a _sid_ after the Milesian victory. Ogma's counterpart in Gaul is  Ogmios, a Herakles and a god of eloquence, thus bearing the dual  character of Ogma, while Ogma's epithet _grianainech_, \"of the smiling  countenance,\" recalls Lucian's account of the \"smiling face\" of  Ogmios.[257] Ogma's high position is the result of the admiration of  bardic eloquence among the Celts, whose loquacity was proverbial, and to  him its origin was doubtless ascribed, as well as that of poetry. The  genealogists explain his relationship to the other divinities in  different ways, but these confusions may result from the fact that gods  had more than one name, of which the annalists made separate  personalities. Most usually Ogma is called Brigit's son. Her functions  were like his own, but in spite of the increasing supremacy of gods over  goddesses, he never really eclipsed her.    Among other culture gods were those associated with the arts and  crafts--the development of Celtic art in metal-work necessitating the  existence of gods of this art. Such a god is Goibniu, eponymous god of  smiths (Old Ir. _goba_, \"smith\"), and the divine craftsman at the battle  of Mag-tured, making spears which never failed to kill.[258] Smiths have  everywhere been regarded as uncanny--a tradition surviving from the  first introduction of metal among those hitherto accustomed to stone  weapons and tools. S. Patrick prayed against the \"spells of women,  smiths, and Druids,\" and it is thus not surprising to find that Goibniu  had a reputation for magic, even among Christians. A spell for making  butter, in an eighth century MS. preserved at S. Gall, appeals to his  \"science.\"[259] Curiously enough, Goibniu is also connected with the  culinary art in myth, and, like Hephaistos, prepares the feast of the  gods, while his ale preserves their immortality.[260] The elation  produced by heady liquors caused them to be regarded as draughts of  immortality, like Soma, Haoma, or nectar. Goibniu survives in tradition  as the _Gobhan Saer_, to whom the building of round towers is ascribed.    Another god of crafts was Creidne the brazier (Ir. _cerd_, \"artificer\";  cf. Scots _caird_, \"tinker\"), who assisted in making a silver hand for  Nuada, and supplied with magical rapidity parts of the weapons used at  Mag-tured.[261] According to the annalists, he was drowned while  bringing golden ore from Spain.[262] Luchtine, god of carpenters,  provided spear-handles for the battle, and with marvellous skill flung  them into the sockets of the spear-heads.[263]    Diancecht, whose name may mean \"swift in power,\" was god of medicine,  and, with Creidne's help, fashioned a silver hand for Nuada.[264] His  son Miach replaced this by a magic restoration of the real hand, and in  jealousy his father slew him--a version of the _Maerchen_ formula of the  jealous master. Three hundred and sixty-five herbs grew from his grave,  and were arranged according to their properties by his sister Airmed,  but Diancecht again confused them, \"so that no one knows their proper  cures.\"[265] At the second battle of Mag-tured, Diancecht presided over  a healing-well containing magic herbs. These and the power of spells  caused the mortally wounded who were placed in it to recover. Hence it  was called \"the spring of health.\"[266] Diancecht, associated with a  healing-well, may be cognate with Grannos. He is also referred to in the  S. Gall MS., where his healing powers are extolled.    An early chief of the gods is Dagda, who, in the story of the battle of  Mag-tured, is said to be so called because he promised to do more than  all the other gods together. Hence they said, \"It is thou art the _good  hand_\" (_dag-dae_). The _Coir Anmann_ explains _Dagda_ as \"fire of god\"  (_daig_ and _dea_). The true derivation is from _dagos_, \"good,\" and  _deivos_, \"god,\" though Dr. Stokes considers _Dagda_ as connected with  _dagh_, whence _daghda_, \"cunning.\"[267] Dagda is also called Cera, a  word perhaps derived from _kar_ and connected with Lat. _cerus_,  \"creator\" and other names of his are _Ruad-rofhessa_, \"lord of great  knowledge,\" and _Eochaid Ollathair_, \"great father,\" \"for a great father  to the Tuatha De Danann was he.\"[268] He is also called \"a beautiful  god,\" and \"the principal god of the pagans.\"[269] After the battle he  divides the _brugs_ or _sid_ among the gods, but his son Oengus, having  been omitted, by a stratagem succeeded in ousting his father from  his _sid_, over which he now himself reigned[270]--possibly the survival  of an old myth telling of a superseding of Dagda's cult by that of  Oengus, a common enough occurrence in all religions. In another version,  Dagda being dead, Bodb Dearg divides the _sid_, and Manannan makes the  Tuatha Dea invisible and immortal. He also helps Oengus to drive out his  foster-father Elemar from his _brug_, where Oengus now lives as a  god.[271] The underground _brugs_ are the gods' land, in all respects  resembling the oversea Elysium, and at once burial-places of the  euhemerised gods and local forms of the divine land. Professor Rh[^y]s  regards Dagda as an atmospheric god; Dr. MacBain sees in him a sky-god.  More probably he is an early Earth-god and a god of agriculture. He has  power over corn and milk, and agrees to prevent the other gods from  destroying these after their defeat by the Milesians--former beneficent  gods being regarded as hurtful, a not uncommon result of the triumph of  a new faith.[272] Dagda is called \"the god of the earth\" \"because of the  greatness of his power.\"[273] Mythical objects associated with him  suggest plenty and fertility--his cauldron which satisfied all comers,  his unfailing swine, one always living, the other ready for cooking, a  vessel of ale, and three trees always laden with fruit. These were in  his _sid_, where none ever tasted death;[274] hence his _sid_ was a  local Elysium, not a gloomy land of death, but the underworld in its  primitive aspect as the place of gods of fertility. In some myths he  appears with a huge club or fork, and M. D'Arbois suggests that he may  thus be an equivalent of the Gaulish god with the mallet.[275] This is  probable, since the Gaulish god may have been a form of Dispater, an  Earth or under-Earth god of fertility.    If Dagda was a god of fertility, he may have been an equivalent"]]]
