In these  days, indeed, the purchase of them was deemed favourable to both parties,  for there was little or no knowledge of the manner in which they had been  procured as slaves. There was no charge of inconsistency on this account,  as in later times. But though many of the Quakers engaged, without their  usual consideration, in purchases of this kind, yet those constitutional  principles, which belong to the Society, occasioned the members of it in  general to treat those whom they purchased with great tenderness,  considering them, though of a different colour, as brethren, and as persons  for whose spiritual welfare it became them to be concerned; so that  slavery, except as to the power legally belonging to it, was in general  little more than servitude in their hands.    This treatment, as it was thus mild on the continent of America where the  members of this Society were the owners of slaves, so it was equally mild  in the West India islands where they had a similar property. In the latter  countries, however, where only a few of them lived, it began soon to be  productive of serious consequences; for it was so different from that,  which the rest of the inhabitants considered to be proper, that the latter  became alarmed at it. Hence in Barbadoes an act was passed in 1676, under  Governor Atkins, which was entitled, An Act to prevent the people called  Quakers from bringing their Negros into their meetings for worship, though  they held these in their own houses. This act was founded on the pretence,  that the safety of the island might be endangered, if the slaves were to  imbibe the religious principles of their masters. Under this act Ralph  Fretwell and Richard Sutton were fined in the different sums of eight  hundred and of three hundred pounds, because each of them had suffered a  meeting of the Quakers at his own house, at the first of which eighty  Negros, and at the second of which thirty of them, were present. But this  matter was carried still further; for in 1680, Sir Richard Dutton, then  governor of the island, issued an order to the Deputy Provost Marshal and  others, to prohibit all meetings of this Society. In the island of Nevis  the same bad spirit manifested itself.--So early as in 1661, a law was made  there prohibiting members of this Society from coming on shore. Negros were  put in irons for being present at their meetings, and they themselves were  fined also. At length, in 1677, another act was passed, laying a heavy  penalty on every master of a vessel, who should even bring a Quaker to the  island. In Antigua and Bermudas similar proceedings took place, so that the  Quakers were in time expelled from this part of the world. By these means a  valuable body of men were lost to the community in these islands, whose  example might have been highly useful; and the poor slave, who saw nothing  but misery in his temporal prospects, was deprived of the only balm, which  could have soothed his sorrow--the comfort of religion.    But to return to the continent of America.--Though the treatment, which the  Quakers adopted there towards those Africans who fell into their hands, was  so highly commendable, it did not prevent individuals among them from  becoming uneasy about holding them in slavery at all. Some of these bore  their private testimony against it from the beginning as a wrong practice,  and in process of time brought it before the notice of their brethren as a  religious body. So early as in the year 1688, some emigrants from Krieshiem  in Germany, who had adopted the principles of William Penn, and followed  him into Pennsylvania, urged in the yearly meeting of the Society there,  the inconsistency of buying, selling, and holding men in slavery, with the  principles of the Christian religion.    In the year 1696, the yearly meeting for that province took up the subject  as a public concern, and the result was, advice to the members of it to  guard against future importations of African slaves, and to be particularly  attentive to the treatment of those, who were then in their possession.    In the year 1711, the same yearly meeting resumed the important subject,  and confirmed and renewed the advice, which had been before given.    From this time it continued to keep the subject alive; but finding at  length, that, though individuals refused to purchase slaves, yet others  continued the custom, and in greater numbers than it was apprehended would  have been the case after the public declarations which had been made, it  determined, in the year 1754, upon a fuller and more serious publication of  its sentiments; and therefore it issued, in the same year, the following  pertinent letter to all the members within its jurisdiction:--    \"Dear Friends,    \"It hath frequently been the concern of our yearly meeting to testify their  uneasiness and disunity with the importation and purchasing of Negros and  other slaves, and to direct the overseers of the several meetings to advise  and deal with such as engage therein. And it hath likewise been the  continual care of many weighty Friends to press those, who bear our name,  to guard, as much as possible, against being in any respect concerned in  promoting the bondage of such unhappy people. Yet, as we have with sorrow  to observe, that their number is of late increased among us, we have  thought it proper to make our advice and judgment more public, that none  may plead ignorance of our principles therein; and also again earnestly to  exhort all to avoid, in any manner, encouraging that practice, of making  slaves of our fellow-creatures.    \"Now, dear Friends, if we continually bear in mind the royal law of doing  to others as we would be done by, we should never think of bereaving our  fellow-creatures of that valuable blessing--liberty, nor endure to grow  rich by their bondage. To live in ease and plenty by the toil of those,  whom violence and cruelty have put in our power, is neither consistent with  Christianity nor common justice; and, we have good reason to believe, draws  down the displeasure of Heaven; it being a melancholy but true reflection,  that, where slave-keeping prevails, pure religion and sobriety decline, as  it evidently tends to harden the heart, and render the soul less  susceptible of that holy spirit of love, meekness, and charity, which is  the peculiar characteristic of a true Christian.    \"How then can we, who have been concerned to publish the Gospel of  universal love and peace among mankind, be so inconsistent with ourselves,  as to purchase such as are prisoners of war, and thereby encourage this  antichristian practice; and more especially as many of these poor creatures  are stolen away, parents from children, and children from parents; and  others, who were in good circumstances in their native country, inhumanly  torn from what they esteemed a happy situation, and compelled to toil in a  state of slavery, too often extremely cruel! What dreadful scenes of murder  and cruelty those barbarous ravages must occasion in these unhappy people's  country are too obvious to mention. Let us make their case our own, and  consider what we should think, and how we should feel, were we in their  circumstances. Remember our Blessed Redeemer's positive command--to do unto  others as we would have them do unto us;--and that with what measure we  mete, it shall be measured to us again. And we intreat you to examine,  whether the purchasing of a Negro, either born here or imported, doth not  contribute to a further importation, and, consequently, to the upholding of  all the evils above mentioned, and to the promoting of man-stealing, the  only theft which by the Mosaic law was punished with death;--'He that  stealeth a man, and selleth him; or if he be found in his hand, he shall  surely be put to death.'    \"The characteristic and badge of a true Christian is love and good works.  Our Saviour's whole life on earth was one continual exercise of them. 'Love  one another,' says he, 'as I have loved you.' But how can we be said to  love our brethren, who bring, or, for selfish ends, keep them, in bondage?  Do we act consistently with this noble principle, who lay such heavy  burthens on our fellow-creatures? Do we consider that they are called, and  do we sincerely desire that they may become heirs with us in glory, and  that they may rejoice in the liberty of the sons of God, whilst we are  withholding from them the common liberties of mankind? Or can the Spirit of  God, by which we have always professed to be led, be the author of those  oppressive and unrighteous measures? Or do we not thereby manifest, that  temporal interest hath more influence on our conduct herein, than the  dictates of that merciful, holy, and unerring Guide?    \"And we likewise earnestly recommend to all, who have slaves, to be careful  to come up in the performance of their duty towards them, and to be  particularly watchful over their own hearts, it being by sorrowful  experience remarkable, that custom, and a familiarity with evil of any  kind, have a tendency to bias the judgement and to deprave the mind. And it  is obvious that the future welfare of these poor slaves, who are now in  bondage, is generally too much disregarded by those who keep them. If their  daily task of labour be but fulfilled, little else perhaps is thought of.  Nay, even that which in others would be looked upon with horror and  detestation, is little regarded in them by their masters,--such as the  frequent separation of husbands from wives and wives from husbands, whereby  they are tempted to break their marriage covenants, and live in adultery,  in direct opposition to the laws of God and men, although we believe that  Christ died for all men without respect of persons.

Thus the different groups of Hebrew narratives in their  characteristic way record the essential facts in Moses' call to  public service.  Each has preserved certain important elements in  that call, and the late editor has done well to combine them.  Even  as Isaiah caught his supreme vision of Jehovah and of duty in the  temple, so to Moses the prophetic call probably came on the lofty  heights of the mountain in which he, in common with the Kenites,  believed God dwelt.  The wilderness with its flaming bush spoke to  him God's message.  Recent writers have felt and forcibly  interpreted the fascination and the message of the desert and  plain, none more vividly than the Welsh writer Rhoscomyl in  describing the experience of one of his rough, self-reliant cowboy  heroes:    \"Two days ago he was riding back, alone, in the afternoon, from an  unsuccessful search after strayed horses, and suddenly, all in the  lifting of a hoof, the weird prairie had gleamed into eerie life,  had dropped the veil and spoken to him; while the breeze stopped,  and the sun stood still for a flash in waiting for his answer.  And  he, his heart in a grip of ice, the frozen flesh a-crawl with  terror upon his loosened bones, white-lipped and wide-eyed with  frantic fear, uttered a yell of horror as he dashed the spurs into  his panic-stricken horse, in a mad endeavor to escape from the  Awful Presence that filled all earth and sky from edge to edge of  vision.    \"Then almost in the same flash, the unearthly light died out of the  dim prairie, the veil swept across into place again; and he managed  to check his wild flight, and look about him.  His empty lips were  gibbering without a sound escaping them, and his very heart  shivered with cold, for all the brassy heat of the day.  But the  breeze was wandering on again; under the great sun the prairie  spread dim to the southwest, and tawny to the northeast; only  between his own loose knees the horse trembled in every limb, and  mumbled the bit with dry mouth.  All was as before in earth and  sky, apparently, but not in his own self.  It was as if his spirit  stood apart from him, putting questions which he could not answer,  and demanding judgment upon problems which he dare not reason out.    \"Then he remembered what this thing was which had happened.  The  prairie had spoken to him, as sooner or later it spoke to most men  that rode it.  It was a something well known amongst them, but  known without words, and as by a subtle instinct, for no man who  had experienced it ever spoke willingly about it afterwards.  Only  the man would be changed; some began to be more reckless, as if a  dumb blasphemy rankled hidden in their breasts.  Others, coming  with greater strength perhaps to the ordeal, became quieter,  looking squarely at any danger as they face it, but continuing  ahead as though quietly confident that nothing happened save as the  gods ordained.\"    The motive power in all of Moses' later work was that transforming,  vivid sense of Jehovah's presence that came to him on the barren  mountain peak.    Also fundamental to his call was the recognition of the crying need  of his disorganized, oppressed kinsmen in Egypt.  This appealed to  all the instincts begotten by his shepherd training; for they were  a shepherdless flock in the midst of wolves.  Through the ages the  inhabitants of the parched, stony wilderness had looked with hungry  eyes upon the tree-clad hills and green fields of Palestine.  The  early traditions of his ancestors also glorified this paradise of  the wilderness wanderer and led Moses to look to it as the haven of  refuge to which he might lead his helpless kinsmen.  Vividly and  concretely the ancient narrative tells of the struggle in the mind  of Moses between his own diffidence and consciousness of his  limitations on the one side and on the other his sense of duty and  the realization of Jehovah's power to accomplish what seemed to man  miraculous.  Was Moses' inner experience like that of the other  great Hebrew prophets?  Who?  Like that of Jesus?  Does every man  who undertakes a great service for humanity to-day pass through a  somewhat similar struggle?  How about Grant on leaving his home at  Galena, Illinois?  Lincoln at the great crisis of his life?      V.    THE EDUCATION OF PUBLIC OPINION.    Like every man who catches a vision of a great need and undertakes  to meet it, Moses had to educate public opinion.  Whatever the form  of government may be, whether monarchy or democracy, it must  ultimately rest upon the will of the people, and the shaping of  that will is often a statesman's task.  In a democracy the  expression of the people's will is readily determined at every  election, although in many cases, owing to the number of issues,  this result is not clearly seen.    In a despotism like Egypt there is no ready expression of a  people's will.  However great their sufferings, they must endure  until they feel that the evils of revolt are less than the evils of  oppression.  Then, by means of a revolution, they carry out their  will.  In what ways did the Exodus resemble, in what ways differ  from a revolution?  Compare Moses with Washington or Samuel Adams  as leader of a revolution.  During the last few years in China  there has been great dissatisfaction on the part of many millions  of the people with the rule of the Manchu dynasty.  It was,  nevertheless, for many years the people's will rather to endure the  evils of a corrupt government than to take the risk of war.  At  length, however, after years of propaganda by skilful leaders war  appeared to them the lesser evil and their will was carried out by  force of arms.  The government, in this direct way, was forced to  recognize the will of the people and to grant their requests.    A statesman considers not merely his own views regarding the best  methods of governing his country or of gaining special ends, but he  must carefully consider also what plans can in practice be carried  out.  In all free governments only those policies can be put into  effect that meet the approval of the people; and one of the  greatest gifts of a statesman is the ability to ascertain, with few  mistakes, how far his proposed policies meet the public will and  how he can so put his plans before the people as to convince them  of their benefits.    In the later days of the Egyptian bondage the Israelites made  frequent complaint of the oppression of the Pharaohs, bemoaning  their fate as serfs, but for many years after their sufferings had  become severe they had not yet been roused to a determination to  throw off the yoke of the oppressor.  Even when Moses first  attempted to rouse them to make a struggle for freedom, he could  not breathe into them his own bold spirit.  What measures did Moses  take to incite the Israelites to action?  What measures did he take  to convince Pharaoh of his duty toward the Israelites?  Did he  present his case truthfully?  Was he justified in the measures  taken?    At length, not from the acts of the Israelites, but from the  plagues that afflicted the Egyptians and the insistent demand of  Moses, coupled with the belief that the plagues were sent on  account of divine displeasure, as a punishment for unjust  oppression, the Hebrews were enabled to escape.  What is the  contemporary Egyptian testimony regarding the plagues?  (_Hist.  Bible_ I, 176-7.)  Do the earliest Hebrew records imply that these  were miracles or natural calamities peculiar to the land of Egypt?  The statesmanship of Moses led him to seize the opportune time for  freeing his people from bondage.  Only the influence of the  religious sentiments among his people and their belief in Jehovah  together with the religious awe felt by the Egyptian rulers,  enabled him to take advantage of the circumstances so that he could  rescue his people.  In most countries religion is a powerful  influence often made use of by rulers, sometimes for good,  sometimes for ill, to direct the action of their subjects.  The  Greek church in Russia has for many decades been, perhaps, the most  important weapon by which the Russian Czars have kept their people  in peaceful submission.  If China loses her Mongolian provinces, it  will be because the religious leaders of Mongolia are controlling  their people.  Can you give in the United States an example of a  people largely dominated by the religious motive which controls  most of the affairs of their every-day life?  How far was the  religious motive responsible for the settlement and upbuilding of  the New England Colonies?  How far and in what ways may a statesman  to-day appeal to the moral and religious feelings of the people in  order to promote national and international welfare?      VI.    THE TRAINING OF MODERN STATESMEN.    In training administrative officers in the leading countries of  Europe and in the United States, emphasis is laid upon a knowledge  of history, of constitutional, administrative and international  law, politics, economics, diplomacy and any other subjects that may  fall within the scope of action of the special official.  When,  however, a law-maker or a high administrative official deals at  first hand with a great population, it is extremely important that  he be so experienced and so fitted by temperament that he may know  his people.  He must see how far he can go without arousing too  much opposition.  Even in promoting good measures, it is often  essential not to go too fast, if he is to succeed.    Every statesman of modern times, as well as those of bygone days,  must have the interests of the people genuinely at heart if he is  to be, in the best sense of the word, successful.  What did Moses  seek for his people?  Liberty?  Prosperity?  Religious freedom?    Confucius, the great Chinese sage, from his study of human nature  and of government five centuries before Christ, had learned that  the rule of justice in the"]]]
