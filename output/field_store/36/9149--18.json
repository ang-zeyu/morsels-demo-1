It is extremely unlikely that Christian bishops and priests should have  had recourse to such treatment of their coreligionists: yet they had a  spiritual weapon ready to their hands, and they were not slow to use it.  They anathematised[3] those who aided and abetted the zealots; and  Eulogius himself seems to have narrowly escaped their sentence of  excommunication.[4]        [1] _Ibid._, sec. 15--\"Ne ad martyrii surgerent palmam,      iuramentum extorsimus ... et maledictum ne maledictionibus      impeterent, evangelio et cruce educta, vi iurare improbiter      fecimus.\"        [2] _Ibid._, cp. Alvar, \"Life of Eulog.,\" iv. sec. 12--\"Duris      tormentis agitati, commoti sunt.\"        [3] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.\" i. sec. 28--\"Ne ceteri ad huiusmodi      palaestram discurrant schedulis anathematum per loca varia      damnari iubentur.\" Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 31--\"Plerosque      patres anathematizantes talia patientes.\"        [4] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" iii. c. iv. sec. 5.    This action against the zealots was in all probability taken, if not at  the instigation of the Moslem authorities, yet in close concert with  them. Eulogius[1] attributes all the evils which had befallen the  Church, such as the imprisonment of bishops, priests, abbots, and  deacons, to the wrath of the King; and Alvar distinctly states that the  King was urged, even bribed, to take measures against the Christians.[2]  It is not likely that the King required much persuading. Mohammed at  least seems to have been thoroughly frightened by the continued  agitation against Mohammedanism. He naturally suspected some political  plot at the bottom of it; a supposition which receives some countenance  from the various references in Eulogius[3] to the martyrs as \"Soldiers  of God\" bound to war against His Moslem enemies; and from the undoubted  fact that the Christians of Toledo did rise in favour of their  coreligionists at Cordova.[4] However that may be, the King in 852  certainly took counsel[5] with his ministers, how the agitation should  be met, and he seems to have assembled a sort of grand council[6] of  the Church, when the same question was discussed. Stronger measures were  in consequence taken, and a more rigorous imprisonment resorted to. But  Mohammed went farther than this. He deprived of their posts all  Christians, who held offices in the palace,[7] or in connection with the  Court, and withdrew from the Christian \"cadet corps,\"[8] the royal  bounty usually extended to them. He ordered the destruction of all  churches built since the conquest, and of all later additions to those  previously existing. He made a severe enactment against those who  reviled Mohammed.[9] He even had in mind to banish all Christians from  his dominions.[10] This intention, together with the order respecting  the churches, was not carried out, owing probably to the opportune  revolt at Toledo.[11]        [1] Ep. ad Wilies, sec. 10.        [2] Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 35.        [3] See Dozy, ii. 136.        [4] Conde, i. 249: Dozy, ii. 161, says on Eulogius' authority,      that he incited them to revolt under Sindila.        [5] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. c. xiv.        [6] Robertson calls it a Conciliabulum.        [7] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. Sec. 2.        [8] \"Militares pueros.\" Eulog. \"Mem. Sanct.,\" iii. c. i.        [9] Eulog. \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. c. xiv--\"Tunc iam procul dubio      enecandi nos difficultas fuit adempta, si quisquam vatis sui      temerarius exprobator ultro occurreret.\" This seems to mean      that Christians and Saracens were bound to give up to justice      any who reviled the Prophet; or else to kill him on the spot.        [10] Eulog., \"Doc. Mart.,\" sec. 18--\"Moslemi ... omne regni      sui, sicuti cernitis, genus excludere moliuntur      Christicolarum.\"        [11] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" iii. c. iv.    In one of his works on this subject, Eulogius expresses a fear lest the  intervention of the martyrs should bring disaster on the Church in  Spain, just as the intervention of Moses in Egypt did much at first to  aggravate the hardships of the Israelites.[1] He ought not, therefore,  to have been surprised, when such a result actually did follow; nor  ought he to complain that now the Moslems would only let the Christians  observe their religion in such a way as they chose to dictate; and that  the Christians were subjected to all sorts of taxes and exactions.[2]    These combined measures of repression, taken by the King and the Bishop  of Seville, soon produced their effect. The extreme party were broken  up, some escaping to quieter regions, others hiding, and only venturing  abroad in disguise and at night--not, as Eulogius is careful to add,  from fear of death, but because the high prize of martyrdom is not  reserved for the unworthy many, but for the worthy few.[3]        [1] _Ibid._, ii. c. xvi.        [2] Eulog., \"Doc. Mart.,\" sec. 18--\"_Nunc_ pro suo libito      tantummodo exercere nos sinentes Christianismum ... _nunc_      publicum imponentes censum, _nunc_ rebus nos abdicantes      detrimentis atterunt rerum.\"        [3] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. sec. 14--\"Quia indigni sumus      martyrio, quod quibusdam et non omnibus datum est.\"    Some even apostatized,[1] while many of those who had applauded the  proceedings of the martyrs, now called them indiscreet, and blamed them  for indulging in a selfish desire to desert the suffering Church for an  early mansion in the skies.[2] Others, in order to retain posts under  Government, or to court favour with the King, dissembled their religion,  taking care not to pray, or make the sign of the cross in public.[3]  Eulogius himself was singled out at the meeting of the King's Council by  one of the royal secretaries, Gomez, son of Antonian, son of Julian,[4]  as the ringleader of the new seditious movement. This man was a very  worldly-minded Christian,[5] and was, no doubt, at this time, in fear of  losing his lucrative office at Court, which he had obtained by his  remarkable knowledge of Arabic. He did, in fact, lose his post with all  the other Christian officers of the Court, but regained it by becoming a  Moslem;[6] and such was the ardour of the new proselyte that he was  called \"the dove of the mosque.\"[7]    The result of this council was, as we have seen, hostile to the party of  which Eulogius and Saul were the chiefs, but the former writer,  mentioning the actual decree that was passed, pretends that it was  merely a blind to deceive the king, and spoken figuratively; and he  acknowledges that such hypocrisy was unworthy of the prelates and  officers assembled.[8] Is it not more reasonable to suppose that  Eulogius and his supporters voted for it--as they seem to have  done--with a mental reservation, while their opponents honestly  considered such a step necessary?        [1] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. c. xv. 1--\"Fidem praevaricantur,      abdicant religionem, Crucifixum detestantur.\"        [2] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii. c. ii. sec. 6. Also in his      letter to Alvar sending the \"Mem. Sanct.,\" he says, very few      remained firm to their principles.        [3] Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 9--\"Cum palam coram ethnicis      orationem non faciunt, signo crucis oscitantes frontem non      muniunt ... Christianos contra fidei suae socios pro regis      gratia, pro vendibilibus muneribus et defensione gentilicia      praeliantes.\" Elsewhere he says: \"Nullus invenitur qui iuxta      iussum Domini tonantis aetherii super montes Babiloniae,      caligosasque turres crucis fidei attollat vexillum, sacrificium      Deo offerens vespertinum.\"        [4] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" iii. c. iv. sec. 5: Alvar, \"Ind.      Lum.,\" sec. 18. See above, p. 51.        [5] Ibn al Kuttiya--apud Dozy, ii. 137.        [6] Eulog., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" iii. c. ii.

THE MUZARABES.      The death of Eulogius was a signal for the cessation of the dubious  martyrdoms which had for some years become so common, though the spirit,  which prompted the self-deluded victims, was by no means stifled either  in Spain or the adjoining countries.[1] Yet the measures taken to put  down the mania for death succeeded in preventing any fresh outbreak for  some time.    Under the weak government of Abdallah (888-912) the Christians,  determining to lose their lives to better purpose than at the hands of  the executioner, rose in revolt, as will be related hereafter, in  several parts of Spain. After the battle of Aguilar, or Polei, in 891,  between the Arab and Spanish factions, 1000 of the defeated Christians  were given the choice of Islam or death, and all, save one, chose the  latter alternative.[2]    During the long reign of Abdurrahman III. (912-961) there were a few  isolated cases of martyrdom, which may as well be mentioned now. After  the great battle in the Vale of Rushes,[3] where Abdurrahman defeated  the kings of Navarre and Leon, one of the two fighting bishops, who were  taken prisoners on that occasion, gave, as a hostage for his own  release, a youth of fourteen, named Pelagius. The king, it is said,  smitten with his beauty, wished to work his abominable will upon the  boy, but his advances being rejected with disdain, the unhappy youth was  put to death with great barbarity, refusing to save his life by  apostasy.[4] A different version of the story is given by a Saxon nun of  Gaudersheim, named Hroswitha, who wrote a poem on the subject fifty  years later. She tells us that the king tried to kiss Pelagius, who  thereupon struck him in the face, and was in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],[0,"The Underground Railroad (#16)"],[1,"it better when I gets to work I don't meane for you to write the      same words that are written above but I wish you give her a      clear understanding where I am and Shall Remain here untel She      comes or I hears from her.

CLARISSA DAVIS.      ARRIVED DRESSED IN MALE ATTIRE.      Clarissa fled from Portsmouth, Va., in May, 1854, with two of her  brothers. Two months and a half before she succeeded in getting off,  Clarissa had made a desperate effort, but failed. The brothers  succeeded, but she was left. She had not given up all hope of escape,  however, and therefore sought \"a safe hiding-place until an opportunity  might offer,\" by which she could follow her brothers on the U.G.R.R.  Clarissa was owned by Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Burkley, of Portsmouth, under  whom she had always served.    Of them she spoke favorably, saying that she \"had not been used as hard  as many others were.\" At this period, Clarissa was about twenty-two  years of age, of a bright brown complexion, with handsome features,  exceedingly respectful and modest, and possessed all the characteristics  of a well-bred young lady. For one so little acquainted with books as  she was, the correctness of her speech was perfectly astonishing.    For Clarissa and her two brothers a \"reward of one thousand dollars\" was  kept standing in the papers for a length of time, as these (articles)  were considered very rare and valuable; the best that could be produced  in Virginia.    In the meanwhile the brothers had passed safely on to New Bedford, but  Clarissa remained secluded, \"waiting for the storm to subside.\" Keeping  up courage day by day, for seventy-five days, with the fear of being  detected and severely punished, and then sold, after all her hopes and  struggles, required the faith of a martyr. Time after time, when she  hoped to succeed in making her escape, ill luck seemed to disappoint  her, and nothing but intense suffering appeared to be in store. Like  many others, under the crushing weight of oppression, she thought she  \"should have to die\" ere she tasted liberty. In this state of mind, one  day, word was conveyed to her that the steamship, City of Richmond, had  arrived from Philadelphia, and that the steward on board (with whom she  was acquainted), had consented to secrete her this trip, if she could  manage to reach the ship safely, which was to start the next day. This  news to Clarissa was both cheering and painful. She had been \"praying  all the time while waiting,\" but now she felt \"that if it would only  rain right hard the next morning about three o'clock, to drive the  police officers off the street, then she could safely make her way to  the boat.\" Therefore she prayed anxiously all that day that it would  rain, \"but no sign of rain appeared till towards midnight.\" The prospect  looked horribly discouraging; but she prayed on, and at the appointed  hour (three o'clock--before day), the rain descended in torrents.  Dressed in male attire, Clarissa left the miserable coop where she had  been almost without light or air for two and a half months, and  unmolested, reached the boat safely, and was secreted in a box by Wm.  Bagnal, a clever young man who sincerely sympathized with the slave,  having a wife in slavery himself; and by him she was safely delivered  into the hands of the Vigilance Committee.    Clarissa Davis here, by advice of the Committee, dropped her old name,  and was straightway christened \"Mary D. Armstead.\" Desiring to join her  brothers and sister in New Bedford, she was duly furnished with her  U.G.R.R. passport and directed thitherward. Her father, who was left  behind when she got off, soon after made his way on North, and joined  his children. He was too old and infirm probably to be worth anything,  and had been allowed to go free, or to purchase himself for a mere  nominal sum. Slaveholders would, on some such occasions, show wonderful  liberality in letting their old slaves go free, when they could work no  more. After reaching New Bedford, Clarissa manifested her gratitude in  writing to her friends in Philadelphia repeatedly, and evinced a very  lively interest in the U.G.R.R. The appended letter indicates her  sincere feelings of gratitude and deep interest in the cause--          NEW BEDFORD, August 26, 1855.        MR.

Yours respectfully,        MARY D. ARMSTEAD.               *       *       *       *       *          ANTHONY BLOW, ALIAS HENRY LEVISON.      SECRETED TEN MONTHS BEFORE STARTING--EIGHT DAYS STOWED AWAY ON A STEAMER  BOUND FOR PHILADELPHIA.      Arrived from Norfolk, about the 1st of November, 1854. Ten months before  starting, Anthony had been closely concealed. He belonged to the estate  of Mrs. Peters, a widow, who had been dead about one year before his  concealment.    On the settlement of his old mistress' estate, which was to take place  one year after her death, Anthony was to be transferred to Mrs. Lewis, a  daughter of Mrs. Peters (the wife of James Lewis, Esq.). Anthony felt  well satisfied that he was not the slave to please the \"tyrannical  whims\" of his anticipated master, young Lewis, and of course he hated  the idea of having to come under his yoke. And what made it still more  unpleasant for Anthony was that Mr. Lewis would frequently remind him  that it was his intention to \"sell him as soon as he got possession--the  first day of January.\" \"I can get fifteen hundred dollars for you  easily, and I will do it.\" This contemptuous threat had caused Anthony's  blood to boil time and again. But Anthony had to take the matter as  calmly as possible, which, however, he was not always able to do.    At any rate, Anthony concluded that his \"young master had counted the  chickens before they were hatched.\" Indeed here Anthony began to be a  deep thinker. He thought, for instance, that he had already been shot  three times, at the instance of slave-holders. The first time he was  shot was for refusing a flogging when only eighteen years of age. The  second time, he was shot in the head with squirrel shot by the sheriff,  who was attempting to arrest him for having resisted three \"young white  ruffians,\" who wished to have the pleasure of beating him, but got  beaten themselves. And in addition to being shot this time, Anthony was  still further \"broke in\" by a terrible flogging from the Sheriff. The  third time Anthony was shot he was about twenty-one years of age. In  this instance he was punished for his old offence--he \"would not be  whipped.\"    This time his injury from being shot was light, compared with the two  preceding attacks. Also in connection with these murderous conflicts, he  could not forget that he had been sold on the auction block. But he had  still deeper thinking to do yet. He determined that his young master  should never get \"fifteen hundred dollars for him on the 1st of  January,\" unless he got them while he (Anthony) was running. For Anthony  had fully made up his mind that when the last day of December ended, his  bondage should end also, even if he should have to accept death as a  substitute. He then began to think of the Underground Rail Road and of  Canada; but who the agents were, or how to find the depot, was a serious  puzzle to him. But his time was getting so short he was convinced that  whatever he did would have to be done quickly. In this frame of mind he  found a man who professed to know something about the Underground Rail  Road, and for \"thirty dollars\" promised to aid him in the matter.    The thirty dollars were raised by the hardest effort and passed over to  the pretended friend, with the expectation that it would avail greatly  in the emergency. But Anthony found himself sold for thirty dollars, as  nothing was done for him. However, the 1st day of January arrived, but  Anthony was not to be found to answer to his name at roll call. He had  \"took out\" very early in the morning. Daily he prayed in his place of  concealment how to find the U.G.R.R. Ten months passed away, during  which time he suffered almost death, but persuaded himself to believe  that even that was better than slavery. With Anthony, as it has been  with thousands of others similarly situated, just as everything was  looking the most hopeless, word came to him in his place of concealment  that a friend named Minkins, employed on the steamship City of Richmond,  would undertake to conceal him on the boat, if he could be crowded in a  certain place, which was"]]]
