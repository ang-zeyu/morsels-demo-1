But, three months previous to Cabral's touching upon Brazil, one of  Columbus's companions on his first voyage, Vincenta Yanez Pinzon,  had touched on the coast of Brazil, eight degrees south of the  line, and from there had worked northward, seeking for a passage  which would lead west to the Indies. He discovered the mouth of  the Amazon, but, losing two of his vessels, returned to Palos,  which he reached in September 1500.    This discovery of an unknown and unsuspected continent so far south  of the line created great interest, and shortly after Cabral's  return Amerigo Vespucci was sent out in 1501 by the King of Portugal  as pilot of a fleet which should explore the new land discovered  by Cabral and claim it for the Crown of Portugal. His instructions  were to ascertain how much of it was within the line of demarcation.  Vespucci reached the Brazilian coast at Cape St. Roque, and then  explored it very thoroughly right down to the river La Plata, which  was too far west to come within the Portuguese sphere. Amerigo  and his companions struck out south-eastward till they reached  the island of St. Georgia, 1200 miles east of Cape Horn, where  the cold and the floating ice drove them back, and they returned  to Lisbon, after having gone farthest south up to their time.    [Illustration: AMERIGO VESPUCCI.]    This voyage of Amerigo threw a new light upon the nature of the  discovery made by Columbus. Whereas he had thought he had discovered  a route to India and had touched upon Farther India, Amerigo and  his companions had shown that there was a hitherto unsuspected land  intervening between Columbus's discoveries and the long-desired Spice  Islands of Farther India. Amerigo, in describing his discoveries,  ventured so far as to suggest that they constituted a New World;  and a German professor, named Martin Waldseemueller, who wrote an  introduction to Cosmography in 1506, which included an account  of Amerigo's discoveries, suggested that this New World should  be called after him, AMERICA, after the analogy of Asia, Africa,  and Europe. For a long time the continent which we now know as  South America was called simply the New World, and was supposed  to be joined on to the east coast of Asia. The name America was  sometimes applied to it--not altogether inappropriately, since  it was Amerigo's voyage which definitely settled that really new  lands had been discovered by the western route; and when it was  further ascertained that this new land was joined, not to Asia,  but to another continent as large as itself, the two new lands  were distinguished as North and South America.    It was, at any rate, clear from Amerigo's discovery that the westward  route to the Spice Islands would have to be through or round this  New World discovered by him, and a Portuguese noble, named Fernao  Magelhaens, was destined to discover the practicability of this  route. He had served his native country under Almeida and Albuquerque  in the East Indies, and was present at the capture of Malacca in  1511, and from that port was despatched by Albuquerque with three  ships to visit the far-famed Spice Islands. They visited Amboyna  and Banda, and learned enough of the abundance and cheapness of  the spices of the islands to recognise their importance; but under  the direction of Albuquerque, who only sent them out on an exploring  expedition, they returned to him, leaving behind them, however, one  of Magelhaens' greatest friends, Francisco Serrao, who settled in  Ternate and from time to time sent glowing accounts of the Moluccas  to his friend Magelhaens. He in the meantime returned to Portugal,  and was employed on an expedition to Morocco. He was not, however,  well treated by the Portuguese monarch, and determined to leave  his service for that of Charles V., though he made it a condition  of his entering his service that he should make no discoveries  within the boundaries of the King of Portugal, and do nothing  prejudicial to his interests.    [Illustration: FERDINAND MAGELLAN.]    This was in the year 1517, and two years elapsed before Magelhaens  started on his celebrated voyage. He had represented to the Emperor  that he was convinced that a strait existed which would lead into  the Indian Ocean, past the New World of Amerigo, and that the Spice  Islands were beyond the line of demarcation and within the Spanish  sphere of influence. There is some evidence that Spanish merchant  vessels, trading secretly to obtain Brazil wood, had already caught  sight of the strait afterwards named after Magelhaens, and certainly  such a strait is represented upon Schoner's globes dated 1515 and  1520--earlier than Magelhaens' discovery. The Portuguese were fully  aware of the dangers threatened to their monopoly of the spice  trade--which by this time had been firmly established--owing to the  presence of Serrao in Ternate, and did all in their power to dissuade  Charles from sending out the threatened expedition, pointing out  that they would consider it an unfriendly act if such an expedition  were permitted to start. Notwithstanding this the Emperor persisted  in the project, and on Tuesday, 20th September 1519, a fleet of five  vessels, the _Trinidad, St. Antonio, Concepcion, Victoria_, and _St.  Jago_, manned by a heterogeneous collection of Spaniards, Portuguese,  Basques, Genoese, Sicilians, French, Flemings, Germans, Greeks,  Neapolitans, Corfiotes, Negroes, Malays, and a single Englishman  (Master Andrew of Bristol), started from Seville upon perhaps the  most important voyage of discovery ever made. So great was the  antipathy between Spanish and Portuguese that disaffection broke  out almost from the start, and after the mouth of the La Plata  had been carefully explored, to ascertain whether this was not  really the beginning of a passage through the New World, a mutiny  broke out on the 2nd April 1520, in Port St. Julian, where it had  been determined to winter; for of course by this time the sailors  had become aware that the time of the seasons was reversed in the  Southern Hemisphere. Magelhaens showed great firmness and skill in  dealing with the mutiny; its chief leaders were either executed or  marooned, and on the 18th October he resumed his voyage. Meanwhile  the habits and customs of the natives had been observed--their  huge height and uncouth foot-coverings, for which Magelhaens gave  them the name of Patagonians. Within three days they had arrived  at the entrance of the passage which still bears Magelhaens' name.  By this time one of the ships, the _St Jago_, had been lost, and it  was with only four of his vessels--the _Trinidad_, the _Victoria_,  the _Concepcion_. and the _St. Antonio_--that, Magelhaens began  his passage. There are many twists and divisions in the strait,  and on arriving at one of the partings, Magelhaens despatched the  _St. Antonio_ to explore it, while he proceeded with the other  three ships along the more direct route. The pilot of the _St.  Antonio_ had been one of the mutineers, and persuaded the crew  to seize this opportunity to turn back altogether; so that when  Magelhaens arrived at the appointed place of junction, no news  could be ascertained of the missing vessel; it went straight back  to Portugal. Magelhaens determined to continue his search, even,  he said, if it came to eating the leather thongs of the sails.  It had taken him thirty-eight days to get through the Straits,  and for four months afterwards Magelhaens continued his course  through the ocean, which, from its calmness, he called Pacific;  taking a north-westerly course, and thus, by a curious chance,  only hitting upon a couple of small uninhabited islands throughout  their whole voyage, through a sea which we now know to be dotted  by innumerable inhabited islands. On the 6th March 1520 they had  sighted the Ladrones, and obtained much-needed provisions. Scurvy  had broken out in its severest form, and the only Englishman on  the ships died at the Ladrones. From there they went on to the  islands now known as the Philippines, one of the kings of which  greeted them very favourably. As a reward Magelhaens undertook  one of his local quarrels, and fell in an unequal fight at Mactan,  27th April 1521. The three vessels continued their course for the  Moluccas, but the _Concepcion_ proved so unseaworthy that they had  to beach and burn her. They reached Borneo, and here Juan Sebastian  del Cano was appointed captain of the _Victoria_.    At last, on the 6th November 1521, they reached the goal of their  journey, and anchored at Tidor, one of the Moluccas. They traded  on very advantageous terms with the natives, and filled their holds  with the spices and nutmegs for which they had journeyed so far;  but when they attempted to resume their journey homeward, it was  found that the _Trinidad_ was too unseaworthy to proceed at once,  and it was decided that the _Victoria_ should start so as to get  the east monsoon. This she did, and after the usual journey round  the Cape of Good Hope, arrived off the Mole of Seville on Monday  the 8th September 1522--three years all but twelve days from the  date of their departure from Spain. Of the two hundred and seventy  men who had started with the fleet, only eighteen returned in the  _Victoria_. According to the ship's reckoning they had arrived  on Sunday the 7th, and for some time it was a puzzle to account  for the day thus lost.    Meanwhile the _Trinidad_, which had been left behind at the Moluccas,  had attempted to sail back to Panama, and reached as far north as  43 deg., somewhere about longitude 175 deg. W. Here provisions failed them,  and they had to return to the Moluccas, where they were seized,  practically as pirates, by a fleet of Portuguese vessels sent specially  to prevent interference by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#16)"],[1,"/2 cup grated cheese  1 tablespoon flour  Salt  Paprika         Into the stiff egg whites fold the cheese, flour and seasonings.       When thoroughly mixed pat into shape desired, roll in crumbs and       fry.       Roquefort Puffs    1/8 pound genuine French Roquefort  1 egg white, beaten stiff  8 crackers or 2-inch bread rounds         Cream the Roquefort, fold in the egg white, pile on crackers and       bake 15 minutes in slow oven.    The constant repetition of \"beaten stiff\" in these recipes may give  the impression that the whites are badly beaten up, but such is not  the case. They are simply whipped to peaks and left moist and  glistening as a teardrop, with a slight sad droop to them that shows  there is still room for the air to expand and puff things up in  cooking.       Parmesan Puffs         Make a spread of mayonnaise or other salad dressing with equal       parts of imported Parmesan, grated fine. Spread on a score or       more of crackers in a roomy pan and broil a couple of minutes       till they puff up golden-brown.         Use only the best Parmesan, imported from Italy; or, second best,       from Argentina where the rich pampas grass and Italian settlers       get together on excellent Parmesan and Romano. Never buy Parmesan       already grated; it quickly loses its flavor.       Breakfast Puffs    1 cup flour  1 cup milk  1/4 cup finely grated cheese  1 egg, lightly beaten  1/2 teaspoon salt         Mix all together to a smooth, light batter and fill ramekins or       cups half full; then bake in quick oven until they are puffing       over the top and golden-brown.       Danish Fondue Puffs    1 stale roll  1/2 cup boiling hot milk  Salt  Pepper  2 cups freshly grated Cheddar cheese  4 egg yolks, beaten lemon-yellow  4 egg whites, beaten stiff         Soak roll in boiling milk and beat to a paste. Mix with cheese       and egg yolks. When smooth and thickened fold in the egg whites       and fill ramekins, tins, cups or paper forms and slowly bake       until puffed up and golden-brown.       New England Cheese Puffs    1 cup sifted flour  1 teaspoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon Hungarian paprika  1/4 teaspoon dry mustard  2 egg yolks, beaten lemon-yellow  1/2 cup milk  1 cup freshly grated Cheddar cheese  2 egg whites, beaten stiff but not dry         Sift dry ingredients together, mix yolks with milk and stir in.       Add cheese and when thoroughly incorporated fold in the egg       whites to make a smooth batter. Drop from a big spoon into hot       deep fat and cook until well browned.         Caraway seeds are sometimes added. Poppy seeds are also used, and       either of these makes a snappier puff, especially tasty when       served with soup.         A few drops of tabasco give this an extra tang.       Cream Cheese Puffs    1/2 pound cream cheese  1 cup milk  4 eggs, lightly beaten  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon dry mustard         Soften cheese by heating over hot water. Remove from heat and add       milk, eggs and seasoning. Beat until well blended, then pour into       custard cups, ramekins or any other individual baking dishes that       are attractive enough to serve the puffs in.      RAMEKINS OR RAMEQUINS      Some Ramekin dishes are made so exquisitely that they may be collected  like snuff bottles.    Ramekins are utterly French, both the cooked Puffs and the individual  dishes in which they are baked. Essentially a Cheese Puff, this is  also _au gratin_ when topped with both cheese and browned bread  crumbs. By a sort of poetic cook's license the name is also applied to  any kind of cake containing cheese and cooked in the identifying  one-portion ramekin. It is used chiefly in the plural, however,  together with the name of the chief ingredient, such as \"Chicken  Ramekins\" and:       Cheese Ramekins I    2 eggs  2 tablespoons flour  1/8 pound butter, melted  1/8 pound grated cheese         Mix well and bake in individual molds for 15 minutes.       Cheese Ramekins II    3 tablespoons melted butter  1/2 teaspoon each, salt and pepper  3/4 cup bread crumbs  1/2 cup grated cheese  2 eggs, lightly beaten  1-1/2 cups milk         Mix the first four dry ingredients together, stir eggs into the       milk and add. Stir to a smooth batter and bake in buttered       ramekins, standing in water, in moderate oven. Serve piping hot,       for like Souffles and all associated Puffs, the hot air will puff       out of them quickly; then they will sink and be inedible.      TWO ANCIENT ENGLISH RECIPES, STILL GOING STRONG       Cheese Ramekins III         Grate 1/2 pound of any dry, rich cheese. Butter a dozen small       paper cases, or little boxes of stiff writing paper like Souffle       cases. Put a saucepan containing 1/2 pint of water over the fire,       add 2 tablespoons of butter, and when the water boils, stir in 1       heaping tablespoonful of flour. Beat the mixture until it shrinks       away from the sides of the saucepan; then stir in the grated       cheese. Remove the paste thus made from the fire, and let it       partly cool. In the meantime separate the yolks from the whites       of three eggs, and beat them until the yolks foam and the whites       make a stiff froth. Put the mixture at once into the buttered       paper cases, only half-filling them (since they rise very high       while being baked) with small slices of cheese, and bake in a       moderate oven for about 15 minutes. As soon as the Puffs are       done, put the cases on a hot dish covered with a folded napkin,       and serve very hot.    The most popular cheese for Ramekins has always been, and still is,  Gruyere. But because the early English also adopted Italian Parmesan,  that followed as a close second, and remains there today.    Sharp Cheddar makes tangy Ramekins, as will be seen in this second  oldster; for though it prescribes Gloucester and Cheshire  \"'arf-and-'arf,\" both are essentially Cheddars. Gloucester has been  called \"a glorified Cheshire\" and the latter has long been known as a  peculiarly rich and colorful elder brother of Cheddar, described in  Kenelme Digby's _Closet Open'd_ as a \"quick, fat, rich, well-tasted  cheese.\"       Cheese Ramekins IV         Scrape fine 1/4 pound of Gloucester cheese and 1/4 pound of       Cheshire cheese. Beat this scraped cheese in a mortar with the       yolks of 4 eggs, 1/4 pound of fresh butter, and the crumbs of a       French roll boiled in cream until soft. When all this is well       mixed and pounded to a paste, add the beaten whites of 4 eggs.       Should the paste seem too stiff, 1 or 2 tablespoons of sherry may       be added. Put the paste into paper cases, and bake in a Dutch       oven till nicely browned. The Ramekins should be served very hot.    Since both Gloucester cheese and Cheshire cheese are not easily come  by even in London today, it would be hard to reproduce this in the  States. So the best we can suggest is to use half-and-half of two of  our own great Cheddars, say half-Coon and half-Wisconsin Longhorn, or  half-Tillamook and half-Herkimer County. For there's no doubt about  it, contrasting cheeses tickle the taste buds, and as many as three  different kinds put together make Puffs all the more perfect.       Ramequins a la Parisienne    2 cups milk  1 cup cream  1 ounce salt butter  1 tablespoon flour  1/2 cup grated Gruyere  Coarsely ground pepper  An atom of nutmeg  A _soupcon_ of garlic  A light touch of powdered sugar  8 eggs, separated         Boil milk and cream together. Melt butter, mix in the flour and       stir over heat 5 minutes, adding the milk and cream mixture a       little at a time. When thoroughly cooked, remove from heat and       stir in cheese, seasonings and the yolks of all 8 eggs, well       beaten, and the whites of 2 even better beaten. When well mixed,       fold in the remaining egg whites, stiffly beaten, until you have       a batter as smooth and thick as cream. Pour this into ramekins of       paper, porcelain or earthenware, filling each about 2/3 full to       allow for them to puff up as they bake in a very slow oven until       golden-brown (or a little less than 20 minutes).       Le Ramequin Morezien         This celebrated specialty of Franche-Comte is described as \"a       porridge of water, butter, seasoning, chopped garlic and toast;       thickened with minced Gruyere and served very hot.\"    Several French provinces are known for distinctive individual Puffs  usually served in the dainty fluted forms they are cooked in. In  Jeanne d'Arc's Lorraine, for instance, there are the simply named _Les  Ramequins_, made of flour, Gruyere and eggs.       Swiss-Roquefort Ramekins    1/4 pound Swiss cheese  1/4 pound Roquefort cheese  1/2 pound butter  8 eggs, separated  4 breakfast rolls, crusts removed  1/2 cup cream         The batter is made in the usual way, with the soft insides of the       rolls simmered in the cream and stirred in. The egg whites are       folded in last, as always, the batter poured into ramekins part       full and baked to a golden-brown. Then they are served       instantaneously, lest they fall.     Puff Paste Ramekins         Puff or other pastry is rolled out fiat and sprinkled with fine       tasty cheese or any cheese mixture, such as Parmesan with Gruyere       and/or Swiss Sapsago for a piquant change, but in lesser quantity       than the other cheeses used. Parmesan cheese has long been the       favorite for these.         Fold paste into 3 layers, roll out again and dust with more       cheese. Fold once more and roll this out and cut in small fancy       shapes to bake 10 to 15 minutes in a hot oven. Brushing with egg       yolk before baking makes these Ramekins shine.       Frying Pan Ramekins         Melt 2 ounces of butter, let it cool a little and then mix with       1/2 pound of cheese. Fold in the whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiff       but not dry. Cover frying pan with buttered papers, put slices"]]]
