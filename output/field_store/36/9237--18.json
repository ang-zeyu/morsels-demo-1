[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#16)"],[1,"gination, is still grovelling on the level of sense.    We may, if we please, carry this scepticism a step further, and  deny, not only objects of sense, but the continuity of our sensations  themselves. We may say with Protagoras and Hume that what is appears,  and that what appears appears only to individuals, and to the same  individual only at one instant. But then, as Plato asks,--and we must  repeat the question,--What becomes of the mind? Experience tells us by a  thousand proofs that our sensations of colour, taste, and the like,  are the same as they were an instant ago--that the act which we are  performing one minute is continued by us in the next--and also  supplies abundant proof that the perceptions of other men are, speaking  generally, the same or nearly the same with our own. After having slowly  and laboriously in the course of ages gained a conception of a whole and  parts, of the constitution of the mind, of the relation of man to God  and nature, imperfect indeed, but the best we can, we are asked to  return again to the 'beggarly elements' of ancient scepticism, and  acknowledge only atoms and sensations devoid of life or unity. Why  should we not go a step further still and doubt the existence of the  senses of all things? We are but 'such stuff as dreams are made of;'  for we have left ourselves no instruments of thought by which we can  distinguish man from the animals, or conceive of the existence even of a  mollusc. And observe, this extreme scepticism has been allowed to spring  up among us, not, like the ancient scepticism, in an age when nature and  language really seemed to be full of illusions, but in the eighteenth  and nineteenth centuries, when men walk in the daylight of inductive  science.    The attractiveness of such speculations arises out of their true nature  not being perceived. They are veiled in graceful language; they are not  pushed to extremes; they stop where the human mind is disposed also to  stop--short of a manifest absurdity. Their inconsistency is not observed  by their authors or by mankind in general, who are equally inconsistent  themselves. They leave on the mind a pleasing sense of wonder and  novelty: in youth they seem to have a natural affinity to one class of  persons as poetry has to another; but in later life either we drift  back into common sense, or we make them the starting-points of a higher  philosophy.    We are often told that we should enquire into all things before we  accept them;--with what limitations is this true? For we cannot use  our senses without admitting that we have them, or think without  presupposing that there is in us a power of thought, or affirm that all  knowledge is derived from experience without implying that this first  principle of knowledge is prior to experience. The truth seems to be  that we begin with the natural use of the mind as of the body, and  we seek to describe this as well as we can. We eat before we know the  nature of digestion; we think before we know the nature of reflection.  As our knowledge increases, our perception of the mind enlarges also. We  cannot indeed get beyond facts, but neither can we draw any line which  separates facts from ideas. And the mind is not something separate  from them but included in them, and they in the mind, both having a  distinctness and individuality of their own. To reduce our conception of  mind to a succession of feelings and sensations is like the attempt to  view a wide prospect by inches through a microscope, or to calculate a  period of chronology by minutes. The mind ceases to exist when it loses  its continuity, which though far from being its highest determination,  is yet necessary to any conception of it. Even an inanimate nature  cannot be adequately represented as an endless succession of states or  conditions.    Paragraph II. Another division of the subject has yet to be considered:  Why should the doctrine that knowledge is sensation, in ancient times,  or of sensationalism or materialism in modern times, be allied to the  lower rather than to the higher view of ethical philosophy? At  first sight the nature and origin of knowledge appear to be wholly  disconnected from ethics and religion, nor can we deny that the ancient  Stoics were materialists, or that the materialist doctrines prevalent  in modern times have been associated with great virtues, or that both  religious and philosophical idealism have not unfrequently parted  company with practice. Still upon the whole it must be admitted that the  higher standard of duty has gone hand in hand with the higher conception  of knowledge. It is Protagoras who is seeking to adapt himself to  the opinions of the world; it is Plato who rises above them: the one  maintaining that all knowledge is sensation; the other basing the  virtues on the idea of good. The reason of this phenomenon has now to be  examined.    By those who rest knowledge immediately upon sense, that explanation of  human action is deemed to be the truest which is nearest to sense. As  knowledge is reduced to sensation, so virtue is reduced to feeling,  happiness or good to pleasure. The different virtues--the various  characters which exist in the world--are the disguises of self-interest.  Human nature is dried up; there is no place left for imagination, or in  any higher sense for religion. Ideals of a whole, or of a state, or of a  law of duty, or of a divine perfection, are out of place in an Epicurean  philosophy. The very terms in which they are expressed are suspected of  having no meaning. Man is to bring himself back as far as he is able to  the condition of a rational beast. He is to limit himself to the pursuit  of pleasure, but of this he is to make a far-sighted calculation;--he is  to be rationalized, secularized, animalized: or he is to be an amiable  sceptic, better than his own philosophy, and not falling below the  opinions of the world.    Imagination has been called that 'busy faculty' which is always  intruding upon us in the search after truth. But imagination is also  that higher power by which we rise above ourselves and the commonplaces  of thought and life. The philosophical imagination is another name for  reason finding an expression of herself in the outward world. To deprive  life of ideals is to deprive it of all higher and comprehensive aims and  of the power of imparting and communicating them to others. For men are  taught, not by those who are on a level with them, but by those who rise  above them, who see the distant hills, who soar into the empyrean. Like  a bird in a cage, the mind confined to sense is always being brought  back from the higher to the lower, from the wider to the narrower view  of human knowledge. It seeks to fly but cannot: instead of aspiring  towards perfection, 'it hovers about this lower world and the earthly  nature.' It loses the religious sense which more than any other seems to  take a man out of himself. Weary of asking 'What is truth?' it accepts  the 'blind witness of eyes and ears;' it draws around itself the curtain  of the physical world and is satisfied. The strength of a sensational  philosophy lies in the ready accommodation of it to the minds of men;  many who have been metaphysicians in their youth, as they advance in  years are prone to acquiesce in things as they are, or rather appear to  be. They are spectators, not thinkers, and the best philosophy is that  which requires of them the least amount of mental effort.    As a lower philosophy is easier to apprehend than a higher, so a lower  way of life is easier to follow; and therefore such a philosophy seems  to derive a support from the general practice of mankind. It appeals to  principles which they all know and recognize: it gives back to them in a  generalized form the results of their own experience. To the man of the  world they are the quintessence of his own reflections upon life. To  follow custom, to have no new ideas or opinions, not to be straining  after impossibilities, to enjoy to-day with just so much forethought as  is necessary to provide for the morrow, this is regarded by the greater  part of the world as the natural way of passing through existence. And  many who have lived thus have attained to a lower kind of happiness  or equanimity. They have possessed their souls in peace without ever  allowing them to wander into the region of religious or political  controversy, and without any care for the higher interests of man. But  nearly all the good (as well as some of the evil) which has ever been  done in this world has been the work of another spirit, the work of  enthusiasts and idealists, of apostles and martyrs. The leaders  of mankind have not been of the gentle Epicurean type; they have  personified ideas; they have sometimes also been the victims of them.  But they have always been seeking after a truth or ideal of which they  fell short; and have died in a manner disappointed of their hopes that  they might lift the human race out of the slough in which they found  them. They have done little compared with their own visions and  aspirations; but they have done that little, only because they sought to  do, and once perhaps thought that they were doing, a great deal more.    The philosophies of Epicurus or Hume give no adequate or dignified  conception of the mind. There is no organic unity in a succession of  feeling or sensations; no comprehensiveness in an infinity of separate  actions. The individual never reflects upon himself as a whole; he can  hardly regard one act or part of his life as the cause or effect of any  other act or part. Whether in practice or speculation, he is to himself  only in successive instants. To such thinkers, whether in ancient or in  modern times, the mind is only the poor recipient of impressions--not  the heir of all the ages, or connected with all other minds.

And it was so that the watchman spied  him from his tower, the watchman whom crafty Aegisthus had  led and posted there, promising him for a reward two  talents of gold. Now he kept watch for the space of a year,  lest Agamemnon should pass by him when he looked not, and  mind him of his wild prowess. So he went to the house to  bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people. And  straightway Aegisthus contrived a cunning treason. He chose  out twenty of the best men in the township, and set an  ambush, and on the further side of the hall he commanded to  prepare a feast. Then with chariot and horses he went to  bid to the feast Agamemnon, shepherd of the people; but  caitiff thoughts were in his heart. He brought him up to  his house, all unwitting of his doom, and when he had  feasted him slew him, as one slayeth an ox at the stall.  And none of the company of Atreides that were of his  following were left, nor any of the men of Aegisthus, but  they were all killed in the halls.\"    'So spake he, and my spirit within me was broken, and I  wept as I sat upon the sand, nor was I minded any more to  live and see the light of the sun. But when I had taken my  fill of weeping and grovelling on the ground, then spake  the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth:    '\"No more, son of Atreus, hold this long weeping without  cease, for we shall find no help therein. Rather with all  haste make essay that so thou mayest come to thine own  country. For either thou shalt find Aegisthus yet alive, or  it may be Orestes was beforehand with thee and slew him; so  mayest thou chance upon his funeral feast.\"    'So he spake, and my heart and lordly soul again were  comforted for all my sorrow, and I uttered my voice and I  spake to him winged words:    '\"Their fate I now know; but tell me of the third; who is  it that is yet living and holden on the wide deep, or  perchance is dead? and fain would I hear despite my  sorrow.\"    'So spake I, and straightway he answered, and said: \"It is  the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; and I saw  him in an island shedding big tears in the halls of the  nymph Calypso, who holds him there perforce; so he may not  come to his own country, for he has by him no ships with  oars, and no companions to send him on his way over the  broad back of the sea. But thou, Menelaus, son of Zeus, art  not ordained to die and meet thy fate in Argos, the  pasture-land of horses, but the deathless gods will convey  thee to the Elysian plain and the world's end, where is  Rhadamanthus of the fair hair, where life is easiest for  men. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain;  but always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill  West to blow cool on men; yea, for thou hast Helen to wife,  and thereby they deem thee to be son of Zeus.\"    'So spake he, and plunged into the heaving sea; but I  betook me to the ships with my godlike company, and my  heart was darkly troubled as I went. Now after I had come  down to the ship and to the sea, and had made ready our  supper, and immortal night had come on, then did we lay us  to rest upon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn shone  forth, the rosy-fingered, first of all we drew down our  ships to the fair salt sea and placed the masts and the  sails in the gallant ships, and the crew too climbed on  board, and sat upon the benches and smote the grey sea  water with their oars. Then back I went to the waters of  Aegyptus, the heaven-fed stream, and there I moored the  ships and offered the acceptable sacrifice of hecatombs. So  when I had appeased the anger of the everlasting gods, I  piled a barrow to Agamemnon, that his fame might never be  quenched. So having fulfilled all, I set out for home, and  the deathless gods gave me a fair wind, and brought me  swiftly to mine own dear country. But lo, now tarry in my  halls till it shall be the eleventh day hence or the  twelfth. Then will I send thee with all honour on thy way,  and give thee splendid gifts, three horses and a polished  car; and moreover I will give thee a goodly chalice, that  thou mayest pour forth before the deathless gods, and be  mindful of me all the days of thy life.'    Then wise Telemachus answered him, saying: 'Son of Atreus,  nay, hold me not long time here. Yea even for a year would  I be content to sit by thee, and no desire for home or  parents would come upon me; for I take wondrous pleasure in  thy tales and talk. But already my company wearieth in fair  Pylos, and yet thou art keeping me long time here. And  whatsoever gift thou wouldest give me, let it be a thing to  treasure; but horses I will take none to Ithaca, but leave  them here to grace thine own house, for thou art lord of a  wide plain wherein is lotus great plenty, and therein is  spear-reed and wheat and rye, and white and spreading  barley. In Ithaca there are no wide courses, nor meadow  land at all. It is a pasture-land of goats, and more  pleasant in my sight than one that pastureth horses; for of  the isles that lie and lean upon the sea, none are fit for  the driving of horses, or rich in meadow land, and least of  all is Ithaca.'    So spake he, and Menelaus, of the loud war cry, smiled, and  caressed him with his hand, and spake and hailed him:    'Thou art of gentle blood, dear child, so gentle the words  thou speakest. Therefore I will make exchange of the  presents, as I may. Of the gifts, such as are treasures  stored in my house, I will give thee the goodliest and  greatest of price. I will give thee a mixing bowl  beautifully wrought; it is all of silver, and the lips  thereof are finished with gold, the work of Hephaestus; and  the hero Phaedimus, the king of the Sidonians, gave it me,  when his house sheltered me on my coming thither, and to  thee now would I give it.'    Even so they spake one to another, while the guests came to  the palace of the divine king. They drave their sheep, and  brought wine that maketh glad the heart of man: and their  wives with fair tire sent them wheaten bread. Thus were  these men preparing the feast in the halls.    But the wooers meantime were before the palace of Odysseus,  taking their pleasure in casting of weights and spears, on  a levelled place, as heretofore, in their insolence. And  Antinous and god-like Eurymachus were seated there, the  chief men of the wooers, who were far the most excellent of  all. And Noemon, son of Phromius, drew nigh to them and  spake unto Antinous and questioned him, saying:    'Antinous, know we at all, or know we not, when Telemachus  will return from sandy Pylos? He hath departed with a ship  of mine, and I have need thereof, to cross over into  spacious Elis, where I have twelve brood mares with hardy  mules unbroken at the teat; I would drive off one of these  and break him in.'    So spake he, and they were amazed, for they deemed not that  Telemachus had gone to Neleian Pylos, but that he was at  home somewhere in the fields, whether among the flocks, or  with the swineherd.    Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake to him in turn:  'Tell me the plain truth; when did he go, and what noble  youths went with him? Were they chosen men of Ithaca or  hirelings and thralls of his own? He was in case to bring  even that about. And tell me this in good sooth, that I may  know for a surety: did he take thy black ship from thee  perforce against thy will? or didst thou give it him of  free will at his entreaty?    Then Noemon, son of Phromius, answered him saying: 'I gave  it him myself of free will. What can any man do, when such  an one, so bestead with care, begs a favour? it were hard  to deny the gift. The youths who next to us are noblest in  the land, even these have gone with him; and I marked their  leader on board ship, Mentor, or a god who in all things  resembled Mentor. But one matter I marvel at: I saw the  goodly Mentor here yesterday toward dawn, though already he  had embarked for Pylos.'    He spake and withal departed to his father's house. And the  proud spirits of these twain were angered, and they made  the wooers sit down together and cease from their games.  And among them spake Antinous, son of Eupeithes, in  displeasure; and his black heart was wholly filled with  rage, and his eyes were like flaming fire:    'Out on him, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished with  a high hand, even this journey, and we thought that he  would never bring it to pass! This lad hath clean gone  without more ado, in spite of us all; his ship he hath let  haul to the sea, and chosen the noblest in the township. He  will begin to be our bane even more than heretofore; but  may Zeus destroy his might, not ours, ere he reach the  measure of manhood! But come, give me a swift ship and  twenty men, that I may lie in watch and wait even for him  on his way home, in the strait between Ithaca and rugged  Samos, that so he may have a woeful end of his cruising in  quest of his father.'    So spake he, and they all assented thereto, and bade him to  the work. And thereupon they arose and went to the house of  Odysseus.    Now it was no long time before Penelope heard of the  counsel that the wooers had devised in the deep of their  heart. For the henchman Medon told her thereof, who stood  without the court and heard their purposes, while they were  weaving their plot within. So he went on his way through  the halls to bring the news to Penelope; and as he stept  down over the threshold, Penelope spake unto him:    'Henchman, wherefore have the noble wooers sent thee forth?  Was it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease  from their work, and prepare a banquet for them? Nay, after  thus much wooing, never again may they come together, but  here this day sup for their last and latest time;"]]]
