The  report alarmed the camp; drums beat the long roll and bugles sounded the  assembly, bringing swarms of half-clad men into the moonlight, dressing  as they ran, and falling into line at the sharp commands of their  officers. This was well; being in line the men were under control; they  stood at arms while the general's staff and the men of his escort  brought order out of confusion by lifting off the fallen tent and  pulling apart the breathless and bleeding actors in that strange  contention.    Breathless, indeed, was one: the captain was dead; the handle of the  bowie-knife, protruding from his throat, was pressed back beneath his  chin until the end had caught in the angle of the jaw and the hand that  delivered the blow had been unable to remove the weapon. In the dead  man's hand was his sword, clenched with a grip that defied the strength  of the living. Its blade was streaked with red to the hilt.    Lifted to his feet, the general sank back to the earth with a moan and  fainted. Besides his bruises he had two sword-thrusts--one through the  thigh, the other through the shoulder.    The spy had suffered the least damage. Apart from a broken right arm,  his wounds were such only as might have been incurred in an ordinary  combat with nature's weapons. But he was dazed and seemed hardly to know  what had occurred. He shrank away from those attending him, cowered upon  the ground and uttered unintelligible remonstrances. His face, swollen  by blows and stained with gouts of blood, nevertheless showed white  beneath his disheveled hair--as white as that of a corpse.    \"The man is not insane,\" said the surgeon, preparing bandages and  replying to a question; \"he is suffering from fright. Who and what is  he?\"    Private Tassman began to explain. It was the opportunity of his life; he  omitted nothing that could in any way accentuate the importance of his  own relation to the night's events. When he had finished his story and  was ready to begin it again nobody gave him any attention.    The general had now recovered consciousness. He raised himself upon his  elbow, looked about him, and, seeing the spy crouching by a camp-fire,  guarded, said simply:    \"Take that man to the parade ground and shoot him.\"    \"The general's mind wanders,\" said an officer standing near.    \"His mind does _not_ wander,\" the adjutant-general said. \"I have a  memorandum from him about this business; he had given that same order to  Hasterlick\"--with a motion of the hand toward the dead provost-marshal--  \"and, by God! it shall be executed.\"    Ten minutes later Sergeant Parker Adderson, of the Federal army,  philosopher and wit, kneeling in the moonlight and begging incoherently  for his life, was shot to death by twenty men. As the volley rang out  upon the keen air of the midnight, General Clavering, lying white and  still in the red glow of the camp-fire, opened his big blue eyes, looked  pleasantly upon those about him and said: \"How silent it all is!\"    The surgeon looked at the adjutant-general, gravely and significantly.  The patient's eyes slowly closed, and thus he lay for a few moments;  then, his face suffused with a smile of ineffable sweetness, he said,  faintly: \"I suppose this must be death,\" and so passed away.          AN AFFAIR OF OUTPOSTS    I    CONCERNING THE WISH TO BE DEAD    Two men sat in conversation. One was the Governor of the State. The year  was 1861; the war was on and the Governor already famous for the  intelligence and zeal with which he directed all the powers and  resources of his State to the service of the Union.    \"What! _you_?\" the Governor was saying in evident surprise--\"you too  want a military commission? Really, the fifing and drumming must have  effected a profound alteration in your convictions. In my character of  recruiting sergeant I suppose I ought not to be fastidious, but\"--there  was a touch of irony in his manner--\"well, have you forgotten that an  oath of allegiance is required?\"    \"I have altered neither my convictions nor my sympathies,\" said the  other, tranquilly. \"While my sympathies are with the South, as you do me  the honor to recollect, I have never doubted that the North was in the  right. I am a Southerner in fact and in feeling, but it is my habit in  matters of importance to act as I think, not as I feel.\"    The Governor was absently tapping his desk with a pencil; he did not  immediately reply. After a while he said: \"I have heard that there are  all kinds of men in the world, so I suppose there are some like that,  and doubtless you think yourself one. I've known you a long time and--  pardon me--I don't think so.\"    \"Then I am to understand that my application is denied?\"    \"Unless you can remove my belief that your Southern sympathies are in  some degree a disqualification, yes. I do not doubt your good faith, and  I know you to be abundantly fitted by intelligence and special training  for the duties of an officer. Your convictions, you say, favor the Union  cause, but I prefer a man with his heart in it. The heart is what men  fight with.\"    \"Look here, Governor,\" said the younger man, with a smile that had more  light than warmth: \"I have something up my sleeve--a qualification which  I had hoped it would not be necessary to mention. A great military  authority has given a simple recipe for being a good soldier: 'Try  always to get yourself killed.' It is with that purpose that I wish to  enter the service. I am not, perhaps, much of a patriot, but I wish to  be dead.\"    The Governor looked at him rather sharply, then a little coldly. \"There  is a simpler and franker way,\" he said.    \"In my family, sir,\" was the reply, \"we do not do that--no Armisted has  ever done that.\"    A long silence ensued and neither man looked at the other. Presently the  Governor lifted his eyes from the pencil, which had resumed its tapping,  and said:    \"Who is she?\"    \"My wife.\"    The Governor tossed the pencil into the desk, rose and walked two or  three times across the room. Then he turned to Armisted, who also had  risen, looked at him more coldly than before and said: \"But the man--  would it not be better that he--could not the country spare him better  than it can spare you? Or are the Armisteds opposed to 'the unwritten  law'?\"    The Armisteds, apparently, could feel an insult: the face of the younger  man flushed, then paled, but he subdued himself to the service of his  purpose.    \"The man's identity is unknown to me,\" he said, calmly enough.    \"Pardon me,\" said the Governor, with even less of visible contrition  than commonly underlies those words. After a moment's reflection he  added: \"I shall send you to-morrow a captain's commission in the Tenth  Infantry, now at Nashville, Tennessee. Good night.\"    \"Good night, sir. I thank you.\"    Left alone, the Governor remained for a time motionless, leaning against  his desk. Presently he shrugged his shoulders as if throwing off a  burden. \"This is a bad business,\" he said.    Seating himself at a reading-table before the fire, he took up the book  nearest his hand, absently opening it. His eyes fell upon this sentence:    \"When God made it necessary for an unfaithful wife to lie about her  husband in justification of her own sins He had the tenderness to endow  men with the folly to believe her.\"    He looked at the title of the book; it was, _His Excellency the Fool_.    He flung the volume into the fire.    II    HOW TO SAY WHAT IS WORTH HEARING    The enemy, defeated in two days of battle at Pittsburg Landing, had  sullenly retired to Corinth, whence he had come. For manifest  incompetence Grant, whose beaten army had been saved from destruction  and capture by Buell's soldierly activity and skill, had been relieved  of his command, which nevertheless had not been given to Buell, but to  Halleck, a man of unproved powers, a theorist, sluggish, irresolute.  Foot by foot his troops, always deployed in line-of-battle to resist the  enemy's bickering skirmishers, always entrenching against the columns  that never came, advanced across the thirty miles of forest and swamp  toward an antagonist prepared to vanish at contact, like a ghost at  cock-crow. It was a campaign of \"excursions and alarums,\" of  reconnoissances and counter-marches, of cross-purposes and countermanded  orders. For weeks the solemn farce held attention, luring distinguished  civilians from fields of political ambition to see what they safely  could of the horrors of war. Among these was our friend the Governor. At  the headquarters of the army and in the camps of the troops from his  State he was a familiar figure, attended by the several members of his  personal staff, showily horsed, faultlessly betailored and bravely  silk-hatted. Things of charm they were, rich in suggestions of peaceful  lands beyond a sea of strife. The bedraggled soldier looked up from his  trench as they passed, leaned upon his spade and audibly damned them to  signify his sense of their ornamental irrelevance to the austerities of  his trade.    \"I think, Governor,\" said General Masterson one day, going into informal  session atop of his horse and throwing one leg across the pommel of his  saddle, his favorite posture--\"I think I would not ride any farther in  that direction if I were you. We've nothing out there but a line of  skirmishers. That, I presume, is why I was directed to put these siege  guns here: if the skirmishers are driven in the enemy will die of  dejection at being unable to haul them away--they're a trifle heavy.\"    There is reason to fear that the unstrained quality of this military  humor dropped not as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],[0,"Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#16)"],[1,"    [1] Luke 1:16.

Our frail bodies, and God our preserver.    1 Let others boast how strong they be,  Nor death, nor danger fear;  But we'll confess, O Lord, to thee,  What feeble things we are.    2 Fresh as the grass our bodies stand,  And flourish bright and gay,  A blasting wind sweeps o'er the land,  And fades the grass away.    3 Our life contains a thousand springs,  And dies if one be gone;  Strange! that a harp of thousand strings  Should keep in tune so long.    4 But 'tis our God supports our frame,  The God that built us first;  Salvation to th' Almighty Name,  That rear'd us from the dust.    5 [He spoke, and straight our hearts and brains  In all their motions rose;  \"Let blood, (said he) flow round the veins,\"  And round the veins it flows.    6 While we have breath, or use our tongues,  Our Maker we'll adore;  His Spirit moves our heaving lungs  Or they would breathe no more.]      Hymn 2:20.  Backslidings and returns; or, The  inconstancy of our love.    1 Why is my heart so far from thee,  My God, my chief delight?  Why are my thoughts no more by day  With thee, no more by night?    2 [Why should my foolish passions rove?  Where can such sweetness be  As I have tasted in thy love;  As I have found in thee?]    3 When my forgetful soul renews  The savour of thy grace,  My heart presumes I cannot lose  The relish all my days.    4 But ere one fleeting hour is pass'd,  The flattering world employs  Some sensual bait to seize my taste,  And to pollute my joys.    5 [Trifles of nature or of art  With fair deceitful charms  Intrude upon my thoughtless heart,  And thrust thee from my arms.]    6 Then I repent and vex my soul  That I should leave thee so,  Where will those wild affections roll  That let a Saviour go?    7 [Sin's promis'd joys are turn'd to pain,  And I am drown'd in grief;  But my dear Lord returns again,  He flies to my relief.    8 Seizing my soul with sweet surprise  He draws with loving bands;  Divine compassion in his eyes,  And pardon in his hands.]    9 [Wretch that I am to wander thus  In chase of false delight!  Let me be fasten'd to thy cross,  Rather than lose thy sight.]    10 [Make haste, my days, to reach the goal,  And bring my heart to rest  On the dear centre of my soul,  My God, my Saviour's breast.]      Hymn 2:21.  A song of praise to God the Redeemer.    1 Let the old heathens tune their song  Of great Diana and of Jove;  But the sweet theme that moves my tongue  Is my Redeemer and his love.    2 Behold a God descends and dies  To save my soul from gaping hell;  How the black gulf where Satan lies  Yawn'd to receive me when I fell!    3 How justice frown'd and vengeance stood  To drive me down to endless pain!  But the great Son propos'd his blood,  And heavenly wrath grew mild again.    4 Infinite lover, gracious Lord,  To thee be endless honours given;  Thy wondrous Name shall be ador'd  Round the wide earth, and wider heaven.      Hymn 2:22.  With God is terrible majesty.    1 Terrible God, that reign'st on high,  How awful is thy thundering hand!  Thy fiery bolts how fierce they fly!  Nor can all earth or hell withstand.    2 This the old rebel angels knew,  And Satan fell beneath thy frown:  Thine arrows struck the traitor thro',  And weighty vengeance sunk him down.    3 This Sodom felt, and feels it still,  And roars beneath th' eternal load,  \"With endless burnings who can dwell,  \"Or bear the fury of a God!\"    4 Tremble, ye sinners, and submit,  Throw down your arms before his throne,  Bend your heads low beneath his feet,  Or his strong hand shall crush you down.    5 And ye, blest saints, that love him too,  With rev'rence bow before his Name,  Thus all his heavenly servants do:  God is a bright and burning flame.      Hymn 2:23.  The sight of God and Christ in heaven.    1 Descend from heaven, immortal Dove,  Stoop down and take us on thy wings,  And mount and bear us far above  The reach of these inferior things.    2 Beyond, beyond this lower sky,  Up where eternal ages roll,  Where solid pleasures never die,  And fruits immortal feast the soul.    3 O for a sight, a pleasing sight  Of our almighty Father's throne!  There sits our Saviour crown'd with light  Cloth'd in a body like our own.    4 Adoring saints around him stand,  And thrones, and powers before him fall;  The God shines gracious thro' the man,  And sheds sweet glories on them all.    5 O what amazing joys they feel  While to their golden harps they sing,  And sit on every heavenly hill,  And spread the triumphs of their King!    6 When shall the day, dear Lord, appear  That I shall mount to dwell above,  And stand and bow amongst them there,  And view thy face, and sing, and love!      Hymn 2:24.  The evil of sin visible in the fall of angels and men.    1 When the great Builder arch'd the skies,  And form'd all nature with a word,  The joyful cherubs tun'd his praise,  And every bending throne ador'd.    2 High in the midst of all the throng,  Satan, a tall archangel, sat,  Amongst the morning stars he sung [1]  Till sin destroy'd his heavenly state.    3 ['Twas sin that hurl'd him from his throne,  Grov'ling in fire the rebel lies:  \"How art thou sunk in darkness down,  \"Son of the morning, from the skies!\" [2]    4 And thus our two first parents stood  Till sin defil'd the happy place  They lost their garden and their God,  And ruin'd all their unborn race.    5 [So sprung the plague from Adam's bower,  And spread destruction all abroad;  Sin, the curs'd name, that in one hour  Spoil'd six days labour of a God.]    6 Tremble, my soul, and mourn for grief,  That such a foe should seize thy breast;  Fly to thy Lord for quick relief;  O! may he slay this treacherous guest.    Then to thy throne, victorious King,  Then to thy throne our shouts shall rise,  Thine everlasting arm we sing,  For sin the monster bleeds and dies.    [1] Job 38:7.  [2] Isaiah 14:12.      Hymn 2:25.  Complaining of spiritual sloth.    1 My drowsy powers, why sleep ye so?  Awake, my sluggish soul!  Nothing has half thy work to do,  Yet nothing's half so dull.    2 The little ants for one poor grain  Labour, and tug, and strive,  Yet we who have a heaven t' obtain,  How negligent we live!    3 We for whose sake all nature stands  And stars their courses move;  We for whose guard the angel bands  Come flying from above;    4 We for whom God the Son came down,  And labour'd for our good,  How careless to secure that crown  He purchas'd with his blood!    5 Lord, shall we lie so sluggish still,  And never act our parts?  Come, holy Dove, from th' heavenly hill,  And sit and warm our hearts.    6 Then shall our active spirits move,  Upward our souls shall rise:  With hands of faith and wings of love  We'll fly and take the prize.      Hymn 2:26.  God invisible.    1 Lord, we are blind, we mortals blind,  We can't behold thy bright abode;  O 'tis beyond a creature-mind  To glance a thought half-way to God.    2 Infinite leagues beyond the sky  The great Eternal reigns alone,  Where neither wings nor soul can fly,  Nor angels climb the topless throne.    3 The Lord of glory builds his seat  Of gems insufferably bright,  And lays beneath his sacred feet  Substantial beams of gloomy night.    4 Yet, glorious Lord, thy gracious eyes  Look thro', and cheer us from above;  Beyond our praise thy grandeur flies,  Yet we adore, and yet we love.      Hymn 2:27.  Praise ye him, all his angels, Psalm 148. 2.    1 God! the eternal awful Name  That the whole heavenly army fears,  That shakes the wide creation's frame,  And Satan trembles when he hears.    2 Like flames of fire his servants are,  And light surrounds his dwelling place;  But, O ye fiery flames, declare  The brighter glories of his face.    3 'Tis not for such poor worms as we  To speak so infinite a thing,  But your immortal eyes survey  The beauties of your sovereign King.    4 Tell how he shews his smiling face,  And clothes all heaven in bright array;  Triumph and joy run thro' the place,  And songs eternal as the day.    5 Speak, (for you feel his burning love)  What zeal it spreads thro' all your frame:  That sacred fire dwells all above,  For we on earth have lost the name.    6 [Sing of his power and justice too,  That infinite right-hand of his  That vanquish'd Satan and his crew,  And thunder drove them down from bliss.    7 [What mighty storms of poison'd darts  Were hurl'd upon the rebels there!  What deadly jav'lins nail'd their hearts  Fast to the racks of long despair!]    8 [Shout to your King, you heavenly host,  You that beheld the sinking foe;  Firmly ye stood when they were lost;  Praise the rich grace that kept you so.]    9 Proclaim his wonders from the skies,  Let every distant nation hear;  And while you sound his lofty praise,  Let humble mortals bow and fear.      Hymn 2:28.  Death and eternity.    1 Stoop down, my thoughts, that use to rise,  Converse awhile with death:  Think how a gasping mortal lies,  And pants away his breath.    2 His quivering lip hangs feebly down  His pulses faint and few,  Then, speechless, with a doleful groan  He bids the world adieu.    3 But, O the soul that never dies!  At once it leaves the clay!  Ye thoughts, pursue it where it flies,  And track its wondrous way.    4 Up to the courts where angels dwell,  It mounts triumphing there,  Or devils plunge it down to hell  In infinite despair.    5 And must my body faint and die?  And must this soul remove?  O for some guardian angel nigh  To bear it safe above!    6 Jesus, to thy dear faithful hand  My naked soul I trust,  And my flesh waits for thy command  To drop into my dust.      Hymn 2:29.  Redemption by price and power.    1 Jesus, with all thy saints above  My tongue would bear her part,  Would sound aloud thy saving love,  And sing thy bleeding heart.    2 Bless'd be the Lamb, my dearest Lord,  Who bought me with his blood,  And quench'd his Father's flaming sword  In his own vital blood:  "]]]
