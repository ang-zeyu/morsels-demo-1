This throws a new light on the Problem of Pain.    The Hermetists regard the chain of lives as continuous, and as forming a  part of one life of the individual, so that in consequence the rhythmic  swing is understood in this way, while it would be without meaning  unless the truth of reincarnation is admitted.    But the Hermetists claim that the Master or advanced student is able, to  a great degree, to escape the swing toward Pain, by the process of  Neutralization before mentioned. By rising on to the higher plane of the  Ego, much of the experience that comes to those dwelling on the lower  plane is avoided and escaped.    The Law of Compensation plays an important part in the lives of men and  women. It will be noticed that one generally \"pays the price\" of  anything he possesses or lacks. If he has one thing, he lacks  another--the balance is struck. No one can \"keep his penny and have the  bit of cake\" at the same time Everything has its pleasant and unpleasant  sides. The things that one gains are always paid for by the things that  one loses. The rich possess much that the poor lack, while the poor  often possess things that are beyond the reach of the rich. The  millionaire may have the inclination toward feasting, and the wealth  wherewith to secure all the dainties and luxuries of the table, while he  lacks the appetite to enjoy the same; he envies the appetite and  digestion of the laborer who lacks the wealth and inclinations of the  millionaire, and who gets more pleasure from his plain food than the  millionaire could obtain even if his appetite were not jaded, nor his  digestion ruined, for the wants, habits and inclinations differ. And so  it is through life. The Law of Compensation is ever in operation,  striving to balance and counter-balance, and always succeeding in time,  even though several lives may be required for the return swing of the  Pendulum of Rhythm.        CHAPTER XII    CAUSATION        \"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause;      everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a      name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of      causation, but nothing escapes the Law.\"--The Kybalion.    The great Sixth Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Cause and  Effect--embodies the truth that Law pervades the Universe; that nothing  happens by Chance; that Chance is merely a term indicating cause  existing but not recognized or perceived; that phenomena is continuous,  without break or exception.    The Principle of Cause and Effect underlies all scientific thought,  ancient and modern, and was enunciated by the Hermetic Teachers in the  earliest days. While many and varied disputes between the many schools  of thought have since arisen, these disputes have been principally upon  the details of the operations of the Principle, and still more often  upon the meaning of certain words. The underlying Principle of Cause and  Effect has been accepted as correct by practically all the thinkers of  the world worthy of the name. To think otherwise would be to take the  phenomena of the universe from the domain of Law and Order, and to  relegate it; to the control of the imaginary something which men have  called \"Chance.\"    A little consideration will show anyone that there is in reality no such  thing as pure chance. Webster defines the word \"Chance\" as follows: \"A  supposed agent or mode of activity other than a force, law or purpose;  the operation or activity of such agent; the supposed effect of such an  agent; a happening; fortuity; casualty, etc.\" But a little consideration  will show you that there can be no such agent as \"Chance,\" in the sense  of something outside of Law-something outside of Cause and Effect. How  could there be a something acting in the phenomenal universe,  independent of the laws, order, and continuity of the latter? Such a  something would be entirely independent of the orderly trend of the  universe, and therefore superior to it. We can imagine nothing outside  of THE ALL being outside of the Law, and that only because THE ALL is  the LAW in itself. There is no room in the universe for a something  outside of and independent of Law. The existence of such a Something  would render all Natural Laws ineffective, and would plunge the universe  into chaotic disorder and lawlessness.    A careful examination will show that what we call \"Chance\" is merely an  expression relating to obscure causes; causes that we cannot perceive;  causes that we cannot understand. The word Chance is derived from a word  Meaning \"to fall\" (as the falling of dice), the idea being that the fall  of the dice (and many other happenings) are merely a \"happening\"  unrelated to any cause. And this is the sense in which the term is  generally employed. But when the matter is closely examined, it is seen  that there is no chance whatsoever about the fall of the dice. Each time  a die falls, and displays a certain number, it obeys a law as infallible  as that which governs the revolution of the planets around the sun. Back  of the fall of the die are causes, or chains of causes, running back  further than the mind can follow. The position of the die in the box;  the amount of muscular energy expended in the throw; the condition of  the table, etc., etc., all are causes, the effect of which may be seen.  But back of these seen causes there are chains of unseen preceding  causes, all of which had a bearing upon the number of the die which fell  uppermost.    If a die be cast a great number of times, it will be found that the  numbers shown will be about equal, that is, there will be an equal  number of one-spot, two-spot, etc., coming uppermost. Toss a penny in  the air, and it may come down either \"heads\" or \"tails\"; but make a  sufficient number of tosses, and the heads and tails will about even up.  This is the operation of the law of average. But both the average and  the single toss come under the Law of Cause and Effect, and if we were  able to examine into the preceding causes, it would be clearly seen that  it was simply impossible for the die to fall other than it did, under  the same circumstances and at the same time. Given the same causes, the  same results will follow. There is always a \"cause\" and a \"because\" to  every event. Nothing ever \"happens\" without a cause, or rather a chain  of causes.    Some confusion has arisen in the minds of persons considering this  Principle, from the fact that they were unable to explain how one thing  could cause another thing--that is, be the \"creator\" of the second  thing. As a matter of fact, no \"thing\" ever causes or \"creates\" another  \"thing.\" Cause and Effect deals merely with \"events.\" An \"event\" is  \"that which comes, arrives or happens, as a result or consequent of some  preceding event.\" No event \"creates\" another event, but is merely a  preceding link in the great orderly chain of events flowing from the  creative energy of THE ALL. There is a continuity between all events  precedent, consequent and subsequent. There is a relation existing  between everything that has gone before, and everything that follows. A  stone is dislodged from a mountain side and crashes through a roof of a  cottage in the valley below. At first sight we regard this as a chance  effect, but when we examine the matter we find a great chain of causes  behind it. In the first place there was the rain which softened the  earth supporting the stone and which allowed it to fall; then back of  that was the influence of the sun, other rains, etc., which gradually  disintegrated the piece of rock from a larger piece; then there were the  causes which led to the formation of the mountain, and its upheaval by  convulsions of nature, and so on ad infinitum. Then we might follow up  the causes behind the rain, etc. Then we might consider the existence of  the roof In short, we would soon find ourselves involved in a mesh of  cause and effect, from which we would soon strive to extricate  ourselves.    Just as a man has two parents, and four grandparents, and eight  great-grandparents, and sixteen great-great-grandparents, and so on  until when, say, forty generations are calculated the numbers of  ancestors run into many millions--so it is with the number of causes  behind even the most trifling event or phenomena, such as the passage of  a tiny speck of soot before your eye. It is not an easy matter to trace  the bit of soot hack to the early period of the world's history when it  formed a part of a massive tree-trunk, which was afterward converted  into coal, and so on, until as the speck of soot it now passes before  your vision on its way to other adventures. And a mighty chain of  events, causes and effects, brought it to its present condition, and the  later is but one of the chain of events which will go to produce other  events hundreds of years from now. One of the series of events arising  from the tiny bit of soot was the writing of these lines, which caused  the typesetter to perform certain work; the proofreader to do likewise;  and which will arouse certain thoughts in your mind, and that of others,  which in turn will affect others, and so on, and on, and on, beyond the  ability of man to think further-and all from the passage of a tiny bit  of soot, all of which shows the relativity and association of things,  and the further fact that \"there is no great; there is no small, in the  mind that causeth all.\"    Stop to think a moment. If a certain man had not met a certain maid,  away back in the dim period of the Stone Age--you who are now reading  these lines would not now be here. And if, perhaps, the same couple had  failed to meet, we who now write these lines would not now "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],[0,"The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#16)"],[1,"taste for natural history, and acquired considerable  knowledge of the use of drugs; but he soon tired of the discipline and  escaped. For some years he wandered about in different parts of Italy,  living by his wits and by cheating. A goldsmith consulted him about a  hidden treasure; he pretended to invoke the aid of spirits, frightened  the goldsmith, got sixty ounces of gold from him to carry on his  incantations, left him in the lurch, and fled to Messina. In that  town he discovered an aged aunt who was sick; the aunt died, and left  her money to the Church. Balsamo assumed her family name, added a  title of nobility, and was known henceforward as the Count Alessandro  Cagliostro.    In Messina he met a mysterious person whom he calls Altotas, and from  whom, he says in his Memoir, he learnt much. The following account of  the meeting of Balsamo and the stranger is taken from Waite's book:  \"As he was promenading one day near the jetty at the extremity of the  port he encountered an individual singularly habited and possessed of  a most remarkable countenance. This person, aged apparently about  fifty years, seemed to be an Armenian, though, according to other  accounts, he was a Spaniard or Greek. He wore a species of caftan, a  silk bonnet, and the extremities of his breeches were concealed in a  pair of wide boots. In his left hand he held a parasol, and in his  right the end of a cord, to which was attached a graceful Albanian  greyhound.... Cagliostro saluted this grotesque being, who bowed  slightly, but with satisfied dignity. 'You do not reside in Messina,  signor?' he said in Sicilian, but with a marked foreign accent.  Cagliostro replied that he was tarrying for a few days, and they began  to converse on the beauty of the town and on its advantageous  situation, a kind of Oriental imagery individualising the eloquence of  the stranger, whose remarks were, moreover, adroitly adorned with a  few appropriate compliments.\"    Although the stranger said he received no one at his house he allowed  Cagliostro to visit him. After various mysterious doings the two went  off to Egypt, and afterwards to Malta, where they performed many  wonderful deeds before the Grand Master, who was much impressed. At  Malta Altotas died, or, at anyrate, vanished. Cagliostro then  travelled for some time, and was well received by noblemen,  ambassadors, and others in high position. At Rome he fell in love with  a young and beautiful lady, Lorenza Feliciani, and married her.    Cagliostro used his young wife as a decoy to attract rich and foolish  men. He and his wife thrived for a time, and accumulated money and  jewels; but a confederate betrayed them, and they fled to Venice, and  then wandered for several years in Italy, France, and England. They  seem to have made a living by the sale of lotions for the skin, and by  practising skilful deceptions.    About the year 1770 Cagliostro began to pose as an alchemist. After  another period of wandering he paid a second visit to London and  founded a secret society, based on (supposed) Egyptian rites, mingled  with those of freemasonry. The suggestion of this society is said to  have come from a curious book he picked up on a second-hand stall in  London. The society attracted people by the strangeness of its  initiatory rites, and the promises of happiness and wellbeing made by  its founder to those who joined it. Lodges were established in many  countries, many disciples were obtained, great riches were amassed,  and Cagliostro flourished exceedingly.    In his _Histoire du Merveilleux dans les Temps modernes_, Figuier,  speaking of Cagliostro about this period of his career, says:    \"He proclaimed himself the bearer of the mysteries of Isis and Anubis  from the far East.... He obtained numerous and distinguished  followers, who on one occasion assembled in great force to hear Joseph  Balsamo expound to them the doctrines of Egyptian freemasonry. At this  solemn convention he is said to have spoken with overpowering  eloquence;... his audience departed in amazement and completely  converted to the regenerated and purified masonry. None doubted that  he was an initiate of the arcana of nature, as preserved in the temple  of Apis at the era when Cambyses belaboured that capricious divinity.  From this moment the initiations into the new masonry were numerous,  albeit they were limited to the aristocracy of society. There are  reasons to believe that the grandees who were deemed worthy of  admission paid exceedingly extravagantly for the honour.\"    Cagliostro posed as a physician, and claimed the power of curing  diseases simply by the laying on of hands. He went so far as to assert  he had restored to life the dead child of a nobleman in Paris; the  discovery that the miracle was effected by substituting a living child  for the dead one caused him to flee, laden with spoil, to Warsaw, and  then to Strassburg.    Cagliostro entered Strassburg in state, amid an admiring crowd, who  regarded him as more than human. Rumour said he had amassed vast  riches by the transmutation of base metals into gold. Some people in  the crowd said he was the wandering Jew, others that he had been  present at the marriage feast of Cana, some asserted he was born  before the deluge, and one supposed he might be the devil. The  goldsmith whom he had cheated of sixty ounces of gold many years  before was in the crowd, and, recognising him, tried to stop the  carriage, shouting: \"Joseph Balsamo! It is Joseph! Rogue, where are my  sixty ounces of gold?\" \"Cagliostro scarcely deigned to glance at the  furious goldsmith; but in the middle of the profound silence which the  incident occasioned among the crowd, a voice, apparently in the  clouds, uttered with great distinctness the following words: 'Remove  this lunatic, who is possessed by infernal spirits.' Some of the  spectators fell on their knees, others seized the unfortunate  goldsmith, and the brilliant cortege passed on\" (Waite).    From Strassburg Cagliostro* went to Paris, where he lived in great  splendour, curing diseases, making gold and diamonds, mystifying and  duping people of all ranks by the splendid ritual and gorgeous  feasting of his secret society, and amassing riches. He got entangled  in the affair of the Diamond Necklace, and left Paris. Trying to  advance his society in Italy he was arrested by the agents of the  Inquisition, and imprisoned, then tried, and condemned to death. The  sentence was commuted to perpetual imprisonment. After two years in  the prison of San Angelo he died at the age of fifty.       *Transcriber's Note: Original \"Cagliosto\".          CHAPTER IX.    PARACELSUS AND SOME OTHER ALCHEMISTS.      The accounts which have come to us of the men who followed the pursuit  of the _One Thing_ are vague, scrappy, and confusing.    Alchemical books abound in quotations from the writings of _Geber_.  Five hundred treatises were attributed to this man during the middle  ages, yet we have no certain knowledge of his name, or of the time or  place of his birth. Hoefer says he probably lived in the middle of the  8th century, was a native of Mesopotamia, and was named _Djabar  Al-Konfi_. Waite calls him _Abou Moussah Djafar al-Sofi_. Some of the  mediaeval adepts spoke of him as the King of India, others called him a  Prince of Persia. Most of the Arabian writers on alchemy and medicine,  after the 9th century, refer to Geber as their master.    All the MSS. of writings attributed to Geber which have been examined  are in Latin, but the library of Leyden is said to possess some works  by him written in Arabic. These MSS. contain directions for preparing  many metals, salts, acids, oils, etc., and for performing such  operations as distillation, cupellation, dissolution, calcination, and  the like.    Of the other Arabian alchemists, the most celebrated in the middle  ages were _Rhasis_, _Alfarabi_, and _Avicenna_, who are supposed to  have lived in the 9th and 10th centuries.    The following story of Alfarabi's powers is taken from Waite's _Lives  of the Alchemystical Philosophers_:--      \"Alfarabi was returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca, when, passing    through Syria, he stopped at the Court of the Sultan, and entered    his presence, while he was surrounded by numerous sage persons,    who were discoursing with the monarch on the sciences. Alfarabi    ... presented himself in his travelling attire, and when the    Sultan desired he should be seated, with astonishing philosophical    freedom he planted himself at the end of the royal sofa. The    Prince, aghast at his boldness, called one of his officers, and in    a tongue generally unknown commanded him to eject the intruder.    The philosopher, however, promptly made answer in the same tongue:    'Oh, Lord, he who acts hastily is liable to hasty repentance.' The    Prince was equally astounded to find himself understood by the    stranger as by the manner in which the reply was given. Anxious to    know more of his guest he began to question him, and soon    discovered that he was acquainted with seventy languages. Problems    for discussion were then propounded to the philosophers, who had    witnessed the discourteous intrusion with considerable indignation    and disgust, but Alfarabi disputed with so much eloquence and    vivacity that he reduced all the doctors to silence, and they    began writing down his discourse. The Sultan then ordered his    musicians to perform for the diversion of the company. When they    struck up, the philosopher accompanied them on a lute with such    infinite grace and tenderness that he elicited the unmeasured    admiration of the whole distinguished assembly. At the request of    the Sultan he produced a piece of his own composing, sang it, and    accompanied it with great force and spirit to the delight of all    his hearers. The air was so sprightly that even the gravest    philosopher could not resist dancing, but by"]]]
