Then--then I learned to know your  friend. Oh, then! I felt, when I looked upon him, when I listened to  him, when we conversed together, I felt, I acknowledged that there  might be happiness on earth, of which I had hitherto never dreamed.  Then I loved for the first time, ardently, passionately, and was  beloved in return. Acquainted with the family engagements, he did not  dare openly to proclaim his love, and I knew I ought not to foster  the feeling; but, alas! how seldom does passion listen to the voice  of reason and of duty. Your friend and I met in secret; in secret we  plighted our troth, and exchanged those rings, and hoped and believed  that by showing a bold front to our destiny we should subdue it to our  will. The commencement was sinful, it has met with a dire retribution,  Jules's letters announced his speedy return. He had sold everything  in his own country, had given up all his mercantile affairs, through  which he had greatly increased an already considerable fortune, and  now he was about to join us, or rather me, without whom he could not  live. This appeared to me like the demand for payment of a heavy debt.  This debt I owed to Jules, who loved me with all his heart, who was  in possession of my father's promised word and mine also. Yet I could  not give up your friend. In a state of distraction I told him all; we  meditated flight. Yes, I was so far guilty, and I make the confession  in hopes that some portion of my errors may be expiated by repentance.  My father, who had long been in a declining state, suddenly grew  worse, and this delayed and hindered the fulfillment of our designs.  Jules arrived. During the five years he had been away he was much  changed in appearance, and that advantageously. I was struck when  I first saw him, but it was also easy to detect in those handsome  features and manly bearing, a spirit of restlessness and violence  which had already shown itself in him as a boy, and which passing  years, with their bitter experience and strong passions, had greatly  developed. The hope that we had cherished of D'Effernay's possible  indifference to me, of the change which time might have wrought in  his attachment, now seemed idle and absurd. His love was indeed  impassioned. He embraced me in a manner that made me shrink from him,  and altogether his deportment toward me was a strange contrast to  the gentle, tender, refined affection of our dear friend. I trembled  whenever Jules entered the room, and all that I had prepared to say  to him, all the plans which I had revolved in my mind respecting  him, vanished in an instant before the power of his presence, and  the almost imperative manner in which he claimed my hand. My father's  illness increased; he was now in a very precarious state, hopeless  indeed. Jules rivaled me in filial attentions to him, that I can never  cease to thank him for; but this illness made my situation more and  more critical, and it accelerated the fulfillment of the contract.  I was now to renew my promise to him by the death-bed of my father.  Alas, alas! I fell senseless to the ground when this announcement  was made to me. Jules began to suspect. Already my cold, embarrassed  manner toward him since his return had struck him as strange. He began  to suspect, I repeat, and the effect that this suspicion had on him,  it would be impossible to describe to you. Even now, after so long a  time, now that I am accustomed to his ways, and more reconciled to my  fate by the side of a noble, though somewhat impetuous man, it makes  me tremble to think of those paroxysms, which the idea that I did not  love him called forth. They were fearful; he nearly sank under them.  During two days his life was in danger. At last the storm passed, my  father died; Jules watched over me with the tenderness of a brother,  the solicitude of a parent; for that indeed I shall ever be grateful.  His suspicion once awakened, he gazed round with penetrating looks  to discover the cause of my altered feelings. But your friend never  came to our house; we met in an unfrequented spot, and my father's  illness had interrupted these interviews. Altogether I cannot tell  if Jules discovered anything. A fearful circumstance rendered all  our precautions useless, and cut the knot of our secret connection,  to loose which voluntarily I felt I had no power. A wedding feast,  at a neighboring castle, assembled all the nobility and gentry, and  officers quartered near, together; my deep mourning was an excuse for  my absence. Jules, though he usually was happiest by my side, could  not resist the invitation, and your friend resolved to go, although he  was unwell; he feared to raise suspicion by remaining away, when I was  left at home. With great difficulty he contrived the first day to make  one at a splendid hunt, the second day he could not leave his bed.  A physician, who was in the house, pronounced his complaint to be  violent fever, and Jules, whose room joined that of the sick man,  offered him every little service and kindness which compassion and  good feeling prompted; and I cannot but praise him all the more for  it, as who can tell, perhaps, his suspicion might have taken the right  direction? On the morning of the second day--but let me glance quickly  at that terrible time, the memory of which can never pass from my  mind--a fit of apoplexy most unexpectedly, but gently, ended the  noblest life, and separated us forever! Now you know all. I inclose  the ring. I cannot write more. Farewell!\"    The conclusion of the letter made a deep impression on Edward. His  dream rose up before his remembrance, the slight indisposition, the  sudden death, the fearful nursetender, all arranged themselves in  order before his mind, and an awful whole rose out of all these  reflections, a terrible suspicion which he tried to throw off. But  he could not do so, and when he met the captain and D'Effernay  in the evening, and the latter challenged his visitors to a game  of billiards, Edward glanced from time to time at his host in  a scrutinizing manner, and could not but feel that the restless  discontent which was visible in his countenance, and the unsteady  glare of his eyes, which shunned the fixed look of others, only fitted  too well into the shape of the dark thoughts which were crossing his  own mind. Late in the evening, after supper, they played whist in  Emily's boudoir. On the morrow, if the weather permitted, they were  to conclude their inspection of the surrounding property, and the next  day they were to visit the iron foundries, which, although distant  from the Castle several miles, formed a very important item in the  rent-roll of the estates. The company separated for the night.  Edward fell asleep; and the same dream, with the same circumstances,  recurred, only with the full consciousness that the sick man  was Ferdinand. Edward felt overpowered, a species of horror  took possession of his mind, as he found himself now in regular  communication with the beings of the invisible world.    The weather favored D'Effernay's projects. The whole day was passed  in the open air. Emily only appeared at meals, and in the evening when  they played at cards. Both she and Edward avoided, as if by mutual  consent, every word, every look that could awaken the slightest  suspicion or jealous feeling in D'Effernay's mind. She thanked him  in her heart for this forbearance, but her thoughts were in another  world; she took little heed of what passed around her. Her husband was  in an excellent temper; he played the part of host to perfection; and  when the two officers were established comfortably by the fire, in the  captain's room, smoking together, they could not but do justice to his  courteous manners.    \"He appears to be a man of general information,\" remarked Edward.    \"He has traveled a great deal, and read a great deal, as I told you  when we first met: he is a remarkable man, but one of uncontrolled  passions, and desperately jealous.\"    \"Yet he appears very attentive to his wife.\"    \"Undoubtedly he is wildly in love with her; yet he makes her unhappy,  and himself too.\"    \"He certainly does not appear happy, there is so much restlessness.\"    \"He can never bear to remain in one place for any length of time  together. He is now going to sell the property he only bought last  year. There is an instability about him; everything palls on him.\"    \"That is the complaint of many who are rich and well to do in the  world.\"    \"Yes; only not in the same degree. I assure you it has often struck me  that man must have a bad conscience.\"    \"What an idea!\" rejoined Edward, with a forced laugh, for the  captain's remark struck him forcibly. \"He seems a man of honor.\"    \"Oh, one may be a man of honor, as it is called, and yet have  something quite bad enough to reproach yourself with. But I know  nothing about it, and would not breathe such a thing except to you.  His wife, too, looks so pale and so oppressed.\"    \"But, perhaps, that is her natural complexion and expression.\"    \"Oh, no! no! the year before D'Effernay came from Paris, she was as  fresh as a rose. Many people declare that your poor friend loved her.  The affair was wrapped in mystery, and I never believed the report,  for Hallberg was a steady man, and the whole country knew that Emily  had been engaged a long time.\"    \"Hallberg never mentioned the name in his letters,\" answered Edward,  with less candor than usual.    \"I thought not. Besides D'Effernay was very much attached to him, and  mourned his death.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"I assure you the morning that Hallberg was found dead in his bed so  unexpectedly, D'Effernay was like one beside himself.\"    \"Very extraordinary. But as we are on the subject, tell me, I pray  you, all the circumstances of my poor "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13821"],[0,"Tales of Wonder (#16)"],[1,"night, so he too did eighty-four knots a day.  It was a pretty race. I have not troubled to see if Shard added up his  figures wrongly or if he under-rated the pace of camels, but whatever  it was the Arabs gained slightly, for on the fourth day Spanish Jack,  five knots astern on what they called the cutter, sighted the camels a  very long way off and signalled the fact to Shard. They had left their  cavalry behind as Shard supposed they would. The wind held good, they  had still two oxen left and could always eat their \"cutter\", and they  had a fair, though not ample, supply of water, but the appearance of  the Arabs was a blow to Shard for it showed him that there was no  getting away from them, and of all things he dreaded guns. He made  light of it to the men: said they would sink the lot before they had  been in action half an hour: yet he feared that once the guns came up  it was only a question of time before his rigging was cut or his  steering gear disabled.    One point the Desperate Lark scored over the Arabs and a very good one  too, darkness fell just before they could have sighted her and now  Shard used the lantern ahead as he dared not do on the first night  when the Arabs were close, and with the help of it managed to do three  knots. The Arabs encamped in the evening and the Desperate Lark gained  twenty knots. But the next evening they appeared again and this time  they saw the sails of the Desperate Lark.    On the sixth day they were close. On the seventh they were closer. And  then, a line of verdure across their bows, Shard saw the Niger River.    Whether he knew that for a thousand miles it rolled its course through  forest, whether he even knew that it was there at all; what his plans  were, or whether he lived from day to day like a man whose days are  numbered he never told his men. Nor can I get an indication on this  point from the talk that I hear from sailors in their cups in a  certain tavern I know of. His face was expressionless, his mouth shut,  and he held his ship to her course. That evening they were up to the  edge of the tree trunks and the Arabs camped and waited ten knots  astern and the wind had sunk a little.    There Shard anchored a little before sunset and landed at once. At  first he explored the forest a little on foot. Then he sent for  Spanish Dick. They had slung the cutter on board some days ago when  they found she could not keep up. Shard could not ride but he sent for  Spanish Dick and told him he must take him as a passenger. So Spanish  Dick slung him in front of the saddle \"before the mast\" as Shard  called it, for they still carried a mast on the front of the saddle,  and away they galloped together. \"Rough weather,\" said Shard, but he  surveyed the forest as he went and the long and short of it was he  found a place where the forest was less than half a mile thick and the  Desperate Lark might get through: but twenty trees must be cut. Shard  marked the trees himself, sent Spanish Dick right back to watch the  Arabs and turned the whole of his crew on to those twenty trees. It  was a frightful risk, the Desperate Lark was empty, with an enemy no  more than ten knots astern, but it was a moment for bold measures and  Shard took the chance of being left without his ship in the heart of  Africa in the hope of being repaid by escaping altogether.    The men worked all night on those twenty trees, those that had no axes  bored with bradawls and blasted, and then relieved those that had.    Shard was indefatigable, he went from tree to tree showing exactly  what way every one was to fall, and what was to be done with them when  they were down. Some had to be cut down because their branches would  get in the way of the masts, others because their trunks would be in  the way of the wheels; in the case of the last the stumps had to be  made smooth and low with saws and perhaps a bit of the trunk sawn off  and rolled away. This was the hardest work they had. And they were all  large trees, on the other hand had they been small there would have  been many more of them and they could not have sailed in and out,  sometimes for hundreds of yards, without cutting any at all: and all  this Shard calculated on doing if only there was time.    The light before dawn came and it looked as if they would never do it  at all. And then dawn came and it was all done but one tree, the hard  part of the work had all been done in the night and a sort of final  rush cleared everything up except that one huge tree. And then the  cutter signalled the Arabs were moving. At dawn they had prayed, and  now they had struck their camp. Shard at once ordered all his men to  the ship except ten whom he left at the tree, they had some way to go  and the Arabs had been moving some ten minutes before they got there.  Shard took in the cutter which wasted five minutes, hoisted sail  short-handed and that took five minutes more, and slowly got under  way.    The wind was dropping still and by the time the Desperate Lark had  come to the edge of that part of the forest through which Shard had  laid his course the Arabs were no more than five knots away. He had  sailed East half a mile, which he ought to have done overnight so as  to be ready, but he could not spare time or thought or men away from  those twenty trees. Then Shard turned into the forest and the Arabs  were dead astern. They hurried when they saw the Desperate Lark enter  the forest.    \"Doing ten knots,\" said Shard as he watched them from the deck. The  Desperate Lark was doing no more than a knot and a half for the wind  was weak under the lee of the trees. Yet all went well for a while.  The big tree had just come down some way ahead, and the ten men were  sawing bits off the trunk.    And then Shard saw a branch that he had not marked on the chart, it  would just catch the top of the mainmast. He anchored at once and sent  a hand aloft who sawed it half way through and did the rest with a  pistol, and now the Arabs were only three knots astern. For a quarter  of a mile Shard steered them through the forest till they came to the  ten men and that bad big tree, another foot had yet to come off one  corner of the stump for the wheels had to pass over it. Shard turned  all hands on to the stump and it was then that the Arabs came within  shot. But they had to unpack their gun. And before they had it mounted  Shard was away. If they had charged things might have been different.  When they saw the Desperate Lark under way again the Arabs came on to  within three hundred yards and there they mounted two guns. Shard  watched them along his stern gun but would not fire. They were six  hundred yards away before the Arabs could fire and then they fired too  soon and both guns missed. And Shard and his merry men saw clear water  only ten fathoms ahead. Then Shard loaded his stern gun with canister  instead of shot and at the same moment the Arabs charged on their  camels; they came galloping down through the forest waving long  lances. Shard left the steering to Smerdrak and stood by the stern  gun, the Arabs were within fifty yards and still Shard did not fire;  he had most of his men in the stern with muskets beside him. Those  lances carried on camels were altogether different from swords in the  hands of horsemen, they could reach the men on deck. The men could see  the horrible barbs on the lanceheads, they were almost at their faces  when Shard fired, and at the same moment the Desperate Lark with her  dry and suncracked keel in air on the high bank of the Niger fell  forward like a diver. The gun went off through the tree-tops, a wave  came over the bows and swept the stern, the Desperate Lark wriggled  and righted herself, she was back in her element.    The merry men looked at the wet decks and at their dripping  clothes. \"Water,\" they said almost wonderingly.    The Arabs followed a little way through the forest but when they saw  that they had to face a broadside instead of one stern gun and  perceived that a ship afloat is less vulnerable to cavalry even than  when on shore, they abandoned ideas of revenge, and comforted  themselves with a text out of their sacred book which tells how in  other days and other places our enemies shall suffer even as we  desire.    For a thousand miles with the flow of the Niger and the help of  occasional winds, the Desperate Lark moved seawards. At first he  sweeps East a little and then Southwards, till you come to Akassa and  the open sea.    I will not tell you how they caught fish and ducks, raided a village  here and there and at last came to Akassa, for I have said much  already of Captain Shard. Imagine them drawing nearer and nearer the  sea, bad men all, and yet with a feeling for something where we feel  for our king, our country or our home, a feeling for something that  burned in them not less ardently than our feelings in us, and that  something the sea. Imagine them nearing it till sea birds appeared and  they fancied they felt sea breezes and all sang songs again that they  had not sung for weeks. Imagine them heaving at last on the salt  Atlantic again.    I have said much already of Captain Shard and I fear lest I shall  weary you, O my reader, if I tell you any more of so bad a man. I too  at the top of a tower all alone am weary.    And yet it is right that such a tale should be told. A journey almost  due South from near Algiers to Akassa in a ship that we should call no  more than a yacht. Let it be a stimulus to younger men.                             Guarantee To The Reader    Since writing down for your benefit, O my reader, all this long tale  that I heard in the tavern by the sea I have travelled in Algeria and  Tunisia as well as in the Desert. Much that I saw in those countries  seems to throw doubt on the tale that the sailor told me. To begin  with the Desert does not come within hundreds of miles of the coast  and there are more mountains to cross than you"]]]
