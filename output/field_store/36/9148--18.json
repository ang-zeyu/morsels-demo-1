Not only do they, as  already shown, differ in rank, but they hold _levees_ and audiences  and may be promoted for distinguished services, just as the Chinese  officials are. They \"may rise from an humble position to one near the  Pearly Emperor, who gives them the reward of merit for ruling well the  affairs of men. The correlative deities of the mandarins are only of  equal rank, yet the fact that they have been apotheosized makes them  their superiors and fit objects of worship. Chinese mandarins rotate in  office, generally every three years, and then there is a corresponding  change in Hades. The image in the temple remains the same, but the  spirit which dwells in the clay tabernacle changes, so the idol has  a different name, birthday, and tenant. The priests are informed by  the Great Wizard of the Dragon Tiger Mountain, but how can the people  know gods which are not the same to-day as yesterday?\" (Pp. 360-361.)    The gods also indulge in amusements, marry, sin, are punished, die,  are resurrected, or die and are transformed, or die finally. [12]      The Three Religions    We have in China the universal worship of ancestors, which constitutes  (or did until A.D. 1912) the State religion, usually known as  Confucianism, and in addition we have the gods of the specific  religions (which also originally took their rise in ancestor-worship),  namely, Buddhism and Taoism. (Other religions, though tolerated,  are not recognized as Chinese religions.) It is with a brief account  of this great hierarchy and its mythology that we will now concern  ourselves.    Besides the ordinary ancestor-worship (as distinct from the State  worship) the people took to Buddhism and Taoism, which became  the popular religions, and the _literati_ also honoured the gods  of these two sects. Buddhist deities gradually became installed in  Taoist temples, and the Taoist immortals were given seats beside the  Buddhas in their sanctuaries. Every one patronized the god who seemed  to him the most popular and the most lucrative. There even came to  be united in the same temple and worshipped at the same altar the  three religious founders or figure-heads, Confucius, Buddha, and Lao  Tzu. The three religions were even regarded as forming one whole,  or at least, though different, as having one and the same object:  _san erh i yeh_, or _han san wei i_, \"the three are one,\" or \"the  three unite to form one\" (a quotation from the phrase _T'ai chi han  san wei i_ of Fang Yue-lu: \"When they reach the extreme the three are  seen to be one\"). In the popular pictorial representations of the  pantheon this impartiality is clearly shown.      The Super-triad    The toleration, fraternity, or co-mixture of the three  religions--ancestor-worship or Confucianism, Chinese Buddhism,  and Taoism--explains the compound nature of the triune head of  the Chinese pantheon. The numerous deities of Buddhism and Taoism  culminate each in a triad of gods (the Three Precious Ones and the  Three Pure Ones respectively), but the three religions jointly have  also a triad compounded of one representative member of each. This  general or super-triad is, of course, composed of Confucius, Lao Tzu,  and Buddha. This is the officially decreed order, though it is varied  occasionally by Buddha being placed in the centre (the place of honour)  as an act of ceremonial deference shown to a 'stranger' or 'guest'  from another country.      Worship of the Living    Before proceeding to consider the gods of China in detail, it is  necessary to note that ancestor-worship, which, as before stated,  is worship of the ghosts of deceased persons, who are usually but  not invariably relatives of the worshipper, has at times a sort of  preliminary stage in this world consisting of the worship of living  beings. Emperors, viceroys, popular officials, or people beloved for  their good deeds have had altars, temples, and images erected to them,  where they are worshipped in the same way as those who have already  \"shuffled off this mortal coil.\" The most usual cases are perhaps those  of the worship of living emperors and those in which some high official  who has gained the gratitude of the people is transferred to another  post. The explanation is simple. The second self which exists after  death is identical with the second self inhabiting the body during  life. Therefore it may be propitiated or gratified by sacrifices  of food, drink, etc., or theatricals performed in its honour, and  continue its protection and good offices even though now far away.        Confucianism    Confucianism (_Ju Chiao_) is said to be the religion of the learned,  and the learned were the officials and the _literati_ or lettered  class, which includes scholars waiting for posts, those who have failed  to get posts (or, though qualified, prefer to live in retirement), and  those who have retired from posts. Of this 'religion' it has been said:    \"The name embraces education, letters, ethics, and political  philosophy. Its head was not a religious man, practised few religious  rites, and taught nothing about religion. In its usual acceptation the  term Confucianist means 'a gentleman and a scholar'; he may worship  only once a year, yet he belongs to the Church. Unlike its two sisters,  it has no priesthood, and fundamentally is not a religion at all;  yet with the many rites grafted on the original tree it becomes a  religion, and the one most difficult to deal with. Considered as a  Church, the classics are its scriptures, the schools its churches, the  teachers its priests, ethics its theology, and the written character,  so sacred, its symbol.\" [13]      Confucius not a God    It should be noted that Confucius himself is not a god, though he  has been and is worshipped (66,000 animals used to be offered to him  every year; probably the number is about the same now). Suggestions  have been made to make him the God of China and Confucianism the  religion of China, so that he and his religion would hold the same  relative positions that Christ and Christianity do in the West. I  was present at the lengthy debate which took place on this subject  in the Chinese Parliament in February 1917, but in spite of many  long, learned, and eloquent speeches, chiefly by scholars of the  old school, the motion was not carried. Nevertheless, the worship  accorded to Confucius was and is (except by 'new' or 'young' China)  of so extreme a nature that he may almost be described as the great  unapotheosized god of China. [14] Some of his portraits even ascribe to  him superhuman attributes. But in spite of all this the fact remains  that Confucius has not been appointed a god and holds no _exequatur_  entitling him to that rank.    If we inquire into the reason of this we find that, astonishing  though it may seem, Confucius is classed by the Chinese not as a god  (_shen_), but as a demon (_kuei_). A short historical statement will  make the matter clear.    In the classical _Li chi, Book of Ceremonial_, we find the categorical  assignment of the worship of certain objects to certain subjective  beings: the emperor worshipped Heaven and earth, the feudal princes the  mountains and rivers, the officials the hearth, and the _literati_  their ancestors. Heaven, earth, mountains, rivers, and hearth  were called _shen_ (gods), and ancestors _kuei_ (demons). This  distinction is due to Heaven being regarded as the god and the  people as demons--the upper is the god, the lower the evil spirit or  demon. Though _kuei_ were usually bad, the term in Chinese includes  both good and evil spirits. In ancient times those who had by their  meritorious virtue while in the world averted calamities from the  people were posthumously worshipped and called gods, but those who were  worshipped by their descendants only were called spirits or demons.    In the worship of Confucius by emperors of various dynasties (details  of which need not be given here) the highest titles conferred on him  were _Hsien Sheng_, 'Former or Ancestral Saint,' and even _Win Hsuean  Wang_, 'Accomplished and Illustrious Prince,' and others containing  like epithets. When for his image or idol there was (in the eleventh  year--A.D. 1307--of the reign-period Ta Te of the Emperor Ch'eng  Tsung of the Yuean dynasty) substituted the tablet now seen in the  Confucian temples, these were the inscriptions engraved on it. In the  inscriptions authoritatively placed on the tablets the word _shen_  does not occur; in those cases where it does occur it has been  placed there (as by the Taoists) illegally and without authority  by too ardent devotees. Confucius may not be called a _shen_, since  there is no record showing that the great ethical teacher was ever  apotheosized, or that any order was given that the character _shen_  was to be applied to him.      The God of Literature    In addition to the ancestors of whose worship it really consists,  Confucianism has in its pantheon the specialized gods worshipped by  the _literati_. Naturally the chief of these is Wen Ch'ang, the God of  Literature. The account of him (which varies in several particulars  in different Chinese works) relates that he was a man of the name  of Chang Ya, who was born during the T'ang dynasty in the kingdom of  Yueeh (modern Chekiang), and went to live at Tzu T'ung in Ssuch'uan,  where his intelligence raised him to the position of President of the  Board of Ceremonies. Another account refers to him as Chang Ya Tzu,  the Soul or Spirit of Tzu T'ung, and states that he held office in the  Chin dynasty (A.D. 265-316), and was killed in a fight. Another again  states that under the Sung dynasty (A.D. 960-1280), in the third year  (A.D. 1000) of the reign-period Hsien P'ing of the Emperor Chen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#16)"],[1,"the result of the attempt made by the First Emperor  about 200 B.C. to destroy the classical literature and to its subsequent  laborious restoration. At a time when the Indians regarded the Veda as a  verbal revelation, certain and divine in every syllable, the Chinese  were painfully recovering and re-piecing their ancient chronicles and  poems from imperfect manuscripts and fallible memories. The process  obliged them to enquire at every step whether the texts which they  examined were genuine and complete: to admit that they might be  defective or paraphrases of a difficult original. Hence the Chinese have  sound principles of criticism unknown to the Hindus and in discussing  the date of an ancient work or the probability of an alleged historical  event they generally use arguments which a European scholar can accept.    Chinese literature has a strong ethical and political flavour which  tempered the extravagance of imported Indian ideas. Most Chinese systems  assert more or less plainly that right conduct is conduct in harmony  with the laws of the State and the Universe.      18. _Morality and Will_    It is dangerous to make sweeping statements about the huge mass of  Indian literature, but I think that most Buddhist and Brahmanic systems  assume that morality is merely a means of obtaining happiness[67] and is  not obedience to a categorical imperative or to the will of God.  Morality is by inference raised to the status of a cosmic law, because  evil deeds will infallibly bring evil consequences to the doer in this  life or in another. But it is not commonly spoken of as such a law. The  usual point of view is that man desires happiness and for this morality  is a necessary though insufficient preparation. But there may be higher  states which cannot be expressed in terms of happiness.    The will receives more attention in European philosophy than in Indian,  whether Buddhist or Brahmanic, which both regard it not as a separate  kind of activity but as a form of thought. As such it is not neglected  in Buddhist psychology: will, desire and struggle are recognized as good  provided their object is good, a point overlooked by those who accuse  Buddhism of preaching inaction[68].    Schopenhauer's doctrine that will is the essential fact in the universe  and in life may appear to have analogies to Indian thought: it would be  easy for instance to quote passages from the Pitakas showing that  _tanha_, thirst, craving or desire, is the force which makes and remakes  the world. But such statements must be taken as generalizations  respecting the world as it is rather than as implying theories of its  origin, for though _tanha_ is a link in the chain of causation, it is  not regarded as an ultimate principle more than any other link but is  made to depend on feeling. The Maya of the Vedanta is not so much the  affirmation of the will to live as the illusion that we have a real  existence apart from Brahman, and the same may be said of Ahamkara in  the Sankhya philosophy. It is the principle of egoism and individuality,  but its essence is not so much self-assertion as the _mistaken_ idea  that this is _mine_, that _I_ am happy or unhappy.    There is a question much debated in European philosophy but little  argued in India, namely the freedom of the will. The active European  feeling the obligation and the difficulties of morality is perplexed by  the doubt whether he really has the power to act as he wishes. This  problem has not much troubled the Hindus and rightly, as I think. For if  the human will is not free, what does freedom mean? What example of  freedom can be quoted with which to contrast the supposed non-freedom of  the will? If in fact it is from the will that our notion of freedom is  derived, is it not unreasonable to say that the will is not free?  Absolute freedom in the sense of something regulated by no laws is  unthinkable. When a thing is conditioned by external causes it is  dependent. When it is conditioned by internal causes which are part of  its own nature, it is free. No other freedom is known. An Indian would  say that a man's nature is limited by Karma. Some minds are incapable of  the higher forms of virtue and wisdom, just as some bodies are incapable  of athletic feats. But within the limits of his own nature a human being  is free. Indian theology is not much hampered by the mad doctrine that  God has predestined some souls to damnation, nor by the idea of Fate,  except in so far as Karma is Fate. It is Fate in the sense that Karma  inherited from a previous birth is a store of rewards and punishments  which must be enjoyed or endured, but it differs from Fate because we  are all the time making our own karma and determining the character of  our next birth.    The older Upanishads hint at a doctrine analogous to that of Kant,  namely that man is bound and conditioned in so far as he is a part of  the world of phenomena but free in so far as the self within him is  identical with the divine self which is the creator of all bonds and  conditions. Thus the Kaushitaki Upanishad says, \"He it is who causes the  man whom he will lead upwards from these worlds to do good works and He  it is who causes the man whom he will lead downwards to do evil works.  He is the guardian of the world, He is the ruler of the world, He is the  Lord of the world and He is myself.\" Here the last words destroy the  apparent determinism of the first part of the sentence. And similarly  the Chandogya Upanishad says, \"They who depart hence without having  known the Self and those true desires, for them there is no freedom in  all worlds. But they who depart hence after knowing the Self and those  true desires, for them there is freedom in all worlds[70].\"    Early Buddhist literature asserts uncompromisingly that every state of  consciousness has a cause and in one of his earliest discourses the  Buddha argues that the Skandhas, including mental states, cannot be the  Self because we have not free will to make them exactly what we  choose[71]. But throughout his ethical teaching it is I think assumed  that, subject to the law of karma, conscious action is equivalent to  spontaneous action. Good mental states can be made to grow and bad  mental states to decrease until the stage is reached when the saint  knows that he is free. It may perhaps be thought that the early  Buddhists did not realize the consequences of applying their doctrine of  causation to psychology and hence never faced the possibility of  determinism. But determinism, fatalism, and the uselessness of effort  formed part of the paradoxical teaching of Makkhali Gosala reported in  the Pitakas and therefore well known. If neither the Jains nor the  Buddhists allowed themselves to be embarrassed by such denials of free  will, the inference is that in some matters at least the Hindus had  strong common sense and declined to accept any view which takes away  from man the responsibility and lordship of his own soul.      19. _The Origin of Evil_    The reader will have gathered from what precedes that Hinduism has  little room for the Devil[72]. Buddhism being essentially an ethical  system recognizes the importance of the Tempter or Mara, but still Mara  is not an evil spirit who has spoilt a good world. In Hinduism, whether  pantheistic or polytheistic, there is even less disposition to personify  evil in one figure, and most Indian religious systems are disposed to  think of the imperfections of the world as suffering rather than as sin.    Yet the existence of evil is the chief reason for the existence of  religion, at least of such religions as promise salvation, and the  explanation of evil is the chief problem of all religions and  philosophies, and the problem which they all alike are conspicuously  unsuccessful in solving. I can assign no reason for rejecting as  untenable the idea that the ultimate reality may be a duality--a good and  an evil spirit--or even a plurality[73], but still it is unthinkable for  me and I believe for most minds. If there are two ultimate beings,  either they must be complementary and necessary one to the other, in  which case it seems to me more correct to describe them as two aspects  of one being, or if they are quite separate, my mind postulates (but I  do not know why) a third being who is the cause of them both.    The problem of evil is not quite the same for Indian and European  pantheists. The European pantheist holds that since God is all things or  in all things, evil is only something viewed out of due perspective:  that the world would be seen to be perfect, if it could be seen as a  whole, or that evil will be eliminated in the course of development. But  he cannot explain why the partial view of the world which human beings  are obliged to take shows the existence of obvious evil. The Hindus  think that it is possible and better for the soul to leave the vain show  of the world and find peace in union with God. They are therefore not  concerned to prove that the world is good, although they cannot explain  why God allows it to exist. The Upanishads contain some myths and  parables about the introduction of evil but they do not say that a  naturally good world was spoilt[74]. They rather imply that increasing  complexity involves the increase of evil as well as of good. This is  also the ground thought of the Agganna Sutta, the Buddhist Genesis (Dig.  Nik. XXVII.).    I think that the substance of much Indian pantheism--late Buddhist as  well as Brahmanic--is that the world, the soul and God (the three terms  being practically the same) have two modes of existence: one of repose  and bliss, the other of struggle and trouble. Of these the first mode is  the better and it is only by mistake[75] that the eternal spirit adopts  the latter. But both the mistake and the correction of it are being  eternally repeated. Such a formulation of the Advaita philosophy would  no doubt be regarded"]]]
