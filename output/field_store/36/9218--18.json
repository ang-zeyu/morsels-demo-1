[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#16)"],[1,"while Dane placed before him a mug of stimulating caf-hag.    \"I don't get it!\" The Medic addressed the table top rather than the  amateur cook. \"It's a poison of some kind. Kosti went dirt-side--Mura  didn't. Yet Mura came down with it first. And we didn't ship any food  from Sargol. Neither did he eat any while we were there. Unless he did  and we didn't know about it. If I could just bring him to long enough to  answer a couple of questions!\" Sighing he dropped his weary head on his  folded arms and within seconds was asleep.    Dane put the mug back on the heating unit and sat down at the other end  of the table. He did not have the heart to shake Tau into  wakefulness--let the poor devil get a slice of bunk time, he certainly  needed it after the fatigues of the past four days.    Van Rycke passed along the corridor on his way to the hydro, Sinbad at  his heels. But in a moment the cat was back, leaping up on Dane's knee.  He did not curl up, but rubbed against the young man's arm, finally  reaching up with a paw to touch Dane's chin, uttering one of the  soundless, mews which were his bid for attention.    \"What's the matter, boy?\" Dane fondled the cat's ears. \"You haven't got  a headache--have you?\" In that second a wild surmise came into his mind.  Sinbad had been planet-side on Sargol as much as he could, and on ship  board he was equally at home in all their cabins--could he be the carrier  of the disease?    A good idea--only if it were true, then logically the second victim  should have been Van, or Dane--whereas Sinbad lingered most of the time  in their cabins--not Kosti. The cat, as far as he knew, had never shown  any particular fondness for the jetman and certainly did not sleep in  Karl's quarters. No--that point did not fit. But he would mention it to  Tau--no use overlooking anything--no matter how wild.    It was the sequence of victims which puzzled them all. As far as Tau had  been able to discover Mura and Kosti had nothing much in common except  that they were crewmates on the same spacer. They did not bunk in the  same section, their fields of labor were totally different, they had no  special food or drink tastes in common, they were not even of the same  race. Frank Mura was one of the few descendants of a mysterious (or now  mysterious) people who had had their home on a series of islands in one  of Terra's seas, islands which almost a hundred years before had been  swallowed up in a series of world-rending quakes--Japan was the ancient  name of that nation. While Karl Kosti had come from the once thickly  populated land masses half the planet away which had borne the  geographical name of \"Europe.\" No, all the way along the two victims had  only very general meeting points--they both shipped on the Solar Queen  and they were both of Terran birth.    Tau stirred and sat up, blinking bemusedly at Dane, then pushed back his  wiry black hair and assumed a measure of alertness. Dane dropped the now  purring cat in the Medic's lap and in a few sentences outlined his  suspicion. Tau's hands closed about Sinbad.    \"There's a chance in that--\" He looked a little less beat and he drank  thirstily from the mug Dane gave him for the second time. Then he hurried  out with Sinbad under one arm--bound for his lab.    Dane slicked up the galley, trying to put things away as neatly as Mura  kept them. He didn't have much faith in the Sinbad lead, but in this case  everything must be checked out.    When the Medic did not appear during the rest of the ship's day Dane was  not greatly concerned. But he was alerted to trouble when Ali came in  with an inquiry and a complaint.    \"Seen anything of Craig?\"    \"He's in the lab,\" Dane answered.    \"He didn't answer my knock,\" Ali protested. \"And Weeks says he hasn't  been in to see Karl all day--\"    That did catch Dane's attention. Had his half hunch been right? Was Tau  on the trail of a discovery which had kept him chained to the lab? But it  wasn't like the Medic not to look in on his patients.    \"You're sure he isn't in the lab?\"    \"I told you that he didn't answer my knock. I didn't open the panel--\"  But now Ali was already in the corridor heading back the way he had come,  with Dane on his heels, an unwelcome explanation for that silence in both  their minds. And their fears were reinforced by what they heard as they  approached the panel--a low moan wrung out of unbearable pain. Dane  thrust the sliding door open.    Tau had slipped from his stool to the floor. His hands were at his head  which rolled from side to side as if he were trying to quiet some agony.  Dane stripped down the Medic's under tunic. There was no need to make a  careful examination, in the hollow of Craig Tau's throat was the  tell-tale red blotch.    \"Sinbad!\" Dane glanced about the cabin. \"Did Sinbad get out past you?\" he  demanded of the puzzled Ali.    \"No--I haven't seen him all day--\"    Yet the cat was nowhere in the tiny cabin and it had no concealed hiding  place. To make doubly sure Dane secured the panel before they carried Tau  to his bunk. The Medic had blacked out again, passed into the lethargic  second stage of the malady. At least he was out of the pain which  appeared to be the worst symptom of the disease.    \"It must be Sinbad!\" Dane said as he made his report directly to Captain  Jellico. \"And yet--\"    \"Yes, he's been staying in Van's cabin,\" the Captain mused. \"And you've  handled him, he slept on your bunk. Yet you and Van are all right. I  don't understand that. Anyway--to be on the safe side--we'd better find  and isolate him before--\"    He didn't have to underline any words for the grim-faced men who  listened. With Tau--their one hope of fighting the disease gone--they had  a black future facing them.    They did not have to search for Sinbad. Dane coming down to his own  section found the cat crouched before the panel of Van Rycke's cabin, his  eyes glued to the thin crack of the door. Dane scooped him up and took  him to the small cargo space intended for the safeguarding of choice  items of commerce. To his vast surprise Sinbad began fighting wildly as  he opened the hatch, kicking and then slashing with ready claws. The cat  seemed to go mad and Dane had all he could do to shut him in. When he  snapped the panel he heard Sinbad launch himself against the barrier as  if to batter his way out. Dane, blood welling in several deep scratches,  went in search of first aid. But some suspicion led him to pause as he  passed Van Rycke's door. And when his knock brought no answer he pushed  the panel open.    Van Rycke lay on his bunk, his eyes half closed in a way which had become  only too familiar to the crew of the Solar Queen. And Dane knew that when  he looked for it he would find the mark of the strange plague on the  Cargo-master's body.          Chapter IX    PLAGUE!      Jellico and Steen Wilcox pored over the few notes Tau had made before he  was stricken. But apparently the Medic had found nothing to indicate that  Sinbad was the carrier of any disease. Meanwhile the Captain gave orders  for the cat to be confined. A difficult task--since Sinbad crouched close  to the door of the storage cabin and was ready to dart out when food was  taken in for him. Once he got a good way down the corridor before Dane  was able to corner and return him to keeping.    Dane, Ali and Weeks took on the full care of the four sick men, leaving  the few regular duties of the ship to the senior officers, while Rip was  installed in charge of the hydro garden.    Mura, the first to be taken ill, showed no change. He was semi-conscious,  he swallowed food if it were put in his mouth, he responded to nothing  around him. And Kosti, Tau, and Van Rycke followed the same pattern.  They still held morning inspection of those on their feet for signs of a  new outbreak, but when no one else went down during the next two days,  they regained a faint spark of hope.    Hope which was snapped out when Ali brought the news that Stotz could not  be roused and must have taken ill during a sleep period. One more inert  patient was added to the list--and nothing learned about how he was  infected. Except that they could eliminate Sinbad, since the cat had been  in custody during the time Stotz had apparently contracted the disease.    Weeks, Ali and Dane, though they were in constant contact with the sick  men, and though Dane had repeatedly handled Sinbad, continued to be  immune. A fact, Dane thought more than once, which must have  significance--if someone with Tau's medical knowledge had been able to  study it. By all rights they should be the most susceptible--but the  opposite seemed true. And Wilcox duly noted that fact among the data they  had recorded.    It became a matter of watching each other, waiting for another collapse.  And they were not surprised when Tang Ya reeled into the mess, his face  livid and drawn with pain. Rip and Dane got him to his cabin before he  blacked out. But all they could learn from him during the interval before  he lost consciousness was that his head was bursting and he couldn't  stand it. Over his limp body they stared at one another bleakly.    \"Six down,\" Ali observed, \"and six to go. How do you feel?\"    \"Tired, that's all. What I don't understand is that once they go into  this stupor they just stay. They don't get any worse, they have no rise  in temperature--it's as if they are in a modified form of cold sleep!\"    \"How is Tang?\" Rip asked from the corridor.    \"Usual pattern,\" Ali answered, \"He's sleeping. Got a pain, Fella?\"    Rip shook his head. \"Right as a Com-unit. I don't get it. Why does it  strike Tang who didn't even hit dirt much--and yet you keep on--?\"    Dane grimaced. \"If we had an answer to that, maybe we'd know what caused  the whole thing--\"    Ali's eyes narrowed. He was staring straight at the unconscious Com-tech  as if he did not see that supine body at all. \"I wonder if we've been  salted--\" he said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#16)"],[1,"of battle. Yours are  the swords and the courage; you must leave it to me to plan the  campaign, and to direct your valour. The culprits were but few, and  only two are to be punished; the rest of you must blot out all memory  of that discreditable night. No army must ever hear again such words  spoken against the senate. It is the brain of the empire and the glory  of all the provinces. Why, in Heaven's name, the very Germans  themselves, whom Vitellius is stirring up with all his might against  us, would not dare to call its members into question! Shall it be said  that Italy's own sons, the real soldiery of Rome, are clamouring to  murder and massacre the very senators whose lustre it is that throws  into the shade the obscure and vulgar adherents of Vitellius?  Vitellius has seized a few provinces and raised a sort of shadow of an  army; but the senate is on our side. Therefore, Rome is for us; they  are against her. Do you imagine that the stability of this beautiful  city consists in houses and edifices built of stone upon stone? Nay,  they are dumb inanimate things that may fall to pieces and be rebuilt  at pleasure. The eternity of our empire, the peace of the world, your  welfare and mine, all depend upon the safety of the senate. Instituted  with solemn ceremony by the father and founder of Rome, the senate has  come down in undying continuity from the kings to the emperors; and as  we have received it from our ancestors, so let us hand it on to our  posterity. From your ranks come the senators, and from the senate come  the emperors of Rome.'    This speech, as being well calculated to provide a reprimand and a      85  sedative for the soldiers, and Otho's moderation--for he only ordered  the punishment of two men--were well received. He had calmed for a  moment the troops he could not control. Yet peace and quiet were not  restored in Rome. One could still detect the clash of arms and the  lurid face of war. Refraining from organized riot, the soldiers now  dispersed to private houses and lived in disguise, giving vent to  their bad feeling by maligning all whom nobility of birth or wealth or  any other distinction made a mark for scandal. Many, besides, believed  that some of Vitellius' soldiers had come to Rome to study the state  of party feeling. Everywhere suspicion was rife, and terror invaded  even the privacy of the home. But far greater was the alarm displayed  in public places. With every fresh piece of news that rumour brought,  men's feelings and the expression on their faces changed. They were  afraid to be found lacking in confidence when things looked doubtful,  or in joy when they went well for Otho. Above all, when the senate was  summoned to the House, they found it extraordinarily hard always to  strike the right note. Silence would argue arrogance; plain speaking  would arouse suspicion; yet flattery would be detected by Otho, who  had so lately been a private citizen, practising the art himself. So  they had to turn and twist their sentences. Vitellius they called  enemy and traitor, the more prudent confining themselves to such vague  generalities. A few ventured to fling the truth at him, but they  always chose a moment of uproar when a great many people were all  shouting at once, or else they talked so loud and fast as to drown  their own words.    Another cause of alarm was the various portents vouched for by          86  many witnesses. In the Capitoline Square, it was said, the figure of  Victory had let the reins of her chariot slip from her hands: a ghost  of superhuman size had suddenly burst out of the chapel of Juno:[182]  a statue of the sainted Julius on the island in the Tiber had, on a  fine, still day, turned round from the west and faced the east: an ox  had spoken in Etruria: animals had given birth to strange monsters.  Many were the stories of these occurrences, which in primitive ages  are observed even in time of peace, though now we only hear of them in  time of panic. But the greatest damage at the moment, and the greatest  alarm for the future, was caused by a sudden rising of the Tiber.  Immensely swollen, it carried away the bridge on piles,[183] and, its  current being stemmed by the heavy ruins, it flooded not only the  flat, low-lying portions of the city, but also districts that seemed  safe from inundation. Many people were swept away in the streets,  still more were overtaken by the flood in shops or in their beds at  home. The result was a famine, since food was scarce,[184] and the  poor were deprived of their means of livelihood. Blocks of flats, the  foundations of which had rotted in the standing water, collapsed when  the river sank. No sooner had the panic caused by the flood subsided  than it was found that, whereas Otho was preparing an expedition, its  route over the Martian Plain and up the Flaminian Road was blocked.  Though probably caused by chance, or the course of Nature, this mishap  was turned into a miraculous omen of impending disaster.    FOOTNOTES:        [152] Chap. 45.        [153] Cp. note 46.

[173] As the rest of this sentence refers to Spain and            Portugal it has been proposed to read for _Lingones Lusones_,            a Celtiberian tribe round the sources of the Tagus. The            Lingones were devoted to the cause of Vitellius. (See chap.            53, &c.)        [174] They had been thrown down by the populace, when Nero,            after divorcing Antonia, was shamed--or frightened--into            taking her back. (Cp. chap. 13.)        [175] They lived between the Dnieper and the Don, to the north            of the Sea of Azov.        [176] Gallica.        [177] This would depict him in full triumphal garb. But only            the emperor could actually hold a triumph, since it was under            his auspices that his generals fought.        [178] _Cohors civium Romanorum_. See note 130.        [179] The meaning of the title _praefectus legionis_ is            doubtful. It seems most likely to mean the same as _praefectus            castrorum_, an officer who superintended the camp and            sometimes acted as second-in-command (cp. ii. 89). The post            was one to which senior centurions could rise. At this period            they were not attached to a legion, but to a camp, where more            than one legion might be quartered. That makes the phrase here            used curious. The legion is that of the marines now stationed            in Rome (cp. chaps. 6 and 9). They appear to have joined the            mutinous Seventeenth cohort when they reached the city.        [180] About L40.        [181] The insignia of a tribunus were a tunic with a broad or            narrow stripe (accordingly as they were of senatorial or            equestrian rank), and a gold ring. A centurion carried a staff            made of a vine-branch, for disciplinary purposes.        [182] One of the three chapels in the temple of Jupiter on the            Capitoline.        [183] The pons Sublicius which led from the Velabrum to            Janiculum. It was the bridge which Horatius Cocles defended,            and a certain sanctity attached to it.        [184] Plutarch mentions that the quarter which suffered most            was that which contained the retail provision-shops.      OTHO'S PLANS    Otho had held a purification of the city[185] and meditated his         87  plans for the war. Recognizing that the Pennine and Cottian Alps and  all the other passes into Gaul were held by Vitellius, he decided to  invade Narbonese Gaul by sea. His fleet was now a strong and reliable  arm, devoted to his cause. For he had formed the full strength of a  legion out of the survivors of the Mulvian Bridge massacre,[186] whom  Galba's cruelty had kept in prison, and to all the marines he had  held out hopes of honourable service.[187] To the fleet he attached  the cohorts of the City Garrison and a large force of Guards. These  were the flower of the army and its chief strength, well able to  advise their own generals and to take good "]]]
