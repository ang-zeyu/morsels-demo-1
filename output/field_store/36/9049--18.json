And the purpose of the  prayer is not to persuade or influence God, but to join forces with Him  against the enemy. Not towards God, but with God against Satan--that is  the main thing to keep in mind in prayer. The real pitch is not Godward  but Satanward.    The second intense truth is this:--the winning quality in prayer is  _persistence_. The final test is here. This is the last ditch. Many who  fight well up to this point lose their grip here, and so lose all. Many  who are well equipped for prayer fail here, and doubtless fail because  they have not rightly understood. With clear, ringing tones the Master's  voice sounds in our ears again to-day, \"always to pray, _and_ not to  faint.\"        <u>A Stubborn Foe Routed.</u>      That is the parable teaching. Now a look at a plain out word from the  Master's lips. It is in the story of the demonized boy, the distressed  father, and the defeated disciples, at the foot of the transfiguration  mountain.[29] Extremes meet here surely. The mountain peak is in sharpest  contrast with the valley. The demon seems to be of the superlative degree.  His treatment of the possessed boy is malicious to an extreme. His purpose  is \"to destroy\" him. Yet there is a limit to his power, for what he would  do he has not yet been able to do. He shows extreme tenacity. He fought  bitterly against being disembodied again. (Can it be that embodiment eases  in some way the torture of existence for these prodigal spirits!) And so  far he fought well, and with success. The disciples had tried to cast him  out. They were expected to. They expected to. They had before. They  failed!--dismally--amid the sneering and jeering of the crowd and the  increasing distress of the poor father.    Then Jesus came. Was some of the transfiguring glory still lingering in  that great face? It would seem so. The crowd was \"amazed\" when they saw  Him, and \"saluted\" Him. His presence changed all. The demon angrily left,  doing his worst to wreck the house he had to vacate. The boy is restored;  and the crowd astonished at the power of God.    Then these disciples did a very keen thing. They made some bad blunders  but this is not one of them. They sought a private talk with Jesus. No  shrewder thing was ever done. When you fail, quit your service and get  away for a private interview with Jesus. With eyes big, and voices  dejected, the question wrung itself out of their sinking hearts, \"Why  could not _we_ cast it out?\" Matthew and Mark together supply the full  answer. Probably first came this:--\"because of your little faith.\" They  had quailed in their hearts before the power of this malicious demon. And  the demon knew it. They were more impressed with the power of the demon  than with the power of God. And the demon saw it. They had not prayed  victoriously against the demon. The Master says, \"faith only as big as a  mustard seed (you cannot measure the strength of the mustard seed by its  size) will say to this mountain--'Remove.'\" Mark keenly:--the direction of  the faith is towards the obstacle. Its force is against the enemy. It was  the demon who was most directly influenced by Jesus' faith.    Then comes the second part of the reply:--\"This kind can come out by  nothing but by prayer.\" Some less-stubborn demons may be cast out by the  faith that comes of our regular prayer-touch with God. This extreme sort  takes special prayer. This kind of a demon goes out by prayer. It can be  put out by nothing less. The real victory must be in the secret place. The  exercise of faith in the open battle is then a mere pressing of the  victory already won. These men had the language of Jesus on their lips,  but they had not gotten the victory first off somewhere alone. This demon  is determined not to go. He fights stubbornly and strongly. He succeeds.  Then this _Man of Prayer_ came. The quiet word of command is spoken. The  demon must go. These disciples were strikingly like some of us. They had  not _realized_ where the real victory is won. They had used the word of  command to the demon, doubtless coupling Jesus' name with it. But there  was not the secret touch with God that gives victory. Their eyes showed  their fear of the demon.    Prayer, real prayer, intelligent prayer, it is this that routs Satan's  demons, for it routs their chief. David killed the lion and bear in the  secret forests before he faced the giant in the open. These disciples were  facing the giant in the open without the discipline in secret. \"This kind  can be compelled to come out by nothing but by prayer,\" means this:--\"this  kind comes out, and must come out, before the man who prays.\" This thing  which Jesus calls prayer casts out demons. Would that we knew better by  experience what He meant by prayer. It exerts a positive influence upon  the hosts of evil spirits. They fear it. They fear the man who becomes  skilled in its use.    There are yet many other passages in this Bible fully as explicit as  these, and which give on the very surface just such plain teaching as  these. The very language of scripture throughout is full of this truth.  But these four great instances are quite sufficient to make the present  point clear and plain. This great renegade prince is an actual active  factor in the lives of men. He believes in the potency of prayer. He fears  it. He can hinder its results for a while. He does his best to hinder it,  and to hinder as long as possible.    _Prayer overcomes him._ It defeats his plans and himself. He cannot  successfully stand before it. He trembles when some man of simple faith in  God prays. Prayer is insistence upon God's will being done. It needs for  its practice a man in sympathetic touch with God. Its basis is Jesus'  victory. It overcomes the opposing will of the great traitor-leader.          III. How to Pray      1. The \"How\" of Relationship.  2. The \"How\" of Method.  3. The Listening Side of Prayer.  4. Something about God's Will in Connection with Prayer.  5. May We Pray with Assurance for the Conversion of Our Loved Ones?          The \"How\" of Relationship        <u>God's Ambassadors.</u>      If I had an ambition to be the ambassador of this country to our  mother-country, there would be two essential things involved. The first  and great essential would be to receive the appointment. I would need to  come into certain relation with our president, to possess certain  qualifications considered essential by him, and to secure from his hand  the appointment, and the official credentials of my appointment. That  would establish my relationship to the foreign court as the representative  of my own country, and my right to transact business in her name.    But having gotten that far I might go over there and make bad mistakes. I  might get our diplomatic relations tangled up, requiring many  explanations, and maybe apologies, and leaving unpleasant memories for a  long time to come. Such incidents have not been infrequent. Nations are  very sensitive. Governmental affairs must be handled with great nicety.  There would be a second thing which if I were a wise enough man to be an  ambassador I would likely do. I would go to see John Hay and Joseph H.  Choate, and have as many interviews with them as possible, and learn all I  possibly could from them of London official life, court etiquette,  personages to be dealt with, things to do, and things to avoid. How to be  a successful diplomat and further the good feeling between the two  governments, and win friends for our country among the sturdy Britons  would be my one absorbing thought. And having gotten all I could in that  way I would be constantly on the alert with all the mental keenness I  could command to practice being a successful ambassador.    The first of these would make me technically an ambassador. The second  would tend towards giving me some skill as an ambassador. Now there are  the same two how's in praying. First the relationship must be established  before any business can be transacted. Then skill must be acquired in the  transacting of the business on hand.    Just now, we want to talk about the first of these, the how of  relationship in prayer. The basis of prayer is right relationship with  God. Prayer is representing God in the spirit realm of this world. It is  insisting upon His rights down in this sphere of action. It is standing  for Him with full powers from Him. Clearly the only basis of such  relationship to God is _Jesus_. We have been outlawed by sin. We were in  touch with God. We broke with Him. The break could not be repaired by us.  Jesus came. He was God _and_ Man. He touches both. We get back through  Him, and only so. The blood of the cross is the basis of all prayer.  Through it the relationship is established that underlies all prayer. Only  as I come to God through Jesus to get the sin score straightened, and only  as I keep in sympathy with Jesus in the purpose of my life can I practice  prayer.        <u>Six Sweeping Statements.</u>      Jesus' own words make this very clear. There are two groups of teachings  on prayer in those three and a half years as given by the gospel records.  The first of these groups is in the Sermon on the Mount which Jesus  preached about half-way through the second year of His ministry. The  second group comes sheer at the end. All of it is in the last six months,  and most of it in the last ten days, and much of that on the very eve of  that last tragic day.    It is after the sharp rupture with the leaders that this second series of  statements is made. The most positive, and most sweeping utterances on  prayer are here. Of Jesus' eight promises regarding prayer six are here. I  want to ask you please to notice these six promises or statements; and  then, to notice their relation to our topic of to-day.    In Matthew 18:19, 20, is the first of these. \"Again I say unto you, that  if two of you shall agree on earth, as touching anything that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],[0,"\"Co. Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#16)"],[1,"time my father paid me a visit.  Rations were mighty scarce.  I was mighty glad to see him, but ashamed to let him know how poorly off  for something to eat we were.  We were living on parched corn.  I thought  of a happy plan to get him a good dinner, so I asked him to let us go up  to the colonel's tent.  Says I, \"Colonel Field, I desire to introduce you  to my father, and as rations are a little short in my mess, I thought you  might have a little better, and could give him a good dinner.\"  \"Yes,\"  says Colonel Field, \"I am glad to make the acquaintance of your father,  and will be glad to divide my rations with him.  Also, I would like you  to stay and take dinner with me,\" which I assure you, O kind reader,  I gladly accepted.  About this time a young African, Whit, came in with a  frying-pan of parched corn and dumped it on an old oil cloth, and said,  \"Master, dinner is ready.\"  That was all he had.  He was living like  ourselves--on parched corn.    We continued to fortify and build breastworks at Chattanooga.  It was  the same drudge, drudge day by day.  Occasionally a Sunday would come;  but when it did come, there came inspection of arms, knapsacks and  cartridge-boxes.  Every soldier had to have his gun rubbed up as bright  as a new silver dollar.  W. A. Hughes had the brightest gun in the army,  and always called it \"Florence Fleming.\"  The private soldier had to  have on clean clothes, and if he had lost any cartridges he was charged  twenty-five cents each, and had to stand extra duty for every cartridge  lost.  We always dreaded Sunday.  The roll was called more frequently on  this than any other day.  Sometimes we would have preaching.  I remember  one text that I thought the bottom had been knocked out long before:  \"And Peter's wife's mother lay sick of fever.\"  That text always did make  a deep impression on me.  I always thought of a young divine who preached  it when first entering the ministry, and in about twenty years came back,  and happening to preach from the same text again, an old fellow in  the congregation said, \"Mr. Preacher, ain't that old woman dead yet?\"  Well, that was the text that was preached to us soldiers one Sunday at  Chattanooga.  I could not help thinking all the time, \"Ain't that old  woman dead yet?\"  But he announced that he would preach again at 3  o'clock.  We went to hear him preach at 3 o'clock, as his sermon was  so interesting about \"Peter's wife's mother lay sick of a fever.\"  We  thought, maybe it was a sort of sickly subject, and he would liven us  up a little in the afternoon service.    Well, he took his text, drawled out through his nose like \"small  sweetness long drawn out:\" \"M-a-r-t-h-a, thou art w-e-a-r-i-e-d and  troubled about many things, but M-a-r-y hath chosen that good part that  shall never be taken from her.\"  Well, you see, O gentle and fair reader,  that I remember the text these long gone twenty years.  I do not remember  what he preached about, but I remember thinking that he was a great  ladies' man, at any rate, and whenever I see a man who loves and respects  the ladies, I think him a good man.    The next sermon was on the same sort of a text: \"And the Lord God caused  a deep sleep to fall on Adam and took out of\"--he stopped here and said  _e_ meant out of, that _e_, being translated from the Latin and Greek,  meant out of, and took _e_, or rather out of a rib and formed woman.  I never did know why he expaciated so largely on _e_; don't understand it  yet, but you see, reader mine, that I remember but the little things that  happened in that stormy epoch.  I remember the _e_ part of the sermon  more distinctly than all of his profound eruditions of theology, dogmas,  creeds and evidences of Christianity, and I only write at this time from  memory of things that happened twenty years ago.      \"OUT A LARKING\"    At this place, we took Walter Hood out \"a larking.\"  The way to go \"a  larking\" is this: Get an empty meal bag and about a dozen men and go to  some dark forest or open field on some cold, dark, frosty or rainy night,  about five miles from camp.  Get someone who does not understand the game  to hold the bag in as stooping and cramped a position as is possible,  to keep perfectly still and quiet, and when he has got in the right fix,  the others to go off to drive in the larks.  As soon as they get out of  sight, they break in a run and go back to camp, and go to sleep, leaving  the poor fellow all the time holding the bag.    Well, Walter was as good and as clever a fellow as you ever saw, was  popular with everybody, and as brave and noble a fellow as ever tore a  cartridge, or drew a ramrod, or pulled a trigger, but was the kind of a  boy that was easily \"roped in\" to fun or fight or anything that would  come up.  We all loved him.  Poor fellow, he is up yonder--died on the  field of glory and honor.  He gave his life, 'twas all he had, for his  country.  Peace to his memory.  That night we went \"a larking,\" and  Walter held the bag.  I did not see him till next morning.  While I was  gulping down my coffee, as well as laughter, Walter came around, looking  sort of sheepish and shy like, and I was trying to look as solemn as a  judge.  Finally he came up to the fire and kept on eyeing me out of one  corner of his eye, and I was afraid to look at him for fear of breaking  out in a laugh.  When I could hold in no longer, I laughed out, and said,  \"Well, Walter, what luck last night?\"  He was very much disgusted,  and said, \"Humph! you all think that you are smart.  I can't see anything  to laugh at in such foolishness as that.\"  He said, \"Here; I have brought  your bag back.\"  That conquered me.  After that kind of magnanimous  act in forgiving me and bringing my bag back so pleasantly and kindly,  I was his friend, and would have fought for him.  I felt sorry that we  had taken him out \"a larking.\"      HANGING TWO SPIES    I can now recall to memory but one circumstance that made a deep  impression on my mind at the time.  I heard that two spies were going to  be hung on a certain day, and I went to the hanging.  The scaffold was  erected, two coffins were placed on the platform, the ropes were dangling  from the cross beam above.  I had seen men shot, and whipped, and shaved,  and branded at Corinth and Tupelo, and one poor fellow named Wright shot  at Shelbyville.  They had all been horrid scenes to me, but they were  Rebels, and like begets like.  I did not know when it would be my time to  be placed in the same position, you see, and \"a fellow feeling makes us  wondrous kind.\"  I did not know what was in store in the future for me.  Ah, there was the rub, don't you see.  This shooting business wasn't a  pleasant thing to think about.  But Yankees--that was different.  I  wanted to see a Yankee spy hung.  I wouldn't mind that.  I would like to  see him agonize.  A spy; O, yes, they had hung one of our regiment at  Pulaski--Sam Davis.  Yes, I would see the hanging.  After a while I saw a  guard approach, and saw two little boys in their midst, but did not see  the Yankees that I had been looking for.  The two little boys were rushed  upon the platform.  I saw that they were handcuffed.  \"Are they spies?\"  I was appalled; I was horrified; nay, more, I was sick at heart.  One was  about fourteen and the other about sixteen years old, I should judge.  The ropes were promptly adjusted around their necks by the provost  marshal.  The youngest one began to beg and cry and plead most piteously.  It was horrid.  The older one kicked him, and told him to stand up and  show the Rebels how a Union man could die for his country.  Be a man!  The charges and specifications were then read.  The props were knocked  out and the two boys were dangling in the air.  I turned off sick at  heart.      EATING RATS    While stationed at this place, Chattanooga, rations were very scarce and  hard to get, and it was, perhaps, economy on the part of our generals and  commissaries to issue rather scant rations.    About this time we learned that Pemberton's army, stationed at Vicksburg,  were subsisting entirely on rats.  Instead of the idea being horrid,  we were glad to know that \"necessity is the mother of invention,\" and  that the idea had originated in the mind of genius.  We at once acted  upon the information, and started out rat hunting; but we couldn't find  any rats.  Presently we came to an old outhouse that seemed to be a  natural harbor for this kind of vermin.  The house was quickly torn down  and out jumped an old residenter, who was old and gray.  I suppose that  he had been chased before.  But we had jumped him and were determined to  catch him, or \"burst a boiler.\"  After chasing him backwards and forwards,  the rat finally got tired of this foolishness and started for his hole.  But a rat's tail is the last that goes in the hole, and as he went in we  made a grab for his tail.  Well, tail hold broke, and we held the skin of  his tail in our hands.  But we were determined to have that rat.  After  hard work we caught him.  We skinned him, washed and salted him, buttered  and peppered him, and fried him.  He actually looked nice.  The delicate  aroma of the frying rat came to our hungry nostrils.  We were keen to eat  a piece of rat; our teeth were on edge; yea, even our mouth watered to  eat a piece of rat.  Well, after a while, he was said to be done.  I got a piece of cold corn dodger, laid my piece of the rat on it,  eat a little piece of bread, and raised the piece of rat to my mouth,  when I happened to think of how that rat's tail did slip.  I had lost my  appetite for dead rat.  I did not eat any rat.  It was my first and last  effort to eat dead rats.      SWIMMING THE TENNESSEE WITH ROASTINGEARS    The Tennessee river is about a quarter of a mile wide at Chattanooga.  Right across the river was an immense corn-field.  The green corn was  waving with every little breeze that passed; the tassels were bowing and"]]]
