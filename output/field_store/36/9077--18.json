As the warm days of spring came on  Ilbrahim was accustomed to remain for hours silent and inactive within  hearing of the children's voices at their play, yet with his usual  delicacy of feeling he avoided their notice, and would flee and hide  himself from the smallest individual among them. Chance, however, at  length seemed to open a medium of communication between his heart and  theirs; it was by means of a boy about two years older than Ilbrahim,  who was injured by a fall from a tree in the vicinity of Pearson's  habitation. As the sufferer's own home was at some distance, Dorothy  willingly received him under her roof and became his tender and  careful nurse.    Ilbrahim was the unconscious possessor of much skill in physiognomy,  and it would have deterred him in other circumstances from attempting  to make a friend of this boy. The countenance of the latter  immediately impressed a beholder disagreeably, but it required some  examination to discover that the cause was a very slight distortion of  the mouth and the irregular, broken line and near approach of the  eyebrows. Analogous, perhaps, to these trifling deformities was an  almost imperceptible twist of every joint and the uneven prominence of  the breast, forming a body regular in its general outline, but faulty  in almost all its details. The disposition of the boy was sullen and  reserved, and the village schoolmaster stigmatized him as obtuse in  intellect, although at a later period of life he evinced ambition and  very peculiar talents. But, whatever might be his personal or moral  irregularities, Ilbrahim's heart seized upon and clung to him from the  moment that he was brought wounded into the cottage; the child of  persecution seemed to compare his own fate with that of the sufferer,  and to feel that even different modes of misfortune had created a sort  of relationship between them. Food, rest and the fresh air for which  he languished were neglected; he nestled continually by the bedside of  the little stranger and with a fond jealousy endeavored to be the  medium of all the cares that were bestowed upon him. As the boy became  convalescent Ilbrahim contrived games suitable to his situation or  amused him by a faculty which he had perhaps breathed in with the air  of his barbaric birthplace. It was that of reciting imaginary  adventures on the spur of the moment, and apparently in inexhaustible  succession. His tales were, of course, monstrous, disjointed and  without aim, but they were curious on account of a vein of human  tenderness which ran through them all and was like a sweet familiar  face encountered in the midst of wild and unearthly scenery. The  auditor paid much attention to these romances and sometimes  interrupted them by brief remarks upon the incidents, displaying  shrewdness above his years, mingled with a moral obliquity which  grated very harshly against Ilbrahim's instinctive rectitude. Nothing,  however, could arrest the progress of the latter's affection, and  there were many proofs that it met with a response from the dark and  stubborn nature on which it was lavished. The boy's parents at length  removed him to complete his cure under their own roof.    Ilbrahim did not visit his new friend after his departure, but he made  anxious and continual inquiries respecting him and informed himself of  the day when he was to reappear among his playmates. On a pleasant  summer afternoon the children of the neighborhood had assembled in the  little forest-crowned amphitheatre behind the meeting-house, and the  recovering invalid was there, leaning on a staff. The glee of a score  of untainted bosoms was heard in light and airy voices, which danced  among the trees like sunshine become audible; the grown men of this  weary world as they journeyed by the spot marvelled why life,  beginning in such brightness, should proceed in gloom, and their  hearts or their imaginations answered them and said that the bliss of  childhood gushes from its innocence. But it happened that an  unexpected addition was made to the heavenly little band. It was  Ilbrahim, who came toward the children with a look of sweet confidence  on his fair and spiritual face, as if, having manifested his love to  one of them, he had no longer to fear a repulse from their society. A  hush came over their mirth the moment they beheld him, and they stood  whispering to each other while he drew nigh; but all at once the devil  of their fathers entered into the unbreeched fanatics, and, sending up  a fierce, shrill cry, they rushed upon the poor Quaker child. In an  instant he was the centre of a brood of baby-fiends, who lifted sticks  against him, pelted him with stones and displayed an instinct of  destruction far more loathsome than the bloodthirstiness of manhood.    The invalid, in the mean while, stood apart from the tumult, crying  out with a loud voice, \"Fear not, Ilbrahim; come hither and take my  hand,\" and his unhappy friend endeavored to obey him. After watching  the victim's struggling approach with a calm smile and unabashed eye,  the foul-hearted little villain lifted his staff and struck Ilbrahim  on the mouth so forcibly that the blood issued in a stream. The poor  child's arms had been raised to guard his head from the storm of  blows, but now he dropped them at once. His persecutors beat him down,  trampled upon him, dragged him by his long fair locks, and Ilbrahim  was on the point of becoming as veritable a martyr as ever entered  bleeding into heaven. The uproar, however, attracted the notice of a  few neighbors, who put themselves to the trouble of rescuing the  little heretic, and of conveying him to Pearson's door.    Ilbrahim's bodily harm was severe, but long and careful nursing  accomplished his recovery; the injury done to his sensitive spirit was  more serious, though not so visible. Its signs were principally of a  negative character, and to be discovered only by those who had  previously known him. His gait was thenceforth slow, even and unvaried  by the sudden bursts of sprightlier motion which had once corresponded  to his overflowing gladness; his countenance was heavier, and its  former play of expression--the dance of sunshine reflected from moving  water--was destroyed by the cloud over his existence; his notice was  attracted in a far less degree by passing events, and he appeared to  find greater difficulty in comprehending what was new to him than at a  happier period. A stranger founding his judgment upon these  circumstances would have said that the dulness of the child's  intellect widely contradicted the promise of his features, but the  secret was in the direction of Ilbrahim's thoughts, which were  brooding within him when they should naturally have been wandering  abroad. An attempt of Dorothy to revive his former sportiveness was  the single occasion on which his quiet demeanor yielded to a violent  display of grief; he burst into passionate weeping and ran and hid  himself, for his heart had become so miserably sore that even the hand  of kindness tortured it like fire. Sometimes at night, and probably in  his dreams, he was heard to cry, \"Mother! Mother!\" as if her place,  which a stranger had supplied while Ilbrahim was happy, admitted of no  substitute in his extreme affliction. Perhaps among the many  life-weary wretches then upon the earth there was not one who combined  innocence and misery like this poor broken-hearted infant so soon the  victim of his own heavenly nature.    While this melancholy change had taken place in Ilbrahim, one of an  earlier origin and of different character had come to its perfection  in his adopted father. The incident with which this tale commences  found Pearson in a state of religious dulness, yet mentally disquieted  and longing for a more fervid faith than he possessed. The first  effect of his kindness to Ilbrahim was to produce a softened feeling,  an incipient love for the child's whole sect, but joined to this, and  resulting, perhaps, from self-suspicion, was a proud and ostentatious  contempt of their tenets and practical extravagances. In the course of  much thought, however--for the subject struggled irresistibly into his  mind--the foolishness of the doctrine began to be less evident, and  the points which had particularly offended his reason assumed another  aspect or vanished entirely away. The work within him appeared to go  on even while he slept, and that which had been a doubt when he laid  down to rest would often hold the place of a truth confirmed by some  forgotten demonstration when he recalled his thoughts in the morning.  But, while he was thus becoming assimilated to the enthusiasts, his  contempt, in nowise decreasing toward them, grew very fierce against  himself; he imagined, also, that every face of his acquaintance wore a  sneer, and that every word addressed to him was a gibe. Such was his  state of mind at the period of Ilbrahim's misfortune, and the emotions  consequent upon that event completed the change of which the child had  been the original instrument.    In the mean time, neither the fierceness of the persecutors nor the  infatuation of their victims had decreased. The dungeons were never  empty; the streets of almost every village echoed daily with the lash;  the life of a woman whose mild and Christian spirit no cruelty could  embitter had been sacrificed, and more innocent blood was yet to  pollute the hands that were so often raised in prayer. Early after the  Restoration the English Quakers represented to Charles II. that a  \"vein of blood was open in his dominions,\" but, though the displeasure  of the voluptuous king was roused, his interference was not prompt.  And now the tale must stride forward over many months, leaving"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1371"],[0,"Astoria; Or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains (#16)"],[1,"e.  They had eleven miles of open bay to traverse; the wind was fresh, the  waves ran high. Comcomly remonstrated with them on the hazard to which  they would be exposed. They were resolute, however, and launched their  boat, while the wary chieftain followed at some short distance in his  canoe. Scarce had they rowed a mile, when a wave broke over their boat  and upset it. They were in imminent peril of drowning, especially Mr.  M'Dougal, who could not swim. Comcomly, however, came bounding over the  waves in his light canoe, and snatched them from a watery grave.    They were taken on shore and a fire made, at which they dried their  clothes, after which Comcomly conducted them back to his village. Here  everything was done that could be devised for their entertainment during  three days that they were detained by bad weather. Comcomly made  his people perform antics before them; and his wives and daughters  endeavored, by all the soothing and endearing arts of women, to find  favor in their eyes. Some even painted their bodies with red clay, and  anointed themselves with fish oil, to give additional lustre to their  charms. Mr. M'Dougal seems to have had a heart susceptible to the  influence of the gentler sex. Whether or no it was first touched on this  occasion we do not learn; but it will be found, in the course of this  work, that one of the daughters of the hospitable Comcomly eventually  made a conquest of the great eri of the American Fur Company.    When the weather had moderated and the sea became tranquil, the one-eyed  chief of the Chinooks manned his state canoe, and conducted his  guests in safety to the ship, where they were welcomed with joy, for  apprehensions had been felt for their safety. Comcomly and his people  were then entertained on board of the Tonquin, and liberally rewarded  for their hospitality and services. They returned home highly satisfied,  promising to remain faithful friends and allies of the white men.          CHAPTER IX.         Point George--Founding of Astoria--Indian Visitors.--Their       Reception.--The Captain Taboos the Ship.--Departure of the       Tonquin.--Comments on the Conduct of Captain Thorn.    FROM the report made by the two exploring partners, it was determined  that Point George should be the site of the trading house. These  gentlemen, it is true, were not perfectly satisfied with the place,  and were desirous of continuing their search; but Captain Thorn was  impatient to land his cargo and continue his voyage, and protested  against any more of what he termed \"sporting excursions.\"    Accordingly, on the 12th of April the launch was freighted with all  things necessary for the purpose, and sixteen persons departed in her to  commence the establishment, leaving the Tonquin to follow as soon as the  harbor could be sounded.    Crossing the wide mouth of the river, the party landed, and encamped at  the bottom of a small bay within Point George. The situation chosen for  the fortified post was on an elevation facing to the north, with the  wide estuary, its sand bars and tumultuous breakers spread out before  it, and the promontory of Cape Disappointment, fifteen miles distant,  closing the prospect to the left. The surrounding country was in all the  freshness of spring; the trees were in the young leaf, the weather was  superb, and everything looked delightful to men just emancipated from a  long confinement on shipboard. The Tonquin shortly afterwards made her  way through the intricate channel, an came to anchor in the little bay,  and was saluted from the encampment with three volleys of musketry and  three cheers. She returned the salute with three cheers and three guns.    All hands now set to work cutting down trees, clearing away thickets,  and marking out the place for the residence, storehouse, and powder  magazine, which were to be built of logs and covered with bark. Others  landed the timbers intended for the frame of the coasting vessel, and  proceeded to put them together, while others prepared a garden spot, and  sowed the seeds of various vegetables.    The next thought was to give a name to the embryo metropolis: the one  that naturally presented itself was that of the projector and supporter  of the whole enterprise. It was accordingly named ASTORIA.    The neighboring Indians now swarmed about the place. Some brought a few  land-otter and sea-otter skins to barter, but in very scanty parcels;  the greater number came prying about to gratify their curiosity, for  they are said to be impertinently inquisitive; while not a few came  with no other design than to pilfer; the laws of meum and tuum being  but slightly respected among them. Some of them beset the ship in  their canoes, among whom was the Chinook chief Comcomly, and his liege  subjects. These were well received by Mr. M'Dougal, who was delighted  with an opportunity of entering upon his functions, and acquiring  importance in the eyes of his future neighbors. The confusion thus  produced on board, and the derangement of the cargo caused by this petty  trade, stirred the spleen of the captain, who had a sovereign contempt  for the one-eyed chieftain and all his crew. He complained loudly of  having his ship lumbered by a host of \"Indian ragamuffins,\" who had not  a skin to dispose of, and at length put his positive interdict upon  all trafficking on board. Upon this Mr. M'Dougal was fain to land, and  establish his quarters at the encampment, where he could exercise his  rights and enjoy his dignities without control.    The feud, however, between these rival powers still continued, but was  chiefly carried on by letter. Day after day and week after week elapsed,  yet the store-house requisite for the reception of the cargo was not  completed, and the ship was detained in port; while the captain was  teased by frequent requisitions for various articles for the use of the  establishment, or the trade with the natives. An angry correspondence  took place, in which he complained bitterly of the time wasted in  \"smoking and sporting parties,\" as he termed the reconnoitering  expeditions, and in clearing and preparing meadow ground and turnip  patches, instead of despatching his ship. At length all these jarring  matters were adjusted, if not to the satisfaction, at least to the  acquiescence of all parties. The part of the cargo destined for the use  of Astoria was landed, and the ship left free to proceed on her voyage.    As the Tonquin was to coast to the north, to trade for peltries at the  different harbors, and to touch at Astoria on her return in the autumn,  it was unanimously determined that Mr. M'Kay should go in her as  supercargo, taking with him Mr. Lewis as ship's clerk. On the first of  June the ship got under way, and dropped down to Baker's Bay, where she  was detained for a few days by a head wind; but early in the morning of  the fifth stood out to sea with a fine breeze and swelling canvas, and  swept off gaily on her fatal voyage, from which she was never to return!    On reviewing the conduct of Captain Thorn, and examining his peevish and  somewhat whimsical correspondence, the impression left upon our mind is,  upon the whole, decidedly in his favor. While we smile at the simplicity  of his heart and the narrowness of his views, which made him regard  everything out of the direct path of his daily duty, and the rigid  exigencies of the service, as trivial and impertinent, which inspired  him with contempt for the swelling vanity of some of his coadjutors, and  the literary exercises and curious researches of others, we cannot but  applaud that strict and conscientious devotion to the interests of his  employer, and to what he considered the true objects of the enterprise  in which he was engaged. He certainly was to blame occasionally for the  asperity of his manners, and the arbitrary nature of his measures, yet  much that is exceptionable in this part of his conduct may be traced to  rigid notions of duty acquired in that tyrannical school, a ship of war,  and to the construction given by his companions to the orders of Mr.  Astor, so little in conformity with his own. His mind, too, appears to  have become almost diseased by the suspicions he had formed as to the  loyalty of his associates, and the nature of their ultimate designs; yet  on this point there were circumstances to, in some measure, justify him.  The relations between the United States and Great Britain were at that  time in a critical state; in fact, the two countries were on the eve of  a war. Several of the partners were British subjects, and might be ready  to desert the flag under which they acted, should a war take place.  Their application to the British minister at New York shows the dubious  feeling with which they had embarked in the present enterprise. They had  been in the employ of the Northwest Company, and might be disposed  to rally again under that association, should events threaten the  prosperity of this embryo establishment of Mr. Astor. Besides, we have  the fact, averred to us by one of the partners, that some of them, who  were young and heedless, took a mischievous and unwarrantable pleasure  in playing upon the jealous temper of the captain, and affecting  mysterious consultations and sinister movements.    These circumstances are cited in palliation of the doubts and surmises  of Captain Thorn, which might otherwise appear strange and unreasonable.  That most of the partners were perfectly upright and faithful in the  discharge of the trust reposed in them we are fully satisfied; still the  honest captain was not invariably wrong in his suspicions; and that  he formed a pretty just opinion of the integrity of that aspiring  personage, Mr. M'Dougal, will be substantially proved in the sequel.
