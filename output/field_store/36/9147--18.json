The  latter can be manufactured at a very low cost from brewers' and  distillers' waste products, and there is a strong incentive for  unscrupulous dealers to substitute it secretly. Artificial meat extracts  prepared from yeast have the appearance and taste of meat extracts, but  some, at least, have a considerably sharper flavour. In one method of  manufacture common salt is added, and this renders it unfit for use in  more than very small quantities as a flavouring. J. Graff has made  analyses of ten yeast extracts, and contrasted them with meat extracts  (see _Analyst_ 1904, page 194), and says, \"It will be seen that the  chemical composition of yeast extract does not greatly differ from that of  meat extract.\" Yeast extracts contain purin bodies, and are probably  equally as injurious as meat extracts. Such strong and rank flavours (the  odour is suggestive to us of putrefaction) should be discouraged by those  who would cultivate a refined taste in food.    Flesh Bases and Waste Products.--As the result of destructive  metamorphosis or the wearing out of the body, there remain certain waste  products which have to be expelled as soon as is possible. Their retention  and accumulation would soon produce death. A part is expelled by the  lungs as carbon-dioxide, or as it is generally though less correctly  termed, carbonic acid. Upon the breaking down of the complex proteid and  other nitrogenous matter, the nitrogen is left in comparatively simple  combinations. These effete nitrogen compounds are commonly termed flesh  bases or nitrogenous extractives. They exist in small quantity in flesh  meat, but are concentrated and conserved in the making of beef-tea or  beef-extract. The spleen, lymphatic and other glands, and especially the  liver, break these down into still simpler compounds, so that the kidneys  may readily separate them from the blood, that they may pass out of the  body. By far the largest part of this waste nitrogen is expelled from the  bodies of men and many other mammals in the form of urea. Pure urea is an  odourless transparent crystalline substance, of cooling saline taste like  nitre. It is soluble in an equal volume of water, and is expelled from the  body with great ease. In the herbivora the nitrogenous waste takes the  form of another body called hippuric acid. The nearly solid light-coloured  urinary excretion of birds and serpents consists of urates; this is uric  acid in combination with alkalies. In man, in addition to the urea  excreted, there is also a little hippuric and uric acid or compounds of  these. Uric acid is a transparent colourless crystalline body almost  insoluble in water but soluble as urates in the presence of alkalies. As  deposited from urine it is of a dull red sand-like appearance, as it has a  great affinity for any colouring matter that is present.    It is only possible to make a brief reference to the chief organic bases.  The xanthine bases are closely related to uric acid. Some of these occur  in small quantity in the urine and animal tissues, others, such as  caffeine, occur in plants. Creatine is a constant constituent of muscle  substance. In fowl's flesh there is said to be 0.32 per cent., in cod-fish  0.17 per cent., and in beef 0.07 per cent. Creatinine is produced from  creatine with great facility; it exists in urine. Both creatine and  creatinine are readily soluble in water. A series of bases, closely allied  to creatinine have been isolated from the flesh of large animals by A.  Gautier; they are known as Gautier's flesh bases. When administered to  animals, these act more or less powerfully on the nerve centres, inducing  sleep and in some cases causing vomiting and purging in a manner similar  to the alkaloids of snake venom, but less powerfully than the ptomaines.  These bases are formed during life as a result of normal vital processes  and are termed leucomaines.    Another class of bases of an alkaloidal nature, are termed ptomaines;  these differ from the leucomaines, being produced by putrefactive or  bacterial agency from dead flesh. The poisoning which has occasionally  resulted from the eating of sausages, pork-pies, tinned meats, etc., is  due to their having contained ptomaines.    Such quantities of waste products as are produced in the healthy body are  excreted with ease, but it is otherwise in certain diseases. Either  specially noxious substances are produced, or the usual substances are in  excessive quantity and not eliminated with sufficient rapidity; in  consequence the body is poisoned. Those who eat largely of flesh,  introduce into their system the excretory matter contained therein, which  super-added to the excretory matter resulting from the vital processes of  the body puts an unusual and unnatural strain upon the liver and kidneys.  It has been observed, that the eating of the flesh of some trapped animals  has produced severe symptoms of poisoning. The pain and horror of having a  limb bleeding and mangled in a most cruel steel trap, the struggles which  only add to the misery, slowly being done to death during hours or even  days of torture, has produced in their bodies virulent poisons. Leucomaine  poisons have also been produced by the violent and prolonged exertions of  an animal, fleeing from its pursuers, until its strength was completely  spent. Cases are also known, where a mother nursing her infant, has given  way to violent anger or other emotion, and the child at the breast has  been made violently ill. We must not expect the flesh of any hunted or  terrified animals to be wholesome. Animals brought in cattle ships across  the Atlantic, suffer acutely. After rough weather they will often arrive  in a maimed condition, some being dead. To this is added the terror and  cruelty to which they are subjected whilst driven by callous drovers,  often through a crowded city, to the slaughter house to which they have an  instinctive dread. It is only to be expected that the dead flesh from such  animals, should contain an unusually large quantity of the more poisonous  flesh bases.    Purin Bodies.--The term purin has been applied to all bodies containing  the nucleus C_{5}N_{4}. It comprises the xanthine group and the uric acid  group of bodies. The principal purins are hypoxanthin, xanthin, uric acid,  guanin, adenin, caffeine and theobromine. Purins in the body may either  result from the wear and tear of certain cell contents, when they are  called endogenous purins; or they are introduced in the food, when they  are distinguished as exogenous purins. These purins are waste products and  are readily converted into uric acid. The production of some uric acid by  tissue change is, of course, unavoidable; but that resulting from the  purins in food is under control.    An excess of uric acid is commonly associated with gout and similar  diseases. The morbid phenomena of gout are chiefly manifested in the  joints and surrounding tissues. The articular cartilages become swollen,  with ensuing great pain. There is an accumulation of mortar like matter  about the joints. This is calcium urate (not sodium urate as is generally  stated). These nodular concretions are called tophi or chalkstones.    Very many are the hypotheses which have been propounded on the cause of  gout and the part played by uric acid; many have had to be discarded or  greatly modified. Though much light has recently been thrown on the  subject, there remains much that is obscure. The subject is one which is  surrounded with great difficulties, and would not be suitable for  discussion here, were it not for the following reason: Certain views on  uric acid as the cause of gout and several other diseases, are at the  present time being pushed to the extreme in some health journals and  pamphlets. Unfortunately many of the writers have very little knowledge,  either of chemistry or physiology, and treat the question as though it  were a simple one that had been quite settled. Our purpose is to clear the  ground to some extent, for a better understanding of its fundamentals,  and to warn against dogmatism. Our remarks, however, must be brief. It is  undeniable that great eaters of meat, especially if they also take  liberally of alcoholic drinks, are prone to diseases of the liver and  kidneys, about or soon after the time of middle life. Flesh meat contains  relatively large quantities of purins. Purins are metabolised in the body  to uric acid, about half of the uric acid produced in the body disappears  as such, being disintegrated, whilst the other half remains to be excreted  by the kidneys.    One view is that whilst the organs of the body can readily dispose of its  endogenous uric acid, or that produced by its own tissue change, together  with the small amount of uric acid derived from most foods, the organs are  strained by the larger quantity introduced in flesh-food or any other food  rich in purins: that there is an accumulation in the system of some of  this uric acid. Vegetable foods tend to keep the blood alkaline, flesh  possesses less of this property; alkalinity of the blood is thought to be  favourable to the elimination of uric acid, whilst anything of an acid  nature acts contrarily. Dr. Alexander Haig writes \"I consider that every  man who eats what is called ordinary diet with butcher's meat twice a day,  and also drinks acid wine or beer, will, by the time he is 50, have  accumulated 300 to 400 grains of uric acid in his tissues, and possibly  much more; and about this time, owing to the large amount of uric acid in  his body, he will probably be subject to attacks"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#16)"],[1,"angliers, petits singes, outardes, francolains,  perdreaux, pintades_ and other game birds. Permission is also given to  kill _in a scientific manner_. one elephant in the close season. It will  thus be seen that the State is determined to protect the wild animals of  the forest from indiscriminate slaughter and stringent laws regulating  hunting are decreed from time to time.    [Illustration: THE UBANGI RIVER.]          CHAPTER V.    The Ubangi River.--Irebu to Banzyville.      We leave Irebu on August 29th in the _Florida_ and steam up the river  Ubangi. The colour of the water at once changes for whereas the Congo  carries much sand and is brown, the Ubangi carries much clay and is a  dirty yellow. The banks are densely wooded and in the stream are many  islands also covered with forest. Lying on patches of sand or on the  fallen trunks of trees are many crocodiles asleep. There is not much  sport in shooting them but one which was leisurely swimming up stream  about fifty yards from the ship, made a sporting shot and was killed  with a bullet in the heart. As the cabin is small and hot, we arrange to  sleep on the bridge of the steamer which is almost embedded in trees  when we tie up to the bank for the night. A tornado bursts about  midnight, but the dense foliage acts as a protection and very little  water finds its way into our improvised bedroom.    Next day we stop at Bobanghe, a native Wood-Post, and go ashore. The  huts here are thatched with grass, for palms seem scarce. Some of the  men have black beards which they plait into one or two tails, producing  a curious appearance and while they fish, the women do the work of the  village and the marketing. Several of them were sitting on logs,  contentedly puffing tobacco smoke from wooden pipes while they offered  fish, fruit and vegetables for sale to our crew and native passengers.  One variety of fish was particularly noticeable; it was coloured like a  trout, but had a long snout on the dorsal side. We bought one, and it  proved very good eating. The forest here is full of rubber plants,  nearly every vine and leaf, when broken, yielding the milky sap which  dries, or can be coagulated, into rubber.    One day the boy Jean fell overboard, but leisurely undressed in the  water and swam to the bank, whence he was rescued by the canoe of the  steamer. He was perfectly calm but Chikaia burst into tears and loudly  blubbered. Very little indeed is sufficient to arouse emotionalism in  some-of the natives, who are always laughing or crying, fortunately the  former more often than the latter.    The banks of the Ubangi descend as a rule, sheer into deep water and are  often indeed miniature cliffs. No attempt is made to fashion steps and  the villagers slide down the banks as best they can and thus form a rude  path to the water. A half dozen men in an hour could make a convenient  inclined plain or steps, but the native only does what work is  absolutely necessary in order to live, and although loving ease, will  not take the trouble to make himself more comfortable. So he climbs  painfully up the bank every night from his canoe and slides down again  every morning without attempting to improve the path. The vanity of the  native however, causes him to take great pains to--as he thinks--improve  his personal appearance. Brass collars and bangles are very uncommon on  the Ubangi and beads take their place. The women wear short skirts made  of vegetable fibres plaited, which must take days or weeks to construct.  These are black or red in colour and are suspended from the waist, but  as the fibre is somewhat stiff, they project all round like the dress of  a ballet dancer. These are peculiar to the Ubangi and are rarely worn by  other tribes. The men wear only loin cloths and often carry a large  straight knife suspended by a leather belt strapped round the chest.    It is very hot from midday to sunset, but the nights are comparatively  cool. One afternoon we saw a great number of serpent-birds perched high  up on a bulbous tree, and, as they are good to eat, stopped to shoot  some. They were not at all shy and did not depart after several shots  had been fired, but wheeled round and round as if to discover what was  the cause of the strange noise. Ball, 3 and 5' shot were equally  efficacious and more than a dozen fell in a few minutes. These birds  have a beautiful black and white plumage with a long neck and bill and  webbed feet and weigh five or six pounds each. The flavour is somewhat  like ptarmigan and the natives eat them, as usual, without waiting until  they were properly cooked.    In the evening I took a stroll in the forest and soon found the recent  spoor of an elephant. Chikaia was just ahead, when he suddenly stopped  and whispered _macat_ pointing in the air. There was a fine monkey and  the boy's instinct for such a choice morsel, actually caused him to  stop, although he knew very well it would have been absurd to fire and  so frighten the elephant. At one time we must have been within a few  yards of the beast when a snapping of a twig or some sound disturbed him  and with a bellow he rushed away crashing through the forest. It is  curious that while birds are so bold in Africa, ground game is extremely  shy and most difficult to stalk.    On September 2nd we reach Imese, the first place on the Ubangi where  there are white men. Mr. Donneaux was the Chef du poste and everything  was in good order. Rubber vines were being planted in the forest and  rubber shrubs in the clearings. Coffee was also growing and pineapples  and other fruits looked well. All the houses are, as usual, of brick  which are of better quality than on the Congo, as the clay is good and  very abundant. The native village is about ten minutes' walk distant and  is arranged in two or three regular streets and not in patches of huts  dotted down here and there as in the Lake Tumba District. The State  impost here is one kilogramme of rubber each month from each man for  which he is paid 40 or 50 centimes. Collecting this amount takes one or  two days and the rest of the time the native works for himself or not  as he chooses. Here the people seem more industrious than in most parts,  many women being engaged in making mats and pottery. The pots are  fashioned by hand with the aid of a round stone and are so wonderfully  symmetrical that they resemble those made on a lathe. The clay is  obtained from the river bed by diving and after the vessel is made, it  is first dried in the sun and then baked in a wood fire. While still  hot, it is painted with gum copal which renders it water-tight.    [Illustration: YOUNG COFFEE TREES AT COQUILHATVILLE.]    At dinner we have a dish called _beefsteak American_. formed apparently  of very tender, cold meat with green salad and mayonnaise. On asking  however, we hear it is the raw flesh of goat cut up small. It is  certainly the best way of eating goat's flesh, for any method of cooking  seems to extract what little juice it possesses and convert it into a  substance resembling old leather. The name is curious, for it is neither  beef nor steak, and is probably as rare in America as Irish stew is in  Ireland or Welsh rarebit in Wales.    There are some very fine canoes here, very often carved throughout their  entire length, a favourite device being a crocodile. Two or three very  large _tom-toms_. are also in the village. These instruments are carved  from a solid piece of a tree six or eight feet long, most of the  interior being extracted through a narrow slit-like aperture two or  three inches wide and running nearly the length of the tom-tom. The  result is a hollow instrument, giving one or two different notes when  struck in different parts which can be heard for many miles. In case of  war, the whole country side can be quickly aroused, but the _tom-tom_.  is also used during peace as a telegraph.    At Imese two soldiers and their future brides came on board for the  purpose of travelling to Libenge to be married, for only Commissaires of  Districts and Missionaries can legally join two into one. The send off  was quite pretty, the happy couples being pelted with flowers as they  stepped on board, while one friend--perhaps a kind of best man--threw  his cap into the river. The State encourages regular marriages,  especially among the soldiers. The wife then works in the gardens or  plantations, while her husband drills, and returns at midday and in the  evening to cook his food.    Next day we reach Dongo, a village situated on a hill perhaps 200 feet  high. After looking at flat forest for weeks, this appears a veritable  mountain and it seems quite a stiff climb up the rough path constructed  as usual only by the feet of the people who have used it. Mr. Vannini,  an Italian officer, is constructing a Post here with the aid of some ten  or fifteen soldiers. Dongo is a very large village containing perhaps  3000 people and the huts are arranged in streets running parallel to  each other with their ends towards the river. The physique of the people  is very good indeed, some of the men being more than six feet in height.  The women mostly wear copper collars, three inches high and with a  second horizontal collar attached on the outside. The whole is hammered  on and must be intensely uncomfortable. A special pillow, consisting of  a piece of wood hollowed out for the head is necessary, as sleep would  otherwise be impossible with such a contrivance round the neck. A great  number of children run about and seem to be well nourished. Some have  large heads and protruding stomachs, without however, other signs of  _rickets_. Many of the men are painted with yellow stripes, an  indication that they have killed their man in battle, and these donned  their fighting clothes of many colours and with shields and spears posed  to be photographed, dancing around and uttering wild war whoops.
