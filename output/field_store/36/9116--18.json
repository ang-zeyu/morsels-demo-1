In a few moments the policeman was before us and we alighted  in presence of the representative of the law, with our feet  on the accursed soil of the district in which we were born.  The policeman stopped.  By his looks and his familiar \"Dag jong\"  we noticed that the policeman was Dutch, and the embodiment of affability.  He spoke and we were glad to notice that he had no intention  of dragging an innocent man to prison.  We were many miles  from the nearest police station, and in such a case  one is generally able to gather the real views of the man on patrol,  as distinct from the written code of his office, but our friend  was becoming very companionable.  Naturally we asked him about  the operation of the plague law.  He was a Transvaaler, he said,  and he knew that Kafirs were inferior beings, but they had rights,  and were always left in undisturbed possession of their property  when Paul Kruger was alive.  \"The poor devils must be sorry now,\" he said,  \"that they ever sang `God save the Queen' when the British troops  came into the Transvaal, for I have seen, in the course of my duties,  that a Kafir's life nowadays was not worth a ----, and I believe that no man  regretted the change of flags now more than the Kafirs of Transvaal.\"  This information was superfluous, for personal contact  with the Natives of Transvaal had convinced us of the fact.  They say it is only the criminal who has any reason to rejoice over  the presence of the Union Jack, because in his case the cat-o'-nine-tails,  except for very serious crimes, has been abolished.    \"Some of the poor creatures,\" continued the policeman,  \"I knew to be fairly comfortable, if not rich, and they enjoyed  the possession of their stock, living in many instances just like Dutchmen.  Many of these are now being forced to leave their homes.  Cycling along this road you will meet several of them in search of new homes,  and if ever there was a fool's errand, it is that of a Kafir  trying to find a new home for his stock and family just now.\"    \"And what do you think, Baas Officer, must eventually be the lot of a people  under such unfortunate circumstances?\" we asked.    \"I think,\" said the policeman, \"that it must serve them right.  They had no business to hanker after British rule, to cheat and plot  with the enemies of their Republic for the overthrow of their Government.  Why did they not assist the forces of their Republic during the war  instead of supplying the English with scouts and intelligence?  Oom Paul would not have died of a broken heart and he would still be there  to protect them.  Serve them right, I say.\"    So saying he spurred his horse, which showed a clean pair of hoofs.  He left us rather abruptly, for we were about to ask  why we, too, of Natal and the Cape were suffering, for we,  being originally British subjects, never \"cheated and plotted with  the enemies of our Colonies\", but he was gone and left us still cogitating  by the roadside.    Proceeding on our journey we next came upon a native trek  and heard the same old story of prosperity on a Dutch farm:  they had raised an average 800 bags of grain each season,  which, with the increase of stock and sale of wool, gave a steady income  of about 150 Pounds per year after the farmer had taken his share.  There were gossipy rumours about somebody having met some one  who said that some one else had overheard a conversation  between the Baas and somebody else, to the effect that the Kafirs  were getting too rich on his property.  This much involved tale  incidentally conveys the idea that the Baas was himself getting too rich  on his farm.  For the Native provides his own seed, his own cattle,  his own labour for the ploughing, the weeding and the reaping,  and after bagging his grain he calls in the landlord to receive his share,  which is fifty per cent of the entire crop.    All had gone well till the previous week when the Baas came  to the native tenants with the story that a new law had been passed  under which \"all my oxen and cows must belong to him, and my family to work  for 2 Pounds a month, failing which he gave me four days to leave the farm.\"    We passed several farm-houses along the road, where all  appeared pretty tranquil as we went along, until the evening  which we spent in the open country, somewhere near the boundaries  of the Hoopstad and Boshof districts; here a regular circus had gathered.  By a \"circus\" we mean the meeting of groups of families,  moving to every point of the compass, and all bivouacked at this point  in the open country where we were passing.  It was heartrending  to listen to the tales of their cruel experiences derived from  the rigour of the Natives' Land Act.  Some of their cattle had perished  on the journey, from poverty and lack of fodder, and the native owners  ran a serious risk of imprisonment for travelling with dying stock.  The experience of one of these evicted tenants is typical of the rest,  and illustrates the cases of several we met in other parts of the country.    Kgobadi, for instance, had received a message describing  the eviction of his father-in-law in the Transvaal Province, without notice,  because he had refused to place his stock, his family, and his person  at the disposal of his former landlord, who now refuses  to let him remain on his farm except on these conditions.  The father-in-law asked that Kgobadi should try and secure a place for him  in the much dreaded \"Free\" State as the Transvaal had suddenly  become uninhabitable to Natives who cannot become servants;  but \"greedy folk hae lang airms\", and Kgobadi himself  was proceeding with his family and his belongings in a wagon,  to inform his people-in-law of his own eviction, without notice,  in the \"Free\" State, for a similar reason to that which sent  his father-in-law adrift.  The Baas had exacted from him  the services of himself, his wife and his oxen, for wages of 30s. a month,  whereas Kgobadi had been making over 100 Pounds a year, besides retaining  the services of his wife and of his cattle for himself.  When he refused the extortionate terms the Baas retaliated with a Dutch note,  dated the 30th day of June, 1913, which ordered him to \"betake himself  from the farm of the undersigned, by sunset of the same day,  failing which his stock would be seized and impounded,  and himself handed over to the authorities for trespassing on the farm.\"    A drowning man catches at every straw, and so we were again and again  appealed to for advice by these sorely afflicted people.  To those who were not yet evicted we counselled patience and submission  to the absurd terms, pending an appeal to a higher authority  than the South African Parliament and finally to His Majesty the King who,  we believed, would certainly disapprove of all that we saw on that day  had it been brought to his notice.  As for those who were already evicted,  as a Bechuana we could not help thanking God that Bechuanaland  (on the western boundary of this quasi-British Republic) was still  entirely British.  In the early days it was the base of David Livingstone's  activities and peaceful mission against the Portuguese and Arab slave trade.  We suggested that they might negotiate the numerous restrictions  against the transfer of cattle from the Western Transvaal and seek an asylum  in Bechuanaland.  We wondered what consolation we could give  to these roving wanderers if the whole of Bechuanaland were under  the jurisdiction of the relentless Union Parliament.    It was cold that afternoon as we cycled into the \"Free\" State from Transvaal,  and towards evening the southern winds rose.  A cutting blizzard  raged during the night, and native mothers evicted from their homes  shivered with their babies by their sides.  When we saw on that night  the teeth of the little children clattering through the cold,  we thought of our own little ones in their Kimberley home of an evening  after gambolling in their winter frocks with their schoolmates,  and we wondered what these little mites had done that a home should suddenly  become to them a thing of the past.    Kgobadi's goats had been to kid when he trekked from his farm;  but the kids, which in halcyon times represented the interest on his capital,  were now one by one dying as fast as they were born and left by the roadside  for the jackals and vultures to feast upon.    This visitation was not confined to Kgobadi's stock,  Mrs. Kgobadi carried a sick baby when the eviction took place,  and she had to transfer her darling from the cottage to the jolting ox-wagon  in which they left the farm.  Two days out the little one began to sink  as the result of privation and exposure on the road, and the night  before we met them its little soul was released from its earthly bonds.  The death of the child added a fresh perplexity to the stricken parents.  They had no right or title to the farm lands through which they trekked:  they must keep to the public roads -- the only places in the country  open to the outcasts if they are possessed of a travelling permit.  The deceased child had to be buried, but where, when, and how?    This young wandering family decided to dig a grave under cover of the darkness  of that night, when no one was looking, and in that crude manner  the dead child was interred -- and interred amid fear and trembling,  as well as the throbs of a torturing anguish, in a stolen grave,  lest the proprietor of the spot, or any of his servants, should surprise them  in the act.  Even criminals dropping straight from the gallows  have an undisputed claim to six feet of ground on which to rest  their criminal remains, but under the cruel operation of the Natives' Land Act  little children, whose only crime is that God did not make them white,  are sometimes denied that right"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#16)"],[1,"an almost immediate ascendency in the Federal Government. To the  South was thus opened by an unexpected combination of circumstances a  wide avenue for the acquisition of fabulous wealth, and to Southern  public men an incomparable arena for the exercise of political abilities  and leadership. An institution, which thus ministered to two of the  strongest passions of mankind--avarice and ambition--was certain to  excite the most intense attachment. Its safety naturally, therefore,  became among the slave class an object of prime importance. Southern  jealousy in this regard ultimated inevitably in Southern narrowness,  Southern sectionalism, which early manifested themselves in the  exclusion from lead in national affairs of Northern public men, reputed  to be unfriendly to slavery. Webster as late as 1830, protested warmly  against this intolerance. Like begets like. And the proscribing of  anti-slavery politicians by the South, created in turn not a little  sectional feeling at the North, and helped to stimulate there a  consciousness of sectional differences, of antagonism of interests  between the two halves of the Union.    Discontent with the original basis of the Union, which had given the  South its political coign of vantage, broke out first in New England.  The occasion, though not the cause, of this discontent was, perhaps, the  downfall of the Federal party, whose stronghold was in the East. The  commercial and industrial crisis brought on by the embargo, and which  beggared, on the authority of Webster, \"thousands of families and  hundreds of thousands of individuals\" fanned this Eastern  dissatisfaction into almost open disaffection towards a government  dominated by Southern influence, and directed by Southern statesmanship.  To the preponderance of this Southern element in national legislation  New England traced her misfortunes. She was opposed to the War of 1812,  but was overruled to her hurt by the South. In these circumstances New  England went for correcting the inequalities of the original basis of  the Union, which gave to the South its undue preponderance in shaping  national laws and policies. This was the purpose of the Hartford  Convention, which proposed the abrogation of the slave representation  clause of the Constitution, and the imposition of a check upon the  admission of new States into the Union. The second proposition did not  say \"new slave States,\" but new slave States was, nevertheless, intended  by the Convention. Here in point of time and magnitude, was the first  distinct collision of the two sets of ideas and interests of the  Republic.    Following the Treaty of Ghent other and imperious questions engaged the  public attention--questions of the tariff, of finance, internal  improvements, national defence, a new navy, forts and fortifications.  Hard times, too, engrossed an enormous share of this attention. The  immediate needs and problems of the hour pushed into the background all  less pressing ones. The slavery question amidst the clamor and babel of  emergent and material interests, lost something of its sectional heat  and character. But its fires were not extinguished, only banked as  events were speedily to reveal.    The application of Missouri for admission into the Union as a slave  State four years after the Hartford Convention blew to a blaze the  covered embers of strife between the sections. The North was violently  agitated. For the admission of a new slave State meant two more slave  votes in the Senate, and an increase on the old inequitable basis of  slave representation in the lower House of Congress. It meant to the  Northern section indefinite Southern ascendency, prolonged Southern lead  in national legislation. All the smouldering passions of the earlier  period, of embargo, and non-intercourse, and the war of 1812, flamed  suddenly and fiercely in the heart of the free States.    The length and bitterness of that controversy excited the gravest  apprehensions for the stability of the Union. The dread of disunion led  to mutual concessions, to the Missouri Compromise. The slave-holding  section got its immediate claim allowed, and the free States secured the  erection of a line to the north of which slavery was forever prohibited.  And besides this, the admission of Maine was supposed to neutralize  whatever political advantages, which would accrue to the South from the  admission of Missouri as a slave State. Both sections were content, and  the slavery question was thought to be permanently settled. With this  final disposition of an ugly problem, the peace and permanence of the  Union were viewed universally as fixed facts. Still, considering the  gravity of the case, a little precaution would not go amiss. The slavery  question had shaken men's faith in the durability of the republic. It  was therefore adjudged a highly dangerous subject. The political  physicians with one accord prescribed on the ounce-of-prevention  principle, _quiet_, SILENCE, and OBLIVION, to be administered in large  and increasing doses to both sections. Mum was the word, and mum the  country solemnly and suddenly became from Maine to Georgia. But, alas!  beneath the ashes of this Missouri business, deep below the unnatural  silence and quiet, inextinguishable fires were burning and working again  to the surface of politics. In such circumstances a fresh outbreak of  old animosities must occur as soon as the subterranean heat should reach  the point of highest combustibility in the federal system. The tariff  proved to be that point of highest combustibility.    Alexander Hamilton inaugurated the policy of giving governmental aid to  infant manufactures. The wisdom of diversifying the industries of the  young nation was acquiesced in by the leading statesmen of both  sections. Beset as the republic then was by international forces hostile  to democratic institutions, it was natural enough that the great men who  presided over its early years should seek by Federal legislation to  render it, as speedily and completely as possible, industrially  self-dependent and self-supporting. The war of 1812 enforced anew upon  the attention of statesmen the importance of industrial independence.  The war debt, together with certain governmental enterprises and  expenditures growing out of the war, was largely, if not wholly,  responsible for the tariff of 1816. This act dates the rise of our  American system of protection. It is curious to note that Southern men  were the leaders of this new departure in the national fiscal policy.  Calhoun, Clay, and Lowndes were the guiding spirits of that period of  industrial ferment and activity. They little dreamt what economic evils  were to fall in consequence upon the South. That section was not slow to  feel the unequal action of the protective principle. The character of  its labor incapacitated the South from dividing the benefits of the new  revenue policy with its free rival. The South of necessity was  restricted to a single industry, the tillage of the earth. Slave labor  did not possess the intelligence, the skill, the patience, the  mechanical versatility to embark successfully in manufacturing  enterprises. Free labor monopolised the protected industries, and  Northern capital caught all the golden showers of fiscal legislation.  What the South needed, from an economic point of view, was unrestricted  access to the markets of the world for her products, and the freest  competition of the world in her own markets. The limitations imposed  upon the slave States by their industrial system was in itself a  tremendous handicap in their struggle for an advantageous place in the  New World of the nineteenth century; in their struggle with their free  sisters for political leadership in the Union. But with the development  of the protective principle those States fell into sore financial  distress, were ground between the upper millstone of the protective  system and the nether millstone of their own industrial system.  Prosperity and plenty did presently disappear from that section and  settled in the North. In 1828 Benton drew this dark picture of the state  of the South:    \"In place of wealth, a universal pressure for money was felt; not enough  for common expenses; the price of all property down; the country  drooping and languishing; towns and cities decaying, and the frugal  habits of the people pushed to the verge of universal self-denial for  the preservation of their family estates.\"    He did not hesitate to charge to Federal legislation the responsibility  for all this poverty and distress, for he proceeds to remark that:    \"Under this legislation the exports of the South have been made the  basis of the Federal revenue. The twenty odd millions annually levied  upon imported goods are deducted out of the price of their cotton, rice,  and tobacco, either in the diminished prices which they receive for  those staples in foreign ports, or in the increased price which they pay  for the articles they have to consume at home.\"    A suffering people are not apt to reason clearly or justly on the causes  which have brought them to indigence. They feel their wretchedness and  reach out for a victim. And the law-making power usually happens to be  that victim. As the distress of the South increased, the belief that  Federal legislation was responsible for it increased likewise. The  spread and deepening of this conviction in the Southern States  precipitated among them an ominous crisis in their attachment to the  Union. Nullification and an embittered sectionalism was the hateful  legacy bequeathed to the republic by the tariff controversy. It left the  South in a hyper-sensitive state in all matters relating to her domestic  interests. It left the North in a hyper-sensitive condition on all  matters touching the peace and stability of the Union. The silence and  oblivion policy on the subject of slavery was renewed with "]]]
