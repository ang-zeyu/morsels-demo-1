And this normal state  of happiness is not alloyed, as with us, by long periods--whole lives  often--of poverty or ill-health, and of the unsatisfied longing for  pleasures which others enjoy but to which we cannot attain. Illness, and  what answers to poverty in animals--continued hunger--are quickly  followed by unanticipated and almost painless extinction. Where we err  is, in giving to animals feelings and emotions which they do not  possess. To us the very sight of blood and of torn or mangled limbs is  painful, while the idea of the suffering implied by it is heartrending.  We have a horror of all violent and sudden death, because we think of  the life full of promise cut short, of hopes and expectations  unfulfilled, and of the grief of mourning relatives. But all this is  quite out of place in the case of animals, for whom a violent and a  sudden death is in every way the best. Thus the poet's picture of          \"Nature red in tooth and claw           With ravine\"      is a picture the evil of which is read into it by our imaginations, the  reality being made up of full and happy lives, usually terminated by the  quickest and least painful of deaths.    On the whole, then, we conclude that the popular idea of the struggle  for existence entailing misery and pain on the animal world is the very  reverse of the truth. What it really brings about, is, the maximum of  life and of the enjoyment of life with the minimum of suffering and  pain. Given the necessity of death and reproduction--and without these  there could have been no progressive development of the organic  world,--and it is difficult even to imagine a system by which a greater  balance of happiness could have been secured. And this view was  evidently that of Darwin himself, who thus concludes his chapter on the  struggle for existence: \"When we reflect on this struggle, we may  console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not  incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and  that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 4: _Geographic Botanique_, p. 798.]    [Footnote 5: _The Origin of Species_, p. 53.]    [Footnote 6: _The Earth as Modified by Human Action_, p. 51.]    [Footnote 7: _The Origin of Species_, p. 56.]    [Footnote 8: See _Nature_, vol. xxxi. p. 63.]    [Footnote 9: _A Visit to South America_, 1878; also _Nature_, vol. xxxi.  pp. 263-339.]    [Footnote 10: Still more remarkable is the increase of rabbits both in  New Zealand and Australia.

The foundation of the Darwinian theory is the variability of species,  and it is quite useless to attempt even to understand that theory, much  less to appreciate the completeness of the proof of it, unless we first  obtain a clear conception of the nature and extent of this variability.  The most frequent and the most misleading of the objections to the  efficacy of natural selection arise from ignorance of this subject, an  ignorance shared by many naturalists, for it is only since Mr. Darwin  has taught us their importance that varieties have been systematically  collected and recorded; and even now very few collectors or students  bestow upon them the attention they deserve. By the older naturalists,  indeed, varieties--especially if numerous, small, and of frequent  occurrence--were looked upon as an unmitigated nuisance, because they  rendered it almost impossible to give precise definitions of species,  then considered the chief end of systematic natural history. Hence it  was the custom to describe what was supposed to be the \"typical form\" of  species, and most collectors were satisfied if they possessed this  typical form in their cabinets. Now, however, a collection is valued in  proportion as it contains illustrative specimens of all the varieties  that occur in each species, and in some cases these have been carefully  described, so that we possess a considerable mass of information on the  subject. Utilising this information we will now endeavour to give some  idea of the nature and extent of variation in the species of animals and  plants.    It is very commonly objected that the widespread and constant  variability which is admitted to be a characteristic of domesticated  animals and cultivated plants is largely due to the unnatural conditions  of their existence, and that we have no proof of any corresponding  amount of variation occurring in a state of nature. Wild animals and  plants, it is said, are usually stable, and when variations occur these  are alleged to be small in amount and to affect superficial characters  only; or if larger and more important, to occur so rarely as not to  afford any aid in the supposed formation of new species.    This objection, as will be shown, is utterly unfounded; but as it is one  which goes to the very root of the problem, it is necessary to enter at  some length into the various proofs of variation in a state of nature.  This is the more necessary because the materials collected by Mr. Darwin  bearing on this question have never been published, and comparatively  few of them have been cited in _The Origin of Species_; while a  considerable body of facts has been made known since the publication of  the last edition of that work.      _Variability of the Lower Animals_.    Among the lowest and most ancient marine organisms are the Foraminifera,  little masses of living jelly, apparently structureless, but which  secrete beautiful shelly coverings, often perfectly symmetrical, as  varied in form as those of the mollusca and far more complicated. These  have been studied with great care by many eminent naturalists, and the  late Dr. W.B. Carpenter in his great work--the _Introduction to the  Study of the Foraminifera_--thus refers to their variability: \"There is  not a single species of plant or animal of which the range of variation  has been studied by the collocation and comparison of so large a number  of specimens as have passed under the review of Messrs. Williamson,  Parker, Rupert Jones, and myself in our studies of the types of this  group;\" and he states as the result of this extensive comparison of  specimens: \"The range of variation is so great among the Foraminifera  as to include not merely those differential characters which have been  usually accounted _specific_, but also those upon which the greater part  of the _genera_, of this group have been founded, and even in some  instances those of its _orders_.\"[16]    Coming now to a higher group--the Sea-Anemones--Mr. P.H. Gosse and other  writers on these creatures often refer to variations in size, in the  thickness and length of the tentacles, the form of the disc and of the  mouth, and the character of surface of the column, while the colour  varies enormously in a great number of the species. Similar variations  occur in all the various groups of marine invertebrata, and in the great  sub-kingdom of the mollusca they are especially numerous. Thus, Dr. S.P.  Woodward states that many present a most perplexing amount of variation,  resulting (as he supposes) from supply of food, variety of depth and of  saltness of the water; but we know that many variations are quite  independent of such causes, and we will now consider a few cases among  the land-mollusca in which they have been more carefully studied.    In the small forest region of Oahu, one of the Sandwich Islands, there  have been found about 175 species of land-shells represented by 700 or  800 varieties; and we are told by the Rev. J.T. Gulick, who studied them  carefully, that \"we frequently find a genus represented in several  successive valleys by allied species, sometimes feeding on the same,  sometimes on different plants. In every such case the valleys that are  nearest to each other furnish the most nearly allied forms; _and a full  set of the varieties of each species presents a minute gradation of  forms between the more divergent types found in the more widely  separated localities_.\"    In most land-shells there is a considerable amount of variation in  colour, markings, size, form, and texture or striation of the surface,  even in specimens collected in the same locality. Thus, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#12)"],[1,"model which gives the best predictions  of the evolution of that external reality will be activated. However, when the  external reality is complex, the main model has to activate some other models,  to be able to predict better and better the evolution of that external  reality. A parameter of the personality is the capacity to keep control of the  main activity even when the main model activates some others model. Thus, the  stability in the main model is a parameter associated with the personality.    Example: there are some persons who start from a subject and evolve in a  rather chaotic way to other subjects so that the main subject is sometimes  forgotten.    Another parameter of a personality is associated with the fact that, although  the structure of models has to be stable, the structure must be compatible  with some models imposed from outside, by education. Without some main models  imposed from outside (by education), a human being will be not compatible with  the external reality.    By education, some models must be present in any brain (some of them must be  in the PSM). Any human being is able to integrate into society, based on them.    There are now very big problems associated with education, in the present  human society. The main problem is the fact that the society (including in  most advanced countries) is evolving very fast based on symbolic models and  the education is not able to keep the pace with this fast evolution. E.g. the  usual method of education is to impose some story-type model (i.e. some models  of \"how to do\"-type). This method has increased too much the number of models  that must be stored by the brain and the brain is not capable anymore to store  and use all of them. Based on MDT, the normal solution should be to store some  normal models that can be tailored by each person to any specific situation.    Another parameter is associated with the tendency to think and act based on  long-range models or short-range models. Some persons behave based on a number  of long-range concept models (principles) which are used in any situation.  Other persons have specific short-range models for any specific external  reality. The personality parameter is typically situated between the two  limits mentioned above.    From the general theory, we know that some models generate knowledge and  others are used to modify the external reality. Thus, there are personalities  oriented mostly to knowledge and others are oriented mostly to change the  external reality.    There are persons who assimilate easily external models and others who prefer  to make their own models.    Also, there are image models and symbolic models.    We can make a partial matrix associated with a personality based on the  capacity to make/assimilate image/symbolic models, for instance.    Another very important parameter is associated with the content of the PSM. As  we know, a number of external models must be included in the PSM, by the  education process, so that the person is integrated in society. Unfortunately,  a lot of models could enter in PSM, in an uncontrolled way. Some of these  models could be bad models. They can be built, e.g. if a person is born and  lives (at least in childhood) in a bad environment. For a person who has such  bad models, there is still a chance to integrate in a normal society, by  making some shielding models. However, a shielding model is, usually, not safe  enough. Thus, in some situations, a person can act based on the bad models and  not based on the shielding models which had helped him/her to be accepted by  the society. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to know in advance the  content of the PSM, because the PSM acts only in very special and critical  situations. To be understood, this subject needs a lot of further work.    Here we present a general theory. It cannot go beyond some limits because the  technological implementation is, usually, not taken into account. However,  based on the theory, it is possible to develop the subject for specific  applications.    Now we shall list some parameters associated with the personality, based on  the above discussion. Some of the parameters associated with the personality  could be:    The orientation to image models  The orientation to symbolic models  The orientation to knowledge  The orientation to action on external reality  The orientation to make new models  The orientation to assimilate new models  The orientation on short-range models  The orientation on long-range models  The parameter associated with the diversity of action  The parameter associated with the stability in a model  The parameter associated with the conformity to society requirements  The parameter associated with non-standard models from PSM    A table could be made, for any person, with numerical values associated to the  above parameters. To do this, a local model must be developed. That model has  to contain a set of standard procedures to obtain such parameters.    This chapter, which is associated with the personality, refers only to normal,  mature persons (as these terms are already defined). The pathological cases  are not taken into account here. In fact, to study the pathological cases is a  nonsense before defining the normal situation.    This general theory, as it will be developed for specific situations, is  useful to understand also pathological cases. For instance, MDT defines XZM-  models (illegal models) as models which are not integrated in the normal  structure of models. Such models could be very important to issues related to  the personality, but there are still few data about XZM models.    There is another very important parameter associated with the personality,  which was not described above; it is a parameter associated to the  consciousness. Because it is so important, it will be described in a separated  section.      THE CONSCIOUSNESS    It is considered that there are some long-range ZM models (image or symbolic),  which contain the being as an element. When such a model is activated, it has  to initialize. That is, it has to find the positions of all the elements  (including the being itself) and to find all the relations between the  elements by interaction with the external reality.    The consciousness is the capacity of a brain to make and operate a model,  which contains the being as an element.    It is very important to emphasize that such models are normal models, which  are made by that brain in interaction with the external reality. Such models  cannot be assimilated by education, for instance.    The level of consciousness is associated with the capacity of that brain to  find and refresh, in a continuos way, the position of the being in a model.    Such models are long-range models. Their elements are already developed as  models. Some models can also contain some elements associated with the person.  The number of planes of consciousness could be high.    Example: I am a Romanian citizen. I live in Europe, so I am also European. I  have a job; I have a position there. I live in a block of flats; I have also a  position in relation with the others who also live in my block of flats, and  so on.    There are some models, which does not contain the person in an explicit way.  This is level-1 of conciousness. Only some parts of that person are taken into  account. The consciousness is of level 2 when the person appears in an  explicit way in relation with other persons. On level 2, the person is  integrated in a group; the person knows the aims and the rules of the group  and acts accordingly.    Examples: when a person drinks water from a glass, the person does not appear  in an explicit way; only some components of that person are taken into  account. If the person knows what he is doing, and is able to predict his  evolution, then he is on level 1 of consciousness. If a person plays a game in  a team, and he knows the aims and the rules of the group and communicates with  the members of the group, then that person is on level 2 of consciousness. On  level 2, the person is integrated in the model, as an explicit element, as any  other person of that group.    Problem: On level 2, a possible problem is to consider one's own activity as a  good one, and to consider that some other members of the group are low quality  persons. This could happen with a non-homogenous group, but also it is  possible that the model is a low quality one (the person has made a low  quality model associated with the aims and the rules of the group). As we  know, any model is made to be stable (logical or harmonic). We also know that  the stability of a model is not a guarantee that the model reflects in a good  way the external reality. Thus, for a good level 2 of consciousness, it is  necessary that all the members of the group have about the same basic model.    Observation: it is possible that faced with a new external reality, for which  there is no available model, the PSM activates itself. As the PSM is  activated, all the normal models are disabled and so the consciousness  disappears. Such a situation is called  \"shock status\". The consciousness  returns only after the normal structure of models regains control.    The highest level of consciousness is level 3. There are few persons who are  able to reach level 3 of consciousness. It is not easy to understand the  explanations associated with this level.    On level 3, a person is able, e.g. to think with \"the others' head\". Also, on  this level, a person is able to see how the others see him. This implies to  make a model which contains the model of the group as an element in a longer-  range model.    On level 3, the brain has to work very hard. There are few person who are able  to do such an effort. It is harder to do such an effort on image models than  on symbolic models. Usually, level 3 of consciousness is met on symbolic  models. However, the word \"empathy\""]]]
