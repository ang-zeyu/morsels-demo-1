Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#12)"],[1," a conch, brought forward a cockle-shell full of  salt-water, and delivered it solemnly to Amyas, who, of course, put a  noble into it, and returned it after Grenville had done the same.    \"Holla, Dick Admiral!\" cried neptune, who was pretty far gone in liquor;  \"we knew thou hadst a right English heart in thee, for all thou standest  there as taut as a Don who has swallowed his rapier.\"    \"Grammercy, stop thy bellowing, fellow, and on; for thou smellest vilely  of fish.\"    \"Everything smells sweet in its right place. I'm going home.\"    \"I thought thou wert there all along, being already half-seas over,\"  said Cary.    \"Ay, right Upsee-Dutch; and that's more than thou ever wilt be, thou  'long-shore stay-at-home. Why wast making sheep's eyes at Mistress  Salterne here, while my pretty little chuck of Burrough there was  playing at shove-groat with Spanish doubloons?\"    \"Go to the devil, sirrah!\" said Cary. Neptune had touched on a sore  subject; and more cheeks than Amyas Leigh's reddened at the hint.    \"Amen, if Heaven so please!\" and on rolled the monarch of the seas; and  so the pageant ended.    The moment Amyas had an opportunity, he asked his brother Frank,  somewhat peevishly, where Rose Salterne was.    \"What! the mayor's daughter? With her uncle by Kilkhampton, I believe.\"    Now cunning Master Frank, whose daily wish was to \"seek peace and ensue  it,\" told Amyas this, because he must needs speak the truth: but he was  purposed at the same time to speak as little truth as he could, for fear  of accidents; and, therefore, omitted to tell his brother how that he,  two days before, had entreated Rose Salterne herself to appear as the  nymph of Torridge; which honor she, who had no objection either to  exhibit her pretty face, to recite pretty poetry, or to be trained  thereto by the cynosure of North Devon, would have assented willingly,  but that her father stopped the pretty project by a peremptory  countermove, and packed her off, in spite of her tears, to the said  uncle on the Atlantic cliffs; after which he went up to Burrough, and  laughed over the whole matter with Mrs. Leigh.    \"I am but a burgher, Mrs. Leigh, and you a lady of blood; but I am too  proud to let any man say that Simon Salterne threw his daughter at your  son's head;--no; not if you were an empress!\"    \"And to speak truth, Mr. Salterne, there are young gallants enough in  the country quarrelling about her pretty face every day, without making  her a tourney-queen to tilt about.\"    Which was very true; for during the three years of Amyas's absence, Rose  Salterne had grown into so beautiful a girl of eighteen, that half North  Devon was mad about the \"Rose of Torridge,\" as she was called; and  there was not a young gallant for ten miles round (not to speak of her  father's clerks and 'prentices, who moped about after her like so many  Malvolios, and treasured up the very parings of her nails) who would  not have gone to Jerusalem to win her. So that all along the vales of  Torridge and of Taw, and even away to Clovelly (for young Mr. Cary was  one of the sick), not a gay bachelor but was frowning on his fellows,  and vying with them in the fashion of his clothes, the set of his ruffs,  the harness of his horse, the carriage of his hawks, the pattern of his  sword-hilt; and those were golden days for all tailors and armorers,  from Exmoor to Okehampton town. But of all those foolish young lads  not one would speak to the other, either out hunting, or at the archery  butts, or in the tilt-yard; and my Lady Bath (who confessed that there  was no use in bringing out her daughters where Rose Salterne was in the  way) prophesied in her classical fashion that Rose's wedding bid fair  to be a very bridal of Atalanta, and feast of the Lapithae; and poor  Mr. Will Cary (who always blurted out the truth), when old Salterne once  asked him angrily in Bideford Market, \"What a plague business had he  making sheep's eyes at his daughter?\" broke out before all bystanders,  \"And what a plague business had you, old boy, to throw such an apple of  discord into our merry meetings hereabouts? If you choose to have such  a daughter, you must take the consequences, and be hanged to you.\" To  which Mr. Salterne answered with some truth, \"That she was none of his  choosing, nor of Mr. Cary's neither.\" And so the dor being given, the  belligerents parted laughing, but the war remained in statu quo; and  not a week passed but, by mysterious hands, some nosegay, or languishing  sonnet, was conveyed into The Rose's chamber, all which she stowed away,  with the simplicity of a country girl, finding it mighty pleasant; and  took all compliments quietly enough, probably because, on the authority  of her mirror, she considered them no more than her due.    And now, to add to the general confusion, home was come young Amyas  Leigh, more desperately in love with her than ever. For, as is the  way with sailors (who after all are the truest lovers, as they are the  finest fellows, God bless them, upon earth), his lonely ship-watches  had been spent in imprinting on his imagination, month after month, year  after year, every feature and gesture and tone of the fair lass whom he  had left behind him; and that all the more intensely, because, beside  his mother, he had no one else to think of, and was as pure as the day  he was born, having been trained as many a brave young man was then,  to look upon profligacy not as a proof of manhood, but as what the old  Germans, and those Gortyneans who crowned the offender with wool, knew  it to be, a cowardly and effeminate sin.        CHAPTER III    OF TWO GENTLEMEN OF WALES, AND HOW THEY HUNTED WITH THE HOUNDS, AND YET  RAN WITH THE DEER         \"I know that Deformed; he has been a vile thief this seven years;       he goes up and down like a gentleman: I remember his name.\"--Much       Ado About Nothing.    Amyas slept that night a tired and yet a troubled sleep; and his mother  and Frank, as they bent over his pillow, could see that his brain was  busy with many dreams.    And no wonder; for over and above all the excitement of the day, the  recollection of John Oxenham had taken strange possession of his mind;  and all that evening, as he sat in the bay-windowed room where he had  seen him last, Amyas was recalling to himself every look and gesture  of the lost adventurer, and wondering at himself for so doing, till  he retired to sleep, only to renew the fancy in his dreams. At last he  found himself, he knew not how, sailing westward ever, up the wake of  the setting sun, in chase of a tiny sail which was John Oxenham's.  Upon him was a painful sense that, unless he came up with her in time,  something fearful would come to pass; but the ship would not sail. All  around floated the sargasso beds, clogging her bows with their long  snaky coils of weed; and still he tried to sail, and tried to fancy that  he was sailing, till the sun went down and all was utter dark. And then  the moon arose, and in a moment John Oxenham's ship was close aboard;  her sails were torn and fluttering; the pitch was streaming from her  sides; her bulwarks were rotting to decay. And what was that line of  dark objects dangling along the mainyard?--A line of hanged men! And,  horror of horrors, from the yard-arm close above him, John Oxenham's  corpse looked down with grave-light eyes, and beckoned and pointed, as  if to show him his way, and strove to speak, and could not, and pointed  still, not forward, but back along their course. And when Amyas looked  back, behold, behind him was the snow range of the Andes glittering in  the moon, and he knew that he was in the South Seas once more, and that  all America was between him and home. And still the corpse kept pointing  back, and back, and looking at him with yearning eyes of agony, and lips  which longed to tell some awful secret; till he sprang up, and woke with  a shout of terror, and found himself lying in the little coved chamber  in dear old Burrough, with the gray autumn morning already stealing in.    Feverish and excited, he tried in vain to sleep again; and after an  hour's tossing, rose and dressed, and started for a bathe on his beloved  old pebble ridge. As he passed his mother's door, he could not help  looking in. The dim light of morning showed him the bed; but its  pillow had not been pressed that night. His mother, in her long white  night-dress, was kneeling at the other end of the chamber at her  prie-dieu, absorbed in devotion. Gently he slipped in without a word,  and knelt down at her side. She turned, smiled, passed her arm around  him, and went on silently with her prayers. Why not? They were for him,  and he knew it, and prayed also; and his prayers were for her, and for  poor lost John Oxenham, and all his vanished crew.    At last she rose, and standing above him, parted the yellow locks from  off his brow, and looked long and lovingly into his face. There was  nothing to be spoken, for there was nothing to be concealed between  these two souls as clear as glass. Each knew all which the other meant;  each knew that its own thoughts were known. At last the mutual gaze was  over; she stooped and kissed him on the brow, and was in the act to  turn away, as a tear dropped on his forehead. Her little bare feet were  peeping out from under her dress. He bent down and kissed them again and  again; and then looking up, as if to excuse himself,--    \"You have such pretty feet, mother!\"    Instantly, with a woman's instinct, she had hidden them. She had been a  beauty once, as I said; and though her hair was gray, and her roses had  faded long ago, she was beautiful still, in all eyes which saw deeper  than the mere outward red and white.    \"Your dear father used to say so thirty years ago.\"    \"And I say so still: you always were beautiful; you are beautiful now.\"    \"What is that to you, silly boy?

Nothing is sacred to a valet, and from Casimir  I counted upon learning the real reason which had led this nobleman to  visit Paris at so troublous a time. Knowing the Grand Duke to be a man  of gallantry, I anticipated finding a woman in the case--and I was not  wrong.    Yes, there was a woman, and _nom d'nom!_she was beautiful.  Now in Paris we have many beautiful women, and in times of  international strife it is true that we have had to shoot some of  them. For my own part I say with joy that I have never been  instrumental in bringing a woman to such an end. Perhaps I am  sentimental; it is a French weakness; but on those few occasions when  I have found a guilty woman in my power--and she has been pretty--  _morbleu!_--she has escaped! It may be that I have seen to it that she  was kept out of further mischief, but nevertheless she has never met a  firing-party because of me. Very well.    From the good fellow Casimir I learned that a certain dancer appearing  at one of our Montmartre theatres had written to the Grand Duke craving  the honour of his autograph--and enclosing her photograph.    Pf! it was enough. One week later the autograph arrived--attached to an  invitation to dine with the Grand Duke at his hotel in Paris. Yes--he  had come to Paris. I have said that he was susceptible and I have said  that she was beautiful. I address myself to men of the world, and I  shall not be in error if I assume that they will say, \"A wealthy fool  and a designing woman. It is an old story.\" Let us see.    The confidences of Casimir interested me in more ways than one. In the  first place I had particular reasons for suspecting anyone who sought  to obtain access to the Grand Duke. These were diplomatic. And in the  second place I had suspicions of Zara el-Khala. These were personal.    Yes--so she called herself--Zara el-Khala, which in Arabic is  \"Flower of the Desert.\" She professed to be an Egyptian, and certainly  she had the long, almond-shaped eyes of the East, but her white skin  betrayed her, and I knew that whilst she might possess Eastern blood,  she was more nearly allied to Europe than to Africa. It is my business  to note unusual matters, you understand, and I noticed that this  beautiful and accomplished woman of whom all Paris was beginning to  speak rapturously remained for many weeks at a small Montmartre  theatre. Her performance, which was unusually decorous for the type  of establishment at which she appeared, had not apparently led to an  engagement elsewhere.    This aroused the suspicions to which I have referred. In the character  of a vaudeville agent I called at the Montmartre theatre and was  informed by the management that Zara-el-Khala received no visitors,  professional or otherwise. A small but expensive car awaited her at  the stage door. My suspicions increased. I went away, but returned on  the following night, otherwise attired, and from a hiding-place which  I had selected on the previous evening I watched the dancer depart.    She came out so enveloped in furs and veils as to be unrecognizable,  and a Hindu wearing a chauffeur's uniform opened the door of the car  for her, and then, having arranged the rugs to her satisfaction,  mounted to the wheel and drove away.    I traced the car. It had been hired for the purpose of taking Zara  el-Khala from her hotel--to the theatre and home nightly. I sent a  man to call upon her at the hotel--in order to obtain press material,  ostensibly. She declined to see him. I became really interested. I  sent her a choice bouquet, having the card of a nobleman attached to  it, together with a message of respectful admiration. It was returned.  I prevailed upon one of the most handsome and gallant cavalry officers  in Paris to endeavour to make her acquaintance. He was rebuffed.    _Eh bien!_ I knew then that Mlle. Zara of the Desert was unusual.    You will at once perceive that when I heard from the worthy Casimir  how this unapproachable lady had actually written to the Grand Duke  Ivan and had gone so far as to send him her photograph, I became  excited. It appeared to me that I found myself upon the brink of an  important discovery. I set six of my first-class men at work: three  being detailed to watch the hotel of the Grand Duke Ivan and three to  watch Zara el-Khala. Two more were employed in watching the Hindu  servant and one in watching my good friend Casimir. Thus, nine clever  men and myself were immediately engaged upon the case.    Why do I speak of a \"case\" when thus far nothing of apparent  importance had occurred? I will explain. Although the Grand Duke  travelled incognito, his Government knew of the journey and wished to  learn with what object it had been undertaken.    At the time that I made the acquaintance of Casimir the Grand Duke  had been in Paris for three days, and he was--according to my  informant--\"like a raging lion.\" The charming dancer had vouchsafed  no reply to his invitation and he had met with the same reception, on  presenting himself in person, which had been accorded to myself and to  those others who had sought to obtain an interview with Zara el-Khala!    My state of mystification grew more and more profound. I studied the  reports of my nine assistants.    It appeared that the girl had been in Paris for a period of two months.  She occupied a suite of rooms in which all her meals were served.  Except the Hindu who drove the hired car, she had no servant. She  never appeared in the public part of the hotel unless veiled, and then  merely in order to pass out to the car or in from it on returning. She  drove out every day. She had been followed, of course, but her  proceedings were unexceptionable. Leaving the car at a point in the  Bois De Boulogne, she would take a short walk, if the day was fine  enough, never proceeding out of sight of the Hindu, who followed with  the automobile, and would then drive back to her hotel. She never  received visits and never met any one during these daily excursions.    I turned to the report dealing with the Hindu.  He had hired a room high up under the roof of an apartment house where  foreign waiters and others had their abodes. He bought and cooked his  own food, which apparently consisted solely of rice, lentils and fruit.  He went every morning to the garage and attended to the car, called  for his mistress, and having returned remained until evening in his  own apartment. At night, after returning from the theatre, he  sometimes went out, and my agent had failed to keep track of him on  every occasion that he had attempted pursuit. I detached the man who  was watching Casimir and whose excellent reports revealed the fact  that Casimir was an honest fellow--as valets go--and instructed him  to assist in tracing the movements of the Hindu.    Two nights later they tracked him to a riverside cafe kept by a  gigantic quadroon from Dominique and patronized by that type which  forms a link between the lowest commercial and the criminal classes:  itinerant vendors of Eastern rugs, street performers and Turkish  cigarette makers.    At last I began to have hopes. The Grand Duke at this time was  speaking of leaving Paris, but as he had found temporary consolation  in the smiles of a lady engaged at the \"Folies\" I did not anticipate  that he would depart for several days at any rate. Also he was the  kind of man who is stimulated by obstacles.    The Hindu remained for an hour in the cafe, smoking and drinking  some kind of syrup, and one of my fellows watched him. Presently the  proprietor called him into a little room behind the counter and closed  the door. The Hindu and the quadroon remained there for a few minutes,  then the Hindu came out and left the cafe, returning to his abode.  There was a telephone in this inner room, and my agent was of opinion  that the Indian had entered either to make or to receive a call. I  caused the line to be tapped.    On the following night the Hindu came back to the cafe, followed by  one of my men. I posted myself at a selected point and listened for  any message that might pass over the line to or from the cafe. At  about the same hour as before--according to the report--someone called  up the establishment, asking for \"Miguel.\" This was the quadroon, and  I heard his thick voice replying. The other voice--which had first  spoken--was curiously sibilant but very distinct. Yet it did not sound  like the voice of a Frenchman or of any European. This was the  conversation:    \"Miguel.\"    \"Miguel speaks.\"    \"_Scorpion._ A message for Chunda Lal.\"    \"Very good.\"    Almost holding my breath, so intense was my excitement, I waited  whilst Miguel went to bring the Hindu. Suddenly a new voice  spoke--that of the Hindu.    \"Chunda Lal speaks,\" it said.    I clenched by teeth; I knew that I must not miss a syllable.    \"Scorpion\" replied ... in voluble _Hindustani_--a language of which I  know less than a dozen words!          CHAPTER II    CONCERNING THE GRAND DUKE      Although I had met with an unforeseen check, I had nevertheless learned  three things. I had learned that Miguel the quadroon was possibly in  league with the Hindu; that the Hindu was called Chunda Lal; and that  Chunda Lal received messages, probably instructions, from a third  party who announced his presence by the word \"_Scorpion_.\"    One of my fellows, of course, had been in the cafe all the evening,  and from him I obtained confirmation of the fact that it had been the  Hindu who had been summoned to the telephone and whom I had heard  speaking. Instant upon the man at the cafe replacing the telephone  and disconnecting, I called up the exchange. They had been warned and  were in readiness.    "]]]
