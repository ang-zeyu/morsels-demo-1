For  Mme. Homer is one of the most modest artists in the world; nothing is  more distasteful to her than to seek for publicity through ordinary  channels. So averse is she to any self-seeking that it was with  considerable hesitation that she consented to express her views to the  writer, on the singer's art. As Mr. Sidney Homer, the well known  composer and husband of Mme. Homer, remarked, the writer should prize  this intimate talk, as it was the first Mme. Homer had granted in a very  long time.    [Illustration: LOUISE HOMER]    The artist had lately returned from a long trip, crowded with many  concerts, when I called at the New York residence of this ideal musical  pair and their charming family. Mme. Homer was at home and sent down  word she would see me shortly. In the few moments of waiting, I seemed  to feel the genial atmosphere of this home, its quiet and cheer. A  distant tinkle of girlish laughter was borne to me once or twice; then a  phrase or two sung by a rich, vibrant voice above; then in a moment  after, the artist herself descended and greeted me cordially.    \"We will have a cup of tea before we start in to talk,\" she said, and,  as if by magic, the tea tray and dainty muffins appeared.    How wholesome and fresh she looked, with the ruddy color in her cheeks  and the firm whiteness of neck and arms. The Japanese robe of \"midnight  blue,\" embroidered in yellows, heightened the impression of vigorous  health by its becomingness.      FOR THE GIRL WHO WANTS TO MAKE A CAREER    \"There is so much to consider for the girl who desires to enter the  profession,\" began Mme. Homer, in response to my first query. \"First,  she must have a voice, there is no use attempting a career without the  voice; there must be something to develop, something worth while to  build upon. And if she has the voice and the means to study, she must  make up her mind to devote herself exclusively to her art; there is no  other way to succeed. She cannot enter society, go to luncheons, dinners  and out in the evening, and at the same time accomplish much in the way  of musical development. Many girls think, if they attend two or three  voice lessons a week and learn some songs and a few operatic arias, that  is all there is to it. But there is far more. They must know many other  things. The vocal student should study piano and languages; these are  really essential. Not that she should strive to become a pianist; that  would not be possible if she is destined to become a singer; but the  more she knows of the piano and its literature, the more this will  cultivate her musical sense and develop her taste.      HOW AN ARTIST WORKS    \"I am always studying, always striving to improve what I have already  learned and trying to acquire the things I find difficult, or that I  have not yet attained to. I do vocal technic every day; this is  absolutely essential, while one is in the harness. It is during the  winter that I work so industriously, both on technic and repertoire,  between tours. This is when I study. I believe in resting the voice part  of the year, and I take this rest in the summer. Then, for a time, I do  not sing at all. I try to forget there is such a thing as music in the  world, so far as studying it is concerned. Of course I try over Mr.  Homer's new songs, when they are finished, for summer is his time for  composition.    \"Since the voice is such an intangible instrument, the singer needs  regular guidance and criticism, no matter how advanced she may be. As  you say, it is difficult for the singer to determine the full effect of  her work; she often thinks it much better than it really is. That is  human nature, isn't it?\" she added with one of her charming smiles.      THE START IN OPERA    \"How did you start upon an operatic career?\" the singer was asked.    Just here Mr. Homer entered and joined in the conference.    \"I do not desire to go into my life-history, as that would take too  long. In a few words, this is how it happened--years ago.    \"We were living in Boston; I had a church position, so we were each busy  with our musical work. My voice was said to be 'glorious,' but it was a  cumbersome, unwieldy organ. I could only sing up to F; there were so  many things I wanted to do with my voice that seemed impossible, that I  realized I needed more training. I could have remained where I was; the  church people were quite satisfied, and I sang in concert whenever  opportunity offered. But something within urged me on. We decided to  take a year off and spend it in study abroad. Paris was then the Mecca  for singers and to Paris we went. I plunged at once into absorbing  study; daily lessons in voice training and repertoire; languages, and  French diction, several times a week, and soon acting was added, for  every one said my voice was for the theater. I had no idea, when I  started out, that I should go into opera. I had always loved to sing, as  far back as I can remember. My father was a Presbyterian clergyman, and  when we needed new hymn books for church or Sunday School, they used to  come to our house. I would get hold of every hymn book I could find and  learn the music. So I was always singing; but an operatic career never  entered my thought, until the prospect seemed to unfold before me, as a  result of my arduous study in Paris. Of course I began to learn  important arias from the operas. Every contralto aspires to sing the  grand air from the last act of _Le Prophete;_ you know it of course. I  told my teacher I could never do it, as it demanded higher tones than I  had acquired, going up to C. He assured me it would be perfectly easy in  a little while, if I would spend a few moments daily on those high  notes. His prediction was correct, for in a few months I had no trouble  with the top notes.    \"I studied stage deportment and acting from one of the greatest singing  actors of the French stage, Paul Lherie. What an artist he was! So  subtle, so penetrating, so comprehensive. The principles he taught are a  constant help to me now, and his remarks often come back to me as I  study a new role.    \"As I say, I studied this line of work, not knowing what would grow out  of it; I did it on faith, hoping that it might prove useful.\"    \"It seems to me,\" remarked the composer, \"that young singers would do  well to make a study of acting, along with languages and piano. Then, if  the voice developed and an operatic career opened to them, they would be  so much better prepared; they would have made a start in the right  direction; there would not be so much to learn all at once, later on.\"    \"If the girl could only be sure she was destined for a stage career,\"  said Mme. Homer, thoughtfully, \"she might do many things from the start  that she doesn't think of doing before she knows.    \"To go on with my Paris story. I kept faithfully at work for a year,  preparing myself for I knew not just what; I could not guess what was in  store. Then I got my first opera engagement, quite unexpectedly. I was  singing for some professional friends in a large _saale_. I noticed a  man standing with his back to me, looking out of one of the long  windows. When I finished, he came forward and offered me an engagement  at Vichy, for the summer season. The name Vichy only suggested to my  mind a kind of beverage. Now I learned the town had a flourishing Opera  House, and I was expected to sing eight roles. Thus my stage career  began.\"      WHAT ARE THE ASSETS FOR A CAREER?    \"And what must the girl possess, who wishes to make a success with her  singing?\" was asked.    \"First of all, as I have already said, she must have a voice; she can  never expect to get very far without that. Voice is a necessity for a  singer, but it rests with her what she will do with it, how she will  develop it.    \"The next asset is intelligence; that is as great a necessity as a  voice. For through the voice we express what we feel, what we are;  intelligence controls, directs, shines through and illumines everything.  Indeed what can be done without intelligence? I could mention a young  singer with a good natural voice, who takes her tones correctly, who  studies well; indeed one can find no fault with the technical side of  her work; but her singing has no meaning--it says absolutely nothing; it  only represents just so many notes.\"    \"That is because she has not a musical nature,\" put in Mr. Homer. \"To my  mind that is the greatest asset any one can have who wishes to become a  musician in any branch of the art. What can be done without a musical  nature? Of course I speak of the young singer who wishes to make a  career. There are many young people who take up singing for their own  pleasure, never expecting to do much with it. And it is a good thing to  do so. It gives pleasure to their family and friends--is a healthful  exercise, and last but not least, is financially good for the teacher  they employ.    \"But the trouble comes when these superficial students aspire to become  opera singers, after a couple of seasons' study. Of course they all cast  eyes at the Metropolitan, as the end and aim of all striving.    \"Just as if, when a young man enters a law office, it is going to lead  him to the White House, or that he expects it will,\" said Mr. Homer.    \"Then,\" resumed the artist, \"we have already three requirements for a  vocal career; Voice, Intelligence and a Musical Nature. I think the  Fourth should be a Capacity for Work. Without application, the gifts of  voice, intelligence and a musical nature will not make an artist. To  accomplish this task requires ceaseless labor, without yielding to  discouragement. Perhaps the Fifth asset would be a cheerful optimism as  proof against discouragement.    \"That is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15464"],[0,"Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them (1918) (#12)"],[1,"to which they are best adapted.    The word fat usually brings to one's mind an unappetizing chunk of  meat fat which most persons cannot and will not eat, and fatty foods  have been popularly supposed to be \"bad for us\" and \"hard to digest.\"  Fats are, however, an important food absolutely essential to complete  nutrition, which repay us better for the labor of digestion than any  other food. If they are indigestible, it is usually due to improper  cooking or improper use; if they are expensive, it is merely because  they are extravagantly handled. The chief function of fatty food is  to repair and renew the fatty tissues, to yield energy and to maintain  the body heat. The presence of fat in food promotes the flow of the  pancreatic juice and bile, which help in the assimilation of other  foods and assist the excretory functions of the intestine. These are  badly performed if bile and other digestive fluids are not secreted in  sufficient quantity. The absence of fat in the diet leads to a state  of malnutrition, predisposing to tuberculosis, especially in children  and young persons.    It is claimed that the most serious food shortage in Germany is fat;  that the civilian population is dying in large numbers because of  the lack of it, and that Von Hindenburg's men will lose out on the  basis of fat, rather than on the basis of munitions or military  organization. Worst of all is the effect of fat shortage on the  children of the nation. Leaders of thought all over Europe assert  that even if Germany wins, Germany has lost, because it has sapped the  strength of its coming generation.    The term fat is used to designate all products of fatty composition  and includes liquid fats such as oils, soft fats such as butter, and  hard fats such as tallow. While all fats have practically the same  energy-value, they differ widely from each other in their melting  point, and the difference in digestibility seems to correspond to the  difference in melting point. Butter burns at 240 degrees Fahrenheit,  while vegetable oils can be heated as high as 600 degrees Fahrenheit,  furnishing a very high temperature for cooking purposes before they  begin to burn. The scorching of fat not only wastes the product, but  renders it indigestible, even dangerous to some people, and for this  reason butter should never be used for frying, as frying temperature  is usually higher than 240 degrees. It is well to choose for cooking  only those fats which have the highest heat-resisting qualities  because they do not burn so easily.    Beginning with the lowest burning point, fats include genuine butter,  substitute butters, lard and its substitutes, and end with tallow and  vegetable oils. Of the latter, there is a varied selection from the  expensive olive oil to the cheaper cottonseed, peanut, cocoanut and  corn oils and their compounds and the hydrogenated oils.    The economy of fat, therefore, depends on the choice of the fat used  for the various cooking processes as well as the conservation of  all fatty residue, such as crackling, leftover frying fats and soup  fat. For cooking processes, such as sauteing (pan frying), or deep  fat frying, it is best to use the vegetable and nut oils. These are  more plentiful, and hence cheaper than the animal fats; the latter,  however, can be produced in the home from the fats of meats and  leftover pan fats, which should not be overlooked as frying mediums.  Butter and butter substitutes are best kept for table use and for  flavoring. The hydrogenated oils, home-rendered fats, lard and beef  and mutton suet can be used for shortening fats.    In the purchase of meats, the careful housewife should see that  the butcher gives her all the fat she pays for, as all fats can be  rendered very easily at home and can be used for cooking purposes.  Butchers usually leave as large a proportion of fat as possible on  all cuts of meat which, when paid for at meat prices, are quite an  expensive item. All good clear fat should, therefore, be carefully  trimmed from meats before cooking. Few people either like or find  digestible greasy, fat meats, and the fat paid for at meat prices,  which could have been rendered and used for cooking, is wasted when  sent to table.    There are various methods of conserving fat. First, the economical use  of table fats; second, the saving of cooking; and third, the proper  use of all types of fat.    Economy in the use of table fats may best be secured by careful  serving. One serving of butter is a little thing--there are about  sixty-four of them in a pound. In many households the butter left on  the plates probably would equal a serving or one-fourth of an ounce,  daily, which is usually scraped into the garbage pail or washed off in  the dishpan. But if everyone of our 20,000,000 households should waste  one-fourth of an ounce of butter daily, it would mean 312,500 pounds  a day, or 114,062,500 pounds a year. To make this butter would take  265,261,560 gallons of milk, or the product of over a half-million  cows, an item in national economy which should not be overlooked.    When butter is used to flavor cooked vegetables, it is more economical  to add it just before they are served rather than while they are  cooking. The flavor thus imparted is more pronounced, and, moreover,  if the butter is added before cooking, much of it will be lost in  the water unless the latter is served with the vegetables. Butter  substitutes, such as oleomargarine and nut margarine, should be more  largely used for the table, especially for adults. Conserve butter  for children, as animal fats contain vitamines necessary for growing  tissues. Butter substitutes are as digestible and as nourishing as  butter, and have a higher melting point. They keep better and cost  less.    Oleomargarine, which has been in existence for fifty years, was first  offered to the world in 1870 by a famous French chemist, Mege-Mouries,  who was in search of a butter substitute cheap enough to supply the  masses with the much-needed food element. He had noticed that the  children of the poor families were afflicted with rickets and other  diseases which could be remedied by the administration of the right  amount of fat. He combined fresh suet and milk and called the product  \"oleomargarine.\" In the United States this product is now made of oleo  oil or soft beef fat, neutral lard, cottonseed and other oils, churned  with a small quantity of milk, and in the finer grades, cream is  sometimes used. A certain proportion of butter is usually added, and  the whole worked up with salt as in ordinary butter-making.    Owing to the fears of the butter-makers that oleomargarine would  supplant their product in popular favor, legislation was enacted that  restricted the manufacture of oleo and established a rigid system of  governmental inspection, so that the product is now manufactured  under the most sanitary conditions which furnishes a cleaner and more  reliable product than natural butter.    Nut margarine is a compound of cocoa oil, which so closely resembles  butter that only an expert can distinguish it from the natural  product. Both these butter substitutes are used in large amounts by  the best bakers, confectioners and biscuit manufacturers, and foolish  prejudice against butter substitutes should not deter their use in the  home.    A large saving in cooking fats can be made by the careful utilization  of all fats that come into the home. Beef and mutton suet can be  rendered and made available. Fats which have been saved after meals  are cooked should be clarified--that is, freed from all objectionable  odors, tastes or color--so as to be made available as shortening and  frying fats.    The following recipes and suggestions make possible the use of all  fats, and as fat shortage is one of the most serious of the world's  food problems, it is essential that every housekeeper have a larger  knowledge of the utilization and economy of this essential food.    [Illustration]          TO RENDER FATS      TO RENDER FAT BY DIRECT METHOD    Run the fat through the household meat grinder or chop fine in the  chopping bowl. Then heat in the double boiler until completely melted,  finally straining through a rather thick cloth or two thicknesses  of cheese cloth, wrung out in hot water. By this method there is no  danger of scorching. Fats heated at a low temperature also keep better  than those melted at higher temperature. After the fat is rendered,  it should be slowly reheated to sterilize it and make sure it is free  from moisture. The bits of tissue strained out, commonly known as  cracklings, may be used for shortening purposes or may be added to  cornmeal which is to be used as fried cornmeal mush.      TO RENDER FAT WITH MILK    To two pounds of fat (finely chopped if unrendered) add one-half pint  of milk, preferably sour. Heat the mixture in a double boiler until  thoroughly melted. Stir well and strain through a thick cloth or two  thicknesses of cheese cloth wrung out in hot water. When cold the fat  forms a hard, clean layer and any material adhering to the under  side of the fat, may be scraped off. Sour milk being coagulated is  preferable to sweet milk since the curd remains on the cloth through  which the rendered mixture is strained and is thus more easily  separated from the rendered fat which has acquired some of the milk  flavor and butter fat.      TO RENDER FAT BY COLD WATER METHOD    Cut fat in small pieces. Cover with cold water. Heat slowly. Let cook  until bubbling ceases. Press fat during heating so as to obtain all  the oil possible. When boiling ceases strain through cheesecloth and  let harden. If desired one-half teaspoon salt, one-eighth teaspoon  pepper, 1 teaspoon onion and 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning may be added  before straining.      TO RENDER STRONG FLAVORED FATS    To mutton, duck or goose fat add equal amount of beef suet or  vegetable fat and render"]]]
