And what  plague is more effectual to do hurt than a foe of one's own household?'    FOOTNOTES:    [G] The sword of Damocles.        SONG V.    SELF-MASTERY.          Who on power sets his aim,      First must his own spirit tame;      He must shun his neck to thrust      'Neath th' unholy yoke of lust.      For, though India's far-off land      Bow before his wide command,      Utmost Thule homage pay--      If he cannot drive away      Haunting care and black distress,      In his power, he's powerless.        VI.      'Again, how misleading, how base, a thing ofttimes is glory! Well does  the tragic poet exclaim:        '\"Oh, fond Repute, how many a time and oft      Hast them raised high in pride the base-born churl!\"    For many have won a great name through the mistaken beliefs of the  multitude--and what can be imagined more shameful than that? Nay, they  who are praised falsely must needs themselves blush at their own  praises! And even when praise is won by merit, still, how does it add to  the good conscience of the wise man who measures his good not by popular  repute, but by the truth of inner conviction? And if at all it does seem  a fair thing to get this same renown spread abroad, it follows that any  failure so to spread it is held foul. But if, as I set forth but now,  there must needs be many tribes and peoples whom the fame of any single  man cannot reach, it follows that he whom thou esteemest glorious seems  all inglorious in a neighbouring quarter of the globe. As to popular  favour, I do not think it even worthy of mention in this place, since it  never cometh of judgment, and never lasteth steadily.    'Then, again, who does not see how empty, how foolish, is the fame of  noble birth? Why, if the nobility is based on renown, the renown is  another's! For, truly, nobility seems to be a sort of reputation coming  from the merits of ancestors. But if it is the praise which brings  renown, of necessity it is they who are praised that are famous.  Wherefore, the fame of another clothes thee not with splendour if thou  hast none of thine own. So, if there is any excellence in nobility of  birth, methinks it is this alone--that it would seem to impose upon the  nobly born the obligation not to degenerate from the virtue of their  ancestors.'        SONG VI.    TRUE NOBILITY.          All men are of one kindred stock, though scattered far and wide;      For one is Father of us all--one doth for all provide.      He gave the sun his golden beams, the moon her silver horn;      He set mankind upon the earth, as stars the heavens adorn.      He shut a soul--a heaven-born soul--within the body's frame;      The noble origin he gave each mortal wight may claim.      Why boast ye, then, so loud of race and high ancestral line?      If ye behold your being's source, and God's supreme design,      None is degenerate, none base, unless by taint of sin      And cherished vice he foully stain his heavenly origin.        VII.      'Then, what shall I say of the pleasures of the body? The lust thereof  is full of uneasiness; the sating, of repentance. What sicknesses, what  intolerable pains, are they wont to bring on the bodies of those who  enjoy them--the fruits of iniquity, as it were! Now, what sweetness the  stimulus of pleasure may have I do not know. But that the issues of  pleasure are painful everyone may understand who chooses to recall the  memory of his own fleshly lusts. Nay, if these can make happiness, there  is no reason why the beasts also should not be happy, since all their  efforts are eagerly set upon satisfying the bodily wants. I know,  indeed, that the sweetness of wife and children should be right comely,  yet only too true to nature is what was said of one--that he found in  his sons his tormentors. And how galling such a contingency would be, I  must needs put thee in mind, since thou hast never in any wise suffered  such experiences, nor art thou now under any uneasiness. In such a case,  I agree with my servant Euripides, who said that a man without children  was fortunate in his misfortune.'[H]      FOOTNOTES:    [H] Paley translates the lines in Euripides' 'Andromache': 'They [the  childless] are indeed spared from much pain and sorrow, but their  supposed happiness is after all but wretchedness.' Euripides' meaning is  therefore really just the reverse of that which Boethius makes it. See  Euripides, 'Andromache,' Il. 418-420.        SONG VII.    PLEASURE'S STING.              This is the way of Pleasure:      She stings them that despoil her;      And, like the winged toiler          Who's lost her honeyed treasure,        She flies, but leaves her smart        Deep-rankling in the heart.          VIII.      'It is beyond doubt, then, that these paths do not lead to happiness;  they cannot guide anyone to the promised goal. Now, I will very briefly  show what serious evils are involved in following them. Just consider.  Is it thy endeavour to heap up money? Why, thou must wrest it from its  present possessor! Art thou minded to put on the splendour of official  dignity? Thou must beg from those who have the giving of it; thou who  covetest to outvie others in honour must lower thyself to the humble  posture of petition. Dost thou long for power? Thou must face perils,  for thou wilt be at the mercy of thy subjects' plots. Is glory thy aim?  Thou art lured on through all manner of hardships, and there is an end  to thy peace of mind. Art fain to lead a life of pleasure? Yet who does  not scorn and contemn one who is the slave of the weakest and vilest of  things--the body? Again, on how slight and perishable a possession do  they rely who set before themselves bodily excellences! Can ye ever  surpass the elephant in bulk or the bull in strength? Can ye excel the  tiger in swiftness? Look upon the infinitude, the solidity, the swift  motion, of the heavens, and for once cease to admire things mean and  worthless. And yet the heavens are not so much to be admired on this  account as for the reason which guides them. Then, how transient is the  lustre of beauty! how soon gone!--more fleeting than the fading bloom of  spring flowers. And yet if, as Aristotle says, men should see with the  eyes of Lynceus, so that their sight might pierce through obstructions,  would not that body of Alcibiades, so gloriously fair in outward  seeming, appear altogether loathsome when all its inward parts lay open  to the view? Therefore, it is not thy own nature that makes thee seem  beautiful, but the weakness of the eyes that see thee. Yet prize as  unduly as ye will that body's excellences; so long as ye know that this  that ye admire, whatever its worth, can be dissolved away by the feeble  flame of a three days' fever. From all which considerations we may  conclude as a whole, that these things which cannot make good the  advantages they promise, which are never made perfect by the assemblage  of all good things--these neither lead as by-ways to happiness, nor  themselves make men completely happy.'        SONG VIII.    HUMAN FOLLY.            Alas! how wide astray      Doth Ignorance these wretched mortals lead        From Truth's own way!        For not on leafy stems      Do ye within the green wood look for gold,        Nor strip the vine for gems;          Your nets ye do not spread      Upon the hill-tops, that the groaning board        With fish be furnished;        If ye are fain to chase      The bounding goat, ye sweep not in vain search        The ocean's ruffled face.          The sea's far depths they know,      Each hidden nook, wherein the waves o'erwash        The pearl as white as snow;        Where lurks the Tyrian shell,      Where fish and prickly urchins do abound,        All this they know full well.          But not to know or care      Where hidden lies the good all hearts desire--        This blindness they can bear;        With gaze on earth low-bent,      They seek for that which reacheth far beyond        The starry firmament.          What curse shall I call down      On hearts so dull? May they the race still run        For wealth and high renown!        And when with much ado      The false good they have grasped--ah, then too late!--        May they discern the true!        IX.      'This much may well suffice to set forth the form of false happiness; if  this is now clear to thine eyes, the next step is to show what true  happiness is.'    'Indeed,' said I, 'I see clearly enough that neither is independence to  be found in wealth, nor power in sovereignty, nor reverence in  dignities, nor fame in glory, nor true joy in pleasures.'    'Hast thou discerned also the causes why this is so?'    'I seem to have some inkling, but I should like to learn more at large  from thee.'    'Why, truly the reason is hard at hand. _That which is simple and  indivisible by nature human error separates_, and transforms from the  true and perfect to the false and imperfect. Dost thou imagine that  which lacketh nothing can want power?'    'Certainly not.'    'Right; for if there is any feebleness of strength in anything, in this  there must necessarily be need of external protection.'    'That is so.'    'Accordingly, the nature of independence and power is one and the same.'    'It seems so.'    'Well, but dost think that anything of such a nature as this can be  looked upon with contempt, or is it rather of all things most worthy of  veneration?'    'Nay; there can be no doubt as to that.'    'Let us, then, add reverence to independence and power, and conclude  these three to be one.'    'We must if we will acknowledge the truth.'    'Thinkest thou, then, this combination of qualities to be obscure and  without distinction, or rather famous in all renown? Just consider: can  that want renown which has been agreed to be lacking in nothing, to be  supreme in power, and right worthy of honour, for the reason that it  cannot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#12)"],[1,"ce. And  to make a tone is to _do_ something. This doing something is an  action, and action comes from thought. No music, then, can be made  unless it be made by thinking. And the right playing of good music  must come from the right thinking of good thoughts. It may be that you  will hear some one say that to think good thoughts is not needed in  making good music. Never believe it! Bad thought never made anything  good, and _never_ will because it never can. In the very first days  you must learn, that good things of all kinds come from good thoughts,  because they can come from nothing else.    Here, then, is the second truth of this Talk:    Good music being the fruit of good thought can be played rightly only  by one who thinks good thoughts.    This leads us to another matter. First, let us see if everything is  clear. True music is written out of good thought; hence, when we begin  to study music we are really becoming pupils of good thought. We are  learning the thoughts good men have had, trying to feel their truth  and meaning, and from them learning to have our own thoughts not only  good but constantly better and better. This now seems simple and  necessary. We see that if we would faithfully study a composer's work  it must be our principal aim to get into his heart. Then everything  will be clear to us.    But we can never find our way to the heart of another until we have  first found our way somewhere else. Where, do you think? To our own  hearts, being willing to be severe with ourselves; not to be deceitful  in our own eyes; not to guard the outer act, but the inner thought;  not to study nor to be what _seems_, but what _is_.[59] This may seem  a long and roundabout way of learning to play music, but it is the  honest, straightforward way of going to the great masters whom we wish  to know.    In one of the books of the Greek general, Xenophon,[60] Socrates is  made to say that men do nothing without fire; and quite in the same  way we may learn nothing of each other, especially of those greater  than ourselves, without thought; which should be pure, strong,  inquiring, and kind. With this we may do all.    Thus far we have two principles. Let us review them:       I. Thoughts become actions.      II. Good music being the fruit of good thought can be played rightly        only by one who thinks good thoughts.    Now, is it not clear that this can come about only when we watch over  our own thoughts and govern them as if they were the thoughts of  others? And when we do not so much as _endure_ the thought of harm or  evil or wrong we shall be living in the spirit of the Roman lady whose  son's life was lived as his mother taught.          CHAPTER XVIII.    THE GLORY OF THE DAY.        \"Be not anxious about to-morrow. Do to-day's duty, fight today's    temptation; and do not weaken and disturb yourself by looking    forward to things which you cannot see, and could not understand if    you saw them.\"--_Charles Kingsley._    Nearly all of us have heard about the little child who one day planted  seeds and kept constantly digging them up afterward to see if they  were growing. No doubt the child learned that a seed needs not only  ground and care, but time. When it is put in the earth it begins to  feel its place and to get at home; then, if all is quite right,--but  not otherwise--it sends out a tiny rootlet as if it would say that it  trusts and believes the earth will feed that rootlet. And if the earth  is kind the root grows and finds a solid foothold. At the same time  there is another thing happening. When the seed finds it can trust  itself to root it feels no longer afraid to show itself. It goes down,  down quietly for a _firmer hold_, and upward feeling the desire for  light.    _A firm hold and more light_, we cannot think too much of what they  mean.    Every day that the seed pushes its tender leaves and stem upward it  has more and more to encounter. The rains beat it down; the winds bend  it to the very earth from which it came; leaves and weeds bury it  beneath their strength and abundance, but despite all these things, in  the face of death itself, the brave little plant strongly keeps its  place. It grows in the face of danger. But how? Day after day, as it  fights its way in the air and sunshine, blest or bruised as it may be,  the little plant never fails to keep at one thing. That is, to get a  firmer and firmer hold. From that it never lets go. Break its leaves  and its stem, crush it as you will, stop its upward growth even, but  as long as there is a spark of life in it there will be more roots  made. It aims from the first moment of its life to get hold strongly.    And it seems as if the plant has always a great motive. The moment it  feels it has grasped the mother-earth securely with its roots it turns  its strength to making something beautiful. In the air and light, in  the dark earth even, every part of the plant is seeking for the means  to do a wonderful thing. It drinks in the sunshine, and with the  warmth of it, _and to the glory of its own life_, it blossoms. It has  come from a tiny helpless seed to a living plantlet with the smallest  stem and root, and while the stem fights for a place in the air the  root never ceases to get a strong hold of the dear earth in which the  plant finds its home. Then when the home is firmly secured and the  days have made the plant stronger and more shapely, it forgets all the  rude winds and rain and the drifting leaves, and shows how joyful it  is to live _by giving something_.    Then it is clear that every hardship had its purpose. The rains beat  it down, but at the same time they were feeding it; the leaves dropped  about and covered it, but that protected its tenderness: and thus in  all the trials it finds a blessing. Its growth is stronger, and  thankful for all its life it seeks to express this thankfulness. In  its heart there is something it is sure. And true enough, out it comes  some day in a flower with its color and tenderness and perfume; all  from the earth, but taken from it by love which the plant feels for  the ground as its home.    We can see from this, that the beauty of a plant or of a tree is a  sign of its relation to the earth in which it lives. If its hold is  weak--if it loosely finds a place for a weak root--it lies on the  ground, helpless, strengthless, joyless. But firmly placed and feeling  safe in its security, it gives freely of its blossoms; or, year after  year, like a tree, shows us its wonderous mass of leaf, all of it a  sign that earth and tree are truely united.    It has been said, and no doubt it is true, that one who cares for  plants and loves them becomes patient. The plant does not hurry; its  growth is slow and often does not show itself; and one who cares for  them learns their way of being and of doing. The whole lesson is that  of allowing time, and by using it wisely to save it. The true glory of  a day for a plant is the air and sunlight and earth-food which it has  taken, from which it has become stronger. And every day, one by one,  as it proves, contributes something to its strength.    All men who have been patient students of the earth's ways have  learned to be careful, to love nature, and to take time. And we all  must learn to take time. It is not by careless use that we gain  anything, but by putting heart and mind into what must be done. When  heart and mind enter our work they affect time curiously; because of  the great interest we take in what we do time is not thought of; and  what is not thought of, is not noticed.    Hence, the value of time comes to this: to use any time we may have,  much or little, with the heart in the task. When that is done there is  not only better work accomplished but there are no regrets lingering  about to make us feel uncomfortable.    A practice hour can only be an hour of unwelcome labor when one thinks  so of it. If we go to the piano with interest in the playing we shall  be unconscious of time. Many men who love their labor tell of sitting  for hours at their work not knowing that hours have gone by.    If there is a love for music in any of us it will grow as a seed. And  as the seed needs the dear mother-earth, so the music needs the heart.  When it has taken root there and becomes firmer and firmer it will  begin to show itself outwardly as the light of the face. After it is  strong and can bear up against what assails it--not the wind and the  rain and the dry leaves, but discouragement and hard correction and  painful hot tears--then with that strength it will flourish.    Now, sometimes, in the days of its strength the music will seek far  more in its life, just as the plant seeks for more and blossoms. The  flower in the music is as great for all as for one. It is joy and  helpfulness. When for the love of music one seeks to do good then  music has borne its blossom.    Thus, by learning the life of a simple plant we learn the true mission  of the beautiful art of tone. It must put forth deeply its roots into  the heart that it may be fed. It must strive for strength as it grows  against whatever may befall it. It must use its food of the heart and  its strength for a pure purpose, and there is but one--to give joy.    This turns our thoughts to two things: First, to the men and women who  by their usefulness and labor increased the meaning of music. This is  the glory of their days. Second, we look to ourselves with feeble  hands and perhaps little talent, and the thought comes to us, that  with all we have we are to seek not our own glorification but the joy  of others.          CHAPTER XIX.    THE IDEAL.        \"Le beau est aussi utile que l'utile, plus peutetre.\"--_Victor    Hugo._    Mozart once had a friend named Gottfried von Jacquin, who was a man of  careful thought, and evidently a good musician,--for we are told that  a melody composed by him is frequently said, even to this day, to be  by Mozart."]]]
