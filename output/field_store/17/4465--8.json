Some generous spirits had brought chocolates and butter-scotch, which  they shared round, and Nora, the irrepressible, produced from her pocket  a mouth-organ, with which she proceeded to entertain the company, until  frantic raps from the next compartment made her aware that Miss Giles  heard and disapproved of her amateur recital. Naturally the talk was  largely about hockey and the chances of the match. It was known that the  Old Clintonians were a strong team, for most of them had been the crack  players of their school. To beat them would indeed be a feather in the  cap of the college.    \"Too good to come off!\" groaned Blossom gloomily.    \"Nonsense, you can't tell till you've tried! Make up your mind you're  going to win!\" said Nora indignantly. \"I shan't speak to you again if  you lose this match!\"    \"I'm only one out of eleven, please!\"    \"Well, I don't care! One who makes up her mind to fail can spoil  everything, and vice-versa, so just buck up and win!\"    The hockey ground was not very far from the station at Denscourt, and  when the Grovebury contingent arrived they found the Old Clintonians  ready and waiting for them. The eleven ran into the pavilion and took  off the long coats that had covered their gym costumes; then trooped out  on to the field, as neat and business-like looking a team as could be  imagined. Blossom, with her chums, Janie and Doreen, took good stock of  their opponents.    \"They're a strong set, and will take some beating,\" said Janie.    \"Rather!\" agreed Blossom. \"You may be sure we're not going to goal just  when we please.\"    \"They look topping sports!\" commented Doreen.    Everything was now in perfect order; the teams were placed, and the  umpire blew her whistle for the match to begin. As the account of such a  contest is always much more interesting when narrated by an actual  spectator, and as Nora wrote a long and accurate description of it  afterwards to a cousin at school in London, I will insert her letter,  and allow it to speak for itself.    (_This letter is an account of a real match, written by a real  schoolgirl._)         \"Grovebury College.         \"_My Dear Margaret_,         \"I simply must tell you about the hockey match we played last       Saturday!         \"The team played the Clinton High School Old Girls' Association at       Denscourt. Our girls were awfully keen to meet them, and were not       at all daunted by the fact that they were exceptionally strong.         \"About twenty of us went as spectators, and as we were about to set       off to the station with the Eleven, Rachel Grant, the Left Inner,       received a telegram, conveying news of her mother's serious       illness. To our great misfortune, she was obliged to go home at       once, and the first girl on the Reserve, Ingred Saxon, had to fill       her place.         \"Miss Giles, the Games Mistress, went on to get the tickets, and,       in spite of some delay, we managed to meet her in time to catch the       train. It is ten miles from here to Denscourt, and we arrived there       in about twenty minutes.         \"The field is not very far from the railway station. The team girls       were taken to the pavilion, and when they were ready, the captain       tossed up. Veronica Hall, the opposing captain, who is a tall       strong girl, and a fine hockey player, won the toss, and chose to       play against the wind for the first half. At exactly eleven, the       center forwards, Blossom and Veronica, began the bully-off. There       were three dull clashes as their sticks met, and then with a       dexterous stroke, Blossom passed the ball to her Right Inner, Janie       Potter. Before she could strike, the wing on the opposite side       captured the ball, and with a clean drive sent it spinning down the       field. It was soon stopped, however, by Doreen Hayward, the Right       Half, who, after successfully dribbling it past the enemy Inner,       sent it hard out to Aline West, the School Right Wing. Soon Aline       had the ball half-way up the field, but suddenly she stumbled, and       fell headlong to the ground. Before she could rise, the ball had       been sent to the rival Center Forward, who, with a magnificent hit,       drove it nearly into the goal-circle. There it was splendidly       blocked by Kitty Saunders, our Left Back, and quickly passed to       Evie Irving, the Left Wing. There was a brief, though fierce,       struggle for possession of the ball between the two wings, in which       Evie was victorious. She neatly avoided the Clinton Right Half, but       the ball went off the line. The opposing Half-back rolled in--to       her wing, as she thought--but with a swift movement, Ingred Saxon,       the Left Inner, reached the ball first, and taking it with her, ran       up the field like lightning. The Inner on the other side was an       equally fast runner, but Ingred easily evaded her opponent's       continued efforts to get the ball for some time.         \"'Oh! has she lost the ball?' 'No. Is she still flying on, the ball       before her?' 'Will she pass the rival back safely?' were the       questions which thronged my brain, nearly paralyzed with       excitement.         \"Not able to dribble the ball any farther, and being attacked by a       girl wearing the Clinton colors, Ingred hit the ball out to her       wing, who struck in to center again. The Left Back on the opposing       side stopped it just as it entered the goal-circle.         \"'Clear!' yelled one of the onlookers, unable to contain herself,       and with a fine stroke the Back sent the ball flying away to the       other side of the field. It went with such force that, although our       Right Back made an attempt to stop it, it raced past her stick and       over the outside line. After the roll-in, nearly all the play was       carried on practically in the center of the field. Each side       displayed some excellent passing, but when the whistle blew at half       time, neither had scored. By this time all the girls were hot and       panting, except the Goal-keepers, and were ready for the brief       rest. Our Eleven stood in a group together, sharing the lemons       which the Clinton girls provided, and discussing the events of the       last half-hour.         \"'Girls!' exclaimed Blossom, our captain 'we simply must win this       match! We shall have the wind against us the next half, but we are       not going to let things end in a victory for the Clintonians, or in       a draw either, are we?'         \"'No!' was the decided answer.         \"A few minutes later every one was in her place again, but of       course defending the other goal. Blossom and Veronica were once       more bullying-off. This time the latter was the quicker of the two,       for, with a clever hit, she succeeded in sending the ball away to       her Left Wing. The Clinton Left Wing began to dribble it along       towards the goal we were defending, and, when confronted by our       Right Half, passed it to her center. I almost screamed out to our       Center Forward not to let Veronica keep the ball, for I knew she       was a dangerous opponent. She was well up the field, and with a       neat turn of her stick sent the ball past our Right Back. There was       only one girl now to prevent her from getting a goal! Blossom was       now fast gaining, and then, just as Veronica came within shooting       distance, her foot slipped in the slimy mud, and she lost her       balance. Blossom was level with Veronica by this time, and before       the Clinton captain could steady herself, she had sent the ball far       away from the danger zone.         \"The play went on fairly evenly again until five minutes to twelve.       I felt wild with anxiety, and I am sure the others did too, for       there were only five minutes left.         \"The ball had just been sent over the line by one of the Clinton       girls, and our Left Half rolled in. The wing missed the bill, but       Ingred took it, and--well, I cannot tell you clearly what happened       after that. I still have in my mind the picture of Ingred, who, the       ball at her side, literally flew up the field, her feet scarcely       touching the ground. No one knows how she did it, but by some       marvellous playing she passed all her opponents, and shot the only       goal of the whole match just three seconds before the whistle blew       for 'Time.'         \"Of course Ingred was the heroine of the hour. As she was being       escorted to the pavilion, flushed but triumphant, Miss Giles said       to her: 'Well played! I am proud of you!'         \"Those few words of praise meant a good deal to Ingred, and we all       felt how well she deserved them, especially as it was only by       accident that she played in the team at all.         \"I do hope I have not tired you by going too fully into our match,       but I know you are interested in our school games, hockey in       particular. I will tell you about our later fixtures when I see you       at Christmas, so until then--Good-bye.         \"With love from your affectionate cousin,         \"Nora Clifford.\"          CHAPTER VIII    An Unpleasant Experience      The girls filed out from the hockey ground as speedily as possible.  There was a train due from Grovebury in about a quarter of an hour. They  walked to the station in groups, discussing details of the match as they  went. Ingred, Beatrice, and Verity happened to be blocked at the exit by  the Clintonian team, and were obliged to wait some minutes before they  could pass, and when at last they were through the gate, all their own  schoolfellows were disappearing up the road.    \"We"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#12)"],[1,"summer, to plan, to  work out your lists, to select materials, and make many of the things  just as you want them or even to hunt up the articles and purchase them,  while all the time delightful visions of trailing and camp life dance  before you, is to know the true joy of anticipation, and is great fun.      =Clothing=    Make your dress for the trail absolutely comfortable, not too heavy, too  tight, too hot, or too cool. No part of the clothing should bind or  draw.    Brown or dark gray are the best colors for the forest; avoid wearing  those which frighten the timid wild life, for you want to make friends  with the birds and animals, so do not wear metal buttons, buckles, or  anything that shines or sparkles.      =Underwear=    For girl campers the light-weight, pure-woollen underwear is best,  especially if you locate in the mountains, or the Canadian or Maine  forests. On cold days two light-weight union garments are warmer than  one of heavy weight. Wool is never clammy and cold, it absorbs  perspiration and when on the trail prevents the chilly feeling often  experienced when halting for a rest in the forest.    Union garments may be obtained in a variety of weights, and a one-piece  suit is the only garment necessary to wear under bloomers and middy when  at camp.    Leave corsets at home, they have no place in the outdoor life, and you  will be freer if you discard the dress skirt when at camp and on the  trail. Have your muscles free, be able to take in long, deep breaths, to  move readily all portions of your body, and not be hampered in any way  by ill-fitting, uncomfortable clothing. There must be unrestricted  freedom of arms and limbs for a girl to be able to use them easily in  climbing mountains or hills, scrambling over fallen trees, sliding over  rocks, jumping from stone to stone, or from root to half-sunken log on  wet trails of the forest.      =Stockings=    Select your stockings with care. Let them be of wool, strong, soft, and  absolutely satisfactory when the shoe is on. The aim of the entire camp  dress is to have it so comfortable and well adapted to outdoor life that  you will forget it; think no more of it than a bird does of its  feathers. When woollen stockings are worn, wet feet are not apt to give  one cold, for the feet do not become chilled even when it is necessary  to stand in the reedy edge of a mountain lake or stream. If, however,  you cannot wear wool, use cotton stockings. Remember that wool often  shrinks in the wash. Allow for this when purchasing goods, though it is  said, on reliable authority, that if laundered with care the garments  will not shrink.    When washing woollen underwear use very soapy, cool water (not icy) with  addition of a little borax, or ammonia, if you have either, and do not  rub soap directly on wool; it mats the little fibres and this causes  the wool to shrink. For the same reason avoid rubbing the garments if  possible during the cleansing process. All that is usually necessary is  to squeeze and souse them well, then rinse in water of the same  temperature; do not wring the things; squeeze them and hang them up to  dry. Changes of temperature in the water when washing wool will cause  the wool to shrink. To alternate between cold and warm, hot and lukewarm  water will surely cause the clothing to grow much smaller and stiffer;  keep both wash and rinse water either cold or lukewarm; cold is safer.    Allow no one to persuade you to take old clothes to camp; they will soon  need mending and prove a torment.      =Shoes=    Wear low-heeled, high-laced shoes of stout leather and easy fit. Make  them water-proof by giving the leather a good coat of hot, melted mutton  tallow, completely covering the shoes and working the tallow into all  crevices. Be sure to do this, as it is worse than useless to depend upon  rubber overshoes when trailing; sharp stones cut, and roots, twigs, and  underbrush tear the rubber, with the result that the overshoes soon fill  with water and your feet swim in little lakes. Test your shoes well  before taking them to camp, be perfectly satisfied that they are  comfortable and well-fitting, wear them steadily for one week or more.  It is very unwise to risk new shoes on the trail, and it is of the  utmost importance that the feet be kept in good condition. Be kind to  your feet.      =Camping Dress=    The most serviceable and practical dress for camping is a three-piece  suit, made of a fadeless, soft quality of gray or brown material.    [Illustration: DUFFEL-BAGS    LEGGIN    PONCHO    TRAILER'S BOOT    Trailers' outfits.]    The middy-blouse while loose can be well-fitting, with long sleeves  roomy enough to allow of pushing up above the elbow when desired. Sew  two small patch pockets high on the left breast--one for your watch, the  other for your compass; protect the pockets with flaps which fasten down  over the open top with dress snaps. On the right breast sew one  good-sized pocket.    In addition to these you will need one large pocket on both right and  left side of middy, below belt line, making in all three large and two  small pockets. The belt is held in place by sliding it through loops  sewed on the middy, one at the back and one on each side.    Make the skirt of this suit short enough for ease and of generous width,  not to draw at front, but give perfect freedom of the limbs. Have a seam  pocket in each side of the front breadth, and fasten the skirt down one  side from belt to hem. It can then be quickly removed and used as a cape  or a wind break when occasion requires. The bloomers, well-fitting and  comfortable, gathered below the knee with best quality of elastic, that  it may last, can have a deep pocket sewed across the front of each leg,  several inches conveniently below waist-line.      =Hat=    A soft, light-weight felt hat with brim sufficiently wide to shade the  eyes will prove the best head covering for the trail. Don't use hatpins;  your hat will cling to the head if you substitute a strip of woollen  cloth in place of the inside leather band. The clinging wool prevents  the hat from being readily knocked off by overhanging branches or blown  off on windy days.      =Check List of Apparel=    Go light when off for the woods, take with you only those things which  seem to be absolutely necessary; remember that you will carry your own  pack and be your own laundress, so hesitate about including too many  washable garments. Make out your list, then consider the matter  carefully and realize that every one of the articles, even the very  smallest, has a way of growing heavier and heavier and adding to the  ever-increasing weight of your pack the longer you walk, so be wise,  read over your list and cut it down, decide that you _can_ do without a  number of things thought at first to be indispensable.    In addition to your camp dress described, the following list forms a  basis to work upon, to be added to, taken from, or substitution made  according to location, climate, and nature of the country where you will  pitch camp:              One extra suit of wool underwear. Wash suit as            soon as changed.              One extra pair of stockings. Every morning put on            a fresh pair, washing the discarded ones the same            day.              One high-necked, long-sleeved, soft, woven            undershirt for cold days.              One extra thin middy-blouse for hot days.              Three pocket handkerchiefs, each laundered as soon            as discarded.              One kimono, soft, warm wool, buttoned down front,            not eider-down (it is too bulky), color brown or            dark gray.              One bathing-suit without skirt, made in one-piece,            loose, belted waist with bloomers; suit opened on            shoulders with strong button and buttonhole            fastenings.              One warm sweater with high turned-over collar and            sleeves good and long. On the trail carry your            sweater by tying the sleeves around your waist,            allowing the sweater to hang down at the back.              One pair of gloves, strong, pliable, easy-fitting            chamois, if you feel that you need them. The bare,            free hands are better.              One pair of strong, snug, well-fitting leggins            matching camp dress in color, with no buttons or            buckles to tangle on underbrush. The fastening can            be covered by smooth outer flap.              One pair of felt slippers or thick-soled moccasins            for tent.              Four extra strips of elastic for renewing those in            knees of bloomers.              One large, strong, soft silk or cotton            neckerchief, for protecting neck from sun, rain,            and cold, also good to fold diagonally and use for            arm sling or tie over hat in a hard wind; silk is            best.              Two head-nets if your stay is long, one if short,            to be worn in case of swarms of pestiferous flies            and mosquitoes. Especially needed for protection            from the midge, black-fly, etc., found in northern            forests and elsewhere during the spring and            through to the middle or last of July. Your net            can be of fine mesh bobbinet; if you have only            white, dye it black; all other colors are apt to            dazzle the eyes. The best material to use is black            Brussels net. Cut a strip of net long enough to            fit easily around your shoulders and allow of some            fulness. Take the measurement smoothly around the            shoulders with a piece of tape and add to this            about three-eighths of the entire length you have            just measured, which will give you the length            required. The width should be sufficient to allow            of the net reaching from base of hat crown across"]]]
