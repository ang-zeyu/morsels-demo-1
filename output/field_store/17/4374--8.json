In this present  life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we  have the least possible intercourse or communion with the body, and are  not surfeited with the bodily nature, but keep ourselves pure until the  hour when God himself is pleased to release us. And thus having got rid  of the foolishness of the body we shall be pure and hold converse with  the pure, and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere, which is  no other than the light of truth.' For the impure are not permitted to  approach the pure. These are the sort of words, Simmias, which the true  lovers of knowledge cannot help saying to one another, and thinking. You  would agree; would you not?    Undoubtedly, Socrates.    But, O my friend, if this is true, there is great reason to hope that,  going whither I go, when I have come to the end of my journey, I shall  attain that which has been the pursuit of my life. And therefore I go on  my way rejoicing, and not I only, but every other man who believes that  his mind has been made ready and that he is in a manner purified.    Certainly, replied Simmias.    And what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body,  as I was saying before; the habit of the soul gathering and collecting  herself into herself from all sides out of the body; the dwelling in  her own place alone, as in another life, so also in this, as far as she  can;--the release of the soul from the chains of the body?    Very true, he said.    And this separation and release of the soul from the body is termed  death?    To be sure, he said.    And the true philosophers, and they only, are ever seeking to release  the soul. Is not the separation and release of the soul from the body  their especial study?    That is true.    And, as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous contradiction  in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death, and  yet repining when it comes upon them.    Clearly.    And the true philosophers, Simmias, are always occupied in the practice  of dying, wherefore also to them least of all men is death terrible.  Look at the matter thus:--if they have been in every way the enemies of  the body, and are wanting to be alone with the soul, when this desire of  theirs is granted, how inconsistent would they be if they trembled and  repined, instead of rejoicing at their departure to that place where,  when they arrive, they hope to gain that which in life they desired--and  this was wisdom--and at the same time to be rid of the company of their  enemy. Many a man has been willing to go to the world below animated  by the hope of seeing there an earthly love, or wife, or son, and  conversing with them. And will he who is a true lover of wisdom, and is  strongly persuaded in like manner that only in the world below he can  worthily enjoy her, still repine at death? Will he not depart with joy?  Surely he will, O my friend, if he be a true philosopher. For he will  have a firm conviction that there and there only, he can find wisdom  in her purity. And if this be true, he would be very absurd, as I was  saying, if he were afraid of death.    He would, indeed, replied Simmias.    And when you see a man who is repining at the approach of death, is not  his reluctance a sufficient proof that he is not a lover of wisdom, but  a lover of the body, and probably at the same time a lover of either  money or power, or both?    Quite so, he replied.    And is not courage, Simmias, a quality which is specially characteristic  of the philosopher?    Certainly.    There is temperance again, which even by the vulgar is supposed to  consist in the control and regulation of the passions, and in the sense  of superiority to them--is not temperance a virtue belonging to those  only who despise the body, and who pass their lives in philosophy?    Most assuredly.    For the courage and temperance of other men, if you will consider them,  are really a contradiction.    How so?    Well, he said, you are aware that death is regarded by men in general as  a great evil.    Very true, he said.    And do not courageous men face death because they are afraid of yet  greater evils?    That is quite true.    Then all but the philosophers are courageous only from fear, and because  they are afraid; and yet that a man should be courageous from fear, and  because he is a coward, is surely a strange thing.    Very true.    And are not the temperate exactly in the same case? They are temperate  because they are intemperate--which might seem to be a contradiction,  but is nevertheless the sort of thing which happens with this foolish  temperance. For there are pleasures which they are afraid of losing; and  in their desire to keep them, they abstain from some pleasures, because  they are overcome by others; and although to be conquered by pleasure is  called by men intemperance, to them the conquest of pleasure consists in  being conquered by pleasure. And that is what I mean by saying that, in  a sense, they are made temperate through intemperance.    Such appears to be the case.    Yet the exchange of one fear or pleasure or pain for another fear or  pleasure or pain, and of the greater for the less, as if they were  coins, is not the exchange of virtue. O my blessed Simmias, is there not  one true coin for which all things ought to be exchanged?--and that  is wisdom; and only in exchange for this, and in company with this, is  anything truly bought or sold, whether courage or temperance or justice.  And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears  or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?  But the virtue which is made up of these goods, when they are severed  from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a shadow of virtue only,  nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her; but in the true  exchange there is a purging away of all these things, and temperance,  and justice, and courage, and wisdom herself are the purgation of them.  The founders of the mysteries would appear to have had a real meaning,  and were not talking nonsense when they intimated in a figure long ago  that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated into the world below  will lie in a slough, but that he who arrives there after initiation and  purification will dwell with the gods. For 'many,' as they say in the  mysteries, 'are the thyrsus-bearers, but few are the mystics,'--meaning,  as I interpret the words, 'the true philosophers.' In the number  of whom, during my whole life, I have been seeking, according to my  ability, to find a place;--whether I have sought in a right way or not,  and whether I have succeeded or not, I shall truly know in a little  while, if God will, when I myself arrive in the other world--such is my  belief. And therefore I maintain that I am right, Simmias and Cebes,  in not grieving or repining at parting from you and my masters in this  world, for I believe that I shall equally find good masters and friends  in another world. But most men do not believe this saying; if then I  succeed in convincing you by my defence better than I did the Athenian  judges, it will be well.    Cebes answered: I agree, Socrates, in the greater part of what you say.  But in what concerns the soul, men are apt to be incredulous; they fear  that when she has left the body her place may be nowhere, and that on  the very day of death she may perish and come to an end--immediately on  her release from the body, issuing forth dispersed like smoke or air  and in her flight vanishing away into nothingness. If she could only be  collected into herself after she has obtained release from the evils of  which you are speaking, there would be good reason to hope, Socrates,  that what you say is true. But surely it requires a great deal of  argument and many proofs to show that when the man is dead his soul yet  exists, and has any force or intelligence.    True, Cebes, said Socrates; and shall I suggest that we converse a  little of the probabilities of these things?    I am sure, said Cebes, that I should greatly like to know your opinion  about them.    I reckon, said Socrates, that no one who heard me now, not even if he  were one of my old enemies, the Comic poets, could accuse me of idle  talking about matters in which I have no concern:--If you please, then,  we will proceed with the inquiry.    Suppose we consider the question whether the souls of men after death  are or are not in the world below. There comes into my mind an ancient  doctrine which affirms that they go from hence into the other world, and  returning hither, are born again from the dead. Now if it be true that  the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other  world, for if not, how could they have been born again? And this would  be conclusive, if there were any real evidence that the living are only  born from the dead; but if this is not so, then other arguments will  have to be adduced.    Very true, replied Cebes.    Then let us consider the whole question, not in relation to man only,  but in relation to animals generally, and to plants, and to everything  of which there is generation, and the proof will be easier. Are not all  things which have opposites generated out of their opposites? I mean  such things as good and evil, just and unjust--and there are innumerable  other opposites which are generated out of opposites. And I want to show  that in all opposites there is of necessity a similar alternation;  I mean to say, for example, that anything which becomes greater must  become greater after being less.    True.    And that which becomes less must have been once greater and then have  become less.    Yes.    And the weaker is generated from the stronger, and the swifter from the  slower.    Very true.

Archibald's vessel was held up at Falmouth,  England, his papers seized and their contents cabled to the United  States. On September 8 Secretary Lansing instructed our ambassador at  Vienna to demand Dr. Dumba's recall and the demand was soon acceded to  by his government.    On December 4 Captain Karl Boy-Ed, naval attache of the German embassy  in Washington, was dismissed by our government for \"improper activity in  naval affairs.\" At the same time Captain Franz von Papen, military  attache of the embassy, was dismissed for \"improper activity in military  matters.\" In an intercepted letter to a friend in Germany he referred to  our people as \"those idiotic Yankees.\"    As a fitting wind-up of the year and as showing what the German promise  to protect liners amounted to, the British passenger steamer Persia was  sunk in the Mediterranean by a submarine December 30, 1915.    The opening of 1916 found the president struggling with the grave  perplexities of the submarine problem, exchanging notes with the German  government, taking fresh hope after each disappointment and endeavoring  by every means to avert the impending strife and find a basis for the  preservation of an honorable peace.    It was now evident to most thinking people that the apparent concessions  of the Germans were granted merely to provide them time to complete a  larger program of submarine construction. This must have been evident to  the president; but he appears to have possessed an optimism that rose  above his convictions.    Our government, January 18, put forth a declaration of principles  regarding submarine attacks and inquired whether the governments of the  allies would subscribe to such an agreement. This was one of the  president's \"forlorn hope\" movements to try and bring about an agreement  among the belligerents which would bring the submarine campaign within  the restrictions of international law. Could such an agreement have been  effected, it would have been of vast relief to this country and might  have kept us out of the war. The Allies were willing to subscribe to any  reasonable agreement provided there was assurance that it would be  maintained. They pointed out, however, the futility of treating on the  basis of promises alone with a nation which not only had shown a  contempt for its ordinary promises, but had repudiated its sacred  obligations.    A ray of hope gleamed across our national horizon when Germany, on  February 16, sent a note acknowledging her liability in the Lusitania  affair. But the whole matter was soon complicated again by the \"armed  ship\" issue. Germany had sent a note to the neutral powers that an armed  merchant ship would be treated as a warship and would be sunk on sight.  Secretary Lansing made the statement for this government that by  international law commercial ships have a right to arm themselves for  self-defense. It was an additional emphasis on the position that the  submarine campaign as conducted by Germany was simply piracy and had no  standing in international law. President Wilson, in a letter to Senator  Stone February 24, said that American citizens had a right to travel on  armed merchant ships, and he refused to advise them against exercising  the right.    March 24 the French steamer Sussex, engaged in passenger traffic across  the English channel, was torpedoed and sunk without warning. About  eighty passengers, including American citizens, were killed or wounded.    Several notes passed between our government and Germany on the sinking  of the Sussex and other vessels. Our ambassador at Berlin was instructed  to take energetic action and to insist upon adequate attention to our  demands. April 18 our government delivered what was considered an  ultimatum to the effect that unless Germany abandoned her methods of  submarine warfare, the United States would sever diplomatic relations.  The president addressed congress on the matter the following day.    Germany had not yet completed her program of submarine building and  thought it wise to temporize with the American government for a while  longer. May 4 she replied to the ultimatum of April 18, acknowledged the  sinking of the Sussex and in the main acceded to all the demands of the  United States. There were certain phases which indicated that Germany  wished to use this country as a medium for securing certain agreements  from the Allies. The president accepted the German conditions generally,  but made it clear in his reply that the conditions could not depend upon  any negotiations between this country and other belligerents. The  intimation was plain enough that the United States would not be a  catspaw for German aims.    Up to this time in the year 1916 the advantage in arms had been greatly  on the side of Germany and her allies. In January the British had  evacuated the entire Gallipoli peninsula and the campaign in Turkey soon  came to grief. Cettinje, the capital of Montenegro, had also fallen to  the Teutonic allies, and that country practically was put out of the  war.    The British had made important gains in the German colonies in Africa  and had conquered most of the Kamerun section there. Between February  and July the Germans had been battling at the important French position  of Verdun, with great losses and small results. Practically all the  ground lost was slowly regained by the French in the autumn. The  Russians had entered Persia in February, and April 17 had captured the  important city of Trebizond in Armenia from the Turks. But on April 29  General Townshend surrendered his entire British force to the Turks at  Kut el Amara, after being besieged for 143 days and finally starved into  submission.    Throughout the balance of the year the advantage was greatly on the side  of the Germans, for the latter part of the year saw the beginning of the  crushing of Roumania, which had entered the war August 27 on the side of  the Allies. Bucharest, the capital, fell to the Germans December 6;  Dobrudja, January 2, and Focsani, January 8 of the ensuing year, 1917.  The crushing of Roumania was accomplished almost entirely by treachery.  The Germans knew the plans of all the principal fortifications; the  strength and plans of the Roumanian forces, and every detail calculated  to be of benefit. The country had been honeycombed with their spies  prior to and during the war, very much as Russia had been. It is quite  evident that men high in the councils of the Roumanian government and in  full possession of the military secrets of the country were simply  disguised German agents.    Between July and November had occurred the great battles of the Somme  during which the Allies had failed to break the German lines. The  Austrians in June had launched a great attack and made much progress  against the Italians in the Trentino. The principal offsets to the  German gains during the last seven months of the year 1916 were the  Russian offensive in Volhynia and Bukovina, and the counter drive of the  Italians against the Austrians. The Russians captured Czernovitz June  17, and by the end of the month had overrun the whole of Bukovina. The  Italians drove out the Austrians between August 6 and September 1,  winning August 9 the important city and fortress of Gorizia.    Submarine incidents important to this government were not lacking during  the latter half of the year. The German submarine U-53 suddenly appeared  October 8 in the harbor at Newport, R.I. The commander delivered  letters for the German ambassador and immediately put to sea to begin  ravages on British shipping off the Nantucket coast. Among the five or  six vessels sunk was the steamer Stephano, which carried American  passengers. The passengers and crews of all the vessels were picked up  by American destroyers and no lives were lost. The episode, which was an  eight-day wonder, and resulted in a temporary tie-up of shipping in  eastern ports, started numerous rumors and several legal questions, none  of which, however, turned out finally to have been of much importance,  as U-53 vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, and its visit was not  succeeded by any like craft. It is not improbable that the purpose of  the German government in sending the boat to our shores was to convey a  hint of what we might expect if we should become involved with Germany.  October 28 the British steamer Marina was torpedoed with a loss of six  American lives.    The straining of President Washington's advice and the Monroe Doctrine  were again evident throughout the year. President Wilson in an address  before the League to Enforce Peace, May 27, had said that the United  States was ready to join any practical league for preserving peace and  guaranteeing the political and territorial integrity of nations.  November 29 our government sent a protest to Germany against the  deportation of Belgians.    Almost immediately upon the invasion of Belgium the German authorities,  in pursuance of their system of terrorization, shipped to Germany  considerable groups of the population. On October 12,1915, a general  order was issued by the German military government in Belgium providing  that persons who should \"refuse work suitable to their occupation and in  the execution of which the military administration is interested,\"  should be subject to one year's imprisonment or to deportation to  Germany. Numerous sentences, both of men and women, were imposed under  that order.    The wholesale deportation of Belgian workmen to Germany, which began"]]]
