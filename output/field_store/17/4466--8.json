The largest and most powerful tribe is that in the  neighbourhood of Timbuctoo, the Oulimad, answering, perhaps, to the  Sorghou of Caillie; and the smallest and weakest, the Tanelkum. But the  Tanelkums, if small in number, are great in pride, and consider  themselves a race of marabouts. They certainly make long prayers, and  several of them can write a little. The Turks treat the Tanelkums with  great consideration, and every year the Pasha of Mourzuk gives their  Sheikh a fine burnouse and other presents. They pay no impost, though  living in the Fezzan valleys. They are devoted to peaceful pursuits, and  are camel-drivers and small merchants. Formerly they were powerful; and  gave a sultan to the town of Ghat. About a century ago, their Sheikhs  and the greater part of the Tanelkums were destroyed by a razzia of the  Tibboos. They had then a town, which was situate in the Wady Esaiyen,  where there are still ruins to be seen, and which we passed near Berkat.    Of the Oulimad I know but little, except that they are exceedingly  turbulent, even ferocious, in the neighbourhood of Timbuctoo. They also  extend their razzias from Timbuctoo to the south-western frontiers of  the Asbenouee territories. A very short time ago they made a foray on  the Soudan route, between this and Damerghou. The Ghat Tuaricks I have  pretty well described.    The tribe of Janet has been mentioned frequently in this journal, from  the circumstance of their attempting to get up a razzia against the  expedition.    The Haghar are well known, even in Europe, for their freebooting  propensities. They lie between the Oulimad and the Azgher tribes  surrounding Tuat, and are some of them engaged in commerce.    The Sagamaram (or Sgamara) are an interesting small tribe, located in  the rocky valleys, along the line of the route from Aisou to Tuat. They  are mostly dressed in leathern clothes, and trade with Tuat, taking  their cloths and a fragrant herb called _debau_, which they exchange  against dates, &c. They likewise come to Aheer and Soudan, and fetch  slaves and goods for the souks of Tuat. They are a very pacific tribe,  not unlike the Tanelkums, but carrying on more commerce.    The Maghatah (or Maratah) are a thievish race, and have the vices of  their mothers, those peculiar to Soudan, as well as the more ferocious  traits of Berber bandits. Several of these people are in Janet.    In concluding these imperfect general observations on the state of Aheer  or Asben, I will only add that the country extends from north to south  eleven days' journey, or about two hundred and twenty miles (twenty  miles to the day); and east and west, eight days, or one hundred and  sixty miles. Aghadez, the largest town or city, stands, as has been  seen, alone; and may be considered as a kind of connecting link,  politically and otherwise, with the black countries to the south. I have  already endeavoured to explain the singular constitution of society in  this large but thinly-peopled tract. We observe there a curious  combination of the monarchical and patriarchal states, with a dash of  democracy into the bargain. Several times I have been reminded of  Homer's heroic age. The princes and the people seem alternately to  appear on the scene, exercising sovereign sway. The great Sultan is  elected from out of the country; but he is compelled to seek the  ratification of the chiefs, the elders, and the populace within. Then  there is the great chief of the Kailouees, whose town or camp is at  Asoudee; with Sultan Lousou, a most influential man; not to speak of the  great En-Noor himself, who has, perhaps, personally, the greatest  political weight of them all. Each of these great men is perpetually  surrounded by an army of retainers, dependants, and slaves; and public  affairs are transacted, partly according to some old routine, difficult  for a stranger to understand, partly after the fashion of \"Arabian  Nights,\" kings meeting casually at the head of great armies in some  poetical wilderness. All these chieftains are both pastors and  merchants. One of their chief articles of traffic is, I am sorry to say,  their unfortunate fellow-creatures. They are the greatest slave-dealers  in the Sahara; two-thirds of the whole commerce is in the hands of the  Kailouees. The Sultans levy duties likewise on the caravans that pass  through their territory--duties which, to our cost, we know to be  neither regular nor moderate; but they have no right to apply taxation  to their quasi-subjects. Sometimes, when they are \"hungry,\" they make a  razzia on a distant tribe, and find both slaves and cattle at their  disposal.    As might have been expected, the Kailouees--princes and people--are not  very refined in their ideas or luxurious in their habits. Their food  consists principally of the grains ghaseb and ghafouley, or guinea-corn.  They have also flocks and herds of sheep, camels, and bullocks; but the  bullocks are used chiefly for draft, and to carry goods from Aheer to  Soudan. Asses are exceedingly numerous, and likewise go to Soudan to  fetch guinea-corn. The population of Aheer, being scattered about in  small towns and villages, a few hours journey apart, these animals are  found very useful for the transport of the persons and effects of the  poor. The richer people have camels of the maharee species, like all the  Tuaricks; and in some respects it is the possession of this splendid  animal which distinguishes the Kailouee population from the people to  the south. For example, all their sports and pastimes would be exactly  Soudanese, were it not for the introduction of the maharee. On the  celebration of a wedding, the Kailouees ride round the groups of guests  on their silent-treading camels, which measure their movements to the  sound of a big rude drum. Such scenes would otherwise be perfectly  Nigritian. The men dance, flourishing their lances; and the slaves both  dance and sing. But I have already noted down all that I observed  remarkable in manners, and need not here repeat myself.    The great natural features of Asben, also, are doubtless by this time  impressed on the mind of the reader. They consist of a series of naked  granite rocks or mountains, some of them rising to upwards of three or  four thousand feet, ranging in every direction, with many isolated  peaks; and of picturesque valleys winding along between steep  precipices--threads of green, in which the tholukh and all species of  mimosa and acacia, with the souag and other trees, flourish in immense  growth, sometimes adorned by garlands and festoons of luxuriant  parasitical plants. Wild animals of various kinds range at will in  unfrequented places, but do not seem to excite much terror. There are  gardens and cornfields in the neighbourhood of some of the towns and  villages, the cultivation being kept up during the dry months by  irrigation; but only a few of the inhabitants, mostly slaves, cultivate  the soil. Besides the grains I have mentioned, a few vegetables,  principally onions, are produced. Date-palms bear fruit, which is good,  but will not keep.    I have already mentioned the chief manufactures of Aheer. They flourish  to the greatest extent in Aghadez; but Tintalous also has its artizans.  Working in leather was very popular during our stay, in consequence of  the presence of a noted charm-writer--bags being necessary. A good many  cunning blacksmiths ply their trade in various places.          CHAPTER V.

Our delay in the neighbourhood of Tintalous had been unexpectedly long,  and at times even the idea had crossed our minds that we should never be  allowed to depart at all. Often we had desired to start alone; but had  been withheld by our own prudence, as well as by the representations of  our host, the venerable Sheikh of Tintalous. We had come by degrees  scarcely to believe in the possibility of an advance, and to consider  ourselves as the prisoners of circumstances in this advanced part of the  Sahara, touching on the very borders of Central Africa. Now, however, we  saw, by the bustle of preparation in the town, that, whether the  salt-caravan arrived or not, we were to press forward. All night the  town was in a bustle. We rose before sunrise, to complete what packing  we had to do, and saw Jupiter and the moon in positions nearly  resembling the Ottoman device. It was windy all yesterday and this  morning, with a considerable degree of cold.    To my astonishment when we had taken leave of Tintalous, we pitched tent  after half an hour's journey. This was done, however, for a twofold  reason: 1st, to see that all was right, and that we had left nothing  behind; and 2d, to buy ghaseb,--a supply having arrived from Asoudee  just in time for us to carry with us. Never was there a more picturesque  caravan. Ladies on bullocks, children and women on donkeys, warriors on  maharees, merchants on camels, the Sultan's horse harnessed going alone,  and following steadily; goats and their kids, sheep, foals of camels,  &c. running or straggling along!
