I once knew an old horse-dealer who paid sixty  pounds for a _nokengro_ (a glandered horse) which had been powdered in  this way.\"    The Gipsy listened to me in great admiration.  About a week afterwards I  heard he had spoken of me as follows:--    \"Don't talk about knowing.  My rye knows more than anybody.  He can cheat  any man in England selling him a glandered horse.\"    Had this letter been strictly confined to the limits originally intended,  it would have spoken only of the sufferings of the family, the want of  money, and possibly, the acquisition of a new horse by the brother.  In  this case it bears a decided family-likeness to the following letter in  the German-Gipsy dialect, which originally appeared in a book entitled,  _Beytrag zur Rottwellischen Grammatik_, _oder Worterbuch von der Zigeuner  Spracke_, Leipzig 1755, and which was republished by Dr A. F. Pott in his  stupendous work, _Die Zigeuner in Europa und Asien_.  Halle, 1844.        GERMAN GIPSY.      MIRI KOMLI ROMNI,--Ertiewium Francfurtter wium te gajum apro Newoforo.

On the way  it did not go well with me.  Our men quarrelled together.  It was cold  and wet weather.  The children were ill.  That house into which we had  gone burnt down; our kid and the young calf run away.  The flax and hemp  and wool [which] the sister-in-law and step-daughter spun are also  burned.  In short, I say I became so poor that we all went naked.  I  thought of cutting wood and working by hand, or I should go into business  and sell something.  I think I will make my living so.  I was so treated  by the soldiers.  They fell on us, wounded many, three they killed, and I  was taken to prison to work for life.  Heaven preserve you in all things  from that into which I have fallen, and I remain thy husband unto death.    * * * * *    It is the same sad story in all, wretchedness, poverty, losses, and  hunger.  In the English letter there was a _chingari_--a shindy; in the  German they have a _tshinger_, which is nearly the same word, and means  the same.  It may be remarked as curious that the word _meraben_ at the  end of the letter, meaning death, is used by English Gipsies to signify  life as well.       \"Dick at the gorgios,        The gorgios round mandy;     Trying to take my meripon,        My meripon away.\"    The third letter is also in the German-Gipsy dialect, and requires a  little explanation.  Once a man named Charles Augustus was arrested as a  beggar and suspected Gipsy, and brought before Mr Richard Liebich, who  appears to have been nothing less in the total than the _Furstlich Reuss-  Plauenschem Criminalrathe und Vorstande des Furstlichen Criminalgerichts  zu Lobenstein_--in fact, a rather lofty local magistrate.  Before this  terrible title Charles appeared, and swore stoutly that he was no more a  Rommany chal than he was one of the Apostles--for be it remembered,  reader, that in Germany at the present day, the mere fact of being a  Gipsy is still treated as a crime.  Suddenly the judge attacked him with  the words--\"_Tu hal rom, me hom, rakker tschatschopenn_!\"--\"Thou art a  Gipsy, I am a Gipsy, speak the truth.\"  And Charles, looking up in  amazement and seeing the black hair and brown face of the judge, verily  believed that he was of the blood of Dom.  So crossing his arms on his  breast in true Oriental style, he salaamed deeply, and in a submissive  voice said--\"_Me hom rom_\"--\"_I am a_ Gipsy.\"    The judge did not abuse the confidence gained by his little trick, since  he appears to have taken Charles under his wing, employed him in small  jobs (in America we should say _chores_, but the word would be  frightfully significant, if applied to a Gipsy), {75} and finally  dismissed him.  And Charles replied Rommanesquely, by asking for  something.  His application was as follows:--        GERMAN GIPSY.      \"LICHTENBERG ANE DESCHE OCHDADO, _Januar_ 1859.    \"LADSCHO BARO RAI,--Me hunde dschinawe duge gole dui trin Lawinser mire  zelle gowe, har geas mange an demaro foro de demare Birengerenser.

CHARLES AUGUSTIN.\"        TRANSLATION.      \"LICHTENBERG, _January_ 18, 1859.    \"GOOD GREAT SIR,--I must write to you with these two or three words my  whole business (_gowe_, English Gipsy _covvo_, literally 'thing,') how it  happened to me in your town, by your servants (literally 'footmen').  When  I was arrested, your servants took my money away, and when I was freed  they took me out of prison.  I asked my money of them which I had given  up.  They said they had got none from me.  That I gave them my money they  cannot deny.  The said (literally, known) money is in a purse, a great  piece, red (and) old, three kreutzers, and a yellow piece of good-for-  nothing money.  I did not get my money, as the great God in heaven knows.  My great thanks for your goodness, I say.  The great God reward your good  heart with long healthy life, you and your whole family.  And if your  servants find my money, I beg they will send it to the town Naila, by the  post at once.  That I cursed you is not true; that my wife was drunk is  true.  The great God reward your good heart.  My thanks.  And I remain,  your obedient servant,    CHARLES AUGUSTIN.\"    Those who attempt to read this letter in the original, should be informed  that German Gipsy is, as compared to the English or Spanish dialects,  almost a perfect language; in fact, Pott has by incredible industry,  actually restored it to its primitive complete form; and its orthography  is now settled.  Against this orthography poor Charles Augustin sins  sadly, and yet it may be doubted whether many English tramps and beggars  could write a better letter.    The especial Gipsy characteristic in this letter is the constant use of  the name of God, and the pious profusion of blessings.  \"She's the  _blessing-est_ old woman I ever came across,\" was very well said of an  old Rommany dame in England.  And yet these well-wishings are not always  insincere, and they are earnest enough when uttered in Gipsy.          CHAPTER VI.  GIPSY WORDS WHICH HAVE PASSED INTO ENGLISH SLANG.

Though the language of the Gipsies has been kept a great secret for  centuries, still a few words have in England oozed out here and there  from some unguarded crevice, and become a portion of our tongue.  There  is, it must be admitted, a great difficulty in tracing, with anything  like accuracy, the real origin or identity of such expressions.  Some of  them came into English centuries ago, and during that time great changes  have taken place in Rommany.  At least one-third of the words now used by  Scottish Gipsies are unintelligible to their English brothers.  To  satisfy myself on this point, I have examined an intelligent English  Gipsy on the Scottish Gipsy vocabularies in Mr Simpson's work, and found  it was as I anticipated; a statement which will not appear incredible  when it is remembered, that even the Rommany of Yetholm have a dialect  marked and distinct from that of other Scotch Gipsies.  As for England,  numbers of the words collected by William Marsden, and Jacob Bryant, in  1784-5, Dr Bright in 1817, and by Harriott in 1830, are not known"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#12)"],[1,"boats trimmed with colored lanterns passed along the  river, there were fire-wheels on the bridge, water fireworks on the  river, and the quiet was disturbed alternately by the rockets and  music, and when the names of the Grand Duke and Duchess, crowned with  brilliant fire, appeared over the water, there was an involuntary  outburst of enthusiasm.

From this extensive paper it appears that the matters chiefly used in  tanning are the bark of the oak, containing from 6.04 to 4.37 per  cent. of tannin according to the season, that of willows, of the elm,  and the birch. The leaves of the arbutus, employed in the governments  of Kasan, Viatka, and Perm, contain about 16 per cent. of tannin,  while the root of wild sorrel (_Rumex acetosella_) contains 12 per  cent. For removing the hair from hides, a lye made from wood ashes is  still employed. The softening of the leather is effected by means of  the excrement of dogs, which acts on the leather by means of the  biliary acid present, which forms with soda a kind of soap. After  tanning, white Russia leather is coated with a mixture of tar and seal  oil. Black Russia leather is dyed with alum, extract of sanders, and  ferrous sulphate. Horse hides are tanned to a great extent for sole  leather.--_M. Ryloff._           *       *       *       *       *          IMPURITIES IN PHOTOGRAPHIC CHEMICALS, AND TESTS FOR SAME.
