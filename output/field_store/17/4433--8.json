The most important sub-division of words is the class called Adjectives,  which we propose to notice this evening. _Adjective_ signifies _added_  or _joined to_. We employ the term in grammar to designate that class of  words which are _added to nouns to define or describe them_. In doing  this, we strictly adhere to the principles we have already advanced, and  do not deviate from the laws of nature, as developed in the regulation  of speech.    In speaking of things, we had occasion to observe that the mind not only  conceived ideas of things, but of their properties; as, the hardness of  flint; the heat of fire; and that we spoke of one thing in reference to  another. We come now to consider this subject more at large.    In the use of language the mind first rests on the thing which is  present before it, or the word which represents the idea of that thing.  Next it observes the changes and attitudes of these things. Thirdly, it  conceives ideas of their qualities and relations to other things. The  first use of these words is to name things. This we call _nouns_. The  second is to express their actions. This we call _verbs_. The last is to  define or describe things. This we call _adjectives_. There is a great  similarity between the words used to name things and to express their  actions; as, builders build buildings; singers sing songs; writers write  writings; painters paint paintings. In the popular use of language we  vary these words to avoid the monotony and give pleasantness and  variety. We say builders _erect_ houses, barns, and other buildings;  singers perform pieces of music; musicians play tunes; the choir sing  psalm tunes; artists paint pictures.    From these two classes a third is derived which partakes somewhat of the  nature of both, and yet from its secondary use, it has obtained a  distinctive character, and as such is allowed a separate position among  the classes of words.    It might perhaps appear more in order to pass the consideration of  adjectives till we have noticed the character and use of verbs, from  which an important portion of them is derived. But as they are used in  connexion with nouns, and as the character they borrow from the verb  will be readily understood, I have preferred to retain the old  arrangement, and consider them in this place.    _Adjectives are words added to nouns to define or describe them._ They  are derived either, 1st, from nouns; as, _window_ glass, _glass_ window,  a stone house, building stone, maple sugar, sugar cane; or, 2d, from  verbs; as, a _written_ paper, a _printed_ book, a _painted_ house, a  _writing_ desk. In the first case we employ one noun, or the name of one  thing, to define another, thus giving it a secondary use. A _glass_  window is one made of glass, and not of any thing else. It is neither a  _board_ window, nor a _paper_ window. _Maple_ sugar is not _cane_  sugar, nor _beet_ sugar, nor _molasses_ sugar; but it may be _brown_  sugar, if it has been browned, or _white_ if it has been whit_ed_ or  whit_ened_. In this case, you at once perceive the correctness of our  second proposition, in the derivation of adjectives from verbs, by which  we describe a thing in reference to its condition, in some way affected  by the operation of a prior action. A _printed_ book is one on which the  action of printing has been performed. A _written_ book differs from the  former, in as much as its appearance was produced by writing and not by  printing.    In the definition or description of things, whatever is best understood  is employed as a definitive or descriptive term, and is attached to the  object to make known its properties and relations. Speaking of nations,  if we desire to distinguish some from others, we choose the words  supposed to be best known, and talk of European, African, American, or  Indian nations; northern, southern, eastern, or western nations. These  last words are used in reference to their relative position, and may be  variously understood; for we speak of the northern, eastern, western,  and southern nations of Europe, of Africa, and the world.    Again, we read of civiliz_ed_, half-civilized, and barbarous nations;  learned, unlearned, ignorant, and enlightened; rich, powerful,  enterprising, respected, ancient or modern, christian, mahomedan or  pagan. In these, and a thousand similar cases, we decide the meaning,  not alone from the word employed as an adjective, but from the subject  of remark; for, were we to attach the same meaning to the same word,  wherever used, we could not receive correct or definite impressions from  the language of others--our inferences would be the most monstrous. A  _great_ mountain and a _great_ pin, a _great_ continent and a _great_  farm, a _great_ ocean and a _great_ pond, a _great_ grammar and a  _great_ scholar, refer to things of very different dimensions and  character; or, as Mr. Murray would say, \"_qualities_.\" A mountain is  great by comparison with other mountains; and a pin, compared with other  pins, may be very large--exceeding great--and yet fall very far short of  the size of a very small mountain. A _small_ man may be a _great_  scholar, and a rich neighbor a poor friend. A sweet flower is often very  bitter to the taste. A _good_ horse would make a _bad_ dinner, but  _false_ grammar can never make _true_ philologists.    All words are to be understood according to their use. Their meaning can  be determined in no other way. Many words change their forms to express  their relations, but fewer in our language than in most others, ancient  or modern. Other words remain the same, or nearly so, in every position;  noun, adjective, or verb, agent or object, past or present. To determine  whether a word is an adjective, first ascertain whether it names a  thing, defines or describes it, or expresses its action, and you will  never be at a loss to know to what class it belongs.    The business of adjectives is twofold, and they may be distinguished by  the appellations of _defining_ or _describing_ adjectives. This  distinction is in many cases unimportant; in others it is quite  essential. The same word in one case may _define_, in others _describe_  the object, and occasionally do both, for we often specify things by  their descriptions. The learner has only to ascertain the meaning and  use of the adjective to decide whether it defines or describes the  subject of remark. If it is employed to distinguish one thing from the  general mass, or one class from other classes, it has the former  character; but after such thing is pointed out, if it is used to give a  description of its character or properties, its character is different,  and should be so understood and explained.    _Defining adjectives_ are used to _point out_, specify or distinguish  certain things from others of their kind, or one sort from other sorts,  and answer to the questions _which_, _what_, _how many_, or _how much_.    _Describing adjectives_ express the character and qualities of things,  and give a more full and distinct knowledge than was before possessed.    In a case before mentioned, we spoke of the \"Indian nations.\" The word  _Indian_ was chosen to specify or define what nations were alluded to.  But all may not decide alike in this case. Some may think we meant the  aborigines of America; others, that the southern nations of Asia were  referred to. This difficulty originates in a misapprehension of the  definitive word chosen. India was early known as the name of the south  part of Asia, and the people there, were called Indians. When Columbus  discovered the new world, supposing he had reached the country of India,  which had long been sought by a voyage round the coast of Africa, he  named it India, and the people Indians. But when the mistake was  discovered, and the truth fully known, instead of effecting a change in  the name already very generally understood, and in common use, another  word was chosen to distinguish between countries so opposite and _West_  India became the word to distinguish the newly discovered islands; and  as India was little better known in Europe at that time, instead of  retaining their old name unaltered, another word was prefixed, and they  called it _East_ India. When, therefore, we desire to be definite, we  retain these words, and say, East Indians and West Indians. Without this  distinction, we should understand the native people of our own country;  but in Europe, Asia, and Africa, they would think we alluded to those in  Asia. So with all other adjectives which are not understood. _Indian_,  as an adjective, may also be employed to _describe_ the character and  condition of the aborigines. We talk of an indian temper, indian looks,  indian blankets, furs, &c.    In writing and conversation we should employ words to explain, to define  and describe, which are better understood than those things of which we  speak. The pedantry of some modern writers in this respect is  ridiculous. Not satisfied to use plain terms which every body can  understand, they hunt the dictionaries from alpha to omega, and not  unfrequently overleap the \"king's english,\" and ransack other languages  to find an unheard of word, or a list of adjectives never before  arranged together, in so nice a manner, so that their ideas are lost to  the common reader, if not to themselves. This fault may be alleged  against too many of our public speakers, as well as the affected gentry  of the land. They are like Shakspeare's Gratiano, \"who speaks an  infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice; his reasons  are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek  all day ere you find them; and, when you have found them, they are not  worth the search.\" Such sentences remind us of the painting of the young  artist who drew the form of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#12)"],[1,"not abused  their liberty by revolting against their Master. Could not God have  created only angels of the good kind? If God could create angels who  have not sinned, could He not create men sinless, or those who would  never abuse their liberty by doing evil. If the chosen ones are  incapable of sinning in heaven, could not God have made sinless men upon  the earth?          LXXVII.--IT IS ABSURD TO SAY THAT GOD'S CONDUCT MUST BE A MYSTERY TO MAN,  AND THAT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO EXAMINE AND JUDGE IT.    We are told that the enormous distance which separates God from men,  makes God's conduct necessarily a mystery for us, and that we have no  right to interrogate our Master. Is this statement satisfactory? But  according to you, when my eternal happiness is involved, have I not the  right to examine God's own conduct? It is but with the hope of happiness  that men submit to the empire of a God. A despot to whom men are  subjected but through fear, a master whom they can not interrogate, a  totally inaccessible sovereign, can not merit the homage of intelligent  beings. If God's conduct is a mystery to me, it is not made for me. Man  can not adore, admire, respect, or imitate a conduct of which everything  is impossible to conceive, or of which he can not form any but revolting  ideas; unless it is pretended that he should worship all the things of  which he is forced to be ignorant, and then all that he does not  understand becomes admirable.    Priests! you teach us that the designs of God are impenetrable; that His  ways are not our ways; that His thoughts are not our thoughts; that it  is folly to complain of His administration, whose motives and secret  ways are entirely unknown to us; that there is temerity in accusing Him  of unjust judgments, because they are incomprehensible to us. But do you  not see that by speaking in this manner, you destroy with your own hands  all your profound systems which have no design but to explain the ways  of Divinity that you call impenetrable? These judgments, these ways, and  these designs, have you penetrated them? You dare not say so; and,  although you season incessantly, you do not understand them more than we  do. If by chance you know the plan of God, which you tell us to admire,  while there are many people who find it so little worthy of a just,  good, intelligent, and rational being; do not say that this plan is  impenetrable. If you are as ignorant as we, have some indulgence for  those who ingenuously confess that they comprehend nothing of it, or  that they see nothing in it Divine. Cease to persecute for opinions  which you do not understand yourselves; cease to slander each other for  dreams and conjectures which are altogether contradictory; speak to us  of intelligible and truly useful things; and no longer tell us of the  impenetrable ways of a God, about which you do nothing but stammer and  contradict yourselves.    In speaking to us incessantly of the immense depths of Divine wisdom, in  forbidding us to fathom these depths by telling us that it is insolence  to call God to the tribunal of our humble reason, in making it a crime  to judge our Master, the theologians only confess the embarrassment in  which they find themselves as soon as they have to render account of the  conduct of a God, which they tell us is marvelous, only because it is  totally impossible for them to understand it themselves.          LXXVIII.--IT IS ABSURD TO CALL HIM A GOD OF JUSTICE AND GOODNESS, WHO  INFLICTS EVIL INDISCRIMINATELY ON THE GOOD AND THE WICKED, UPON THE  INNOCENT AND THE GUILTY; IT IS IDLE TO DEMAND THAT THE UNFORTUNATE  SHOULD CONSOLE THEMSELVES FOR THEIR MISFORTUNES, IN THE VERY ARMS OF THE  ONE WHO ALONE IS THE AUTHOR OF THEM.    Physical evil commonly passes as the punishment of sin. Calamities,  diseases, famines, wars, earthquakes, are the means which God employs to  chastise perverse men. Therefore, they have no difficulty in attributing  these evils to the severity of a just and good God. However, do we not  see these plagues fall indiscriminately upon the good and the wicked,  upon the impious and the pious, upon the innocent and the guilty? How  can we be made to admire, in this proceeding, the justice and the  goodness of a being, the idea of whom appears so consoling to the  unfortunate? Doubtless the brain of these unfortunate ones has been  disturbed by their misfortunes, since they forget that God is the  arbiter of things, the sole dispenser of the events of this world. In  this case ought they not to blame Him for the evils for which they would  find consolation in His arms? Unfortunate father! you console yourself  in the bosom of Providence for the loss of a cherished child or of a  wife, who made your happiness! Alas! do you not see that your God has  killed them? Your God has rendered you miserable; and you want Him to  console you for the fearful blows He has inflicted upon you.    The fantastic and supernatural notions of theology have succeeded so  thoroughly in overcoming the simplest, the clearest, the most natural  ideas of the human spirit, that the pious, incapable of accusing God of  malice, accustom themselves to look upon these sad afflictions as  indubitable proofs of celestial goodness. Are they in affliction, they  are told to believe that God loves them, that God visits them, that God  wishes to try them. Thus it is that religion changes evil into good!  Some one has said profanely, but with reason: \"If the good God treats  thus those whom He loves, I beseech Him very earnestly not to think of  me.\" Men must have formed very sinister and very cruel ideas of their  God whom they call so good, in order to persuade themselves that the  most frightful calamities and the most painful afflictions are signs of  His favor! Would a wicked Genii or a Devil be more ingenious in  tormenting his enemies, than sometimes is this God of goodness, who is  so often occupied with inflicting His chastisements upon His dearest  friends?          LXXIX.--A GOD WHO PUNISHES THE FAULTS WHICH HE COULD HAVE PREVENTED, IS A  FOOL, WHO ADDS INJUSTICE TO FOOLISHNESS.    What would we say or a father who, we are assured, watches without  relaxation over the welfare of his feeble and unforeseeing children, and  who, however, would leave them at liberty to go astray in the midst of  rocks, precipices, and waters; who would prevent them but rarely from  following their disordered appetites; who would permit them to handle,  without precaution, deadly arms, at the risk of wounding themselves  severely? What would we think of this same father, if, instead of  blaming himself for the harm which would have happened to his poor  children, he should punish them for their faults in the most cruel way?  We would say, with reason, that this father is a fool, who joins  injustice to foolishness. A God who punishes the faults which He could  have prevented, is a being who lacks wisdom, goodness, and equity. A God  of foresight would prevent evil, and in this way would be saved the  trouble of punishing it. A good God would not punish weaknesses which He  knows to be inherent in human nature. A just God, if He has made man,  would not punish him for not being strong enough to resist his desires.  To punish weakness, is the most unjust tyranny. Is it not calumniating a  just God, to say that He punishes men for their faults, even in the  present life? How would He punish beings whom He alone could correct,  and who, as long as they had not received grace, can not act otherwise  than they do?    According to the principles of theologians themselves, man, in his  actual state of corruption, can do nothing but evil, for without Divine  grace he has not the strength to do good. Moreover, if man's nature,  abandoned to itself, of destitute of Divine help, inclines him  necessarily to evil, or renders him incapable of doing good, what  becomes of his free will? According to such principles, man can merit  neither reward nor punishment; in rewarding man for the good he does,  God would but recompense Himself; in punishing man for the evil he does,  God punishes him for not having been given the grace, without which it  was impossible for him to do better.          LXXX.--FREE WILL IS AN IDLE FANCY.    Theologians tell and repeat to us that man is free, while all their  teachings conspire to destroy his liberty. Trying to justify Divinity,  they accuse him really of the blackest injustice. They suppose that,  without grace, man is compelled to do evil: and they maintain that God  will punish him for not having been given the grace to do good! With a  little reflection, we will be obliged to see that man in all things acts  by compulsion, and that his free will is a chimera, even according to  the theological system. Does it depend upon man whether or not he shall  be born of such or such parents? Does it depend upon man to accept or  not to accept the opinions of his parents and of his teachers? If I were  born of idolatrous or Mohammedan parents, would it have depended upon me  to become a Christian? However, grave Doctors of Divinity assure us that  a just God will damn without mercy all those to whom He has not given  the grace to know the religion of the Christians.    Man's birth does not depend upon his choice; he was not asked if he  would or would not come into the world; nature did not consult him upon  the country and the parents that she gave him; the ideas he acquired,  his opinions, his true or false notions are the necessary fruits of the  education which he has received, and of which he has not been the  master; his passions and his desires are the necessary results of the  temperament which nature has given him, and of the ideas with which he  has been inspired; during the whole course of his life, his wishes and  his actions are determined by his surroundings, his habits, his  occupations, his pleasures, his conversations, and by the thoughts which"]]]
