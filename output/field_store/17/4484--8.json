So Dot did as she was told, and  screamed and cried like the most naughty of children; and the gasping  Kangaroo told her to go on doing so.    [Illustration: A LEAP FOR LIFE]    Then what seemed to Dot a very terrifying thing happened; for she soon  heard other cries mingle with hers. From the desolate morass, and from  the gully in darkness below, came the sound of a bellowing. She stopped  crying and listened, and could hear those awesome voices all around, and  the echoes made them still more hobgoblinish. The Kangaroo's eyes  brightened, as she restrained her panting, and listened also. \"Go on,\"  she said, \"we're safe now,\" so Dot made more crying, and her noises and  the others would have frightened anyone who had heard them in that  lonely place, with the wind storming in the trees, and the black clouds  flying over the moon. It frightened the Blackfellows directly.    They stopped in their headlong speed, shouting together in their shrill  voices, \"The Bunyip! the Bunyip!\" and they tumbled over one another in  their hurry to get away from a place haunted, as they thought, by that  wicked demon which they fear so much. At full speed they fled back to  their camp, with the sound of Dot's cries, and the mysterious bellowing  noise, following them on the breeze; and they never stopped running  until they regained the light of their camp fires. There they told the  \"Gins,\" in awe-struck voices, how it had been no Kangaroo they had  hunted, but the \"Bunyip,\" who had pretended to be one. And the Black  gins' eyes grew wider and wider, and they made strange noises and  exclamations, as they listened to the story of how the \"Bunyip\" had led  the huntsmen to that dreadful place. How it had torn one of the dogs to  pieces, and had leaped over the precipice into Dead Man's Gully, where  it had cried like a picaninny, and bellowed like a bull. No one slept in  the camp that night, and early next morning the whole tribe went away,  being afraid to remain so near the haunt of the dreaded \"Bunyip.\"    Dot saw the flight of the Blacks in the dim distance, and told the good  news to the Kangaroo, who, however, was too exhausted to rejoice at  their escape. She still lay where she had fallen, gasping, and with her  tongue hanging down from her mouth like that of a dog.    In vain Dot caressed her, and called her by endearing names; she lay  quite still, as if unable to hear or feel. Dot's little heart swelled  within her, and taking the poor animal's drooping head on her lap, she  sat quite still and tearless; waiting in that solitude for her one  friend to die--leaving her lonely and helpless.    Presently she was startled by hearing a brisk voice, \"Then it was a  human picaninny, after all! Well, my dear, what are you doing here?\" Dot  turned her head without moving, and saw a little way behind her a brown  bird on long legs, standing with its feet close together, with the  self-satisfied air of a dancing master about to begin a lesson.    Dot did not care for any other creature in the Bush just then but her  Kangaroo, and the perky air of the bird annoyed her in her sorrow.  Without answering, she bent her head closer down to that of her poor  friend, to see if her eyes were still shut, and wondered if they would  ever open and look bright and gentle again.    The little brown bird strutted with an important air to where it had a  better view of Dot and her companion, and eyed them both in the same  perky manner. \"Friend Kangaroo's in a bad way,\" it said; \"why don't you  do something, sensible, instead of messing about with its head?\"    \"What can I do?\" whimpered Dot.    \"Give it water, and damp its skin, of course,\" said the little Bird,  contemptuously. \"What fools Humans are,\" it exclaimed to itself. \"And I  suppose you will tell me there is no water here, when all the time you  are sitting on a spring.\"    \"But I'm sitting on grass,\" said Dot, now fully attentive to the bird's  remarks.    \"Well, booby,\" sneered the bird, \"and under the grass is wet moss,  which, if you make a hole in it, will fill with water. Why, I'd do it  myself, in a moment, only your claws are better suited for the purpose  than mine. Set about it at once!\" it said sharply.    In an instant Dot did what the bird directed, and thrust her little  hands into the soft grass roots and moss, out of which water pressed,  as if from a sponge. She had soon made a little hole, and the most  beautiful clear water welled up into it at once. Then, in the hollows of  her little hands, she collected it, and dashed it over the Kangaroo's  parched tongue, and, further instructed by the kindly though rude little  bird, she had soon well wetted the suffering animal's fur. Gradually the  breathing of the Kangaroo became less of an effort, her tongue moistened  and returned to the mouth, and at last Dot saw with joy the brown eyes  open, and she knew that her good friend was not going to die, but would  get well again.    Whilst all this took place, the little brown bird stood on one leg, with  its head cocked on one side, watching the exhausted Kangaroo's recovery  with a comic expression of curiosity and conceit. When it spoke to Dot,  it did so without any attempt at being polite, and Dot thought it the  strangest possible creature, because it was really very kind in helping  her to save the Kangaroo's life, and yet it seemed to delight in  spoiling its kindheartedness by its rudeness. Afterwards the Kangaroo  told her that the little Bittern is a really tender-hearted fellow, but  he has an idea that kindness in rather small creatures provokes the  contempt of the big ones. As he always wants to be thought a bigger bird  than he is, he pretends to be hard-hearted by being rough; consequently,  nearly all the Bush creatures simply regard him as a rude little bird,  because bad manners are no proof of being grown-up; rather the contrary.    \"How do you feel now?\" asked the Bittern, as the Kangaroo presently  struggled up and squatted rather feebly on her haunches, looking about  in a somewhat dazed way.    \"I'm better now,\" said the Kangaroo, \"but, dear me! how everything seems  to dance up and down!\" She shut her eyes, for she felt giddy.    \"That was rather a good jump of yours,\" said the Bittern, patronizingly,  as if jumps for life like that of Dot's Kangaroo were made every day,  and he was a judge of them!    \"Ah! I remember!\" said the Kangaroo, opening her eyes again and looking  round. \"Where is Dot?\"    \"Umph! that silly!\" exclaimed the Bittern, as Dot came forward, and she  and the Kangaroo rejoiced over each other's safety. \"Much good she'd  have been to you with the Blacks, and their dogs after you, if we  Bitterns hadn't played that old trick of ours of scaring them with our  big voices. He! he! he!\" it chuckled, \"how they did run when we tuned  up! They thought the Bunyip had got them this time. Didn't we laugh!\"    \"It was very good of you,\" said the Kangaroo gratefully, \"and it is not  the first time you have saved Kangaroos by your cleverness. I didn't  know you Bitterns were near, so I told Dot to make a noise in the hope  of frightening them.\"    The Bittern was really touched by the Kangaroo's gratitude, and was  delighted at being called clever, so it became still more ungracious.  \"You needn't trouble me with thanks,\" it said indifferently, \"we didn't  do it to save you, but for our own fun. As for that little stupid,\" it  continued, with a nod of the head towards Dot, \"her squeals were no more  good than the squeak of a tree frog in a Bittern's beak.\"    \"But you were very kind,\" said Dot, \"and showed me how to get water to  save Kangaroo's life.\"    The Bittern was greatly pleased at this praise, and in consequence it  got still ruder, and making a face at Dot, exclaimed, \"yah!\" and stalked  off. But when it had gone a few steps it turned round and said to the  Kangaroo, roughly, \"If you hop that way, keeping to the side of the  sedges, and go half a dozen small hops beyond that white gum tree,  you'll find a little cave. It's dry and warm, and good enough for  Kangaroos.\" And without waiting for thanks for this last kind act, it  spread its wings and flew away.          CHAPTER IX      The Kangaroo, hopping very weakly, and little Dot trudging over the oozy  ground, followed the Bittern's directions and found the cave, which  proved a very snug retreat. Here they lay down together, full of  happiness at their escape, and being worn out with fatigue and  excitement, they were soon fast asleep.    The next day, before the sun rose, the Bittern visited the cave. \"Hullo,  you precious lazy pair! I've been over there,\" and it tossed its beak in  the direction of the Black's camp. \"They're off northward. Too  frightened to stay. I thought you might like the news brought you, since  you're too lazy to get it for yourselves!\" and off it went again without  saying good-bye.    \"Now isn't he a kind little fellow?\" said the Kangaroo. \"That's his way  of telling us that we are safe.\"    \"Thanks, Bittern! thanks!\" they both cried, but the creamy brown bird  paid no attention to their gratitude: it seemed absorbed in looking for  frogs on its way.    All that day the Kangaroo and Dot stayed near the cave, so that the poor  animal might get quite well again. The Kangaroo said she did not know  that part of the country, and so she had better get her legs again  before they faced fresh dangers. Neither of them was so bright and merry  as before. The weather was showery, and Dot kept thinking that perhaps  she would never get home, now she had been so long away, and she kept  remembering the time when the little boy was lost and everyone's  sadness.    The Kangaroo too seemed melancholy. \"What makes you sad?\" asked Dot.    \"I am thinking of the last time before this that I was hunted. It was  then I lost my baby Kangaroo,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#12)"],[1," though in composition and command of  line he did not reach up to Masaccio. He was among the first of the  painters to take the individual faces of those about him as models for  his sacred characters, and clothe them in contemporary costume. Piety  is not very pronounced in any of his works, though he is not without  imagination and feeling, and there is in his women a charm of  sweetness. His tendency was to materialize the sacred characters.    With Filippino (1457?-1504), Botticelli (1446-1510), and Ghirlandajo  (1449-1494) we find a degree of imagination, culture, and independence  not surpassed by any of the Early Florentines. Filippino modelled his  art upon that of his father, Fra Filippo, and was influenced by  Botticelli. He was the weakest of the trio, without being by any means  a weak man. On the contrary, he was an artist of fine ability, much  charm and tenderness, and considerable style, but not a great deal of  original force, though occasionally doing forceful things. Purity in  his type and graceful sentiment in pose and feature seem more  characteristic of his work. Botticelli, even, was not so remarkable  for his strength as for his culture, and an individual way of looking  at things. He was a pupil of Fra Filippo, a man imbued with the  religious feeling of Dante and Savonarola, a learned student of the  antique and one of the first to take subjects from it, a severe nature  student, and a painter of much technical skill. Religion, classicism,  and nature all met in his work, but the mingling was not perfect.  Religious feeling and melancholy warped it. His willowy figures,  delicate and refined in drawing, are more passionate than powerful,  more individual than comprehensive, but they are nevertheless very  attractive in their tenderness and grace.    Without being so original or so attractive an artist as Botticelli,  his contemporary, Ghirlandajo, was a stronger one. His strength came  more from assimilation than from invention. He combined in his work  all the art learning of his time. He drew well, handled drapery simply  and beautifully, was a good composer, and, for Florence, a good  colorist. In addition, his temperament was robust, his style  dignified, even grand, and his execution wonderfully free. He was the  most important of the fifteenth-century technicians, without having  any peculiar distinction or originality, and in spite of being rather  prosaic at times.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--FRANCESCA. DUKE OF URBINO. UFFIZI.]    Verrocchio (1435-1488) was more of a sculptor than a painter, but in  his studio were three celebrated pupils--Perugino, Leonardo da Vinci,  and Lorenzo di Credi--who were half-way between the Early and the High  Renaissance. Only one of them, Leonardo, can be classed among the  High Renaissance men. Perugino belongs to the Umbrian school, and  Lorenzo di Credi (1450-1537), though Florentine, never outgrew the  fifteenth century. He was a pure painter, with much feeling, but weak  at times. His drawing was good, but his painting lacked force, and he  was too pallid in flesh color. There is much detail, study, and  considerable grace about his work, but little of strength. Piero di  Cosimo (1462-1521) was fond of mythological and classical studies, was  somewhat fantastic in composition, pleasant in color, and rather  distinguished in landscape backgrounds. His work strikes one as  eccentric, and eccentricity was the strong characteristic of the man.    UMBRIAN AND PERUGIAN SCHOOLS: At the beginning of the fifteenth  century the old Siennese school founded by Duccio and the Lorenzetti  was in a state of decline. It had been remarkable for intense  sentiment, and just what effect this sentiment of the old Siennese  school had upon the painters of the neighboring Umbrian school of the  early fifteenth century is a matter of speculation with historians. It  must have had some, though the early painters, like Ottaviano Nelli,  do not show it. That which afterward became known as the Umbrian  sentiment probably first appeared in the work of Niccolo da Foligno  (1430?-1502), who was probably a pupil of Benozzo Gozzoli, who was, in  turn, a pupil of Fra Angelico. That would indicate Florentine  influence, but there were many influences at work in this upper-valley  country. Sentiment had been prevalent enough all through Central  Italian painting during the Gothic age--more so at Sienna than  elsewhere. With the Renaissance Florence rather forsook sentiment for  precision of forms and equilibrium of groups; but the Umbrian towns  being more provincial, held fast to their sentiment, their detail, and  their gold ornamentation. Their influence upon Florence was slight,  but the influence of Florence upon them was considerable. The larger  city drew the provincials its way to learn the new methods. The  result was a group of Umbro-Florentine painters, combining some  up-country sentiment with Florentine technic. Gentile da Fabriano,  Niccolo da Foligno, Bonfiglio (1425?-1496?), and Fiorenzo di Lorenzo  (1444?-1520) were of this mixed character.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--SIGNORELLI. THE CURSE (DETAIL). ORVIETO.]    The most positive in methods among the early men was Piero della  Francesca (1420?-1492). Umbrian born, but Florentine trained, he  became more scientific than sentimental, and excelled as a craftsman.  He knew drawing, perspective, atmosphere, light-and-shade in a way  that rather foreshadowed Leonardo da Vinci. From working in the  Umbrian country his influence upon his fellow-Umbrians was large. It  showed directly in Signorelli (1441?-1523), whose master he was, and  whose style he probably formed. Signorelli was Umbrian born, like  Piero, but there was not much of the Umbrian sentiment about him. He  was a draughtsman and threw his strength in line, producing athletic,  square-shouldered figures in violent action, with complicated  foreshortenings quite astonishing. The most daring man of his time, he  was a master in anatomy, composition, motion. There was nothing select  about his type, and nothing charming about his painting. His color was  hot and coarse, his lights lurid, his shadows brick red. He was,  however, a master-draughtsman, and a man of large conceptions and  great strength. Melozzo da Forli (1438-1494), of whom little is known,  was another pupil of Piero, and Giovanni Santi (1435?-1494), the  father of Raphael, was probably influenced by both of these last  named.    The true descent of the Umbrian sentiment was through Foligno and  Bonfiglio to Perugino (1446-1524). Signorelli and Perugino seem  opposed to each other in their art. The first was the forerunner of  Michael Angelo, the second was the master of Raphael; and the  difference between Michael Angelo and Raphael was, in a less varied  degree, the difference between Signorelli and Perugino. The one showed  Florentine line, the other Umbrian sentiment and color. It is in  Perugino that we find the old religious feeling. Fervor, tenderness,  and devotion, with soft eyes, delicate features, and pathetic looks  characterized his art. The figure was slight, graceful, and in pose  sentimentally inclined to one side. The head was almost affectedly  placed on the shoulders, and the round olive face was full of wistful  tenderness. This Perugino type, used in all his paintings, is well  described by Taine as a \"body belonging to the Renaissance containing  a soul that belonged to the Middle Ages.\" The sentiment was more  purely human, however, than in such a painter, for instance, as Fra  Angelico. Religion still held with Perugino and the Umbrians, but  even with them it was becoming materialized by the beauty of the  world about them.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--PERUGINO. MADONNA, SAINTS, AND ANGELS.  LOUVRE.]    As a technician Perugino was excellent. There was no dramatic fire and  fury about him. The composition was simple, with graceful figures in  repose. The coloring was rich, and there were many brilliant effects  obtained by the use of oils. He was among the first of his school to  use that medium. His friend and fellow-worker, Pinturricchio  (1454-1513), did not use oils, but was a superior man in fresco. In  type and sentiment he was rather like Perugino, in composition a  little extravagant and huddled, in landscape backgrounds quite  original and inventive. He never was a serious rival of Perugino,  though a more varied and interesting painter. Perugino's best pupil,  after Raphael, was Lo Spagna (?-1530?), who followed his master's  style until the High Renaissance, when he became a follower of  Raphael.    SCHOOLS OF FERRARA AND BOLOGNA: The painters of Ferrara, in the  fifteenth century, seemed to have relied upon Padua for their  teaching. The best of the early men was Cosimo Tura (1430-1495), who  showed the Paduan influence of Squarcione in anatomical insistences,  coarse joints, infinite detail, and fantastic ornamentation. He was  probably the founder of the school in which Francesco Cossa (fl.  1435-1480), a _naif_ and strong, if somewhat morbid painter, Ercole di  Giulio Grandi (fl. 1465-1535), and Lorenzo Costa (1460?-1535) were the  principal masters. Cossa and Grandi, it seems, afterward removed to  Bologna, and it was probably their move that induced Lorenzo Costa to  follow them. In that way the Ferrarese school became somewhat  complicated with the Bolognese school, and is confused in its history  to this day. Costa was not unlikely the real founder, or, at the  least, the strongest influencer of the Bolognese school. He was a  painter of a rugged, manly type, afterward tempered by Southern  influences to softness and sentiment. This was the result of Paduan  methods meeting at Bologna with Umbrian sentiment.    The Perugino type and influence had found its way to Bologna, and  showed in the work of Francia (1450-1518), a contemporary and  fellow-worker with Costa.
