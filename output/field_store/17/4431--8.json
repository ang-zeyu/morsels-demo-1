You now have the  most perfect, sweetest harmony in the chord of C (G, C, E) that can be  produced; all its members being absolutely perfect; not a wave to mar  its serene purity. But, now, upon sounding this E with the A below it,  you will find it so flat that the dissonance is unbearable. Try the  minor chord of A (A-C-E) and you will hear the rasping, throbbing  beats of the too greatly flattened fifth.    So, you see, we are confronted with a difficulty. If we tune our  fifths perfect (in which case our fourths would also be perfect), our  thirds are so sharp that the ear will not tolerate them; and, if we  tune our thirds low enough to banish all beats, our fifths are  intolerably flat.    The experiment above shows us beautifully the prominent inconsistency  of our scale. We have demonstrated, that if we tune the members of the  chord of C so as to get absolutely pure harmony, we could not use the  chord of A on account of the flat fifth E, which did duty so perfectly  as third in the chord of C.    There is but one solution to this problem: Since we cannot tune either  the fifth or the third perfect, we must compromise, we must strike the  happy medium. So we will proceed by a method that will leave our  fifths flatter than perfect, but not so much as to make them at all  displeasing, and that will leave our thirds sharper than perfect, but  not intolerably so.    We have, thus far, spoken only of the octave, fifth and third. The  inquisitive student may, at this juncture, want to know something  about the various other intervals, such as the minor third, the major  and minor sixth, the diminished seventh, etc. But please bear in mind  that there are many peculiarities in the tempered scale, and we are  going to have you fully and explicitly informed on every point, if you  will be content to absorb as little at a time as you are prepared to  receive. While it may seem to us that the tempered scale is a very  complex institution when viewed as a specific arrangement of tones  from which we are to derive all the various kinds of harmony, yet,  when we consider that the chromatic scale is simply a series of twelve  half-steps--twelve perfectly similar intervals--it seems very simple.    Bear in mind that the two cardinal points of the system of tuning are:        1. All octaves shall be tuned perfect.        2. All fifths shall be tuned a little flatter than perfect.    You have seen from Lesson VIII that by this system we begin upon a  certain tone and by a circle of twelve fifths cover every chromatic  tone of the scale, and that we are finally brought around to a fifth,  landing upon the tone upon which we started.    So you see there is very little to remember. Later on we will speak of  the various other intervals used in harmony: not that they form any  prominent part in scale forming, for they do not; but for the purpose  of giving the learner a thorough understanding of all that pertains to  the establishing of a correct equal temperament.    If the instruction thus far is understood and carried out, and the  student can properly tune fifths and octaves, the other intervals will  take care of themselves, and will take their places gracefully in any  harmony in which they are called upon to take part; but if there is a  single instance in which an octave or a fifth is allowed to remain  untrue or untempered, one or more chords will show it up. It may  manifest itself in one chord only. A tone may be untrue to our  tempered scale, and yet sound beautifully in certain chords, but there  will always be at least one in which it will \"howl.\" For instance, if  in the seventh step of our system, we tune E a little too flat, it  sounds all the better when used as third in the chord of C, as we have  shown in the experiment mentioned on page 94 of this lesson. But, if  the remainder of the temperament is accurate, this E, in the chord in  which E acts as tonic or fundamental, will be found to be too flat,  and its third, G sharp, will demonstrate the fact by sounding too  sharp.    The following suggestions will serve you greatly in testing: When a  third sounds disagreeably sharp, one or more fifths have not been  sufficiently flattened.[E] While it is true that thirds are tuned  sharp, there is a limit beyond which we cannot go, and this excessive  sharpness of the third is the thing that tuners always listen for.        [E] In making these suggestions, no calculation is made for the      liability of the tones tuned to fall. This often happens, in which      case your first test will display a sharp third. In cases like this      it is best to go on through, taking pains to temper carefully, and      go all over the temperament again, giving all the strings an equal      chance to fall. If the piano is very bad, you may have to bring up      the unisons roughly, inuring this portion of the instrument to the      increased tension, when you may again place your continuous mute and      set your temperament with more certainty.    The fundamental sounds better to the ear when too sharp. The reason  for this is the same as has already been explained above; namely, if  the fundamental is too sharp the third will be less sharp to it, and,  therefore, nearer perfect.    After you have gone all over your temperament, test every member of  the chromatic scale as a fundamental of a chord, as a third, and as a  fifth. For instance: try middle C as fundamental in the chord of C  (G-C-E or E-G-C or C-E-G). Then try it as third in the chord A flat (E  flat-A flat-C or C-E flat-A flat or A flat-C-E flat). Then try it as  fifth in the chord of F (C-F-A or A-C-F or F-A-C). Take G likewise and  try it as fundamental in the chord of G in its three positions, then  try it as a third in the chord of E flat, then as fifth in the chord  of C. In like manner try every tone in this way, and if there is a  falsely tempered interval in the scale you will be sure to find it.    You now understand that the correctness of your temperament depends  entirely upon your ability to judge the degree of flatness of your  fifths; provided, of course, that the strings stand as tuned. We have  told you something about this, but you may not be able at once to  judge with sufficient accuracy to insure a good temperament. Now, we  have said, let the fifths beat a little more slowly than once a  second; but the question crops up, How am I to judge of a second of  time? The fact is that a second of time is quickly learned and more  easily estimated, perhaps, than any other interval of time; however,  we describe here a little device which will accustom one to estimate  it very accurately in a short time. The pendulum oscillates by an  invariable law which says that a pendulum of a certain length will  vibrate always in a corresponding period of time, whether it swings  through a short arc or a long one. A pendulum thirty-nine and a half  inches long will vibrate seconds by a single swing; one nine and  seven-eighths inches long will vibrate seconds at the double swing,  or the to-and-fro swing. You can easily make one by tying any little  heavy article to a string of either of these lengths. Measure from the  center of such heavy article to the point of contact of the string at  the top with some stationary object. This is a sure guide. Set the  pendulum swinging and count the vibrations and you will soon become  quite infallible. Having acquired the ability to judge a second of  time you can go to work with more confidence.    Now, as a matter of fact, in a scale which is equally tempered, no two  fifths beat exactly alike, as the lower a fifth, the slower it should  beat, and thus the fifths in the bass are hardly perceptibly flat,  while those in the treble beat more rapidly. For example, if a certain  fifth beat once a second, the fifth an octave higher will beat twice a  second, and one that is two octaves higher will beat four times a  second, and so on, doubling the number of beats with each ascending  octave.    In a subsequent lesson, in which we give the mathematics of the  temperament, these various ratios will be found accurately figured  out; but for the present let us notice the difference between the  actual tempered scale and the exact mathematical scale in the point of  the flattening of the fifth. Take for example 1C, and for convenience  of figuring, say it vibrates 128 per second. The relation of a  fundamental to its fifth is that of 2 to 3. So if 128 is represented  as 2, we think of it as 2 times 64. Then with another 64 added, we  have 192, which represents 3. In other words, a fundamental has just  two-thirds of the number of vibrations per second that its fifth has,  in the exact scale. This would mean a fifth in which there would be no  beats. Now in the tempered scale we find that G vibrates 191.78  instead of 192; so we can easily see how much variation from the  mathematical standard there is in this portion of the instrument. It  is only about a fourth of a vibration. This would mean that, in this  fifth we would hear the beats a little slower than one per second.  Take the same fifth an octave higher and take 2C as fundamental, which  has 256 for its vibration number. The G, fifth above, should vibrate  384, but in the tempered scale it beats but 383.57, almost half a  vibration flat. This would give nearly 2 beats in 3 seconds.    These figures simply represent to the eye the ratios of these sounds,  and it is not supposed that a tuner is to attain to such a degree of  accuracy, but he should strive to arrive as near it as possible.    It is well for the student to practice temperament setting and regular  tuning now if he can do so. After getting a good temperament, proceed  to tune by octaves upward, always testing the tone tuned as a fifth  and third until his ear becomes sufficiently true on the octave that  testing otherwise is unnecessary.

Some things considered essential at the home table have fallen into  disuse in camp. It is pardonable, and perhaps best, to bring on whatever  you have cooked in the dish that it is cooked in, so as to prevent its  cooling off.    You will also be allowed to help yourself first to whatever is nearest  you, before passing it to another; for passing things around in camp is  risky, and should be avoided as much as possible for that reason.    Eat with your hats on, as it is more comfortable, and the wind is not so  apt to blow your stray hairs into the next man's dish.    If you have no fork, do not mind eating with your knife and fingers.  But, however much liberty you take, do not be rude, coarse, or uncivil:  these bad habits grow rapidly in camp if you encourage them, and are  broken off with difficulty on return.    If there is no separate knife for the butter, cheese, and meat, nor  spoon for the gravy and soup, you can use your own by first wiping the  knife or spoon upon a piece of bread.    Be social and agreeable to all fellow-travellers you meet. It is a  received rule now, I believe, that you are under no obligations to  consider travelling-acquaintances as permanent: so you are in duty bound  to be friendly to all thrown in your way. However, it is not fair to  thrust your company upon others, nor compel a courtesy from any one. Try  to remember too, that it is nothing wonderful to camp out or walk; and  do not expect any one to think it is. We frequently meet parties of  young folks walking through the mountains, who do great things with  their tongues, but not much with their feet. If you will refrain from  bragging, you can speak of your short marches without exciting contempt.    Avoid as much as possible asking another member of the party to do your  work, or to wait upon you: it is surprising how easily you can make  yourself disliked by asking a few trifling favors of one who is tired  and hungry.      MOSQUITOES, BLACK FLIES, AND MIDGE.    These pests will annoy you exceedingly almost everywhere in the summer.  In the daytime motion and perspiration keep them off to some extent. At  night, or when lying down, you can do no better than to cover yourself  so that they cannot reach your body, and have a mosquito-bar of some  sort over your head. The simplest thing is a square yard of  mosquito-netting thrown over the head, and tucked in well. You will need  to have your hat first thrown over the head, and your shirt-collar  turned up, to prevent the mosquitoes reaching through the mesh to your  face and neck.    A better way than this is to make a box-shaped mosquito-bar, large  enough to stretch across the head of the bed, and cover the heads and  shoulders of all that sleep in the tent. It should be six or eight feet  long, twenty to twenty-six inches wide, and one yard or more high. It  will be more durable, but not quite so well ventilated, if the top is  made of light cloth instead of netting. The seams should be bound with  stout tape, and the sides and ends \"gathered\" considerably in sewing  them to the top. Even then the side that falls over the shoulders of the  sleepers may not be loose enough to fill the hollows between them; the  netting will then have to be tucked under the blanket, or have something  thrown over its lower edge.    Sew loops or strings on the four upper corners, and corresponding loops  or strings on the tent, so that you can tie up the bar.    Bobbinet lace is better than the common netting for all of these  purposes. It comes in pieces twelve to fourteen yards long, and two  yards wide. You cannot often find it for sale; but the large shops in  the principal cities that do a great business by correspondence can send  it to you.    Oil of cedar and oil of pennyroyal are recommended as serviceable in  driving off mosquitoes, and there are patented compounds whose labels  pretend great things: you will try them only once, I think.    Ammoniated opodeldoc rubbed upon the bites will in a great measure stop  the itching, and hasten the cure.    They say that a little gunpowder flashed in the tent will drive out  flies and mosquitoes. I saw a man try it once, but noticed that he  himself went out in a great hurry, while the flies, if they went at all,  were back again before he was.    A better thing, really the best, is a smudge made by building a small  fire to the windward of your tent, and nearly smothering it with chips,  moss, bark, or rotten wood. If you make the smudge in an old pan or pot,  you can move it about as often as the wind changes.      HOW TO SKIN FISH.    When you camp by the seaside, you will catch cunners and other fish that  need skinning. Let no one persuade you to slash the back fins out with a  single stroke, as you would whittle a stick; but take a sharp knife, cut  on both sides of the fin, and then pull out the whole of it from head to  tail, and thus save the trouble that a hundred little bones will make if  left in. After cutting the skin on the under side from head to tail, and  taking out the entrails and small fins, start the skin where the head  joins the body, and pull it off one side at a time. Some men stick an  awl through a cunner's head, or catch it fast in a stout iron hook, to  hold it while skinning.    Cunners and lobsters are sometimes caught off bold rocks in a net. You  can make one easily out of a hogshead-hoop, and twine stretched across  so as to make a three-inch mesh.[25] Tie a lot of bait securely in the  middle, sink it for a few minutes, and draw up rapidly. The rush of  water through the net prevents the fish from escaping.      EXPENSES.    The expenses of camping or walking vary greatly, of course, according to  the route, manner of going, and other things. The principal items are  railroad-tickets, horse and wagon hire, trucking, land-rent (if you camp  where rent is charged), and the cost of the outfit. You ought to be able  to reckon very nearly what you will have to pay on account of these  before you spend a cent. After this will come the calculation whether to  travel at all by rail, supposing you wish to go a hundred miles to reach  the seaside where you propose to camp, or the mountains you want to  climb. If you have a horse and wagon, or are going horseback, it will  doubtless be cheaper to march than to ride and pay freight. If time is  plenty and money is scarce, you may perhaps be able to walk the  distance cheaper than to go by rail; but, if you lodge at hotels, you  will find it considerably more expensive. The question then is apt to  turn on whether the hundred miles is worth seeing, and whether it is so  thickly settled as to prevent your camping.    To walk a hundred miles, carrying your kit all the way, will take from  one to two weeks, according to your age, strength, and the weather. We  have already stated that there is little _pleasure_ in walking more than  sixty miles a week. But if you wish to go as fast as you can, and have  taken pains to practise walking before starting, and can buy your food  in small quantities daily, and can otherwise reduce your baggage, you  can make the hundred miles in a week without difficulty, and more if it  is necessary, unless there is much bad weather.    The expense for food will also vary according to one's will; but it need  not be heavy if you can content yourself with simple fare. You can  hardly live at a cheaper rate than the following:--      ONE WEEK'S SUPPLY FOR TWO MEN.    Ten pounds of pilot-bread; eight pounds of salt pork; one pound of  coffee (roasted and ground); one to two pounds of sugar (granulated);  thirty pounds of potatoes (half a bushel).[26] A little beef and butter,  and a few ginger-snaps, will be good investments.    Supposing you and I were to start from home in the morning after  breakfast; when noon comes, we eat the lunch we have taken with us, and  press on. As the end of the day's march approaches, we look out to buy  two quarts of potatoes at a farmhouse or store; and we boil or fry, or  boil and mash in milk, enough of these for our supper. The breakfast  next morning is much the same. We cook potatoes in every way we know,  and eat the whole of our stock remaining, thus saving so much weight to  carry. We also soak some pilot-bread, and fry that for a dessert, eating  a little sugar on it if we can spare it. When dinner-time approaches, we  keep a lookout for a chance to buy ten or twelve cents' worth of bread  or biscuits. These are more palatable than the pilot-bread or crackers  in our haversack. If we have a potato left from breakfast, we cook and  eat it now. We cut off a slice of the corned beef, and take a nibble at  the ginger-snaps. If we think we can afford three or four cents more, we  buy a pint of milk, and make a little dip-toast. And so we go;  sometimes we catch a fish, or pass an orchard whose owner gives us all  the windfalls we want. We pick berries too; and keep a sharp lookout  that we supply ourselves in season when our pilot-bread, sugar, pork,  and butter run low. Some days we overtake farmers driving ox-carts or  wagons; we throw our kits aboard, and walk slowly along, willing to lose  a little time to save our aching shoulders. And in due time, if no  accident befalls, nor rainy weather detains us, we arrive at our  seashore or mountain.    You may like to know that this is almost an exact history, at least as  far as eating is concerned, of a twelve days' tramp I once went on in  company with two other boys. There was about five dollars in the party,  and nearly two dollars of this was spent in paying toll on a boat that  we took through a canal a part of the way. We carried coffee, sugar,  pork, and beef from home, and ate potatoes three times a day. We had a  delightful time, and came home fattened up somewhat; but I will admit  that I did not call for potatoes when I got back to my father's table,  for some days. "]]]
