These festivals gave occasion for  theatrical performances[3] and religious songs in which the legends of  Hindu mythology were skilfully exploited to stir up hatred of the  \"foreigner\"--and _mlenccha_, the term employed for \"foreigner,\" applied  equally to Europeans and to Mahomedans--as well as for tumultuous  processions only too well calculated to provoke affrays with the  Mahomedans and with the police, which in turn led to judicial  proceedings that served as a fresh excuse for noisy protests and  inflammatory pleadings. With the Ganpati celebrations the area of  Tilak's propaganda was widely increased.    But the movement had yet to be given a form which should directly appeal  to the fighting instincts of the Mahrattas and stimulate active  disaffection by reviving memories of olden times when under Shivaji's  leadership they had rolled back the tide of Musulman conquest and  created a Mahratta Empire of their own. The legends of Shivaji's prowess  still lingered in Maharashtra, where the battlemented strongholds which  he built crown many a precipitous crag of the Deccan highlands. In a  valley below Pratabghar the spot is still shown where Shivaji induced  the Mahomedan general, Afzul Khan, to meet him in peaceful conference  half-way between the contending armies, and, as he bent down to greet  his guest, plunged into his bowels the famous \"tiger's claw,\" a hooked  gauntlet of steel, while the Mahratta forces sprang out of ambush and  cut the Mahomedan army to pieces. But if Shivaji's memory still lived,  it belonged to a past which was practically dead and gone. Only a few  years, before an Englishman who had visited Shivaji's tomb had written  to a local newspaper calling attention to the ruinous condition into  which the people of Maharashtra had allowed the last resting-place of  their national hero to fall. Some say it was this letter which first  inspired Tilak with the idea of reviving Shivaji's memory and converting  it into a living force. Originally it was upon the great days of the  Poona Peshwas that Tilak had laid the chief stress, and he may possibly  have discovered that theirs were not after all names to conjure with  amongst non-Brahman Mahrattas, who had suffered heavily enough at their  hands. At any rate, Tilak brought Shivaji to the forefront and set in  motion a great \"national\" propaganda which culminated in 1895 in the  celebration at all the chief centres of Brahman activity in the Deccan  of Shivaji's reputed birthday, the principal commemoration being held  under Tilak's own presidency at Raighar, where the Mahratta chieftain  had himself been crowned. What was the purpose and significance of this  movement may be gathered from a _Shlok_ or sacred poem improvised on  this occasion by one of Tilak's disciples who to acquire sinister  notoriety.       Let us be prompt like Shivaji to engage in desperate enterprises.     Take up your swords and shields and we shall cut     off countless heads of enemies. Listen! Though we shall     have to risk our lives in a national war, we shall assuredly     shed the life-blood of our enemies.    It was on the occasion of the Shivaji \"coronation festivities\" that the  right--nay, the duty--to commit murder for political purposes was first  publicly expounded. With Tilak in the chair, a Brahman professor got up  to vindicate Shivaji's bloody deed:--       Who dares to call that man a murderer who, when only     nine years old, had received Divine inspiration not to bow     down before a Mahomedan Emperor? Who dares to condemn     Shivaji for disregarding a minor duty in the performance     of a major one? Had Shivaji committed five or fifty     crimes more terrible, I would have been equally ready to     prostrate myself not once but one hundred times before the     image of our lord Shivaji ... Every Hindu, every     Mahratta must rejoice at this spectacle, for we too are all     striving to regain our lost independence, and it is only by     combination that we can throw off the yoke.    Tilak himself was even more outspoken:--       It is needless to make further researches as to the killing     of Afzul Khan. Let us even assume that Shivaji deliberately     planned and executed the murder. Was the act good or     evil? This question cannot be answered from the standpoint     of the Penal Code or of the laws of Manu or according     to the principles of morality laid down in the systems of the     West or of the East. The laws which bind society are for     common folk like you and me. No one seeks to trace the     genealogy of a Rishi or to fasten guilt upon a Maharaj. Great     men are above the common principles of morality. Such     principles do not reach to the pedestal of a great man. Did     Shivaji commit a sin in killing Afzul Khan? The answer to     this question can be found in the Mahabharata itself. The     Divine Krishna teaching in the Gita tells us we may kill     even our teachers and our kinsmen, and no blame attaches     if we are not actuated by selfish desires. Shivaji did nothing     from a desire to fill his own belly. It was in a praiseworthy     object that he murdered Afzul Khan for the good of others.     If thieves enter our house and we have not strength to drive     them out, should we not without hesitation shut them in,     and burn them alive? God has conferred on the _mlencchas_     (foreigners) no grant of Hindustan inscribed on imperishable     brass. Shivaji strove to drive them forth out of the land of     his birth, but he was guiltless of the sin of covetousness.     Do not circumscribe your vision like frogs in a well. Rise     above the Penal Code into the rarefied atmosphere of the     sacred Bhaghavad Gita and consider the action of great men.    In the reflected blaze of this apotheosis of Shivaji, Tilak stood forth  as the appointed leader of the \"nation.\" He was the triumphant champion  of Hindu orthodoxy, the high-priest of Ganesh, the inspired prophet of a  new \"nationalism,\" which in the name of Shivaji would cast out the hated  _mlencchas_ and restore the glories of Mahratta history. The Government  feared him, for people could put no other construction on the official  confirmation of his election when he was returned in 1895 as a member of  the Bombay Legislative Council--above all, when inside the Council-room  he continued with the same audacity and the same impunity his campaign  of calumny and insult. His activity was unceasing. He disdained none of  the arts which make for popularity. His house was always open to those  who sought in the right spirit for assistance or advice. He had absolute  control of the Sabha and ruled the municipality of Poona. In private and  in public, through his speeches and through his newspapers, he worked  upon the prejudices and passions of both the educated and the  uneducated, and especially upon the crude enthusiasm of the young.  Towards the end of 1896 the Deccan was threatened with famine. Hungry  stomachs are prompt to violence, and Tilak started a \"no-rent\" campaign.  Like all Tilak's schemes in those days it was carefully designed to  conceal as far as possible any direct incitement to the withholding of  land revenue. His missionaries went round with a story that Government  had issued orders not to collect taxes where the crops had fallen below  a certain yield. The _rayats_ believed them, and when the tax-gatherer  arrived they refused payment. Trouble then arose. Outrages such as the  mutilation of the Queen's statue at Bombay, the attempt to fire the  Church Mission Hall, the assaults upon \"moderate\" Hindus who refused to  toe the line, became ominously frequent. Worse was to follow when the  plague appeared. The measures at first adopted by Government to check  the spread of this new visitation doubtless offended in many ways  against the customs and prejudices of the people, especially the  searching and disinfection of houses, and the forcible removal of  plague-patients even when they happened to be Brahmans. What Tilak could  do by secret agitation and by a rabid campaign in the Press to raise  popular resentment to a white heat he did. The _Kesari_ published  incitements to violence which were put into the mouth of Shivaji  himself[4]. The inevitable consequences ensued. On June 27, 1897, on  their way back from an official reception in celebration of Queen  Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, Mr. Rand, an Indian civilian, who was  President of the Poona Plague Committee, and Lieutenant Ayerst, of the  Commissariat Department, were shot down by Damodhar Chapekur, a young  Chitpavan Brahman, on the Ganeshkind road. No direct connexion has been  established between that crime and Tilak. But, like the murderer of Mr.  Jackson at Nasik last winter, the murderer of Rand and Ayerst--the same  young Brahman who had recited the _Shlok_, which I have quoted above, at  the great Shivaji celebration--declared that it was the doctrines  expounded in Tilak's newspapers that had driven him to the deed. The  murderer who had merely given effect to the teachings of Tilak was  sentenced to death, but Tilak himself, who was prosecuted for a  seditious article published a few days before the murder, received only  a short term of imprisonment, and was released before the completion of  his term under certain pledges of good behaviour which he broke as soon  as it suited him to break them.    Thus ended the first campaign of Indian unrest, which, in its details,  has served as an incitement and a model to all those who have conducted  subsequent operations in the same field.    The Poona murders sent a thrill of horror throughout India and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#12)"],[1,"resources which we have to-day.    Let us have the courage to admit, however, that these resources are only  partly utilized as they can or should be. To draw from a great  instrument all its possibilities, to begin with, one must understand it  thoroughly, and that understanding cannot be gained over night. The  organ, as we have seen, is a collection of an indefinite number of  instruments. It places before the organist extraordinary means of  expressing himself. No two of these instruments are precisely alike. The  organ is only a theme with innumerable variations, determined by the  place in which it is to be installed, by the amount of money at the  builder's disposal, by his inventiveness, and, often, by his personal  whims. As a result time is required for the organist to learn his  instrument thoroughly. After this he is as free as the fish in the sea,  and his only preoccupation is the music. Then, to play freely with the  colors on his vast palette, there is but one way--he must plunge boldly  into improvisation.    Now improvisation is the particular glory of the French school, but it  has been injured seriously of late by the influence of the German  school. Under the pretext that an improvisation is not so good as one of  Sebastian Bach's or Mendelssohn's masterpieces, young organists have  stopped improvising.    That point of view is harmful because it is absolutely false; it is  simply the negation of eloquence. Consider what the legislative hall,  the lecture room and the court would be like if nothing but set pieces  were delivered. We are familiar with the fact that many an orator and  lawyer, who is brilliant when he talks, becomes dry as dust when he  tries to write. The same thing happens in music. Lefebure-Wely was a  wonderful improviser (I can say this emphatically, for I heard him) but  he left only a few unimportant compositions for the organ. I might also  name some of my contemporaries who express themselves completely only  through their improvisations. The organ is thought-provoking. As one  touches the organ, the imagination is awakened, and the unforeseen rises  from the depths of the unconscious. It is a world of its own, ever new,  which will never be seen again, and which comes out of the darkness, as  an enchanted island comes from the sea.    Instead of this fairyland, we too often see only some of Sebastian  Bach's or Mendelssohn's pieces repeated continuously. The pieces  themselves are very fine, but they belong to concerts and are entirely  out of place in church services. Furthermore, they were written for old  instruments and they apply either not at all, or badly, to the modern  organ. Yet there are those who think this belief spells progress.    I am fully aware of what may be said against improvisation. There are  players who improvise badly and their playing is uninteresting. But many  preachers speak badly. That, however, has nothing to do with the real  issue. A mediocre improvisation is always endurable, if the organist has  grasped the idea that church music should harmonize with the service and  aid meditation and prayer. If the organ music is played in this spirit  and results in harmonious sounds rather than in precise music which is  not worth writing out, it still is comparable with the old glass  windows in which the individual figures can hardly be distinguished but  which are, nevertheless, more charming than the finest modern windows.  Such an improvisation may be better than a fugue by a great master, on  the principle that nothing in art is good unless it is in its proper  place.    [Illustration: The Madeleine where M. Saint-Saens played the organ for  twenty years]    During the twenty years I played the organ at the Madeleine, I  improvised constantly, giving my fancy the widest range. That was one of  the joys of life.    But there was a tradition that I was a severe, austere musician. The  public was led to believe that I played nothing but fugues. So current  was this belief that a young woman about to be married begged me to play  no fugues at her wedding!    Another young woman asked me to play funeral marches. She wanted to cry  at her wedding, and as she had no natural inclination to do so, she  counted on the organ to bring tears to her eyes.    But this case was unique. Ordinarily, they were afraid of my  severity--although this severity was tempered.    One day one of the parish vicars undertook to instruct me on this point.  He told me that the Madeleine audiences were composed in the main of  wealthy people who attended the Opera-Comique frequently, and formed  musical tastes which ought to be respected.    \"Monsieur l'abbe,\" I replied, \"when I hear from the pulpit the language  of opera-comique, I will play music appropriate to it, and not before!\"          CHAPTER XI    JOSEPH HAYDN AND THE \"SEVEN WORDS\"      Joseph Haydn, that great musician, the father of the symphony and of all  modern music, has been neglected. We are too prone to forget that  concerts are, in a sense, museums in which the older schools of music  should be represented. Music is something besides a source of sensuous  pleasure and keen emotion, and this resource, precious as it is, is only  a chance corner in the wide realm of musical art. He who does not get  absolute pleasure from a simple series of well-constructed chords,  beautiful only in their arrangement, is not really fond of music. The  same is true of the one who does not prefer the first prelude of the  _Wohltemperirte Klavier_, played without gradations, just as the author  wrote it for the harpsichord, to the same prelude embellished with an  impassioned melody; or who does not prefer a popular melody of character  or a Gregorian chant without any accompaniment to a series of dissonant  and pretentious chords.    The directors of great concerts should love music themselves and should  lead the public to appreciate it. They should not allow the masters to  be forgotten, for their only fault was that they were not born in our  times and they never dreamed of attempting to satisfy the tastes of an  unborn generation. Above all, the directors should grant recognition to  masters like Joseph Haydn who were in advance of their own times and who  seem now and then to belong to our own.    The only examples of Joseph Haydn's immense work that the present  generation knows are two or three symphonies, rarely and perfunctorily  performed. This is the same as saying that we do not know him at all. No  musician was ever more prolific or showed a greater wealth of  imagination. When we examine this mine of jewels, we are astonished to  find at every step a gem which we would have attributed to the invention  of some modern or other. We are dazzled by their rays, and where we  expect black-and-whites we find pastels grown dim with time.    Of Haydn's one hundred and eighteen symphonies, many are simple trifles  written from day to day for Prince Esterhazy's little chapel, when the  master was musical director there. But after Haydn was called to London  by Salomon, a director of concerts, where he had a large orchestra at  his disposal, his genius took magnificent flights. Then he wrote great  symphonies and in them the clarinets for the first time unfolded the  resources from which the modern orchestra has profited so abundantly.  Originally the clarinet played a humble role, as the name indicates.  _Clarinetto_ is the diminutive of _clarino_, and the instrument was  invented to replace the shrill tones that the trumpet lost as it gained  in depth of tone.    Old editions of Haydn's symphonies show a picturesque arrangement, in  that the disposition of the orchestra is shown on the printed page.  Above, is a group made up of drums and the brass. In the center is a  second group--the flutes, oboes and bassoons, while the stringed  instruments are at the bottom of the page. When clarinets are used, they  are a part of the first group. This pretty arrangement has,  unfortunately, not been followed in the modern editions of these  symphonies. In the works written in London the clarinet has utterly  forgotten its origins. It has left the somewhat plebeian world of the  brasses and has gained admittance to the more refined society of the  woods. Haydn, in his first attempts, took advantage of the beautiful  heavy tones, \"_chalumeau_,\" and the flexibility and marvellous range of  a beautiful instrument.    During his stay in London Haydn sketched an _Orfeo_ which he never  completed, as the theatre which ordered it failed before it was  finished. Only fragments of the work remain, and, fortunately enough,  these have been engraved in an orchestra score. These fragments are  uneven in value. The dialogue, or recitative, which should bind them  together was lost and so we are unable to judge them fairly. Among the  fragments is a brilliant aria on Eurydice which is rather ridiculous,  while another on Eurydice dying is charming. We also find music for  mysterious _English horns_; it is written as for clarinets in B flat and  reaches heights which are impossible for the instrument we now know as  the English horn. There is also a beautiful bass part. This has been  provided with Latin words and is sung in churches. This aria was  assigned to a Creon who does not appear in the other fragments. One  scene shows Eurydice running up and down the banks pursued by demons.  Another depicts the death of Orpheus, killed by the Bacchantes. This  score is a curiosity and nothing more, and a reading causes no regret  that the work was not completed.    Like Gluck, Joseph Haydn had the rare advantage of developing  constantly. He did not reach the height of his genius until an age when  the finest faculties are, ordinarily, in a decline. He astounded the  musical world with his _Creation_, in which he displayed a fertility of  imagination and a magnificence of orchestral richness that the oratorio  had never known before."]]]
