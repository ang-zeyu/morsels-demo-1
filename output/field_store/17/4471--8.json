I have described one of the poorest of the \"fellah\" villages, but the  traveller is often more luxuriously housed. Many of the native  landowners occupy roomy and well-appointed dwellings, often surrounded  by pretty and well-stocked gardens, where one may rest beneath the  vines and fig-trees, and enjoy the pomegranates, apricots, and other  fruits which it supplies. These houses are generally clean and  comfortably furnished after the Turkish manner. The host,  prosperous-looking and well clothed, meets his guest at the doorstep  or assists him to dismount, when, with many compliments and  expressions of delight at his visit, he is conducted to the  guest-chamber. Coffee and sweet meats are then presented, a foretaste  of the generous meal to follow, for in the homes of the well-to-do a  feast is usually provided for an honoured guest.    The food is served on the low \"sahniyeh,\" or tray, which forms the  table, on which several flat loaves surrounded by little dishes of  salad and other condiments, mark the places of the diners; but before  eating, each person present ceremoniously washes his hands and mouth,  a servant bringing in the copper \"tisht wa abrik,\" or jug and  basin, kept for that purpose.    The meal always begins with soup, which, greasy to begin with, is  rendered more so by the addition of a bowl of melted butter. This is  eaten with a spoon, the only utensil provided, each person dipping  into the bowl, which is placed in the centre of the table. The rest of  the meal, which consists of fish, pigeons, and various kinds of stews  and salads, is eaten with the hands, the diners often presenting each  other with choice morsels from their portion; a baked turkey stuffed  with nuts, or on important occasions a whole sheep, forms the  principal dish, which is cleverly divided by the host or principal  guest without the aid of knife or fork. Water in porous jars, often  flavoured with rose-leaves or verbena, is presented by servants as the  meal proceeds. The final dish always consists of boiled rice and milk  sweetened with honey, a delicious dish, which is eaten with the same  spoon by which the soup was partaken of.    Such fare as I have described is only for the wealthy. In general the  \"fellahin\" live on rice and wheaten bread, sugar-cane, and  vegetables, with the occasional addition of a little meat, or such  fish as may be caught in the canals. Their beverage is water, coffee  being a luxury only occasionally indulged in, and their use of tobacco  is infrequent.    Theirs is a simple life whose daily round of labour is only broken by  the occasional marriage feast, or village fair, or, in the more  populous centres, by the periodic \"Muled,\" or religious festival.    In Cairo and other large cities, these \"Muleds\" are very elaborate,  and often last for days together. Then business is suspended, and, as  at our Christmas-time, everyone gives himself up to enjoyment and the  effort to make others happy. Gay booths are erected in the open  spaces, in which is singing and the performance of strange Eastern  dances. Mummers and conjurers perform in the streets, and  merry-go-rounds and swing-boats amuse the youngsters, whose pleasure  is further enhanced by the many stalls and barrows displaying toy  balloons, dolls, and sweetmeats.    All wear their gayest clothing, and at night illuminations delight the  hearts of these simple people.    The principal feasts are the \"Muled-en-Nebbi,\" or birth of  Mohammed, and \"El Hussanen,\" in memory of the martyred grandson of the  Prophet, and although they are Mohammedans the \"Eed-el-Imam,\" or birth  of Christ, takes a high place among their religious celebrations.    But they have their fasts also, and Ramadan, which lasts for four  weeks, is far more strictly observed than Lent among ourselves, for  throughout that period, from sunrise to sunset, the Moslem abstains  from food or drink, except in the case of the aged or infirm, or of  anyone engaged upon work so arduous as to render food necessary, for  the Mohammedan does not allow his religion to interfere with his other  duties in life.    On the last day of Ramadan occurs a pretty observance similar to that  of All Souls' day in France; then everyone visits the tombs of their  relatives, laying garlands upon the graves and often passing the  night in the cemeteries in little booths made for the purpose.    You will have noticed how large a place _religion_ takes in the life  of the people, and in their idle hours no subject of conversation is  more common. To the average Mohammedan his religion is a very real  matter in which he fervently believes, and Allah is to him a very  personal God, whom he may at all times approach in praise or prayer in  the certain belief of His fatherly care. Nothing impresses a traveller  more than this tremendous belief of the Mohammedans in their Deity and  their religion; and though many people, probably from lack of  knowledge, hold the view that the Moslem faith is a debased one, it is  in reality a fine religion, teaching many wise and beautiful  doctrines, and ennobling the lives of all who live up to the best that  is in it.    Unfortunately the teaching of Mohammedanism is so largely fatalistic  that it tends to deprive the individual of personal initiative. \"The  Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the  Lord,\" is a general attitude of mind, and this, combined with their  long centuries of servitude, has had so much effect upon the national  character of the Egyptian that they almost entirely lack those  qualities of alertness, confidence, and sense of personal  responsibility without which no race can become great or even, indeed,  be self-respecting.    The higher education now general in Egypt has already had its effect  upon the present generation, among which a feeling of ambition and  independence is growing, while the Egyptian army has shown what  wonders may be wrought, even with the poorest material, by sustained  and honest effort in the right direction; and if the just and  sympathetic guidance which it has enjoyed for now a quarter of a  century is not too soon withdrawn, Egypt may once again become a  nation.    As it is, to-day the great mass of the people remain much as they have  been for ages; a simple, kindly people, ignorant and often fanatical,  but broadly good-humoured and keenly alive to a joke; fond of their  children, and showing great consideration for age, they have many  traits which endear them to those who have lived among them, while  their faults are largely on the surface, and due in some measure to  the centuries of ignorance and slavery which has been their lot.    The greatest blot upon the Egyptian character is the position accorded  to their women, who, as in all Mohammedan countries, are considered to  be soulless. From infancy employed in the most menial occupations,  they are not even permitted to enter the mosques at prayer-time, and  until recently the scanty education which the boys enjoyed was denied  to their sisters. It is no wonder, therefore, that these often  beautiful girls grow up much like graceful animals, ignorant of the  higher duties of life, and exercising none of that refining and  ennobling influence which have made the Western races what they are.          CHAPTER X    THE DESERT      When so much of geographical Egypt consists of desert, it would be  interesting if I were to tell you something about it before closing  this little book. Probably the first question my readers would ask  would be, \"What use is it?\" Why does Nature create such vast wastes of  land and rock which can be of little or no use to anybody?    We cannot always follow the intentions of Nature, or see what may  ultimately result, but so far as the desert is concerned we know of at  least _one_ useful purpose it serves, and that is the making of  _climate_.    Edinburgh and Moscow are in precisely the same latitudes, yet the one  is equable in temperature while the other endures the rigours of an  arctic winter. The South of Iceland also suffers less from cold than  do the great central plains of Europe. And why? Simply because their  different climates are the result of special conditions or influences  of Nature, and what the Gulf Stream does for the British Isles the  deserts of Africa effect not only for Egypt, but for the whole of  Southern Europe, whose genial climate is mainly caused by the warm air  generated on these sun-baked barren lands.    Now let us see what the desert is like in appearance. It is a very  common impression that the desert is simply a flat expanse of sand,  colourless and unbroken; in reality it is quite different, being full  of variations, which give it much the same diversity of interest as  the ocean.    The colour of the sand varies infinitely, according to its situation.  Thus the desert which surrounds Assuan, which is composed of decimated  granite and Nile silt, is generally grey; in Nubia the sand is formed  of powdered sandstone of a curiously golden tint, while the desert of  Suez, which abuts on Cairo and the Delta provinces, is generally white  in tone, due to the admixture of limestone dust of which it is largely  composed. The great Sahara also is no monotonous stretch of sand, but  is to a great extent covered by wild herbs of many kinds, which often  entirely screen the sand from view, and give it the appearance of a  prairie.    Nor is the desert always flat, for its huge undulations suggest ocean  billows petrified into stillness, while rocky hills and  earthquake-riven valleys give it a fantastic variety which is wildly  picturesque.    Though generally barren, the desert supports growths of many kinds;  wild hyssop, thorns, the succulent ice-plant, and a great variety of  other shrubs. Flowers also abound, and though they are usually small,  I have counted as many as twenty varieties in an area of as many feet,  and in some of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#12)"],[1,"the pleasure of pursuing the rich.  Many times he had turned back to the little mud house, almost  broken-hearted at seeing his playmates running, full of glee, after the  great men's chairs.    On the day when this story opens, just as the last horseman had passed  out of sight among the cedars, Bamboo chanced to look up toward one of  the smaller temple buildings of which his father was the keeper. It was  the house through which the visitors had just been shown. Could his eyes  be deceiving him? No, the great iron doors had been forgotten in the  hurry of the moment, and there they stood wide open, as if inviting him  to enter.    In great excitement he scurried toward the temple. How often he had  pressed his head against the bars and looked into the dark room, wishing  and hoping that some day he might go in. And yet, not once had he been  granted this favour. Almost every day since babyhood he had gazed at the  high stone shaft, or tablet, covered with Chinese writing, that stood  in the centre of the lofty room, reaching almost to the roof. But  with still greater surprise his eyes had feasted on the giant turtle  underneath, on whose back the column rested. There are many such tablets  to be seen in China, many such turtles patiently bearing their loads of  stone, but this was the only sight of the kind that Bamboo had seen. He  had never been outside the Hsi Ling forest, and, of course, knew very  little of the great world beyond.    It is no wonder then that the turtle and the tablet had always  astonished him. He had asked his father to explain the mystery. \"Why  do they have a turtle? Why not a lion or an elephant?\" For he had seen  stone figures of these animals in the park and had thought them much  better able than his friend, the turtle, to carry loads on their backs.  \"Why it's just the custom,\" his father had replied--the answer always  given when Bamboo asked a question, \"just the custom.\" The boy had tried  to imagine it all for himself, but had never been quite sure that he  was right, and now, joy of all joys, he was about to enter the very  turtle-room itself. Surely, once inside, he could find some answer  to this puzzle of his childhood.    Breathless, he dashed through the doorway, fearing every minute that  some one would notice the open gates and close them before he could  enter. Just in front of the giant turtle he fell in a little heap on the  floor, which was covered inch-deep with dust. His face was streaked, his  clothes were a sight to behold; but Bamboo cared nothing for such  trifles. He lay there for a few moments, not daring to move. Then,  hearing a noise outside, he crawled under the ugly stone beast and  crouched in his narrow hiding-place, as still as a mouse.    \"There, there!\" said a deep voice. \"See what you are doing, stirring up  such a dust! Why, you will strangle me if you are not careful.\"    It was the turtle speaking, and yet Bamboo's father had often told him  that it was not alive. The boy lay trembling for a minute, too much  frightened to get up and run.    \"No use in shaking so, my lad,\" the voice continued, a little more  kindly. \"I suppose all boys are alike--good for nothing but kicking up  a dust.\" He finished this sentence with a hoarse chuckle, and the boy,  seeing that he was laughing, looked up with wonder at the strange  creature.    \"I meant no harm in coming,\" said the child finally. \"I only wanted to  look at you more closely.\"    \"Oh, that was it, hey? Well, that is strange. All the others come and  stare at the tablet on my back. Sometimes they read aloud the nonsense  written there about dead emperors and their titles, but they never so  much as look at me, at _me_ whose father was one of the great four who  made the world.\"    Bamboo's eyes shone with wonder. \"What! _your_ father helped make the  world?\" he gasped.    \"Well, not my father exactly, but one of my grandfathers, and it amounts  to the same thing, doesn't it. But, hark! I hear a voice. The keeper is  coming back. Run up and close those doors, so he won't notice that they  have not been locked. Then you may hide in the corner there until he has  passed. I have something more to tell you.\"    Bamboo did as he was told. It took all his strength to swing the heavy  doors into place. He felt very important to think that he was doing  something for the grandson of a maker of the world, and it would have  broken his heart if this visit had been ended just as it was beginning.    Sure enough, his father and the other keepers passed on, never dreaming  that the heavy locks were not fastened as usual. They were talking about  the great men who had just gone. They seemed very happy and were  jingling some coins in their hands.    \"Now, my boy,\" said the stone turtle when the sound of voices had died  away and Bamboo had come out from his corner, \"maybe you think I'm proud  of my job. Here I've been holding up this chunk for a hundred years, I  who am fond of travel. During all this time night and day, I have been  trying to think of some way to give up my position. Perhaps it's  honourable, but, you may well imagine, it's not very pleasant.\"    \"I should think you would have the backache,\" ventured Bamboo timidly.    \"Backache! well, I think so; back, neck, legs, eyes, everything I have  is aching, aching for freedom. But, you see, even if I had kicked up  my heels and overthrown this monument, I had no way of getting through  those iron bars,\" and he nodded toward the gate.    \"Yes, I understand,\" agreed Bamboo, beginning to feel sorry for his old  friend.    \"But, now that you are here, I have a plan, and a good one it is, too, I  think. The watchmen have forgotten to lock the gate. What is to prevent  my getting my freedom this very night? You open the gate, I walk out,  and no one the wiser.\"    \"But my father will lose his head if they find that he has failed to do  his duty and you have escaped.\"    \"Oh, no; not at all. You can slip his keys to-night, lock the gates  after I am gone, and no one will know just what has happened. Why it  will make this building famous. It won't hurt your father, but will do  him good. So many travellers will be anxious to see the spot from which  I vanished. I am too heavy for a thief to carry off, and they will be  sure that it is another miracle of the gods. Oh, I shall have a good  time out in the big world.\"    Just here Bamboo began to cry.    \"Now what is the silly boy blubbering about?\" sneered the turtle. \"Is he  nothing but a cry-baby?\"    \"No, but I don't want you to go.\"    \"Don't want me to go, eh? Just like all the others. You're a fine  fellow! What reason have you for wanting to see me weighed down here all  the rest of my life with a mountain on my back? Why, I thought you were  sorry for me, and it turns out that you are as mean as anybody else.\"    \"It is so lonely here, and I have no playmates. You are the only friend  I have.\"    The tortoise laughed loudly. \"Ho, ho! so it's because I make you a  good playmate, eh? Now, if that's your reason, that's another story  altogether. What do you say to going with me then? I, too, need a  friend, and if you help me to escape, why, you are the very friend  for me.\"    \"But how shall you get the tablet off your back?\" questioned Bamboo  doubtfully. \"It's very heavy.\"    \"That's easy, just walk out of the door. The tablet is too tall to go  through. It will slide off and sit on the floor instead of on my shell.\"    Bamboo, wild with delight at the thought of going on a journey with the  turtle, promised to obey the other's commands. After supper, when all  were asleep in the little house of the keeper, he slipped from his bed,  took down the heavy key from its peg, and ran pell-mell to the temple.    \"Well, you didn't forget me, did you?\" asked the turtle when Bamboo  swung the iron gates open.    \"Oh, no, I would not break a promise. Are you ready?\"    \"Yes, quite ready.\" So saying, the turtle took a step. The tablet swayed  backward and forward, but did not fall. On walked the turtle until  finally he stuck his ugly head through the doorway. \"Oh, how good it  looks outside,\" he said. \"How pleasant the fresh air feels! Is that the  moon rising over yonder? It's the first time I've seen it for an age.  My word! just look at the trees! How they have grown since they set that  tombstone on my back! There's a regular forest outside now.\"    Bamboo was delighted when he saw the turtle's glee at escaping. \"Be  careful,\" he cried, \"not to let the tablet fall hard enough to break  it.\"    Even as he spoke, the awkward beast waddled through the door. The upper  end of the monument struck against the wall, toppled off, and fell with  a great crash to the floor. Bamboo shivered with fear. Would his father  come and find out what had happened?    \"Don't be afraid, my boy. No one will come at this hour of the night to  spy on us.\"    Bamboo quickly locked the gates, ran back to the house, and hung the  key on its peg. He took a long look at his sleeping parents, and then  returned to his friend. After all, he would not be gone long and his  father would surely forgive him.    Soon the comrades were walking down the broad road, very slowly, for the  tortoise is not swift of foot and Bamboo's legs were none too long.    \"Where are you going?\" said the boy at last, after he had begun to feel  more at home with the turtle.    \"Going? Where should you think I would want to go after my century in  prison? Why, back to the first home of my father, back to the very spot  where the great god, P'anku, and his three helpers hewed out the world.\"    \"And is it far?\" faltered the boy, beginning to feel just the least bit  tired.    \"At this rate, yes, but, bless my life, you didn't think we could travel  all the way at this snail's pace, I hope. Jump on my back, and I'll show  you how to go. Before morning we shall be at the end of the world, or  rather, the beginning.\"    \"Where is the beginning of the"]]]
