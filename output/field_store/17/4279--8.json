(As this  first jar contains the air, together with the first portions of the oxygen  set free during the preparation, we will carry it out of the way, and be  prepared to make our experiments in a regular, dignified manner.) And,  inasmuch as that power of making wood, wax, or other things burn, was so  marked in the oxygen we obtained by means of the voltaic battery from  water, we may expect to find the same property here. We will try it You  see there is the combustion of a lighted taper in air, and here is its  combustion in this gas [lowering the taper into the jar]. See how brightly  and how beautifully it burns! You can also see more than this,--you will  perceive it is a heavy gas, whilst the hydrogen would go up like a  balloon, or even faster than a balloon, when not encumbered with the  weight of the envelope.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    You may easily see that although we obtained from water twice as much in  volume of the hydrogen as of oxygen, it does not follow that we have twice  as much in weight--because one is heavy, and the other a very light gas.  We have means of weighing gases or air; but without stopping to explain,  that, let me just tell you what their respective weights are. The weight  of a pint of hydrogen is three-quarters of a grain; the weight of the same  quantity of oxygen is nearly twelve grains. This is a very great  difference. The weight of a cubit foot of hydrogen is one-twelfth of an  ounce; and the weight of a cubit foot of oxygen is one ounce and a third.  And so on we might come to masses of matter which may be weighed in the  balance, and which we can take account of as to hundredweights and as to  tons, as you will see almost immediately.    Now, as regards this very property of oxygen supporting combustion, which  we may compare to air, I will take a piece of candle to shew it you in a  rough way, and the result will be rough. There is our candle burning in  the air: how will it burn in oxygen? I have here a jar of this gas, and I  am about to put it over the candle for you to compare the action of this  gas with that of the air. Why, look at it: it looks something like the  light you saw at the poles of the voltaic battery. Think how vigorous that  action must be! And yet, during all that action, nothing more is produced  than what is produced by the burning of the candle in air. We have the  same production of water, and the same phenomena exactly, when we use this  gas instead of air, as we have when the candle is burnt in air.    But now we have got a knowledge of this new substance, we can look at it a  little more distinctly, in order to satisfy ourselves that we have got a  good general understanding of this part of the product of a candle. It is  wonderful how great the supporting powers of this substance are as regards  combustion. For instance, here is a lamp which, simple though it be, is  the original, I may say, of a great variety of lamps which are constructed  for divers purposes--for light-houses, microscopic illuminations, and  other uses; and if it were proposed to make it burn very brightly, you  would say, \"If a candle burnt better in oxygen, will not a lamp do the  same?\" Why, it will do so. Mr. Anderson will give me a tube coming from  our oxygen reservoir, and I am about to apply it to this flame, which I  will previously make burn badly on purpose. There comes the oxygen: what a  combustion that makes! But if I shut it off, what becomes of the lamp? [The  flow of oxygen was stopped, and the lamp relapsed to its former dimness.]  It is wonderful how, by means of oxygen, we get combustion accelerated.  But it does not affect merely the combustion of hydrogen, or carbon, or  the candle; but it exalts all combustions of the common kind. We will take  one which relates to iron, for instance, as you have already seen iron  burn a little in the atmosphere. Here is a jar of oxygen, and this is a  piece of iron wire; but if it were a bar as thick as my wrist, it would  burn the same.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]    I first attach a little piece of wood to the iron, I then set the wood on  fire and let them both down together into the jar. The wood is now alight,  and there it burns as wood should burn in oxygen; but it will soon  communicate its combustion to the iron. The iron is now burning  brilliantly, and will continue so for a long time. As long as we supply  oxygen, so long can we carry on the combustion of the iron, until the  latter is consumed.    We will now put that on one side, and take some other substance; but we  must limit our experiments, for we have not time to spare for all the  illustrations you would have a right to if we had more time. We will take  a piece of sulphur--you know how sulphur burns in the air--well, we put it  into the oxygen, and you will see that whatever can burn in air, can burn  with a far greater intensity in oxygen, leading you to think that perhaps  the atmosphere itself owes all its power of combustion to this gas. The  sulphur is now burning very quietly in the oxygen; but you cannot for a  moment mistake the very high and increased action which takes place when  it is so burnt, instead of being burnt merely in common air.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    I am now about to shew you the combustion of another  substance--phosphorus. I can do it better for you here than you can do it  at home. This is a very combustible substance; and if it be so combustible  in air, what might you expect it would be in oxygen? I am about to shew it  to you not in its fullest intensity, for if I did so we should almost blow  the apparatus up--I may even now crack the jar, though I do not want to  break things carelessly. You see how it burns in the air. But what a  glorious light it gives out when I introduce it into oxygen! [Introducing  the lighted phosphorus into the jar of oxygen.] There you see the solid  particles going off which cause that combustion to be so brilliantly  luminous.    Thus far we have tested this power of oxygen, and the high combustion it  produces by means of other substances. We must now, for a little while  longer, look at it as respects the hydrogen. You know, when we allowed the  oxygen and the hydrogen derived from the water to mix and burn together,  we had a little explosion. You remember, also, that when I burnt the  oxygen and the hydrogen in a jet together, we got very little light, but  great heat. I am now about to set fire to oxygen and hydrogen, mixed in  the proportion in which they occur in water. Here is a vessel containing  one volume of oxygen and two volumes of hydrogen. This mixture is exactly  of the same nature as the gas we just now obtained from the voltaic  battery: it would be far too much to burn at once; I have therefore  arranged to blow soap-bubbles with it, and burn those bubbles, that we may  see by a general experiment or two how this oxygen supports the combustion  of the hydrogen. First of all, we will see whether we can blow a bubble.  Well, there goes the gas [causing it to issue through a tobacco-pipe into  some soap-suds]. Here I have a bubble. I am receiving them on my hand: and  you will perhaps think I am acting oddly in this experiment; but it is to  shew you that we must not always trust to noise and sounds, but rather to  real facts. [Exploding a bubble on the palm of his hand.] I am afraid to  fire a bubble from the end of the pipe, because the explosion would pass  up into the jar and blow it to pieces. This oxygen then will unite with  the hydrogen, as you see by the phenomena, and hear by the sound, with the  utmost readiness of action, and all its powers are then taken up in its  neutralisation of the qualities of the hydrogen.    So now I think you will perceive the whole history of water with reference  to oxygen and the air, from what we have before said. Why does a piece of  potassium decompose water? Because it finds oxygen in the water. What is  set free when I put it in the water, as I am about to do again? It sets  free hydrogen, and the hydrogen burns; but the potassium itself combines  with oxygen; and this piece of potassium, in taking the water apart--the  water, you may say, derived from the combustion of the candle--takes away  the oxygen which the candle took from the air, and so sets the hydrogen  free; and even if I take a piece of ice, and put a piece of potassium upon  it, the beautiful affinities by which the oxygen and the hydrogen are  related are such, that the ice will absolutely set fire to the potassium.  I shew this to you to-day, in order to enlarge your ideas of these things,  and that you may see how greatly results are modified by circumstances.  There is the potassium on the ice, producing a sort of volcanic action.    It will be my place, when next we meet, having pointed out these anomalous  actions, to shew you that none of these extra and strange effects are met  with by us--that none of these strange and injurious actions take place  when we are burning, not merely a candle, but gas in our streets, or fuel  in our fireplaces, so long as we confine ourselves within the laws that  Nature has made for our guidance.          LECTURE V.    OXYGEN PRESENT IN THE AIR--NATURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE--ITS PROPERTIES--OTHER  PRODUCTS FROM THE CANDLE--CARBONIC ACID--ITS PROPERTIES.      We have now seen that we can produce hydrogen and oxygen from the water  that we obtained from the candle. Hydrogen, you know, comes from the  candle, and oxygen, you believe, comes from the air. But then you have a  right to ask me, \"How is it that the air and the oxygen do not equally  well burn the candle?\" If you remember what happened when I put a jar of  oxygen over a piece of candle, you recollect there was a very different  kind of combustion to that which took place in the air. Now, why is this?  It is a very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14499"],[0,"The Religions of India (#12)"],[1," uses the goad, which,  however, according to Bergaigne, is the thunderbolt! So, too, the cows  that P[=u]shan is described as guiding have been interpreted as clouds  or 'dawns.' But they may be taken without 'interpretation' as  real cows.[32] P[=u]shan drives the cows, he is armed with a goad, and  eats mush; bucolic throughout, yet a sun-god. It is on these lines  that his finding-qualities are to be interpreted. He finds lost  cattle,[33] a proper business for such a god; but Bergaigne will see  in this a transfer from P[=u]shan's finding of rain and of _soma_.[34]  P[=u]shan, too, directs the furrow[35]    Together with Vishnu and Bhaga this god is invoked at sacrifices, (a  fact that says little against or for his original sun-ship),[36] and  he is intimately connected with Indra. His sister is his mistress, and  his mother is his wife (Dawn and Night?) according to the meagre  accounts given in VI. 55. 4-5.[37] As a god of increase he is invoked  in the marriage-rite, X. 85. 37.    As Savitar and all sun-gods are at once luminous and dark, so  P[=u]shan has a clear and again a revered (terrible) appearance; he is  like day and night, like Dyaus (the sky); at one time bright, at  another, plunged in darkness, VI. 58. 1. Quite like Savitar he is the  shining god who \"looks upon all beings and sees them all together\"; he  is the \"lord of the path,\" the god of travellers; he is invoked to  drive away evil spirits, thieves, footpads, and all workers of evil;  he makes paths for the winning of wealth; he herds the stars and  directs all with _soma_. He carries a golden axe or sword, and is  borne through air and water on golden ships; and it is he that lets  down the sun's golden wheel. These simpler attributes appear for the  most part in the early hymns. In what seem to be later hymns, he is  the mighty one who \"carries the thoughts of all\"; he is  like _soma_ (the drink), and attends to the filter; he is \"lord of the  pure\"; the \"one born of old,\" and is especially called upon to help  the poets' hymns.[38] It is here, in the last part of the Rig Veda,  that he appears as [Greek: psuchopompos], who \"goes and returns,\"  escorting the souls of the dead to heaven. He is the sun's messenger,  and is differentiated from Savitar in X. 139. 1.[39] Apparently he was  a god affected most by the Bharadv[=a]ja family (to which is ascribed  the sixth book of the Rig Veda) where his worship was extended more  broadly. He seems to have become the special war-god of this family,  and is consequently invoked with Indra and the Maruts (though this may  have been merely in his rote as sun). The goats, his steeds, are also  an attribute of the Scandinavian war-god Thor (Kaegi, _Rig Veda_, note  210), so that his bucolic character rests more in his goad, food, and  plough.    Bhaga is recognized as an [=A]ditya (luminous deity) and was perhaps a  sun-god of some class, possibly of all, as the name in Slavic is still  kept in the meaning 'god,' literally 'giver.' In the Rig Veda the word  means, also, simply god, as in _bhagabhakta_, 'given by gods'; but as  a name it is well known, and when thus called Bhaga is still the  giver, 'the bestower' _(vidhart[=a])_. As _bhaga_ is also an epithet  of Savitar, the name may not stand for an originally distinct  personality. Bhaga has but one hymn.[40] There is in fact no reason  why Bhaga should be regarded as a sun-god, except for the formal  identification of him as an [=A]ditya, that is as the son of Aditi  (Boundlessness, see below); but neither S[=u]rya nor Savitar is  originally an [=A]ditya, and in Iranic _bagha_ is only an epithet of  Ormuzd.        HYMNS TO P[=U]SHAN AND BHAGA.      To P[=U]SHAN (vi. 56).      The man who P[=u]shan designates    With words like these, 'mush-eater he,'    By him the god is not described.      With P[=u]shan joined in unison    That best of warriors, truest lord,    Indra, the evil demons slays.      'T is he, the best of warriors, drives    The golden chariot of the sun    Among the speckled kine (the clouds).      Whate'er we ask of thee to-day,    O wonder-worker, praised and wise,    Accomplish thou for us that prayer.      And this our band, which hunts for kine,[41]    Successful make for booty's gain;    Afar, O P[=u]shan, art thou praised.      We seek of thee success, which far    From ill, and near to wealth shall be;    For full prosperity to-day;    And full prosperity the morn.[42]        To BHAGA (vii. 41).      Early on Agni call we, early Indra call;    Early call Mitra, Varuna, the Horsemen twain;    Early, too, Bhaga, P[=u]shan, and the Lord of Strength;    And early Soma will we call, and Rudra too.    This stanza has been prefixed to the hymn by virtue of the catch-word  'early' (in the morning), with which really begins this prosaic poem  (in different metre):      The early-conquering mighty Bhaga call we,    The son of Boundlessness, the gift-bestower,[43]    Whom weak and strong, and e'en the king, regarding,    Cry _bhagam bhakshi_, 'give to me the giver.'[44]      O Bhaga, leader Bhaga, true bestower,    O Bhaga, help this prayer, to us give (riches),    O Bhaga, make us grow in kine and horses,    O Bhaga, eke in men, men-wealthy be we!      And now may we be rich, be _bhaga_-holders,[45]    Both at the (day's) approach, and eke at midday,    And at the sun's departure, generous giver.    The favor of the gods may we abide in.      O gods, (to us) be Bhaga really _bhaga_,[46]    By means of him may we be _bhaga_-holders.    As such an one do all, O Bhaga, call thee,    As such, O Bhaga, be to-day our leader.      May dawns approach the sacrifice, the holy    Place, like to Dadhikr[=a],[47] like horses active,    Which bring a chariot near; so, leading Bhaga,    Who finds good things, may they approach, and bring him.    As this is the only hymn addressed to Bhaga, and as it proves itself  to have been made for altar service (in style as well as in special  mention of the ceremony), it is evident that Bhaga, although called  Aditi's son, is but a god of wealth and (like Anca, the Apportioner)  very remotely connected with physical functions. But the hymn appears  to be so late that it cannot throw much light on the original  conception of the deity. We rather incline to doubt whether Bhaga was  ever, strictly speaking, a sun-god, and think that he was made so  merely because the sun (Savitar) was called _bhaga_. A (Greek: Zehys)  Bagaios was worshipped by the Phrygians, while in the Avesta and as a  Slavic god Bhaga has no especial connection with the sun. It must be  acknowledged, however, that every form of the sun-god is especially  lauded for generosity.      VISHNU.    In the person of Vishnu the sun is extolled under another name, which  in the period of the Rig Veda was still in the dawn of its glory. The  hymns to Vishnu are few; his fame rests chiefly on the three strides  with which he crosses heaven, on his making fast the earth, and on his  munificence.[48] He, too, leads in battle and is revered under the  title Cipivishta,[49] of unknown significance, but meaning literally  'bald.' Like Savitar he has three spaces, two called earthly, and one,  the highest, known only to himself. His greatness is inconceivable,  and he is especially praised with Indra, the two being looked upon as  masters of the world.[50] His highest place is the realm of the  departed spirits.[51] The hymns to him appear to be late (thus I. 155.  6, where, as the year, he has four seasons of ninety days each). Like  P[=u]shan (his neighbor in many lauds) he is associated in a late hymn  with the Maruts (V. 87). His later popularity lies in the importance  of his 'highest place' (or step) being the home of the departed  spirits, where he himself dwells, inscrutable. This led to the  spirit's union with the sun, which, as we have said, is one of the  first phases of the pantheistic doctrine. In the family-books Vishnu  gets but two hymns, both in the same collection, and shares one more  with Indra (VII. 99-100; VI. 69). In some of the family-collections,  notably in that of the Visvamitras, he is, if not unknown, almost  ignored. As Indra's friend he is most popular with the Kanva family,  but even here he has no special hymn.      None born, God Vishnu, and none born hereafter    E'er reaches to the limit of thy greatness;    Twas thou establish'st yon high vault of heaven,    Thou madest fast the earth's extremest mountain. (VII. 99. 2.)      Three steps he made, the herdsman sure,    Vishnu, and stepped across (the world). (I. 22. i8.)      The mighty deeds will I proclaim of Vishnu,    Who measured out the earth's extremest spaces,    And fastened firm the highest habitation,    Thrice stepping out with step all-powerful.      O would that I might reach his path beloved,    Where joy the men who hold the gods in honor. (I. 154. 1, 5.)    Under all these names and images the sun is worshipped. And it is  necessary to review them all to see how deeply the worship is  ingrained. The sun is one of the most venerable as he is the most  enduring of India's nature-gods.[52] In no early passage is the sun a  malignant god. He comes \"as kine to the village, as a hero to his  steed, as a calf to the cow, as a husband to his wife.\"[53] He is the  'giver,' the 'generous one,' and as such he is Mitra, 'the friend,'  who with Varuna, the encompassing heaven, is, indeed, in the Rig Veda,  a personality subordinated to his greater comrade; yet is this,  perhaps, the sun's oldest name of those that are not descriptive of  purely physical characteristics. For Mithra in Persian keeps the  proof that this title was given to the Indo-Iranic god before the  separation of the two peoples. It is therefore (perhaps with Bhaga?)  one of the most ancient personal designations of the sun,--one,  perhaps, developed from a mere name into a separate deity.      HEAVEN AND EARTH.    Not only as identical with the chief god of the Greeks, but also from  a native "]]]
