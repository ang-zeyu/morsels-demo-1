The bales of cotton cloth, the beads, the brass  wire, the bottles of rum, had not been spirited away in the night. So  far so good. The faithful servant of his employers was now at liberty  to care for his own interests. He regarded himself, passing his hands  over his skin.    \"Hi! Mahamo!\" he shouted. \"I've been eaten up.\"    The islander, with one sinuous motion, sprang from the ground, through  the mouth of the hut. Then, after a glance, he threw high his hands in  thanks to such good and evil spirits as had charge of his concerns. In  a tone half of reproach, half of apology, he murmured--    \"You white men sometimes say strange things that deceive the heart.\"    \"Reach me that ammonia bottle, d'you hear?\" answered the white man.  \"This is a pretty place you've brought me to!\" He took a draught.  \"Christmas Day, too! Of all the ---- But I suppose it seems all right  to you, you funny blackamoor, to be here on Christmas Day?\"    \"We are here on the day appointed, Mr. Williams. It is a feast-day of  your people?\"    Mr. Williams had lain back, with closed eyes, on his mat. Nostalgia  was doing duty to him for imagination. He was wafted to a bedroom in  Marylebone, where in honour of the Day he lay late dozing, with great  contentment; outside, a slush of snow in the street, the sound of  church-bells; from below a savour of especial cookery. \"Yes,\" he said,  \"it's a feast-day of my people.\"    \"Of mine also,\" said the islander humbly.    \"Is it though? But they'll do business first?\"    \"They must first do that.\"    \"And they'll bring their ivory with them?\"    \"Every man will bring ivory,\" answered the islander, with a smile  gleaming and wide.    \"How soon'll they be here?\"    \"Has not the sun risen? They are on their way.\"    \"Well, I hope they'll hurry. The sooner we're off this cursed island  of yours the better. Take all those things out,\" Mr. Williams added,  pointing to the merchandise, \"and arrange them--neatly, mind you!\"    In certain circumstances it is right that a man be humoured in  trifles. Mahamo, having borne out the merchandise, arranged it very  neatly.    While Mr. Williams made his toilet, the sun and the forest, careless  of the doings of white and black men alike, waged their warfare  implacable and daily. The forest from its inmost depths sent forth  perpetually its legions of shadows that fell dead in the instant  of exposure to the enemy whose rays heroic and absurd its outposts  annihilated. There came from those inilluminable depths the equable  rumour of myriads of winged things and crawling things newly roused to  the task of killing and being killed. Thence detached itself, little  by little, an insidious sound of a drum beaten. This sound drew more  near.    Mr. Williams, issuing from the hut, heard it, and stood gaping towards  it.    \"Is that them?\" he asked.    \"That is they,\" the islander murmured, moving away towards the edge of  the forest.    Sounds of chanting were a now audible accompaniment to the drum.    \"What's that they're singing?\" asked Mr. Williams.    \"They sing of their business,\" said Mahamo.    \"Oh!\" Mr. Williams was slightly shocked. \"I'd have thought they'd be  singing of their feast.\"    \"It is of their feast they sing.\"    It has been stated that Mr. Williams was not imaginative. But a few  years of life in climates alien and intemperate had disordered his  nerves. There was that in the rhythms of the hymn which made bristle  his flesh.    Suddenly, when they were very near, the voices ceased, leaving a  legacy of silence more sinister than themselves. And now the black  spaces between the trees were relieved by bits of white that were the  eyeballs and teeth of Mahamo's brethren.    \"It was of their feast, it was of you, they sang,\" said Mahamo.    \"Look here,\" cried Mr. Williams in his voice of a man not to be  trifled with. \"Look here, if you've--\"    He was silenced by sight of what seemed to be a young sapling sprung  up from the ground within a yard of him--a young sapling tremulous,  with a root of steel. Then a thread-like shadow skimmed the air, and  another spear came impinging the ground within an inch of his feet.    As he turned in his flight he saw the goods so neatly arranged at  his orders, and there flashed through him, even in the thick of the  spears, the thought that he would be a grave loss to his employers.  This--for Mr. Williams was, not less than the goods, of a kind easily  replaced--was an illusion. It was the last of Mr. Williams illusions.          A RECOLLECTION    _By_    EDM*ND G*SSE                  \"And let us strew    Twain wreaths of holly and of yew.\"                                   WALLER.      One out of many Christmas Days abides with peculiar vividness in my  memory. In setting down, however clumsily, some slight record of  it, I feel that I shall be discharging a duty not only to the two  disparately illustrious men who made it so very memorable, but also to  all young students of English and Scandinavian literature. My use of  the first person singular, delightful though that pronoun is in the  works of the truly gifted, jars unspeakably on me; but reasons of  space baulk my sober desire to call myself merely the present writer,  or the infatuated go-between, or the cowed and imponderable young  person who was in attendance.    In the third week of December, 1878, taking the opportunity of a brief  and undeserved vacation, I went to Venice. On the morning after my  arrival, in answer to a most kind and cordial summons, I presented  myself at the Palazzo Rezzonico. Intense as was the impression he  always made even in London, I think that those of us who met Robert  Browning only in the stress and roar of that metropolis can hardly  have gauged the fullness of his potentialities for impressing. Venice,  \"so weak, so quiet,\" as Mr. Ruskin had called her, was indeed the  ideal setting for one to whom neither of those epithets could by any  possibility have been deemed applicable. The steamboats that now wake  the echoes of the canals had not yet been imported; but the vitality  of the imported poet was in some measure a preparation for them. It  did not, however, find me quite prepared for itself, and I am afraid  that some minutes must have elapsed before I could, as it were, find  my feet in the torrent of his geniality and high spirits, and give him  news of his friends in London.    He was at that time engaged in revising the proof-sheets of \"Dramatic  Idylls,\" and after luncheon, to which he very kindly bade me remain,  he read aloud certain selected passages. The yellow haze of a wintry  Venetian sunshine poured in through the vast windows of his _salone_,  making an aureole around his silvered head. I would give much to  live that hour over again. But it was vouchsafed in days before the  Browning Society came and made everything so simple for us all. I am  afraid that after a few minutes I sat enraptured by the sound rather  than by the sense of the lines. I find, in the notes I made of the  occasion, that I figured myself as plunging through some enchanted  thicket on the back of an inspired bull.    That evening, as I was strolling in Piazza San Marco, my thoughts  of Browning were all of a sudden scattered by the vision of a small,  thick-set man seated at one of the tables in the Cafe Florian. This  was--and my heart leapt like a young trout when I saw that it could be  none other than--Henrik Ibsen. Whether joy or fear was the predominant  emotion in me, I should be hard put to it to say. It had been my  privilege to correspond extensively with the great Scandinavian, and  to be frequently received by him, some years earlier than the date of  which I write, in Rome. In that city haunted by the shades of so many  Emperors and Popes I had felt comparatively at ease even in Ibsen's  presence. But seated here in the homelier decay of Venice, closely  buttoned in his black surcoat and crowned with his uncompromising  top-hat, with the lights of the Piazza flashing back wanly from his  gold-rimmed spectacles, and his lips tight-shut like some steel trap  into which our poor humanity had just fallen, he seemed to constitute  a menace under which the boldest might well quail. Nevertheless,  I took my courage in both hands, and laid it as a kind of votive  offering on the little table before him.    My reward was in the surprising amiability that he then and afterwards  displayed. My travelling had indeed been doubly blessed, for, whilst  my subsequent afternoons were spent in Browning's presence, my  evenings fell with regularity into the charge of Ibsen. One of these  evenings is for me \"prouder, more laurel'd than the rest\" as having  been the occasion when he read to me the MS. of a play which he had  just completed. He was staying at the Hotel Danieli, an edifice famous  for having been, rather more than forty years previously, the socket  in which the flame of an historic _grande passion_ had finally sunk  and guttered out with no inconsiderable accompaniment of smoke and  odour. It was there, in an upper room, that I now made acquaintance  with a couple very different from George Sand and Alfred de Musset,  though destined to become hardly less famous than they. I refer to  Torvald and Nora Helmer. My host read to me with the utmost vivacity,  standing in the middle of the apartment; and I remember that in  the scene where Nora Helmer dances the tarantella her creator  instinctively executed a few illustrative steps.    During those days I felt very much as might a minnow swimming to and  fro between Leviathan on the one hand and Behemoth on the other--a  minnow tremulously pleased, but ever wistful for some means of  bringing his two enormous acquaintances together. On the afternoon of  December 24th I confided to Browning my aspiration. He had never heard  of this brother poet and dramatist, whose fame indeed was at that time  still mainly Boreal; but he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14672"],[0,"The Religion of the Ancient Celts (#12)"],[1,"eat, some of  them going to Scotland or Man (the Britons), some to Greece (to return  as the Firbolgs), some to the north, where they learned magic and  returned as the Tuatha De Danann.[163] The Firbolgs, \"men of bags,\"  resenting their ignominious treatment by the Greeks, escaped to Ireland.  They included the Firbolgs proper, the Fir-Domnann, and the  Galioin.[164] The Fomorians are called their gods, and this, with the  contemptuous epithets bestowed on them, may point to the fact that the  Firbolgs were the pre-Celtic folk of Ireland and the Fomorians their  divinities, hostile to the gods of the Celts or regarded as dark  deities. The Firbolgs are vassals of Ailill and Medb, and with the Fir  Domnann and Galioin are hostile to Cuchulainn and his men,[165] just as  Fomorians were to the Tuatha De Danann. The strifes of races and of  their gods are inextricably confused.    The Tuatha De Danann arrived from heaven--an idea in keeping with their  character as beneficent gods, but later legend told how they came from  the north. They reached Ireland on Beltane, shrouded in a magic mist,  and finally, after one or, in other accounts, two battles, defeated the  Firbolgs and Fomorians at Magtured. The older story of one battle may be  regarded as a euhemerised account of the seeming conflict of nature  powers.[166] The first battle is described in a fifteenth to sixteenth  century MS.,[167] and is referred to in a fifteenth century account of  the second battle, full of archaic reminiscences, and composed from  various earlier documents.[168] The Firbolgs, defeated in the first  battle, join the Fomorians, after great losses. Meanwhile Nuada, leader  of the Tuatha De Danann, lost his hand, and as no king with a blemish  could sit on the throne, the crown was given to Bres, son of the  Fomorian Elatha and his sister Eri, a woman of the Tuatha De Danann. One  day Eri espied a silver boat speeding to her across the sea. From it  stepped forth a magnificent hero, and without delay the pair, like the  lovers in Theocritus, \"rejoiced in their wedlock.\" The hero, Elatha,  foretold the birth of Eri's son, so beautiful that he would be a  standard by which to try all beautiful things. He gave her his ring, but  she was to part with it only to one whose finger it should fit. This was  her child Bres, and by this token he was later, as an exile, recognised  by his father, and obtained his help against the Tuatha De Danann. Like  other wonderful children, Bres grew twice as quickly as any other child  until he was seven.[169] Though Elatha and Eri are brother and sister,  she is among the Tuatha De Danann.[170] There is the usual inconsistency  of myth here and in other accounts of Fomorian and Tuatha De Danann  unions. The latter had just landed, but already had united in marriage  with the Fomorians. This inconsistency escaped the chroniclers, but it  points to the fact that both were divine not human, and that, though in  conflict, they united in marriage as members of hostile tribes often do.    The second battle took place twenty-seven years after the first, on  Samhain. It was fought like the first on the plain of Mag-tured, though  later accounts made one battle take place at Mag-tured in Mayo, the  other at Mag-tured in Sligo.[171] Inconsistently, the conquering Tuatha  De Danann in the interval, while Bres is their king, must pay tribute  imposed by the Fomorians. Obviously in older accounts this tribute must  have been imposed before the first battle and have been its cause. But  why should gods, like the Tuatha De Danann, ever have been in  subjection? This remains to be seen, but the answer probably lies in  parallel myths of the subjection or death of divinities like Ishtar,  Adonis, Persephone, and Osiris. Bres having exacted a tribute of the  milk of all hornless dun cows, the cows of Ireland were passed through  fire and smeared with ashes--a myth based perhaps on the Beltane fire  ritual.[172] The avaricious Bres was satirised, and \"nought but decay  was on him from that hour,\"[173] and when Nuada, having recovered,  claimed the throne, he went to collect an army of the Fomorians, who  assembled against the Tuatha De Danann. In the battle Indech wounded  Ogma, and Balor slew Nuada, but was mortally wounded by Lug. Thereupon  the Fomorians fled to their own region.    The Tuatha De Danann remained masters of Ireland until the coming of the  Milesians, so named from an eponymous Mile, son of Bile. Ith, having  been sent to reconnoitre, was slain, and the Milesians now invaded  Ireland in force. In spite of a mist raised by the Druids, they landed,  and, having met the three princes who slew Ith, demanded instant battle  or surrender of the land. The princes agreed to abide by the decision of  the Milesian poet Amairgen, who bade his friends re-embark and retire  for the distance of nine waves. If they could then effect a landing,  Ireland was theirs. A magic storm was raised, which wrecked many of  their ships, but Amairgen recited verses, fragments, perhaps, of some  old ritual, and overcame the dangers. After their defeat the survivors  of the Tuatha De Danann retired into the hills to become a fairy folk,  and the Milesians (the Goidels or Scots) became ancestors of the Irish.    Throughout the long story of the conquests of Ireland there are many  reduplications, the same incidents being often ascribed to different  personages.[174] Different versions of similar occurrences, based on  older myths and traditions, may already have been in existence, and  ritual practices, dimly remembered, required explanation. In the hands  of the chroniclers, writing history with a purpose and combining their  information with little regard to consistency, all this was reduced to a  more or less connected narrative. At the hands of the prosaic  chroniclers divinity passed from the gods, though traces of it still  linger.      \"Ye are gods, and, behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at       last.     In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of       things,     Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for       kings.\"    From the annalistic point of view the Fomorians are sea demons or  pirates, their name being derived from _muir_, \"sea,\" while they are  descended along with other monstrous beings from them. Professor  Rh[^y]s, while connecting the name with Welsh _foawr_, \"giant\" (Gaelic  _famhair_), derives the name from _fo_, \"under,\" and _muir_, and regards  them as submarine beings.[175] Dr. MacBain connected them with the  fierce powers of the western sea personified, like the _Muireartach_, a  kind of sea hag, of a Fionn ballad.[176] But this association of the  Fomorians with the ocean may be the result of a late folk-etymology,  which wrongly derived their name from _muir_. The Celtic experience of  the Lochlanners or Norsemen, with whom the Fomorians are  associated,[177] would aid the conception of them as sea-pirates of a  more or less demoniacal character. Dr. Stokes connects the second  syllable _mor_ with _mare_ in \"nightmare,\" from _moro_, and regards them  as subterranean as well as submarine.[178] But the more probable  derivation is that of Zimmer and D'Arbois, from _fo_ and _morio_ (_mor_,  \"great\"),[179] which would thus agree with the tradition which regarded  them as giants. They were probably beneficent gods of the aborigines,  whom the Celtic conquerors regarded as generally evil, perhaps equating  them with the dark powers already known to them. They were still  remembered as gods, and are called \"champions of the _sid_,\" like the  Tuatha De Danann.[180] Thus King Bres sought to save his life by  promising that the kine of Ireland would always be in milk, then that  the men of Ireland would reap every quarter, and finally by revealing  the lucky days for ploughing, sowing, and reaping.[181] Only an  autochthonous god could know this, and the story is suggestive of the  true nature of the Fomorians. The hostile character attributed to them  is seen from the fact that they destroyed corn, milk, and fruit. But in  Ireland, as elsewhere, this destructive power was deprecated by begging  them not to destroy \"corn nor milk in Erin beyond their fair  tribute.\"[182] Tribute was also paid to them on Samhain, the time when  the powers of blight feared by men are in the ascendant. Again, the  kingdom of Balor, their chief, is still described as the kingdom of  cold.[183] But when we remember that a similar \"tribute\" was paid to  Cromm Cruaich, a god of fertility, and that after the conquest of the  Tuatha De Danann they also were regarded as hostile to agriculture,[184]  we realise that the Fomorians must have been aboriginal gods of  fertility whom the conquering Celts regarded as hostile to them and  their gods. Similarly, in folk-belief the beneficent corn-spirit has  sometimes a sinister and destructive aspect.[185] Thus the stories of  \"tribute\" would be distorted reminiscences of the ritual of gods of the  soil, differing little in character from that of the similar Celtic  divinities. What makes it certain that the Fomorians were aboriginal  gods is that they are found in Ireland before the coming of the early  colonist Partholan. They were the gods of the pre-Celtic folk--Firbolgs,  Fir Domnann, and Galioin[186]--all of them in Ireland before the Tuatha  De Danaan arrived, and all of them regarded as slaves, spoken of with  the utmost contempt. Another possibility, however, ought to be  considered. As the Celtic gods were local in character, and as groups of  tribes would frequently be hostile to other groups, the Fomorians may  have been local gods of a group at enmity with another group,  worshipping the Tuatha De Danaan.    The strife of Fomorians and Tuatha De Danann suggests the dualism of all  nature religions. Demons or giants or monsters strive with gods in  Hindu, Greek, and Teutonic mythology, and in Persia the primitive  "]]]
