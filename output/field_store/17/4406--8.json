No more shall all the rest prosper who change the open free market into  a carrion-pit of extortion and a den of robbery, where the poor are  daily overcharged, new burdens and high prices are imposed, and every  one uses the market according to his caprice, and is even defiant and  brags as though it were his fair privilege and right to sell his goods  for as high a price as he please, and no one had a right to say a word  against it. We will indeed look on and let these people skin, pinch,  and hoard, but we will trust in God -- who will, however, do this of  His own accord, -- that, after you have been skinning and scraping for  a long time, He will pronounce such a blessing on your gains that your  grain in the garner, your beer in the cellar, your cattle in the stalls  shall perish; yea, where you have cheated and overcharged any one to  the amount of a florin, your entire pile shall be consumed with rust,  so that you shall never enjoy it.    And indeed, we see and experience this being fulfilled daily before our  eyes, that no stolen or dishonestly acquired possession thrives. How  many there are who rake and scrape day and night, and yet grow not a  farthing richer! And though they gather much, they must suffer so many  plagues and misfortunes that they cannot relish it with cheerfulness  nor transmit it to their children. But as no one minds it, and we go on  as though it did not concern us, God must visit us in a different way  and teach us manners by imposing one taxation after another, or  billeting a troop of soldiers upon us, who in one hour empty our  coffers and purses, and do not quit as long as we have a farthing  left, and in addition, by way of thanks, burn and devastate house and  home, and outrage and kill wife and children.    And, in short, if you steal much, depend upon it that again as much  will be stolen from you; and he who robs and acquires with violence and  wrong will submit to one who shall deal after the same fashion with  him. For God is master of this art, that since every one robs and  steals from the other, He punishes one thief by means of another. Else  where should we find enough gallows and ropes?    Now, whoever is willing to be instructed let him know that this is the  commandment of God, and that it must not be treated as a jest. For  although you despise us, defraud, steal, and rob, we will indeed manage  to endure your haughtiness, suffer, and, according to the Lord's  Prayer, forgive and show pity; for we know that the godly shall  nevertheless have enough, and you injure yourself more than another.    But beware of this: When the poor man comes to you (of whom there are  so many now) who must buy with the penny of his daily wages and live  upon it, and you are harsh to him, as though every one lived by your  favor, and you skin and scrape to the bone, and, besides, with pride  and haughtiness turn him off to whom you ought to give for nothing, he  will go away wretched and sorrowful, and since he can complain to no  one he will cry and call to heaven, -- then beware (I say again) as of  the devil himself. For such groaning and calling will be no jest, but  will have a weight that will prove too heavy for you and all the  world. For it will reach Him who takes care of the poor sorrowful  hearts, and will not allow them to go unavenged. But if you despise  this and become defiant, see whom you have brought upon you: if you  succeed and prosper, you may before all the world call God and me a  liar.    We have exhorted, warned, and protested enough; he who will not heed or  believe it may go on until he learns this by experience Yet it must be  impressed upon the young that they may be careful not to follow the old  lawless crowd, but keep their eyes fixed upon God's commandment, lest  His wrath and punishment come upon them too. It behooves us to do no  more than to instruct and reprove with God's Word; but to check such  open wantonness there is need of the princes and government, who  themselves would have eyes and the courage to establish and maintain  order in all manner of trade and commerce, lest the poor be burdened  and oppressed nor they themselves be loaded with other men's sins.    Let this suffice as an explanation of what stealing is, that it be not  taken too narrowly but made to extend as far as we have to do with our  neighbors. And briefly, in a summary, as in the former commandments, it  is herewith forbidden, in the first place, to do our neighbor any  injury or wrong (in whatever manner supposable, by curtailing,  forestalling, and withholding his possessions and property), or even to  consent or allow such a thing, but to interpose and prevent it. And, on  the other hand, it is commanded that we advance and improve his  possessions, and in case he suffers want, that we help, communicate,  and lend both to friends and foes.    Whoever now seeks and desires good works will find here more than  enough such as are heartily acceptable and pleasing to God, and in  addition are favored and crowned with excellent blessings, that we are  to be richly compensated for all that we do for our neighbor's good and  from friendship; as King Solomon also teaches Prov. 19, 17: He that  hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath  given will He pay him again. Here, then you have a rich Lord, who is  certainly sufficient for you, and who will not suffer you to come short  in anything or to want; thus you can with a joyful conscience enjoy a  hundred times more than you could scrape together with unfaithfulness  and wrong. Now, whoever does not desire the blessing will find wrath  and misfortune enough.    The Eighth Commandment.    Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.    Over and above our own body, spouse, and temporal possessions, we have  yet another treasure, namely, honor and good report [the illustrious  testimony of an upright and unsullied name and reputation], with which  we cannot dispense. For it is intolerable to live among men in open  shame and general contempt. Therefore God wishes the reputation, good  name, and upright character of our neighbor to be taken away or  diminished as little as his money and possessions, that every one may  stand in his integrity before wife, children, servants, and neighbors.  And in the first place, we take the plainest meaning of this  commandment according to the words (Thou shalt not bear false witness),  as pertaining to the public courts of justice, where a poor innocent  man is accused and oppressed by false witnesses in order to be punished  in his body, property, or honor.    Now, this appears as if it were of little concern to us at present; but  with the Jews it was quite a common and ordinary matter. For the people  were organized under an excellent and regular government; and where  there is still such a government, instances of this sin will not be  wanting. The cause of it is that where judges, burgomasters, princes,  or others in authority sit in judgment, things never fail to go  according to the course of the world; namely, men do not like to offend  anybody, flatter, and speak to gain favor, money, prospects, or  friendship; and in consequence a poor man and his cause must be  oppressed, denounced as wrong, and suffer punishment. And it is a  common calamity in the world that in courts of justice there seldom  preside godly men.    For to be a judge requires above all things a godly man, and not only a  godly, but also a wise, modest, yea, a brave and bold man; likewise, to  be a witness requires a fearless and especially a godly man. For a  person who is to judge all matters rightly and carry them through with  his decision will often offend good friends, relatives, neighbors, and  the rich and powerful, who can greatly serve or injure him. Therefore  he must be quite blind, have his eyes and ears closed, neither see nor  hear, but go straight forward in everything that comes before him, and  decide accordingly.    Therefore this commandment is given first of all that every one shall  help his neighbor to secure his rights, and not allow them to be  hindered or twisted, but shall promote and strictly maintain them, no  matter whether he be judge or witness, and let it pertain to whatsoever  it will. And especially is a goal set up here for our jurists that they  be careful to deal truly and uprightly with every case, allowing right  to remain right, and, on the other hand, not perverting anything [by  their tricks and technical points turning black into white and making  wrong out to be right], nor glossing it over or keeping silent  concerning it, irrespective of a person's money, possession, honor, or  power. This is one part and the plainest sense of this commandment  concerning all that takes place in court.    Next, it extends very much further, if we are to apply it to spiritual  jurisdiction or administration; here it is a common occurrence that  every one bears false witness against his neighbor. For wherever there  are godly preachers and Christians, they must bear the sentence before  the world that they are called heretics, apostates, yea, seditious and  desperately wicked miscreants. Besides the Word of God must suffer in  the most shameful and malicious manner, being persecuted blasphemed,  contradicted, perverted and falsely cited and interpreted. But let this  pass; for it is the way of the blind world that she condemns and  persecutes the truth and the children of God, and yet esteems it no  sin.    In the third place, what concerns us all, this commandment forbids all  sins of the tongue whereby we may injure or approach too closely to our  neighbor. For to bear false witness is nothing else than a work of the  tongue. Now, whatever is done with the tongue against a fellow-man God  would have prohibited, whether it be false preachers with their  doctrine and blasphemy, false"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#12)"],[1,"), in that time he  conveyed himself and all his family out of the house, and left the nurse  and the watchman to bury the poor wench, that is, throw her into the  cart, and take care of the house.    Not far from the same place they blowed up a watchman with gunpowder,  and burned the poor fellow dreadfully; and while he made hideous cries,  and nobody would venture to come near to help him, the whole family that  were able to stir got out at the windows (one story high), two that were  left sick calling out for help. Care was taken to give them nurses to  look after them; but the persons fled were never found till, after the  plague was abated, they returned. But as nothing could be proved, so  nothing could be done to them.    In other cases, some had gardens and walls, or pales,[100] between them  and their neighbors, or yards and backhouses; and these, by friendship  and entreaties, would get leave to get over those walls or pales, and  so go out at their neighbors' doors, or, by giving money to their  servants, get them to let them through in the night. So that, in short,  the shutting up of houses was in no wise to be depended upon; neither  did it answer the end at all, serving more to make the people desperate,  and drive them to such extremities as that they would break out at all  adventures.    And that which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the  infection farther, by their wandering about with the distemper upon them  in their desperate circumstances, than they would otherwise have done;  for whoever considers all the particulars in such cases must  acknowledge, and cannot doubt, but the severity of those confinements  made many people desperate, and made them run out of their houses at all  hazards, and with the plague visibly upon them, not knowing either  whither to go, or what to do, or indeed what they did. And many that did  so were driven to dreadful exigencies and extremities, and perished in  the streets or fields for mere want, or dropped down by[101] the raging  violence of the fever upon them. Others wandered into the country, and  went forward any way, as their desperation guided them, not knowing  whither they went or would go, till, faint and tired, and not getting  any relief, the houses and villages on the road refusing to admit them  to lodge, whether infected or no, they have perished by the roadside, or  gotten into barns, and died there, none daring to come to them or  relieve them, though perhaps not infected, for nobody would believe  them.    On the other hand, when the plague at first seized a family, that is to  say, when any one body of the family had gone out, and unwarily or  otherwise catched[102] the distemper and brought it home, it was  certainly known by the family before it was known to the officers, who,  as you will see by the order, were appointed to examine into the  circumstances of all sick persons, when they heard of their being sick.    In this interval, between their being taken sick and the examiners  coming, the master of the house had leisure and liberty to remove  himself, or all his family, if he knew whither to go; and many did so.  But the great disaster was, that many did thus after they were really  infected themselves, and so carried the disease into the houses of those  who were so hospitable as to receive them; which, it must be confessed,  was very cruel and ungrateful.    I am speaking now of people made desperate by the apprehensions of their  being shut up, and their breaking out by stratagem or force, either  before or after they were shut up, whose misery was not lessened when  they were out, but sadly increased. On the other hand, many who thus got  away had retreats to go to, and other houses, where they locked  themselves up, and kept hid till the plague was over; and many families,  foreseeing the approach of the distemper, laid up stores of provisions  sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so  entirely, that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was  quite ceased, and then came abroad sound and well. I might recollect  several such as these, and give you the particulars of their management;  for doubtless it was the most effectual secure step that could be taken  for such whose circumstances would not admit them to remove, or who had  not retreats abroad proper for the case; for, in being thus shut up,  they were as if they had been a hundred miles off. Nor do I remember  that any one of those families miscarried.[103] Among these, several  Dutch merchants were particularly remarkable, who kept their houses like  little garrisons besieged, suffering none to go in or out, or come near  them; particularly one in a court in Throckmorton Street, whose house  looked into Drapers' Garden.    But I come back to the case of families infected, and shut up by the  magistrates. The misery of those families is not to be expressed; and it  was generally in such houses that we heard the most dismal shrieks and  outcries of the poor people, terrified, and even frightened to death,  by the sight of the condition of their dearest relations, and by the  terror of being imprisoned as they were.    I remember, and while I am writing this story I think I hear the very  sound of it: a certain lady had an only daughter, a young maiden about  nineteen years old, and who was possessed of a very considerable  fortune. They were only lodgers in the house where they were. The young  woman, her mother, and the maid had been abroad on some occasion, I do  not remember what, for the house was not shut up; but about two hours  after they came home, the young lady complained she was not well; in a  quarter of an hour more she vomited, and had a violent pain in her head.  \"Pray God,\" says her mother, in a terrible fright, \"my child has not the  distemper!\" The pain in her head increasing, her mother ordered the bed  to be warmed, and resolved to put her to bed, and prepared to give her  things to sweat, which was the ordinary remedy to be taken when the  first apprehensions of the distemper began.    While the bed was airing, the mother undressed the young woman, and just  as she was laid down in the bed, she, looking upon her body with a  candle, immediately discovered the fatal tokens on the inside of her  thighs. Her mother, not being able to contain herself, threw down her  candle, and screeched out in such a frightful manner, that it was enough  to place horror upon the stoutest heart in the world. Nor was it one  scream, or one cry, but, the fright having seized her spirits, she  fainted first, then recovered, then ran all over the house (up the  stairs and down the stairs) like one distracted, and indeed really was  distracted, and continued screeching and crying out for several hours,  void of all sense, or at least government of her senses, and, as I was  told, never came thoroughly to herself again. As to the young maiden,  she was a dead corpse from that moment: for the gangrene, which  occasions the spots, had spread over her whole body, and she died in  less than two hours. But still the mother continued crying out, not  knowing anything more of her child, several hours after she was dead.  It is so long ago that I am not certain, but I think the mother never  recovered, but died in two or three weeks after.    I have by me a story of two brothers and their kinsman, who, being  single men, but that had staid[104] in the city too long to get away,  and, indeed, not knowing where to go to have any retreat, nor having  wherewith to travel far, took a course for their own preservation,  which, though in itself at first desperate, yet was so natural that it  may be wondered that no more did so at that time. They were but of mean  condition, and yet not so very poor as that they could not furnish  themselves with some little conveniences, such as might serve to keep  life and soul together; and finding the distemper increasing in a  terrible manner, they resolved to shift as well as they could, and to be  gone.    One of them had been a soldier in the late wars,[105] and before that in  the Low Countries;[106] and having been bred to no particular employment  but his arms, and besides, being wounded, and not able to work very  hard, had for some time been employed at a baker's of sea biscuit, in  Wapping.    The brother of this man was a seaman too, but somehow or other had been  hurt of[107] one leg, that he could not go to sea, but had worked for  his living at a sailmaker's in Wapping or thereabouts, and, being a good  husband,[108] had laid up some money, and was the richest of the three.    The third man was a joiner or carpenter by trade, a handy fellow, and he  had no wealth but his box or basket of tools, with the help of which he  could at any time get his living (such a time as this excepted) wherever  he went; and he lived near Shadwell.    They all lived in Stepney Parish, which, as I have said, being the last  that was infected, or at least violently, they staid there till they  evidently saw the plague was abating at the west part of the town, and  coming towards the east, where they lived.    The story of those three men, if the reader will be content to have me  give it in their own persons, without taking upon me to either vouch the  particulars or answer for any mistakes, I shall give as distinctly as I  can, believing the history will be a very good pattern for any poor man  to follow in case the like public desolation should happen here. And if  there may be no such occasion, (which God of his infinite mercy grant  us!) still the story may have its uses so many ways as that it will, I  hope, never be said that the relating has been unprofitable.    I say all this previous to the history, having yet, for the present,  much more to say before I quit my own part.    I went all the first part of the time freely about the streets, though  not so freely as to run myself into "]]]
