But do thou send this man upon his way with thy  chariot and thy son, since he hath come to thy house, and  give him horses the lightest of foot and chief in  strength.'    Therewith grey-eyed Athene departed in the semblance of a  sea-eagle; and amazement fell on all that saw it, and the  old man he marvelled when his eyes beheld it. And he took  the hand of Telemachus and spake and hailed him:    'My friend, methinks that thou wilt in no sort be a coward  and a weakling, if indeed in thy youth the gods thus follow  with thee to be thy guides. For truly this is none other of  those who keep the mansions of Olympus, save only the  daughter of Zeus, the driver of the spoil, the maiden  Trito-born, she that honoured thy good father too among the  Argives. Nay be gracious, queen, and vouchsafe a goodly  fame to me, even to me and to my sons and to my wife  revered. And I in turn will sacrifice to thee a yearling  heifer, broad of brow, unbroken, which man never yet hath  led beneath the yoke. Such an one will I offer to thee, and  gild her horns with gold.'    Even so he spake in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.  Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, led them, even  his sons and the husbands of his daughters, to his own fair  house. But when they had reached this prince's famous  halls, they sat down all orderly on seats and high chairs;  and when they were come, the old man mixed well for them a  bowl of sweet wine, which now in the eleventh year from the  vintaging the housewife opened, and unloosed the string  that fastened the lid. The old man let mix a bowl thereof,  and prayed instantly to Athene as he poured forth before  her, even to the daughter of Zeus, lord of the aegis.    But after they had poured forth and had drunken to their  heart's content, these went each one to his own house to  lie down to rest. But Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots,  would needs have Telemachus, son of divine Odysseus, to  sleep there on a jointed bedstead beneath the echoing  gallery, and by him Peisistratus of the good ashen spear,  leader of men, who alone of his sons was yet unwed in his  halls. As for him he slept within the inmost chamber of the  lofty house, and the lady his wife arrayed for him bedstead  and bedding.    So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,  Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, gat him up from his  bed, and he went forth and sat him down upon the smooth  stones, which were before his lofty doors, all polished,  white and glistening, whereon Neleus sat of old, in counsel  the peer of the gods. Howbeit, stricken by fate, he had ere  now gone down to the house of Hades, and to-day Nestor of  Gerenia in his turn sat thereon, warder of the Achaeans,  with his staff in his hands. And about him his sons were  gathered and come together, issuing from their chambers,  Echephron and Stratius, and Perseus and Aretus and the  godlike Thrasymedes. And sixth and last came the hero  Peisistratus. And they led godlike Telemachus and set him  by their side, and Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots,  spake first among them:    'Quickly, my dear children, accomplish my desire, that  first of all the gods I may propitiate Athene, who came to  me in visible presence to the rich feast of the god. Nay  then, let one go to the plain for a heifer, that she may  come as soon as may be, and that the neat-herd may drive  her: and let another go to the black ship of high-souled  Telemachus to bring all his company, and let him leave two  men only. And let one again bid Laerces the goldsmith to  come hither that he may gild the horns of the heifer. And  ye others, abide ye here together and speak to the  handmaids within that they make ready a banquet through our  famous halls, and fetch seats and logs to set about the  altar, and bring clear water.'    Thus he spake and lo, they all hastened to the work. The  heifer she came from the field, and from the swift gallant  ship came the company of great-hearted Telemachus; the  smith came holding in his hands his tools, the instruments  of his craft, anvil and hammer and well-made pincers,  wherewith he wrought the gold; Athene too came to receive  her sacrifice. And the old knight Nestor gave gold, and the  other fashioned it skilfully, and gilded therewith the  horns of the heifer, that the goddess might be glad at the  sight of her fair offering. And Stratius and goodly  Echephron led the heifer by the horns. And Aretus came  forth from the chamber bearing water for the washing of  hands in a basin of flowered work, and in the other hand he  held the barley-meal in a basket; and Thrasymedes,  steadfast in the battle, stood by holding in his hand a  sharp axe, ready to smite the heifer. And Perseus held the  dish for the blood, and the old man Nestor, driver of  chariots, performed the first rite of the washing of hands  and the sprinkling of the meal, and he prayed instantly to  Athene as he began the rite, casting into the fire the lock  from the head of the victim.    Now when they had prayed and tossed the sprinkled grain,  straightway the son of Nestor, gallant Thrasymedes, stood  by and struck the blow; and the axe severed the tendons of  the neck and loosened the might of the heifer; and the  women raised their cry, the daughters and the sons' wives  and the wife revered of Nestor, Eurydice, eldest of the  daughters of Clymenus. And now they lifted the victim's  head from the wide-wayed earth, and held it so, while  Peisistratus, leader of men, cut the throat. And after the  black blood had gushed forth and the life had left the  bones, quickly they broke up the body, and anon cut slices  from the thighs all duly, and wrapt the same in the fat,  folding them double, and laid raw flesh thereon. So that  old man burnt them on the cleft wood, and poured over them  the red wine, and by his side the young men held in their  hands the five-pronged forks. Now after that the thighs  were quite consumed and they had tasted the inner parts,  they cut the rest up small and spitted and roasted it,  holding the sharp spits in their hands.    Meanwhile she bathed Telemachus, even fair Polycaste, the  youngest daughter of Nestor, son of Neleus. And after she  had bathed him and anointed him with olive oil, and cast  about him a goodly mantle and a doublet, he came forth from  the bath in fashion like the deathless gods. So he went and  sat him down by Nestor, shepherd of the people.    Now when they had roasted the outer flesh, and drawn it off  the spits, they sat down and fell to feasting, and  honourable men waited on them, pouring wine into the golden  cups. But when they had put from them the desire of meat  and drink, Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, first spake  among them:    'Lo now, my sons, yoke for Telemachus horses with flowing  mane and lead them beneath the car, that he may get forward  on his way.'    Even so he spake, and they gave good heed and hearkened;  and quickly they yoked the swift horses beneath the  chariot. And the dame that kept the stores placed therein  corn and wine and dainties, such as princes eat, the  fosterlings of Zeus. So Telemachus stept up into the goodly  car, and with him Peisistratus son of Nestor, leader of  men, likewise climbed the car and grasped the reins in his  hands, and he touched the horses with the whip to start  them, and nothing loth the pair flew towards the plain, and  left the steep citadel of Pylos. So all day long they  swayed the yoke they bore upon their necks.    Now the sun sank and all the ways were darkened. And they  came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Orsilochus,  the child begotten of Alpheus. There they rested for the  night, and by them he set the entertainment of strangers.    Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,  they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car. And forth  they drave from the gateway and the echoing gallery, and  Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start  them, and the pair flew onward nothing loth. So they came  to the wheat-bearing plain, and thenceforth they pressed  toward the end: in such wise did the swift horses speed  forward. Now the sun sank and all the ways were darkened.        Book IV      Telemachus' entertainment at Sparta, where Menelaus tells    him what befell many of the Greeks on their return; that    Odysseus was with Calypso in the isle Ogygia, as he was    told by Proteus.    And they came to Lacedaemon lying low among the caverned  hills, and drave to the dwelling of renowned Menelaus. Him  they found giving a feast in his house to many friends of  his kin, a feast for the wedding of his noble son and  daughter. His daughter he was sending to the son of  Achilles, cleaver of the ranks of men, for in Troy he first  had promised and covenanted to give her, and now the gods  were bringing about their marriage. So now he was speeding  her on her way with chariot and horses, to the famous city  of the Myrmidons, among whom her lord bare rule. And for  his son he was bringing to his home the daughter of Alector  out of Sparta, for his well-beloved son, strong  Megapenthes, {*} born of a slave woman, for the gods no  more showed promise of seed to Helen, from the day that she  bare a lovely child, Hermione, as fair as golden Aphrodite.  So they were feasting through the great vaulted hall, the  neighbours and the kinsmen of renowned Menelaus, making  merry; and among them a divine minstrel was singing to the  lyre, and as he began the song two tumblers in the company  whirled through the midst of them.    {* A son of sorrow: Tristram.}    Meanwhile those twain, the hero Telemachus and the splendid  son of Nestor, made halt at the entry of the gate, they and  their horses.

Indeed, the purely temporary  condition of body and mind is apt to influence the results. A man has  been up late, let us say, or has been for a long walk, or has missed  a meal; obviously his reaction-times, his record for memory, and so  on, will show a difference for the worse. Or, again, the subject may  confront the experiment in very various moods. At one moment he may  be full of vanity, anxious to show what superior qualities he  possesses; whilst at another time he will be bored. Not to labour the  point further, these methods, whatever they may become in the future,  are at present unable to afford any criterion whatever of the mental  ability that goes with race. They are fertile in statistics; but an  interpretation of these statistics that furthers our purpose is still  to seek.    But surely, it will be said, we can tell an instinct when we come across  it, so uniform as it is, and so independent of the rest of the system.  Not at all. For one thing, the idea that an instinct is apiece of  mechanism, as fixed as fate, is quite out of fashion. It is now known  to be highly plastic in many cases, to vary considerably in individuals,  and to involve conscious processes, thought, feeling and will, at any  rate of an elementary kind. Again, how are you going to isolate an  instinct? Those few automatic responses to stimulation that appear  shortly after birth, as, for instance, sucking, may perhaps be  recognized, since parental training and experience in general are out  of the question here. But what about the instinct or group of instincts  answering to sex? This is latent until a stage of life when experience  is already in full swing. Indeed, psychologists are still busy  discussing whether man has very few instincts or whether, on the  contrary, he appears to have few because he really has so many that,  in practice, they keep interfering with one another all the time. In  support of the latter view, it has been recently suggested by Mr.  McDougall that the best test of the instincts that we have is to be  found in the specific emotions. He believes that every instinctive  process consists of an afferent part or message, a central part, and  an efferent part or discharge. At its two ends the process is highly  plastic. Message and discharge, to which thought and will correspond,  are modified in their type as experience matures. The central part,  on the other hand, to which emotion answers on the side of consciousness,  remains for ever much the same. To fear, to wonder, to be angry, or  disgusted, to be puffed up, or cast down, or to be affected with  tenderness--all these feelings, argues Mr. McDougall, and various more  complicated emotions arising out of their combinations with each other,  are common to all men, and bespeak in them deep-seated tendencies to  react on stimulation in relatively particular and definite ways. And  there is much, I think, to be said in favour of this contention.    Yet, granting this, do we thus reach a criterion whereby the different  races of men are to be distinguished? Far from it. Nay, on the contrary,  as judged simply by his emotions, man is very much alike everywhere,  from China to Peru. They are all there in germ, though different customs  and grades of culture tend to bring special types of feeling to the  fore.    Indeed, a certain paradox is to be noted here. The Negro, one would  naturally say, is in general more emotional than the white man. Yet  some experiments conducted by Miss Kellor of Chicago on negresses and  white women, by means of the test of the effects of emotion on  respiration, brought out the former as decidedly the more stolid of  the two. And, whatever be thought of the value of such methods of proof,  certain it is that the observers of rude races incline to put down  most of them as apathetic, when not tuned up to concert-pitch by a  dance or other social event. It may well be, then, that it is not the  hereditary temperament of the Negro, so much as the habit, which he  shares with other peoples at the same level of culture, of living and  acting in a crowd, that accounts for his apparent excitability. But  after all, \"mafficking\" is not unknown in civilized countries. Thus  the quest for a race-mark of a mental kind is barren once more.           *       *       *       *       *    What, then, you exclaim, is the outcome of this chapter of negatives?  Is it driving at the universal equality and brotherhood of man? Or,  on the contrary, does it hint at the need of a stern system of eugenics?  I offer nothing in the way of a practical suggestion. I am merely trying  to show that, considered anthropologically--that is to say, in terms  of pure theory--race or breed remains something which we cannot at  present isolate, though we believe it to be there. Practice, meanwhile,  must wait on theory; mere prejudices, bad as they are, are hardly worse  guides to action than premature exploitations of science.    As regards the universal brotherhood of man, the most that can be said  is this: The old ideas about race as something hard and fast for all  time are distinctly on the decline. Plasticity, or, in other words,  the power of adaptation to environment, has to be admitted to a greater  share in the moulding of mind, and even of body, than ever before.  But how plasticity is related to race we do not yet know. It may be  that use-inheritance somehow incorporates its effects in the offspring  of the plastic parents. Or it may be simply that plasticity increases  with inter-breeding on a wider basis. These problems have still to  be solved.    As regards eugenics, there is no doubt that a vast and persistent  elimination of lives goes on even in civilized countries. It has been  calculated that, of every hundred English born alive, fifty do not  survive to breed, and, of the remainder, half produce three-quarters  of the next generation. But is the elimination selective? We can hardly  doubt that it is to some extent. But what its results are--whether  it mainly favours immunity from certain diseases, or the capacity for  a sedentary life in a town atmosphere, or intelligence and capacity  for social service--is largely matter of guesswork. How, then, can  we say what is the type to breed from, even if we confine our attention  to one country? If, on the other hand, we look farther afield, and  study the results of race-mixture or \"miscegenation,\" we but encounter  fresh puzzles. That the half-breed is an unsatisfactory person may  be true; and yet, until the conditions of his upbringing are somehow  discounted, the race problem remains exactly where it was. Or, again,  it may be true that miscegenation increases human fertility, as some  hold; but, until it is shown that the increase of fertility does not  merely result in flooding the world with inferior types, we are no  nearer to a solution.    If, then, there is a practical moral to this chapter, it is merely  this: to encourage anthropologists to press forward with their study  of race; and in the meantime to do nothing rash.          CHAPTER IV  ENVIRONMENT      When a child is born it has been subjected for some three-quarters  of a year already to the influences of environment. Its race, indeed,  was fixed once for all at the moment of conception. Yet that superadded  measure of plasticity, which has to be treated as something apart from  the racial factor, enables it to respond for good or for evil to the  pre-natal--that is to say, maternal--environment. Thus we may easily  fall into the mistake of supposing our race to be degenerate, when  poor feeding and exposure to unhealthy surroundings on the part of  the mothers are really responsible for the crop of weaklings that we  deplore. And, in so far as it turns out to be so, social reformers  ought to heave a sigh of relief. Why? Because to improve the race by  way of eugenics, though doubtless feasible within limits, remains an  unrealized possibility through our want of knowledge. On the other  hand, to improve the physical environment is fairly straight-ahead  work, once we can awake the public conscience to the need of undertaking  this task for the benefit of all classes of the community alike. If  civilized man wishes to boast of being clearly superior to the rest  of his kind, it must be mainly in respect to his control over the  physical environment. Whatever may have been the case in the past,  it seems as true now-a-days to say that man makes his physical  environment as that his physical environment makes him.    Even if this be granted, however, it remains the fact that our material  circumstances in the widest sense of the term play a very decisive  part in the shaping of our lives. Hence the importance of geographical  studies as they bear on the subject of man. From the moment that a  child is conceived, it is subjected to what it is now the fashion to  call a \"geographic control.\" Take the case of the child of English  parents born in India. Clearly several factors will conspire to  determine whether it lives or dies. For simplicity's sake let us treat  them as three. First of all, there is the fact that the child belongs  to a particular cultural group; in other words, that it has been born  with a piece of paper in its mouth representing one share in the British  Empire. Secondly, there is its race, involving, let us say, blue eyes  and light hair, and a corresponding constitution. Thirdly, there is  the climate and all that goes with it. Though in the first of these  respects the white child is likely to be superior to the native,  inasmuch as it will be tended with more careful regard to the laws  of health; yet such disharmony prevails between the other two factors  of race and climate, that it will almost certainly die, if it is not  removed at a certain age from the country.
