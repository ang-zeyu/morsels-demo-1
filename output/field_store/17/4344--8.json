[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#12)"],[1,"         December,  697.        Dr. Ogle, vol. xlix., 117. _Statistical Society's Journal_.    The influence of temperature is, however, much less powerful on crime  than it is on suicide. It has the effect of raising by one third the  number of persons to whom life becomes an intolerable burden, but  according to the diagram in the Prison Commissioners' Reports the  highest increase in crime between summer and winter does not amount to  more than one twelfth. In other words, between six and eight per cent.  of the crime committed in this country in summer may with reasonable  certainty be attributed to the direct action of temperature. This is  a most important result and I should almost hesitate to state it if  it were supported by my investigations only. But this is far from  being the case. In an important paper contributed to the Revista di  Discipline Carcerarie for 1886, Dr. Marro, one of the most  distinguished students of crime in Italy, has arrived at similar  conclusions. He has shown that in the Italian prisons in the four  hottest months of the Italian summer--May, June, July and  August--there are also the greatest number of offences against prison  discipline. This is a result which coincides in every particular with  what has already been pointed out as holding good in English prisons,  and the attempts of Dr. Colajanni in the second volume of his work,  \"La Sociologia Criminale,\" to explain it away are not by any means  successful. It is hardly possible to conceive a more suitable form of  test for estimating the effect of temperature on human action than the  one afforded by a comparison of the offences committed against prison  regulations at the different seasons of the year. Such a comparison  amply bears out the contention that the seasons are a factor which  must not be overlooked in all enquiries respecting the origin of  crime, and the best methods of dealing with it.    In what way does a rise in temperature act on the individual so as  to make him less capable of resisting the criminal impulse? This is  a question of some difficulty, deserving more attention from  physiologists than it has yet received. It is a satisfactorily  established conclusion that the higher temperature of the summer  months has a debilitating effect on the digestive functions; it is  also believed that these months have an enervating effect on the  system generally. In so far as the heat of summer produces disease, it  at the same time tends to produce crime. Persons suffering from any  kind of ailment or infirmity are far more liable to become criminals  than are healthy members of the community. The intimate connection  between disease and crime is a matter which must never be forgotten.  In the present instance, however, the closeness of this connection is  not sufficient to account for the growth of crime in summer. According  to the Registrar General's report for 1889 the death rate in the  twenty-eight large towns is less in the six months from June to  November than in the six months which follow. There is, therefore,  less disease at the very time when there is most crime. In the face of  this fact it cannot be contended that disease, generally, pushes the  population into criminal courses in summer.    But while this is so, it may yet be true that some special enfeeblement  (generated by the rise of temperature) which does not assume the acute  form usually implied in the name, disease has the effect of  stimulating impulses of a criminal character, or of weakening the  barrier which prevents these impulses from breaking out and carrying  all before them. It is a perfectly well-established fact that a high  temperature not only produces physical enfeeblement, but that it also  impairs the usual activity and energy of the brain. In other words,  a high temperature is invariably accompanied by a certain loss of  mental power. In most persons this loss is comparatively trifling, and  has hardly any perceptible effect on their mode of life and conduct;  in others, it assumes more serious proportions. In some who are  susceptible to cosmical influences, and for one reason or another are  already on the borderland of crime, the decrease of mental function  involved in a rise of temperature becomes a determining factor, and a  criminal act is the result. Through the agency of climate the mental  forces which are normally capable of holding the criminal instincts in  check, lose for a time their accustomed power, and it is whilst this  temporary loss endures that the person subject to it becomes most  liable to be plunged into disaster. It is in this manner, in my  belief, that temperature deleteriously operates upon human conduct.    The results of my investigations do not, however, bear out the  commonly accepted view that crimes against property increase in the  depth of winter. As far as this law relates to crime in France it may  be correct; the statistical inquiries of Guerry, Ferri, and Corre  point to that conclusion. On the other hand, as far as the law relates  to England, I have serious doubts as to its validity. In the county of  Surrey, in the year 1888-89, not only more crimes against the person,  but also more crimes against property were committed in July than in  January. In the former month, as compared with the latter, cases of  felony increased 20 per cent.; and if Surrey is to be taken as a fairly  typical English county--which there is every reason to believe it  is--we have before us the remarkable fact that there are more offences  against property in summer than in winter. The current opinion that  winter is the most criminal period of the year is entirely fallacious,  and it is extremely probable that it is equally fallacious to imagine  that property is less sate when the days are short and the nights  long.    But while property, on the whole, in more safe in winter than in  summer, the offences committed against it in winter are, as a rule, of  a more serious character. This, at least, is the conclusion which I  should be inclined to draw, from the fact that there are more  indictable offences--that is to say, offences not tried by a  magistrate, but by a judge and jury--in the six months between October  and March than in the summer six months. For the year ended September,  1888, which is an average year, there were fully 2000 more indictable  offences in the winter six months than in the summer six months. As a  considerable proportion of indictable offences consist in crimes  against property of the nature of housebreaking and burglary, it is  very probable that these crimes are most prevalent in winter. But if  all kinds of offences against property, petty as well as grave, are  thrown together, and calculated under one head, it comes out that  these offences are most numerous in summer.    The only kind of crime that increases in Surrey in winter is vagrancy;  the growth of this offence for the years I have mentioned in January,  as contrasted with July was 60 per cent. The development of vagrancy  in the cold months is partly owing to the fact that work is not so  easily procured in the cold weather; and a certain percentage of the  population, mainly dependent for subsistence on casual and irregular  out-door jobs, will rather resort to begging than the workhouse, when  this kind of occupation is temporarily at a standstill. This class,  however, is a comparatively small one, and constitutes a very feeble  proportion of the offenders against the Vagrancy Acts which swell the  prison statistics in winter. Most of the offenders against these acts  are people who seize the opportunity afforded by the bitter weather of  appealing to the sympathies of the public. In summer the occupation of  such persons is to some extent gone; in the hot sunshine their rags  and piteous looks do not so strongly affect our feelings of  commiseration; we know they are not suffering from cold; their  petitions and entreaties accordingly fall upon deaf ears; in short,  begging is not a paying trade in the hot months. In winter, all these  conditions are reversed; with the first fall of snow off go the  vagrant's boots, and out he runs looking the picture of misery and  destitution. In an hour or two, if he escapes the attentions of the  police, he has made as much as will keep him comfortably for a few  days; but like many better men his success often brings about his  fall; the alms of a generous public are consumed in the nearest  beer-shop; sallying forth in quest of fresh booty, and made bold and  insolent with drink, the beggar soon finds himself in the hands of the  authorities. Anyone who cares to verify this statement can easily do  so by following the reports of the police courts, and taking note of  the number of convictions for _drunkenness and begging_--a somewhat  significant combination of offences, and one which ought to make the  inconsiderate giver pause.    What are the practical conclusions to be deduced from this study of  the relations between temperature and crime? The first and most  obvious conclusion is, that any considerable rise of temperature has a  tendency, as far as Europeans and their descendants are concerned, to  diminish human responsibility. Whether there are any palliatives  against this tendency in the way of regimen, and what they are, is a  matter for the consideration of physiologists; and a most important  matter it is, for a high temperature does not merely lead to offences  against the law, it also injuriously affects the conduct of children  in schools, of soldiers in the army, of workmen in factories, and of  the public generally in their relations with one another. While it is  the task of physiologists to examine the physical aspects of the  anti-social tendencies developed by variations of temperature, it is  the duty of all persons placed in positions of authority to recognise  their existence; and to recognise their existence not merely in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15831"],[0,"The Scientific American Boy; Or, The Camp at Willow Clump Island (#12)"],[1," provided a rustic railing for the bridge  of light poles nailed to the king posts and the diagonal spars.          CHAPTER X.    CANVAS CANOES.      Like all inhabitants of islands, we early turned our attention to  navigation. Our scow was serviceable for transporting materials back and  forth across the strips of shallow water between our quarters and the  Jersey shore. We never attempted to row across, because progress would  have been entirely too slow, and we would have drifted down to the  rapids long ere we could reach the opposite side. But on Lake Placid  matters were different. Although there was no settlement near us on the  Pennsylvania shore, to occasion our crossing the water for provisions  and the like, yet the quiet stretch was admirably suited to boating for  pleasure, and mighty little pleasure could we get out of our heavy scow.      UNCLE ED'S DEPARTURE.    Owing to a sudden business call Uncle Ed left us after he had been with  us nearly three weeks. But, before going, he explained carefully to Bill  just how to construct a canvas canoe. Jack, the cook, who was anxious to  lay in a second supply of provisions, accompanied Uncle Ed as far as  Millville, the next town below Lamington. Here Uncle Ed bought five  yards of canvas, 42 inches wide, several cans of paint and a quantity of  brass and copper nails and tacks. These supplies, together with the food  provisions that Jack had collected, were brought to us late in the  afternoon by Mr. Schreiner. Mr. Schreiner also brought the necessary  boards and strips of wood for the framework of our canoe.      A VISIT FROM MR. SCHREINER.    We invited Mr. Schreiner to spend the night with us, and this he did  after fording with some difficulty the swift-running river. In the  morning we showed him our quarters, our filter, the roads we had built,  the spar bridge across to Kite Island, our surveying instrument and the  chart we had made of the vicinity. He was greatly pleased with our work,  and it was then that he gave us an order for the bridge over the gorge.  From that day on he became our staunchest ally, so that when my father  and Mr. Van Syckel complained that we were loafing away a lot of time  which could be more profitably spent in study or work, Mr. Schreiner  stood up for us and declared that our experiences on the island were  doing us far more good, both physically and mentally, than any other  work that they could conceive of; that before condemning us they should  pay us a visit and see how we were employing our time.      THE SAILING CANOE.    [Illustration: Exploring the River in the Indian Canoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 104. Stern Post of the Canoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 105. Stern of the Canoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 106. Center Form.]    [Illustration: Fig. 107. Bulkheads.]    [Illustration: Fig. 108. Center Braces.]    [Illustration: Fig. 109. Top View of the Canoe Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 110. Side View of the Canoe Frame.]    Immediately after Mr. Schreiner's departure we started work on the  canoe. A strip of spruce 1 inch thick, 3 inches wide and 12 feet long  served as the keelson. At the stern a post 1-1/2 inches thick, 3 inches  wide and 13 inches high was secured to the keelson with brass screws.  This was braced as indicated in Fig. 104. At the bow a stem piece was  attached to the keelson. This stem was cut to a somewhat semicircular  form, as shown in Fig. 105. The outer edge was tapered with a draw-knife  to a thickness of 1/4 inch and a brace was nailed to the inner edge. Our  next work was to cut out three forms, one of the shape shown in Fig. 106  and two like that shown in Fig. 107. The first form was set up on the  keelson midway between the stem and stern, and the other two were spaced  about four feet each side of the center form. The center form was used  only for shaping the frame of the boat, and was not intended to be  permanently affixed to the canoe. Therefore, we fastened it to the  keelson very lightly, so that it could be readily removed. The other two  forms, however, were made permanent parts of the frame, serving as  bulkheads. The gunwales were now secured in position. These were of  spruce 3/4 inch thick and 2 inches wide. The ends were beveled off so as  to neatly fit the stem piece and the stern post, to which they were  fastened by brass screws. Then we applied the longitudinal strips, or  rib bands, which were of 1/4-inch thick spruce 1 inch wide. Ten of these  bands were used, equally spaced apart on the center form, to which they  were lightly tacked; but they were nailed securely to the bulkheads and  the stem piece and stern post. The cross ribs were made of barrel hoops  which we had soaked in water for a day or so to render them pliable  enough to be bent into place. These hoops were split to a width of 1/2  inch, and secured first to the keelson, then to the longitudinal strips  and finally to the gunwales. Copper tacks were used for nailing the ribs  in place, and these were long enough to be passed through the rib bands  and clinched on the outside. Forty cross ribs were nailed on, and at the  center of the canoe they were spaced about three inches apart. The  center form was then removed and cut along the dotted lines shown in  Fig. 106. The semicircular pieces thus obtained were now strengthened  with strips on their inner edges, and wedged in between the keelson and  the gunwales, to which they were nailed, as shown in Fig. 108. A pair of  cleats nailed to the cross ribs served as supports for the seat of the  canoe. The frame of the boat was completed by nailing in place two deck  beams of 1/2-inch square pine and four corner pieces between the  gunwales and the bulkheads, so as to make an elliptical well hole or  deck opening. Before laying on the canvas covering the edges of the  gunwales, keelson, deck beams, stem and stern posts were smoothed down  with sandpaper.    [Illustration: Fig. 111. Lacing the Canvas on the Frame.]      STRETCHING ON THE CANVAS.    [Illustration: Fig. 112. Tacking the Canvas to the Keel.]    The frame was laid in the center of the canvas and the latter drawn  around it. Then with a large needle and strong twine we sewed both edges  of the cloth together with long stitches, lacing the canvas over the  frame as a shoe is laced over a foot. This done, the boat was turned  deck downward and the canvas was tacked to the keelson. In each case,  before driving in a tack a daub of white lead was applied, to  water-proof the spot. At the stem and stern a gore (narrow triangular  piece) was cut out of the canvas so as to make it lie smooth on the  frame, and white lead was painted in between the overlapping edges. The  canoe was then turned deck upward and the lacing tightened, while we  carefully worked out all wrinkles in the cloth. After tacking the canvas  along the gunwales on the outside, it was trimmed off, leaving  sufficient margin to be brought over the gunwales and tacked inside. Two  triangular pieces were cut out for the decks, and these were lapped over  the outer canvas and tacked to the gunwales. A narrow molding along the  edge of the boat served to cover the tack heads and added a certain  finish to the canoe. A keel plate 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick was  attached to the outside of the boat, and then, after wetting the canvas,  it was given a coat of white lead and oil. When this was perfectly dry  it was sandpapered and the second coat applied.      THE RUDDER.    [Illustration: Fig. 113. The Rudder.]    [Illustration: Fig. 114. The Rudder Hinge.]    The canoe was now complete except for the rudder, which was cut from a  1/2-inch board to about the shape shown in Fig. 114. Strips 1-1/2 inches  wide and 1/2 inch thick were nailed to each side of the blade, forming a  post, to the top of which a crosspiece or tiller was fastened. A cleat  nailed to the pillar at each side of the rudder post served to greatly  strengthen the joint. The rudder was hinged to the canoe by a rod, which  passed through four brass screw eyes, two threaded into the rudder and a  corresponding pair screwed into the stern. For convenience in steering  we ran our tiller rope clear around the boat, through screw eyes in the  gunwales and a pulley at the stem, so that the steersman could guide his  craft from any point in the canoe.      THE DEEP KEEL.    [Illustration: Fig. 115. Bottom of Canoe, Showing Deep Keel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 116. End View, Showing Deep Keel.]    We planned to use our canoe as a sailboat, and had to provide a deep  keel, which, for convenience, was made detachable. This keel was 6  inches wide, 1/2 inch thick and 6 feet long, and was fastened at the  center of the canoe. Screw eyes about twelve inches apart were threaded  alternately into opposite sides of the keel plate. Corresponding hooks  were attached to the keel in position to hook into the screw eyes, and  thus hold the keel firmly in place.      CANOE SAILS.    [Illustration: Fig. 117. The Mast Step.]    [Illustration: Fig. 118. The Mainsail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 119. The Mizzen Sail.]    Our boat was fitted with two masts, a mainmast and a mizzen or dandy  mast. The former was 6 feet long and the latter 4 feet long, and each  measured 1-1/2 inches in diameter at the base, tapering to about 1 inch  diameter at the upper end. They were held in brass bands, or clamps,  bent around them and secured to the bulkheads, as shown in Fig. 117. The  sails were of the lanteen type. The mainsail measured 8-1/2 feet along  the boom, 9-1/2 feet along the yard and 10 feet at the leach. The  dimensions of the mizzen sail were: along the boom, 5 feet; along the  yard, 5-1/2 feet; and at the leach, 6 feet. The boom was attached to a  strap of leather on the mast, and was thus given freedom to swing around  in any desired position. The yard was similarly attached, and was raised  by a cord, which passed through pulleys at the top and at the base of  the mast and extended to a cleat"]]]
