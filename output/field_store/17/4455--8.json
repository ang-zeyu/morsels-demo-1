[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#12)"],[1,"you have listened  to my too extended remarks, I submit the legal questions which the case  involves for your honor's consideration.           *       *       *    THE COURT addressed the jury as follows:    _Gentlemen of the Jury_:    I have given this case such consideration as I have been able to, and,  that there might be no misapprehension about my views, I have made a  brief statement in writing.    The defendant is indicted under the act of Congress of 1870, for having  voted for Representatives in Congress in November, 1872. Among other  things, that Act makes it an offence for any person knowingly to vote  for such Representatives without having a right to vote. It is charged  that the defendant thus voted, she not having a right to vote because  she is a woman. The defendant insists that she has a right to vote; that  the provision of the Constitution of this State limiting the right to  vote to persons of the male sex is in violation of the 14th Amendment of  the Constitution of the United States, and is void. The 13th, 14th and  15th Amendments were designed mainly for the protection of the newly  emancipated negroes, but full effect must nevertheless be given to the  language employed. The 13th Amendment provided that neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude should longer exist in the United States. If  honestly received and fairly applied, this provision would have been  enough to guard the rights of the colored race. In some States it was  attempted to be evaded by enactments cruel and oppressive in their  nature, as that colored persons were forbidden to appear in the towns  except in a menial capacity; that they should reside on and cultivate  the soil without being allowed to own it; that they were not permitted  to give testimony in cases where a white man was a party. They were  excluded from performing particular kinds of business, profitable and  reputable, and they were denied the right of suffrage. To meet the  difficulties arising from this state of things, the 14th and 15th  Amendments were enacted.    The 14th Amendment created and defined citizenship of the United States.  It had long been contended, and had been held by many learned  authorities, and had never been judicially decided to the contrary, that  there was no such thing as a citizen of the United States, except as  that condition arose from citizenship of some State. No mode existed, it  was said, of obtaining a citizenship of the United States except by  first becoming a citizen of some State. This question is now at rest.  The 14th Amendment defines and declares who should be citizens of the  United States, to wit: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United  States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" The latter  qualification was intended to exclude the children of foreign  representatives and the like. With this qualification every person born  in the United States or naturalized is declared to be a citizen of the  United States, and of the State wherein he resides. After creating and  defining citizenship of the United States, the Amendment provides that  no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the  privileges or immunities of a citizen of the United States. This clause  is intended to be a protection, not to all our rights, but to our rights  as citizens of the United States only; that is, the rights existing or  belonging to that condition or capacity. The words \"or citizen of a  State,\" used in the previous paragraph are carefully omitted here. In  article 4, paragraph 2, of the Constitution of the United States it had  been already provided in this language, viz: \"the citizens of each State  shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens  in the several States.\" The rights of citizens of the States and of  citizens of the United States are each guarded by these different  provisions. That these rights were separate and distinct, was held in  the Slaughter House Cases recently decided by the United States Supreme  Court at Washington. The rights of citizens of the State, as such, are  not under consideration in the 14th Amendment. They stand as they did  before the adoption of the 14th Amendment, and are fully guaranteed by  other provisions. The rights of citizens of the States have been the  subject of judicial decision on more than one occasion. _Corfield agt.  Coryell, 4 Wash.; C.C.R., 371. Ward agt. Maryland; 12 Wall., 430. Paul  agt. Virginia, 8 Wall., 140._    These are the fundamental privileges and immunities belonging of right  to the citizens of all free governments, such as the right of life and  liberty; the right to acquire and possess property, to transact  business, to pursue happiness in his own manner, subject to such  restraint as the Government may adjudge to be necessary for the general  good. In _Cromwell agt. Nevada, 6 Wallace, 36_, is found a statement of  some of the rights of a citizen of the United States, viz: \"To come to  the seat of the Government to assert any claim he may have upon the  Government, to transact any business he may have with it; to seek its  protection; to share its offices; to engage in administering its  functions. He has the right of free access to its seaports through which  all operations of foreign commerce are conducted, to the sub-treasuries,  land offices, and courts of justice in the several States.\" Another  privilege of a citizen of the United States, says Miller, Justice, in  the \"Slaughter House\" cases, is to demand the care and protection of the  Federal Government over his life, liberty and property when on the high  seas or within the jurisdiction of a foreign government. The right to  assemble and petition for a redress of grievances, the privilege of the  writ of _habeas corpus_, he says, are rights of the citizen guaranteed  by the Federal Constitution.    The right of voting, or the privilege of voting, is a right or privilege  arising under the Constitution of the State, and not of the United  States. The qualifications are different in the different States.  Citizenship, age, sex, residence, are variously required in the  different States, or may be so. If the right belongs to any particular  person, it is because such person is entitled to it by the laws of the  State where he offers to exercise it, and not because of citizenship of  the United States. If the State of New York should provide that no  person should vote until he had reached the age of 31 years, or after he  had reached the age of 50, or that no person having gray hair, or who  had not the use of all his limbs, should be entitled to vote, I do not  see how it could be held to be a violation of any right derived or held  under the Constitution of the United States. We might say that such  regulations were unjust, tyrannical, unfit for the regulation of an  intelligent State; but if rights of a citizen are thereby violated, they  are of that fundamental class derived from his position as a citizen of  the State, and not those limited rights belonging to him as a citizen of  the United States, and such was the decision in _Corfield agt. Coryell_.  (Supra.) The United States rights appertaining to this subject are those  first under article I, paragraph 2, of the United States Constitution,  which provides that electors of Representatives in Congress shall have  the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of  the State Legislature, and second, under the 15th Amendment, which  provides that the right of a citizen of the United States to vote shall  not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on  account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. If the  Legislature of the State of New York should require a higher  qualification in a voter for a representative in Congress than is  required for a voter for a Member of Assembly, this would, I conceive,  be a violation of a right belonging to one as a citizen of the United  States. That right is in relation to a Federal subject or interest, and  is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. The inability of a State to  abridge the right of voting on account of race, color, or previous  condition of servitude, arises from a Federal guaranty. Its violation  would be the denial of a Federal right--that is a right belonging to the  claimant as a citizen of the United States.    This right, however, exists by virtue of the 15th Amendment. If the 15th  Amendment had contained the word \"sex,\" the argument of the defendant  would have been potent. She would have said, an attempt by a State to  deny the right to vote because one is of a particular sex, is expressly  prohibited by that Amendment. The amendment, however, does not contain  that word. It is limited to race, color, or previous condition of  servitude. The Legislature of the State of New York has seen fit to say,  that the franchise of voting shall be limited to the male sex. In saying  this, there is, in my judgment, no violation of the letter or of the  spirit of the 14th or of the 15th Amendment. This view is assumed in the  second section of the 14th Amendment, which enacts that if the right to  vote for Federal officers is denied by any state to any of the male  inhabitants of such State, except for crime, the basis of representation  of such State shall be reduced in proportion specified. Not only does  this section assume that the right of male inhabitants to vote was the  especial object of its protection, but it assumes and admits the right  of a State, notwithstanding the existence of that clause under which the  defendant claims to the contrary, to deny to classes or portions of the  male inhabitants the right to vote which is allowed to other male  inhabitants. The regulation of the suffrage is thereby conceded to the  States as a State's right. The case of Myra Bradwell, decided at a  recent term of the Supreme Court of the United States, sustains both the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#12)"],[1,"was the life of his playing.\" A  union of conception and technique was a high aim of Beethoven, and he  prized the latter only as it fulfilled the requirements of his idealism.  \"The high development of the mechanical in pianoforte playing,\" he wrote  to a friend, \"will end in banishing all genuine emotion from music.\"  His prophetic words might serve as a warning to-day.    [Illustration: LILLIAN NORDICA]    The past century has given us the golden age of the pianoforte. Advanced  knowledge of acoustics and improved methods of construction have made it  the magnificent instrument we know in concert hall and home, and to  which we now apply the more intimate name, piano. Oscar Bie calls it the  music teacher of all mankind that has become great with the growth of  modern music. As a photograph may convey to the home an excellent  conception of a master painting in some distant art gallery, so the  piano, in addition to the musical creations it has inspired, may present  to the domestic circle intelligent reproductions of mighty choral,  operatic and instrumental works. Through its medium the broad field of  musical history and literature may be surveyed in private with profit  and pleasure.    Piano composers and virtuosos rapidly increase. Carl Maria von Weber  (1786-1826) stood on the threshold of the fairyland of romance. His  scheme of a dialogue, in the opening adagio of his \"Invitation to the  Dance,\" followed by an entrancing waltz and a grave concluding dialogue,  betokens what he might have accomplished for the piano had he lived  longer. Franz Schubert (1797-1828) and Robert Schumann (1810-1856) were  the evangelists par excellence of the new romantic school. Schubert,  closely allied in spirit to the master-builder, Beethoven, was  unsurpassed in the refinement of his musical sentiment. The melody  flooding his soul beautified his piano compositions, to which only a  delicate touch may do justice. His Impromptus and Moments Musical, small  impressionist pieces, in which isolated musical ideas are clothed in  brief artistic forms adapted to the timbre of the instrument, may well  be thought to have placed piano literature on a new basis.    The romantic temperament of Robert Schumann was nurtured on German  romantic literature and music. His impressions of nature, life and  literature he imprisoned in tones. He was a profound student of Bach, to  whom he traced \"the power of combination, poetry and humor in the new  music.\" Infusing his own vital emotions into polyphonic forms he gave  the piano far grander tone-pictures than those of Couperin. The dreamy  fervor and the glowing fire of an impassioned nature may be felt in his  works, but also many times the lack of balance that belongs with the  malady by which he was assailed.    His love of music became early interwoven with love for Clara, the  gifted daughter and pupil of his teacher, Friedrich Wieck. To her he  dedicated his creative power. An attempt to gain flexibility by means of  a mechanical contrivance having lamed his fingers, he turned from a  pianist's career to composition and musical criticism. In becoming his  wife Clara gave him both hands in more senses than one, and they shone  together as a double star in the art firmament. Madame Schumann had  acquired a splendid foundation for her career through the wise guidance  of her father, whose pedagogic ideas every piano student might consider  with profit. Her playing was distinguished by its musicianly  intelligence and fine artistic feeling. Earnest simplicity surrounded  her public and her private life, and the element of personal display was  wholly foreign to her. She was the ideal woman, artist and teacher who  remained in active service until a short time before her death, in 1896.    Those were charmed days in Leipsic when the Schumanns and Mendelssohn  formed the centre of an enthusiastic circle of musicians, and created a  far-reaching musical atmosphere. Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847), in his  work for the piano, adapted to drawing-room use technical devices of his  day, and in his \"Songs without Words\" gave a decisive short-story form  to piano literature. His playing is described as possessing an organ  firmness of touch without organ ponderosity, and having an expression  that moved deeply without intoxicating. Living in genial surroundings,  he was never forced to struggle, and although he climbed through flowery  paths, he never reached the goal he longed for until his heart broke.    Delicate, sensitive, fastidious, Frederic Chopin (1809-1849) delivered  his musical message with persuasive eloquence through the medium of the  piano. It was his chosen comrade. With it he exchanged the most subtle  confidences. Gaining a profound knowledge of its resources he raised it  to an independent power. Polish patriotism steeped in Parisian elegance  shaped his genius, and his compositions portray the emotions of his  people in exquisitely polished tonal language. Spontaneous as was his  creative power he was most painstaking in regard to the setting of his  musical ideas and would often devote weeks to re-writing a single page  that every detail might be perfect. The best that was in him he gave to  music and to the piano. He enlarged the musical vocabulary, he  re-created and enriched technique and diction, and to him the musician  of to-day owes a debt that should never be forgotten. \"He is of the race  of eagles,\" said his teacher, Elsner. \"Let all who aspire follow him in  his flights toward regions sublime.\"    The man who, by his demands on the piano, induced improvements in its  manufacture that materially increased its sonority and made it  available for the modern idea, was Franz Liszt (1811-1886). He will  always be remembered as the creator of orchestral piano-playing and of  the symphonic poem. The impetuous rhythms and unfathomable mysteries of  Magyar and gipsy life surrounding him in Hungary, the land of his birth,  strongly influenced the shaping of his genius. Like the wandering  children of nature who had filled the dreams of his childhood, he became  a wanderer and marched a conqueror, radiant with triumphs, through the  musical world. Chopin, who shrank from concert-playing, once said to  him: \"You are destined for it. You have the force to overwhelm, control,  compel the public.\"    The bewitching tones of the gipsy violinist, Bihary, had fallen on his  boyish ears \"like drops of some fiery, volatile essence,\" stimulating  him to effort. On the threshold of manhood he was inspired to apply the  methods of Paganini to the piano. All his early realistic and  revolutionary ideas found vent in his pianistic achievements. He gained  marvelous fulness of chord power, great dynamic variety, and numerous  unexpected solutions of the tone problem. Many technical means of  expression were invented by him, and a wholly new fingering was required  for his purposes. He taught the use of a loose wrist, absolute  independence of the fingers and a new manipulation of the pedals. To  carry out his designs the third or sustaining pedal became necessary.  His highest ambition, in his own words, was \"to leave to piano players  the foot-prints of attained advance.\" In 1839 he ventured on the first  pure piano recital ever given in the concert hall. His series of  performances in this line, covering the entire range of piano  literature, in addition to his own compositions, given entirely without  notes, led the public to expect playing by heart from all other artists.    As a great pianist, a composer of original conceptions, a magnetic  conductor, an influential teacher, an intelligent writer on musical  subjects and a devoted promoter of the interests of art, he stands out  in bold relief, one of the grand figures in the history of music. His  piano paraphrases and transcriptions are poetic re-settings of  tone-creations he had thoroughly assimilated and made his own. In his  original works, which Saint-Saens was perhaps the first to appreciate,  students are now beginning to discover the ripe fruits of his genius.  Faithful ones among the pupils who flocked about him in classic Weimar  spread wide his influence, but also much harm was done in his name by  charlatans who, calling themselves Liszt pupils, cast broadcast the  fallacy that piano pounding was genuine pianistic power.    Large hearted, liberal minded, whole souled in his devotion to his art  and its true interests, Franz Liszt seemed wholly without personal  jealousies, and befriended and brought into public notice a large number  of artists. Hector Berlioz declared that to him belonged \"the sincere  admiration of earnest minds, as well as the involuntary homage of the  envious.\" At the opening of the Baireuth Temple of German Art, in 1876,  Richard Wagner paid him this tribute in the midst of a joyful company:  \"Here is one who first gave me faith in my work when no one knew  anything of me. But for him, my dear friend, Franz Liszt, you might not  have had a note from me to-day.\"    A rival of Liszt in the concert field, especially before a Parisian  public, was Sigismund Thalberg (1812-1871), who visited this country in  1855 and literally popularized the piano in America. Alfred Jaell and  Henri Herz, who had preceded him, doubtless prepared the way for his  triumphs. He and the \"Creole Chopin,\" Louis Moreau Gottschalk, attracted  much attention by several joint appearances in our musical centres of  the time. Thalberg was a pupil of Hummel, and felt the influence of his  teacher's cold, severely classic style. He possessed a well-trained,  fascinating mechanism, with scales, chords, arpeggios and octaves that  were marvels of neatness and accuracy, and a tone that was mellow and  liquid, though lacking in warmth. His operatic transcriptions, in which  a central melody is enfolded in arabesques, chords and running passages,  have long since become antiquated, but his art of singing on the piano  and many"]]]
