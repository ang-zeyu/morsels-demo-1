Didn't want to run it into the cut until you  passed on it.\"    Bart looked first at Bud, and he looked hard. Then he rode over and  inspected the yearling, Dirk close at his heels.    \"Throw 'er back with the bunch,\" He ordered.    \"That finishes the cut, then,\" Bud announced, rubbing his hand along  Stopper's sweaty neck. \"I kept passing this critter up, and I guess the  other boys did the same. But it's the last one, and I thought I'd run  her out for you to look over.\"    Bart grunted. \"Dirk, you take a look and see if they've got 'em all. And  you, Kid, can help haze the cut up the Flat--the boys'll show you what  to do.\"    Bud, remembering Smoky and Sunfish and his camp, hesitated. \"I've got  a camp down here by the creek,\" He said. \"If it's all the same to you,  I'll report for work in the morning, if you'll tell me where to head  for. And I'll have to arrange somehow to pasture my horses; I've got a  couple more at camp.\"    Bart studied him for a minute, and Bud thought he was going to change  his mind about the job, or the sixty dollars a month. But Bart merely  told him to ride on up the Flat next morning, and take the first trail  that turned to the left. \"The Muleshoe ranch is up there agin that pine  mountain,\" he explained. \"Bring along your outfit. I guess we can take  care of a couple of horses, all right.\"    That suited Bud very well, and he rode away thinking how lucky he was to  have taken the right fork in the road, that day. He had ridden straight  into a job, and while he was not very enthusiastic over the boss, the  other boys seemed all right, and the wages were a third more than he  had expected to get just at first. It was the first time, he reminded  himself, that he had been really tempted to locate, and he certainly had  struck it lucky.    He did not know that when he left the roundup his going had been  carefully noted, and that he was no sooner out of sight than Dirk Tracy  was riding cautiously on his trail. While he fed his horses the last bit  of grain he had, and cooked his supper over what promised to be his last  camp-fire, he did not dream that the man with the droopy mustache was  lying amongst the bushes on the other bank of the creek, watching every  move he made.    He meant to be up before daylight so that he could strike the ranch  of the Muleshoe outfit in time for breakfast, wherefore he went to bed  before the afterglow had left the mountain-tops around him. And being  young and carefree and healthfully weary, he was asleep and snoring  gently within five minutes of his last wriggle into his blankets. But  Dirk Tracy watched him for fully two hours before he decided that the  kid was not artfully pretending, but was really asleep and likely to  remain so for the night.    Dirk was an extremely cautious man, but he was also tired, and the cold  food he had eaten in place of a hot supper had not been satisfying to  his stomach. He crawled carefully out of the brush, stole up the creek  to where he had left his horse, and rode away.    He was not altogether sure that he had done his full duty to the  Muleshoe, but it was against human nature for a man nearing forty to  lie uncovered in the brush, and let a numerous family of mosquitoes feed  upon him while he listened to a young man snoring comfortably in a good  camp bed a hundred feet away.    Dirk, because his conscience was not quite clear, slept in the stable  that night and told his boss a lie next morning.        CHAPTER EIGHT: THE MULESHOE    The riders of the Muleshoe outfit were eating breakfast when Bud rode  past the long, low-roofed log cabin to the corral which stood nearest  the clutter of stables and sheds. He stopped there and waited to see if  his new boss was anywhere in sight and would come to tell him where to  unpack his belongings. A sandy complexioned young man with red eyelids  and no lashes presently emerged from the stable and came toward him,  his mouth sagging loosely open, his eye; vacuous. He was clad in faded  overalls turned up a foot at the bottom and showing frayed, shoddy  trousers beneath and rusty, run-down shoes that proved he was not a  rider. His hat was peppered with little holes, as if someone had fired a  charge of birdshot at him and had all but bagged him.    The youth's eyes became fixed upon the guitar and mandolin cases roped  on top of Sunfish's pack, and he pointed and gobbled something which had  the sound speech without being intelligible. Bud cocked an ear toward  him inquiringly, made nothing of the jumble and rode off to the cabin,  leading Sunfish after him. The fellow might or might not be the idiot he  looked, and he might or might not keep his hands off the pack. Bud was  not going to take any chance.    He heard sounds within the cabin, but no one appeared until he shouted,  \"Hello!\" twice. The door opened then and Bart Nelson put out his head,  his jaws working over a mouthful of food that seemed tough.    \"Oh, it's you. C'm awn in an' eat,\" he invited, and Bud dismounted,  never guessing that his slightest motion had been carefully observed  from the time he had forded the creek at the foot of the slope beyond  the cabin.    Bart introduced him to the men by the simple method of waving his hand  at the group around the table and saying, \"Guess you know the boys.  What'd yuh say we could call yuh?\"    \"Bud--ah--Birnie,\" Bud answered, swiftly weighing the romantic idea of  using some makeshift name until he had made his fortune, and deciding  against it. A false name might mean future embarrassment, and he was so  far from home that his father would never hear of him anyway. But his  hesitation served to convince every man there that Birnie was not his  name, and that he probably had good cause for concealing his own. Adding  that to Dirk Tracy's guess that he was from Jackson's Hole, the sum  spelled outlaw.    The Muleshoe boys were careful not to seem curious about Bud's past.  They even refrained from manifesting too much interest in the musical  instruments until Bud himself took them out of their cases that evening  and began tuning them. Then the half-baked, tongue-tied fellow came over  and gobbled at him eagerly.    \"Hen wants yuh to play something,\" a man they called Day interpreted.  \"Hen's loco on music. If you can sing and play both, Hen'll set and  listen till plumb daylight and never move an eyewinker.\"    Bud looked up, smiled a little because Hen had no eyewinkers to move,  and suddenly felt pity because a man could be so altogether unlikeable  as Hen. Also because his mother's face stood vividly before him for  an instant, leaving him with a queer tightening of the throat and  the feeling that he had been rebuked. He nodded to Hen, laid down the  mandolin and picked up the guitar, turned up the a string a bit, laid  a booted and spurred foot across the other knee, plucked a minor chord  sonorously and began abruptly:    \"Yo' kin talk about you coons a-havin' trouble--Well, Ah think Ah have  enough-a of mah oh-own--\"    Hen's high-pointed Adam's apple slipped up and down in one great gulp of  ecstasy. He eased slowly down upon the edge of the bunk beside Bud and  gazed at him fascinatedly, his lashless eyes never winking, his jaw  dropped so that his mouth hung half open. Day nudged Dirk Tracy, who  parted his droopy mustache and smiled his unlovely smile, lowering his  left eyelid unnecessarily at Bud. The dimple in Bud's chin wrinkled as  he bent his head and plunked the interlude with a swing that set spurred  boots tapping the floor rhythmically.    \"Bart, he's went and hired a show-actor, looks like.\" Dirk confided  behind his hand to Shorty McGuire. \"That's real singin', if yuh ask me!\"    \"Shut up!\" grunted Shorty, and prodded Dirk into silence so that he  would miss none of the song.    Since Buddy had left the pink-apron stage of his adventurous life behind  him, singing songs to please other people had been as much a part of his  life as riding and roping and eating and sleeping. He had always sung or  played or danced when he was asked to do so--accepting without question  his mother's doctrine that it was unkind and ill-bred to refuse when he  really could do those things well, because on the cattle ranges indoor  amusements were few, and those who could furnish real entertainment were  fewer. Even at the University, coon songs and Irish songs and love songs  had been his portion; wherefore his repertoire seemed endless, and if  folks insisted upon it he could sing from dark to dawn, providing his  voice held out.    Hen sat with his big-jointed hands hanging loosely over his knees and  listened, stared at Bud and grinned vacuously when one song was done,  gulped his Adam's apple and listened again as raptly to the next one.  The others forgot all about having fun watching Hen, and named old  favorites and new ones, heard them sung inimitably and called for more.  At midnight Bud blew on his blistered fingertips and shook the guitar  gently, bottom-side up.    \"I guess that's all the music there is in the darned thing to-night,\" he  lamented. \"She's made to keep time, and she always strikes, along about  midnight.\"    \"Huh-huh!\" chortled Hen convulsively, as if he understood the joke. He  closed his mouth and sighed deeply, as one who has just wakened from a  trance.    After that, Hen followed Bud around like a pet dog, and found time  between stable chores to groom those astonished horses, Stopper and  Smoky and Sunfish, as if they were stall-kept thoroughbreds. He had them  coming up to the pasture gate every day for the few handfuls of grain he  purloined for them, and their sleekness was a joy to behold.    \"Hen, he's adopted yuh, horses and all, looks like,\" Dirk observed one  day to Bud when they were riding together. And he tempered the statement  by adding that Hen was trusty enough, even if he didn't have as much  sense as the law"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#12)"],[1,"by the pines, he uttered his first prayer to  God. For a full hour he prayed and wept, until a peaceful spirit  overpowered him, and he slept.    Rupert awoke with a changed heart, though he was weak and faint. Evening  was coming on and he saw the smoke curling from the chimney of a  farmhouse half a mile below. Painfully, he made his way down to it.    A young man was feeding the cows for the night, and Rupert went up to  him, and said:    \"Good evening, sir; have you any objection to my sleeping in your barn  tonight?\"    The man eyed him closely. Tramps did not often come to his  out-of-the-way place.    \"Do you smoke?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then I have no objection, though I don't like tramps around the place.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    The man moved off, but turned again. \"Have you had any supper?\" he  asked.    \"No; but I do not care for anything to eat, thank you.\"    \"Strange tramp, that,\" said the man to himself, \"not to want anything to  eat. Well, go into the shanty and warm yourself, anyway.\"    In the shanty, Rupert found an old stove glowing with a hot fire, by the  side of which he seated himself. The night was chilly in that high  altitude, and Rupert spread out his palms to the warmth. Inside the  house, he heard the rattle of dishes and the voices of women. Then  strains of songs floated out to him, and he became an intent listener.  Soon from out the humming came two sweet voices, singing. Rupert sat as  one spellbound, as the song seemed to melt into his soul:      \"O my Father, thou that dwellest      In the high and glorious place!    When shall I regain thy presence,      And again behold thy face?    In thy holy habitation,      Did my spirit once reside;    In my first primeval childhood,      Was I nurtured near thy side.      \"For a wise and glorious purpose      Thou hast placed me here on earth,    And withheld the recollection      Of my former friends and birth;    Yet ofttimes a secret something      Whispered, You're a stranger here;    And I felt that I had wandered      From a more exalted sphere.      \"I had learned to call thee Father,      Through thy Spirit from on high;    But until the Key of Knowledge      Was restored, I knew not why.    In the heavens are parents single?      No; the thought makes reason stare.    Truth is reason; truth eternal      Tells me I've a mother there.      \"When I leave this frail existence,      When I lay this mortal by,    Father, mother, may I meet you      In your royal courts on high?    Then, at length, when I've completed      All you sent me forth to do,    With your mutual approbation      Let me come and dwell with you.\"    The door opened, and a young woman came out with a small tin pail in her  hand. At sight of Rupert she gave a startled cry and backed to the door.  Just then the young farmer passed through the shanty and explained that  it was only a \"traveler\" warming himself. The young woman looked  steadily at Rupert. The fire shone out from the open door of the stove,  and the light danced on the rough board walls, throwing a halo of red  around the girl.    \"What a sweet picture,\" instantly thought Rupert.    Then she slowly advanced again, and, instead of pouring the contents of  the pail into a larger dish as was her errand, she placed it on the  table by Rupert, and said, smilingly:    \"Vil you have a drink of varm milk?\"    \"Thank you, thank you.\"    Then she went back.    Warm milk! What could be more delicious? Rupert sipped the sweet fluid.  How it invigorated him and surcharged him with new life. And given by  such hands, with such a smile! It was a glimpse of past glories.    In the morning Rupert was asked if he wanted a job.    \"Yes,\" was the answer.    \"Can you work on a farm?\"    \"I've been a farmer all my life,\" was the reply. \"I'm not a tramp, as  you understand that term.\"    \"Well, stay around today and I'll see what I can do. I want some help,  but I cannot pay high wages.\"    \"Never mind the wages,\" said Rupert, \"we'll agree on that after a  while.\"    The young farmer saw that he had no common tramp to deal with, although  he looked rough and travel-stained.    \"I have been sick for the past few days,\" explained Rupert, \"and if you  can trust me, I should like to rest up a bit before I go to work. I'm  too weak to do you much good yet.\"    \"That'll be all right,\" was the answer. \"I see you need something to eat  this morning, even if you weren't hungry last night. Come with me to the  house.\"    So Rupert Ames remained with the farmer and did the chores around the  house until he became stronger, when he helped with the harder work. He  was treated kindly by them all, and it was not long before he mingled  freely with the family.    During this time Rupert realized that his right senses, as he called  them, were coming back to him, and every night he thanked God in vocal  prayer for his deliverance from a dark pit which seemed to have yawned  before him.    The Jansons were newcomers in the West, and had much to learn about  farming. Mr. Janson was a Swede who had been in the country twenty  years. His wife and her cousin were from Norway, the former having been  in the country long enough to become Americanized; it was two years only  since the latter had emigrated from her native land, so she spoke  English with a foreign accent. Her name was Signe Dahl (first name  pronounced in two syllables, Sig-ne). She attracted Rupert's attention  from the first. She had a complexion of pink and white, blue eyes, soft,  light hair; but it was not her peculiar beauty alone that attracted him.  There was something else about her, an atmosphere of peace and assurance  which Rupert could feel in her presence. Naturally, she was reticent at  first, but on learning to know Rupert, which she seemed to do  intuitively, she talked freely with him, and even seemed pleased with  his company.    Two weeks went by, and Rupert proffered to remain with Mr. Janson and  help him with his harvesting. The latter gladly accepted the offer, for  he had by this time learned that Rupert Ames could give him many  practical lessons in farming.    The song that Rupert heard that first evening continually rang in his  ears. He remembered some of the words, and, as he thought of them,  strange ideas came to him. One evening they were all sitting around the  fire in the living room. Rupert had been telling them some of his  history, and when the conversation lagged, he asked the two cousins to  sing that song about \"O my Father.\" They readily consented.    \"A most beautiful song,\" said Rupert at its close; \"and so strange. It  seems to bring me back for an instant to some former existence, if that  were possible. What does it mean:      'In thy holy habitation,      Did my spirit once reside;    In my first primeval childhood      Was I nurtured near thy side.'    \"What does it mean?\"    \"Signe, you explain it,\" said Mr. Janson. \"You know, you're a better  preacher than I am.\"    Signe made no excuses, but went to the little bookshelf and took from it  two books, her English and her Norwegian Bibles. She read for the most  part from the English now, but she always had the more familiar one at  hand to explain any doubtful passage.    \"I vill do wat I can, Mr. Ames. I cannot read English good, so you must  do de reading.\" She opened the book and pointed to the fourth verse of  the thirty-eighth chapter of the book of Job. Rupert read:      \"Where wast thou when I laid the foundation of the earth?    declare, if thou hast understanding. * * * When the morning    stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\"    \"Yes,\" said the reader, \"that is a great question, indeed. Where was  Job? Why, he was not yet born.\"    \"Who are de sons of God?\" asked Signe.    \"I suppose we--all of us, in a sense.\"    \"Of course; and ve all shouted for joy when God He laid de foundation of  de earth; so, ve must have been der, and known someting about it.\"    \"Yes, but how could we? We were not yet born.\"    \"No; not in dis world; but ve lived as spiritual children of our Fader  in heaven.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" remarked Rupert, doubtfully.    \"Of course you don't. Dat's why I tell you.\"    They all smiled at that. Signe again turned the leaves of her Bible.  \"Read here,\" said she.    This time it was the first chapter of St. John. He read the first  fourteen verses.    \"Dat vil do; now read here.\" She returned to the sixth chapter,  sixty-second verse, and he read:      \"What and if ye see the Son of man ascend up to where He was before.\"    She turned to another. It was the twenty-eighth verse of chapter  sixteen:      \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again,    I leave the world and go to the Father.\"    Still she made him read one more, the fifth verse of the seventeenth  chapter:      \"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the    glory which I had with thee before the world was.\"    \"Now, vat does it all mean, Mr. Ames?\"    \"I see your point, Miss Dahl. Christ certainly existed as an intelligent  being before He came to this earth--yes, even before the world was.\"    \"Certainly; our Savior vas himself as ve. He vas born, He had a body as  ve, and He also had a spirit. God is de Fader of His spirit and it  existed long ago, as you said. Christ is our Elder Broder. Ve are of de  same family. If He existed before de vorld, why not ve? Dat's right,  isn't it?\"    \"But couldn't Christ have been the only one who had a pre-existence? I  believe something is said in your book about the Savior being the only  begotten of the Father.\"    \"Yes, in de flesh; dat is true, but God is de Fader of all spirits who  have come to dis world to take a body. I can find you many passages to  prove it.\"    \"Well, I have never thought of these things before, but it must be true  if the Bible means what it says. That's a grand principle, Mr. Janson.\"    \"It certainly is, Mr. Ames. Many people object to it; but I"]]]
