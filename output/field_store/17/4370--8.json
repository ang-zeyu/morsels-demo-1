On that day the faithful  shall rejoice in the victory of God, and the disbelievers shall lament.    95 None must contend with those who wield authority over the people; leave  unto them that which is theirs, and direct your attention to men's hearts.    96 O Most Mighty Ocean! Sprinkle upon the nations that with which Thou  hast been charged by Him Who is the Sovereign of Eternity, and adorn the  temples of all the dwellers of the earth with the vesture of His laws  through which all hearts will rejoice and all eyes be brightened.    97 Should anyone acquire one hundred mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of gold, nineteen  mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals thereof are God's and to be rendered unto Him, the Fashioner of  earth and heaven. Take heed, O people, lest ye deprive yourselves of so  great a bounty. This We have commanded you, though We are well able to  dispense with you and with all who are in the heavens and on earth; in it  there are benefits and wisdoms beyond the ken of anyone but God, the  Omniscient, the All-Informed. Say: By this means He hath desired to purify  what ye possess and to enable you to draw nigh unto such stations as none  can comprehend save those whom God hath willed. He, in truth, is the  Beneficent, the Gracious, the Bountiful. O people! Deal not faithlessly  with the Right of God, nor, without His leave, make free with its  disposal. Thus hath His commandment been established in the holy Tablets,  and in this exalted Book. He who dealeth faithlessly with God shall in  justice meet with faithlessness himself; he, however, who acteth in  accordance with God's bidding shall receive a blessing from the heaven of  the bounty of his Lord, the Gracious, the Bestower, the Generous, the  Ancient of Days. He, verily, hath willed for you that which is yet beyond  your knowledge, but which shall be known to you when, after this fleeting  life, your souls soar heavenwards and the trappings of your earthly joys  are folded up. Thus admonisheth you He in Whose possession is the Guarded  Tablet.    98 Various petitions have come before Our throne from the believers,  concerning laws from God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of  all worlds. We have, in consequence, revealed this Holy Tablet and arrayed  it with the mantle of His Law that haply the people may keep the  commandments of their Lord. Similar requests had been made of Us over  several previous years but We had, in Our wisdom, withheld Our Pen until,  in recent days, letters arrived from a number of the friends, and We have  therefore responded, through the power of truth, with that which shall  quicken the hearts of men.    99 Say: O leaders of religion! Weigh not the Book of God with such  standards and sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is  the unerring Balance established amongst men. In this most perfect Balance  whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed,  while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own  standard, did ye but know it.    100 The eye of My loving-kindness weepeth sore over you, inasmuch as ye  have failed to recognize the One upon Whom ye have been calling in the  daytime and in the night season, at even and at morn. Advance, O people,  with snow-white faces and radiant hearts, unto the blest and crimson Spot,  wherein the Sadratu'l-Muntaha is calling: \"Verily, there is none other God  beside Me, the Omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting!\"    101 O ye leaders of religion! Who is the man amongst you that can rival Me  in vision or insight? Where is he to be found that dareth to claim to be  My equal in utterance or wisdom? No, by My Lord, the All-Merciful! All on  the earth shall pass away; and this is the face of your Lord, the  Almighty, the Well-Beloved.    102 We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end of all  learning be the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge; and  yet, behold how ye have allowed your learning to shut you out, as by a  veil, from Him Who is the Dayspring of this Light, through Whom every  hidden thing hath been revealed. Could ye but discover the source whence  the splendour of this utterance is diffused, ye would cast away the  peoples of the world and all that they possess, and would draw nigh unto  this most blessed Seat of glory.    103 Say: This, verily, is the heaven in which the Mother Book is  treasured, could ye but comprehend it. He it is Who hath caused the Rock  to shout, and the Burning Bush to lift up its voice, upon the Mount rising  above the Holy Land, and proclaim: \"The Kingdom is God's, the sovereign  Lord of all, the All-Powerful, the Loving!\"    104 We have not entered any school, nor read any of your dissertations.  Incline your ears to the words of this unlettered One, wherewith He  summoneth you unto God, the Ever-Abiding. Better is this for you than all  the treasures of the earth, could ye but comprehend it.    105 Whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of  Revelation, and altereth its evident meaning, he, verily, is of them that  have perverted the Sublime Word of God, and is of the lost ones in the  Lucid Book.    106 It hath been enjoined upon you to pare your nails, to bathe yourselves  each week in water that covereth your bodies, and to clean yourselves with  whatsoever ye have formerly employed. Take heed lest through negligence ye  fail to observe that which hath been prescribed unto you by Him Who is the  Incomparable, the Gracious. Immerse yourselves in clean water; it is not  permissible to bathe yourselves in water that hath already been used. See  that ye approach not the public pools of Persian baths; whoso maketh his  way toward such baths will smell their fetid odour ere he entereth  therein. Shun them, O people, and be not of those who ignominiously accept  such vileness. In truth, they are as sinks of foulness and contamination,  if ye be of them that apprehend. Avoid ye likewise the malodorous pools in  the courtyards of Persian homes, and be ye of the pure and sanctified.  Truly, We desire to behold you as manifestations of paradise on earth,  that there may be diffused from you such fragrance as shall rejoice the  hearts of the favoured of God. If the bather, instead of entering the  water, wash himself by pouring it upon his body, it shall be better for  him and shall absolve him of the need for bodily immersion. The Lord,  verily, hath willed, as a bounty from His presence, to make life easier  for you that ye may be of those who are truly thankful.    107 It is forbidden you to wed your fathers' wives. We shrink, for very  shame, from treating of the subject of boys. Fear ye the Merciful, O  peoples of the world! Commit not that which is forbidden you in Our Holy  Tablet, and be not of those who rove distractedly in the wilderness of  their desires.    108 To none is it permitted to mutter sacred verses before the public gaze  as he walketh in the street or marketplace; nay rather, if he wish to  magnify the Lord, it behoveth him to do so in such places as have been  erected for this purpose, or in his own home. This is more in keeping with  sincerity and godliness. Thus hath the sun of Our commandment shone forth  above the horizon of Our utterance. Blessed, then, be those who do Our  bidding.    109 Unto everyone hath been enjoined the writing of a will. The testator  should head this document with the adornment of the Most Great Name, bear  witness therein unto the oneness of God in the Dayspring of His  Revelation, and make mention, as he may wish, of that which is  praiseworthy, so that it may be a testimony for him in the kingdoms of  Revelation and Creation and a treasure with his Lord, the Supreme  Protector, the Faithful.    110 All Feasts have attained their consummation in the two Most Great  Festivals, and in the two other Festivals that fall on the twin days--the  first of the Most Great Festivals being those days whereon the  All-Merciful shed upon the whole of creation the effulgent glory of His  most excellent Names and His most exalted Attributes, and the second being  that day on which We raised up the One Who announced unto mankind the glad  tidings of this Name, through which the dead have been resurrected and all  who are in the heavens and on earth have been gathered together. Thus hath  it been decreed by Him Who is the Ordainer, the Omniscient.    111 Happy the one who entereth upon the first day of the month of Baha,  the day which God hath consecrated to this Great Name. And blessed be he  who evidenceth on this day the bounties that God hath bestowed upon him;  he, verily, is of those who show forth thanks to God through actions  betokening the Lord's munificence which hath encompassed all the worlds.  Say: This day, verily, is the crown of all the months and the source  thereof, the day on which the breath of life is wafted over all created  things. Great is the blessedness of him who greeteth it with radiance and  joy. We testify that he is, in truth, among those who are blissful.    112 Say: The Most Great Festival is, indeed, the King of Festivals. Call  ye to mind, O people, the bounty which God hath conferred upon you. Ye  were sunk in slumber, and lo! He aroused you by the reviving breezes of  His Revelation, and made known unto you His manifest and undeviating Path.    113 Resort ye, in times of sickness, to competent physicians; We have not  set aside the use of material means, rather have We confirmed it through  this Pen, which God hath made to be the Dawning-place of His shining and  glorious Cause.    114 God had formerly laid upon each one of the believers the duty of  offering before Our throne priceless gifts from among his possessions.

It will be remembered that the murdered Mackeson was succeeded  as Commissioner of Peshawar by Herbert Edwardes, one of the most  remarkable men that the Indian army has ever produced, and who, as I  have already mentioned, entirely concurred in my father's expressed  opinion as to the great advantage it would be for the Government of  India to enter into more friendly relations with the Ruler of Kabul.  They both held that the constant troubles all along our frontier were  in a great measure due to the Amir's hostility, and that such troubles  would increase rather than diminish unless we could succeed in  establishing an _entente cordiale_ with Dost Mahomed.    In 1854 Edwardes had a correspondence with the Governor-General on the  subject, and on one occasion expressed himself as follows: 'My own  feeling is, that we have much injured Dost Mahomed, and may very well  afford to let by-gones be by-gones. It would contribute much to  the security of this frontier if open relations of goodwill were  established at Kabul. There is a sullenness in our present relations,  as if both parties were brooding over the past, and expecting an  opportunity in the future. This keeps up excitement and unrest, and  prevents our influence and institutions taking root. I should be very  glad to see a new account opened on the basis of an open treaty of  friendship and alliance.'    Lord Dalhousie was quite in accord with Edwardes. He thought it very  desirable to be on better terms with Kabul, but believed this to be  a result difficult to attain. 'I give you,' he said in a letter to  Edwardes, _carte blanche_, and if you can only bring about such a  result as you propose, it will be a new feather in your cap.'    Lord Dalhousie was supported by the British Government in his opinion  as to the desirability of coming to a better understanding with the  Amir. War with Russia was then imminent, and the strained condition of  European politics made it expedient that we should be on more amicable  terms with Afghanistan.    The Governor-General thus wrote to Edwardes:    'Prospects of a war between Russia and Turkey are watched with  interest by all.... In England they are fidgety regarding this border  beyond all reason, and most anxious for that declared amity and that  formal renewal of friendly relations which you advocate in your  letter.'    The balance of Indian opinion, however, was against our making  overtures to Dost Mahomed. John Lawrence, at that time the great power  in the Punjab, was altogether opposed to Edwardes's policy in this  matter. He admitted that it might be wise to renew intercourse  with the Kabul ruler if he first expressed his regret for previous  misunderstandings; but later he wrote to Edwardes:        'I dare say you are right; still, I cannot divest myself of the      idea that it is _a mistake_, and will end in mixing us up in      Afghan politics and affairs more than is desirable. The strength      which a treaty can give us seems to be a delusion. It will be like      the reed on which, if a man lean, it will break and pierce his      hand.'    John Nicholson, Outram, and James Abbott agreed with Lawrence.  They urged that any advance on our part would be looked upon as an  indication of conscious weakness; and the probability was that an  arrogant, irritated Mussulman ruler would regard an overture as a  proof of our necessity, and would make our necessity his opportunity.  But Lord Dalhousie, while anxious to avoid any communication being  made which could be liable to misconstruction, saw neither objection  nor risk in opening the door to reconciliation, provided no undue  anxiety was displayed on our part. The Governor-General practically  left the matter in the hands of Edwardes, who lost no time in trying  to attain the desired object. The greatest forbearance and diplomatic  skill were necessary to bring the negotiations to a satisfactory  termination, but they were concluded at last, most successfully, and  to Edwardes alone is due the credit. It is instructive to read the  full record[1] of this tedious and difficult piece of diplomacy,  for it serves as an interesting example of Oriental subtlety and  circumlocution, contrasted with the straightforward dealing of a  high-minded Englishman.    The Amir wrote a letter to the Governor-General couched in most  satisfactory terms, which he forwarded to Peshawar by the hand of his  confidential secretary, and which received, as it deserved, a very  friendly reply. This resulted in Dost Mahomed sending his son and  heir-apparent, Sardar Ghulam Haidar Khan, to Peshawar, and deputing  him to act as his Plenipotentiary in the negotiations. Ghulam Haidar  Khan reached Peshawar in March, 1855, where he was met by the Chief  Commissioner, and on the 30th of that month the treaty was concluded.  'It guaranteed that we should respect the Amir's possessions in  Afghanistan, and never interfere with them; while the Amir engaged  similarly to respect British territory, and to be the friend of our  friends and the enemy of our enemies.'    The Governor-General had at first resolved to entrust to Edwardes the  duty of meeting the expected Envoy from Kabul, and orders to that  effect were issued. But Edwardes, more anxious for the success of  the negotiations than for his own honour and glory, wrote to  Lord Dalhousie suggesting that the Government of India should be  represented by the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, and promising to  afford Sir John Lawrence all the assistance in his power. Edwardes  believed that the importance of the treaty would be enhanced in the  eyes of the Afghans by the presence of the higher official; and in  this opinion the Governor-General concurred. On the conclusion of the  treaty, Lord Dalhousie wrote to Edwardes: 'I congratulate you and  myself and all else concerned on this successful issue of the  negotiations, which have now lasted just a year.'    This treaty of March, 1855, was only preliminary to that for the  ratification of which the Amir came in person to Peshawar the  following year.    Towards the end of 1855 Dost Mahomed found himaelf in considerable  difficulties, and appealed to us for assistance. A revolt had occurred  at Herat, and a Persian army was preparing to besiege that fortress;  the chiefs and people of Kandahar were disaffected; and the province  of Balkh was threatened with invasion both by the King of Bokhara and  by Turkoman hordes. The Amir looked upon Herat as an integral part of  the Afghan dominions, and was very desirous of re-establishing his  authority over that place and preventing its falling into the hands of  the Persians; but he felt himself too weak to have any hope of success  without help from us in men and money. It was, therefore, Dost  Mahomed's interest to convince the British Government that the Shah  had infringed the conditions of an engagement entered into with us in  1853, under which Persia abandoned all claim to Herat. The Amir thus  hoped to establish a quarrel between England and Persia for his own  benefit, and to secure our assistance against the latter power. To  further this design, Dost Mahomed offered to come to Peshawar and  consult with the British authorities. Edwardes was in favour of the  proposed visit. John Lawrence was opposed to it, saying he did not  think much good would result from such a meeting, because it could  hardly be anticipated that the views of the Amir and the British  Government would coincide, and if Dost Mahomed should fail to obtain  what he wanted, his dissatisfaction would be a positive evil. The  Governor-General admitted the force of these objections, but in the  end considered that they should be set aside if the Amir was in  earnest in desiring a consultation. 'A refusal or an evasion to comply  with his wish,' Lord Dalhousie thought, 'might be misunderstood, and  although a meeting might lead to disappointment and disagreement, it  would, at any rate, put the relations of the British Government with  the Amir, as regards Herat, upon a clear footing.'    While this discussion was going on, the advance of a Persian army for  the purpose of besieging Herat, coupled with the insults offered to  the British flag at Teheran, led to the declaration of war between  England and Persia. The Chief Commissioner was therefore directed to  tell the Amir that he would be paid a periodical subsidy to aid him  in carrying on hostile operations against Persia, subject to certain  conditions. On receiving these instructions, the Chief Commissioner  directed Edwardes to invite the Amir to an interview. Dost Mahomed  accepted the invitation, but before the auspicious meeting could take  place Lord Dalhousie had left India, and Lord Canning reigned in his  stead. Lord Dalhousie resigned on the 29th February, 1856, after  having filled the arduous and responsible position of Governor-General  for no less than eight years, adding year by year fresh lustre to his  splendid reputation.    The first day of 1857 witnessed the meeting between the Amir of Kabul  and the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab. The Amir's camp was pitched  at the mouth of the Khyber Pass, and that of the Chief Commissioner on  the plain near Jamrud. Barr's troop of Horse Artillery formed part of  the escort, so I was in the midst of it all. On the occasion of the  Amir's first visit to the English camp, there was a force present  of upwards of 7,000 soldiers, including three regiments of British  Infantry; the troops lined the road for more than a mile, and it was  evident that their strength and soldierly appearance inspired the  Amir and his followers with a very salutary feeling of awe and  admiration.[2]    The result of the conferences between"]]]
