Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of the  private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. The tuna  canneries and the government are by far the two largest employers.  Other economic activities include a slowly developing tourist  industry. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to  American Samoa's economic well-being. According to one observer,  attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are  restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and  its devastating hurricanes.

I told her we had just had our supper, but  she waited until I had theirs ready before she announced that neither  she nor Archie ate hot biscuits or steak, that they didn't take tea for  supper, preferred coffee, and that neither of them could eat peaches or  honey. So all of my supper was ruled off except the butter and cream.  She went down to their wagons and brought up what she wanted, so Tam  Campbell was the only one who ate my honey and biscuit.    Tam is just a Scot with an amazingly close fist, and he is very  absent-minded. I had met Annie, his wife, and their six children. She  told me of his absent-mindedness. Her remedy for his trouble when it  came to household needs was to repeat the article two or three times in  the list. People out like we are buy a year's supply at a time. So a  list of needed things is made up and sent into town. Tam always managed  to forget a great many things.    Well, bedtime came. I offered to show them to their room, but Aggie  said, \"We'll nae sleep in your bed. We'll jest bide in the kitchen.\" I  could not persuade her to change her mind. Tam slept at the barn in  order to see after the \"beasties,\" should they need attention during  the night. As I was preparing for bed, Aggie thrust her head into my  room and announced that she would be up at three o'clock. I am not an  early bird, so I thought I would let Aggie get her own breakfast, and I  told her she would find everything in the pantry. As long as I was  awake I could hear Archie and Aggie talking, but I could not imagine  what about. I didn't know their habits so well as I came to later. Next  morning the rumbling of their wagons awakened me, but I turned over and  slept until after six.    There are always so many things to do before leaving that it was nine  o'clock before we got started. We had only gotten about two miles, when  Mr. Stewart remembered he had not locked the granary, so back we  trotted. We nooned only a few miles from home. We knew we could not  catch the wagons before camping-time unless we drove very hard, so Mr.  Stewart said we would go by the Edmonsons' and spend the night there. I  enjoy even the memory of that drive through the short spring  afternoon,--the warm red sand of the desert; the Wind River Mountains  wrapped in the blue veil of distance; the sparse gray-green sage, ugly  in itself, but making complete a beautiful picture; the occasional  glimpse we had of shy, beautiful wild creatures. So much happiness can  be crowded into so short a time. I was glad, though, when Cora Belle's  home became a part of our beautiful picture. It is situated among great  red buttes, and there is a blue lake back of the house. Around the lake  is a fringe of willows. Their house is a low, rambling affair, with a  long, low porch and a red clay roof. Before the house is a cotton-wood  tree, its gnarled, storm-twisted branches making it seem to have the  \"rheumatiz.\" There is a hop-vine at one end of the porch. It had not  come out when we were there, but the dead vine clung hopelessly to its  supports.    Little Cora Belle just bubbled with delight, and her grandparents were  scarcely better than she. Spring house-cleaning was just finished, and  they have company so seldom that they made us feel that we were doing  them a favor by stopping. Poor old \"Pa\" hobbled out to help put the  team away, and when they came back, Cora Belle asked me out to help  prepare supper, so I left Mr. Stewart with \"Granny\" and \"Pa\" to listen  to their recitals and to taste their many medicines. Cora Belle is  really an excellent housekeeper. Her cooking would surprise many  people. Her bread was delicious, and I am sure I never tasted anything  better than the roasted leg of lamb she gave us for supper. I am  ashamed to tell you how much I ate of her carrot jam. From where I sat  I had a splendid view of the sunset across the lake. Speaking of things  singly, Wyoming has nothing beautiful to offer. Taken altogether, it is  grandly beautiful, and at sunrise and sunset the \"heavens declare His  glory.\"    Cora Belle is so animated and so straightforward, so entirely clean in  all her thoughts and actions, that she commands love and respect at one  and the same time. After supper her grandfather asked her to sing and  play for us. Goodness only knows where they got the funny little old  organ that Cora Belle thinks so much of. It has spots all over it of  medicine that has been spilled at different times, and it has, as Cora  Belle said, lost its voice in spots; but that doesn't set back Cora  Belle at all, she plays away just as if it was all right. Some of the  keys keep up a mournful whining and groaning, entirely outside of the  tune. Cora Belle says they play themselves. After several \"pieces\" had  been endured, \"Pa\" said, \"Play my piece, Cory Belle\"; so we had \"Bingen  on the Rhine\" played and sung from A to izzard. Dear old \"Pa,\" his  pain-twisted old face just beamed with pride. I doubt if heaven will  have for him any sweeter music than his \"baby's\" voice. Granny's  squeaky, trembly old voice trailed in after Cora Belle's, always a word  or two behind. \"Tell my friends and companions when they meet and  _scrouge_ around\"; that is the way they sang it, but no one would have  cared for that, if they had noticed with what happy eagerness the two  sang together. The grandparents would like to have sat up all night  singing and telling of things that happened in bygone days, but poor  tired little Cora Belle began to nod, so we retired. As we were  preparing for bed it suddenly occurred to Mr. Stewart that I had not  been surprised when going to town was mentioned, so he said, \"Wooman,  how did it happen that you were ready when I was to gae to the toone?\"  \"Oh,\" I said, \"I knew you were going.\" \"Who tell it ye?\" \"A little  bird.\" \"'T was some fool wooman, mayhap.\" I didn't feel it necessary to  enlighten him, and I think he is still wondering how I knew.    Next morning we were off early, but we didn't come up with the wagons  until almost camping-time. The great heavily-loaded wagons were  creaking along over the heavy sands. The McEttricks were behind,  Aggie's big frame swaying and lurching with every jolt of the wagon.  They never travel without their German socks. They are great thick  things to wear on the outside of their shoes. As we came up behind  them, we could see Aggie's big socks dangling and bobbing beside  Archie's from where they were tied on the back part of the wagon. We  could hear them talking and see them gesticulating. When we came  nearer, we found they were quarreling, and they kept at it as long as I  was awake that night. After the men had disposed of their loads, they  and Mr. Stewart were going out of town to where a new coal-mine was  being opened. I intended to go on the train to Rock Springs to do some  shopping. Aggie said she was going also. I suggested that we get a room  together, as we would have to wait several hours for the train, but she  was suspicious of my motives. She is greatly afraid of being \"done,\" so  she told me to get my own room and pay for it. We got into town about  three o'clock in the afternoon, and the train left at midnight.    I had gone to my room, and Jerrine and myself were enjoying a good rest  after our fatiguing drive, when my door was thrown open and a very  angry Aggie strode in. They asked us fifty cents each for our rooms.  Aggie paid hers under protest and afterward got to wondering how long  she was entitled to its use. She had gone back to the clerk about it,  and he had told her for that night only. She argued that she should  have her room for a quarter, as she would only use it until midnight.  When that failed, she asked for her money back, but the clerk was out  of patience and refused her that. Aggie was angry all through. She  vowed she was being robbed. After she had berated me soundly for  submitting so tamely, she flounced back to her own room, declaring she  would get even with the robbers. I had to hurry like everything that  night to get myself and Jerrine ready for the train, so I could spare  no time for Aggie. She was not at the depot, and Jerrine and I had to  go on to Rock Springs without her. It is only a couple of hours from  Green River to Rock Springs, so I had a good nap and a late breakfast.  I did my shopping and was back at Green River at two that afternoon.  The first person I saw was Aggie. She sat in the depot, glowering at  everybody. She had a basket of eggs and a pail of butter, which she had  been trying to sell. She was waiting for the night train, the only one  she could get to Rock Springs. I asked her had she overslept. \"No, I  didna,\" she replied. Then, she proceeded to tell me that, as she had  paid for a whole night's use of a room, she had stayed to get its use.  That it had made her plans miscarry didn't seem to count.    After all our business was attended to, we started for home. The wagons  were half a day ahead of us. When we came in sight, we could see Aggie  fanning the air with her long arms, and we knew they were quarreling. I  remarked that I could not understand how persons who hated each other  so could live together. Clyde told me I had much to learn, and said  that really he knew of no other couple who were actually so devoted. He  said to prove it I should ask Aggie into the buggy with me and he would  get in with Archie, and afterwards we would compare notes. He drove up  alongside of them, and Aggie seemed glad to make the exchange. As we  had the buggy, we drove ahead of the wagons. It seems that Archie and  Aggie are each jealous of the other. Archie is as ugly a little monkey  as it would be possible to imagine. She bemeaned him until at last I  asked her why she didn't leave him, and added that I would not stand  such crankiness for one moment. Then she poured out the vials of her  wrath upon my head, only I don't think they were vials but"]]]
