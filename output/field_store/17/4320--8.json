The village is not divided into  wards; the number of its inhabitants being too small to require such  division. Instead of a board of aldermen, there is a board of _trustees_  or _directors_, who exercise similar powers. The president of a village  is generally chosen by the trustees from their own number. In some  states, incorporated villages are called _towns_; and their chief  executive officer is called _mayor_.    Sec.7. The necessity and effect of incorporating a village may not yet  clearly appear to every reader. Let us illustrate. By a general law of  the state, or by a vote of the electors of a township in pursuance of  such law, cattle may run at large in the highways. This might be to many  persons in a village, a great annoyance, which can be prevented or  abated only by confining the cattle. Or, sidewalks may need to be made.  Or, it may be deemed necessary to provide means for extinguishing fires,  by purchasing fire-engines and organizing fire companies. In an  unincorporated village there is no power to compel the citizens to do  these things. Those, therefore, who desire that the citizens should have  power to make all needful regulations for the government of the village,  petition the legislature for an act of incorporation granting the  necessary powers.    Sec.8. The constitutions of some states require the legislature to pass a  general law prescribing the manner in which the people of any village  may form themselves into a corporation, with the necessary powers of  government, with out a special law for that purpose.    Sec.9. Besides these _territorial_ corporations for purposes of government,  as counties, towns, cities, &c., there are _incorporated companies_ for  carrying on business of various kinds, as turnpike and rail-road  companies, and companies for the purposes of banking, insurance,  manufacturing, &c. These kinds of business, to be carried on  successfully, sometimes require a larger amount of money than one man  possesses. A number of persons, therefore, unite their capital under an  act of incorporation granting them power to manage their business which  they could not have in an ordinary business partnership. Besides, a  common partnership must end on the death of any one of the partners; but  an incorporated company is not thus affected by the death of its  members.    Sec.10. It is in the nature of corporations to have a perpetual existence.  A corporation may live after the persons who first composed it are all  dead; for those who come after them have the same powers and privileges.  A town or city incorporated a hundred years ago, is the same town or  city still, although none of its first inhabitants are living. So a  railroad or banking corporation may exist after the death of many, or  even all of the original corporators.    Sec.11. But there are certain particulars in which all corporations are not  the same. A state has been defined to be a body politic, or corporation.  (Chap. I. Sec.10; III, Sec.5.) But it differs from other government  corporations, as counties, towns, cities, &c., in this: the latter are  formed by acts of the legislature; but a state is formed by the people  in their political capacity in establishing the constitution.    Sec.12. Again, all these government corporations differ from incorporated  business companies. In forming a town or city, many persons are brought  into the corporation against their wishes or consent; because, in  governments, all who live within certain prescribed bounds must come  under the same laws; but of an incorporated business association, as of  a common business partnership, none become members but by their own act  or choice. There is another difference: The latter are what are called  _stock_ companies; and although they may be continued after the death of  the first corporators, those who afterward come into the association, do  so by becoming owners of the capital stock of those who preceded them.  This latter difference will more clearly appear from the more particular  description, elsewhere given, of the incorporated companies, and of the  manner in which the stock is transferred. (Chap. XXIII, Sec.11--15.)          Chapter XVII.    Judicial Department. Justices' Courts.        Sec.1. Having seen how the legislative and executive departments of a state  government are constituted, and how the laws are made and executed, the  manner in which the local affairs of counties and towns are conducted,  and the powers and duties of their respective officers; we proceed to  describe the _judicial_ department, the powers and duties of judicial  officers, and the manner in which justice is administered.    Sec.2. It is the business of the legislature to determine what acts shall  be deemed public offenses, or crimes, and to make laws for securing  justice to the citizens in their dealings and general intercourse with  each other; but to judge of and apply the laws; that is, to determine  what the law is and whether it has been broken, and to fix the just  measure of damage or of punishment, and to order such decision to be  carried into effect, are duties which, as has been observed, have been  wisely assigned to a separate and distinct department. (Chap. VIII. Sec.7.)    Sec.3. A government without some power to decide disputes, to award  justice, and to punish crime according to the laws of the state, would  not be complete. To allow every man to be his own judge in cases of  supposed injury, and to redress his own wrongs, would endanger the  rights of others. Justice is best secured to the citizens by  establishing courts for the redress of injuries and the punishment of  crimes; and that no person may suffer unjustly, it is provided that  every person charged with crime or any other wrong, is entitled to a  fair and impartial trial.    Sec.4. For the convenience of persons who may be compelled to seek relief  at law, courts are established in every town. These are courts of the  lowest grade, and are called _justices' courts_, being held by justices  of the peace who are, in most of the states, elected by the people of  the several towns. They are called the lowest courts, because they have  jurisdiction only in cases in which the smallest sums or damages are  claimed, or in which only the lowest offenses are tried. The word  _jurisdiction_ is from the Latin _jus_, law, or _juris_, of the law, and  _dictio_, a pronouncing or speaking. Hence the _jurisdiction_ of a court  means its power to pronounce the law.    Sec.5. Although justices of the peace are generally elected in the towns,  their jurisdiction extends over the county; that is, they have power to  try causes arising in any part of the county, or between citizens  residing in other towns. The jurisdiction of justices of the peace is  generally prescribed by law. The law prescribes the sum that may be sued  for, or the amount of damage that may be recovered in a justice's court,  and the grade of offenses that may be tried in it. In some states  justices of the peace may try suits only in which the sum in controversy  does not exceed $50; but in most of them, the jurisdiction of a justice  extends, it is believed, to sums of $100 or more.    Sec.6. Causes, in which money is claimed for damage or for debt, are called  _civil_ causes; those for the trial of persons charged with crime, or  some misdemeanor, are called _criminal_ causes. All crimes, strictly  speaking, are misdemeanors. In common usage, however, the word  _misdemeanor_ denotes a smaller offense, such as is usually punishable  by fine, or by imprisonment in a county jail, and not in a state prison.  Causes, actions, and suits, are words of similar meaning in law  language, being generally used to signify prosecutions at law, or  lawsuits. The party that sues is called _plaintiff_; the party sued is  the _defendant_.    Sec.7. Prosecutions at law are conducted in nearly the same manner in the  different states. The following is a sketch of the proceedings in an  ordinary civil suit in a justice's court: The justice, at the request of  the plaintiff, issues a _summons_, which is a writ or precept addressed  to a constable of the town, in some states to any constable of the  county, commanding him to summon the defendant to appear before the  justice on a day and at an hour specified, to answer the plaintiff  (naming him) in a suit, the nature of which is stated in the summons.    Sec.8. The constable serves the summons by reading it or stating the  substance of it to the defendant; and if requested, gives him a copy of  it. If he does not find the defendant, he leaves a copy at his place of  residence with some one of the family of proper age. At or before the  time named for trial, the constable returns to the justice the summons  with an indorsement stating the day on which it was served, and whether  served personally or by copy. If served by copy, and the defendant does  not appear at the time named for trial, a new summons is issued, as the  practice is in some states--perhaps all of them; and the trial may not  proceed unless a summons has been personally served.    Sec.9. The parties may appear in person, or by attorney. An _attorney_ is  any person lawfully appointed to transact business for another; hence  the word attorney does not always mean an attorney at law, or lawyer,  who is properly an officer of a court of law. When the parties have  appeared and answered to their names, they make their _pleadings_; that  is, the plantiff declares for what he brings his suit; and the defendant  states the nature of what he has to _offset_ against the demand of the  plaintiff, or denies the demand altogether. These acts of the parties  are called _joining issue_.    Sec.10. If the parties are ready for trial, the justice proceeds to try the  issue. If the witnesses have not been subpoened and are not in  attendance, the cause is adjourned to a future day; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#12)"],[1,"Quick! Quick! I  have seen them again!\"    An unpleasant chill communicated itself to me.    \"The eyes!\" she whispered. \"Two great eyes have followed me! That was  why I knocked at your door. I was afraid.\"    It was enough, the mention of two great eyes. Leaving my visitor  temporarily to take care of herself, I sprang to the door and closed  it hurriedly. As I turned, in the light from the partly open study  door I saw the woman walking slowly ahead of me. I overtook her,  holding the door fully open for her to pass in.    \"Please sit down a while,\" I said. \"You have evidently been seriously  alarmed.\"    Still there was no sign from Coates, whose voice would have been  welcome music to my ears, for I could not reconcile myself to this  woman's presence, strive how I might, nor could I understand how she  had come to be wandering alone in such a place at that hour. One bond  of sympathy there was between us. I could forgive any one fearing  those awful eyes, for I had feared them myself; and I could no longer  doubt that some strange apparition was haunting the vicinity.    \"Believe me, I quite understand,\" I said, turning to my visitor. \"It  is most extraordinary, but I believe there is some unusually large cat  frequenting the neighborhood at present.\"    I stood by the side table and was on the point of pouring out a glass  of water when the woman raised her white-gloved hand in a gesture of  refusal.    \"Thank you,\" she said, \"thank you, but I am quite recovered, and  indeed if the cause of my alarm is no more than a cat, as you say, I  will proceed.\"    She laughed, and her laughter was low-pitched, but very musical. In  the light of the shaded table-lamp I could see the gleam of white  teeth through her veil, but I could not imagine why she swathed  herself in that manner. Yet in spite of this enwrapping she could not  disguise the fact that she possessed remarkably large and beautiful  eyes. She seemed now to have recovered her composure, but I noted that  she made no attempt to remove her veil.    \"Are you quite sure that you will not be nervous on your way?\" I  asked.    \"Oh, no. I am staying with some friends quite near,\" she explained,  detecting my curiosity; \"and I was indiscreet enough to wander out at  this hour to post a letter.\"    Possibly this explanation might have satisfied me; it is even possible  that I should have thought little more about the incident at that time  when I lived in a constant turmoil of episodes even stranger, but by  one of those accidents which sometimes seem to be directed by the hand  of an impish fate, I was to learn who or what my visitor was. When I  say I was to learn what she was, perhaps I err; more correctly I was  to learn what she was not, namely, an ordinary human being.    It was as she rose to depart that the hand of fate intervened. I had  only one lamp burning in the room, a table-lamp; and at this moment,  preceded by a sudden accession of light due to some flaw of the  generating plant, the filament expired, plunging the room into  darkness! I stood up with a startled cry. I do not deny that I felt  ill at ease in the gloom with my strange visitor; but worse was to  come. Looking across the darkened room to the chair upon which she was  seated, I saw a pair of blazing eyes regarding me fixedly!    Something in their horrid, luminous watchfulness told me that my  slightest movement was perceptible to my uncanny visitor of whom I  could see nothing but those two fiery eyes.    What I did or what occurred within the next few seconds I am not  prepared to state in detail. I know I uttered a hoarse cry and threw  myself back from those dreadful eyes which seemed to be advancing upon  me. The cry awakened Coates. I heard the pad of his bare feet upon the  floor as he leaped out of bed, and an instant later his door was  opened and he came blundering out into the darkened passage.    \"Hello, sir!\" he cried, in a half-dazed voice. \"Here, Coates!\" I  replied, and my tones were far from normal.    Falling over a chair on his way, Coates came running into the study.  An impression I had of a flying shape, and the dimly seen square of  the open window (for that side of the cottage lay in shadow) seemed  momentarily to become blackened.    \"Bring a light, Coates!\" I cried. \"The lamp has gone out.\"    \"Matches on the table, sir,\" said Coates.    Instantly I remembered that this was the case, that they lay in fact  near to my hand. I struck one, and in its flickering light looked  about the room. My visitor had gone--palpably through the window, for  certainly the front door had not been opened.    \"She has gone, Coates!\" I exclaimed.    And on this occasion it was Coates who repeated in an amazed voice:    \"_She_?\"    But even as he spoke, my attention had become diverted.    I was staring at that portion of the table upon which Maspero's book  lay. Beside it had stood the little Bubastis statuette ... but the  statuette was there no longer!          CHAPTER IX    THE VELVET CURTAIN      \"This gets me well out of my depth, Mr. Addison,\" said Inspector  Gatton.    We were standing in the garden at a point near to my open study  window. A small flower-bed intervened between the path and the high  privet hedge. It lay much in shade, and Coates had set tobacco plants  there. But the soil was softer here than elsewhere.    Clearly marked upon it were the imprints of little high-heeled shoes.    \"It seems to take us back to the days of 'Spring-heeled Jack,'\" my  friend continued; \"which was before my time! I don't think _that_  mystery was ever cleared up?\"    \"No,\" I replied, meeting his questioning glance; \"it never was,  satisfactorily. Therefore the analogy is an unfortunate one. But as  you say, it certainly looks as though my visitor had sprung across a  six-foot hedge!\"    \"It's absolutely mad,\" said Gatton gloomily. \"Far from helping us, it  only plunges us deeper in the mire.\"    We returned to the study, and:    \"You will have seen the daily papers?\" asked the Inspector.    I nodded.    \"Practically all of them. They give a hateful prominence to the name  of Miss Merlin.\"    \"And to that of the new baronet--Sir Eric,\" said Gatton significantly.    I stared at him straightly.    \"Do you seriously believe,\" said I, \"that Eric Coverly had anything  whatever to do with the death of his cousin?\"    Gatton stirred uneasily in his chair.    \"Well,\" he answered, \"ignoring everything else for the moment, who  else benefits by Sir Marcus Coverly's death?\"    It was a poser--a question which I had dreaded because I had known it  to be unanswerable.    \"He inherits the title,\" continued Gatton, \"and on the death of Lady  Burnham Coverly he inherits Friars' Park. There is some clause or  entail, or legal hotchpotch whereby the estate and revenue remain hers  during her lifetime.\"    \"But I understand the estate is mortgaged?\"    \"That I have to confirm, Mr. Addison,\" replied Gatton. \"Sir Eric's  solicitor has no information on the point and that of Sir Marcus's man  of business is inexact. But even supposing that only the title is  concerned, many a man has lost his life for less. Then you have to  consider--Miss Merlin.\"    \"In what way?\" I demanded    \"In relation to the attitude of Sir Marcus. Jealousy makes men (and  women) do strange and desperate things. The character of Eric Coverly,  the new baronet, is a very odd one.\"    \"He is headstrong and in some respects weak,\" I admitted. \"But  otherwise he is an ordinary English gentleman, with the traditions of  an old name and a public school to back him up. I tell you, Gatton,  it's nonsense. His army career alone shows him to be a sound man.\"    \"Yes,\" murmured Gatton; \"he was awarded a decoration for distinguished  service in Egypt.\"    That seemingly simple remark struck me with all the force of a  physical blow. Gatton began quietly to load his pipe, without even  glancing in my direction; but the covert significance of his words was  all too apparent:    \"Gatton,\" I said--\"what the devil are you driving at?\"    He slightly shrugged his shoulders.    \"What you may term the hocus-pocus side of the case,\" he replied,  \"turns on matters Egyptian, doesn't it? Very well. Who else, that we  know about, is associated, or ever has been associated with Egypt?\"    \"But--the woman?\"    \"Ah!\" said Gatton. \"Now you are getting down to the depths. But  assuming that the extraordinary characteristics of this visitor of  yours can be explained in some way, by deliberate trickery, for  example, might she not be a woman whom Eric Coverly met in Egypt?\"    I stared silently a while, and then:    \"In short, a rival of Miss Merlin's?\" I suggested.    \"Precisely. The trick with the photograph was just of the kind one  would expect from a madly jealous woman. Everything planned with  supreme cunning, but the scene at which the hated rival enters the  scheme badly overdone.\"    \"And you believe Coverly's silence to be due to the fact that he is  shielding some one?\"    \"Well, that or shielding himself. What else can it mean? A man  suspected of murder doesn't hesitate to establish an alibi unless he  is in a desperately tight corner. The exact position of your  strange-eyed acquaintance in the case is not apparent to me at the  moment, I'll admit, but I seem to have heard that there have been rare  instances of human beings with luminous eyes.\"    \"Quite right, Inspector,\" I agreed; \"I hope very shortly to have some  further particulars for you bearing upon this point. I am endeavoring  to obtain a work by Saint-Hilaire dealing with teratology.\"    \"As to her extraordinary activity and agility,\" Gatton continued, \"we  must remember that a privet hedge is not like a stone wall. I mean she  may not have actually cleared the whole six feet, and after all, this  is the age of the athletic girl. There are women athletes who can  perform some extraordinary feats of high-jumping. Of course, there are  still a number of witnesses to be"]]]
