Referable in the same way to the overburdening  of the vocal cords is the excessive straining of the throat muscles,  which, through continual constriction, lose their power of _elastic_  contraction and relaxation because pitch and duration of the tone are  gained in an incorrect way, by forcing. Neither should be forced;  pitch should be merely maintained, as it were, soaring; strength  should not be gained by a cramped compression of the throat muscles,  but by the completest possible filling with breath of the breath-form  and the resonance chambers, under the government of the controlling  apparatus.    _Neglect of the head tones (overtones) is paid for dearly._    The more violent exertions are made to force them, and to keep them,  the worse are the results. For most of the unhappy singers who do  this, there is but one result: the voice is lost. How pitiful!    If the first and second stages of tremolo are difficult to remedy,  because the causes are rarely understood and the proper measures to  take for their removal still more rarely, the repair of the last stage  of the damage is nothing less than a fight, in which only an  unspeakable patience can win the victory.          SECTION XXI    THE CURE      There are no magic cures for the singer. Only slowly, vibration upon  vibration, can the true pitch be won back. In the word \"soaring\" lies  the whole idea of the work. No more may the breath be allowed to flow  uncontrolled through the wearied vocal cords; it must be forced  against the chest, always, as if it were to come directly out thence.  The throat muscles must lie fallow until they have lost the habit of  cramped contraction; until the overtones again soar as they should,  and are kept soaring long, though quite _piano_. At first this seems  quite impossible, and is indeed very difficult, demanding all the  patient's energy. But it is possible, and he cannot avoid it, for it  is the only way to a thorough cure. The patient has an extremely  disagreeable period to pass through. If he is industrious and careful,  he will soon find it impossible to sing in his old way; but the new  way is for the most part quite unfamiliar to him, because his ear  still hears as it has previously been accustomed to hear. It may be  that years will pass before he can again use the muscles, so long  maltreated. But he should not be dismayed at this prospect. If he can  no longer use his voice in public as a singer, he certainly can as a  teacher--for _a teacher must be able to sing well_. How should he  describe to others sensations in singing which he himself never felt?  Is it not as if he undertook to teach a language that he did not speak  himself? or an instrument that he did not play himself? When he  himself does not hear, how shall he teach others to hear?    The degree of the evil, and the patient's skill, naturally have much  to do with the rapidity of the cure. But one cannot throw off a habit  of years' standing like an old garment; and every new garment, too, is  uncomfortable at first. One cannot expect an immediate cure, either of  himself or of others. If the singer undertakes it with courage and  energy, he learns to use his voice with conscious understanding, as  should have been done in the beginning.    And he must make up his mind to it, that even after a good cure, the  old habits will reappear, like corns in wet weather, whenever he is  not in good form physically. That should not lead to discouragement;  persistence will bring success.    As I have already said, singers with disabled voices like best to try  \"magic cures\"; and there are teachers and pupils who boast of having  effected such magic cures in a few weeks or hours.    _Of them I give warning!_ and _equally_, of unprincipled physicians  who daub around in the larynx, burn it, cut it, and make everything  worse instead of better.    I cannot comprehend why singers do not unite to brand such people  publicly and put an end to their doings once for all.    There is no other remedy than a slow, very careful study of the  _causes_ of the trouble, which in almost all cases consist in lack of  control of the stream of breath through the vocal cords, and in  disregard of the head tones, that is, of the overtones; as well as in  forcing the pitch and power of the tone upon a wrong resonating point  of the palate, and in constricting the throat muscles. In these points  almost invariably are all mistakes to be looked for; and in the  recognition of them the proper means for correcting them are already  indicated.    The cure is difficult and tedious. It needs an endless patience on the  part of the sufferer as well as of the physician--that is, of the  pupil and the _singing teacher_ (the only proper physician for this  disease)--because the nerves of the head are already sufficiently  unstrung through the consciousness of their incapacity; yet they  should be able to act easily and without effort in producing the head  tones.    The repairing of a voice requires the greatest sympathetic  appreciation and circumspection on the part of the teacher, who should  always inspire the pupil with courage; and on the part of the pupil,  all his tranquillity, nervous strength, and patience, in order to  reach the desired goal.    _Where there is a will there is a way!_          SECTION XXII    THE TONGUE      Since it is the function of the tongue to conduct the column of breath  above the larynx to the resonance chambers, too much attention cannot  be given to it and its position, in speaking as well as in singing. If  it lies too high or too low, it may, by constricting the breath,  produce serious changes in the tone, making it pinched or even  shutting it off entirely.    It has an extremely delicate and difficult task to perform. It must be  in such a position as not to press upon the larynx. Tongue and larynx  must keep out of each other's way, although they always work in  cooeperation; but one must not hamper the other, and when one can  withdraw no farther out of the way, the other must take it upon  itself to do so. For this reason the back of the tongue must be raised  high, the larynx stand low.    The tongue must generally form a furrow. With the lowest tones it lies  relatively flattest, the tip _always_ against and beneath the front  teeth, so that it can rise in the middle.    As soon as the furrow is formed, the mass of the tongue is put out of  the way, since it stands high on both sides. It is almost impossible  to make drawings of this; it can best be seen in the mirror. As soon  as the larynx is low enough and the tongue set elastically against the  palate and drawn up behind (see plate _a_), the furrow is formed of  itself. In pronouncing the vowel _ah_ (which must always be mixed with  _[=oo]_ and _o_), it is a good idea to think of yawning.    The furrow must be formed in order to allow the breath to resonate  against the palate beneath the nose, especially in the middle range;  that is, what a bass and a baritone (whose highest range is not now  under consideration) would call their high range, all other voices  their middle.    Without the furrow in the tongue, no tone is perfect in its resonance,  none can make full use of it. The only exception is the very highest  head and falsetto tones, which are without any palatal resonance and  have their place solely in the head cavities. Strong and yet delicate,  it must be able to fit any letter of the alphabet; that is, help form  its sound. It must be of the greatest sensitiveness in adapting itself  to every tonal vibration, it must assist every change of tone and  letter as quick as a flash and with unerring accuracy; without  changing its position too soon or remaining too long in it, in the  highest range it must be able almost to speak out in the air.    With all its strength and firmness this furrow must be of the utmost  sensitiveness toward the breath, which, as I have often said, must not  be subjected to the least pressure above the larynx or in the larynx  itself. Pressure must be limited to the abdominal and chest muscles;  and this might better be called stress than pressure.    Without hindrance the column of breath, at its upper end like  diverging rays of light, must fill and expand all the mucous membranes  with its vibrations equally, diffuse itself through the resonance  chambers and penetrate the cavities of the head.    When the back of the tongue can rise no higher, the larynx must be  lowered. This often happens in the highest ranges, and one needs only  to mingle an _oo_ in the vowel to be sung, which must, however, be  sounded not forward in the mouth but _behind the nose_. When the  larynx must stand very low, the tongue naturally must not be _too_  high, else it would affect the position of the larynx. The mass of the  tongue must then be disposed of elsewhere; that is, by the formation  of a furrow (see plate). One must learn to feel and hear it. To keep  the larynx, the back of the tongue, and the palate always in  readiness to offer mutual assistance, must become a habit. I feel the  interplay of tongue and larynx in my own case as shown in the plates.    As soon as we have the tongue under control,--that is, have acquired  the habit of forming a furrow,--we can use it confidently as a support  for the breath and the tone, and for vowels.    On its incurving back it holds firmly the vowels; with its tip, many  of the consonants. With all its elasticity, it must be trained to  great strength and endurance.    I, for instance, after every syllable, at once jerk my tongue with  tremendous power back to its normal position in singing; that is, with  its tip below the front teeth and the base raised [Illustration]. That  goes on constantly, as quick as a flash. At the same time my larynx  takes such a position that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#12)"],[1," the previous exercises; this will insure largeness with proper  resonance.    When practising this exercise, be careful, as with the others, that  each vowel sound in its order is correctly given before passing to the  next. Only in this way can rapid progress be made.    The words _bing_, _sing_, _ting_, _fling_, _swing_ are excellent to  use for further practice.    [Music illustration:    1. Hung-ee  2. Hung-oo  3. Hung-oh  4. Hung-aw  5. Hung-ah    _etc._]    [Music illustration:    1. Hung-ee  2. Hung-oo  3. Hung-oh  4. Hung-aw  5. Hung-ah    _etc._]      Exercise IX    QUICK CHANGING NOTES WITHOUT CHANGING RESONANCE    The important point in this flexible exercise is to _keep the  vowel-color, the focus or resonance, unchanged throughout the phrase_.  Begin quietly, give the _ng_ freedom and the upper resonance will  adjust itself. This phrase is longer than in previous exercises; be  sure then that you still have breath at the end--breath enough to sing  further. Sing quietly. Pitch the exercise to suit the voice.    [Music illustration:    1. Hung-ee  2. Hung-oo  3. Hung-oh  4. Hung-aw  5. Hung-ah    _etc._]      Exercise X    FOR AGILITY    Sing each vowel sound separately before passing to the next. Be sure  to start each vowel sound in purity and maintain it without change.  Pitch the exercise to suit the voice.    [Music illustration:    1. Ee  2. Oo  3. Oh  4. Aw  5. Ah    _etc._]    For variants on the above use as initial consonants _b_, _p_, _m_,  _f_, _v_, _d_, _k_, _n_, _t_, and _l_.      Exercise XI    TO DEVELOP THE USE OF THE LIPS AND UNDER JAW    When practising this exercise protrude the lips and raise them toward  the nose as far as possible; also make an effort to enlarge and widen  the nostrils. This exercise may be practised more quickly than the  preceding, but never at the expense of clearness of vowel distinction.  Carry the exercise higher or lower, and in different keys, to suit  individual voices. With a slight initial accent sing each two-measure  section smoothly as one phrase. Avoid accenting each separate vowel  sound. To do so would produce a series of jerks.    [Music illustration: Ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]    After practising the above as written modify it as follows:     1. Bee-boo-boh-baw-bah.   2. Pee-poo-poh-paw-pah.   3. Mee-moo-moh-maw-mah.   4. Fee-foo-foh-faw-fah.   5. Vee-voo-voh-vaw-vah.   6. Dee-doo-doh-daw-dah.   7. Kee-koo-koh-kaw-kah.   8. Nee-noo-noh-naw-nah.   9. Tee-too-toh-taw-tah.  10. Lee-loo-loh-law-lah.      Exercise XII    FOR FACILITY AND QUICK VOWEL CHANGE    Be careful not to blur the vowel sounds; each must be distinct and  pure, and the change from one to the next must be made with a minimum  of effort and without disturbing the focus of the tone.    [Music illustration: Ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]    The divisions (_a_ and _b_) of each of the above four variants may be  regarded as distinct exercises or not. For further practice use as  initial consonants any or all of the following: _b_, _p_, _m_, _f_,  _v_, _d_, _k_, _n_, _t_, and _l_.      Exercise XIII    ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE    As in the previous exercises practise quietly with unvarying focus and  aim to finish the phrase with breath unexhausted. Pitch the exercise  to suit the voice.    [Music illustration:    Hung-ee  Hung-oo  Hung-oh  Hung-aw  Hung-ah    _etc._]      Exercise XIV    THE LONG SCALE    Sing this scale exercise in medium range, without blurring either the  vowel sounds or the notes.    [Music illustration:    1. Hung-ee  2. Hung-oo  3. Hung-oh  4. Hung-aw  5. Hung-ah    _etc._]    [Music illustration:    1. Hung-ee  2. Hung-oo  3. Hung-oh  4. Hung-aw  5. Hung-ah    _etc._]    The exercises thus far given have employed the five vowel sounds found  most helpful in gaining a free resonance. These should now be  supplemented by the use of _all_ the vowel sounds. It is obvious that  unless the singer is at home with every vowel and on any pitch in his  vocal range perfect pronunciation is impossible. In Chapter II a Scale  of Vowel Sounds is given. For convenience it is repeated here:    [Illustration:    1  n_ee_  2  n_i_t  3  n_e_t  4  n_a_y  5  n_ai_r  6  n_a_t  7  n_i_gh  8  N_a_h  7' n_o_t  6' n_a_w  5' n_e_r  4' n_u_t  3' n_o_  2' n_oo_k  1' n_oo_.]    Having so far mastered the previous exercises as to establish a free  head and nasal resonance, take the Scale of Vowel Sounds and apply it  to the now familiar exercises.    Next, as suggested in Exercise X, use as initial consonants in  connection with the Vowel Scale the consonants _b_, _p_, _m_, _f_,  _v_, _d_, _k_, _n_, _t_ and _l_.    Keep before you the formula that articulation should _seem_ to be done  entirely with and through the upper lip; _i.e._, the _thought_ should  be that the words are projected through the upper lip.    When by practise of the exercises given the voice has been focused and  resonance established without any instrument, scale exercises and  simple vocalises may be taken up with or without the piano.    In practising scales start each a semitone higher until the _easy  limit_ of the voice is reached, and no farther. Gain will be more  rapid by working to deliver the tones within the voice's normal  compass. Then when occasional effort is made the organs will be found  ready to deliver the highest pitch of which the voice is capable.    When sufficient progress has been made in mastering the execution of  scales and easy vocalises, the pupil will be ready to begin the study  of songs. If one foregoes the singing of songs during the few weeks  occupied with primary lessons, results are obtained much more quickly.    While practising exercises or songs the less the pianoforte is used,  except to compare the pitch, the better. Such practice increases the  confidence of the performer. The instrument prevents the singer's  listening to the tone he is producing and judging of its  effectiveness.    Pupils with high or very low voices may continue their practice higher  or lower as the voice is soprano, or bass, or contralto, but much  practice on the extremes of the voice is unadvisable. If pure tones  are produced in the medium range of the voice the highest or lowest  tones will be found ready when called for. Therefore practise the  extremes of the voice only enough to know the limits of the voice and  to be assured the tones are there.    When the singer can perform the preceding simple exercises and know  that the tones are all focused, or placed and delivered, precisely  alike, he is ready to practise any scale, down or up, and to execute  any musical exercise or song for which he is intellectually fitted.          CHAPTER IX    THROAT STIFFNESS      What is the most frequent obstacle to good singing, the difficulty  with which pupil and teacher most contend? Throat stiffness. What more  than anything else mars the singing of those we hear in drawing-rooms,  churches, and the concert room? Throat stiffness.    This is the vice that prevents true intonation, robs the voice of its  expressiveness, limits its range, lessens its flexibility, diminishes  its volume, and makes true resonance impossible.    This great interferer not only lessens the beauty of any voice, but  directly affects the organ itself. The muscles of the larynx are small  and delicate, and the adjustments they make in singing are exceedingly  fine. When, however, the voice user stiffens his throat, these  delicate muscles in their spontaneous effort to make the proper  adjustments are compelled to contract with more than their normal  strength. Every increase in throat stiffness demands a corresponding  increase in muscle effort, an overexertion that persisted in must  result in injury to the organ itself. Such misuse of the voice is  bound to show injurious results. Every throat specialist knows this,  and an untold multitude of those who, beginning with promise, have had  to give up singing as a career, learn it too late.    Singers are so accustomed to the sound of their own voices as to be  usually quite unconscious of their own throat stiffness, though they  may recognize it in their neighbor.    Unfortunately throat stiffness by its very nature tends to aggravate  itself, to constantly increase while the voice becomes less and less  responsive to the singer's demands.    There are a number of contributing causes to throat stiffness, but the  principal cause is _throat consciousness_ and misplaced effort, due  largely to current misconceptions regarding the voice. A common notion  is that we sing with the throat, whereas we sing _through_ it. Akin to  this error is the notion, as common as it is fallacious, that force of  tone, carrying power, originates in the larynx, whereas the initial  tone due to the vibration of the vocal cords is in itself  comparatively feeble. As shown at length in Chapters VI and VII,  volume of tone, its color and carrying power, is acoustically and  vocally a matter of _resonance_.    Many there are who sing by dint of sheer force and ignorance, but  their careers are necessarily short. The too common vulgar striving  for power rather than for beauty or purity of tone induces unnatural  effort and strain that both directly and sympathetically affect the  throat with stiffness.    Unnatural effort in breathing, over-effort in breath control, as well  as singing without adequate breath, all induce tension that is  reflected at once in the sensitive throat.    Impatience of results, American hurry, beget unnatural effort and  tension. \"Unclasp the fingers of a rigid civilization from off your  throat.\" The student of the violin or the piano soon learns that only  by a long and patient preparation can he fit himself to entertain even  his admiring friends. The embryo singer, on the contrary, expects with  far less expenditure of time and effort to appear in public.    The human voice is a direct expression of the man himself; it  registers spontaneously his mental and emotional states,"]]]
