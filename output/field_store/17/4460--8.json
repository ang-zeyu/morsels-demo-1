If 'man,' for example, has among mammals  the two peculiar attributes of erect gait and articulate speech, then,  by omitting 'articulate speech' from the connotation of man, we could  not apply the name to any more of the existing mammalia than we can at  present. Still we might have been able to do so; there might have been  an erect inarticulate ape, and perhaps there once was one; and, if so,  to omit 'articulate' from the connotation of man would make the term  'man' denote that animal (supposing that there was no other difference  to exclude it). Hence, potentially, an increase of the connotation of  any term implies a decrease of its denotation. And, on the other hand,  we can only increase the denotation of a term, or apply it to more  objects, by decreasing its connotation; for, if the new things denoted  by the term had already possessed its whole connotation, they must  already have been denoted by it. However, we may increase the _known_  denotation without decreasing the connotation, if we can discover the  full connotation in things not formerly supposed to have it, as when  dolphins were discovered to be mammals; or if we can impose the  requisite qualities upon new individuals, as when by annexing some  millions of Africans we extend the denotation of 'British subject'  without altering its connotation.    Many of the things noticed in this chapter, especially in this section  and the preceding, will be discussed at greater length in the chapters  on Classification and Definition.    Sec. 7. Contradictory Relative Terms.--Every term has, or may have, another  corresponding with it in such a way that, whatever differential  qualities (Sec. 5) it connotes, this other connotes merely their absence;  so that one or the other is always formally predicable of any Subject,  but both these terms are never predicable of the same Subject in the  same relation: such pairs of terms are called Contradictories. Whatever  Subject we take, it is either visible or invisible, but not both; either  human or non-human, but not both.    This at least is true formally, though in practice we should think  ourselves trifled with if any one told us that 'A mountain is either  human or non-human, but not both.' It is symbolic terms, such as X and  x, that are properly said to be contradictories in relation to any  subject whatever, S or M. For, as we have seen, the ordinary use of  terms is limited by some _suppositio_, and this is true of  Contradictories. 'Human' and 'non-human' may refer to zoological  classification, or to the scope of physical, mental, or moral powers--as  if we ask whether to flourish a dumbbell of a ton weight, or to know the  future by intuition, or impeccability, be human or non-human. Similarly,  'visible' and 'invisible' refer either to the power of emitting or  reflecting light, so that the words have no hold upon a sound or a  scent, or else to power of vision and such qualifications as 'with the  naked eye' or 'with a microscope.'    Again, the above definition of Contradictories tells us that they cannot  be predicated of the same Subject \"in the same relation\"; that is, at  the same time or place, or under the same conditions. The lamp is  visible to me now, but will be invisible if I turn it out; one side of  it is now visible, but the other is not: therefore without this  restriction, \"in the same relation,\" few or no terms would be  contradictory.    If a man is called wise, it may mean 'on the whole' or 'in a certain  action'; and clearly a man may for once be wise (or act wisely) who, on  the whole, is not-wise. So that here again, by this ambiguity, terms  that seem contradictory are predicable of the same subject, but not \"in  the same relation.\" In order to avoid the ambiguity, however, we have  only to construct the term so as to express the relation, as 'wise on  the whole'; and this immediately generates the contradictory 'not-wise  on the whole.' Similarly, at one age a man may have black hair, at  another not-black hair; but the difficulty is practically removable by  stating the age referred to.    Still, this case easily leads us to a real difficulty in the use of  contradictory terms, a difficulty arising from the continuous change or  'flux' of natural phenomena. If things are continually changing, it may  be urged that contradictory terms are always applicable to the same  subject, at least as fast as we can utter them: for if we have just said  that a man's hair is black, since (like everything else) his hair is  changing, it must now be not-black, though (to be sure) it may still  seem black. The difficulty, such as it is, lies in this, that the human  mind and its instrument language are not equal to the subtlety of  Nature. All things flow, but the terms of human discourse assume a  certain fixity of things; everything at every moment changes, but for  the most part we can neither perceive this change nor express it in  ordinary language.    This paradox, however, may, I suppose, be easily over-stated. The change  that continually agitates Nature consists in the movements of masses or  molecules, and such movements of things are compatible with a  considerable persistence of their qualities. Not only are the molecular  changes always going on in a piece of gold compatible with its remaining  yellow, but its persistent yellowness depends on the continuance of some  of those changes. Similarly, a man's hair may remain black for some  years; though, no doubt, at a certain age its colour may begin to be  problematical, and the applicability to it of 'black' or 'not-black' may  become a matter of genuine anxiety. Whilst being on our guard, then,  against fallacies of contradiction arising from the imperfect  correspondence of fact with thought and language, we shall often have to  put up with it. Candour and humility having been satisfied by the above  acknowledgment of the subtlety of Nature, we may henceforward proceed  upon the postulate--that it is possible to use contradictory terms such  as cannot both be predicated of the same subject in the same relation,  though one of them may be; that, for example, it may be truly said of a  man for some years that his hair is black; and, if so, that during those  years to call it not-black is false or extremely misleading.    The most opposed terms of the literary vocabulary, however, such as  'wise-foolish,' 'old-young,' 'sweet-bitter,' are rarely true  contradictories: wise and foolish, indeed, cannot be predicated of the  same man in the same relation; but there are many middling men, of whom  neither can be predicated on the whole. For the comparison of  quantities, again, we have three correlative terms,  'greater--equal--less,' and none of these is the contradictory of either  of the others. In fact, the contradictory of any term is one that  denotes the sum of its co-ordinates (Sec. 6); and to obtain a  contradictory, the surest way is to coin one by prefixing to the given  term the particle 'not' or (sometimes) 'non': as 'wise, not-wise,'  'human, non-human,' 'greater, not-greater.'    The separate word 'not' is surer to constitute a contradictory than the  usual prefixes of negation, 'un-' or 'in-,' or even 'non'; since  compounds of these are generally warped by common use from a purely  negative meaning. Thus, 'Nonconformist' does not denote everybody who  fails to conform. 'Unwise' is not equivalent to 'not-wise,' but means  'rather foolish'; a very foolish action is not-wise, but can only be  called unwise by meiosis or irony. Still, negatives formed by 'in' or  'un' or 'non' are sometimes really contradictory of their positives; as  'visible, invisible,' 'equal, unequal.'    Sec. 8. The distinction between Positive and Negative terms is not of much  value in Logic, what importance would else attach to it being absorbed  by the more definite distinction of contradictories. For contradictories  are positive and negative in essence and, when least ambiguously stated,  also in form. And, on the other hand, as we have seen, when positive and  negative terms are not contradictory, they are misleading. As with  'wise-unwise,' so with many others, such as 'happy-unhappy'; which are  not contradictories; since a man may be neither happy nor unhappy, but  indifferent, or (again) so miserable that he can only be called unhappy  by a figure of speech. In fact, in the common vocabulary a formal  negative often has a limited positive sense; and this is the case with  unhappy, signifying the state of feeling in the milder shades of  Purgatory.    When a Negative term is fully contradictory of its Positive it is said  to be Infinite; because it denotes an unascertained multitude of things,  a multitude only limited by the positive term and the _suppositio_; thus  'not-wise' denotes all except the wise, within the _suppositio_ of  'intelligent beings.' Formally (disregarding any _suppositio_), such a  negative term stands for all possible terms except its positive: x  denotes everything but X; and 'not-wise' may be taken to include stones,  triangles and hippogriffs. And even in this sense, a negative term has  some positive meaning, though a very indefinite one, not a specific  positive force like 'unwise' or 'unhappy': it denotes any and everything  that has not the attributes connoted by the corresponding positive term.    Privative Terms connote the absence of a quality that normally belongs  to the kind of thing denoted, as 'blind' or 'deaf.' We may predicate  'blind' or 'deaf' of a man, dog or cow that happens not to be able to  see"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#12)"],[1," bull excommunicating him, which he burnt openly  before a sympathetic multitude in Wittenberg. His life was a stormy one,  and he was more than once in mortal danger by reason of his antagonism  to the papal authority, but he found powerful patrons, and lived to see  the Reformation an organized fact. He died in his birthplace, Eisleben,  Feb. 18th, 1546.    The translation of the \"Ein feste burg,\" given above, in part, is by  Rev. Frederick Henry Hedge, D.D., born in Cambridge, March 1805, a  graduate of Harvard, and formerly minister of the Unitarian Church in  Bangor, Me. Died, 1890.    Luther wrote thirty-six hymns, to some of which he fitted his own music,  for he was a musician and singer as well as an eloquent preacher. The  tune in which \"Ein feste Burg\" is sung in the hymnals, was composed by  himself. The hymn has also a noble rendering in the music of Sebastian  Bach, 8-4 time, found in _Hymns Ancient and Modern_.      BARTHOLOMEW RINGWALDT.    \"Great God, What Do I See and Hear?\"    The history of this hymn is somewhat indefinite, though common consent  now attributes to Ringwaldt the stanza beginning with the above line.  The imitation of the \"Dies Irae\" in German which was first in use was  printed in Jacob Klug's \"_Gesangbuch_\" in 1535. Ringwaldt's hymn of the  Last Day, also inspired from the ancient Latin original, appears in his  _Handbuchlin_ of 1586, but does not contain this stanza. The first line  is, \"The awful Day will surely come,\" (Es ist gewisslich an der Zeit).  Nevertheless through the more than two hundred years that the hymn has  been translated and re-translated, and gone through inevitable  revisions, some vital identity in the spirit and tone of the one  seven-line stanza has steadily connected it with Ringwaldt's name.  Apparently it is the single survivor of a great lost hymn--edited and  altered out of recognition. But its power evidently inspired the added  verses, as we have them. Dr. Collyer found it, and, regretting that it  was too short to sing in public service, composed stanzas 2d, 3d and  4th. It is likely that Collyer first met with it in _Psalms and Hymns  for Public and Private Devotion_, Sheffield 1802, where it appeared  anonymously. So far as known this was its first publication in English.  Ringwaldt's stanza and two of Collyer's are here given:        Great God, what do I see and hear!        The end of things created!      The Judge of mankind doth appear        On clouds of glory seated.      The trumpet sounds, the graves restore      The dead which they contained before;        Prepare, my soul, to meet Him.        The dead in Christ shall first arise        At the last trumpet sounding,      Caught up to meet Him in the skies,        With joy their Lord surrounding.      No gloomy fears their souls dismay      His presence sheds eternal day        On those prepared to meet Him.        Far over space to distant spheres        The lightnings are prevailing      Th' ungodly rise, and all their tears        And sighs are unavailing.      The day of grace is past and gone;      They shake before the Judge's Throne        All unprepared to meet Him.    Bartholomew Ringwaldt, pastor of the Lutheran Church of Longfeld,  Prussia, was born in 1531, and died in 1599. His hymns appear in a  collection entitled _Hymns for the Sundays and Festivals of the Whole  Year_.    Rev. William Bengo Collyer D.D., was born at Blackheath near London,  April 14, 1782, educated at Homerton College and settled over a  Congregational Church in Peckham. In 1812 he published a book of hymns,  and in 1837 a _Service Book_ to which he contributed eighty-nine hymns.  He died Jan, 9, 1854.      _THE TUNE._    Probably it was the customary singing of Ringwaldt's hymn (in Germany)  to Luther's tune that gave it for some time the designation of \"Luther's  Hymn,\" the title by which the music is still known--an air either  composed or adapted by Luther, and rendered perhaps unisonously or with  extempore chords. It was not until early in the last century that  Vincent Novello wrote to it the noble arrangement now in use. It is a  strong, even-time harmony with lofty tenor range, and very impressive  with full choir and organ or the vocal volume of a congregation. In  _Cheetham's Psalmody_ is it written with a trumpet obligato.    Vincent Novello, born in London, Sept. 6, 1781, the intimate friend of  Lamb, Shelley, Keats, Hunt and Hazlitt, was a professor of music who  attained great eminence as an organist and composer of hymn-tunes and  sacred pieces. He was the founder of the publishing house of Novello and  Ewer, and father of a famous musical family. Died at Nice, Aug. 9, 1861.      ST. FRANCIS XAVIER.    \"_O Deus, Ego Amo Te._\"    Francis Xavier, the celebrated Jesuit missionary, called \"The Apostle of  the Indies,\" was a Spaniard, born in 1506. While a student in Paris he  met Ignatius Loyola, and joined him in the formation of the new \"Society  for the Propagation of the Faith.\" He was sent out on a mission to the  East Indies and Japan, and gave himself to the work with a martyr's  devotion. The stations he established in Japan were maintained more than  a hundred years. He died in China, Dec. 1552.    His hymn, some time out of use, is being revived in later singing-books  as expressive of the purest and highest Christian sentiment:            O Deus, ego amo Te.          Nec amo Te, ut salves me,          Aut quia non amantes Te          AEterno punis igne.        My God, I love Thee--not because        I hope for heaven thereby;      Nor yet because who love Thee not        Must burn eternally.    After recounting Christ's vicarious sufferings as the chief claim to His  disciples' unselfish love, the hymn continues,--            Cur igitur non amem Te,          O Jesu amantissime!          Non, ut in coelo salves me,          Aut in aeternum damnes me.        Then why, O blessed Jesus Christ,        Should I not love Thee well?      Not for the sake of winning heaven,        Nor of escaping hell;        Not with the hope of gaining aught,        Nor seeking a reward,      But as Thyself hast loved me,        Oh, ever-loving Lord!        E'en so I love Thee, and will love,        And in Thy praise will sing;      Solely because Thou art my God        And my eternal King.    The translation is by Rev. Edward Caswall, 1814-1878, a priest in the  Church of Rome. Besides his translations, he published the _Lyra  Catholica_, the _Masque of Mary_, and several other poetical works.  (Page 101.)      _THE TUNE._    \"St. Bernard\"--apparently so named because originally composed to  Caswall's translation of one of Bernard of Clairvaux's hymns--is by  John Richardson, born in Preston, Eng., Dec. 4, 1817, and died there  April 13, 1879. He was an organist in Liverpool, and noted as a composer  of glees, but was the author of several sacred tunes.      SIR WALTER RALEIGH.    \"Give Me My Scallop-Shell of Quiet.\"    Few of the hymns of the Elizabethan era survive, though the Ambrosian  Midnight Hymn, \"Hark, 'tis the Midnight Cry,\" and the hymns of St.  Bernard and Bernard of Cluny, are still tones in the church, and the  religious poetry of Sir Walter Raleigh comes down to us associated with  the history of his brilliant, though tragic career. The following poem  has some fine lines in the quaint English style of the period, and was  composed by Sir Walter during his first imprisonment:        Give me my scallop-shell of quiet,        My staff of faith to walk upon,      My scrip of joy--immortal diet--        My bottle of salvation,      My gown of glory, hope's true gage--      And thus I take my pilgrimage.        Blood must be my body's balmer,      While my soul, like faithful palmer,      Travelleth toward the land of heaven;      Other balm will not be given.        Over the silver mountains      Where spring the nectar fountains,      There will I kiss the bowl of bliss,      And drink my everlasting fill,      Upon every milken hill;      My soul will be a-dry before,      But after that will thirst no more.    The musings of the unfortunate but high-souled nobleman in expectation  of ignominious death are interesting and pathetic, but they have no  claim to a tune, even if they were less rugged and unmetrical. But the  poem stands notable among the pious witnesses.      MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.    \"_O Domine Deus, Speravi in Te._\"    This last passionate prayer of the unhappy Mary Stuart just before her  execution--in a language which perhaps flowed from her pen more easily  than even her English or French--is another witness of supplicating  faith that struggles out of darkness with a song. In her extremity the  devoted Catholic forgets her petitions to the Virgin, and comes to  Christ:            O Domine Deus, Speravi in Te;          O care mi Jesu, nunc libera me!      In dura catena, in misera poena            Desidero Te!      Languendo, gemendo, et genuflectendo      Adoro, imploro ut liberes me!        My Lord and my God! I have trusted in Thee;      O Jesus, my Saviour belov'd, set me free:      In rigorous chains, in piteous pains,          I am longing for Thee!      In weakness appealing, in agony kneeling,      I pray, I beseech Thee, O Lord, set me free!    One would, at first thought, judge this simple but eloquent cry worthy  of an appropriate tone-expression--to be sung by prison evangelists like  the Volunteers of America, to convicts in the jails and penitentiaries.  But its special errand and burden are voiced so literally that hardened  hearers would probably misapply it--however sincerely the petitioner  herself meant to invoke spiritual rather than temporal deliverance. The  hymn, if we may call it so, is _too_ literal. Possibly at some time or  other it may have been set to music but not for ordinary choir service.      SAMUEL RUTHERFORD.
