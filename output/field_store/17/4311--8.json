Work first the middle  row of the cravat at the same time with the row of circles on the left  side of the middle row in illustration; begin with the first circle of  the middle row. It consists of 7 times alternately 3 double, 1 small  purl, then 3 double. Work close to this circle, which must be turned  downwards, a Josephine knot, consisting of 5 plain stitches, then a  circle consisting of 5 double, 1 purl one-fifth of an inch long, 5 times  alternately 3 double, 1 small purl; 3 double, 1 long purl, 5 double.  *Turn this circle (which is the first of the side row) downwards, work  close to it a Josephine knot, then a circle consisting of 12 double, 1  small purl, 12 double. Turn this circle downwards, work a Josephine  knot, and then again a circle like the first of the side row, but  instead of working the first long purl, fasten it on to the last purl of  the preceding circle of the same row. Then hold the work so that the  circles of the side row are turned downwards, work a Josephine knot, 1  circle like the first circle of the middle row, turn the work, make 1  Josephine knot, and then a circle like the second circle of the side  row. Repeat from * till the cravat is sufficiently long. The last circle  of the middle row must correspond to the first circle of the same row.  Then begin to work the lower edge at the same time with the last circle  of the middle row, * 1 Josephine knot, then a circle like the circles of  the side row, again 1 Josephine knot, fastened on to the next purl of  the last circle of the middle row; repeat 3 times more from *. Then  continue as before, and work on the right side of the middle row a row  of circles exactly like those which have been worked at the same time  with those of the middle row.    The fastening on of the cotton between two Josephine knots is seen in  illustration. The circles at the other end of the cravat are fastened  like those of the first-described end. The cravat is edged all round  with a row of circles with Josephine knots worked exactly like those of  the preceding row, and the manner of fastening which is seen in the  illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    63.--_Rosette in Tatting and Embroidery_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 60, or 40  if required larger; tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 63.--Rosette in Tatting and Embroidery.]    The centre of this rosette is worked in lace stitch on muslin, edged  round with button-hole stitch and trimmed with a tatted lace, which is  worked at the same time with the centre. Work first * a small circle  consisting of 5 double, 1 purl, 3 double, fastened on to the button-hole  stitch edging of the rosette, then 3 double, 1 purl, 5 double. Then turn  the just-completed circle downwards, and afterwards work at a short  distance a large circle consisting of 7 double, 6 times alternately 1  purl, 2 double, lastly 1 purl, 7 double, then 1 Josephine knot  consisting of 7 plain. Then turn the work again, so that the last large  circle is turned downwards, and repeat from * 12 times more; the large  and small circles must be fastened on to one another, as seen in  illustration. The fastening of the small circles on to the centre is  likewise done from the illustration.    64.--_Cravat End in Tatting and Darned Netting_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 50;  tatting-pin No. 3; square of netting; fine Mecklenburg thread No. 80.    [Illustration: 64.--Cravat End in Tatting and Darned Netting.]    The end of this cravat is ornamented with a square of darned netting,  edged with a tatted border, and sewn on to the material of the cravat.  But the diamond in tatting (page 18), or the square (page 31) will look  very pretty with this border. The square is worked in diamond netting,  and has seven holes in length and breadth. They are darned in linen  stitch, darning stitch, and _point d'esprit_, with Mecklenburg thread.  The ground is worked over a mesh measuring three-tenths of an inch  round. For each square one more row than is needed must be worked, and  the cast-on stitches are cut off, as they are longer than the stitches  of the other rows. The tatted border is worked with fine tatting cotton.  Fasten the cotton at one corner of the square and work * a circle  consisting of 7 double, 1 purl, then six times alternately 2 double, 1  purl, 7 double, fasten the cotton on to the same stitch of the ground  where it was first fastened; #work a second circle like the  first, but fasten it, instead of working the first purl on to the last  purl of the preceding circle; fasten the cotton again on to the same  stitch, then on to the next stitch, and work a small circle, consisting  of 5 double fastened on to the last purl of the preceding circle, 4  double, 1 purl, 5 double. The cotton is fastened on to the same netted  stitch as before, and then on to the next stitch; repeat twice more from  #, and then repeat from * in all three times more, so that the  square is edged all round. It is sewn into the material from the  illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    65.--_Tatted Antimacassar. (See pages_ 574-5.)    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s Boar's Head cotton No. 30, or  tatting cotton No. 24, or for a larger size tatting cotton No. 20;  tatting-pin No. 1; large shuttle.    The illustration shows the fourth of the antimacassar and the whole of  the rosette which forms the centre. Begin with the latter, with the  five-branched pattern in the centre, at the same time with the following  round of circles:--*Work first one circle of this round, consisting of 3  double, 1 purl, 4 times alternately 2 double, 1 purl, 3 double; then at  a short distance a circle like the one just made, in which, however,  instead of working the first purl, the cotton must be joined on to the  last purl of the preceding circle. Then work at a short distance the  first leaf of the five-branched pattern, which consists of 4 double, 1  purl, 4 double. When this branch is completed, repeat at a short  distance 4 times more from *; but in working the branches of the  five-branched pattern, instead of working the purl, join it on to the  purl of the first branch of the five-branched pattern (this purl forms  the centre of the pattern). All the circles must also be joined one to  each other, as can be seen from illustration. Then work the scallops  round the border of the rosette, * fasten the cotton on to the purl  which joins the two next circles of the preceding round, and work one  scallop consisting of 11 times alternately 2 double, 1 purl, then 2  double. Repeat 9 times more from *. When the rosette is completed, work  eight rosettes in the same manner and join them into a circle from  illustration by means of small three-branched patterns, and then join  them on to the middle rosette.    The strip of insertion which comes next is worked in two halves as  follows:--Work first, for the half turned towards the centre, two rows  of circles lying opposite each other; begin with one of the largest  circles, consisting of 4 double, 1 purl, 3 times alternately 2 double, 1  purl, then 4 double; * at a short distance work a smaller circle of 4  double, 1 purl, 4 double; after another short distance, a circle like  the first joined on to it; then again a smaller circle, which at the  place of the first purl is joined on to the purl of the preceding small  circle. A short distance from this work again one of the larger circles  just described, which is fastened on to the preceding similar circle;  then repeat from * till the double row has nine larger and eight smaller  circles. The first half of the strip of insertion is completed; the  second outer half is worked like the first, only the small circles must  here be worked without any purl, and two of them together must always be  fastened on to the two joined small circles of the first half, as was  done for the five-branched pattern of the rosette; besides this, each of  the large circles has 4 double, 1 purl, 4 times alternately 2 double, 1  purl, then 4 double. When eight similar patterns have been worked, join  them into a circle from illustration by means of small rosettes; this  circle is then joined to the already-finished part of the cover. The  small rosettes and remaining patterns of the antimacassar are easily  worked from illustration. The completed patterns are joined together in  the course of the work.           *       *       *       *       *    TATTING COTTON    Is supplied by Messrs.

In order to determine  this, I asked all the subjects before they made the real experiment to  distribute 24 other cards in 4 piles, on each of which one of the four  letters, A, E, O, and U was printed only once. Hence no comparison of  various factors was involved in this form of distribution. The average  time for this ordinary sorting was about 20 seconds. Only rather quick  individuals carried it out in less than 18 and only very slow ones  needed more than 25 seconds. This maximum variation of 10 seconds is  evidently insignificant, as the variations in the experiment amount to  more than 200 seconds. But it is very characteristic that the results  of the two experiments do not move parallel. Some persons, who are  able to sort the cards on which only one of the 4 letters is printed  very quickly, are rather slow when they sort the cards with the 48  letters for which the essential factor is the act of comparison. In  the first case the training in card-playing also seems to have a  certain influence, but in the second case, our real experiment on  decision, this influence does not seem to exist.    We have emphasized from the start that it is no less important to give  consideration to the number of mistakes. A mere rapidity of  distribution with many mistakes characterizes, as we saw, a mental  system which is just as unfit for practical purposes as one which acts  with too great slowness. But it would not have been sufficient simply  to ask how many cards were put into wrong piles. The special  arrangement of the cards with four different types of combinations was  introduced for the purpose of discriminating among mistakes of unequal  seriousness. When one letter appeared 21 times and the three others  only 9 times, it was surely much easier to make the decision than when  the predominant letter appeared only 15 times and the other three each  11 times. The easier the right decision, the graver the mistake. Of  course the valuation of these mistakes must be rather arbitrary. We  decided to value as 4 every mistake in these cards on which the  predominant letter appears 21 times; as 3, a mistake in the 18 letter  cards; as 2, a mistake in the 16 letter cards; and as 1, a mistake in  the most difficult ones, the 15 letter cards. If the mistakes are  calculated on this basis and are added together, a sum below 5 may  indicate a very safe and perfectly reliable ability for decision; 5 to  12, satisfactory; 12 to 20, uncertain; and over 20, very poor. In  order to take account of both factors, time and mistakes, we multiply  the sum of the calculated mistakes by the number of seconds. If the  product of these two figures is less than 400, it may be taken as a  sign of perfect reliability in making very quick, correct decisions,  in complex life situations; 400 to 1000 indicates the limits between  which the ability for such decisions may be considered as normal and  very satisfactory; 1000 to 2000, not good but still adequate; 2000 to  3000, unreliable, and over 3000, practically absent. It is clear that  the real proof of the value of this method cannot be offered. This is  just the reason why we selected this illustration as an example of the  particular difficulty. Wrong decisions, that is, cases in which the  man on the bridge waits too long before he makes his decision and thus  causes a collision of ships by his delay, or in which he rushes  blindly to a decision which he himself would have condemned after  quiet deliberation, are rare. It would be impossible to group such  men together for the purpose of the experiment and to compare their  results with those of model captains, the more as experience has shown  that an officer may have a stainless record for many years and yet may  finally make a wrong decision which shows his faulty disposition. The  test of the method must therefore be a somewhat indirect one. My aim  was to compare the results of the experiments with the experiences of  the various individuals which they themselves reported concerning  their decisions in unexpected complicated situations, and moreover  with the judgments of their friends whom I asked to describe what they  would expect from the subjects under such conditions. The personal  differences in these respects are extremely great, and are also  evident in the midst of small groups of persons who may have great  similarity in their education and training and in many other aspects  of their lives.    Among the most advanced students of my research laboratory, for  instance, all of whom have rather similar schooling and practically  the same training in experimental work, the product of mistakes and  seconds varied between 348 and 13,335. That smallest value occurred in  a case in which the time was 116 seconds and the sum of the mistakes  only 3, inasmuch as 3 cards of the most difficult group where the  predominating letter occurred only 15 times were put in the wrong  piles. The shortest time among my laboratory students was 58 seconds,  but with this individual the sum of the mistakes, calculated on the  basis of the valuation agreed upon, was 13. The largest figure  mentioned resulted in a case in which the student needed 381 seconds  and yet made mistakes the sum of which amounted to 35. It is  characteristic that the person with the smallest product felt a  distinct joy in the experiment, while the one with the largest passed  through painful minutes which put him to real organic discomfort. If  we arrange the men simply in the order of these products, of course we  cannot recognize the various groups, as those who are quick but make  mistakes and those who make few mistakes but act slowly may be  represented by the same products. The coincidence of the results with  the self-characterization is frequently quite surprising. Every one  has at some time come into unexpected, suddenly arising situations and  many have received in such moments a very vivid impression of their  own mental reaction. They know quite well that they could not come to  a decision quickly enough, or that they rushed hastily to a wrong  decision, or that in just such instants a feeling of repose and  security came over them and that with sure instinct they turned in  the direction which they would have chosen after mature thought. The  results of the experiments in sorting the cards confirmed this  self-observation in such frequent cases that it may indeed be hoped  that a more extended test of this method will prove its practical  usefulness. It is clear that the field is a wide one, as these  different types of mental dispositions must be of consequence not only  in the ship service, but also to a certain degree in the railroad  service and in many other industrial tasks.    We have emphasized from the start that as a matter of course such a  tested function, while it is taken in its complex unity, is  nevertheless not the only psychophysical disposition of significance.  This is as true for the ship officer as it was for the motorman of the  electric car. If we were to study all the mental dispositions  necessary or desirable for the ship officer, we should find many other  qualities which are accessible to the psychological investigation. The  captain of the ship, for instance, is expected to recognize the  direction of a vessel passing in the fog by the signals of the  foghorn. But so far no one has given any attention to the  psychological conditions of localization of sound, which were for a  long while a much-studied problem of our psychological laboratories.  We know how this localization is dependent upon the comparison of the  two ears and what particular mistakes occur from the different  sensibility of the two ears. Yet there are to-day men on the bridges  of the ships who hear much better with one ear than with the other,  but who still naively believe that, as they hear everything very  distinctly with one ear, this normal ear is also sufficient for  recognizing the direction of the sound. It is the same mistake which  we frequently see among laborers whose vision has become defective in  one of their eyes, or one of whose eyes is temporarily bandaged. They  are convinced that the one good eye is sufficient for their industrial  task, because they are able to recognize everything clearly and  distinctly. They do not know that both the eyes together are necessary  in order to produce that psychological combination by which the visual  impression is projected into the right distance, and that in the  factory they are always in danger of underestimating the distance of a  wheel or some other part of the machine and of letting the hand slip  between the wheels or knives. The results of experimental psychology  will have to be introduced systematically into the study of the  fitness of the personality from the lowest to the highest technical  activity and from the simplest sensory function to the most complex  mental achievement.          X    EXPERIMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF TELEPHONE SERVICE      Our plan was to illustrate the possibility of applying psychological  experiments to the selection of fit applicants also in cases in which  not one characteristic mental function stands out, but in which a  large number of relatively independent mental activities are in play.  I choose as an illustration of such cases the work of the employees at  the telephone switchboard. A study of the psychological factors in  this work is strongly suggested by the practical interests of the  telephone companies, and may be looked on here exclusively from this  point of view. The user of the telephone is little inclined to  consider how many actions have to be carried out in the central office  before the connection is made and finally broken again.
