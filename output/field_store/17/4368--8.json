However independent and irresponsible the Boer officer may have been, he  was a man in irons compared with the Boer burgher. The burgher was bound  by no laws except such as he made for himself. There was a State law which  compelled him to join a commando and to accompany it to the front, or in  default of that law to pay a small fine. As soon as he was \"on commando,\"  as he called it, he became his own master and could laugh at Mr. Atkins  across the way who was obliged to be constantly attending to various camp  duties when not actively engaged. No general, no act of Volksraad could  compel him to do any duty if he felt uninclined to perform it, and there  was no power on earth which could compel him to move out of his tent if he  did not desire to go. In the majority of countries a man may volunteer to  join the army but when once he is a soldier he is compelled to fight, but  in the Boer country the man was compelled to join the army, but he was not  obliged to fight unless he volunteered to do so. There were hundreds of  men in the Natal laagers who never engaged in one battle and never fired a  shot in the first six months of the war. Again, there were hundreds of men  who took part in almost every one of the battles, whether their commando  was engaged or not, but they joined the fighting voluntarily and not  because they were compelled to do so.    When a Krijgsraad determined to make or resist an attack it was decided by  the officers at the meeting how many men were needed for the work.  Immediately after the meeting the officers returned to their commandos,  and, after explaining to their burghers the nature and object of the  expedition, asked for volunteers. The officer could not call upon certain  men and order them to take part in the purposed proceedings he could only  ask them to volunteer their services. It happened at times that an entire  commando of several hundred men volunteered to do the work asked of them,  but just as often it happened that only from one-tenth to one-twentieth of  the burghers expressed their willingness to accompany the expedition.  Several days after the Spion Kop battle General Botha called for four  hundred volunteers to assist in resisting an attack that it was feared  would be made. There were almost ten thousand men in the environs of  Ladysmith at that time, but it was with the utmost difficulty that the  four hundred men could be gathered. Two hundred men came from one  commando, one hundred and fifty-three from another, twenty-eight from a  third, fifteen from another, and five from another made a total of four  hundred and one men--one more than was called for.    When Commandant-General Joubert, at his Hoofd--or head-laager at  Modderspruit, received an urgent request for reinforcements he was not  able to order one of the commandos that was in laager near him to go to  the assistance of the fighting burghers; he could only make a request of  the different commandants and field-cornets to ask their men to volunteer  for the service. If the men refused to go, then naturally the  reinforcements could not be sent, and those who were in dire need of  assistance had the alternative of continuing the struggle alone or of  yielding a position to the enemy. The relief of Ladysmith was due to the  fact that Generals Botha, Erasmus, and Meyer could not receive  reinforcements from Commandant-General Joubert, who was north of Ladysmith  with almost ten thousand men. Botha, Meyer, and Erasmus had been fighting  for almost a week without a day's intermission, and their two thousand men  were utterly exhausted when Joubert was asked to send reinforcements, or  even men enough to relieve those from fighting for a day or two, but a  Krijgsraad had decided that the entire army should retreat to the  Biggarsberg, and Joubert could not, or at least would not, send any  burghers to the Tugela, with the result that Botha was compelled to  retreat and abandon positions which could have been held indefinitely if  there had been military discipline in the commandos. It was not always the  case that commandants and generals were obliged to go begging for  volunteers, and there were innumerable times when every man of a commando  did the work assigned to him without a murmur.    During the Natal campaign the force was so large, and the work seemed so  comparatively easy that the majority of the burghers never went to the  firing line, but when British successes in the Free State placed the Boers  on the defensive it was not so easy to remain behind in the laagers and  allow others more willing to engage in the fighting. General Cronje was  able to induce a much larger percentage of his men to fight than  Commandant-General Joubert, but the reasons for this were that he was much  firmer with his men and that he moved from one place to another more  frequently than Joubert. Towards the end of General Cronje's campaign all  his men were willing to enter a battle, but that was because they realised  that they must fight, and in that there was much that was lacking in the  Natal army. When a Boer realised that he must fight or lose his life or a  battle, he would fight as few other men were able to fight, but when he  imagined that his presence at the firing line was not imperative he chose  to remain in laager.    [Illustration: KRIJGSRAAD, NEAR THABA N'CHU]    There were hundreds of burghers who took part in almost every battle in  Natal, and these were the individuals who understood the frame of mind of  some of their countrymen, and determined that they must take upon  themselves the responsibilities of fighting and winning battles. Among  those who were most forward in fighting were the Johannesburg police, the  much-despised \"Zarps\" of peaceful times; the Pretoria commando, and the  younger men of other commandos. There were many old Boers who left their  laagers whenever they heard the report of a gun, but the ages of the great  majority of those who were killed or injured were between seventeen and  thirty years. After the British captured Bloemfontein, and the memorable  Krijgsraad at Kroonstad determined that guerilla warfare should be  followed thereafter, it was not an easy matter for a burgher to remain  behind in the laagers, for the majority of the ox-waggons and other camp  paraphernalia was sent home and laager life was not so attractive as  before. Commandos remained at one place only a short time, and there was  almost a daily opportunity for a brush with the enemy. The war had been  going on for six months, but many of the men had their first taste of  actual war as late as that, and, after the first battle had been safely  passed through, the following ones were thought of little consequence.  When General Christian De Wet began his campaign in the eastern part of  the Free State there were hardly enough men left in the laagers to guard  them properly when battles were in progress, and in the battles at  Sannaspost, Moester's Hoek, and Wepener probably ninety-nine per cent. of  his men took part in every battle. In Natal the real fighting spirit was  lacking from the majority of the men, or Commandant-General Joubert might  never have been wiped aside from the path to Durban; but months afterward,  when the burgher learned that his services were actually needed, and that,  if he did not fight, he was liable to be captured and sent to St. Helena,  he polished his Mauser and fought as hard and well as he was able.    The same carelessness or indifference which manifested itself throughout  the early part of the Natal campaign with regard to the necessity of  assisting in the fighting was evident in that all-important part of an  army's work, the guarding of the laagers. The Boers did not have sentries  or outposts as they are understood in trained armies, but they had what  was called a \"Brandwacht,\" or fire-guard, which consisted of a hundred men  or more who were supposed to take positions at a certain distance from the  laagers, and remain there until daybreak. These men were volunteers  secured by the corporal, who was responsible to his field-cornet for a  certain number of men every night. It was never made compulsory upon any  one to go on Brandwacht, but the duty was not considered irksome, and  there were always as many volunteers as were required for the work.    The men on Brandwacht carried with them blankets, pipes, and kettles, and,  after reaching the point which they were to occupy during the night, they  tethered their horse to one of their feet and made themselves comfortable  with pipe and coffee. When the enemy was known to be near by the  Brandwacht kept awake, as a matter of personal safety, but when there  seemed to be no danger of attack he fastened his blankets around his body  and, using his saddle for a pillow, slept until the sun rose. There was a  mild punishment for those who slept while on this duty, and occasionally  the burgher found in the morning that some one had extracted the bolt of  his rifle during the night. When the corporal produced the bolt as  evidence against him in the morning and sentenced him to carry a stone or  a box of biscuits on his head the burgher might decline to be punished,  and no one could say aught against his determination.    The Boer scouts, or spies as they called them, received their finest  tribute from Sir George White, the British Commander at Ladysmith. In a  speech which he delivered at Cape Town, Sir George said--    \"All through this campaign, from the first day the Boers crossed the  frontier to the relief of Ladysmith, I and others who have been in command  near "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#12)"],[1," lets the elemental  and brute forces of sound and pure rhythm have their fling.\"[101] It is  scarcely music, it is the force of Nature herself. Berlioz himself calls  his _Requiem_ \"a musical cataclysm.\"[102]        [Footnote 99: _Memoires_, II, 364. See also the letter quoted above.]    [Footnote 100: _Memoires_, II, 363. See also II, 163, and the  description of the great festival of 1844, with its 1,022 performers.]    [Footnote 101: Hermann Kretzschmar, _Fuehrer durch den Konzertsaal_.]    [Footnote 102: _Memoires_, I, 312.]    These hurricanes are let loose in order to speak to the people, to stir  and rouse the dull ocean of humanity. The _Requiem_ is a Last Judgment,  not meant, like that of the Sixtine Chapel (which Berlioz did not care  for at all) for great aristocracies, but for a crowd, a surging,  excited, and rather savage crowd. The _Marche de Rakoczy_ is less an  Hungarian march than the music for a revolutionary fight; it sounds the  charge; and Berlioz tells us it might bear Virgil's verses for a  motto:--        \" ... Furor iraque mentes      Praecipitant, pulchrumque mori succurrit in armis.\"[103]    When Wagner heard the _Symphonic funebre et triomphale_ he was forced to  admit Berlioz's \"skill in writing compositions that were popular in the  best sense of the word.\"         \"In listening to that symphony I had a lively impression that any       little street boy in a blue blouse and red bonnet would understand       it perfectly. I have no hesitation in giving precedence to that       work over Berlioz's other works; it is big and noble from the first       note to the last; a fine and eager patriotism rises from its first       expression of compassion to the final glory of the apotheosis, and       keeps it from any unwholesome exaggeration. I want gladly to       express my conviction that that symphony will fire men's courage       and will live as long as a nation bears the name of France.\"[104]    [Footnote 103: Letter to some young Hungarians, 14 February, 1861. See  the _Memoires_, II, 212, for the incredible emotion which the _Marche de  Rakoczy_ roused in the audience at Budapest, and, above all, for the  astonishing scene at the end:--         \"I saw a man enter unexpectedly. He was miserably clad, but his       face shone with a strange rapture. When he saw me, he threw himself       upon me and embraced me with fervour; his eyes filled with tears,       and he was hardly able to get out the words, 'Ah, monsieur,       monsieur! moi Hongrois ... pauvre diable ... pas parler Francais       ... un poco Italiano. Pardonnez mon extase.... Ah! ai compris votre       canon.... Oui, oui, la grande-bataille.... Allemands chiens!' And       then striking his breast violently: 'Dans le coeur, moi ... je vous       porte.... _Ah! Francais ... revolutionnaire ... savoir faire la       musique des revolutions_!'\"]    [Footnote 104: Written 5 May, 1841.]    How do such works come to be neglected by our Republic? How is it they  have not a place in our public life? Why are they not part of our great  ceremonies? That is what one would wonderingly ask oneself if one had  not seen, for the last century, the indifference of the State to Art.  What might not Berlioz have done if the means had been given him, or if  his works had found a place in the fetes of the Revolution? Unhappily,  one must add that here again his character was the enemy of his genius.  As this apostle of musical freedom, in the second part of his life,  became afraid of himself and recoiled before the results of his own  principles, and returned to classicism, so this revolutionary fell to  sullenly disparaging the people and revolutions; and he talks about \"the  republican cholera,\" \"the dirty and stupid republic,\" \"the republic of  street-porters and rag-gatherers,\" \"the filthy rabble of humanity a  hundred times more stupid and animal in its twitchings and revolutionary  grimacings than the baboons and orang-outangs of Borneo.\"[105]    [Footnote 105: Berlioz never ceased to inveigh against the Revolution of  1848--which should have had his sympathies. Instead of finding material,  like Wagner, in the excitement of that time for impassioned  compositions, he worked at _L'Enfance du Christ_. He affected absolute  indifference--he who was so little made for indifference. He approved  the State's action, and despised its visionary hopes.] What  ingratitude! He owed to these revolutions, to these democratic storms,  to these human tempests, the best of all his genius--and he disowned it  all. This musician of a new era took refuge in the past.           *       *       *       *       *    Well, what did it matter? Whether he wished it or not, he opened out  some magnificent roads for Art. He has shown the music of France the way  in which her genius should tread; he has shown her possibilities she had  never before dreamed of. He has given us a musical utterance at once  truthful and expressive, free from foreign traditions, coming from the  depths of our being, and reflecting our spirit; an utterance which  responded to his imagination, to his instinct for what was picturesque,  to his fleeting impressions, and his delicate shades of feeling. He has  laid the strong foundation of a national and popular music for the  greatest republic in Europe.    These are shining qualities. If Berlioz had had Wagner's reasoning power  and had made the utmost use of his intuitions, if he had had Wagner's  will and had shaped the inspirations of his genius and welded them into  a solid whole, I venture to say that he would have made a revolution in  music greater than Wagner's own; for Wagner, though stronger and more  master of himself, was less original and, at bottom, but the close of a  glorious past.    Will that revolution still be accomplished? Perhaps; but it has suffered  half a century's delay. Berlioz bitterly calculated that people would  begin to understand him about the year 1940.[106]    After all, why be astonished that his mighty mission was too much for  him? He was so alone.[107] As people forsook him, his loneliness stood  out in greater relief. He was alone in the age of Wagner, Liszt,  Schumann, and Franck; alone, yet containing a whole world in himself, of  which his enemies, his friends, his admirers, and he himself, were not  quite conscious; alone, and tortured by his loneliness. Alone--the word  is repeated by the music of his youth and his old age, by the _Symphonie  fantastique_ and _Les Troyens_. It is the word I read in the portrait  before me as I write these lines--the beautiful portrait of the  _Memoires_, where his face looks out in sad and stern reproach on the  age that so misunderstood him.    [Footnote 106: \"My musical career would finish very pleasingly if only I  could live for a hundred and forty years\" _(Memoires_, II, 390).]    [Footnote 107: This solitude struck Wagner. \"Berlioz's loneliness is not  only one of external circumstances; its origin is in his temperament.  Though he is a Frenchman, with quick sympathies and interests like those  of his fellow-citizens, yet he is none the less alone. He sees no one  before him who will hold out a helping hand, there is no one by his side  on whom he may lean\" (Article written 5 May, 1841). As one reads these  words, one feels it was Wagner's lack of sympathy and not his  intelligence that prevented him from understanding Berlioz. In his heart  I do not doubt that he knew well who was his great rival. But he never  said anything about it--unless perhaps one counts an odd document,  certainly not intended for publication, where he (even he) compares him  to Beethoven and to Bonaparte (Manuscript in the collection of Alfred  Bovet, published by Mottl in German magazines, and by M. Georges de  Massougnes in the _Revue d'art dramatique_, 1 January, 1902).]          WAGNER    \"SIEGFRIED\"      There is nothing so thrilling as first impressions. I remember when, as  a child, I heard fragments of Wagner's music for the first time at one  of old Pasdeloup's concerts in the Cirque d'Hiver. I was taken there one  dull and foggy Sunday afternoon; and as we left the yellow fog outside  and entered the hall we were met by an overpowering warmth, a dazzling  blaze of light, and the murmuring voice of the crowd. My eyes were  blinded, I breathed with difficulty, and my limbs soon became cramped;  for we sat on wooden benches, crushed in a narrow space between solid  walls of human beings. But with the first note of the music all was  forgotten, and one fell into a state of painful yet delicious torpor.  Perhaps one's very discomfort made the pleasure keener. Those who know  the intoxication of climbing a mountain know also how closely it is  associated with the discomforts of the climb--with fatigue and the  blinding light of the sun, with out-of-breathness, and all the other  sensations that rouse and stimulate life and make the body tingle, so  that the remembrance of it all is carved indelibly on the mind. The  comfort of a playhouse adds nothing to the illusion of a play; and it  may even be due to the entire inconvenience of the old concert-rooms  that I owe my vivid recollection of my first meeting with Wagner's work.    How mysterious it was, and what a strange agitation it filled me with!  There were new effects of orchestration, new timbres, new rhythms, and  new subjects; it held the wild poetry of the far-away Middle Ages and  old legends, it throbbed with the fever of our hidden sorrows and  desires. I did not understand it very well. How should I? The music was  taken from works quite unknown to me. It was almost impossible to seize  the connection of the ideas on account of the poor acoustics of the  room, the bad arrangement of the orchestra, and the unskilled  players--all of which served to break up the musical design and spoil  the harmony of its colouring.
