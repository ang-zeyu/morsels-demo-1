Gaspard's path  wound along near the shore of the gulfs and bays of the Mediterranean,  until at last the the star turned southward and drew him nearer and  nearer to a great city, and finally stood still over the dome of a  vast cathedral. \"It must be,\" thought Gaspard, \"that I have come to  the end of my search. This must be the capital and palace of the  eternal king.\"    [Sidenote: Marbled Aisle's Magnificence]    The square in front of the cathedral was thronged with people;  multitudes were pouring in through the great portals. Gaspard joined  the throngs, and at last found himself under the mighty dome, which  seemed to him as far away as the sky itself. Everything in this  wonderful place appealed to his imagination. There were great rows of  massive columns, symbol of a strength eternal, and they seemed like  wide-open arms holding out a welcome to the human race. There were  statues and paintings by great masters in art. The light of the sun  poured in through many-colored windows, on which were blazoned the  deeds of heroes and saints. Strains of music from the great organ in  the distance floated out upon the air. Touched and thrilled by all he  saw, Gaspard exclaimed to himself: \"The place on which I stand is  holy ground.\"    [Sidenote: Kyrie Eleison]    Soon, however, he perceived that the throngs of people were not  lingering, like himself, in awe and wonder over the great columns and  the dome, and the statues, and the paintings, and the windows. Their  eyes were fixed intently upon something that was going on in the far  end of the cathedral. An altar was there, and priests in white robes  passing up and down before it, and tall tapers burning around it. Near  the altar was the image of a man hanging from a cross; his hands and  feet were pierced with nails, and a cruel wound was in his side. The  people were gazing at this altar, and at the image, and at what the  white-robed priests were doing. The strains of solemn music from the  organ blended with the voices of priests chanting the service. Clouds  of incense rose from censers, swung with solemn motion by the  altar-boys, and the fragrance of the incense was wafted down the long  aisles. At last, the tinkling of a bell. The organ became silent for  an instant, as though it felt within its heart the awful solemnity of  the moment; and then it burst forth into new rapture, and the people  began pouring out through the great doors.    [Sidenote: We Must Follow the Star]    Gaspard went forth with the throng into the cathedral square. \"And  this,\" he said, \"is the end of my search. I have found the Christ. His  kingdom is in the imagination of man. How beautiful, how wonderful,  how strange it was! 'Dominus vobiscum,' did not the priests say? Here,  then, at last I have found the city of the great King.\"    But as he lingered, behold! the star which had stood over the dome  of the cathedral was now before him, as at first, and seemed to waver  and tremble, as if beckoning him on. So, although his feet seemed  bound to the spot, and his heart was still throbbing with the deep  feelings the cathedral service had created in him, remembering the  words of Balthazar, \"we must follow the star,\" he slowly and reluctantly  walked on.    [Sidenote: The Just Shall Live by Faith]    In the meantime Melchoir also had followed faithfully the path along  which the star seemed to lead. Through forests in which he almost lost  his way, across rivers difficult and dangerous to ford--still he  followed on. At length Melchoir's star seemed to tarry over the spire  of a gothic church, into which the people were going in throngs.  Waiting a moment, to be sure that the star was actually standing  still, Melchoir went in with the rest. In this place was no altar,  such as Gaspard saw; no image on the cross; no white-robed priests; no  swinging censers. But, as Melchoir entered he heard strains from the  organ, and a chorus of voices was singing an anthem beginning with  the words, \"Te Deum Laudamus.\" And when the anthem came to a close, a  man clothed in a black robe, such as scholars were wont to wear, rose  in his place upon a platform elevated above the people, and began to  speak to them about the kingdom of Christ. Melchoir listened in eager  expectancy. [Sidenote: The Truth Shall Make You Free] \"The kingdom of  the Christ,\" the preacher said, \"is the kingdom of the truth, and the  truth is to be continued and kept alive by the strength of man's belief.  Those things which have been handed down by holy men and sacred oracles  since Christ was here upon the earth, are the truths by which we live.  How can Christ live except He live in our beliefs? Why did the Father  of all intrust us with our reasons, unless it were that we should  make them the instruments of our faith and our salvation? Let us  therefore stand in our places, while we recite together the articles  of our holy faith.\"    These and many such words did the scholar-preacher declare. And as he  sat there with the people, Melchoir felt the weight of the solemn and  earnest words, and he said: \"So at last have I come to the end of my  search. The kingdom of Christ is in the mind of man. His kingdom is  the kingdom of the truth.\"    [Sidenote: More Light Shall Break Forth]    Then he followed the throngs as they went forth from the church; but  the star which had tarried over the lofty spire was now before him,  and the opal light wavered and trembled, as if beckoning him on; and  the words of the preacher, \"we must believe,\" seemed to blend with the  words of Balthazar, \"we must follow the star.\" So, reluctantly and  slowly he followed on.    [Sidenote: Thy Sacramental Liturgies]    But Balthazar--whither went he, following the star? Over many a rugged  way, through many a tangled thicket, through valleys and over hills.  His star tarried over no cathedrals; it lingered over no Gothic  spires. It seemed capricious and restless and tireless. At times it  seemed intent on coming to a pause over the head of some human being,  but perhaps it was because these human beings themselves were so  restless and so busy that the star could not accomplish its intent.  For Balthazar saw these men and women hurrying hither and thither on  errands of mercy, or deeds of justice; he saw them ferreting out great  wrongs, laying heavy blows on the backs of men who oppressed and  defrauded their fellow men.    At length Balthazar seemed to understand the movements of the star,  and, drawing nearer, he would seem to hear these men repeating  cheering and encouraging words to one another. \"Pure religion and  undefiled,\" he heard one exclaiming, \"is to visit the fatherless and  widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the  world.\" And another echoed, \"Inasmuch as we do it to the least of  these, we do it unto Christ.\"    [Sidenote: The Joy of Doing Good]    \"Ah! thought Balthazar as he listened, I see the meaning of it now; I  am coming to the end of my search. The kingdom of Christ--I have found  it. It is in the deeds of men; it is in the conscience and the serving  will. Devotion to right, this is the law of the kingdom of Christ.\"    Then Balthazar turned to go in search of his comrades again; but  behold! the opal star was trembling, as if beckoning him on. So, still  doubting if he had reached the end of his search, he followed the  star.    [Sidenote: The Paths Converge]    Thus Gaspard, Melchoir and Balthazar, each following the star, at last  approached each other. The star of each seemed to melt and blend into  the star of the others, and the opal light stood at last in the center  of the group. Gaspard exclaimed: \"I have found that which we all were  seeking. The kingdom of Christ is in the imagination; Christ lives in  what man feels.\"    \"Nay,\" said Melchoir, \"I have followed the star, and I have found what  we sought. The kingdom of Christ is in the reason of man. Christ lives  in what man believes.\"    \"But,\" cried Balthazar, \"my star has led me to a different end. The  kingdom of Christ is in the will of man. Christ lives in what man  does.\"    \"The truth,\" once more exclaimed Melchoir, \"is the law of the  kingdom.\"    \"Not truth,\" declared Balthazar, \"but justice, righteousness, goodness  and purity--these are its laws and its marks.\"    \"Nay, comrades beloved, hearken to me,\" answered Gaspard, \"it is the  miracle of the divine presence. It is God among men, realized in the  holy mass. I beheld it all in yonder cathedral.\"    But lo! once more the star began to tremble and to change its place.    \"Let us follow the star!\" Balthazar whispered. \"We will follow it,\"  echoed the other two.    [Sidenote: Once More the Quest]    Then the star led them on, and they followed together until they came  at length to the doorway of a little cottage; and within the cottage  they saw a woman bending over a cradle, and in the cradle a little  child lay sleeping. She was a peasant woman; her clothing was not  rich; the furnishing of the cottage was humble and scanty. The cradle  itself was rude, as if put together by hands unskilful in tasks like  that. But when the mother looked at her babe a sweet smile played  about her lips, and a light was in her eyes. Then all suddenly the  three men remembered another scene long before, when they were bearers  of gold and frankincense and myrrh to another babe.    [Sidenote: He That Loveth Knoweth God]    And while they stood and wondered by the door, there came a strong and  sturdy peasant, broad-shouldered, roughly clad, his face browned in  the sun, his hands hardened with toil. He came and stood beside the  woman, and they bent together over the cradle of the sleeping child,  and the man drew the woman tenderly toward him and kissed her brow.    And still the three men lingered; for behold! the star stood still  above the child, and they dared not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#12)"],[1,", instead of assisting in the composition of the groups of  roofs, stand out in staring masses of scarlet and black, with foxes and  cocks whisking about, like so many little black devils, in the smoke on  the top of them, interrupting all repose, annihilating all dignity, and  awaking every possible conception which would be picturesque, and every  imagination which would be rapturous, to the mind of master-sweeps.    80. On the other hand, though they have not on the Continent the same  knowledge of the use and beauty of chimneys in the abstract, they  display their usual good taste in grouping, or concealing them; and,  whether we find them mingling with the fantastic domiciles of the  German, with the rich imaginations of the Spaniard, with the classical  remains and creations of the Italian, they are never intrusive or  disagreeable; and either assist the grouping, and relieve the  horizontality of the lines of the roof, or remain entirely unnoticed and  insignificant, smoking their pipes in peace.    81. It is utterly impossible to give rules for the attainment of these  effects, since they are the result of a feeling of the proportion and  relation of lines, which, if not natural to a person, cannot be  acquired, but by long practice and close observation; and it presupposes  a power rarely bestowed on an English architect, of setting regularity  at defiance, and sometimes comfort out of the question. We could give  some particular examples of this grouping; but, as this paper has  already swelled to an unusual length, we shall defer them until we come  to the consideration of street effects in general. Of the chimney in the  abstract, we are afraid we have only said enough to illustrate, without  removing, the difficulty of designing it; but we cannot but think that  the general principles which have been deduced, if carefully followed  out, would be found useful, if not for the attainment of excellence, at  least for the prevention of barbarism.    OXFORD, _Feb. 10, [1838]._          VI.    THE COTTAGE--CONCLUDING REMARKS.    \"Nunquam aliud Natura, aliud Sapientia, dicit.\"    _Juvenal_ xiv. 321.      82. It now only remains for us to conclude the subject of the cottage,  by a few general remarks on the just application of modern buildings to  adorn or vivify natural scenery.    There are, we think, only three cases in which the cottage is considered  as an element of architectural, or any other kind of beauty, since it is  ordinarily raised by the peasant where he likes, and how he likes; and,  therefore, as we have seen, frequently in good taste.    83. I. When a nobleman, or man of fortune, amuses himself with  superintending the erection of the domiciles of his domestics. II. When  ornamental summer-houses, or mimicries of wigwams, are to be erected as  ornamental adjuncts to a prospect which the owner has done all he can to  spoil, that it may be worthy of the honor of having him to look at it.  III. When the landlord exercises a certain degree of influence over the  cottages of his tenants, or the improvements of the neighboring village,  so as to induce such a tone of feeling in the new erections as he may  think suitable to the situation.    84. In the first of these cases, there is little to be said; for the  habitation of the domestic is generally a dependent feature of his  master's, and, therefore, to be considered as a part of it. Porters'  lodges are also dependent upon, and to be regulated by, the style of the  architecture to which they are attached; and they are generally well  managed in England, properly united with the gate, and adding to the  effect of the entrance.    In the second case, as the act is in itself a barbarism, it would be  useless to consider what would be the best mode of perpetrating it.    In the third case, we think it will be useful to apply a few general  principles, deduced from positions formerly advanced.    85. All buildings are, of course, to be considered in connection with  the country in which they are to be raised. Now, all landscape must  possess one out of four distinct characters.    It must be either woody, the green country; cultivated, the blue  country; wild, the gray country; or hilly, the brown country.    I. The Woody, or green, Country. By this is to be understood the mixture  of park, pasture, and variegated forest, which is only to be seen in  temperate climates, and in those parts of a kingdom which have not often  changed proprietors, but have remained in unproductive beauty (or at  least, furnishing timber only), the garden of the wealthier population.  It is to be seen in no other country, perhaps, so well as in England. In  other districts, we find extensive masses of black forest, but not the  mixture of sunny glade, and various foliage, and dewy sward, which we  meet with in the richer park districts of England. This kind of country  is always surgy, oceanic, and massy, in its outline: it never affords  blue distances, unless seen from a height; and, even then, the nearer  groups are large, and draw away the attention from the background. The  under soil is kept cool by the shade, and its vegetation rich; so that  the prevailing color, except for a few days at the fall of the leaf, is  a fresh green. A good example of this kind of country is the view from  Richmond Hill.    86. Now, first, let us consider what sort of feeling this green country  excites; and, in order to do so, be it observed, that anything which is  apparently enduring and unchangeable gives us an impression rather of  future, than of past, duration of existence; but anything which being  perishable, and from its nature subject to change, has yet existed to a  great age, gives us an impression of antiquity, though, of course, none  of stability. A mountain, for instance (not geologically speaking, for  then the furrows on its brow give it age as visible as was ever wrinkled  on human forehead, but considering it as it appears to ordinary eyes),  appears to be beyond the influence of change: it does not put us in mind  of its past existence, by showing us any of the effect of time upon  itself; we do not feel that it is old, because it is not approaching any  kind of death; it is a mass of unsentient undecaying matter, which, if  we think about it, we discover must have existed for some time, but  which does not tell this fact to our feelings, or, rather, which tells  us of no time at which it came into existence; and therefore, gives us  no standard by which to measure its age, which, unless measured, cannot  be distinctly felt. But a very old forest tree is a thing subject to the  same laws of nature as ourselves: it is an energetic being, liable to an  approaching death; its age is written on every spray; and, because we  see it is susceptible of life and annihilation, like our own, we imagine  it must be capable of the same feelings, and possess the same faculties,  and, above all others, memory: it is always telling us about the past,  never pointing to the future; we appeal to it, as to a thing which has  seen and felt during a life similar to our own, though of ten times its  duration, and therefore receive from it a perpetual impression of  antiquity. So again a ruined town gives us an impression of antiquity;  the stones of which it is built, none; for their age is not written upon  them.    87. This being the case, it is evident that the chief feeling induced by  woody country is one of reverence for its antiquity. There is a quiet  melancholy about the decay of the patriarchal trunks, which is enhanced  by the green and elastic vigor of the young saplings; the noble form of  the forest aisles, and the subdued light which penetrates their  entangled boughs, combine to add to the impression; and the whole  character of the scene is calculated to excite conservative feeling.  The man who could remain a radical in a wood country is a disgrace to  his species.    88. Now, this feeling of mixed melancholy and veneration is the one of  all others which the modern cottage must not be allowed to violate. It  may be fantastic or rich in detail; for the one character will make it  look old-fashioned, and the other will assimilate with the intertwining  of leaf and bough around it: but it must not be spruce, or natty, or  very bright in color; and the older it looks the better.    A little grotesqueness in form is the more allowable, because the  imagination is naturally active in the obscure and indefinite daylight  of wood scenery; conjures up innumerable beings, of every size and  shape, to people its alleys and smile through its thickets; and is by no  means displeased to find some of its inventions half-realized in a  decorated panel or grinning extremity of a rafter.    89. These characters being kept in view, as objects to be attained, the  remaining considerations are technical.    For the form. Select any well-grown group of the tree which prevails  most near the proposed site of the cottage. Its summit will be a rounded  mass. Take the three principal points of its curve: namely, its apex and  the two points where it unites itself with neighboring masses. Strike a  circle through these three points; and the angle contained in the  segment cut off by a line joining the two lower points is to be the  angle of the cottage roof. (Of course we are not thinking of interior  convenience: the architect must establish his mode of beauty first, and  then approach it as nearly as he can.) This angle will generally be very  obtuse; and this is one reason why the Swiss cottage is always beautiful  when it is set among walnut or chestnut trees. Its obtuse roof is just  about the true angle. With pines or larches, the angle should not be  regulated by the form of the tree, but by the slope of the branches. The  building itself should be low and long, so that, if possible, it may not  be seen all at once, but may be partially concealed by trunks or leafage  at various"]]]
