After normal weight is reached  he will not have to be nearly so abstemious, _but_ the same dietetic  errors which produced overweight in the first place will produce it  again. So he must know something of dietetics and he must have a  balanced diet.    Now I shall make out some balanced menus, 1200 C's a day, being careful  to include a large amount of the leafy vegetables and some milk or its  products, the foods that McCollom calls PROTECTIVE FOODS because they  contain in a large measure the essential mineral salts, and those vital  elements he has called \"Fat soluble A\" and \"Water soluble B\"--others  call vitamines--which he has proved to be so vital and necessary for  growth in the young and the maintenance of health in the adult. I shall  also include 200-300 C's of protein.    The leafy vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, celery tops, lettuce, onion,  Swiss chard, turnip tops, and other leaves employed as greens, water  cress, etc., not only contain these vital elements, but they also exert  a favourable influence on sluggish bowels and kidneys. They are low in  caloric value, hence are low in fat-producing properties, and can be  consumed with indiscretion, properly masticated.    It is better while you are reducing to stay away from the dining table  when you do not expect to eat. If you are rooming, get a tiny sterno  outfit, some substitute or coffee, some canned or dry milk, some sugar  if you use it, and you can make a hot drink in your room and be  independent for your breakfast and your evening meal, when you decide  some day to go without that. Do not take more than 100 calories for your  breakfast. That leaves you 1100 calories to be divided during the day if  you go on a 1200 calorie schedule. I suggest the following distribution  of the calories:         Breakfast                      100 C's.       Lunch                          350   \"       Tea                            100   \"       Dinner                         650   \"    You can reverse the dinner and lunch if you desire. If you do so then  have your 100 calories I have allowed for tea time to take just before  you retire. On a 1200 calorie schedule arranged as I have it you will  not be hungry, I assure you. It will not be more than three or four days  before your stomach will be shrunk and this amount I have allowed you  will almost seem like overeating! That is the big idea. Shrink your  stomach. Go on a fast or low calorie day for a day if necessary to get  started. See page 81.    I can safely say that any up and around adult will reduce on 1200  calories, for that will not supply the basal metabolism, i.e., the  body's internal activities, such as the beating of the heart,  respiration, digestion, excretion, etc., and some of the body's stored  fat will be called upon to supply the deficiency. How much one will  reduce depends on how many calories are actually needed for the internal  and the external activities. See pages 26 and 27. It is not advisable to  reduce too rapidly. See page 85.    Now you have 1200 calories a day to eat. Let us think of this in terms  of money. You have a limited amount of money every day to spend for  food. You must spend it judiciously and get the food you need and want.  If you spend the most of it on one article you have that much less for  other things. It is possible that some days you will want to spend more  than your allowance and you draw on your next day's supply. That will be  all right if you remember that you have done so and will spend that much  less the next day to equalize your account. You must study to spend  wisely and carefully so as to supply your needs, but you cannot spend  more than you have without restitution and retribution. Here are the  menus:      BREAKFASTS    100 C.

The  red gum is usually compared to that called sanguis draconis, but differs  from it by being perfectly soluble in water, whereas the other, being  more properly a resin, will not dissolve except in spirits of wine. It  may be drawn from the tree by tapping, or taken out of the veins of the  wood when dry, in which it is copiously distributed. The leaves are long  and narrow, not unlike those of a willow. The wood is heavy and fine  grained, but being much intersected by the channels containing the gum,  splits and warps in such a manner as soon to become entirely useless;  especially when worked up, as necessity at first occasioned it to be,  without having been properly seasoned.    The yellow gum as it is called, is strictly a resin, not being at all  soluble in water; in appearance it strongly resembles gamboge, but has  not the property of staining. The plant that produces it is low and  small, with long grassy leaves; but the fructification of it shoots out  in a singular manner from the centre of the leaves, on a single straight  stem, to the height of twelve or fourteen feet. Of this stem, which is  strong and light, like some of the reed class, the natives usually make  their spears; sometimes pointing them with a piece of the same substance  made sharp, but more frequently with bone. The resin is generally dug up  out of the soil under the tree, not collected from it, and may perhaps be  that which Tasman calls \"gum lac of the ground.\" The form of this plant  is very exactly delineated in the annexed plate, and its proportion to  other trees may be collected from the plate, entitled, A View in New  South Wales, in which many of this species are introduced.    The month of February was ushered in by a very violent storm of thunder  and rain. The lightning struck and shivered a tree, under which a shed  had been erected for some sheep, and five of those animals were at the  same time unfortunately destroyed by it. The encampment still went on  with great alacrity, so that in the beginning of this month the work of  building public storehouses was undertaken; and unremitting diligence  began, though very gradually, to triumph over the obstacles which the  nature of the place presented.    Chapter VIII.    February 1788    Description of Port Jackson and the adjacent country--The Governor's  commission read--his Speech--his humane resolutions respecting the  Natives--difficulties in erecting huts and other buildings--departure of  Lieutenant King to Norfolk Island.  A View in Port Jackson.    Port Jackson was not visited or explored by Captain Cook; it was seen  only at the distance of between two or three miles from the coast: had  any good fortune conducted him into that harbour, he would have found it  much more worthy of his attention as a seaman, than that in which he  passed a week. Governor Phillip himself pronounces it to be a harbour, in  extent and security, superior to any he has ever seen: and the most  experienced navigators who were with him fully concur in that opinion.  From an entrance not more than two miles across, Port Jackson gradually  extends into a noble and capacious bason; having soundings sufficient for  the largest vessels, and space to accommodate, in perfect security, any  number that could be assembled. It runs chiefly in a western direction,  about thirteen miles into the country, and contains not less than an  hundred small coves, formed by narrow necks of land, whose projections  afford admirable shelter from all winds. Sydney Cove lies on the South  side of the harbour, between five and six miles from the entrance. The  necks of land that form the coves are mostly covered with timber, yet so  rocky that it is not easy to comprehend how the trees could have found  sufficient nourishment to bring them to so considerable a magnitude; but  the soil between the rocks is very good, and into those spaces the  principal roots have found their way. The soil in other parts of the  coast immediately about Port Jackson is of various qualities. That neck  of land which divides the south end of the harbour from the sea is  chiefly sand. Between Sydney Cove and Botany Bay the first space is  occupied by a wood, in some parts a mile and a half, in others three  miles across; beyond that, is a kind of heath, poor, sandy, and full of  swamps. As far as the eye can reach to the westward, the country is one  continued wood. The head of the bay in Port Jackson, seemed at first to  offer some advantages of ground, but as it is partly left dry at low  water, and as the winds are much obstructed there by the woods and by the  windings of the channel, it was deemed that it must probably be  unhealthful, till the country can be cleared.    There are several parts of the harbour in which the trees stand at a  greater distance from each other than in Sydney Cove; some of these which  have small runs of water, and a promising soil, Governor Phillip purposed  to cultivate as soon as hands could be spared; but the advantage of being  able to land the stores and provisions with so much ease, unavoidably  determined his choice of a place for the principal settlement. Had it  been attempted to remove those necessaries only one mile from the spot  where they were landed, the undertaking probably would have been  fruitless; so many were the obstacles to land carriage. At the head of  Sydney Cove, therefore, Governor Phillip had fixed the seat of his  government; but intent upon providing the best and earliest accommodation  for those who were to be encamped with him; and wholly occupied by the  continual necessity of giving directions, he had not yet found leisure  for assuming regularly his powers and title of Governor. At length the  hurry of the first preparations gave way to this more tranquil business.    7 February 1788    The 7th of February, 1788, was the memorable day which established a  regular form of Government on the coast of New South Wales. For obvious  reasons, all possible solemnity was given to the proceedings necessary on  this occasion. On a space previously cleared, the whole colony was  assembled; the military drawn up, and under arms; the convicts stationed  apart; and near the person of the Governor, those who were to hold the  principal offices under him. The Royal Commission was then read by Mr. D.  Collins, the Judge Advocate. By this instrument Arthur Phillip was  constituted and appointed Captain General and Governor in Chief in and  over the territory, called New South Wales; extending from the northern  cape, or extremity of the coast, called Cape York, in the latitude of ten  degrees, thirty-seven minutes south, to the southern extremity of the  said territory of New South Wales, or South Cape, in the latitude of  forty-three degrees, thirty-nine minutes south, and of all the country  inland to the westward, as far as the one hundred and thirty-fifth degree  of east longitude, reckoning from the meridian of Greenwich, including  all the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean, within the latitudes  aforesaid of 10 deg.. 37'. south, and 43 deg.. 39'. south, and of all towns,  garrisons, castles, forts, and all other fortifications, or other  military works which may be hereafter erected upon the said territory, or  any of the said islands. The act of Parliament establishing the courts of  judicature was next read; and lastly, the patents under the great seal,  empowering the proper persons to convene and hold those courts whenever  the exigency should require. The Office of Lieutenant Governor was  conferred on Major Ross, of the Marines. A triple discharge of musquetry  concluded this part of the ceremony; after which Governor Phillip  advanced, and addressing first the private soldiers, thanked them for  their steady good conduct on every occasion: an honour which was repeated  to them in the next general orders. He then turned to the convicts, and  distinctly explained to them the nature of their present situation. The  greater part, he bade them recollect, had already forfeited their lives  to the justice of their country: yet, by the lenity of its laws, they  were now so placed that, by industry and good behaviour, they might in  time regain the advantages and estimation in society of which they had  deprived themselves. They not only had every encouragement to make that  effort, but were removed almost entirely from every temptation to guilt.  There was little in this infant community which one man could plunder  from another, and any dishonest attempts in so small a society would  almost infallibly be discovered. To persons detected in such crimes, he  could not promise any mercy; nor indeed to any whom, under their  circumstances, should presume to offend against the peace and good order  of the settlement. What mercy could do for them they had already  experienced; nor could any good be now expected from those whom neither  past warnings, nor the peculiarities of their present situation could  preserve from guilt. Against offenders, therefore, the rigour of the law  would certainly be put in force: while they whose behaviour should in any  degree promise reformation, might always depend upon encouragement fully  proportioned to their deserts. He particularly noticed the illegal  intercourse between the sexes as an offence which encouraged a general  profligacy of manners, and was in several ways injurious to society. To  prevent this, he strongly recommended marriage, and promised every kind  of countenance and assistance to those who, by entering into that state,  should manifest their willingness to conform to the laws of morality and  religion. Governor Phillip concluded his address, by declaring his  earnest desire to promote the happiness of all who were under his  government, and to render the settlement in New South Wales advantageous  and honourabe to his country.
