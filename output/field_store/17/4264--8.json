I feel another man now--so  smart.\"    And he told the landlord he was certainly a wise man now, though he  couldn't speak over-distinctly after drinking so much. So up he got, and  thought he would go home and tell his mother she hadn't a fool for a son  any more.    But just as he was trying to get through the inn-door which would  scarcely keep still long enough for him to find it, up came the landlord  and caught him by the sleeve.    \"See here, master,\" said he, \"thou hasn't paid for thy score--where's  thy money?\"    \"Haven't any!\" said the fool, and pulled out his pockets to show they  were empty.    \"What!\" said the landlord, and swore; \"thou 'st drunk all my liquor and  haven't got nought to pay for it with!\"    \"Hi!\" said the fool. \"You told me to drink so as to get a coat o' clay;  but as I'm a wise man now I don't mind helping thee along in the world  a bit, for though I'm a smart fellow I'm not too proud to my friends.\"    \"Wise man! smart fellow!\" said the landlord, \"and help me along, wilt  thee? Dang it! thou 'rt the biggest fool I ever saw, and it's I'll help  _thee_ first--out o' this!\"    And he kicked him out of the door into the road and swore at him.    \"Hum,\" said the fool, as he lay in the dust, \"I'm not so wise as I  thought. I guess I'll go back to the wise woman and tell her there's a  screw loose somewhere.\"    So up he got and went along to her house, and found her sitting at the  door.    \"So thou 'rt come back,\" said she, with a nod. \"What dost thou want with  me now?\"    So he sat down and told her how he'd tried to get a coat o' clay, and he  wasn't any wiser for all of it.    \"No,\" said the wise woman, \"thou 'rt a bigger fool than ever, my lad.\"    \"So they all say,\" sighed the fool; \"but where can I get the right sort  of coat o' clay, then, missis?\"    \"When thou 'rt done with this world, and thy folk put thee in the  ground,\" said the wise woman. \"That's the only coat o' clay as 'll make  such as _thee_ wise, lad. Born a fool, die a fool, and be a fool thy  life long, and that's the truth!\"    And she went into the house and shut the door.    \"Dang it,\" said the fool. \"I must tell my mother she was right after  all, and that she'll never have a wise man for a son!\"    And he went off home.          The Three Cows      There was a farmer, and he had three cows, fine fat beauties they were.  One was called Facey, the other Diamond, and the third Beauty. One  morning he went into his cowshed, and there he found Facey so thin that  the wind would have blown her away. Her skin hung loose about her, all  her flesh was gone, and she stared out of her great eyes as though she'd  seen a ghost; and what was more, the fireplace in the kitchen was one  great pile of wood-ash. Well, he was bothered with it; he could not see  how all this had come about.    Next morning his wife went out to the shed, and see! Diamond was for all  the world as wisht a looking creature as Facey--nothing but a bag of  bones, all the flesh gone, and half a rick of wood was gone too; but the  fireplace was piled up three feet high with white wood-ashes. The farmer  determined to watch the third night; so he hid in a closet which opened  out of the parlour, and he left the door just ajar, that he might see  what passed.    Tick, tick, went the clock, and the farmer was nearly tired of waiting;  he had to bite his little finger to keep himself awake, when suddenly  the door of his house flew open, and in rushed maybe a thousand pixies,  laughing and dancing and dragging at Beauty's halter till they had  brought the cow into the middle of the room. The farmer really thought  he should have died with fright, and so perhaps he would had not  curiosity kept him alive.    Tick, tick, went the clock, but he did not hear it now. He was too  intent staring at the pixies and his last beautiful cow. He saw them  throw her down, fall on her, and kill her; then with their knives they  ripped her open, and flayed her as clean as a whistle. Then out ran some  of the little people and brought in firewood and made a roaring blaze on  the hearth, and there they cooked the flesh of the cow--they baked and  they boiled, they stewed and they fried.    \"Take care,\" cried one, who seemed to be the king, \"let no bone be  broken.\"    Well, when they had all eaten, and had devoured every scrap of beef on  the cow, they began playing games with the bones, tossing them one to  another. One little leg-bone fell close to the closet door, and the  farmer was so afraid lest the pixies should come there and find him in  their search for the bone, that he put out his hand and drew it in to  him. Then he saw the king stand on the table and say, \"Gather the  bones!\"    Round and round flew the imps, picking up the bones. \"Arrange them,\"  said the king; and they placed them all in their proper positions in the  hide of the cow. Then they folded the skin over them, and the king  struck the heap of bone and skin with his rod. Whisht! up sprang the cow  and lowed dismally. It was alive again; but, alas! as the pixies dragged  it back to its stall, it halted in the off forefoot, for a bone was  missing.         \"The cock crew,        Away they flew.\"    and the farmer crept trembling to bed.          The Blinded Giant      At Dalton, near Thirsk, in Yorkshire, there is a mill. It has quite  recently been rebuilt; but when I was at Dalton, six years ago, the old  building stood. In front of the house was a long mound which went by the  name of \"the giant's grave,\" and in the mill you can see a long blade of  iron something like a scythe-blade, but not curved, which was called  \"the giant's knife,\" because of a very curious story which is told of  this knife. Would you like to hear it? Well, it isn't very long.    There once lived a giant at this mill who had only one eye in the middle  of his forehead, and he ground men's bones to make his bread. One day he  captured on Pilmoor a lad named Jack, and instead of grinding him in the  mill he kept him grinding as his servant, and never let him get away.  Jack served the giant seven years, and never was allowed a holiday the  whole time. At last he could bear it no longer. Topcliffe fair was  coming on, and Jack begged that he might be allowed to go there.    \"No, no,\" said the giant, \"stop at home and mind your grinding.\"    \"I've been grinding and grinding these seven years,\" said Jack, \"and not  a holiday have I had. I'll have one now, whatever you say.\"    \"We'll see about that,\" said the giant.    Well, the day was hot, and after dinner the giant lay down in the mill  with his head on a sack and dozed. He had been eating in the mill, and  had laid down a great loaf of bone bread by his side, and the knife I  told you about was in his hand, but his fingers relaxed their hold of it  in sleep. Jack seized the knife, and holding it with both his hands  drove the blade into the single eye of the giant, who woke with a howl  of agony, and starting up, barred the door. Jack was again in  difficulties, for he couldn't get out, but he soon found a way out of  them. The giant had a favourite dog, which had also been sleeping when  his master was blinded. So Jack killed the dog, skinned it, and threw  the hide over his back.    \"Bow, wow,\" says Jack.    \"At him, Truncheon,\" said the giant; \"at the little wretch that I've fed  these seven years, and now has blinded me.\"    \"Bow, wow,\" says Jack, and ran between the giant's legs on all-fours,  barking till he got to the door. He unlatched it and was off, and never  more was seen at Dalton Mill.          Scrapefoot      Once upon a time, there were three Bears who lived in a castle in a  great wood. One of them was a great big Bear, and one was a middling  Bear, and one was a little Bear. And in the same wood there was a Fox  who lived all alone, his name was Scrapefoot. Scrapefoot was very much  afraid of the Bears, but for all that he wanted very much to know all  about them. And one day as he went through the wood he found himself  near the Bears' Castle, and he wondered whether he could get into the  castle. He looked all about him everywhere, and he could not see any  one. So he came up very quietly, till at last he came up to the door of  the castle, and he tried whether he could open it. Yes! the door was not  locked, and he opened it just a little way, and put his nose in and  looked, and he could not see any one. So then he opened it a little way  farther, and put one paw in, and then another paw, and another and  another, and then he was all in the Bears' Castle. He found he was in a  great hall with three chairs in it--one big, one middling, and one  little chair; and he thought he would like to sit down and rest and  look about him; so he sat down on the big chair. But he found it so hard  and uncomfortable that it made his bones ache, and he jumped down at  once and got into the middling chair, and he turned round and round in  it, but he couldn't make himself comfortable. So then he went to the  little chair and sat down in it, and it was so soft and warm and  comfortable that Scrapefoot was quite happy; but all at once it broke to  pieces under him and he couldn't put it together again! So he got up and  began to look about him again, and on one table he saw three saucers, of  which one was very big, one was middling, one was quite a little saucer.  Scrapefoot was very thirsty, and he began to drink out of the big  saucer. But he only just tasted the milk in the big saucer, which was so  sour and so nasty that he would not taste another drop of it. Then he  tried the middling saucer, and he drank a little of that. He tried two  or three mouthfuls, but it was not nice, and then he left it and went to  the little saucer, and the milk in the little saucer was so sweet and so  nice that he went on drinking it till it was all gone.    Then Scrapefoot thought he would like to go upstairs; and he listened  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#12)"],[1,"the other hand the figures are often  felt to move.    Pictures are blamed for being conventional when it is lack of vitality  that is the trouble. If the convention adopted has not been vitalised by  the emotion that is the reason of the painting, it will, of course, be a  lifeless affair. But however abstract and unnaturalistic the manner  adopted, if it has been truly felt by the artist as the right means of  expressing his emotional idea, it will have life and should not be  called conventional in the commonly accepted offensive use of the term.    It is only when a painter consciously chooses a manner not his own,  which he does not comprehend and is incapable of firing with his own  personality, that his picture is ridiculous and conventional in the dead  sense.    But every age differs in its temperament, and the artistic conventions  of one age seldom fit another. The artist has to discover a convention  for himself, one that fits his particular individuality. But this is  done simply and naturally--not by starting out with the intention of  flouting all traditional conventions on principle; nor, on the other  hand, by accepting them all on principle, but by simply following his  own bent and selecting what appeals to him in anything and everything  that comes within the range of his vision. The result is likely to be  something very different from the violent exploits in peculiarity that  have been masquerading as originality lately. #Originality is more  concerned with sincerity than with peculiarity.#    The struggling and fretting after originality that one sees in modern  art is certainly an evidence of vitality, but one is inclined to doubt  whether anything really original was ever done in so forced a way. The  older masters, it seems, were content sincerely to try and do the best  they were capable of doing. And this continual striving to do better led  them almost unconsciously to new and original results. Originality is a  quality over which an artist has as little influence as over the shape  and distinction of his features. All he can do is to be sincere and try  and find out the things that really move him and that he really likes.  If he has a strong and original character, he will have no difficulty in  this, and his work will be original in the true sense. And if he has  not, it is a matter of opinion whether he is not better employed in  working along the lines of some well-tried manner that will at any rate  keep him from doing anything really bad, than in struggling to cloak his  own commonplaceness under violent essays in peculiarity and the  avoidance of the obvious at all costs.    But while speaking against fretting after eccentricity, don't let it be  assumed that any discouragement is being given to genuine new points of  view. In art, when a thing has once been well done and has found  embodiment in some complete work of art, it has been done once for all.  The circumstances that produced it are never likely to occur again. That  is why those painters who continue to reproduce a picture of theirs (we  do not mean literally) that had been a success in the first instance,  never afterwards obtain the success of the original performance. Every  beautiful work of art is a new creation, the result of particular  circumstances in the life of the artist and the time of its production,  that have never existed before and will never recur again. Were any of  the great masters of the past alive now, they would do very different  work from what they did then, the circumstances being so entirely  different. So that should anybody seek to paint like Titian now, by  trying to paint like Titian did in his time, he could not attempt  anything more unlike the spirit of that master; which in its day, like  the spirit of all masters, was most advanced. But it is only by a  scrupulously sincere and truthful attitude of mind that the new and  original circumstances in which we find ourselves can be taken advantage  of for the production of original work. And self-conscious seeking after  peculiarity only stops the natural evolution and produces abortions.    But do not be frightened by conventions, the different materials in  which the artist works impose their conventions. And as it is through  these materials that he has to find expression, what expressive  qualities they possess must be studied, and those facts in nature  selected that are in harmony with them. The treatment of hair by  sculptors is an extreme instance of this. What are those qualities of  hair that are amenable to expression in stone? Obviously they are few,  and confined chiefly to the mass forms in which the hair arranges  itself. The finest sculptors have never attempted more than this, have  never lost sight of the fact that it was stone they were working with,  and never made any attempt to create an illusion of real hair. And in  the same way, when working in bronze, the fine artist never loses sight  of the fact that it is bronze with which he is working. How sadly the  distinguished painter to whom a misguided administration entrusted the  work of modelling the British emblem overlooked this, may be seen any  day in Trafalgar Square, the lions there possessing none of the  splendour of bronze but looking as if they were modelled in dough, and  possessing in consequence none of the vital qualities of the lion. It is  interesting to compare them with the little lion Alfred Stevens modelled  for the railing of the British Museum, and to speculate on what a thrill  we might have received every time we passed Trafalgar Square, had he  been entrusted with the work, as he might have been.    And in painting, the great painters never lose sight of the fact that it  is paint with which they are expressing themselves. And although paint  is capable of approaching much nearer an actual illusory appearance of  nature than stone or bronze, they never push this to the point where you  forget that it is paint. This has been left for some of the smaller men.    And when it comes to drawing, the great artists have always confined  themselves to the qualities in nature that the tool they were drawing  with was capable of expressing, and no others. Whether working with pen,  pencil, chalk, or charcoal, they always created a convention within  which unlimited expression has been possible.    To sum up, academic drawing is all that can be really taught, and is as  necessary to the painter as the practising of exercises is to the  musician, that his powers of observation and execution may be trained.  But the vital matter of art is not in all this necessary training. And  this fact the student should always keep in mind, and be ever ready to  give rein to those natural enthusiasms which, if he is an artist, he  will find welling up within him. The danger is that the absorbing  interest in his academic studies may take up his whole attention, to the  neglect of the instinctive qualities that he should possess the  possession of which alone will entitle him to be an artist.          VII    THE STUDY OF DRAWING      We have seen that there are two extreme points of view from which the  representation of form can be approached, that of outline directly  related to the mental idea of form with its touch association on the one  hand, and that of mass connected directly with the visual picture on the  retina on the other.    Now, between these two extreme points of view there are an infinite  variety of styles combining them both and leaning more to the one side  or the other, as the case may be. But it is advisable for the student to  study both separately, for there are different things to be learnt and  different expressive qualities in nature to be studied in both.    From the study of outline drawing the eye is trained to accurate  observation and learns the expressive value of a line. And the hand is  also trained to definite statement, the student being led on by degrees  from simple outlines to approach the full realisation of form in all the  complexity of light and shade.    But at the same time he should study mass drawing with paint from the  purely visual point of view, in order to be introduced to the important  study of tone values and the expression of form by means of planes. And  so by degrees he will learn accurately to observe and portray the tone  masses (their shapes and values) to which all visual appearances can be  reduced; and he will gradually arrive at the full realisation of form--a  realisation that will bring him to a point somewhat similar to that  arrived at from the opposite point of view of an outline to which has  been added light and shade, &c.    But unless both points of view are studied, the student's work will be  incomplete. If form be studied only from the outline point of view, and  what have been called sculptor's drawings alone attempted, the student  will lack knowledge of the tone and atmosphere that always envelop form  in nature. And also he will be poorly equipped when he comes to exchange  the pencil for a brush and endeavours to express himself in paint.    And if his studies be only from the mass point of view, the training of  his eye to the accurate observation of all the subtleties of contours  and the construction of form will be neglected. And he will not  understand the mental form stimulus that the direction and swing of a  brush stroke can give. These and many things connected with expression  can best be studied in line work.    Let the student therefore begin on the principles adopted in most  schools, with outline studies of simple casts or models, and gradually  add light and shade. When he has acquired more proficiency he may  approach drawing from the life. This is sufficiently well done in the  numerous schools of art that now exist all over the country. But, at the  same time (and this, as far as I know, is not done anywhere), the  student should begin some simple form of"]]]
