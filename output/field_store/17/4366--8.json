[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16435"],[0,"The Atlantic Book of Modern Plays (#12)"],[1," My dear  one. Forgive me if I made it difficult for you, if I said cruel  words. I ought to have guessed; ought to have seen what life has  done to you. (_He looks up, not understanding her words_). Those  hands of yours first dug a living out of the ground. Then they  built houses and grew strong because you were a workman--a man of  the people. You saw injustice, and all your life you fought  against those who had the power to inflict it: the press; the  comfortable respectables, like my brother; and even those of your  own group who opposed you--you fought them all. And they look at  you as an outsider, an alien in your own country. O Will, I know  how hard it has been for you to be always on the defensive,  against the majority. It is hard to live alone, away from the  herd. It does tire one to the bone and make one envious of the  comfort and security they find by being together.    WHITE. Yes--but--    HILDA. Now the war comes and with it a chance to get back; to be  part of the majority; to be welcomed with open arms by those who  have fought you; to go back with honor and praise. And, yes, to  have the warmth and comfort of the crowd. That's the real reason  you're going in. You're tired and worn out with the fight. I  know. I understand now.    WHITE (_earnestly_). If I thought it was that, I'd kill myself.    HILDA. There's been enough killing already. I have to understand  it somehow to accept it at all.    (_He stares at her, wondering at her words. She smiles. He goes to  a chair and sits down, gazing before him. The music of Over There  is now heard outside in the street, approaching nearer and  nearer. It is a military band. WALLACE excitedly rushes in  dressed in khaki._)    WALLACE. Mother, mother. The boys are coming down the street.  (_Sees father._) Dad! Mother has told you?    HILDA (_calmly_). Yes; I've told him.    WALLACE. And you're going to let me go, Dad?    HILDA. Yes.    WALLACE. Oh, thanks, Dad (_grasping his hand_).    I knew mother would make you see. (_Music nearer._) Listen! Isn't  that a great tune? Lifts you up on your feet and carries you over  there. Gee, it just gets into a fellow and makes him want to run  for his gun and charge over the top. (_He goes to balcony._) Look!  They're nearing here; all ready to sail with the morning tide.  They've got their helmets on. You can't see the end of them  coming down the avenue. Oh, thank God, I'm going to be one of  them soon. Thank God! I'm going to fight for Uncle Sam and the  Stars and Stripes. (_Calls off_) Hurrah! (_To them_) Oh, I wish I had  a flag. Why haven't we got a flag here?--Hurrah!!    (_As he goes out on the balcony the music plays louder. HILDA has  gone to WHITE during this, and stands behind him, with her arms  down his arms, as he sits there, gazing before him._)    HILDA (_fervently_). Oh, Will, if I could only feel it as he does!!    (_The music begins to trail off as WHITE tenderly takes hold of  her hands._)                            [CURTAIN]          ILE    Eugene O'Neill      SCENE: CAPTAIN KEENEY'S cabin on board the steam whaling ship  Atlantic Queen--a small, square compartment, about eight feet  high, with a skylight in the centre looking out on the poop deck.  On the left (_the stern of the ship_) a long bench with rough  cushions is built in against the wall. In front of the bench, a  table. Over the bench, several curtained portholes.    In the rear, left, a door leading to the captain's  sleeping-quarters. To the right of the door a small organ,  looking as if it were brand-new, is placed against the wall.    On the right, to the rear, a marble-topped, sideboard. On the  sideboard, a woman's sewing-basket. Farther forward, a doorway  leading to the companion way, and past the officers' quarters to  the main deck.    In the centre of the room, a stove. From the middle of the  ceiling a hanging lamp is suspended. The walls of the cabin are  painted white.    There is no rolling of the ship, and the light which comes  through the skylight is sickly and faint, indicating one of those  gray days of calm when ocean and sky are alike dead. The silence  is unbroken except for the measured tread of someone walking up  and down on the poop deck overhead.    It is nearing two bells--one o'clock--in the afternoon of a day  in the year 1895.    At the rise of the curtain there is a moment of intense silence.  Then the STEWARD enters and commences to clear the table of the  few dishes which still remain on it after the CAPTAIN'S dinner.  He is an old, grizzled man dressed in dungaree pants, a sweater,  and a woolen cap with ear-flaps. His manner is sullen and angry.  He stops stacking up the plates and casts a quick glance upward  at the skylight; then tiptoes over to the closed door in rear and  listens with his ear pressed to the crack. What he hears makes  his face darken and he mutters a furious curse. There is a noise  from the doorway on the right, and he darts back to the table.    BEN enters. He is an over-grown, gawky boy with a long, pinched  face. He is dressed in sweater, fur cap, etc. His teeth are  chattering with the cold and he hurries to the stove, where he  stands for a moment shivering, blowing on his hands, slapping  them against his sides, on the verge of crying.    THE STEWARD (_in relieved tones--seeing who it is_). Oh, 'tis you,  is it? What're ye shiverin' 'bout? Stay by the stove where ye  belong and ye'll find no need of chatterin'.    BEN. It's c-c-old. (_Trying to control his chattering  teeth--derisively_) Who d' ye think it were--the Old Man?    THE STEWARD. (_He makes a threatening move--BEN shrinks away._)  None o' your lip, young un, or I'll learn ye. (_More kindly_) Where  was it ye've been all o' the time--the fo'c's'le?    BEN. Yes.    THE STEWARD. Let the Old Man see ye up for'ard monkey-shinin'  with the handstand ye'll get a hidin' ye'll not forget in a  hurry.    BEN. Aw, he don't see nothin'. (_A trace of awe in his tones--he  glances upward._) He just walks up and down like he didn't notice  nobody--and stares at the ice to the no'th'ard.    THE STEWARD (_the same tone of awe creeping into his voice_). He's  always starin' at the ice. (_In a sudden rage, shaking his fist at  the skylight_) Ice, ice, ice! Damn him and damn the ice! Holdin'  us in for nigh on a year--nothin' to see but ice--stuck in it  like a fly in molasses!    BEN (_apprehensively_). Ssshh! He'll hear ye.    THE STEWARD (_raging_). Aye, damn him, and damn the Arctic seas,  and damn this stinkin' whalin' ship of his, and damn me for a  fool to ever ship on it! (_Subsiding, as if realizing the  uselessness of this outburst--shaking his head--slowly, with deep  conviction_) He's a hard man--as hard a man as ever sailed the  seas.    BEN (_solemnly_). Aye.    THE STEWARD. The two years we all signed up for are done this  day. Blessed Christ! Two years o' this dog's life, and no luck in  the fishin', and the hands half starved with the food runnin'  low, rotten as it is; and not a sign of him turnin' back for  home! (_Bitterly_) Home! I begin to doubt if ever I'll set foot on  land again. (_Excitedly_) What is it he thinks he's goin' to do?  Keep us all up here after our time is worked out till the last  man of us is starved to death or frozen? We've grub enough hardly  to last out the voyage back if we started now. What are the men  goin' to do 'bout it? Did ye hear any talk in the fo'c's'le?    BEN (_going over to him--in a half-whisper_). They said if he don't  put back south for home to-day they're goin' to mutiny.    THE STEWARD (_with grim satisfaction_). Mutiny? Aye, 'tis the only  thing they can do; and serve him right after the manner he's  treated them--'s if they weren't no better nor dogs.    BEN. The ice is all broke up to s'uth'rd. They's clear water's  far's you can see. He ain't got no excuse for not turnin' back  for home, the men says.    THE STEWARD (_bitterly_). He won't look nowheres but no'th'rd where  they's only the ice to see. He don't want to see no clear water.  All he thinks on is gittin' the ile--'s if it was our fault he  ain't had good luck with the whales. (_Shaking his head_) I think  the man's mighty nigh losin' his senses.    BEN (_awed_). D' you really think he's crazy?    THE STEWARD. Aye, it's the punishment o' God on him. Did ye hear  ever of a man who wasn't crazy do the things he does? (_Pointing  to the door in rear_) Who but a man that's mad would take his  woman--and as sweet a woman as ever was--on a stinkin' whalin'  ship to the Arctic seas to be locked in by the rotten ice for  nigh on a year, and maybe lose her senses forever--for it's sure  she'll never be the same again.    BEN (_sadly_). She useter be awful nice to me before--(_his eyes  grow wide and frightened_) she got--like she is.    THE STEWARD. Aye, she was good to all of us. 'T would have been  hell on board without her; for he's a hard man--a hard, hard  man--a driver if there ever was one. (_With a grim laugh_) I hope  he's satisfied now--drivin' her on till she's near lost her mind.  And who could blame her? 'T is a God's wonder we're not a ship  full of crazed people--with the damned ice all the time, and the  quiet so thick you're afraid to hear your own voice.    BEN (_with a frightened glance toward the door on right_). She  don't never speak to me no more--jest looks at me's if she didn't  know me.    THE STEWARD. She don't know no one--but him. She talks to  him--when she does talk--right enough.    BEN. She does nothin' all day long now but sit and sew--and then  she cries to herself without makin' no noise. I've seen her.    THE STEWARD. Aye, I could hear her through the door a while back.    BEN (_tiptoes over to the door and listens_). She's cryin' now.    THE STEWARD (_furiously--shaking his fist_). God send his soul to  hell for the devil he is!    (_There is the noise of someone coming slowly down the  companionway stairs._ THE STEWARD _hurries to his stacked-up  dishes. He is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#12)"],[1,"slowly, and the scum and dross go all to one side, the other remaining  clear. When you take it off, let none of the liquor go away with the dross.  3. When you take it from the fire, let it settle well, before it be tunned  into the vessel, wherein you mean to keep it: and when it comes near the  bottom, let it be taken carefully from the sediment, with a thin Dish, so  as nothing be put into the vessel, but what is clear. 4. Stop it very  close (when it is set in the place, where it must remain) cover it with a  cloth, upon which some handfuls of Bay-salt and Salpeter is laid, and over  that lay clay, and a Turf. 5. Put into it, when you stop it, some  New-laid-eggs in number proportionable to the bigness of the vessel,  Shell's unbroken. Six Eggs to about sixteen Gallons. The whole Egg-shell  and all will be entirely consumed.      METHEGLIN FOR TASTE AND COLOUR    Must be boiled as the other, if you intend to keep it above half a year;  but less according to the time, wherein you mean to use it. You must put in  no Herbs, to avoid bitterness and discolouring; and the proportion of water  and honey more or less, as you would drink it sooner or later; (as a Gallon  of honey to 4, 5, or 6 of water.) If to be weak, and to be soon drunk, you  must when it is tunned, put in a Tost of bread (hard tosted) upon which  half a score drops of Spirit of yest or barm is dropped; for want of it,  spread it with purest barm beaten with a few drops of Oyl of Cinnamon. If  you intend to give it the taste of Raspes, then adde more barm, to make it  work well, and during that time of working, put in your Raspes (or their  Syrup) but the fruit gives a delicate Colour, and Syrup a duller Tincture.  Drink not that made after the first manner, till six moneths, and it will  endure drawing better then wine; but Bottleled, it is more spirited then  any drink.    The Spirit of Barm is made by putting store of water to the barm; then  distill the Spirit, as you do other Spirits; At last an oyl will come,  which is not for this use.    Sir Thomas Gower maketh his ordinary drink thus: Make very small well  Brewed Ale. To eight Gallons of this put one Gallon of honey; when it is  well dissolved and clarified, tun up the Liquor, making it work in due  manner with barm. When it hath done working, stop it up close, and in three  months it will be fit to drink.    He makes Metheglin thus. Make a good Decoct of Eglantine-leaves, Cowslip  flowers, a little Sweet-marjoram, and some Rosemary and Bay-leaves, Betony,  and Scabious, and a little Thyme. After the sediment hath settled, put 1/3  or 1/4 or 1/5 or 1/6 part of honey, (according as you would have it strong,  and soon ready) to the clear severed from the settlement, and stir it  exceeding well with stripped arms 4 or 5 hours, till it be perfectly  incorporated. Then boil and scum it; let it then cool and tun it up, &c.  After it hath cooled, lade the clean from the settlement, so that it may  not trouble it, and run up the clear thus severed from the settlings. Much  of the perfection consisteth in stirring it long with stripped arms before  you boil it. Then to boil it very leisurely till all the scum be off. And  order your fire so, that the scum may rise and drive all to one side. This  will be exceeding pale clear and pleasant Metheglin. He useth to every  Gallon of water, a good handful of Eglantine-leaves, and as much Cowslip  flowers; but onely a Pugil of Thyme or Marjoram.      AN EXCELLENT WAY OF MAKING WHITE METHEGLIN    Take of Sweet-bryar berries, of Rosemary, broad Thyme, of each a handful.  Boil them in a quantity of fair water for half an hour; then cleanse the  water from the herbs, and let it stand 24 hours, until it be thorough cold.  Then put your hony into it (hony which floweth from the Combs of it self in  a warm place is best) make it so strong of the honey that it bear an egge  (if you will have it strong) the breadth of a groat above the Liquor. This  being done, lave and bounce it very well and often, that the honey and  water may incorporate and work well together. After this boil it softly  over a gentle fire, and scum it. Then beat the whites of eggs with their  shells, and put into it to clarifie it. After this, put some of it into a  vessel, and take the whites of two eggs, and a little barm, and a small  quantity of fine flower; beat them well together, and put it into the  vessel close covered, that it may work. Then pour the rest into it by  degrees, as you do Beer. At last take a quantity of Cinamon, 2 or 3 races  of Ginger, and two Nutmegs (for more will alter the colour of it.) Hang  these in a little bag in the vessel. Thus made, it will be as white as any  White-wine.      ANOTHER WAY OF MAKING WHITE METHEGLIN    To three Gallons of Spring-water take three quarts of honey, and set it  over the fire, till the scum rises pretty thick. Then take off the scum,  and put in Thyme, Rosemary, Hyssop and Maiden-hair, of each one handful;  and two handfuls of Eglantine leaves, and half a handful of Organ. The  spices, Ginger, Nutmegs, Cinamon and a little mace, and boil all these  together near half an hour. Then take it from the fire, and let it stand  till it be cold, and then strain it, and so Tun it up, and stop it close.  The longer you keep it, the better it will be.      ANOTHER WAY    Take two Gallons of water; one Gallon of Honey: Parietary one handful;  Sage, Thyme, one Pugil; Of Hyssop half a Pugil. Six Parsley-roots; one  Fennel-root, the pith taken out: Red-nettles one Pugil. Six leaves of  Hearts-tongue. Boil this together one hour. Then put in the Honey, and  Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace, Cinamon of each one ounce; of Ginger three ounces.  Boil all these together, till the scum be boiled in, not scumming it. Then  take it off, and set it to cool. When it is cold, put in it six spoonfuls  of barm, and when it is ripe, it will hiss in the pail. You must take out  the herbs, when you put in the honey. If you put in these herbs following,  it will be far better; Sanicle, Bugloss, Avens, and Ladies-mantle, of each  one handful.      TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN    Take of Sweet-bryar a great handful: of Violet-flowers, Sweet-marjoram,  Strawberry-leaves, Violet-leaves, _ana_, one handful, Agrimony, Bugloss,  Borrage, _ana_, half a handful. Rosemary four branches, Gilly-flowers, No.  4 (the Yellow-wall-flowers, with great tops) Anniseeds, Fennel, and  Caraway, of each a spoonful, Two large Mace. Boil all these in twelve  Gallons of water for the Space of an hour; then strain it, and let it stand  until it be Milk-warm Then put in as much honey, as will carry an Egge to  the breadth of sixpence, at least. Then boil it again, and scum it clean;  then let it stand, until it be cold; then put a pint of Ale-barm into it,  and ripen it as you do Beer, and tun it. Then hang in the midst of the  vessel a little bag with a Nutmeg quartered, a Race of Ginger sliced, a  little Cinamon, and mace whole, and three grains of Musk in a cloth put  into the bag amongst the rest of the Spices. Put a stone in the bag, to  keep it in the midst of the Liquor. This quantity took up three Gallons of  honey; therefore be sure to have four in readiness.      STRONG MEAD    Take one Measure of honey, and dissolve it in four of water, beating it  long up and down with clean Woodden ladels. The next day boil it gently,  scumming it all the while till no more scum riseth; and if you will  clarifie the Liquor with a few beaten whites of Eggs, it will be the  clearer. The rule of it's being boiled enough is, when it yieldeth no more  scum, and beareth an Egge, so that the breadth of a groat is out of the  water. Then pour it out of the Kettle into woodden vessels, and let it  remain there till it be almost cold. Then Tun it into a vessel, where Sack  hath been.      A RECEIPT FOR MAKING OF MEATH    Take a quart of honey, and mix it with a Gallon of Fountain-water, and work  it well four days together, four times a day; The fifth day put it over  the fire, and let it boil an hour, and scum it well. Then take the whites  of two Eggs, and beat them to a froth, and put it into the Liquor; stirring  it well, till the whites of Eggs have raised a froth of Scum; then take it  off, scumming the liquor clean. Then take a handful of Strawberry-leaves  and Violet-leaves together, with a little Sprig of Rosemary and two or  three little Sprigs of Spike; and so boil it again (with these herbs in it)  a quarter of an hour. Then take it off the fire, and when it is cold, put  it into a little barrel, and put into it half a spoonful of Ale-yest, and  let it work; which done, take one Nutmeg sliced, and twice as much Ginger  sliced, six Cloves bruised, and a little stick of Cinamon, and sow these  Spices in a little bag, and stop it well; and it will be fit for use within  a fortnight, and will last half a year. If you will have your Metheglin  stronger, put into it a greater quantity of honey.      MY LORD HOLLIS HYDROMEL    In four parts of Springwater dissolve one part of honey, or so much as the  Liquor will bear an Egge to the breadth of a Groat. Then boil it very well,  and that all the scum be taken away. He addeth nothing to it but a small  proportion of Ginger sliced: of which He putteth half to boil in the  Liquor, after all the scum is gone; and the other half He putteth into a  bag, and hangeth in the bung, when it is tunned. The Ginger must be very  little, not so much as to make the Liquor taste strongly of it, but to  quicken it. I should like to adde a little proportion of Rosemary, and a  greater of Sweet-bryar leaves, in the boiling. As also, to put into the  barrel a tost of white bread with mustard, to make it work. He puts nothing  to it; but his own strength in time makes it work of it self. It is good to  drink after a year.      A RECEIPT FOR WHITE METHEGLIN    Take to every quart of honey, 4, 5, or 6, quarts of water; boil it on a  good quick fire as long as any scum riseth; as"]]]
