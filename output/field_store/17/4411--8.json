Water can be had only from the public pumps, and the difficulty of     obtaining it naturally fosters all possible filth.\"    In the other great seaport towns the prospect is no better.  Liverpool,  with all its commerce, wealth, and grandeur yet treats its workers with  the same barbarity.  A full fifth of the population, more than 45,000  human beings, live in narrow, dark, damp, badly-ventilated cellar  dwellings, of which there are 7,862 in the city.  Besides these cellar  dwellings there are 2,270 courts, small spaces built up on all four sides  and having but one entrance, a narrow, covered passage-way, the whole  ordinarily very dirty and inhabited exclusively by proletarians.  Of such  courts we shall have more to say when we come to Manchester.  In Bristol,  on one occasion, 2,800 families were visited, of whom 46 per cent.  occupied but one room each.    Precisely the same state of things prevails in the factory towns.  In  Nottingham there are in all 11,000 houses, of which between 7,000 and  8,000 are built back to back with a rear parti-wall so that no through  ventilation is possible, while a single privy usually serves for several  houses.  During an investigation made a short time since, many rows of  houses were found to have been built over shallow drains covered only by  the boards of the ground floor.  In Leicester, Derby, and Sheffield, it  is no better.  Of Birmingham, the article above cited from the _Artisan_  states:       \"In the older quarters of the city there are many bad districts,     filthy and neglected, full of stagnant pools and heaps of refuse.     Courts are very numerous in Birmingham, reaching two thousand, and     containing the greater number of the working-people of the city.  These     courts are usually narrow, muddy, badly ventilated, ill-drained, and     lined with eight to twenty houses, which, by reason of having their     rear walls in common, can usually be ventilated from one side only.  In     the background, within the court, there is usually an ash heap or     something of the kind, the filth of which cannot be described.  It     must, however, be observed that the newer courts are more sensibly     built and more decently kept, and that even in the old ones, the     cottages are much less crowded than in Manchester and Liverpool,     wherefore Birmingham shows even during the reign of an epidemic a far     smaller mortality than, for instance, Wolverhampton, Dudley, and     Bilston, only a few miles distant.  Cellar dwellings are unknown, too,     in Birmingham, though a few cellars are misused as workrooms.  The     lodging-houses for proletarians are rather numerous (over four     hundred), chiefly in courts in the heart of the town.  They are nearly     all disgustingly filthy and ill-smelling, the refuge of beggars,     thieves, tramps, and prostitutes, who eat, drink, smoke, and sleep     here without the slightest regard to comfort or decency in an     atmosphere endurable to these degraded beings only.\"    Glasgow is in many respects similar to Edinburgh, possessing the same  wynds, the same tall houses.  Of this city the _Artisan_ observes:       \"The working-class forms here some 78% of the whole population (about     300,000), and lives in parts of the city which exceed in wretchedness     and squalor the lowest nooks of St. Giles and Whitechapel, the     Liberties of Dublin, the Wynds of Edinburgh.  There are numbers of     such localities in the heart of the city, south of the Trongate,     westward from the Saltmarket, in Calton and off the High Street,     endless labyrinths of lanes or wynds into which open at almost every     step, courts or blind alleys, formed by ill-ventilated, high-piled,     waterless, and dilapidated houses.  These are literally swarming with     inhabitants.  They contain three or four families upon each floor,     perhaps twenty persons.  In some cases each storey is let out in     sleeping places, so that fifteen to twenty persons are packed, one on     top of the other, I cannot say accommodated, in a single room.  These     districts shelter the poorest, most depraved, and worthless members of     the community, and may be regarded as the sources of those frightful     epidemics which, beginning here, spread desolation over Glasgow.\"    Let us hear how J. C. Symonds, Government Commissioner for the  investigation of the condition of the hand-weavers, describes these  portions of the city: {38}       \"I have seen wretchedness in some of its worse phases both here and     upon the Continent, but until I visited the wynds of Glasgow I did not     believe that so much crime, misery, and disease could exist in any     civilised country.  In the lower lodging-houses ten, twelve, sometimes     twenty persons of both sexes, all ages and various degrees of     nakedness, sleep indiscriminately huddled together upon the floor.     These dwellings are usually so damp, filthy, and ruinous, that no one     could wish to keep his horse in one of them.\"    And in another place:       \"The wynds of Glasgow contain a fluctuating population of fifteen to     thirty thousand human beings.  This quarter consists wholly of narrow     alleys and square courts, in the middle of every one of which there     lies a dung heap.  Revolting as was the outward appearance of these     courts, I was yet not prepared for the filth and wretchedness within.     In some of the sleeping-places which we visited at night (the     Superintendent of Police, Captain Miller, and Symonds) we found a     complete layer of human beings stretched upon the floor, often fifteen     to twenty, some clad, others naked, men and women indiscriminately.     Their bed was a litter of mouldy straw, mixed with rags.  There was     little or no furniture, and the only thing which gave these dens any     shimmer of habitableness was a fire upon the hearth.  Theft and     prostitution form the chief means of subsistence of this population.     No one seemed to take the trouble to cleanse this Augean stable, this     Pandemonium, this tangle of crime, filth, and pestilence in the centre     of the second city of the kingdom.  An extended examination of the     lowest districts of other cities never revealed anything half so bad,     either in intensity of moral and physical infection, nor in     comparative density of population.  In this quarter most of the houses     have been declared by the Court of Guild ruinous and unfit for     habitation, but precisely these are the most densely populated,     because, according to the law, no rent can be demanded for them.\"    The great manufacturing district in the centre of the British Islands,  the thickly peopled stretch of West Yorkshire and South Lancashire, with  its numerous factory towns, yields nothing to the other great  manufacturing centres.  The woollen district of the West Riding of  Yorkshire is a charming region, a beautiful green hill country, whose  elevations grow more rugged towards the West until they reach their  highest point in the bold ridge of Blackstone Edge, the watershed between  the Irish Sea and the German Ocean.  The valleys of the Aire, along which  stretches Leeds, and of the Calder, through which the Manchester-Leeds  railway runs, are among the most attractive in England, and are strewn in  all directions with the factories, villages, and towns.  The houses of  rough grey stone look so neat and clean in comparison with the blackened  brick buildings of Lancashire, that it is a pleasure to look at them.  But  on coming into the towns themselves, one finds little to rejoice over.  Leeds lies as the _Artisan_ describes it, and as I found confirmed upon  examination: \"on a gentle slope that descends into the valley of the  Aire.  This stream flows through the city for about a mile-and-a-half and  is exposed to violent floods during thaws or heavy rain.  The higher  western portions of the city are clean, for such a large town.  But the  low-lying districts along the river and its tributary becks are narrow,  dirty, and enough in themselves to shorten the lives of the inhabitants,  especially of little children.  Added to this, the disgusting state of  the working-men's districts about Kirkgate, Marsh Lane, Cross Street and  Richmond Road, which is chiefly attributable to their unpaved, drainless  streets, irregular architecture, numerous courts and alleys, and total  lack of the most ordinary means of cleanliness, all this taken together  is explanation enough of the excessive mortality in these unhappy abodes  of filthy misery.  In consequence of the overflows of the Aire\" (which,  it must be added, like all other rivers in the service of manufacture,  flows into the city at one end clear and transparent, and flows out at  the other end thick, black, and foul, smelling of all possible refuse),  \"the houses and cellars are often so full of water that they have to be  pumped out.  And at such times the water rises, even where there are  sewers, out of them into cellars, {40a} engenders miasmatic vapours  strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and leaves a disgusting  residuum highly injurious to health.  During the spring-floods of 1839  the action of such a choking of the sewers was so injurious, that,  according to the report of the Registrar of Births and Deaths for this  part of the town, there were three deaths to two births, whereas in the  same three months, in every other part of the town, there were three  births to two deaths.  Other thickly populated districts are without any  sewers whatsoever, or so badly provided as to derive no benefit from  them.  In some rows of houses the cellars are seldom dry; in certain  districts there are several streets covered with soft mud a foot deep.  The inhabitants have made vain attempts from time to time to repair these  streets with shovelfuls of cinders, but in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#12)"],[1,"around this Table which hath been sent down  from heaven. Beware that ye deny not the favour of God after it hath been  sent down unto you. Better is this for you than that which ye possess; for  that which is yours perisheth, whilst that which is with God endureth. He,  in truth, ordaineth what He pleaseth. Verily, the breezes of forgiveness  have been wafted from the direction of your Lord, the God of Mercy; whoso  turneth thereunto shall be cleansed of his sins, and of all pain and  sickness. Happy the man that hath turned towards them, and woe betide him  that hath turned aside.    132 Wert thou to incline thine inner ear unto all created things, thou  wouldst hear: \"The Ancient of Days is come in His great glory!\" Everything  celebrateth the praise of its Lord. Some have known God and remember Him;  others remember Him, yet know Him not. Thus have We set down Our decree in  a perspicuous Tablet.    133 Give ear, O King, unto the Voice that calleth from the Fire which  burneth in this verdant Tree, on this Sinai which hath been raised above  the hallowed and snow-white Spot, beyond the Everlasting City; \"Verily,  there is none other God but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful!\"  We, in truth, have sent Him Whom We aided with the Holy Spirit that He may  announce unto you this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the  Will of your Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and Whose signs  have been revealed in the West. Set your faces towards Him on this Day  which God hath exalted above all other days, and whereon the All-Merciful  hath shed the splendour of His effulgent glory upon all who are in heaven  and all who are on earth. Arise thou to serve God and help His Cause. He,  verily, will assist thee with the hosts of the seen and unseen, and will  set thee king over all that whereon the sun riseth. Thy Lord, in truth, is  the All-Powerful, the Almighty.    134 The breezes of the Most Merciful have passed over all created things;  happy the man that hath discovered their fragrance, and set himself  towards them with a sound heart. Attire thy temple with the ornament of My  Name, and thy tongue with remembrance of Me, and thine heart with love for  Me, the Almighty, the Most High. We have desired for thee naught except  that which is better for thee than what thou dost possess and all the  treasures of the earth. Thy Lord, verily, is knowing, informed of all.  Arise, in My Name, amongst My servants, and say: \"O ye peoples of the  earth! Turn yourselves towards Him Who hath turned towards you. He,  verily, is the Face of God amongst you, and His Testimony and His Guide  unto you. He hath come to you with signs which none can produce.\" The  voice of the Burning Bush is raised in the midmost heart of the world, and  the Holy Spirit calleth aloud among the nations: \"Lo, the Desired One is  come with manifest dominion!\"    135 O King! The stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen, they who  seek to establish the truth of My Cause through the things they possess,  and who make mention of God in My Name. And yet, when I came unto them in  My glory, they turned aside. They, indeed, are of the fallen. This is,  truly, that which the Spirit of God hath announced, when He came with  truth unto you, He with Whom the Jewish doctors disputed, till at last  they perpetrated what hath made the Holy Spirit to lament, and the tears  of them that have near access to God to flow. Consider how a Pharisee who  had worshipped God for seventy years repudiated the Son when He appeared,  whereas one who had committed adultery gained admittance into the Kingdom.  Thus doth the Pen admonish thee as bidden by the Eternal King, that thou  mayest be apprised of what came to pass aforetime and be reckoned in this  day among them that truly believe.    136 Say: O concourse of monks! Seclude not yourselves in your churches and  cloisters. Come ye out of them by My leave, and busy, then, yourselves  with what will profit you and others. Thus commandeth you He Who is the  Lord of the Day of Reckoning. Seclude yourselves in the stronghold of My  love. This, truly, is the seclusion that befitteth you, could ye but know  it. He that secludeth himself in his house is indeed as one dead. It  behoveth man to show forth that which will benefit mankind. He that  bringeth forth no fruit is fit for the fire. Thus admonisheth you your  Lord; He, verily, is the Mighty, the Bountiful. Enter ye into wedlock,  that after you another may arise in your stead. We, verily, have forbidden  you lechery, and not that which is conducive to fidelity. Have ye clung  unto the promptings of your nature, and cast behind your backs the  statutes of God? Fear ye God, and be not of the foolish. But for man, who,  on My earth, would remember Me, and how could My attributes and My names  be revealed? Reflect, and be not of them that have shut themselves out as  by a veil from Him, and were of those that are fast asleep. He that  married not could find no place wherein to abide, nor where to lay His  head, by reason of what the hands of the treacherous had wrought. His  holiness consisted not in the things ye have believed and imagined, but  rather in the things which belong unto Us. Ask, that ye may be made aware  of His station which hath been exalted above the vain imaginings of all  the peoples of the earth. Blessed are they that understand.    137 O King! We heard the words thou didst utter in answer to the Czar of  Russia, concerning the decision made regarding the war.(15) Thy Lord,  verily, knoweth, is informed of all. Thou didst say: \"I lay asleep upon my  couch, when the cry of the oppressed, who were drowned in the Black Sea,  wakened me.\" This is what We heard thee say, and, verily, thy Lord is  witness unto what I say. We testify that that which wakened thee was not  their cry but the promptings of thine own passions, for We tested thee,  and found thee wanting. Comprehend the meaning of My words, and be thou of  the discerning. It is not Our wish to address thee words of condemnation,  out of regard for the dignity We conferred upon thee in this mortal life.  We, verily, have chosen courtesy, and made it the true mark of such as are  nigh unto Him. Courtesy is, in truth, a raiment which fitteth all men,  whether young or old. Well is it with him that adorneth his temple  therewith, and woe unto him who is deprived of this great bounty. Hadst  thou been sincere in thy words, thou wouldst have not cast behind thy back  the Book of God, when it was sent unto thee by Him Who is the Almighty,  the All-Wise. We have proved thee through it, and found thee other than  that which thou didst profess. Arise, and make amends for that which  escaped thee. Erelong the world and all that thou possessest will perish,  and the kingdom will remain unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy fathers  of old. It behoveth thee not to conduct thine affairs according to the  dictates of thy desires. Fear the sighs of this Wronged One, and shield  Him from the darts of such as act unjustly.    138 For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown into confusion,  and thine empire shall pass from thine hands, as a punishment for that  which thou hast wrought.(16) Then wilt thou know how thou hast plainly  erred. Commotions shall seize all the people in that land, unless thou  arisest to help this Cause, and followest Him Who is the Spirit of God in  this, the Straight Path. Hath thy pomp made thee proud? By My Life! It  shall not endure; nay, it shall soon pass away, unless thou holdest fast  to this firm Cord. We see abasement hastening after thee, whilst thou art  of the heedless. It behoveth thee when thou hearest His Voice calling from  the seat of glory to cast away all that thou possessest, and cry out:  \"Here am I, O Lord of all that is in heaven and all that is on earth!\"    139 O King! We were in 'Iraq, when the hour of parting arrived. At the  bidding of the King of Islam(17) We set Our steps in his direction. Upon  Our arrival, there befell Us at the hands of the malicious that which the  books of the world can never adequately recount. Thereupon the inmates of  Paradise, and they that dwell within the retreats of holiness, lamented;  and yet the people are wrapped in a thick veil! Say: Do ye cavil at Him  Who hath come unto you bearing the clear evidence of God and His proof,  the testimony of God and His signs? These things are not from Himself;  nay, rather they proceed from the One Who hath raised Him up, sent Him  forth through the power of truth, and made Him to be a lamp unto all  mankind.    140 More grievous became Our plight from day to day, nay, from hour to  hour, until they took Us forth from Our prison and made Us, with glaring  injustice, enter the Most Great Prison. And if anyone ask them: \"For what  crime were they imprisoned?\", they would answer and say: \"They, verily,  sought to supplant the Faith with a new religion!\" If that which is  ancient be what ye prefer, wherefore, then, have ye discarded that which  hath been set down in the Torah and the Evangel? Clear it up, O men! By My  life! There is no place for you to flee to in this day. If this be My  crime, then Muhammad, the Apostle of God, committed it before Me, and  before Him He Who was the Spirit of God, and yet earlier He Who conversed  with God. And if My sin be this, that I have exalted the Word of God and  revealed His Cause, then indeed am I the greatest of sinners! Such a sin I  will not barter for the kingdoms of earth and heaven.    141 Upon Our arrival at this Prison, We purposed to transmit to the kings  the messages of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Though We have  transmitted to them, in several Tablets, that which We were commanded, yet  We do it once again as a token of God's grace. Perchance they may  recognize the Lord, Who hath come down in the clouds with manifest  sovereignty.    142 As My tribulations multiplied, so did My love for God and for "]]]
