CHAPTER XIX.    FAR WEST.      We must now leave the pleasant scenes of preaching the gospel in England,  and go back to the more troubled times among the main body of the Saints in  the State of Missouri.    You will remember that when the Saints were driven from Jackson county,  they found a place to rest in Clay county just north across the river. The  people of Clay received them kindly, and the Saints stayed for about three  years in that county. During this period, they tried many times to regain  their homes by asking the governor and even the president of the United  States to enforce the laws and see that their lands and homes were given  back to them. Governor Dunklin talked very pleasantly about the rights of  the Saints, but in the end he did nothing to protect the people or help  them to gain possession of their property.    At a large meeting held in Liberty, the county seat of Clay county, on the  16th of June, 1834, in order to try to settle the trouble between the  Saints and the Jackson county people, the following offer was made by the  Jackson men to the Saints:    The Jackson people offered to buy all the land of the \"Mormons\" in Jackson  county, paying them a high price for it within thirty days, or the people  of Jackson offered to sell all their lands to the \"Mormons\" at the same  high price to be paid for in thirty days. This offer may seem to be fair,  but when it is remembered that the Lord had revealed to them that the city  of Zion should be built in Jackson county, and had told the Saints to buy  and not sell, it will be seen that this offer was not meant in good faith.  Again, the Saints could not buy out all the mobbers' land in Jackson, much  as they would have liked so to do, as there was so much of it, and they had  no money to pay for it in thirty days. The Saints therefore could not agree  to this, but they made an offer to buy out the lands of those who could not  live in peace with them, and pay them in one year.    Nothing came of these offers.    And now the people of Clay county asked the Saints to remove from their  midst. The country was again getting excited about the \"Mormons,\" and the  Clay county people were afraid that the mobs would come to disturb them; so  in order to be on good terms with the people who had been friends to them,  the Saints again left their homes and traveled north-east, away out into  the country where there were hardly any settlers. Here they began to build  a city which they called Far West, and after a time they had a county laid  off which was named Caldwell.    This movement began in September, 1836, and by the next summer nearly all  the Saints had left Clay county.    You will call to mind that the Prophet Joseph, with the brethren in Zion's  Camp had visited the Saints while in Clay county. In the spring of 1838  Joseph arrived at Far West from Kirtland, and from that time on the Prophet  remained with the main body of the Saints in Missouri and Illinois.    The Saints now had peace again for a season. They gathered to Far West and  surrounding places from Kirtland and other eastern localities. Farms were  made, houses built, towns laid out, and it seemed as if the Saints could at  last live and enjoy their rights as Americans.    Joseph was busy setting the Church in order and in receiving the word of  the Lord for the guidance of the Saints.    One of the most important revelations given at this time was regarding the  law of tithing. This law says that the Saints should first put all their  surplus property into the hands of the bishop to be used for the benefit of  the Church, and then after that, they should pay one tenth of all they  made, as a tithing to the Lord; and the Lord further said that if the  Saints did not keep this law, the land whereon they dwelt should not be a  land of Zion unto them.    In the year 1838 the Saints in and around Far West numbered about twelve  thousand. Thus you see they began to be a power in the land, especially  when it came to voting for officers of the state and county. At these times  the Saints would of course vote for good men, men who were their friends,  and this often made the Missourians angry.    At an election in Gallatin, the county seat of Daviess county, August 6,  1838, a mob of Missourians tried to prevent the brethren from voting. A  general fight was the result, in which the \"Mormons\" defended themselves  with umbrellas, sticks, whips, and their stout fists.    Reports came to Joseph and the people in Far West that some of the brethren  had been killed and that the mobbers would not let their bodies be buried.  At this, Joseph, with about twenty armed men, rode towards the scene of  trouble. On the way he learned that the report was not true. They then  called on a justice of the peace, named Adam Black. Mr. Black promised  Joseph that he would not aid the mob, but would enforce the laws justly.  Next day Joseph and his party held a meeting with some leading men of the  county, wherein both parties promised to keep the peace, and if any person  broke the law in this respect he was to be given up to the officers of the  law and punished.    Some twenty days after Mr. Black had made such good promises, he and some  others had papers made out for the arrest of Joseph Smith and Lyman Wight  for coming into Daviess co., and doing all kinds of wicked deeds. When the  constable called on Joseph at Far West, Joseph said he was willing to stand  trial, but he wanted it to be in Caldwell, instead of Daviess county, as in  the latter there existed too much excitement and ill-feeling. The officer  did not arrest the Prophet at this time, but the report spread that Joseph  had resisted the officer and would not be arrested. To prove how false this  was, Joseph with his brother Hyrum and some others, went to Daviess county  for trial. At this trial Mr. Black swore to some wicked falsehoods, and  although four witnesses told the truth of the matter, Joseph and Lyman were  bound over, that is, they were to be ready to stand trial when the regular  court should meet.    False reports now flew far and wide again, and the mobs began to gather  from other counties to \"help drive the Mormons from the State.\" Some of the  mob painted and dressed themselves up as Indians. The Saints, especially in  the smaller settlements, were attacked, until they had to flee to Far West  for protection. The Saints now thought it time to protect themselves from  the mobs, so they organized a company of state militia. Lyman Wight was an  officer in this militia and he commanded the men. He succeeded in driving  the mob from Daviess county, but this of course, only made the excitement  the greater.    On the evening of October 24, 1838, news reached Far West that a Methodist  preacher by the name of Bogart was leading a mob to destroy the property of  the Saints on Log Creek. That same evening a company of about seventy-five  men led by Captain David W. Patten mounted their horses and rode to the  scene of trouble. Early the next morning, just as it was getting daylight  the mob was found encamped on Crooked River. The Far West Militia  dismounted and marched on to the enemy. A battle took place. The mob took  refuge behind the river bank, while the brethren charged them sword in  hand. The enemy was soon put to flight across the river. As they were  fleeing, one of the mobbers wheeled around from behind a tree and shot  Captain Patten, who instantly fell. A number of brethren were badly  wounded, and two died the next night. One was Patterson O'Banion, and the  other Captain Patten.    Brother Patten was a member of the first quorum of Twelve Apostles. He had  taken an active part in the affairs of the Church up to the time of his  death, having filled many missions and done many great works in the name of  Jesus Christ. Apostle Patten was one of the first martyrs of the Church. Of  him Joseph the Prophet said at his funeral:    \"There lies a man who has done just as he said he would; he has laid down  his life for his friends.\"    Topics.--1. The Saints in Clay county. 2.

It occurred on October 30, 1838, during the time of great excitement, when  bands of armed men roamed over the country doing what damage they could to  the homes of the Saints.    At a point on Shoal Creek, about sixteen miles from Fat West, a brother by  the name of Haun had built a flour mill. Besides the mill there were a  blacksmith shop and half a dozen houses. About thirty families lived here,  some of which had just arrived from the Eastern States and were yet camping  in their tents."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16545"],[0,"King Alfred of England (#12)"],[1,"Church of Rome,  making regular contributions in money to sustain the papal authority,  and looking to Rome as the great and central point of Christian  influence and power, and the object of supreme veneration. We have  already seen that the Saxons had established a seminary at Rome, which  King Ethelwolf, Alfred's father, rebuilt and re-endowed. One of the  former Anglo-Saxon kings, too, had given a grant of one penny from  every house in the kingdom to the successors of St. Peter at Rome,  which tax, though nominally small, produced a very considerable sum  in the aggregate, exceeding for many years the royal revenues of the  kings of England. It continued to be paid down to the time of Henry  VIII., when the reformation swept away that, and all the other  national obligations of England to the Catholic Church together.    In the age of Alfred, however, there were not only these public acts  of acknowledgment recognizing the papal supremacy, but there was  a strong tide of personal and private feeling of veneration and  attachment to the mother Church, of which it is hard for us, in the  present divided state of Christendom, to conceive. The religious  thoughts and affections of every pious heart throughout the realm  centered in Rome. Rome, too, was the scene of many miracles, by which  the imaginations of the superstitious and of the truly devout were  excited, which impressed them with an idea of power in which they felt  a sort of confiding sense of protection. This power was continually  interposing, now in one way and now in another, to protect virtue, to  punish crime, and to testify to the impious and to the devout, to each  in an appropriate way, that their respective deeds were the objects,  according to their character, of the displeasure or of the approbation  of Heaven.    On one occasion, the following incident is said to have occurred. The  narration of it will illustrate the ideas of the time. A child of  about seven years old, named Kenelm, succeeded to the throne in the  Anglo-Saxon line. Being too young to act for himself, he was put under  the charge of a sister, who was to act as regent until the boy became  of age. The sister, ambitious of making the power thus delegated  to her entirely her own, decided on destroying her brother. She  commissioned a hired murderer to perpetrate the deed. The murderer  took the child into a wood, killed him, and hid his body in a thicket,  in a certain cow-pasture at a place called Clent. The sister then  assumed the scepter in her own name, and suppressed all inquiries in  respect to the fate of her brother; and his murder might have remained  forever undiscovered, had it not been miraculously revealed at Rome.    A white dove flew into a church there one day, and let fall upon the  altar of St. Peter a paper, on which was written, in Anglo-Saxon  characters,          In Clent Cow-batch, Kenelme king bearne, lieth under Thorne, head      bereaved.      For a time nobody could read the writing. At length an Anglo-Saxon  saw it, and translated it into Latin, so that the pope and all others  could understand it. The pope then sent a letter to the authorities in  England, who made search and found the body.    But we must end these digressions, which we have indulged thus far in  order to give the reader some distinct conception of the ideas and  habits of the times, and proceed, in the next chapter, to relate the  events immediately connected with Alfred's accession to the throne.    [Footnote 1: A great many other tales are told of the miraculous  phenomena exhibited by the body of St. Edmund, which well illustrate  the superstitious credulity of those times. One writer says seriously  that, when the head was found, a wolf had it, holding it carefully in  his paws, with all the gentleness and care that the most faithful dog  would manifest in guarding a trust committed to him by his master.  This wolf followed the funeral procession to the tomb where the body  was deposited, and then disappeared. The head joined itself to the  body again where it had been severed, leaving only a purple line to  mark the place of separation.]          CHAPTER VI.    ALFRED'S ACCESSION TO THE THRONE      At the battle in which Alfred's brother, Ethelred, whom Alfred  succeeded on the throne, was killed, as is briefly mentioned at the  close of chapter fourth, Alfred himself, then a brave and energetic  young man, fought by his side. The party of Danes whom they were  contending against in this fatal fight was the same one that came  out in the expedition organized by the sons of Lothbroc, and whose  exploits in destroying monasteries and convents were described in the  last chapter. Soon after the events there narrated, this formidable  body of marauders moved westward, toward that part of the kingdom  where the dominions more particularly pertaining to the family of  Alfred lay.    There was in those days a certain stronghold or castle on the River  Thames, about forty miles west from London, which was not far from  the confines of Ethelred's dominions. The large and populous town of  Reading now stands upon the spot. It is at the confluence of the River  Thames with the Kennet, a small branch of the Thames, which here flows  into it from the south. The spot, having the waters of the rivers for  a defense upon two sides of it, was easily fortified. A castle had  been built there, and, as usual in such cases, a town had sprung up  about the walls.    The Danes advanced to this stronghold and took possession of it, and  they made it for some time their head-quarters. It was at once the  center from which they carried on their enterprises in all directions  about the island, and the refuge to which they could always retreat  when defeated and pursued. In the possession of such a fastness, they,  of course, became more formidable than ever. King Ethelred determined  to dislodge them. He raised, accordingly, as large a force as his  kingdom would furnish, and, taking his brother Alfred as his second in  command, he advanced toward Reading in a very resolute and determined  manner.    He first encountered a large body of the Danes who were out on a  marauding excursion. This party consisted only of a small detachment,  the main body of the army of the Danes having been left at Reading to  strengthen and complete the fortifications. They were digging a trench  from river to river, so as completely to insulate the castle, and make  it entirely inaccessible on either side except by boats or a bridge.  With the earth thrown out of the trench they were making an embankment  on the inner side, so that an enemy, after crossing the ditch, would  have a steep ascent to climb, defended too, as of course it would be  in such an emergency, by long lines of desperate men upon the top,  hurling at the assailants showers of javelins and arrows.    While, therefore, a considerable portion of the Danes were at work  within and around their castle, to make it as nearly as possible  impregnable as a place of defense, the detachment above referred to  had gone forth for plunder, under the command of some of the bolder  and more adventurous spirits in the horde. This party Ethelred  overtook. A furious battle was fought. The Danes were defeated, and  driven off the ground. They fled toward Reading. Ethelred and Alfred  pursued them. The various parties of Danes that were outside of the  fortifications, employed in completing the outworks, or encamped in  the neighborhood, were surprised and slaughtered; or, at least,  vast numbers of them were killed, and the rest retreated within the  works--all maddened at their defeat, and burning with desire for  revenge.    The Saxons were not strong enough to dispossess them of their  fastness. On the contrary, in a few days, the Danes, having matured  their plans, made a desperate sally against the Saxons, and, after a  very determined and obstinate conflict, they gained the victory, and  drove the Saxons off the ground. Some of the leading Saxon chieftains  were killed, and the whole country was thrown into great alarm at  the danger which was impending, that the Danes would soon gain the  complete and undisputed possession of the whole land.    The Saxons, however, were not yet prepared to give up the struggle.  They rallied their forces, gathered new recruits, reorganized their  ranks, and made preparations for another struggle. The Danes, too,  feeling fresh strength and energy in consequence of their successes,  formed themselves in battle array, and, leaving their strong-hold,  they marched out into the open country in pursuit of their foe. The  two armies gradually approached each other and prepared for battle.  Every thing portended a terrible conflict, which was to be, in fact,  the great final struggle.    The place where the armies met was called in those times AEscesdune,  which means Ashdown. It was, in fact, a hill-side covered with ash  trees. The name has become shortened and softened in the course of the  ten centuries which have intervened since this celebrated battle, into  Aston; if, indeed, as is generally supposed, the Aston of the present  day is the locality of the ancient battle.    The armies came into the vicinity of each other toward the close of  the day. They were both eager for the contest, or, at least, they  pretended to be so, but they waited until the morning. The Danes  divided their forces into two bodies. Two kings commanded one  division, and certain chieftains, called _earls_, directed the  other. King Ethelred undertook to meet this order of battle by  a corresponding distribution of his own troops, and he gave,  accordingly, to Alfred the command of one division, while he himself  was to lead the other. All things being thus arranged, the hum and  bustle of the two great encampments subsided at last, at a late hour,  as the men sought repose under their rude tents, in preparation for  the fatigues and"]]]
