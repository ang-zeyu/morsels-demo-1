The most skillful gauger I ever knew was a maligned cobbler, armed  with a poniard, who drove a peddler's wagon, using a mullein stalk as  an instrument of coercion to tyrannize over his pony shod with  calks. He was a Galilean Sadducee, and he had a phthisicky catarrh,  diphtheria, and the bilious intermittent erysipelas.    2. A certain sibyl, with the sobriquet of \"Gypsy,\" went into ecstasies  of cachinnation at seeing him measure a bushel of peas and separate  saccharine tomatoes from a heap of peeled potatoes, without dyeing or  singeing the ignitible queue which he wore, or becoming paralyzed with  hemorrhage.    3. Lifting her eyes to the ceiling of the cupola of the capitol to  conceal her unparalleled embarrassment, making him a rough courtesy,  and not harrassing him with mystifying, rarefying, and stupefying  innuendoes, she gave him a couch, a bouquet of lilies, mignonette,  and fuchsias, a treatise on mnemonics, a copy of the Apocrypha  in hieroglyphics, daguerreotypes of Mendelssohn and Kosciusko, a  kaleidoscope, a dram-phial of ipecacuanha, a teaspoonful of naphtha  for deleble purposes, a ferrule, a clarionet, some licorice, a  surcingle, a carnelian of symmetrical proportions, a chronometer with  a movable balance-wheel, a box of dominoes, and a catechism.    4. The gauger, who was also a trafficking rectifier and a parishioner  of mine, preferring a woolen surtout (his choice was referrible to  a vacillating, occasionally occurring idiosyncrasy), wofully uttered  this apothegm: \"Life is checkered; but schism, apostasy, heresy and  villainy shall be punished.\" The sibyl apologizingly answered: \"There  is a ratable and allegeable difference between a conferrable ellipsis  and a trisyllabic diaeresis.\" We replied in trochees, not impugning her  suspicion.      SELECT READING.    1. One enervating morning, just after the rise of the sun, a youth  bearing the cognomen of Galileo glided into his gondola over the  legendary waters of the lethean Thames. He was accompanied by  his allies and coadjutors, the dolorous Pepys and the erudite  Cholmondeley, the most combative aristocrat extant, and an epicurean  who, for learned vagaries and revolting discrepancies of character,  would take precedence of the most erudite of all Areopagite literati.    2. These sacrilegious _dramatis personae_ were discussing in detail a  suggestive and exhaustive address, delivered from the proscenium  box of the Calisthenic Lyceum by a notable financier on obligatory  hydropathy, as accessory to the irrevocable and irreparable doctrine  of evolution, which had been vehemently panegyrized by a splenetic  professor of acoustics, and simultaneously denounced by a complaisant  opponent as an undemonstrated romance of the last decade, amenable  to no reasoning, however allopathic, outside of its own lamentable  environs.    3. These peremptory tripartite brethren arrived at Greenwich, wishing  to aggrandize themselves by indulging in exemplary relaxation,  indicatory of implacable detestation of integral tergiversation and  exoteric intrigue. They fraternized with a phrenological harlequin who  was a connoisseur in mezzotint and falconry. The piquant person was  heaping contumely and scathing raillery on an amateur in jugular  recitative, who held that the Pharaohs of Asia were conversant with  his theory that morphine and quinine were exorcists of bronchitis.    4. Meanwhile, the leisurely Augustine of Cockburn drank from a  tortoise-shell wassail cup to the health of an apotheosized recusant,  who was his supererogatory patron, and an assistant recognizance  in the immobile nomenclature of interstitial molecular phonics. The  contents of the vase proving soporific, a stolid plebeian took from  its cerements a heraldic violoncello, and, assisted by a plethoric  diocesan from Pall Mall, who performed on a sonorous piano-forte,  proceeded to wake the clangorous echoes of the Empyrean. They bade  the prolyx Caucasian gentlemen not to misconstrue their inexorable  demands, while they dined on acclimated anchovies and apricot  truffles, and had for dessert a wiseacre's pharmacopoeia. Thus the  truculent Pythagoreans had a novel repast fit for the gods.    5. On the subsidence of the feast they alternated between soft  languors and isolated scenes of squalor, which followed a mechanist's  reconnaissance of the imagery of Uranus, the legend of whose incognito  related to a poniard wound in the abdomen received while cutting  a swath in the interests of telegraphy and posthumous photography.  Meantime an unctuous orthoepist applied a homeopathic restorative  to the retina of an objurgatory spaniel (named Daniel) and tried to  perfect the construction of a behemoth which had got mired in pygmean  slough, while listening to the elegiac soughing of the prehistoric  wind.      SELECT READING.    1. Geoffrey, surnamed Winthrop, sat in the depot at Chicago, waiting  for his train and reading the Tribune, when a squadron of street Arabs  (incomparable for squalor) thronged from a neighboring alley,  uttering hideous cries, accompanied by inimitable gestures of heinous  exultation, as they tortured a humble black-and-tan dog.    2. \"You little blackguards!\" cried Winthrop, stepping outside and  confronting them, adding the inquiry, \"Whose dog is that?\"    3. \"That audacious Caucasian has the bravado to interfere with  our clique,\" tauntingly shrieked the indisputable little ruffian,  exhibiting combativeness.    4. \"What will you take for him?\" asked the lenient Geoffrey, ignoring  the venial tirade.    5. \"Twenty-seven cents,\" piquantly answered the ribald urchin,  grabbing the crouching dog by the nape.    6. \"You can buy licorice and share with the indecorous coadjutors of  your condemnable cruelty,\" said Winthrop, paying the price and taking  the dog from the child. Then catching up his valise and umbrella  he hastened to his train. Winthrop satisfied himself that his sleek  protege was not wounded, and then cleaned the cement from the pretty  collar, and read these words; \"Leicester. Licensed, No. 1880.\"    7. Hearing the pronunciation of his name, the docile canine expressed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1441"],[0,"The Story of an African Farm (#12)"],[1,"a living creature without a word of greeting. Coming nearer, he  found it was no other than the wife of the absconding Kaffer herd. She  had a baby tied on her back by a dirty strip of red blanket; another  strip hardly larger was twisted round her waist, for the rest her black  body was naked. She was a sullen, ill-looking woman with lips hideously  protruding.    The German questioned her as to how she came there. She muttered in  broken Dutch that she had been turned away. Had she done evil? She shook  her head sullenly. Had she had food given her? She grunted a negative,  and fanned the flies from her baby. Telling the woman to remain where  she was, he turned his horse's head to the road and rode off at a  furious pace.    \"Hard-hearted! cruel! Oh, my God! Is this the way? Is this charity?\"    \"Yes, yes, yes,\" ejaculated the old man as he rode on; but, presently,  his anger began to evaporate, his horse's pace slackened, and by the  time he had reached his own door he was nodding and smiling.    Dismounting quickly, he went to the great chest where his provisions  were kept. Here he got out a little meal, a little mealies, a few  roaster-cakes. These he tied up in three blue handkerchiefs, and putting  them into a sailcloth bag, he strung them over his shoulders. Then he  looked circumspectly out at the door. It was very bad to be discovered  in the act of giving; it made him red up to the roots of his old  grizzled hair. No one was about, however, so he rode off again. Beside  the milk-bush sat the Kaffer woman still--like Hagar, he thought, thrust  out by her mistress in the wilderness to die. Telling her to loosen the  handkerchief from her head, he poured into it the contents of his bag.  The woman tied it up in sullen silence.    \"You must try and get to the next farm,\" said the German.    The woman shook her head; she would sleep in the field.    The German reflected. Kaffer women were accustomed to sleep in the open  air; but then, the child was small, and after so hot a day the night  might be chilly. That she would creep back to the huts at the homestead  when the darkness favoured her, the German's sagacity did not make  evident to him. He took off the old brown salt-and-pepper coat, and held  it out to her. The woman received it in silence, and laid it across her  knee. \"With that they will sleep warmly; not so bad. Ha, ha!\" said the  German. And he rode home, nodding his head in a manner that would have  made any other man dizzy.    \"I wish he would not come back tonight,\" said Em, her face wet with  tears.    \"It will be just the same if he comes back tomorrow,\" said Lyndall.    The two girls sat on the step of the cabin weeping for the German's  return. Lyndall shaded her eyes with her hand from the sunset light.    \"There he comes,\" she said, \"whistling 'Ach Jerusalem du schone' so loud  I can hear him from here.\"    \"Perhaps he has found the sheep.\"    \"Found them!\" said Lyndall. \"He would whistle just so if he knew he had  to die tonight.\"    \"You look at the sunset, eh, chickens?\" the German said, as he came  up at a smart canter. \"Ah, yes, that is beautiful!\" he added, as he  dismounted, pausing for a moment with his hand on the saddle to look  at the evening sky, where the sun shot up long flaming streaks, between  which and the eye thin yellow clouds floated. \"Ei! you weep?\" said the  German, as the girls ran up to him.    Before they had time to reply the voice of Tant Sannie was heard.    \"You child, of the child, of the child of a Kaffer's dog, come here!\"    The German looked up. He thought the Dutchwoman, come out to cool  herself in the yard, called to some misbehaving servant. The old man  looked round to see who it might be.    \"You old vagabond of a praying German, are you deaf?\"    Tant Sannie stood before the steps of the kitchen; upon them sat the  lean Hottentot, upon the highest stood Bonaparte Blenkins, both hands  folded under the tails of his coat, and his eyes fixed on the sunset  sky.    The German dropped the saddle on the ground.    \"Bish, bish, bish! what may this be?\" he said, and walked toward the  house. \"Very strange!\"    The girls followed him: Em still weeping; Lyndall with her face rather  white and her eyes wide open.    \"And I have the heart of a devil, did you say? You could run me through  with a knife, could you?\" cried the Dutchwoman. \"I could not drive the  Kaffer maid away because I was afraid of you, was I? Oh, you miserable  rag! I loved you, did I? I would have liked to marry you, would I? would  I? WOULD I?\" cried the Boer-woman; \"you cat's tail, you dog's paw! Be  near my house tomorrow morning when the sun rises,\" she gasped, \"my  Kaffers will drag you through the sand. They would do it gladly, any of  them, for a bit of tobacco, for all your prayings with them.\"    \"I am bewildered, I am bewildered,\" said the German, standing before her  and raising his hand to his forehead; \"I--I do not understand.\"    \"Ask him, ask him?\" cried Tant Sannie, pointing to Bonaparte; \"he knows.  You thought he could not make me understand, but he did, he did, you  old fool! I know enough English for that. You be here,\" shouted the  Dutchwoman, \"when the morning star rises, and I will let my Kaffers take  you out and drag you, till there is not one bone left in your old body  that is not broken as fine as bobootie-meat, you old beggar! All your  rags are not worth that--they should be thrown out onto the ash-heap,\"  cried the Boer-woman; \"but I will have them for my sheep. Not one rotten  hoof of your old mare do you take with you; I will have her--all, all  for my sheep that you have lost, you godless thing!\"    The Boer-woman wiped the moisture from her mouth with the palm of her  hand.    The German turned to Bonaparte, who still stood on the step absorbed in  the beauty of the sunset.    \"Do not address me; do not approach me, lost man,\" said Bonaparte, not  moving his eye nor lowering his chin. \"There is a crime from which all  nature revolts; there is a crime whose name is loathsome to the human  ear--that crime is yours; that crime is ingratitude. This woman has been  your benefactress; on her farm you have lived; after her sheep you have  looked; into her house you have been allowed to enter and hold Divine  service--an honour of which you were never worthy; and how have you  rewarded her?--basely, basely, basely!\"    \"But it is all false, lies and falsehoods. I must, I will speak,\" said  the German, suddenly looking round bewildered. \"Do I dream? Are you mad?  What may it be?\"    \"Go, dog,\" cried the Dutchwoman; \"I would have been a rich woman this  day if it had not been for your laziness. Praying with the Kaffers  behind the kraal walls. Go, you Kaffer's dog!\"    \"But what then is the matter? What may have happened since I left?\" said  the German, turning to the Hottentot woman, who sat upon the step.    She was his friend; she would tell him kindly the truth. The woman  answered by a loud, ringing laugh.    \"Give it him, old missis! Give it him!\"    It was so nice to see the white man who had been master hunted down. The  coloured woman laughed, and threw a dozen mealie grains into her mouth  to chew.    All anger and excitement faded from the old man's face. He turned slowly  away and walked down the little path to his cabin, with his shoulders  bent; it was all dark before him. He stumbled over the threshold of his  own well-known door.    Em, sobbing bitterly, would have followed him; but the Boer-woman  prevented her by a flood of speech which convulsed the Hottentot, so low  were its images.    \"Come, Em,\" said Lyndall, lifting her small proud head, \"let us go in.  We will not stay to hear such language.\"    She looked into the Boer-woman's eyes. Tant Sannie understood the  meaning of the look if not the words. She waddled after them, and caught  Em by the arm. She had struck Lyndall once years before, and had never  done it again, so she took Em.    \"So you will defy me, too, will you, you Englishman's ugliness!\" she  cried, and with one hand she forced the child down, and held her head  tightly against her knee; with the other she beat her first upon one  cheek, and then upon the other.    For one instant Lyndall looked on, then she laid her small fingers on  the Boer-woman's arm. With the exertion of half its strength Tant Sannie  might have flung the girl back upon the stones. It was not the power  of the slight fingers, tightly though they clinched her broad wrist--so  tightly that at bedtime the marks were still there; but the Boer-woman  looked into the clear eyes and at the quivering white lips, and with a  half-surprised curse relaxed her hold. The girl drew Em's arm through  her own.    \"Move!\" she said to Bonaparte, who stood in the door, and he, Bonaparte  the invincible, in the hour of his triumph, moved to give her place.    The Hottentot ceased to laugh, and an uncomfortable silence fell on all  the three in the doorway.    Once in their room, Em sat down on the floor and wailed bitterly.  Lyndall lay on the bed with her arm drawn across her eyes, very white  and still.    \"Hoo, hoo!\" cried Em; \"and they won't let him take the grey mare; and  Waldo has gone to the mill. Hoo, hoo, and perhaps they won't let us go  and say good-bye to him. Hoo, hoo, hoo!\"    \"I wish you would be quiet,\" said Lyndall without moving. \"Does it give  you such felicity to let Bonaparte know he is hurting you? We will ask  no one. It will be suppertime soon. Listen--and when you hear the clink  of the knives and forks we will go out and see him.\"    Em suppressed her sobs and listened intently, kneeling at the door.  Suddenly some one came to the window and put the shutter up.    \"Who was that?\" said Lyndall, starting.    \"The girl, I suppose,\" said Em. \"How early she is this evening!\"    But Lyndall sprang from the bed and seized the handle of the door,  shaking it fiercely. The door was locked on the outside. She ground her  teeth.    \"What is"]]]
