He standeth exalted beyond and above all separation  and union, all proximity and remoteness. No sign can indicate His presence  or His absence; inasmuch as by a word of His command all that are in  heaven and on earth have come to exist, and by His wish, which is the  Primal Will itself, all have stepped out of utter nothingness into the  realm of being, the world of the visible.    Gracious God! How could there be conceived any existing relationship or  possible connection between His Word and they that are created of it? The  verse: \"God would have you beware of Himself\"(72) unmistakably beareth  witness to the reality of Our argument, and the words: \"God was alone;  there was none else besides Him\" are a sure testimony of its truth. All  the Prophets of God and their chosen Ones, all the divines, the sages, and  the wise of every generation, unanimously recognize their inability to  attain unto the comprehension of that Quintessence of all truth, and  confess their incapacity to grasp Him, Who is the inmost Reality of all  things.    The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days being thus closed in the  face of all beings, the Source of infinite grace, according to His saying:  \"His grace hath transcended all things; My grace hath encompassed them  all\" hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of the  realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the human temple, and be made  manifest unto all men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries  of the unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of His imperishable  Essence. These sanctified Mirrors, these Day-springs of ancient glory are  one and all the Exponents on earth of Him Who is the central Orb of the  universe, its Essence and ultimate Purpose. From Him proceed their  knowledge and power; from Him is derived their sovereignty. The beauty of  their countenance is but a reflection of His image, and their revelation a  sign of His deathless glory. They are the Treasuries of divine knowledge,  and the Repositories of celestial wisdom. Through them is transmitted a  grace that is infinite, and by them is revealed the light that can never  fade. Even as He hath said: \"There is no distinction whatsoever between  Thee and them; except that they are Thy servants, and are created of  Thee.\" This is the significance of the tradition: \"I am He, Himself, and  He is I, myself.\"    The traditions and sayings that bear direct reference to Our theme are  divers and manifold; We have refrained from quoting them for the sake of  brevity. Nay, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is a  direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attributes and names of  God, inasmuch as within every atom are enshrined the signs that bear  eloquent testimony to the revelation of that most great Light. Methinks,  but for the potency of that revelation, no being could ever exist. How  resplendent the luminaries of knowledge that shine in an atom, and how  vast the oceans of wisdom that surge within a drop! To a supreme degree is  this true of man, who, among all created things, hath been invested with  the robe of such gifts, and hath been singled out for the glory of such  distinction. For in him are potentially revealed all the attributes and  names of God to a degree that no other created being hath excelled or  surpassed. All these names and attributes are applicable to him. Even as  He hath said: \"Man is My mystery, and I am his mystery.\" Manifold are the  verses that have been repeatedly revealed in all the heavenly Books and  the holy Scriptures, expressive of this most subtle and lofty theme. Even  as He hath revealed: \"We will surely show them Our signs in the world and  within themselves.\"(73) Again He saith: \"And also in your own selves: will  ye not then behold the signs of God?\"(74) And yet again He revealeth: \"And  be ye not like those who forget God, and whom He hath therefore caused to  forget their own selves.\"(75) In this connection, He Who is the eternal  King--may the souls of all that dwell within the mystic Tabernacle be a  sacrifice unto Him--hath spoken: \"He hath known God who hath known  himself.\"    I swear by God, O esteemed and honoured friend! Shouldst thou ponder these  words in thine heart, thou wilt of a certainty find the doors of divine  wisdom and infinite knowledge flung open before thy face.    From that which hath been said it becometh evident that all things, in  their inmost reality, testify to the revelation of the names and  attributes of God within them. Each according to its capacity, indicateth,  and is expressive of, the knowledge of God. So potent and universal is  this revelation, that it hath encompassed all things, visible and  invisible. Thus hath He revealed: \"Hath aught else save Thee a power of  revelation which is not possessed by Thee, that it could have manifested  Thee? Blind is the eye which doth not perceive Thee.\" Likewise, hath the  eternal King spoken: \"No thing have I perceived, except that I perceived  God within it, God before it, or God after it.\" Also in the tradition of  Kumayl it is written: \"Behold, a light hath shone forth out of the Morn of  eternity, and lo! its waves have penetrated the inmost reality of all  men.\" Man, the noblest and most perfect of all created things, excelleth  them all in the intensity of this revelation, and is a fuller expression  of its glory. And of all men, the most accomplished, the most  distinguished and the most excellent are the Manifestations of the Sun of  Truth. Nay, all else besides these Manifestations, live by the operation  of their Will, and move and have their being through the outpourings of  their grace. \"But for Thee, I would have not created the heavens.\" Nay,  all in their holy presence fade into utter nothingness, and are a thing  forgotten. Human tongue can never befittingly sing their praise, and human  speech can never unfold their mystery. These Tabernacles of holiness,  these primal Mirrors which reflect the light of unfading glory, are but  expressions of Him Who is the Invisible of the Invisibles. By the  revelation of these gems of divine virtue all the names and attributes of  God, such as knowledge and power, sovereignty and dominion, mercy and  wisdom, glory, bounty and grace, are made manifest.    These attributes of God are not and have never been vouchsafed specially  unto certain Prophets, and withheld from others. Nay, all the Prophets of  God, His well-favoured, His holy, and chosen Messengers, are, without  exception, the bearers of His names, and the embodiments of His  attributes. They only differ in the intensity of their revelation, and the  comparative potency of their light. Even as He hath revealed: \"Some of the  Apostles We have caused to excel the others.\"(76) It hath therefore become  manifest and evident that within the tabernacles of these Prophets and  chosen Ones of God the light of His infinite names and exalted attributes  hath been reflected, even though the light of some of these attributes may  or may not be outwardly revealed from these luminous Temples to the eyes  of men. That a certain attribute of God hath not been outwardly manifested  by these Essences of Detachment doth in no wise imply that they Who are  the Daysprings of God's attributes and the Treasuries of His holy names  did not actually possess it. Therefore, these illuminated Souls, these  beauteous Countenances have, each and every one of them, been endowed with  all the attributes of God, such as sovereignty, dominion, and the like,  even though to outward seeming they be shorn of all earthly majesty. To  every discerning eye this is evident and manifest; it requireth neither  proof nor evidence.    Yea, inasmuch as the peoples of the world have failed to seek from the  luminous and crystal Springs of divine knowledge the inner meaning of  God's holy words, they therefore have languished, stricken and sore  athirst, in the vale of idle fancy and waywardness. They have strayed far  from the fresh and thirst-subduing waters, and gathered round the salt  that burneth bitterly. Concerning them, the Dove of Eternity hath spoken:  \"And if they see the path of righteousness, they will not take it for  their path; but if they see the path of error, for their path will they  take it. This, because they treated Our signs as lies, and were heedless  of them.\"(77)    To this testifieth that which hath been witnessed in this wondrous and  exalted Dispensation. Myriads of holy verses have descended from the  heaven of might and grace, yet no one hath turned thereunto, nor ceased to  cling to those words of men, not one letter of which they that have spoken  them comprehend. For this reason the people have doubted incontestable  truths, such as these, and caused themselves to be deprived of the Ridvan  of divine knowledge, and the eternal meads of celestial wisdom.    And now, to resume Our argument concerning the question: Why is it that  the sovereignty of the Qa'im, affirmed in the text of recorded traditions,  and handed down by the shining stars of the Muhammadan Dispensation, hath  not in the least been made manifest? Nay, the contrary hath come to pass.  Have not His disciples and companions been afflicted of men? Are they not  still the victims of the fierce opposition of their enemies? Are they not  today leading the life of abased and impotent mortals? Yea, the  sovereignty attributed to the Qa'im and spoken of in the scriptures, is a  reality, the truth of which none can doubt. This sovereignty, however, is  not the sovereignty which the minds of men have falsely imagined.  Moreover, the Prophets of old, each and every one, whenever announcing to  the people of their day the advent of the coming Revelation, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#12)"],[1," Thou, truly, art the Help in peril, the Self-Subsisting.            LV: \"O GOD! THE TRIALS THOU SENDEST ARE A SALVE TO THE...\"      O God! The trials Thou sendest are a salve to the sores of all them who  are devoted to Thy will; the remembrance of Thee is a healing medicine to  the hearts of such as have drawn nigh unto Thy court; nearness to Thee is  the true life of them who are Thy lovers; Thy presence is the ardent  desire of such as yearn to behold Thy face; remoteness from Thee is a  torment to those that have acknowledged Thy oneness, and separation from  Thee is death unto them that have recognized Thy truth!    I beseech Thee by the sighs which they whose souls pant after Thee have  uttered in their remoteness from Thy court, and by the cries of such of  Thy lovers as bemoan their separation from Thee, to nourish me with the  wine of Thy knowledge and the living waters of Thy love and pleasure.  Behold Thy handmaiden, O my Lord, who hath forgotten all else except Thee,  and who hath delighted herself with Thy love, and lamented over the things  that have befallen Thee at the hands of the wicked doers among Thy  creatures. Do Thou ordain for her that which Thou didst ordain for such of  Thy handmaidens as circle round the throne of Thy majesty, and gaze, at  eventide and at dawn, on Thy beauty.    Thou art, verily, the Lord of the Judgment Day.            LVI: \"GLORY BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! THESE ARE THE...\"      Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! These are the days whereon Thou hast  bidden all men to observe the fast, that through it they may purify their  souls and rid themselves of all attachment to any one but Thee, and that  out of their hearts may ascend that which will be worthy of the court of  Thy majesty and may well beseem the seat of the revelation of Thy oneness.  Grant, O my Lord, that this fast may become a river of life-giving waters  and may yield the virtue wherewith Thou hast endowed it. Cleanse Thou by  its means the hearts of Thy servants whom the evils of the world have  failed to hinder from turning towards Thine all-glorious Name, and who  have remained unmoved by the noise and tumult of such as have repudiated  Thy most resplendent signs which have accompanied the advent of Thy  Manifestation Whom Thou hast invested with Thy sovereignty, Thy power, Thy  majesty and glory. These are the servants who, as soon as Thy call reached  them, hastened in the direction of Thy mercy and were not kept back from  Thee by the changes and chances of this world or by any human limitations.    I am he, O my God, who testifieth to Thy unity, who acknowledgeth Thy  oneness, who boweth humbly before the revelations of Thy majesty, and who  recognizeth with downcast countenance the splendors of the light of Thy  transcendent glory. I have believed in Thee after Thou didst enable me to  know Thy Self, Whom Thou hast revealed to men's eyes through the power of  Thy sovereignty and might. Unto Him I have turned, wholly detached from  all things, and cleaving steadfastly unto the cord of Thy gifts and  favors. I have embraced His truth, and the truth of all the wondrous laws  and precepts that have been sent down unto Him. I have fasted for love of  Thee and in pursuance of Thine injunction, and have broken my fast with  Thy praise on my tongue and in conformity with Thy pleasure. Suffer me  not, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have fasted in the daytime,  who in the night-season have prostrated themselves before Thy face, and  who have repudiated Thy truth, disbelieved in Thy signs, gainsaid Thy  testimony, and perverted Thine utterances.    Open Thou, O my Lord, mine eyes and the eyes of all them that have sought  Thee, that we may recognize Thee with Thine own eyes. This is Thy bidding  given us in the Book sent down by Thee unto Him Whom Thou hast chosen by  Thy behest, Whom Thou hast singled out for Thy favor above all Thy  creatures, Whom Thou hast been pleased to invest with Thy sovereignty, and  Whom Thou hast specially favored and entrusted with Thy Message unto Thy  people. Praised be Thou, therefore, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast  graciously enabled us to recognize Him and to acknowledge whatsoever hath  been sent down unto Him, and conferred upon us the honor of attaining the  presence of the One Whom Thou didst promise in Thy Book and in Thy  Tablets.    Thou seest me then, O my God, with my face turned towards Thee, cleaving  steadfastly to the cord of Thy gracious providence and generosity, and  clinging to the hem of Thy tender mercies and bountiful favors. Destroy  not, I implore Thee, my hopes of attaining unto that which Thou didst  ordain for Thy servants who have turned towards the precincts of Thy court  and the sanctuary of Thy presence, and have observed the fast for love of  Thee. I confess, O my God, that whatever proceedeth from me is wholly  unworthy of Thy sovereignty and falleth short of Thy majesty. And yet I  beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast revealed Thy Self, in the  glory of Thy most excellent titles, unto all created things, in this  Revelation whereby Thou hast, through Thy most resplendent Name,  manifested Thy beauty, to give me to drink of the wine of Thy mercy and of  the pure beverage of Thy favor, which have streamed forth from the right  hand of Thy will, that I may so fix my gaze upon Thee and be so detached  from all else but Thee, that the world and all that hath been created  therein may appear before me as a fleeting day which Thou hast not deigned  to create.    I moreover entreat Thee, O my God, to rain down, from the heaven of Thy  will and the clouds of Thy mercy, that which will cleanse us from the  noisome savors of our transgressions, O Thou Who hast called Thyself the  God of Mercy! Thou art, verily, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the  Beneficent.    Cast not away, O my Lord, him that hath turned towards Thee, nor suffer  him who hath drawn nigh unto Thee to be removed far from Thy court. Dash  not the hopes of the suppliant who hath longingly stretched out his hands  to seek Thy grace and favors, and deprive not Thy sincere servants of the  wonders of Thy tender mercies and loving-kindness. Forgiving and Most  Bountiful art Thou, O my Lord! Power hast Thou to do what Thou pleasest.  All else but Thee are impotent before the revelations of Thy might, are as  lost in the face of the evidences of Thy wealth, are as nothing when  compared with the manifestations of Thy transcendent sovereignty, and are  destitute of all strength when face to face with the signs and tokens of  Thy power. What refuge is there beside Thee, O my Lord, to which I can  flee, and where is there a haven to which I can hasten? Nay, the power of  Thy might beareth me witness! No protector is there but Thee, no place to  flee to except Thee, no refuge to seek save Thee. Cause me to taste, O my  Lord, the divine sweetness of Thy remembrance and praise. I swear by Thy  might! Whosoever tasteth of its sweetness will rid himself of all  attachment to the world and all that is therein, and will set his face  towards Thee, cleansed from the remembrance of any one except Thee.    Inspire then my soul, O my God, with Thy wondrous remembrance, that I may  glorify Thy name. Number me not with them who read Thy words and fail to  find Thy hidden gift which, as decreed by Thee, is contained therein, and  which quickeneth the souls of Thy creatures and the hearts of Thy  servants. Cause me, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have been so  stirred up by the sweet savors that have been wafted in Thy days that they  have laid down their lives for Thee and hastened to the scene of their  death in their longing to gaze on Thy beauty and in their yearning to  attain Thy presence. And were any one to say unto them on their way,  \"Whither go ye?\" they would say, \"Unto God, the All-Possessing, the Help  in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!\"    The transgressions committed by such as have turned away from Thee and  have borne themselves haughtily towards Thee have not availed to hinder  them from loving Thee, and from setting their faces towards Thee, and from  turning in the direction of Thy mercy. These are they who are blessed by  the Concourse on high, who are glorified by the denizens of the  everlasting Cities, and beyond them by those on whose foreheads Thy most  exalted pen hath written: \"These! The people of Baha. Through them have  been shed the splendors of the light of guidance.\" Thus hath it been  ordained, at Thy behest and by Thy will, in the Tablet of Thine  irrevocable decree.    Proclaim, therefore, O my God, their greatness and the greatness of those  who while living or after death have circled round them. Supply them with  that which Thou hast ordained for the righteous among Thy creatures.  Potent art Thou to do all things. There is no God but Thee, the  All-Powerful, the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful.    Do not bring our fasts to an end with this fast, O my Lord, nor the  covenants Thou hast made with this covenant. Do Thou accept all that we  have done for love of Thee, and for the sake of Thy pleasure, and all that  we have left undone as a result of our subjection to our evil and corrupt  desires. Enable us, then, to cleave steadfastly to Thy love and Thy  good-pleasure, and preserve us from the mischief of such as have denied  Thee and repudiated Thy most resplendent signs. Thou art, in truth, the  Lord of this world and of the next. No God is there beside Thee, the  Exalted, the Most High.    Magnify Thou, O Lord my God, Him Who is the Primal Point, the Divine  Mystery, the Unseen Essence, the Day-Spring of Divinity, and the  Manifestation of Thy Lordship, through Whom all the knowledge of the past  and all the knowledge of the future were made plain, through Whom the  pearls of Thy hidden wisdom were uncovered, and the mystery of Thy  treasured name disclosed, Whom Thou hast appointed as the Announcer of the  One"]]]
