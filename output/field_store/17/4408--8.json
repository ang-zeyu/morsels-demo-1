The sea drove her higher upon the rocks,  and she careened so much that all the guns became useless. The  Tripolitans, seeing her helplessness, now came closer and increased  their fire.    There was no help for Captain Bainbridge. Unable to deliver an effective  shot, the enemy could kill every one of his men. He therefore flooded  his magazine, blocked the pumps, bored holes through the bottom of the  ship in order to sink her if his enemies succeeded in releasing her,  and then struck his flag. Distrustful at first, though they ceased  firing, the Tripolitans finally came aboard, plundered the officers and  men of their personal property, and then took them--three hundred and  fifteen in all--to the city, where they were lodged in prison.    Some days later a powerful northerly wind partly lifted the  _Philadelphia_ off the rocks, and by united efforts her captors  succeeded in getting her into deep water. The holes in the bottom were  plugged, and the guns and anchors that had been thrown overboard in the  shallow water were easily recovered and replaced on the ship. Thus the  Bashaw secured a most valuable prize.    The disaster gave a serious aspect to the war, for it not only added  material strength to the enemy, but increased their courage and insured  a more determined resistance on their part. While the loss was a severe  one to the American navy, it was not difficult to replace it.    One day a letter reached Commodore Preble. Apparently it was nothing but  a blank sheet of paper, but knowing that lemon juice had been employed  for ink, the Commodore held it before a flame and brought out the  following, in the handwriting of Bainbridge:    \"Charter a small merchant schooner, fill her with men and have her  commanded by fearless and determined officers. Let the vessel enter the  harbor at night with her men secreted below deck; steer her directly on  board the frigate, and then let the men and officers board, sword in  hand, and there is no doubt of their success. It will be necessary to  take several good rowboats in order to facilitate the retreat after the  enterprise has been accomplished. The frigate in her present condition  is a powerful auxiliary battery for the defence of the harbor. Though it  will be impossible to remove her from her anchorage and thus restore  this beautiful vessel to our navy, yet, as she may and no doubt will be  repaired, an important end will be gained by her destruction.\"    Captain Bainbridge had sent several similar letters to Preble, his good  friend, the Swedish consul, being the man who secured their delivery.  The plan suggested by Bainbridge was a good one, for, since it was  impossible to add the _Philadelphia_ to our navy, the next best thing  was to prevent her remaining with that of Tripoli. It may as well be  stated here that the court martial which investigated the particulars of  the loss of the _Philadelphia_ acquitted Captain Bainbridge of all blame  and declared that he had done everything possible under the  circumstances.    Fortunately, the American squadron succeeded about this time in  capturing a Tripolitan gunboat, which would serve admirably to disguise  the purpose of the Americans. Preble then told Lieutenant Decatur of the  suggestion made by Bainbridge. No sooner was the young lieutenant  acquainted with the plan than he volunteered to lead in the perilous  enterprise. Nothing could have suited the daring fellow better.    Lieutenant Charles Stewart, who arrived a short time before in the  _Siren_, not knowing of the scheme that had been formed, proposed with  the _Siren's_ men to cut out the _Philadelphia_. Preble informed him the  honor had been given to Decatur. Stewart was disappointed, but expressed  his honest pleasure that the management of the affair was entrusted to  such worthy hands.    \"He is the best man that could have been selected,\" he said heartily,  \"and there isn't a shadow of doubt that he will succeed.\"    Every one in the fleet was eager to volunteer, but Decatur selected  sixty-two men, to which were added six officers from the _Enterprise_  and six from the _Constitution_, with a native pilot. Knowing the daring  nature of Decatur, he was given strict orders not to attempt to cut out  the _Philadelphia_, but to destroy her.    Late in the day, February 9, 1804, the ketch left Syracuse for Tripoli,  accompanied by the _Siren_, Lieutenant Stewart, to cover the retreat.  The weather became so bad that the attempt had to be postponed, since  the ketch was sure to be dashed to pieces on the rocks. The impatient  crew was compelled to withdraw and wait for a week before the weather  moderated. On the 15th, everything being favorable, the crew of the  ketch bade good-by to their friends and set out on their perilous  mission.    The night was clear and starlit, and at nine o'clock the ketch was in  full view of the city and its twinkling lights, with the dark shores  crowded with batteries, while far ahead, under the guns of the Bashaw's  castle, lay the _Philadelphia_. The wind fell and the little craft crept  slowly through the water, seemingly into the very jaws of death, until  the outlines of the silent frigate loomed to sight through the gloom.  Following Decatur's guarded orders, the men lay flat on the deck, all  concealing themselves as best they could, while five or six, dressed as  Maltese sailors, lounged about in plain sight.    The quartermaster at the wheel, obeying the directions of Decatur,  steered so as to foul the _Philadelphia_, from which there suddenly came  a hail. Lieutenant Decatur whispered to the pilot to say they had just  arrived from Malta, and, having lost their anchor, wished to make fast  to the _Philadelphia's_ cables until another could be got from shore. A  brief conversation followed, during which the ketch edged closer, but  the Tripolitans soon discovered the men in the stargleam, and the alarm  was sounded; but with great coolness and haste the ketch was worked into  position and Decatur gave the order to board.    The eager Americans, with cutlass and boarding pike in hand, dashed  through the gun ports and over the bulwarks. In a twinkling the quarter  deck was cleared and all the Tripolitans on the forecastle were rushed  overboard. The noise brought up a number of Turks from below, but the  moment they saw what was going on they either leaped into the sea or hid  themselves in the hold. They were pursued, and within ten minutes the  frigate was captured, without a shot having been fired or an outcry  made.    An abundance of combustibles had been brought, and they were now  distributed and fired so effectively that nothing could save the fine  vessel. Then the Americans scrambled back to the ketch, Lieutenant  Decatur being the last to leave the doomed frigate, from which the  dazzling glare lit up the harbor and revealed the smaller boat straining  to get away. The batteries on shore opened fire, but, in their  excitement, they aimed wildly, and no harm was done. Every American  safely reached the _Siren_, waiting anxiously outside. The two made sail  for Syracuse, where Captain Preble was vastly relieved to hear the news.  The ketch was renamed the _Intrepid_, and Decatur, for his daring  exploit, was promoted to the rank of captain and presented with a sword  by Congress.    The _Philadelphia_ was totally destroyed, and its remains still lie at  the bottom of the harbor of Tripoli. In referring to this exploit, the  great English naval commander, Lord Nelson, said it was \"the most bold  and daring act of the age.\"          CHAPTER IX.    Bombardment of Tripoli--Treacherous Act of a Turkish Captain--A Quick  Retribution at the Hands of Captain Decatur.      The Bashaw of Tripoli was not yet subdued. He treated his American  prisoners with greater harshness and refused to believe their nation was  strong enough to bring him to terms.    On August 3, Commodore (as the senior officer of every squadron was then  called) Preble sailed into the harbor of Tripoli with his fleet and  opened the bombardment of the city. At the same time, several of his  gunboats engaged those of the enemy. Lieutenant James Decatur, brother  of Stephen, made chase of a Tripolitan vessel, reserving his fire until  the two almost touched, when he poured in such a destructive discharge  of musketry and grape that the terrified enemy surrendered. Lieutenant  Decatur sprang aboard of his prize, when, at that instant, the Turkish  commander, a man of massive strength and build, fired his pistol in the  American officer's face and killed him. In the confusion caused by this  treacherous act the enemy's boat got away and started for the city.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN STEPHEN DECATUR.]    Meanwhile, Captain Decatur had been doing characteristic work. With  three gunboats he attacked a force three times as numerous as his own.  Impetuously boarding the first craft, after a discharge from his long  boat, he engaged the numerous crew in a furious hand-to-hand struggle,  in which all were made prisoners or forced to leap into the sea to save  themselves. Then Decatur began towing away his prize, when he was told  of the murder of his brother.    The grief-stricken and enraged captain instantly cast his prize adrift  and started after the \"unspeakable Turk.\" The boat was easily  recognized, and, delivering a destructive fire, the pursuer ran  alongside and the Americans rushed aboard, with Decatur in the lead. The  enormous size and gorgeous uniform of the Turkish captain made him so  conspicuous that Decatur knew him at once, and, rushing forward, lunged  at him with his boarding pike. The Turk must have felt contempt for the  American who dared thus to assail him, for his assailant was but a boy  in size compared to him. He speedily proved his physical superiority  over Decatur, for he not only parried the lunge of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#12)"],[1," and the inward and outward worlds of which they  are the organs are parted by a wall, and appear as if they could never  be confounded. The mind is endued with faculties, habits, instincts, and  a personality or consciousness in which they are bound together. Over  against these are placed forms, colours, external bodies coming into  contact with our own body. We speak of a subject which is ourselves,  of an object which is all the rest. These are separable in thought, but  united in any act of sensation, reflection, or volition. As there are  various degrees in which the mind may enter into or be abstracted from  the operations of sense, so there are various points at which this  separation or union may be supposed to occur. And within the sphere  of mind the analogy of sense reappears; and we distinguish not only  external objects, but objects of will and of knowledge which we contrast  with them. These again are comprehended in a higher object, which  reunites with the subject. A multitude of abstractions are created by  the efforts of successive thinkers which become logical determinations;  and they have to be arranged in order, before the scheme of thought is  complete. The framework of the human intellect is not the peculium of  an individual, but the joint work of many who are of all ages and  countries. What we are in mind is due, not merely to our physical, but  to our mental antecedents which we trace in history, and more especially  in the history of philosophy. Nor can mental phenomena be truly  explained either by physiology or by the observation of consciousness  apart from their history. They have a growth of their own, like the  growth of a flower, a tree, a human being. They may be conceived as of  themselves constituting a common mind, and having a sort of personal  identity in which they coexist.    So comprehensive is modern psychology, seeming to aim at constructing  anew the entire world of thought. And prior to or simultaneously with  this construction a negative process has to be carried on, a clearing  away of useless abstractions which we have inherited from the past. Many  erroneous conceptions of the mind derived from former philosophies  have found their way into language, and we with difficulty disengage  ourselves from them. Mere figures of speech have unconsciously  influenced the minds of great thinkers. Also there are some  distinctions, as, for example, that of the will and of the reason, and  of the moral and intellectual faculties, which are carried further than  is justified by experience. Any separation of things which we cannot see  or exactly define, though it may be necessary, is a fertile source of  error. The division of the mind into faculties or powers or virtues is  too deeply rooted in language to be got rid of, but it gives a false  impression. For if we reflect on ourselves we see that all our faculties  easily pass into one another, and are bound together in a single mind or  consciousness; but this mental unity is apt to be concealed from us by  the distinctions of language.    A profusion of words and ideas has obscured rather than enlightened  mental science. It is hard to say how many fallacies have arisen from  the representation of the mind as a box, as a 'tabula rasa,' a book,  a mirror, and the like. It is remarkable how Plato in the Theaetetus,  after having indulged in the figure of the waxen tablet and the decoy,  afterwards discards them. The mind is also represented by another class  of images, as the spring of a watch, a motive power, a breath, a stream,  a succession of points or moments. As Plato remarks in the Cratylus,  words expressive of motion as well as of rest are employed to describe  the faculties and operations of the mind; and in these there is  contained another store of fallacies. Some shadow or reflection of the  body seems always to adhere to our thoughts about ourselves, and mental  processes are hardly distinguished in language from bodily ones. To see  or perceive are used indifferently of both; the words intuition, moral  sense, common sense, the mind's eye, are figures of speech transferred  from one to the other. And many other words used in early poetry or in  sacred writings to express the works of mind have a materialistic sound;  for old mythology was allied to sense, and the distinction of matter and  mind had not as yet arisen. Thus materialism receives an illusive aid  from language; and both in philosophy and religion the imaginary figure  or association easily takes the place of real knowledge.    Again, there is the illusion of looking into our own minds as if our  thoughts or feelings were written down in a book. This is another figure  of speech, which might be appropriately termed 'the fallacy of the  looking-glass.' We cannot look at the mind unless we have the eye  which sees, and we can only look, not into, but out of the mind at  the thoughts, words, actions of ourselves and others. What we dimly  recognize within us is not experience, but rather the suggestion of an  experience, which we may gather, if we will, from the observation of the  world. The memory has but a feeble recollection of what we were saying  or doing a few weeks or a few months ago, and still less of what we  were thinking or feeling. This is one among many reasons why there is  so little self-knowledge among mankind; they do not carry with them  the thought of what they are or have been. The so-called 'facts of  consciousness' are equally evanescent; they are facts which nobody ever  saw, and which can neither be defined nor described. Of the three laws  of thought the first (All A = A) is an identical proposition--that is to  say, a mere word or symbol claiming to be a proposition: the two others  (Nothing can be A and not A, and Everything is either A or not A) are  untrue, because they exclude degrees and also the mixed modes and double  aspects under which truth is so often presented to us. To assert that  man is man is unmeaning; to say that he is free or necessary and cannot  be both is a half truth only. These are a few of the entanglements which  impede the natural course of human thought. Lastly, there is the fallacy  which lies still deeper, of regarding the individual mind apart from  the universal, or either, as a self-existent entity apart from the ideas  which are contained in them.    In ancient philosophies the analysis of the mind is still rudimentary  and imperfect. It naturally began with an effort to disengage the  universal from sense--this was the first lifting up of the mist. It  wavered between object and subject, passing imperceptibly from one or  Being to mind and thought. Appearance in the outward object was for a  time indistinguishable from opinion in the subject. At length mankind  spoke of knowing as well as of opining or perceiving. But when the word  'knowledge' was found how was it to be explained or defined? It was not  an error, it was a step in the right direction, when Protagoras said  that 'Man is the measure of all things,' and that 'All knowledge is  perception.' This was the subjective which corresponded to the objective  'All is flux.' But the thoughts of men deepened, and soon they began  to be aware that knowledge was neither sense, nor yet opinion--with or  without explanation; nor the expression of thought, nor the enumeration  of parts, nor the addition of characteristic marks. Motion and rest were  equally ill adapted to express its nature, although both must in some  sense be attributed to it; it might be described more truly as the mind  conversing with herself; the discourse of reason; the hymn of dialectic,  the science of relations, of ideas, of the so-called arts and sciences,  of the one, of the good, of the all:--this is the way along which Plato  is leading us in his later dialogues. In its higher signification it was  the knowledge, not of men, but of gods, perfect and all sufficing:--like  other ideals always passing out of sight, and nevertheless present to  the mind of Aristotle as well as Plato, and the reality to which they  were both tending. For Aristotle as well as Plato would in modern  phraseology have been termed a mystic; and like him would have defined  the higher philosophy to be 'Knowledge of being or essence,'--words to  which in our own day we have a difficulty in attaching a meaning.    Yet, in spite of Plato and his followers, mankind have again and again  returned to a sensational philosophy. As to some of the early thinkers,  amid the fleetings of sensible objects, ideas alone seemed to be fixed,  so to a later generation amid the fluctuation of philosophical opinions  the only fixed points appeared to be outward objects. Any pretence  of knowledge which went beyond them implied logical processes, of the  correctness of which they had no assurance and which at best were only  probable. The mind, tired of wandering, sought to rest on firm ground;  when the idols of philosophy and language were stripped off, the  perception of outward objects alone remained. The ancient Epicureans  never asked whether the comparison of these with one another did not  involve principles of another kind which were above and beyond them. In  like manner the modern inductive philosophy forgot to enquire into  the meaning of experience, and did not attempt to form a conception of  outward objects apart from the mind, or of the mind apart from them.  Soon objects of sense were merged in sensations and feelings, but  feelings and sensations were still unanalyzed. At last we return to  the doctrine attributed by Plato to Protagoras, that the mind is only a  succession of momentary perceptions. At this point the modern philosophy  of experience forms an alliance with ancient scepticism.    The higher truths of philosophy and religion are very far removed from  sense. Admitting that, like all other knowledge, they are derived from  experience, and that experience is ultimately"]]]
