The  biggest, and maybe the best thing in the way of vegetables that we had  then was the white-head cabbage; they grew large up there in Carolina  where I lived. There was just one big garden to feed all the folks on  that farm.    \"Marse George had a good 'possum dog that he let his slaves use at  night. They would start off hunting about 10 o'clock. Darkies knew that  the best place to hunt for 'possums was in a persimmon tree. If they  couldn't shake him out, they would cut the tree down, but the most fun  was when we found the 'possum in a hollow log. Some of the hunters would  get at one end of the log, and the others would guard the other end, and  they would build a fire to smoke the 'possum out. Sometimes when they  had to pull him out, they would find the 'possum in such a tight place  that most of his hair would be rubbed off before they could get him out.  Darkies hunted rabbits, squirrels, coons, all kinds of birds, and  'specially they was fond of going after wild turkeys. Another great  sport was hunting deer in the nearby mountains. I managed to get a shot  at one once. Marse George was right good about letting his darkies hunt  and fish at night to get meat for themselves. Oh! Sure, there were lots  of fish and they caught plenty of 'em in the Little Tennessee and Sugar  Fork Rivers and in the numerous creeks that were close by. Red horse,  suckers, and salmon are the kinds of fish I remember best. They were  cooked in various ways in skillets, spiders, and ovens on the big open  fireplace.    \"Now, about the clothes we wore in the days of the war, I couldn't  rightly say, but my Mother said we had good comfortable garments. In the  summer weather, boys and men wore plain cotton shirts and jeans pants.  The home-made linsey-woolsy shirts that we wore over our cotton shirts,  and the wool pants that we wore in winter, were good and warm; they had  brogan shoes in winter too. Folks wore the same clothes on Sundays as  through the week, but they had to be sure that they were nice and clean  on Sundays. Dresses for the women folks were made out of cotton checks,  and they had sunbonnets too.    \"Marse George Sellars, him that married Miss Ca'line Angel, was my real  master. They had four children, Bud, Mount, Elizabeth, and, and er; I  just can't bring to recollect the name of their other girl. They lived  in a two-story frame house that was surrounded by an oak grove on the  road leading from Franklin, North Carolina, to Clayton, Georgia. Hard  Sellars was the carriage driver, and while I am sure Marse George must  have had an overseer, I don't remember ever hearing anybody say his  name.    \"Really, Miss, I couldn't say just how big that plantation was, but I am  sure there must have been at least four or five hundred acres in it. One  mighty peculiar thing about his slaves was that Marse George never had  more than 99 slaves at one time; every time he bought one to try to make  it an even hundred, a slave died. This happened so often, I was told,  that he stopped trying to keep a hundred or more, and held on to his 99  slaves, and long as he did that, there warn't any more deaths than  births among his slaves. His slaves had to be in the fields when the sun  rose, and there they had to work steady until the sun went down. Oh!  Yes, mam, Marse Tommy Angel was mighty mean to his slaves, but Miss  Jenny, his sister, was good as could be; that is the reason she gave my  mother to her sister, Miss Ca'line Sellars; because she thought Marse  Tommy was too hard on her.    \"I heard some talk as to how after the slaves had worked hard in the  field all day and come to the house at night, they were whipped for  mighty small offenses. Marse George would have them tied hand and foot  over a barrel and would beat them with a cowhide, or cat-o'-nine tails  lash. They had a jail in Franklin as far back as I can recollect. Old  Big Andy Angel's white folks had him put in jail a heap of times,  because he was a rogue and stole everything he could get his hands on.  Nearly everybody was afraid of him; he was a great big double jointed  man, and was black as the ace of spades. No, mam, I never saw any slaves  sold, but my father's mother and his sister were sold on the block. The  white folks that bought 'em took them away. After the war was over my  father tried to locate 'em, but never once did he get on the right track  of 'em.    \"Oh! Why, my white folks took a great deal of pains teaching their  slaves how to read and write. My father could read, but he never learned  to write, and it was from our white folks that I learned to read and  write. Slaves read the Bible more than anything else. There were no  churches for slaves on Marse George's plantation, so we all went to the  white folks' church, about two miles away; it was called Clarke's  Chapel. Sometimes we went to church at Cross Roads; that was about the  same distance across Sugar Fork River. My mother was baptized in that  Sugar Fork River by a white preacher, but that is the reason I joined  the Baptist church, because my mother was a Baptist, and I was so crazy  about her, and am 'til yet.    \"There were no funeral parlors in those days. They just funeralized the  dead in their own homes, took them to the graveyard in a painted  home-made coffin that was lined with thin bleaching made in the loom on  the plantation, and buried them in a grave that didn't have any bricks  or cement about it. That brings to my memory those songs they sung at  funerals. One of them started off something like this, _I Don't Want You  to Grieve After Me_. My mother used to tell me that when she was  baptized they sung, _You Shall Wear a Lily-White Robe_. Whenever I get  to studying about her it seems to me I can hear my mother singing that  song again. She did love it so much.    \"No, mam, there didn't none of the darkies on Marse George Sellar's  place run away to the North, but some on Marse Tommy Angel's place ran  to the West. They told me that when Little Charles Angel started out to  run away a bird flew in front of him and led him all the way to the  West. Understand me, I am not saying that is strictly so, but that is  what I heard old folks say, when I was young. When darkies wanted to get  news to their girls or wives on other plantations and didn't want Marse  George to know about it, they would wait for a dark night and would tie  rags on their feet to keep from making any noise that the paterollers  might hear, for if they were caught out without a pass, that was  something else. Paterollers would go out in squads at night and whip any  darkies they caught out that could not show passes. Adam Angel was a  great big man, weighing about 200 pounds, and he slipped out one night  without a pass. When the paterollers found him, he was at his girl's  place where they were out in the front yard stewing lard for the white  folks. They knew he didn't belong on that plantation, so they asked him  to show his pass. Adam didn't have one with him, and he told them so.  They made a dive for him, and then, quick as a flash, he turned over  that pot of boiling lard, and while they were getting the hot grease off  of them he got away and came back to his cabin. If they had caught Adam,  he would have needed some of that spilt grease on him after the beating  they would have give him. Darkies used to stretch ropes and grapevines  across the road where they knew paterollers would be riding; then they  would run down the road in front of them, and when they got to the rope  or vine they would jump over it and watch the horses stumble and throw  the paterollers to the ground. That was a favorite sport of slaves.    \"After the darkies got in from the field at night, ate their supper, and  finished up the chores for the day, on nights when the moon shone bright  the men would work in their own cotton patches that Marse George allowed  them; the women used their own time to wash, iron, patch, and get ready  for the next day, and if they had time they helped the men in their  cotton patches. They worked straight on through Saturdays, same as any  other day, but the young folks would get together on Saturday nights and  have little parties.    \"How did they spend Sundays? Why, they went to church on Sunday and  visited around, holding prayermeetings at one another's cabins. Now,  Christmas morning! Yes, mam, that was a powerful time with the darkies,  if they didn't have nothing but a little sweet cake, which was nothing  more than gingerbread. However, Marse George did have plenty of good  things to eat at that time, such as fresh pork and wild turkeys, and we  were allowed to have a biscuit on that day. How we did frolic and cut up  at Christmas! Marse George didn't make much special to do on New Year's  Day as far as holiday was concerned; work was the primary object,  especially in connection with slaves.    \"Oh-oo-h! Everybody had cornshuckings. The man designated to act as the  general would stick a peacock tail feather in his hat and call all the  men together and give his orders. He would stand in the center of the  corn pile, start the singing, and keep things lively for them. Now and  then he would pass around the jug. They sang a great deal during  cornshuckings, but I have forgotten the words to those songs. Great  excitement was expressed whenever a man found a red ear of corn, for  that counted 20 points, a speckled ear was 10 points and a blue ear 5  points, toward a special extra big swig of liquor whenever a person had  as many as 100 points. After the work was finished they had a big feast  spread on long tables in the yard, and dram flowed plentiful, then they  played ball, tussled, ran races, and did anything they knew how to amuse  themselves.    \"Now, Ladies,\" John said, \"please excuse me. I left my wife at home real  sick, and I just must hurry to the drug store and get some "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#12)"],[1,"market; and on accidentally  meeting with Lord Daer, he immediately commemorated the event in a  sally of verse, of a strain more free and yet as flattering as ever  flowed from the lips of a court bard. While musing over the names of  those on whom fortune had smiled, yet who had neglected to smile on  him, he remembered that he had met Miss Alexander, a young beauty of  the west, in the walks of Ballochmyle; and he recorded the impression  which this fair vision made on him in a song of unequalled elegance  and melody. He had met her in the woods in July, on the 18th of  November he sent her the song, and reminded her of the circumstance  from which it arose, in a letter which it is evident he had laboured  to render polished and complimentary. The young lady took no notice of  either the song or the poet, though willing, it is said, to hear of  both now:--this seems to have been the last attempt he made on the  taste or the sympathies of the gentry of his native district: for on  the very day following we find him busy in making arrangements for his  departure to Jamaica.    For this step Burns had more than sufficient reasons: the profits of  his volume amounted to little more than enough to waft him across the  Atlantic: Wee Johnnie, though the edition was all sold, refused to  risk another on speculation: his friends, both Ballantynes and  Parkers, volunteered to relieve the printer's anxieties, but the poet  declined their bounty, and gloomily indented himself in a ship about  to sail from Greenock, and called on his muse to take farewell of  Caledonia, in the last song he ever expected to measure in his native  land. That fine lyric, beginning \"The gloomy night is gathering fast,\"  was the offspring of these moments of regret and sorrow. His feelings  were not expressed in song alone: he remembered his mother and his  natural daughter, and made an assignment of all that pertained to him  at Mossgiel--and that was but little--and of all the advantage which a  cruel, unjust, and insulting law allowed in the proceeds of his poems,  for their support and behoof. This document was publicly read in the  presence of the poet, at the market-cross of Ayr, by his friend  William Chalmers, a notary public. Even this step was to Burns one of  danger: some ill-advised person had uncoupled the merciless pack of  the law at his heels, and he was obliged to shelter himself as he best  could, in woods, it is said, by day and in barns by night, till the  final hour of his departure came. That hour arrived, and his chest was  on the way to the ship, when a letter was put into his hand which  seemed to light him to brighter prospects.    Among the friends whom his merits had procured him was Dr. Laurie, a  district clergyman, who had taste enough to admire the deep  sensibilities as well as the humour of the poet, and the generosity to  make known both his works and his worth to the warm-hearted and  amiable Blacklock, who boldly proclaimed him a poet of the first rank,  and lamented that he was not in Edinburgh to publish another edition  of his poems. Burns was ever a man of impulse: he recalled his chest  from Greenock; he relinquished the situation he had accepted on the  estate of one Douglas; took a secret leave of his mother, and, without  an introduction to any one, and unknown personally to all, save to  Dugald Stewart, away he walked, through Glenap, to Edinburgh, full of  new hope and confiding in his genius. When he arrived, he scarcely  knew what to do: he hesitated to call on the professor; he refrained  from making himself known, as it has been supposed he did, to the  enthusiastic Blacklock; but, sitting down in an obscure lodging, he  sought out an obscure printer, recommended by a humble comrade from  Kyle, and began to negotiate for a new edition of the Poems of the  Ayrshire Ploughman. This was not the way to go about it: his barge had  well nigh been shipwrecked in the launch; and he might have lived to  regret the letter which hindered his voyage to Jamaica, had he not met  by chance in the street a gentleman of the west, of the name of  Dalzell, who introduced him to the Earl of Glencairn, a nobleman whose  classic education did not hurt his taste for Scottish poetry, and who  was not too proud to lend his helping hand to a rustic stranger of  such merit as Burns. Cunningham carried him to Creech, then the Murray  of Edinburgh, a shrewd man of business, who opened the poet's eyes to  his true interests: the first proposals, then all but issued, were put  in the fire, and new ones printed and diffused over the island. The  subscription was headed by half the noblemen of the north: the  Caledonian Hunt, through the interest of Glencairn, took six hundred  copies: duchesses and countesses swelled the list, and such a crowding  to write down names had not been witnessed since the signing of the  solemn league and covenant.    While the subscription-papers were filling and the new volume printing  on a paper and in a type worthy of such high patronage, Burns remained  in Edinburgh, where, for the winter season, he was a lion, and one of an  unwonted kind. Philosophers, historians, and scholars had shaken the  elegant coteries of the city with their wit, or enlightened them with  their learning, but they were all men who had been polished by polite  letters or by intercourse with high life, and there was a sameness in  their very dress as well as address, of which peers and peeresses had  become weary. They therefore welcomed this rustic candidate for the  honour of giving wings to their hours of lassitude and weariness, with a  welcome more than common; and when his approach was announced, the  polished circle looked for the advent of a lout from the plough, in  whose uncouth manners and embarrassed address they might find matter  both for mirth and wonder. But they met with a barbarian who was not at  all barbarous: as the poet met in Lord Daer feelings and sentiments as  natural as those of a ploughman, so they met in a ploughman manners  worthy of a lord: his air was easy and unperplexed: his address was  perfectly well-bred, and elegant in its simplicity: he felt neither  eclipsed by the titled nor struck dumb before the learned and the  eloquent, but took his station with the ease and grace of one born to  it. In the society of men alone he spoke out: he spared neither his wit,  his humour, nor his sarcasm--he seemed to say to all--\"I am a man, and  you are no more; and why should I not act and speak like one?\"--it was  remarked, however, that he had not learnt, or did not desire, to conceal  his emotions--that he commended with more rapture than was courteous,  and contradicted with more bluntness than was accounted polite. It was  thus with him in the company of men: when woman approached, his look  altered, his eye beamed milder; all that was stern in his nature  underwent a change, and he received them with deference, but with a  consciousness that he could win their attention as he had won that of  others, who differed, indeed, from them only in the texture of their  kirtles. This natural power of rendering himself acceptable to women had  been observed and envied by Sillar, one of the dearest of his early  comrades; and it stood him in good stead now, when he was the object to  whom the Duchess of Gordon, the loveliest as well as the wittiest of  women--directed her discourse. Burns, she afterwards said, won the  attention of the Edinburgh ladies by a deferential way of address--by an  ease and natural grace of manners, as new as it was unexpected--that he  told them the stories of some of his tenderest songs or liveliest poems  in a style quite magical--enriching his little narratives, which had one  and all the merit of being short, with personal incidents of humour or  of pathos.    In a party, when Dr. Blair and Professor Walker were present, Burns  related the circumstances under which he had composed his melancholy  song, \"The gloomy night is gathering fast,\" in a way even more  touching than the verses: and in the company of the ruling beauties of  the time, he hesitated not to lift the veil from some of the tenderer  parts of his own history, and give them glimpses of the romance of  rustic life. A lady of birth--one of his must willing listeners--used,  I am told, to say, that she should never forget the tale which he  related of his affection for Mary Campbell, his Highland Mary, as he  loved to call her. She was fair, he said, and affectionate, and as  guileless as she was beautiful; and beautiful he thought her in a very  high degree. The first time he saw her was during one of his musing  walks in the woods of Montgomery Castle; and the first time he spoke  to her was during the merriment of a harvest-kirn. There were others  there who admired her, but he addressed her, and had the luck to win  her regard from them all. He soon found that she was the lass whom he  had long sought, but never before found--that her good looks were  surpassed by her good sense; and her good sense was equalled by her  discretion and modesty. He met her frequently: she saw by his looks  that he was sincere; she put full trust in his love, and used to  wander with him among the green knowes and stream-banks till the sun  went down and the moon rose, talking, dreaming of love and the golden  days which awaited them. He was poor, and she had only her half-year's  fee, for she was in the condition of a servant; but thoughts of gear  never darkened their dream: they resolved to wed, and exchanged vows  of constancy and love. They plighted their vows on the Sabbath to  render them more sacred--they made them by a burn, where they had  courted, that open nature might be a witness--they made them over an  open Bible, to show that they thought of God in this mutual act--and  when they had done they both took water in their hands, and scattered  it in the air, to intimate that as the stream was pure so"]]]
