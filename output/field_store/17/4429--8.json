She ran at once to  tell Christine, who hurried down and, with the help of the landlady,  did her best to revive him.  He soon opened his eyes and was not long  in recovering when he saw his friend's charming face leaning over him.    A few weeks later, when the tragedy at the Opera compelled the  intervention of the public prosecutor, M. Mifroid, the commissary of  police, examined the Vicomte de Chagny touching the events of the night  at Perros.  I quote the questions and answers as given in the official  report pp. 150 et seq.:    Q. \"Did Mlle. Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious  road which you selected?\"    R. \"No, monsieur, no, although, when walking behind her, I took no  pains to deaden the sound of my footsteps.  In fact, I was anxious that  she should turn round and see me.  I realized that I had no excuse for  following her and that this way of spying on her was unworthy of me.  But she seemed not to hear me and acted exactly as though I were not  there.  She quietly left the quay and then suddenly walked quickly up  the road.  The church-clock had struck a quarter to twelve and I  thought that this must have made her hurry, for she began almost to run  and continued hastening until she came to the church.\"    Q. \"Was the gate open?\"    R. \"Yes, monsieur, and this surprised me, but did not seem to surprise  Mlle. Daae.\"    Q. \"Was there no one in the churchyard?\"    R. \"I did not see any one; and, if there had been, I must have seen  him.  The moon was shining on the snow and made the night quite light.\"    Q. \"Was it possible for any one to hide behind the tombstones?\"    R. \"No, monsieur.  They were quite small, poor tombstones, partly  hidden under the snow, with their crosses just above the level of the  ground.  The only shadows were those of the crosses and ourselves.  The  church stood out quite brightly.  I never saw so clear a night.  It was  very fine and very cold and one could see everything.\"    Q. \"Are you at all superstitious?\"    R. \"No, monsieur, I am a practising Catholic,\"    Q. \"In what condition of mind were you?\"    R. \"Very healthy and peaceful, I assure you.  Mlle. Daae's curious  action in going out at that hour had worried me at first; but, as soon  as I saw her go to the churchyard, I thought that she meant to fulfil  some pious duty on her father's grave and I considered this so natural  that I recovered all my calmness.  I was only surprised that she had  not heard me walking behind her, for my footsteps were quite audible on  the hard snow.  But she must have been taken up with her intentions and  I resolved not to disturb her.  She knelt down by her father's grave,  made the sign of the cross and began to pray.  At that moment, it  struck midnight.  At the last stroke, I saw Mlle. Daae life{sic} her  eyes to the sky and stretch out her arms as though in ecstasy.  I was  wondering what the reason could be, when I myself raised my head and  everything within me seemed drawn toward the invisible, WHICH WAS  PLAYING THE MOST PERFECT MUSIC!  Christine and I knew that music; we  had heard it as children.  But it had never been executed with such  divine art, even by M. Daae.  I remembered all that Christine had told  me of the Angel of Music.  The air was The Resurrection of Lazarus,  which old M. Daae used to play to us in his hours of melancholy and of  faith.  If Christine's Angel had existed, he could not have played  better, that night, on the late musician's violin.  When the music  stopped, I seemed to hear a noise from the skulls in the heap of bones;  it was as though they were chuckling and I could not help shuddering.\"    Q. \"Did it not occur to you that the musician might be hiding behind  that very heap of bones?\"    R. \"It was the one thought that did occur to me, monsieur, so much so  that I omitted to follow Mlle. Daae, when she stood up and walked  slowly to the gate.  She was so much absorbed just then that I am not  surprised that she did not see me.\"    Q. \"Then what happened that you were found in the morning lying  half-dead on the steps of the high altar?\"    R. \"First a skull rolled to my feet ... then another ... then another  ... It was as if I were the mark of that ghastly game of bowls.  And I  had an idea that false step must have destroyed the balance of the  structure behind which our musician was concealed.  This surmise seemed  to be confirmed when I saw a shadow suddenly glide along the sacristy  wall.  I ran up.  The shadow had already pushed open the door and  entered the church.  But I was quicker than the shadow and caught hold  of a corner of its cloak.  At that moment, we were just in front of the  high altar; and the moonbeams fell straight upon us through the  stained-glass windows of the apse.  As I did not let go of the cloak,  the shadow turned round; and I saw a terrible death's head, which  darted a look at me from a pair of scorching eyes.  I felt as if I were  face to face with Satan; and, in the presence of this unearthly  apparition, my heart gave way, my courage failed me ... and I remember  nothing more until I recovered consciousness at the Setting Sun.\"        Chapter VI  A Visit to Box Five      We left M. Firmin Richard and M. Armand Moncharmin at the moment when  they were deciding \"to look into that little matter of Box Five.\"    Leaving behind them the broad staircase which leads from the lobby  outside the managers' offices to the stage and its dependencies, they  crossed the stage, went out by the subscribers' door and entered the  house through the first little passage on the left.  Then they made  their way through the front rows of stalls and looked at Box Five on  the grand tier, They could not see it well, because it was half in  darkness and because great covers were flung over the red velvet of the  ledges of all the boxes.    They were almost alone in the huge, gloomy house; and a great silence  surrounded them.  It was the time when most of the stage-hands go out  for a drink.  The staff had left the boards for the moment, leaving a  scene half set.  A few rays of light, a wan, sinister light, that  seemed to have been stolen from an expiring luminary, fell through some  opening or other upon an old tower that raised its pasteboard  battlements on the stage; everything, in this deceptive light, adopted  a fantastic shape.  In the orchestra stalls, the drugget covering them  looked like an angry sea, whose glaucous waves had been suddenly  rendered stationary by a secret order from the storm phantom, who, as  everybody knows, is called Adamastor.  MM. Moncharmin and Richard were  the shipwrecked mariners amid this motionless turmoil of a calico sea.  They made for the left boxes, plowing their way like sailors who leave  their ship and try to struggle to the shore.  The eight great polished  columns stood up in the dusk like so many huge piles supporting the  threatening, crumbling, big-bellied cliffs whose layers were  represented by the circular, parallel, waving lines of the balconies of  the grand, first and second tiers of boxes.  At the top, right on top  of the cliff, lost in M. Lenepveu's copper ceiling, figures grinned and  grimaced, laughed and jeered at MM. Richard and Moncharmin's distress.  And yet these figures were usually very serious.  Their names were  Isis, Amphitrite, Hebe, Pandora, Psyche, Thetis, Pomona, Daphne,  Clytie, Galatea and Arethusa.  Yes, Arethusa herself and Pandora, whom  we all know by her box, looked down upon the two new managers of the  Opera, who ended by clutching at some piece of wreckage and from there  stared silently at Box Five on the grand tier.    I have said that they were distressed.  At least, I presume so.  M.  Moncharmin, in any case, admits that he was impressed.  To quote his  own words, in his Memoirs:    \"This moonshine about the Opera ghost in which, since we first took  over the duties of MM. Poligny and Debienne, we had been so nicely  steeped\"--Moncharmin's style is not always irreproachable--\"had no  doubt ended by blinding my imaginative and also my visual faculties.  It may be that the exceptional surroundings in which we found  ourselves, in the midst of an incredible silence, impressed us to an  unusual extent.  It may be that we were the sport of a kind of  hallucination brought about by the semi-darkness of the theater and the  partial gloom that filled Box Five.  At any rate, I saw and Richard  also saw a shape in the box.  Richard said nothing, nor I either.  But  we spontaneously seized each other's hand.  We stood like that for some  minutes, without moving, with our eyes fixed on the same point; but the  figure had disappeared.  Then we went out and, in the lobby,  communicated our impressions to each other and talked about 'the  shape.'  The misfortune was that my shape was not in the least like  Richard's. I had seen a thing like a death's head resting on the ledge  of the box, whereas Richard saw the shape of an old woman who looked  like Mme. Giry.  We soon discovered that we had really been the victims  of an illusion, whereupon, without further delay and laughing like  madmen, we ran to Box Five on the grand tier, went inside and found no  shape of any kind.\"    Box Five is just like all the other grand tier boxes.  There is nothing  to distinguish it from any of the others.  M. Moncharmin and M.  Richard, ostensibly highly amused and laughing at each other, moved the  furniture of the box, lifted the cloths and the chairs and particularly  examined the arm-chair in which \"the man's voice\" used to sit.  But  they saw that it was a respectable arm-chair, with no magic about it.  Altogether, the box was the most ordinary box in the world, with its  red hangings, its chairs, its carpet and its ledge covered in red  velvet.  After, feeling the carpet in the most serious manner possible,  and discovering nothing more here or anywhere else, they went down to  the corresponding box on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#12)"],[1,"e. And if you stop to  think it over, perhaps you can understand how they felt.    Here was a child who had never played,  \"London-Bridge-is-falling-down\" or jackstones or jump-rope or  hop-scotch. Yet she talked familiarly of automobiles, yachts and horses.  She knew nothing about geography and yet, her conversation was full of  such phrases as \"The spring we were in Paris\" or \"The winter we spent  in Rome.\" She knew nothing about nouns and verbs but she talked Italian  fluently with the hand-organ man who came every week and many of her books  were in French. She knew nothing about fractions or decimals, yet she  referred familiarly to \"drawing checks,\" to gold eagles and to Wall  Street. Her writing was so bad that the children made fun of it, yet  she could spin off a letter of eight pages in a flash. And she told  the most wonderful fairy-tales that had ever been heard in Primrose  Court.    Because of all these things the children had a kind of contempt for  her mingled with a curious awe.    She was so polite with grown people that it was fairly embarrassing.  She always arose from her chair when they entered the room, always  picked up the things they dropped and never interrupted. And yet she  could carry on a long conversation with them. She never said, \"Yes,  ma'am,\" or \"No, ma'am.\" Instead, she said, \"Yes, Mrs. Brine,\" or  \"No, Miss Allison,\" and she looked whomever she was talking with  straight in the eye.    She would play with the little children as willingly as with the  bigger ones. Often when the older girls and boys were in school, she  would bring out a lapful of toys and spend the whole morning with  the little ones. When Granny called her, she would give all the toys  away, dividing them with a careful justice. And, yet, whenever  children bought things of her in the shop, she always expected them  to pay the whole price. You can see how the neighborhood would  fairly buzz with talk about her.    As for Maida--with all this newness of friend-making and out-of-doors  games, it is not to be wondered that her head was a jumble at the  end of each day. In that delicious, dozy interval before she fell  asleep at night, all kinds of pretty pictures seemed to paint  themselves on her eyelids.    Now it was Rose-Red swaying like a great overgrown scarlet flower  from the bars of a lamp-post. Now it was Dicky hoisting himself  along on his crutches, his face alight with his radiant smile. Now  it was a line of laughing, rosy-cheeked children, as long as the  tail of a kite, pelting to goal at the magic cry \"Liberty poles are  bending!\" Or it was a group of little girls, setting out rows and  rows of bright-colored paper-dolls among the shadows of one of the  deep old doorways. But always in a few moments came the sweetest  kind of sleep. And always through her dreams flowed the plaintive  music of \"Go in and out the windows.\" Often she seemed to wake in  the morning to the Clarion cry, \"Hoist the sail!\"    It did not seem to Maida that the days were long enough to do all  the things she wanted to do.                                    CHAPTER VI: TWO CALLS      One morning, Laura Lathrop came bustling importantly into the shop.  \"Good morning, Maida,\" she said; \"you may come over to my house this  afternoon and play with me if you'd like.\"    \"Thank you, Laura,\" Maida answered. To anybody else, she would have  added, \"I shall be delighted to come.\" But to Laura, she only said,  \"It is kind of you to ask me.\"    \"From about two until four,\" Laura went on in her most superior  tone. \"I suppose you can't get off for much longer than that.\"    \"Granny is always willing to wait on customers if I want to play,\"  Maida explained, \"but I think she would not want me to stay longer  than that, anyway.\"    \"Very well, then. Shall we say at two?\" Laura said this with a very  grown-up air. Maida knew that she was imitating her mother.    Laura had scarcely left when Dicky appeared, swinging between his  crutches. \"Maida,\" he said, \"I want you to come over to-morrow  afternoon and see my place. You've not seen Delia yet and there's a  whole lot of things I want to show you. I'm going to clean house  to-day so's I'll be all ready for you to-morrow.\"    \"Oh, thank you,\" Maida said. The sparkle that always meant delight  came into her face. \"I shall be delighted. I've always wanted to go  over and see you ever since I first knew you. But Granny said to  wait until you invited me. And I really have never seen Delia except  when Rosie's had her in the carriage. And then she's always been  asleep.\"    \"You have to see Delia in the house to know what a naughty baby she  is,\" Dicky said. He spoke as if that were the finest tribute that he  could pay his little sister.    \"Granny,\" Maida said that noon at lunch, \"Laura Lathrop came here  and invited me to come to see her this afternoon and I just hate the  thought of going--I don't know why. Then Dicky came and invited me to  come and see him to-morrow afternoon and I just love the thought of  going. Isn't it strange?\"    \"Very,\" Granny said, smiling. \"But you be sure to be a noice choild  this afternoon, no matter what that wan says to you.\"    Granny always referred to Laura as \"that wan.\"    \"Oh, yes, I'll be good, Granny. Isn't it funny,\" Maida went on. The  tone of her voice showed that she was thinking hard. \"Laura makes me  mad--oh, just hopping mad,\"--\"hopping mad\" was one of Rosie's  expressions--\"and yet it seems to me I'd die before I'd let her know  it.\"    Laura was waiting for her on the piazza when Maida presented herself  at the Lathrop door. \"Won't you come in and take your things off,  first?\" she said. \"I thought we'd play in the house for awhile.\"    She took Maida immediately upstairs to her bedroom--a large room all  furnished in blue--blue paper, blue bureau scarf covered with lace,  blue bed-spread covered with lace, a big, round, blue roller where  the pillows should be.    \"How do you like my room, Maida?\"    \"It's very pretty.\"    \"This is my toilet-set.\" Laura pointed to the glittering articles on  the bureau. \"Papa's given them to me, one piece at a time. It's all  of silver and every thing has my initials on it. What is your set  of?\"    Laura paused before she asked this last question and darted one of  her sideways looks at Maida. \"She thinks I haven't any toilet-set  and she wants to make me say so,\" Maida thought. \"Ivory,\" she said  aloud.    \"Ivory! I shouldn't think that would be very pretty.\"    Laura opened her bureau drawers, one at a time, and showed Maida the  pretty clothes packed in neat piles there. She opened the large  closet and displayed elaborately-made frocks, suspended on hangers.  And all the time, with little sharp, sideways glances, she was  studying the effect on Maida. But Maida's face betrayed none of the  wonder and envy that Laura evidently expected. Maida was very polite  but it was evident that she was not much interested.    Next they went upstairs to a big playroom which covered the whole  top of the house. Shelves covered with books and toys lined the  walls. A fire, burning in the big fireplace, made it very cheerful.    \"Oh, what a darling doll-house,\" Maida exclaimed, pausing before the  miniature mansion, very elegantly furnished.    \"Oh, do you like it?\" Laura beamed with pride.    \"I just love it! Particularly because it's so little.\"    \"Little!\" Laura bristled. \"I don't think it's so very little. It's  the biggest doll-house I ever saw. Did you ever see a bigger one?\"    Maida looked embarrassed. \"Only one.\"    \"Whose was it?\"    \"It was the one my father had built for me at Pride's. It was too  big to be a doll's house. It was really a small cottage. There were  four rooms--two upstairs and two downstairs and a staircase that you  could really walk up. But I don't like it half so well as this one,\"  Maida went on truthfully. \"I think it's very queer but, somehow, the  smaller things are the better I like them. I guess it's because I've  seen so many big things.\"    Laura looked impressed and puzzled at the same time. \"And you really  could walk up the stairs? Let's go up in the cupola,\" she suggested,  after an uncertain interval in which she seemed to think of nothing  else to show.    The stairs at the end of the playroom led into the cupola. Maida  exclaimed with delight over the view which she saw from the windows.  On one side was the river with the draw-bridge, the Navy Yard and  the monument on Bunker Hill. On the other stretched the smoky  expanse of Boston with the golden dome of the state house gleaming  in the midst of a huge, red-brick huddle.    \"Did you have a cupola at Pride's Crossing?\" Laura asked  triumphantly.    \"Oh, no--how I wish I had!\"    Laura beamed again.    \"Laura likes to have things other people haven't,\" Maida thought.    Her hostess now conducted her back over the two flights of stairs to  the lower floor. They went into the dining-room, which was all  shining oak and glittering cut-glass; into the parlor, which was  filled with gold furniture, puffily upholstered in blue brocade;  into the libraries, which Maida liked best of all, because there  were so many books and--    \"Oh, oh, oh!\" she exclaimed, stopping before one of the pictures;  \"that's Santa Maria in Cosmedin. I haven't seen that since I left  Rome.\"    \"How long did you stay in Rome, little girl?\" a voice asked back of  her. Maida turned. Mrs. Lathrop had come into the room.    Maida arose immediately from her chair. \"We stayed in Rome two  months,\" she said.    \"Indeed. And where else did you go?\"    \"London, Paris, Florence and Venice.\"    \"Do you know these other pictures?\" Mrs. Lathrop asked. \"I've been  collecting photographs of Italian churches.\"    Maida went about identifying the places with little cries of joy.  \"Ara Coeli--I saw in there the little wooden bambino who cures sick  people. It's so covered with bracelets and rings and lockets and  pins and chains that grateful people have given"]]]
