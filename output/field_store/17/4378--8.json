I could not prevail on Makochera to give me a specimen of poetry; he  was afraid, neither he nor his forefathers had ever seen an  Englishman. He thought that God was not good because He killed so many  people. Dr. Roscher must have travelled as an Arab if he came this  way, for he was not known.[10]    _9th June, 1866._--We now left and marched through the same sort of  forest, gradually ascending in altitude as we went west, then we came  to huge masses of granite, or syenite, with flakes peeling off. They  are covered with a plant with grassy-looking leaves and rough stalk  which strips into portions similar to what are put round candles as  ornaments. It makes these hills look light grey, with patches of  black rock at the more perpendicular parts; the same at about ten  miles off look dark blue. The ground is often hard and stony, but all  covered over with grass and plants: looking down at it, the grass is  in tufts, and like that on the Kalahari desert. Trees show uplands.  One tree of which bark cloth is made, pterocarpus, is abundant.  Timber-trees appear here and there, but for the most part the growth  is stunted, and few are higher than thirty feet. We spent the night by  a hill of the usual rounded form, called Njengo. The Rovuma comes  close by, but leaves us again to wind among similar great masses. Lat.  11 deg. 20' 05\" S.    _10th June, 1866._--A very heavy march through the same kind of  country, no human habitation appearing; we passed a dead  body--recently, it was said, starved to death. The large tract between  Makochera's and our next station at Ngozo hill is without any  perennial stream; water is found often by digging in the sand streams  which we several times crossed; sometimes it was a trickling rill, but  I suspect that at other seasons all is dry, and people are made  dependent on the Rovuma alone. The first evidence of our being near  the pleasant haunts of man was a nice little woman drawing water at a  well. I had become separated from the rest: on giving me water she  knelt down, and, as country manners require, held it up to me with  _both_ hands. I had been misled by one of the carriers, who got  confused, though the rounded mass of Ngozo was plainly visible from  the heights we crossed east of it.    An Arab party bolted on hearing of our approach: they don't trust the  English, and this conduct increases our importance among the natives.  Lat. 11 deg. 18' 10\" S.    _11th June, 1866._--Our carriers refuse to go further, because they  say that they fear being captured here on their return.    _12th June, 1866._--I paid off the carriers, and wait for a set from  this. A respectable man, called Makoloya, or Impande, visited me, and  wished to ask some questions as to where I was going, and how long I  should be away. He had heard from a man who came from Ibo, or Wibo,  about the Bible, a large book which was consulted.    [Illustration: Tattoo of Matambwe.]    _13th June, 1866._--Makoloya brought his wife and a little corn, and  says that his father told him that there is a God, but nothing more.  The marks on their foreheads and bodies are meant only to give beauty  in the dance, they seem a sort of heraldic ornament, for they can at  once tell by his tattoo to what tribe or portion of tribe a man  belongs. The tattoo or tembo of the Matambwe and Upper Makonde very  much resembles the drawings of the old Egyptians; wavy lines, such as  the ancients made to signify water, trees and gardens enclosed in  squares, seem to have been meant of old for the inhabitants who lived  on the Rovuma, and cultivated also, the son takes the tattoo of his  father, and thus it has been perpetuated, though the meaning now  appears lost. The Makoa have the half or nearly full moon, but it is,  they say, all for ornament. Some blue stuff is rubbed into the cuts (I  am told it is charcoal), and the ornament shows brightly in persons  of light complexion, who by the bye are common. The Makonde and  Matambwe file their front teeth to points; the Machinga, a Waiyan  tribe, leave two points on the sides of the front teeth, and knock out  one of the middle incisors above and below.    [Illustration: Machinga and Waiyan Teeth.]    _14th June, 1866._--I am now as much dependent on carriers as if I had  never bought a beast of burden--but this is poor stuff to fill a  journal with. We started off to Metaba to see if the chief there would  lend some men. The headman, Kitwanga, went a long way to convoy us;  then turned, saying he was going to get men for Musa next day. We  passed near the base of the rounded masses Ngozo and Mekanga, and  think, from a near inspection, that they are over 2000 feet above the  plain, possibly 3000 feet, and nearly bare, with only the peculiar  grassy plant on some parts which are not too perpendicular. The people  are said to have stores of grain on them, and on one the chief said  there is water; he knows of no stone buildings of the olden time in  the country. We passed many masses of ferruginous conglomerate, and I  noticed that most of the gneiss dips westwards. The striae seem as if  the rock had been partially molten: at times the strike is north and  south, at others east and west; when we come to what may have been its  surface, it is as if the striae had been stirred with a rod while  soft.    We slept at a point of the Rovuma, above a cataract where a reach of  comparatively still water, from 150 to 200 yards wide, allows a school  of hippopotami to live: when the river becomes fordable in many  places, as it is said to do in August and September, they must find it  difficult to exist.    _15th June, 1866._--Another three hours' march brought us from the  sleeping-place on the Rovuma to Metaba, the chief of which, Kinazombe,  is an elderly man, with a cunning and severe cast of countenance, and  a nose Assyrian in type; he has built a large reception house, in  which a number of half-caste Arabs have taken up their abode. A great  many of the people have guns, and it is astonishing to see the number  of slave-taming sticks abandoned along the road as the poor wretches  gave in, and professed to have lost all hope of escape. Many huts have  been built by the Arabs to screen themselves from the rain as they  travelled. At Kinazombe's the second crop of maize is ready, so the  hunger will not be very much felt.    _16th June, 1866._--We heard very sombre accounts of the country in  front:--four or five days to Mtarika, and then ten days through jungle  to Mataka's town: little food at Mtarika's, but plenty with Mataka,  who is near the Lake. The Rovuma trends southerly after we leave  Ngozo, and Masusa on that river is pointed out as south-west from  Metaba, so at Ngozo the river may be said to have its furthest  northing. Masusa is reported to be five days, or at least fifty miles,  from Metaba. The route now becomes south-west.    The cattle of Africa are like the Indian buffalo, only partially  tamed; they never give their milk without the presence of the calf or  its stuffed skin, the \"fulchan.\" The women adjacent to Mozambique  partake a little of the wild animal's nature, for, like most members  of the inferior races of animals, they refuse all intercourse with  their husbands when enceinte and they continue this for about three  years afterwards, or until the child is weaned, which usually happens  about the third year. I was told, on most respectable authority, that  many fine young native men marry one wife and live happily with her  till this period; nothing will then induce her to continue to cohabit  with him, and, as the separation is to continue for three years, the  man is almost compelled to take up with another wife: this was  mentioned to me as one of the great evils of society. The same  absurdity prevails on the West Coast, and there it is said that the  men acquiesce from ideas of purity.    It is curious that trade-rum should form so important an article of  import on the West Coast while it is almost unknown on the East Coast,  for the same people began the commerce in both instances. If we look  north of Cape Delgado, we might imagine that the religious convictions  of the Arabs had something to do with the matter, but the Portuguese  south of Cape Delgado have no scruples in the matter, and would sell  their grandfathers as well as the rum if they could make money by the  transaction, they have even erected distilleries to furnish a vile  spirit from the fruit of the cashew and other fruits and grain, but  the trade does not succeed. They give their slaves also rewards of  spirit, or \"maata bicho\" (\"kill the creature,\" or \"craving within\"),  and you may meet a man who, having had much intercourse with  Portuguese, may beg spirits, but the trade does not pay. The natives  will drink it if furnished gratis. The indispensable \"dash\" of rum on  the West Coast in every political transaction with independent chiefs  is, however, quite unknown. The Moslems would certainly not abstain  from trading in spirits were the trade profitable. They often asked  for brandy from me in a sly way--as medicine; and when reminded that  their religion forbade it, would say, \"Oh, but we can drink it in  secret.\"    It is something in the nature of the people quite inexplicable, that  throughout the Makonde country hernia humoralis prevails to a  frightful extent; it is believed by the natives to be the result of  beer drinking, so they cannot be considered as abstemious.    _18th June, 1866._--Finding that Musa did not come up with the goods I  left in his charge, and fearing that all was not right, we set off  with all our hands who could carry, after service yesterday morning,  and in six hours' hard tramp arrived here just in time, for a tribe of  Wanindi, or Manindi, who are either"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16679"],[0,"The History of England (#12)"],[1,"Marche and Angouleme largely increased  Count Hugh's power, and he showed perfect impartiality in pursuing his  own interests by holding a balance between his stepson and the King of  France. Against him neither Savary nor the Poitevin communes could  contend with success. The anarchy of Poitou was an irresistible  temptation to Louis VII. \"Know you,\" he wrote to the men of Limoges,  \"that John, king of England, was deprived by the unanimous judgment of  his peers of all the lands which he held of our father Philip. We have  now received in inheritance all our father's rights, and require you to  perform the service that you owe us.\" While the English government  weakly negotiated for the prolongation of the truce, and for the pope's  intervention, Louis concluded treaties with the Poitevin barons, and  made ready an army to conquer his inheritance. Foremost among his local  partisans appeared Henry's stepfather.    The French army met at Tours on June 24, 1224, and marched through  Thouars to La Rochelle, the strongest of the Poitevin towns, and the  most devoted to England. On the way Louis forced Savary de Mauleon to  yield up Niort, and to promise to defend no other place than La  Rochelle, before which city he sat down on July 15. At first Savary  resisted vigorously. The siege of Bedford, however, prevented the  despatch of effective help from England, and Savary was perhaps already  secretly won over by Louis. Be this as it may, the town surrendered on  August 3, and with it went all Aquitaine north of the Dordogne. Savary  took service with the conqueror, and was made warden of La Rochelle and  of the adjacent coasts, while Lusignan received the reward of his  treachery in a grant of the Isle of Oleron. When Louis returned to the  north, the Count of La Marche undertook the conquest of Gascony. He  soon made himself master of St. Emilion, and of the whole of Perigord.  The surrender of La Reole opened up the passage of the Garonne, and the  capture of Bazas gave the French a foothold to the south of that river.  Only the people of Bordeaux showed any spirit in resisting Hugh. But  their resistance proved sufficient, and he withdrew baffled before  their walls.    The easiness of Louis' conquests showed their instability. \"I am sure,\"  wrote one of Henry's officers, \"that you can easily recover all that you  have lost, if you send speedy succour to these regions.\" After the  capture of Bedford, Hubert undertook the recovery of Poitou and the  defence of Gascony. Henry's younger brother Richard, a youth of sixteen,  was appointed Earl of Cornwall and Count of Poitou, dubbed knight by his  brother, and put in nominal command of the expedition despatched to  Gascony in March, 1225. His experienced uncle, William Longsword, Earl  of Salisbury, and Philip of Aubigny, were sent with him as his chief  counsellors. Received with open arms by Bordeaux, he boasted on May 2  that he had conquered all Gascony, save La Reole, and had received the  allegiance of every Gascon noble, except Elie Rudel, the lord of  Bergerac. The siege of La Reole, the only serious military operation of  the campaign, occupied Richard all the summer and autumn, and it was not  until November 13 that the burgesses opened their gates. As soon as the  French had retired, the lord of Bergerac, \"after the fashion of the  Poitevins,\" renounced Louis and professed himself the liegeman of Earl  Richard. Then the worst trouble was that Savary de Mauleon's ships  commanded the Bay of Biscay, and rendered communication between Bordeaux  and England very difficult.[1] Once more the men of the Cinque Ports  came to the king's aid, and there was severe fighting at sea, involving  much plunder of merchant vessels and dislocation of trade.        [1] The names of his _familia_ taken with him are in _Patent      Rolls of Henry III._, 1216-1227, pp. 461-62.    The English sought to supplement their military successes by diplomacy.  Richard of Cornwall made an alliance with the counts of Auvergne, and  the home administration negotiated with all possible enemies of the  French King. A proposal to affiance Henry's sister, Isabella, to Henry,  King of the Romans, the infant son of Frederick II., led to no results,  for the Archbishop of Cologne, the chief upholder of the scheme in  Germany, was murdered, and the young king found a bride in Austria. Yet  the project counteracted the negotiations set on foot by Louis to  secure Frederick II. for his own side, and induced the Emperor to take  up a position of neutrality. An impostor appeared in Flanders who gave  out that he was the old Count Baldwin, sometime Latin Emperor of the  East, who had died in prison in Bulgaria twenty years before. Baldwin's  daughter, Joan, appealed to Louis for support against the false  Baldwin, whereupon Henry recognised his claims and sought his alliance.  Nothing but the capture and execution of the impostor prevented Henry  from effecting a powerful diversion in Flanders. Peter Mauclerc, Count  of Brittany, was won over by an offer of restitution to his earldom of  Richmond, and by a promise that Henry would marry his daughter Iolande.  Intrigues were entered into with the discontented Norman nobles, and  the pope was importuned to save Henry from French assaults at the same  moment that the king made a treaty of alliance with his first cousin,  the heretical Raymond VII. of Toulouse. Honorius gave his ward little  save sympathy and good advice. His special wish was to induce Louis to  lead a French expedition into Languedoc against the Albigensian  heretics. As soon as Louis resolved on this, the pope sought to prevent  Henry from entering into unholy alliance with Raymond. It was the  crusade of 1226, not the good-will of the Pope or the fine-drawn  English negotiations, which gave Gascony a short respite. Louis VIII.  died on November 8 in the course of his expedition, and the Capetian  monarchy became less dangerous during the troubles of a minority, in  which his widow, Blanche, strove as regent to uphold the throne of  their little son, Louis IX.    The first months of Louis IX.'s reign showed how unstable was any  edifice built upon the support of the treacherous lords of Poitou.  Within six weeks of Louis VIII.'s death, Hugh of Lusignan, the viscount  of Thouars, Savary de Mauleon, and many other Poitevin barons,  concluded treaties with Richard of Cornwall, by which in return for  lavish concessions they went back to the English obedience. In the  spring of 1227, however, the appearance of a French army south of the  Loire caused these same lords to make fresh treaties with Blanche.  Peter of Brittany also became friendly with the French regent, and gave  up his daughter's English marriage. With allies so shifty, further  dealings seemed hopeless. Before Easter, Richard patched up a truce and  went home in disgust. The Capetians lost Poitou, but Henry failed to  take advantage of his rival's weakness, and the real masters of the  situation were the local barons. Fifteen more years were to elapse  before the definitive French conquest of Poitou.    During the next three years the good understanding between the Bretons,  the Poitevins, and the regent Blanche came to an end, and the progress  of the feudal reaction against the rule of the young King of France  once more excited hopes of improving Henry's position in south-western  France. Henry III. was eager to win back his inheritance, though Hubert  de Burgh had little faith in Poitevin promises, and, conscious of his  king's weakness, managed to prolong the truce, until July 22, 1229.  Three months before that, Blanche succeeded in forcing the unfortunate  Raymond VII. to accept the humiliating treaty of Meaux, which assured  the succession to his dominions to her second son Alfonse, who was to  marry his daughter and heiress, Joan. The barons of the north and west  were not yet defeated, and once more appealed to Henry to come to their  aid. Accordingly, the English king summoned his vassals to Portsmouth  on October 15 for a French campaign. When Henry went down to Portsmouth  he found that there were not enough ships to convey his troops over  sea. Thereupon he passionately denounced the justiciar as an \"old  traitor,\" and accused him of being bribed by the French queen. Nothing  but the intervention of Randolph of Chester, Hubert's persistent enemy,  put an end to the undignified scene.    Count Peter of Brittany, who arrived at Portsmouth on the 9th, did  homage to Henry as King of France, and received the earldom of Richmond  and the title of Duke of Brittany which he had long coveted, but which  the French government refused to recognise. He persuaded Henry to  postpone the expedition until the following spring. When that time came  Henry appointed Ralph Neville, the chancellor, and Stephen Segrave, a  rising judge, as wardens of England, and on May 1, 1230, set sail from  Portsmouth. It was the first time since 1213 that an English king had  crossed the seas at the head of an army, and every effort was made to  equip a sufficient force. Hubert the justiciar, Randolph of Chester,  William the marshal, and most of the great barons personally shared in  the expedition, and the ports of the Channel, the North Sea, and the  Bay of Biscay were ransacked to provide adequate shipping. Many Norman  vessels served as transports, apparently of their owners' free-will.    On May 3 Henry landed at St. Malo, and thence proceeded to Dinan, the  meeting-place assigned for his army, the greater part of which landed at  Port Blanc, a little north of Treguier. Peter Mauclerc joined him, and a  plan of operations was discussed. The moment was favourable, for a great  number of the French magnates were engaged in war against Theobald, the  poet-count of Champagne, and the French army, which was assembled at  Angers, represented but a fraction of the military strength of the land.
