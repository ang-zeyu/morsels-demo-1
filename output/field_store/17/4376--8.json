I learn the wisdom of  St. Bernard,[141]--\"Nothing can, work me damage except myself; the  harm, that I sustain I carry about with me, and never am a real  sufferer but by my own fault.\"    In the nature of the soul is the compensation for the inequalities of  condition. The radical tragedy of nature seems to be the distinction  of More and Less. How can Less not feel the pain; how not feel  indignation or malevolence towards More? Look at those who have less  faculty, and one feels sad, and knows not well what to make of it. He  almost shuns their eye; he fears they will upbraid God. What should  they do? It seems a great injustice. But see the facts nearly, and  these mountainous inequalities vanish. Love reduces them, as the sun  melts the iceberg in the sea. The heart and soul of all men being one,  this bitterness of _His_ and _Mine_ ceases. His is mine. I am my  brother, and my brother is me. If I feel overshadowed and outdone by  great neighbors, I can yet love; I can still receive; and he that  loveth maketh his own the grandeur he loves. Thereby I make the  discovery that my brother is my guardian, acting for me with the  friendliest designs, and the estate I so admired and envied is my own.  It is the nature of the soul to appropriate all things. Jesus[142] and  Shakespeare are fragments of the soul, and by love I conquer and  incorporate them in my own conscious domain. His[143] virtue,--is not  that mine? His wit,--if it cannot be made mine, it is not wit.    Such, also, is the natural history of calamity. The changes which  break up at short intervals the prosperity of men are advertisements  of a nature whose law is growth. Every soul is by this intrinsic  necessity quitting its whole system of things, its friends, and home,  and laws, and faith, as the shellfish crawls out of its beautiful but  stony case, because it no longer admits of its growth, and slowly  forms a new house. In proportion to the vigor of the individual, these  revolutions are frequent, until in some happier mind they are  incessant, and all worldly relations hang very loosely about him,  becoming, as it were, a transparent fluid membrane through which the  living form is seen, and not, as in most men, an indurated  heterogeneous fabric of many dates, and of no settled character, in  which the man is imprisoned. Then there can be enlargement, and the  man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man of yesterday. And such  should be the outward biography of man in time, a putting off of dead  circumstances day by day, as he renews his raiment day by day. But to  us, in our lapsed estate, resting, not advancing, resisting, not  cooeperating with the divine expansion, this growth comes by shocks.    We cannot part with our friend. We cannot let our angels go. We do not  see that they only go out, that archangels may come in. We are  idolaters of the old. We do not believe in the riches of the soul, in  its proper eternity and omnipresence. We do not believe there is any  force in to-day to rival or recreate that beautiful yesterday. We  linger in the ruins of the old tent, where once we had bread and  shelter and organs, nor believe that the spirit can feed, cover, and  nerve us again. We cannot again find aught so dear, so sweet, so  graceful. But we sit and weep in vain. The voice of the Almighty  saith, \"Up and onward forevermore!\" We cannot stay amid the ruins.  Neither will we rely on the new; and so we walk ever with reverted  eyes, like those monsters who look backwards.    And yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the  understanding also, after long intervals of time. A fever, a  mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of  friends, seems at the moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the sure  years reveal the deep remedial force that underlies all facts. The  death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but  privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius;  for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an  epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up  a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows  the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character. It  permits or constrains the formation of new acquaintances, and the  reception of new influences that prove of the first importance to the  next years; and the man or woman who would have remained a sunny  garden flower, with no room for its roots and too much sunshine for  its head, by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the gardener,  is made the banyan[144] of the forest, yielding shade and fruit to  wide neighborhoods of men.          SELF-RELIANCE    \"Ne te quaesiveris extra.\"[145]        \"Man is his own star; and the soul that can      Render an honest and a perfect man,      Commands all light, all influence, all fate;      Nothing to him falls early or too late.      Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,      Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.\"[146]           *       *       *       *       *          Cast the bantling on the rocks,        Suckle him with the she-wolf's teat;        Wintered with the hawk and fox,        Power and speed be hands and feet.[147]    I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which  were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an  admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The  sentiment they instill is of more value than any thought they may  contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for  you in your private heart is true for all men,--that is genius.[148]  Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal  sense;[149] for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,--and our  first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last  Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest  merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato,[150] and Milton[151] is, that they  set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men, but what  they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of  light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the luster  of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice  his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize  our own rejected thoughts:[152] they come back to us with a certain  alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson  for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression  with good-humored inflexibility then most when[153] the whole cry of  voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with  masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the  time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from  another.    There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the  conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide;[154]  that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that  though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn  can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground  which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new  in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor  does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one  character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none.  This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony.  The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of  that particular ray. We but half express ourselves,[155] and are  ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be  safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be  faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by  cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his  work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise shall  give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the  attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no  hope.    Trust thyself:[156] every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept  the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your  contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done  so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age,  betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated  at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all  their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind  the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a  protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides,  redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing  on Chaos[157] and the Dark.    What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text, in the face and  behavior of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel  mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed  the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these[158] have not.  Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we  look in their faces we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody:  all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five[159]  out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth  and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and  made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it  will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he  cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is  sufficiently clear and emphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his  contemporaries.

Nu was  the spirit of the primordial deep, and Nut of the waters above the  heavens, the mother of moon and sun and the stars. The others were  phases of light and darkness and the forces of nature in activity and  repose.    Nu is represented in Babylonian mythology by Apsu-Rishtu, and Nut by  Mummu-Tiamat or Tiawath; the next pair is Lachmu and Lachamu, and the  third, Anshar and Kishar. The fourth pair is missing, but the names of  Anu and Ea (as Nudimmud) are mentioned in the first tablet of the  Creation series, and the name of a third is lost. Professor Budge  thinks that the Assyrian editors substituted the ancient triad of Anu,  Ea, and Enlil for the pair which would correspond to those found in  Egypt. Originally the wives of Anu and Ea may have made up the group  of eight primitive deities.    There can be little doubt but that Ea, as he survives to us, is of  later characterization than the first pair of primitive deities who  symbolized the deep. The attributes of this beneficent god reflect the  progress, and the social and moral ideals of a people well advanced in  civilization. He rewarded mankind for the services they rendered to  him; he was their leader and instructor; he achieved for them the  victories over the destructive forces of nature. In brief, he was the  dragon slayer, a distinction, by the way, which was attached in later  times to his son Merodach, the Babylonian god, although Ea was still  credited with the victory over the dragon's husband.    When Ea was one of the pre-Babylonian group--the triad of Bel-Enlil,  Anu, and Ea--he resembled the Indian Vishnu, the Preserver, while  Bel-Enlil resembled Shiva, the Destroyer, and Anu, the father, supreme  Brahma, the Creator and Father of All, the difference in exact  adjustment being due, perhaps, to Sumerian political conditions.    Ea, as we have seen, symbolized the beneficence of the waters; their  destructive force was represented by Tiamat or Tiawath, the dragon,  and Apsu, her husband, the arch-enemy of the gods. We shall find these  elder demons figuring in the Babylonian Creation myth, which receives  treatment in a later chapter.    The ancient Sumerian city of Eridu, which means \"on the seashore\", was  invested with great sanctity from the earliest times, and Ea, the  \"great magician of the gods\", was invoked by workers of spells, the  priestly magicians of historic Babylonia. Excavations have shown that  Eridu was protected by a retaining wall of sandstone, of which  material many of its houses were made. In its temple tower, built of  brick, was a marble stairway, and evidences have been forthcoming that  in the later Sumerian period the structure was lavishly adorned. It is  referred to in the fragments of early literature which have survived  as \"the splendid house, shady as the forest\", that \"none may enter\".  The mythological spell exercised by Eridu in later times suggests that  the civilization of Sumeria owed much to the worshippers of Ea. At the  sacred city the first man was created: there the souls of the dead  passed towards the great Deep. Its proximity to the sea--Ea was  Nin-bubu, \"god of the sailor\"--may have brought it into contact with  other peoples and other early civilizations. Like the early Egyptians,  the early Sumerians may have been in touch with Punt (Somaliland),  which some regard as the cradle of the Mediterranean race. The  Egyptians obtained from that sacred land incense-bearing trees which  had magical potency. In a fragmentary Babylonian charm there is a  reference to a sacred tree or bush at Eridu. Professor Sayce has  suggested that it is the Biblical \"Tree of Life\" in the Garden of  Eden. His translations of certain vital words, however, is sharply  questioned by Mr. R. Campbell Thompson of the British Museum, who does  not accept the theory.[49] It may be that Ea's sacred bush or tree is  a survival of tree and water worship.    If Eridu was not the \"cradle\" of the Sumerian race, it was possibly  the cradle of Sumerian civilization. Here, amidst the shifting rivers  in early times, the agriculturists may have learned to control and  distribute the water supply by utilizing dried-up beds of streams to  irrigate the land. Whatever successes they achieved were credited to  Ea, their instructor and patron; he was Nadimmud, \"god of everything\".          CHAPTER III.    RIVAL PANTHEONS AND REPRESENTATIVE DEITIES        Why Different Gods were Supreme at Different Centres--Theories    regarding Origin of Life--Vital Principle in Water--Creative Tears    of Weeping Deities--Significance of widespread Spitting    Customs--Divine Water in Blood and Divine Blood in Water--Liver as    the Seat of Life--Inspiration derived by Drinking Mead, Blood,    &c.--Life Principle in Breath--Babylonian Ghosts as \"Evil Wind    Gusts\"--Fire Deities--Fire and Water in Magical Ceremonies--Moon    Gods of Ur and Harran--Moon Goddess and Babylonian \"Jack and    Jill\"--Antiquity of Sun Worship--Tammuz and Ishtar--Solar Gods of    War, Pestilence, and Death--Shamash as the \"Great Judge\"--His Mitra    Name--Aryan Mitra or Mithra and linking Babylonian Deities--Varuna    and Shamash Hymns compared--The Female Origin of Life--Goddesses of    Maternity--The Babylonian Thor--Deities of Good and Evil.      In dealing with the city cults of Sumer and Akkad, consideration must  be given to the problems involved by the rival mythological systems.  Pantheons not only varied in detail, but were presided over by  different supreme gods. One city's chief deity might be regarded as a  secondary deity at another centre. Although Ea, for instance, was  given first place at Eridu, and was so pronouncedly Sumerian in  character, the moon god Nannar remained supreme at Ur, while the sun  god, whose Semitic name was Shamash, presided at Larsa and Sippar.  Other deities were similarly exalted in other states.    As has been indicated, a mythological system must have been strongly  influenced by city politics. To hold a community in sway, it was  necessary to recognize officially the various gods worshipped by  different sections, so as to secure the constant allegiance of all  classes to their rulers. Alien deities were therefore associated with  local and tribal deities, those of the nomads with those of the  agriculturists, those of the unlettered folks with those of the  learned people. Reference has been made to the introduction of strange  deities by conquerors. But these were not always imposed upon a  community by violent means. Indications are not awanting that the  worshippers of alien gods were sometimes welcomed and encouraged to  settle in certain states. When they came as military allies to assist  a city folk against a fierce enemy, they were naturally much admired  and praised, honoured by the women and the bards, and rewarded by the  rulers.    In the epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, we meet with  Ea-bani, a Goliath of the wilds, who is entreated to come to the aid  of the besieged city of Erech when it seemed that its deities were  unable to help the people against their enemies.        The gods of walled-round Erech      To flies had turned and buzzed in the streets;      The winged bulls of walled-round Erech      Were turned to mice and departed through the holes.    Ea-bani was attracted to Erech by the gift of a fair woman for wife.  The poet who lauded him no doubt mirrored public opinion. We can see  the slim, shaven Sumerians gazing with wonder and admiration on their  rough heroic ally.        All his body was covered with hair,      His locks were like a woman's,      Thick as corn grew his abundant hair.      He was a stranger to the people and in that land.      Clad in a garment like Gira, the god,      He had eaten grass with the gazelles,      He had drunk water with savage beasts.      His delight was to be among water dwellers.    Like the giant Alban, the eponymous ancestor of a people who invaded  prehistoric Britain, Ea-bani appears to have represented in Babylonian  folk legends a certain type of foreign settlers in the land. No doubt  the city dwellers, who were impressed by the prowess of the hairy and  powerful warriors, were also ready to acknowledge the greatness of  their war gods, and to admit them into the pantheon. The fusion of  beliefs which followed must have stimulated thought and been  productive of speculative ideas. \"Nowhere\", remarks Professor Jastrow,  \"does a high form of culture arise without the commingling of diverse  ethnic elements.\"    We must also take into account the influence exercised by leaders of  thought like En-we-dur-an-ki, the famous high priest of Sippar, whose  piety did much to increase the reputation of the cult of Shamesh, the  sun god. The teachings and example of Buddha, for instance,  revolutionized Brahmanic religion in India.    A mythology was an attempt to solve the riddle of the Universe, and to  adjust the relations of mankind with the various forces represented by  the deities. The priests systematized existing folk beliefs and  established an official religion. To secure the prosperity of the  State, it was considered necessary to render homage unto whom homage  was due at various seasons and under various circumstances.    The religious attitude of a particular community, therefore, must have  been largely dependent on its needs and experiences. The food supply  was a first consideration. At Eridu, as we have seen, it was assured  by devotion to Ea and obedience to his commands as an instructor.  Elsewhere it might happen, however, that Ea's gifts were restricted or  withheld by an obstructing force--the raging storm god, or the  parching, pestilence-bringing deity of the sun. It was necessary,  therefore, for the people to win the favour of the god or goddess who  seemed most powerful, and was accordingly considered to be the  greatest in"]]]
