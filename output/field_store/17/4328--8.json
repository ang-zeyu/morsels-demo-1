They had circumcision, the covenant, the  promises, the apostleship. But because of these advantages they were  not to think themselves righteous before God. None of these prerogatives  spell faith in Christ, which alone can justify a person. We do not mean  to imply that the Law is bad. We do not condemn the Law, circumcision,  etc., for their failure to justify us. Paul spoke disparagingly of these  ordinances, because the false apostles asserted that mankind is saved by  them without faith. Paul could not let this assertion stand, for without  faith all things are deadly.        VERSE 16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,    but by the faith of Jesus Christ.    For the sake of argument let us suppose that you could fulfill the Law  in the spirit of the first commandment of God: \"Thou shalt love the  Lord, thy God, with all thy heart.\" It would do you no good. A person  simply is not justified by the works of the Law.    The works of the Law, according to Paul, include the whole Law,  judicial, ceremonial, moral. Now, if the performance of the moral law  cannot justify, how can circumcision justify, when circumcision is part  of the ceremonial law?    The demands of the Law may be fulfilled before and after justification.  There were many excellent men among the pagans of old, men who never  heard of justification. They lived moral lives. But that fact did not  justify them. Peter, Paul, all Christians, live up to the Law. But that  fact does not justify them. \"For I know nothing by myself,\" says Paul,  \"yet am I not hereby justified.\" (I Cor. 4:4.)    The nefarious opinion of the papists, which attributes the merit of  grace and the remission of sins to works, must here be emphatically  rejected. The papists say that a good work performed before grace has  been obtained, is able to secure grace for a person, because it is  no more than right that God should reward a good deed. When grace has  already been obtained, any good work deserves everlasting life as a due  payment and reward for merit. For the first, God is no debtor, they say;  but because God is good and just, it is no more than right (they say)  that He should reward a good work by granting grace for the service.  But when grace has already been obtained, they continue, God is in the  position of a debtor, and is in duty bound to reward a good work with  the gift of eternal life. This is the wicked teaching of the papacy.    Now, if I could perform any work acceptable to God and deserving of  grace, and once having obtained grace my good works would continue to  earn for me the right and reward of eternal life, why should I stand in  need of the grace of God and the suffering and death of Christ? Christ  would be of no benefit to me. Christ's mercy would be of no use to me.    This shows how little insight the pope and the whole of his religious  coterie have into spiritual matters, and how little they concern  themselves with the spiritual health of their forlorn flocks. They  cannot believe that the flesh is unable to think, speak, or do anything  except against God. If they could see evil rooted in the nature of  man, they would never entertain such silly dreams about man's merit or  worthiness.    With Paul we absolutely deny the possibility of self merit. God never  yet gave to any person grace and everlasting life as a reward for merit.  The opinions of the papists are the intellectual pipe-dreams of idle  pates, that serve no other purpose but to draw men away from the true  worship of God. The papacy is founded upon hallucinations.    The true way of salvation is this. First, a person must realize that he  is a sinner, the kind of a sinner who is congenitally unable to do any  good thing. \"Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.\" Those who seek to  earn the grace of God by their own efforts are trying to please God with  sins. They mock God, and provoke His anger. The first step on the way to  salvation is to repent.    The second part is this. God sent His only-begotten Son into the world  that we may live through His merit. He was crucified and killed for us.  By sacrificing His Son for us God revealed Himself to us as a  merciful Father who donates remission of sins, righteousness, and life  everlasting for Christ's sake. God hands out His gifts freely unto all  men. That is the praise and glory of His mercy.    The scholastics explain the way of salvation in this manner. When a  person happens to perform a good deed, God accepts it and as a reward  for the good deed God pours charity into that person. They call it  \"charity infused.\" This charity is supposed to remain in the heart.  They get wild when they are told that this quality of the heart cannot  justify a person.    They also claim that we are able to love God by our own natural  strength, to love God above all things, at least to the extent that we  deserve grace. And, say the scholastics, because God is not satisfied  with a literal performance of the Law, but expects us to fulfill the  Law according to the mind of the Lawgiver, therefore we must obtain  from above a quality above nature, a quality which they call \"formal  righteousness.\"    We say, faith apprehends Jesus Christ. Christian faith is not an  inactive quality in the heart. If it is true faith it will surely take  Christ for its object. Christ, apprehended by faith and dwelling in the  heart, constitutes Christian righteousness, for which God gives eternal  life.    In contrast to the doting dreams of the scholastics, we teach this:  First a person must learn to know himself from the Law. With the prophet  he will then confess: \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of  God.\" And, \"there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\" And, \"against  thee, thee only, have I sinned.\"    Having been humbled by the Law, and having been brought to a right  estimate of himself, a man will repent. He finds out that he is so  depraved, that no strength, no works, no merits of his own will ever  deliver him from his guilt. He will then understand the meaning of  Paul's words: \"I am sold under sin\"; and \"they are all under sin.\"    At this state a person begins to lament: \"Who is going to help me?\"  In due time comes the Word of the Gospel, and says: \"Son, thy sins are  forgiven thee. Believe in Jesus Christ who was crucified for your sins.  Remember, your sins have been imposed upon Christ.\"    In this way are we delivered from sin. In this way are we justified and  made heirs of everlasting life.    In order to have faith you must paint a true portrait of Christ. The  scholastics caricature Christ into a judge and tormentor. But Christ is  no law giver. He is the Lifegiver. He is the Forgiver of sins. You must  believe that Christ might have atoned for the sins of the world with one  single drop of His blood. Instead, He shed His blood abundantly in order  that He might give abundant satisfaction for our sins.    Here let me say, that these three things, faith, Christ, and imputation  of righteousness, are to be joined together. Faith takes hold of Christ.  God accounts this faith for righteousness.    This imputation of righteousness we need very much, because we are far  from perfect. As long as we have this body, sin will dwell in our flesh.  Then, too, we sometimes drive away the Holy Spirit; we fall into sin,  like Peter, David, and other holy men. Nevertheless we may always take  recourse to this fact, \"that our sins are covered,\" and that \"God will  not lay them to our charge.\" Sin is not held against us for Christ's  sake. Where Christ and faith are lacking, there is no remission or  covering of sins, but only condemnation.    After we have taught faith in Christ, we teach good works. \"Since you  have found Christ by faith,\" we say, \"begin now to work and do well.  Love God and your neighbor. Call upon God, give thanks unto Him, praise  Him, confess Him. These are good works. Let them flow from a cheerful  heart, because you have remission of sin in Christ.\"    When crosses and afflictions come our way, we bear them patiently.  \"For Christ's yoke is easy, and His burden is light.\" When sin has been  pardoned, and the conscience has been eased of its dreadful load, a  Christian can endure all things in Christ.    To give a short definition of a Christian: A Christian is not somebody  who chalks(sp) sin, because of his faith in Christ. This doctrine brings  comfort to consciences in serious trouble. When a person is a Christian  he is above law and sin. When the Law accuses him, and sin wants to  drive the wits out of him, a Christian looks to Christ. A Christian is  free. He has no master except Christ. A Christian is greater than the  whole world.        VERSE 16. Even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be    justified.    The true way of becoming a Christian is to be justified by faith in  Jesus Christ, and not by the works of the Law.    We know that we must also teach good works, but they must be taught in  their proper turn, when the discussion is concerning works and not the  article of justification.    Here the question arises by what means are we justified? We answer with  Paul, \"By faith only in Christ are we pronounced righteous, and not  by works.\" Not that we reject good works. Far from it. But we will not  allow ourselves to be removed from the anchorage of our salvation.    The Law is a good thing. But when the discussion is about justification,  then is no time to drag in the Law. When we discuss justification we  ought to speak of Christ and the benefits He has brought us.    Christ is no sheriff. He is \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin  of the world.\" (John 1:29.)        VERSE 16. That we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by    the works of the Law.

SEVCIK AND AUER: A CONTRAST IN TEACHING    Knowing that in the regimental band he was, quite appropriately, a  clarinetist, \"the clarinet in the military band being the equivalent of  the violin in the orchestra\"--and a scholarship pupil of the Vienna  _Meisterschule_, it seemed natural to ask him concerning his teachers.  And the interesting fact developed that he had studied with the  celebrated Bohemian pedagog Sevcik and with Leopold Auer as well, two  teachers whose ideas and methods differ materially. \"I studied with  Sevcik for two years,\" said the young violinist. \"It was in 1909, when a  class of ten pupils was formed for him in the _Meisterschule_, at  Vienna, that I went to him. Sevcik was in many ways a wonderful teacher,  yet inclined to overemphasize the mechanical side of the art. He  literally _taught_ his pupils how to practice, how to develop technical  control by the most slow and painstaking study. In addition to his own  fine method and exercises, he also used Gavinies, Dont, Rode, Kreutzer,  applying in their studies ideas of his own.    \"Auer as a teacher I found altogether different. Where Sevcik taught his  pupils the technic of their art by means of a system elaborately worked  out, Auer demonstrated his ideas through sheer personality, mainly from  the interpretative point of view. Any ambitious student could learn much  of value from either; yet in a general way one might express the  difference between them by saying that Sevcik could take a pupil of  medium talent and--at least from the mechanical standpoint--make an  excellent violinist of him. But Auer is an ideal teacher for the greatly  gifted. And he is especially skilled in taking some student of the  violin while his mind is still plastic and susceptible and molding  it--supplying it with lofty concepts of interpretation and expression.  Of course Auer (I studied with him in Petrograd and Dresden) has been  especially fortunate as regards his pupils, too, because active in a  land like Russia, where musical genius has almost become a commonplace.    \"Sevcik, though an admirable teacher, personally is of a reserved and  reflective type, quite different from Auer, who is open and expansive. I  might recall a little instance which shows Sevcik's cautious nature, the  care he takes not to commit himself too unreservedly. When I took leave  of him--it was after I had graduated and won my prize--I naturally (like  all his pupils) asked him for his photo. Several other pupils of his  were in the room at the time. He took up his pen (I was looking over  his shoulder), commenced to write _Meinem best_.... And then he stopped,  glanced at the other pupils in the room, and wrote over the _best_ ...  he had already written, the word _liebsten_. But though I would, of  course, have preferred the first inscription, had Sevcik completed it, I  can still console myself that the other, even though I value it, was an  afterthought. But it was a characteristic thing for him to do!                         THE VIOLIN AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSION    \"What is my idea of the violin as a medium of expression? It seems to me  that it is that of any other valid artistic medium. It is not so much a  question of the violin as of the violinist. A great interpreter reveals  his inner-most soul through his instrument, whatever it may be. Most  people think the violin is more expressive than any other instrument,  but this is open to question. It may be that most people respond more  readily to the appeal made by the violin. But genuine expression,  expressive playing, depends on the message the player has to deliver far  more than on the instrument he uses as a means. I have been as much  moved by some piano playing I have heard as by the violin playing of  some of the greatest violinists.    \"And variety, _nuance_ in expressive playing, is largely a matter of the  player's mental attitude. Bach's _Chaconne_ or _Sicilienne_ calls for a  certain humility on the part of the artist. When I play Bach I do it  reverentially; a definite spiritual quality in my tone and expression is  the result. And to select a composer who in many ways is Bach's exact  opposite, Wieniawski, a certain audacious brilliancy cannot help but  make itself felt tonally, if this music is to be played in character.  The mental and spiritual attitude directly influences its own mechanical  transmission. No one artist should criticize another for differences in  interpretation, in expression, so long as they are justified by larger  concepts of art. Individuality is one of the artist's most precious  possessions, and there are always a number of different angles from  which the interpretation of an art work may be approached.                                  VIOLIN MASTERY    \"Violin mastery? There have been only three violinists within my own  recollection, whom I would call masters of the violin. These are  Kubelik (when at his best), Franz von Vecsey, Hubay's pupil, whom I  heard abroad, and Heifetz, with his cameo-like perfection of technic.  These I would call masters of the violin, as an instrument, since they  have mastered every intricacy of the instrument. But I could name  several others who are greater musicians, and whose playing and  interpretation, to say nothing of tone, I prefer.                             TONE PRODUCTION: RHYTHM    \"In one sense true violin mastery is a question of tone production and  rhythm. And I believe that tone production depends principally upon the  imaginative ear of the player. This statement may seem somewhat  ambiguous, and one might ask, 'What is an imaginative ear?' My ear, for  instance, demands of my violin a certain quality of tone, which varies  according to the music I am playing. But before I think of playing the  music, I already know from reading it what I want it to sound like: that  is to say, the quality of the tone I wish to secure in each principal  phrase. Rhythm is perhaps the greatest factor in interpretation. Every  good musician has a 'good sense of rhythm' (that much abused phrase).  But it is only the _great_ musician who makes so striking and  individual an application of rhythm that his playing may be easily  distinguished by his use of it.    \"There is not much to tell you as regards my method of work. I usually  work directly upon a program which has been previously mapped out. If I  have been away from my violin for more than a week or two I begin by  practicing scales, but ordinarily I find my technical work in the  programs I am preparing.\"    Asked about his band experiences at Camp Upton, Sergeant Hochstein was  enthusiastic. \"No violinist could help but gain much from work with a  military band at one of the camps,\" he said. \"For instance, I had a more  or less theoretical knowledge of wind instruments before I went to Camp  Upton. Now I have a practical working knowledge of them. I have already  scored a little violin composition of mine, a 'Minuet in Olden Style'  for full band, and have found it possible by the right manipulation to  preserve its original dainty and graceful character, in spite of the  fact that it is played by more than forty military bandsmen.    \"Then, too,\" he said in conclusion, \"I have organized a real orchestra  of twenty-one players, strings, brass, wood-wind, etc., which I hope is  going to be of real use on the other side during our training period in  France. You see, 'over there' the soldier boys' chances for leave are  limited and we will have to depend a good deal on our own selves for  amusement and recreation. I hope and believe my orchestra is not only  going to take its place as one of the most enjoyable features of our  army life; but also that it will make propaganda of the right sort for  the best music in a broad, catholic sense of the word!\"    It is interesting to know that this patriotic young officer found  opportunities in camp and in the towns of France of carrying out his  wish to \"make propaganda of the right sort for the best music\" before he  gave his life to further the greater purpose which had called him  overseas.                                             IX                                   FRITZ KREISLER                               PERSONALITY IN ART      The influence of the artist's personality in his art finds a most  striking exemplification in the case of Fritz Kreisler. Some time before  the writer called on the famous violinist to get at first hand some of  his opinions with regard to his art, he had already met him under  particularly interesting circumstances. The question had come up of  writing text-poems for two song-adaptations of Viennese folk-themes,  airs not unattractive in themselves; but which Kreisler's personal  touch, his individual gift of harmonization had lifted from a lower  plane to the level of the art song. Together with the mss. of his own  beautiful transcript, Mr. Kreisler in the one instance had given me the  printed original which suggested it--frankly a \"popular\" song, clumsily  harmonized in a \"four-square\" manner (though written in 3/4 time) with  nothing to indicate its latent possibilities. I compared it with his  mss. and, lo, it had been transformed! Gone was the clumsiness, the  vulgar and obvious harmonic treatment of the melody--Kreisler had kept  the melodic outline, but etherealized, spiritualized it, given it new  rhythmic _contours_, a deeper and more expressive meaning. And his rich  and subtle harmonization had lent it a quality of distinction that  justified a"]]]
