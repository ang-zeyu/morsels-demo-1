It may amuse the reader to see his mother language  transformed into so odd a shape that it is with difficulty he can  recognise it.    Old Bartoline thus speaks:--\"I wrong'd _my shelf, cho entcher incho  bondsh_ of marriage and could not perform _covenantsh_ I might well  _hinke_ you would _chake_ the forfeiture of the bond; and I never found  _equichy_ in a _bedg_ in my life; but I'll trounce you _boh_; I have  paved _jaylsh_ wi' the _bonesh_ of honester people _yen_ you are, _yat_  never did me nor any man any wrong, but had law of _yeir shydsh_ and  right o' _yeir shydsh_, but because _yey_ had not me o' _yeir shydsh_. I  ha' _hrown_ 'em in _jaylsh_, and got _yeir eshchatsch_ for my _clyentsh  yat_ had no more _chytle_ to 'em _yen dogsh_.\"          THE COMEDY OF A MADMAN.      Desmarets, the friend of Richelieu, was a very extraordinary character,  and produced many effusions of genius in early life, till he became a  mystical fanatic. It was said of him that \"he was the greatest madman  among poets, and the best poet among madmen.\" His comedy of \"The  Visionaries\" is one of the most extraordinary dramatic projects, and, in  respect to its genius and its lunacy, may be considered as a literary  curiosity.    In this singular comedy all Bedlam seems to be let loose on the stage,  and every character has a high claim to an apartment in it. It is indeed  suspected that the cardinal had a hand in this anomalous drama, and in  spite of its extravagance it was favourably received by the public, who  certainly had never seen anything like it.    Every character in this piece acts under some hallucination of the mind,  or a fit of madness. Artabaze is a cowardly hero, who believes he has  conquered the world. Amidor is a wild poet, who imagines he ranks above  Homer. Filidan is a lover, who becomes inflammable as gunpowder for  every mistress he reads of in romances. Phalante is a beggarly bankrupt,  who thinks himself as rich as Croesus. Melisse, in reading the \"History  of Alexander,\" has become madly in love with this hero, and will have no  other husband than \"him of Macedon.\" Hesperie imagines her fatal charms  occasion a hundred disappointments in the world, but prides herself on  her perfect insensibility. Sestiane, who knows no other happiness than  comedies, and whatever she sees or hears, immediately plans a scene for  dramatic effect, renounces any other occupation; and finally, Alcidon,  the father of these three mad girls, as imbecile as his daughters are  wild. So much for the amiable characters!    The plot is in perfect harmony with the genius of the author, and the  characters he has invented--perfectly unconnected, and fancifully wild.  Alcidon resolves to marry his three daughters, who, however, have no  such project of their own. He offers them to the first who comes. He  accepts for his son-in-law the first who offers, and is clearly  convinced that he is within a very short period of accomplishing his  wishes. As the four ridiculous personages whom we have noticed  frequently haunt his house, he becomes embarrassed in finding one lover  too many, having only three daughters.    The catastrophe relieves the old gentleman from his embarrassments.  Melisse, faithful to her Macedonian hero, declares her resolution of  dying before she marries any meaner personage. Hesperie refuses to  marry, out of pity for mankind; for to make one man happy she thinks she  must plunge a hundred into despair. Sestiane, only passionate for  comedy, cannot consent to any marriage, and tells her father, in very  lively verses,        Je ne veux point, mon pere, espouser un censeur;      Puisque vous me souffrez recevoir la douceur      Des plaisirs innocens que le theatre apporte,      Prendrais-je le hasard de vivre d'autre sorte?      Puis on a des enfans, qui vous sont sur les bras,      Les mener an theatre, O Dieux! quel embarras!      Tantot couche ou grossesse, on quelque maladie;      Pour jamais vous font dire, adieu la comedie!        IMITATED.        No, no, my father, I will have no critic,      (Miscalled a husband) since you still permit      The innocent sweet pleasures of the stage;      And shall I venture to exchange my lot?      Then we have children folded in our arms      To bring them to the play-house; heavens! what troubles!      Then we lie in, are big, or sick, or vexed:      These make us bid farewell to comedy!    At length these imagined sons-in-law appear; Filidan declares that in  these three girls he cannot find the mistress he adores. Amidor  confesses he only asked for one of his daughters out of pure gallantry,  and that he is only a lover--in verse! When Phalante is questioned after  the great fortunes he hinted at, the father discovers that he has not a  stiver, and out of credit to borrow: while Artabaze declares that he  only allowed Alcidon, out of mere benevolence, to flatter himself for a  moment with the hope of an honour that even Jupiter would not dare to  pretend to. The four lovers disperse and leave the old gentleman more  embarrassed than ever, and his daughters perfectly enchanted to enjoy  their whimsical reveries, and die old maids--all alike \"Visionaries!\"          SOLITUDE.      We possess, among our own native treasures, two treatises on this  subject, composed with no ordinary talent, and not their least value  consists in one being an apology for solitude, while the other combats  that prevailing passion of the studious. Zimmerman's popular work is  overloaded with commonplace; the garrulity of eloquence. The two  treatises now noticed may be compared to the highly-finished gems, whose  figure may be more finely designed, and whose strokes may be more  delicate in the smaller space they occupy than the ponderous block of  marble hewed out by the German chiseller.    Sir George Mackenzie, a polite writer, and a most eloquent pleader,  published, in 1665, a moral essay, preferring Solitude to public  employment. The eloquence of his style was well suited to the dignity of  his subject; the advocates for solitude have always prevailed over those  for active life, because there is something sublime in those feelings  which would retire from the circle of indolent triflers, or depraved  geniuses. The tract of Mackenzie was ingeniously answered by the elegant  taste of John Evelyn in 1667. Mackenzie, though he wrote in favour of  solitude, passed a very active life, first as a pleader, and afterwards  as a judge; that he was an eloquent writer, and an eloquent critic, we  have the authority of Dryden, who says, that till he was acquainted with  that noble wit of Scotland, Sir George Mackenzie, he had not known the  beautiful turn of words and thoughts in poetry, which Sir George had  explained and exemplified to him in conversation. As a judge, and king's  advocate, will not the barbarous customs of the age defend his name? He  is most hideously painted forth by the dark pencil of a poetical  Spagnoletti (Grahame), in his poem on \"The Birds of Scotland.\" Sir  George lived in the age of rebellion, and used torture: we must entirely  put aside his political, to attend to his literary character. Blair has  quoted his pleadings as a model of eloquence, and Grahame is unjust to  the fame of Mackenzie, when he alludes to his \"half-forgotten name.\" In  1689, he retired to Oxford, to indulge the luxuries of study in the  Bodleian Library, and to practise that solitude which so delighted him  in theory; but three years afterwards he fixed himself in London.  Evelyn, who wrote in favour of public employment being preferable to  solitude, passed his days in the tranquillity of his studies, and wrote  against the habits which he himself most loved. By this it may appear,  that that of which we have the least experience ourselves, will ever be  what appears most delightful! Alas! everything in life seems to have in  it the nature of a bubble of air, and, when touched, we find nothing but  emptiness in our hand. It is certain that the most eloquent writers in  favour of solitude have left behind them too many memorials of their  unhappy feelings, when they indulged this passion to excess; and some  ancient has justly said, that none but a god, or a savage, can suffer  this exile from human nature.    The following extracts from Sir George Mackenzie's tract on Solitude are  eloquent and impressive, and merit to be rescued from that oblivion  which surrounds many writers, whose genius has not been effaced, but  concealed, by the transient crowd of their posterity:--         I have admired to see persons of virtue and humour long much to       be in the city, where, when they come they found nor sought for       no other divertissement than to visit one another; and there to       do nothing else than to make legs, view others habit, talk of       the weather, or some such pitiful subject, and it may be, if       they made a farther inroad upon any other affair, they did so       pick one another, that it afforded them matter of eternal       quarrel; for what was at first but an indifferent subject, is       by interest adopted into the number of our quarrels.--What       pleasure can be received by talking of new fashions, buying and       selling of lands, advancement or ruin of favourites, victories       or defeats of strange princes, which is the ordinary subject of       ordinary conversation?--Most desire to frequent their       superiors, and these men must either suffer their raillery, or       must not be suffered to continue in their society; if we       converse with them who speak with more address than ourselves,       then we repine equally at our own dulness, and envy the       acuteness that accomplishes the speaker; or, if we converse       with duller animals than ourselves, then we are weary to draw       the yoke alone, and fret at our being in ill company; but if       chance blows us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#12)"],[1,"whose principal instruments were drums and brass trumpets,  not only held such sacrifices, but, strange to say, held  them in honour of a kind of god of music, Tezcatlipoca. This  festival was the most important in Mexico, and took place  at the temple or \"teocalli,\" a gigantic, pyramid-like mass  of stone, rising in terraces to a height of eighty-six feet  above the city, and culminating in a small summit platform  upon which the long procession of priests and victims could  be seen from all parts of the city. Once a year the sacrifice  was given additional importance, for then the most beautiful  youth in Mexico was chosen to represent the god himself. For  a year before the sacrifice he was dressed as Tezcatlipoca,  in royal robes and white linen, with a helmet-like crown of  sea shells with white cocks' plumes, and with an anklet hung  with twenty gold bells as a symbol of his power, and he was  married to the most beautiful maiden in Mexico. The priests  taught him to play the flute, and whenever the people heard  the sound of it they fell down and worshipped him.    The account may be found in Bancroft's great work on the  \"Native Races of the Pacific,\" also Sahagun's \"Nueva Espana  and Bernal Diaz,\" but perhaps the most dramatic description  is that by Rowbotham:        And when the morning of the day of sacrifice arrived,      he was taken by water to the Pyramid Temple where he      was to be sacrificed, and crowds lined the banks of the      river to see him in the barge, sitting in the midst of      his beautiful companions. When the barge touched the      shore, he was taken away from those companions of his      forever, and was delivered over to a band of priests,      exchanging the company of beautiful women for men      clothed in black mantles, with long hair matted with      blood--their ears also were mangled. These conducted      him to the steps of the pyramid, and he was driven      up amidst a crowd of priests, with drums beating and      trumpets blowing. As he went up he broke an earthen      flute on every step to show that his love, and his      delights were over. And when he reached the top, he was      sacrificed on an altar of jasper, and the signal that      the sacrifice was completed was given to the multitudes      below by the rolling of the great sacrificial drum.[04]      [02] _Kong_. His disciples called him _Fu Tsee_, or \"the       master\"; Jesuit missionaries Latinized this to Confucius.    [03] The Chinese theatre has been called an unconscious       parody of our old-fashioned Italian opera, and there       are certainly many resemblances. In a Chinese play,       when the situation becomes tragic, or when one of the       characters is seized with some strong emotion, it finds       vent in a kind of aria. The dialogue is generally given       in the most monotonous manner possible--using only       high throat and head tones, occasionally lowering or       raising the voice on a word, to express emotion. This       monotonous, and to European ears, strangely nonchalant,       nasal recitative, is being continually interrupted by       gong pounding and the shrill, high sound of discordant       reed instruments. When one or more of the characters       commits suicide (which as we know is an honoured custom       in China) he sings--or rather whines--a long chant before       he dies, just as his western operatic colleagues do, as,       for instance, Edgar in \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" and even,       to come nearer home, Siegfried in \"Goetterdaemmerung.\"    [04] This drum was made of serpents' skins, and the sound of       it was so loud that it could be heard eight miles away.          VI    THE MUSIC OF GREECE      The first name of significance in Greek music is that of  Homer. The hexameters of \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\" were  quite probably chanted, but the four-stringed lyre which we  associate with the ancient Greek singers was only used for  a few preluding notes--possibly to pitch the voice of the  bard--and not during the chant itself. For whatever melody  this chant possessed, it depended entirely upon the raising  and lowering of the voice according to the accent of the words  and the dramatic feeling of the narrative. For its rhythm  it depended upon that of the hexameter, which consists of  a line of six dactyls and spondees, the line always ending  with a spondee. Really the line should end with a dactyl  ([- ' ']) and a spondee ([- -]). If a line ends with two  spondees it is a spondaic hexameter.    From this it would seem that while the pitch of the chant would  be very difficult to gauge, owing to the diversity of opinion as  to how to measure in actual sounds the effect of emotions upon  the human voice, at least the _rhythm_ of the chants would be  well defined, owing to the hexameter in which the latter were  written. Here again, however, we are cast adrift by theory,  for in practice nothing could be more misleading than such a  deduction. For instance, the following lines from Longfellow's  \"Evangeline\" are both in this metre, although the rhythm of  one differs greatly from that of the other.        Wearing her Norman cap, and her kirtle of blue, and the earrings    and        Shielding the house from storms, on the north were the barns            and the farm-yard.    Now if we think that these lines can be sung to the same  musical rhythm we are very far from the truth, although both  are hexameters, namely,        [- ' ' - ' - ' ' - ' ' - ' ' - -]        [- ' ' - ' - ' ' - ' ' - ' ' - -]    dactyls, ending with spondee.    Thus we see that metre in verse and rhythm in music are two  different things, although of course they both had the same  origin.    After all has been said, it is perhaps best to admit that, so  far as Greek music is concerned, its better part certainly lay  in poetry. In ancient times all poetry was sung or chanted; it  was what I have called impassioned speech. The declamation of  \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\" constituted what was really the  \"vocal\" music of the poems. With the Greeks the word \"music\"  (_mousike_) included all the aesthetic culture that formed part  of the education of youth; in the same general way a poet was  called a singer, and even in Roman times we find Terence, in  his \"Phormio,\" alluding to poets as musicians. That Aeschylus  and Sophocles were not musicians, as we understand the term,  is very evident in spite of the controversies on the subject.    Impassioned speech, then, was all that existed of vocal music,  and as such was in every way merely the audible expression of  poetry. I have no doubt that this is the explanation of the  statement that Aeschylus and Sophocles wrote what has been  termed the _music_ to their tragedies. What they really did  was to teach the chorus the proper declamation and stage  action. It is well known that at the Dionysian Festival  it was to the poet as \"chorus master\" that the prize was  awarded, so entirely were the arts identified one with the  other. That declamation may often reach the power of music,  it is hardly necessary to say. Among modern poets, let any  one, for instance, look at Tennyson's \"Passing of Arthur\" for  an example of this kind of music; the mere sound of the words  completes the picture. For instance, when Arthur is dying and  gives his sword, Excalibur, to Sir Bedivere with the command  to throw it into the mere, the latter twice fails to do so,  and returns to Arthur telling him that all he saw was       \"The water lapping on the crag      And the long ripple washing in the reeds.\"    But when at last he throws it, the magic sword       \"Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon      And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch      Shot like a streamer of the northern morn.      So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur.\"    Again, when Sir Bedivere, carrying the dying king, stumbles  up over the icy rocks to the shore, his armour clashing  and clanking, the verse uses all the clangour of cr--ck, the  slipping s's too, and the vowel _a_ is used in all its changes;  when the shore is finally reached, the verse suddenly turns  into smoothness, the long _o_'s giving the same feeling of  breadth and calm that modern music would attempt if it treated  the same subject.    Here are the lines:        Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves      And barren chasms, and all to left and right      The bare, black cliff clang'd round him as he based      His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang      Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels.      And on a sudden, lo! the level lake      And the long glories of the winter moon.    When we think of the earlier Greek plays, we must imagine  the music of the words themselves, the cadenced voices of  the protagonist or solitary performer, and the chorus, the  latter keeping up a rhythmic motion with the words. This,  I am convinced, was the extent of Greek music, so far as that  which was ascribed to the older poets is concerned.    Instrumental music was another thing, and although we possess  no authentic examples of it, we know what its scales consisted  of and what instruments were in use. It would be interesting  to pass in review the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles,  the odes of Sappho and Pindar, those of the latter having a  novel periodicity of form which gives force to the suggestion  that these choric dances were the forerunners of our modern  instrumental forms.    Such matters, however, take us from our actual subject, and we  will therefore turn to Pythagoras, at Crotona, in Italy (about  500 B.C.), whom we find already laying down the rules forming  a mathematical and scientific basis for the Greek musical scale.    More than three centuries had passed since Homer had chanted  his \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey,\" and in the course of the succeeding  fifty years some of the master spirits of the world were to  appear. When we think of Pythagoras, Gautama, Buddha,"]]]
