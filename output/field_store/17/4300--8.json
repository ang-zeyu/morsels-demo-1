And against thy will thou wilt have to give  account and reckoning of thyself before the Holy One, blessed be  He.\"[20]      THE IDEAL MAN    Like all creatures formed on the six days of creation, Adam came  from the hands of the Creator fully and completely developed. He  was not like a child, but like a man of twenty years of age.[21]  The dimensions of his body were gigantic, reaching from heaven to  earth, or, what amounts to the same, from east to west.[22] Among  later generations of men, there were but few who in a measure  resembled Adam in his extraordinary size and physical  perfections. Samson possessed his strength, Saul his neck,  Absalom his hair, Asahel his fleetness of foot, Uzziah his  forehead, Josiah his nostrils, Zedekiah his eyes, and Zerubbabel  his voice. History shows that these physical excellencies were no  blessings to many of their possessors; they invited the ruin of  almost all. Samson's extraordinary strength caused his death;  Saul killed himself by cutting his neck with his own sword; while  speeding swiftly, Asahel was pierced by Abner's spear; Absalom  was caught up by his hair in an oak, and thus suspended met his  death; Uzziah was smitten with leprosy upon his forehead; the  darts that killed Josiah entered through his nostrils, and  Zedekiah's eyes were blinded.[23]    The generality of men inherited as little of the beauty as of the  portentous size of their first father. The fairest women compared  with Sarah are as apes compared with a human being. Sarah's  relation to Eve is the same, and, again, Eve was but as an ape  compared with Adam. His person was so handsome that the very sole  of his foot obscured the splendor of the sun.[24]    His spiritual qualities kept pace with his personal charm, for  God had fashioned his soul with particular care. She is the image  of God, and as God fills the world, so the soul fills the human  body; as God sees all things, and is seen by none, so the soul  sees, but cannot be seen; as God guides the world, so the soul  guides the body; as God in His holiness is pure, so is the soul;  and as God dwells in secret, so doth the soul.[25]    When God was about to put a soul into Adam's clod-like body, He  said: \"At which point shall I breathe the soul into him? Into the  mouth? Nay, for he will use it to speak ill of his fellow-man.  Into the eyes? With them he will wink lustfully. Into the ears?  They will hearken to slander and blasphemy. I will breathe her  into his nostrils; as they discern the unclean and reject it, and  take in the fragrant, so the pious will shun sin, and will cleave  to the words of the Torah\"[26]    The perfections of Adam's soul showed themselves as soon as he  received her, indeed, while he was still without life. In the  hour that intervened between breathing a soul into the first man  and his becoming alive, God revealed the whole history of mankind  to him. He showed him each generation and its leaders; each  generation and its prophets; each generation and its teachers;  each generation and its scholars; each generation and its  statesmen; each generation and its judges; each generation and  its pious members; each generation and its average, commonplace  members; and each generation and its impious members. The tale of  their years, the number of their days, the reckoning of their  hours, and the measure of their steps, all were made known unto  him.[27]    Of his own free will Adam relinquished seventy of his allotted  years. His appointed span was to be a thousand years, one of the  Lord's days. But he saw that only a single minute of life was  apportioned to the great soul of David, and he made a gift of  seventy years to her, reducing his own years to nine hundred and  thirty.'    The wisdom of Adam displayed itself to greatest advantage when he  gave names to the animals. Then it appeared that God, in  combating the arguments of the angels that opposed the creation  of man, had spoken well, when He insisted that man would possess  more wisdom than they themselves. When Adam was barely an hour  old, God assembled the whole world of animals before him and the  angels. The latter were called upon to name the different kinds,  but they were not equal to the task. Adam, however, spoke without  hesitation: \"O Lord of the world! The proper name for this animal  is ox, for this one horse, for this one lion, for this one  camel.\" And so he called all in turn by name, suiting the name to  the peculiarity of the animal. Then God asked him what his name  was to be, and he said Adam, because he had been created out of  Adamah, dust of the earth. Again, God asked him His own name, and  he said: \"Adonai, Lord, because Thou art Lord over all  creatures\"--the very name God had given unto Himself, the name by  which the angels call Him, the name that will remain immutable  evermore.[29] But without the gift of the holy spirit, Adam could  not have found names for all; he was in very truth a prophet, and  his wisdom a prophetic quality.[30]    The names of the animals were not the only inheritance handed  down by Adam to the generations after him, for mankind owes all  crafts to him, especially the art of writing, and he was the  inventor of all the seventy languages.[31] And still another task  he accomplished for his descendants. God showed Adam the whole  earth, and Adam designated what places were to be settled later  by men, and what places were to remain waste.[32]      THE FALL OF SATAN    The extraordinary qualities with which Adam was blessed, physical  and spiritual as well, aroused the envy of the angels. They  attempted to consume him with fire, and he would have perished,  had not the protecting hand of God rested upon him, and  established peace between him and the heavenly host.[33] In  particular, Satan was jealous of the first man, and his evil  thoughts finally led to his fall. After Adam had been endowed  with a soul, God invited all the angels to come and pay him  reverence and homage. Satan, the greatest of the angels in  heaven, with twelve wings, instead of six like all the others,  refused to pay heed to the behest of God, saying, \"Thou didst  create us angels from the splendor of the Shekinah, and now Thou  dost command us to cast ourselves down before the creature which  Thou didst fashion out of the dust of the ground!\" God answered,  \"Yet this dust of the ground has more wisdom and understanding  than thou.\" Satan demanded a trial of wit with Adam, and God  assented thereto, saying: \"I have created beasts, birds, and  reptiles, I shall have them all come before thee and before Adam.  If thou art able to give them names, I shall command Adam to show  honor unto thee, and thou shalt rest next to the Shekinah of My  glory. But if not, and Adam calls them by the names I have  assigned to them, then thou wilt be subject to Adam, and he shall  have a place in My garden, and cultivate it.\" Thus spake God, and  He betook Himself to Paradise, Satan following Him. When Adam  beheld God, he said to his wife, \"O come, let us worship and bow  down; let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\" Now Satan  attempted to assign names to the animals. He failed with the  first two that presented themselves, the ox and the cow. God led  two others before him, the camel and the donkey, with the same  result. Then God turned to Adam, and questioned him regarding the  names of the same animals, framing His questions in such wise  that the first letter of the first word was the same as the first  letter of the name of the animal standing before him. Thus Adam  divined the proper name, and Satan was forced to acknowledge the  superiority of the first man. Nevertheless he broke out in wild  outcries that reached the heavens, and he refused to do homage  unto Adam as he had been bidden.[34] The host of angels led by  him did likewise, in spite of the urgent representations of  Michael, who was the first to prostrate himself before Adam in  order to show a good example to the other angels. Michael  addressed Satan: \"Give adoration to the image of God! But if thou  doest it not, then the Lord God will break out in wrath against  thee.\" Satan replied: \"If He breaks out in wrath against me, I  will exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will be like the  Most High!\" At once God flung Satan and his host out of heaven,  down to the earth, and from that moment dates the enmity between  Satan and man.'      WOMAN    When Adam opened his eyes the first time, and beheld the world  about him, he broke into praise of God, \"How great are Thy works,  O Lord!\" But his admiration for the world surrounding him did not  exceed the admiration all creatures conceived for Adam. They took  him to be their creator, and they all came to offer him  adoration. But he spoke: \"Why do you come to worship me? Nay, you  and I together will acknowledge the majesty and the might of Him  who hath created us all. 'The Lord reigneth,'\" he continued,  \"'He is apparelled with majesty.'\"[36]    And not alone the creatures on earth, even the angels thought  Adam the lord of all, and they were about to salute him with  \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,\" when God caused sleep  to fall upon him, and then the angels knew that he was but a  human being.[37]    The purpose of the sleep that enfolded Adam was to give him a  wife, so that the human race might develop, and all creatures  recognize the difference between God and man. When the earth  heard what God had resolved to do, it began to tremble and quake.  \"I have not the strength,\" it said, \"to provide food for the herd  of Adam's descendants.\" But God pacified it with the words, \"I  and thou together, we will find food for the herd.\" Accordingly,  time was divided between God and the earth; God took the night,  and the earth took the day.

He reflected  that whatever has a mouth can eat, and therefore the dream  of the seven lean kine that ate up the seven fat kine did not  appear strange to him. But the ears of corn that swallowed  up other ears of corn troubled his spirit.[161] He therefore  called for all the wise men of his land, and they endeavored  in vain to find a satisfactory interpretation. They explained  that the seven fat kine meant seven daughters to be born  unto Pharaoh, and the seven lean kine, that he would bury  seven daughters; the rank ears of corn meant that Pharaoh  would conquer seven countries, and the blasted ears, that  seven provinces would rebel against him.[162] About the ears  of corn they did not all agree. Some thought the good ears  stood for seven cities to be built by Pharaoh, and the seven  withered ears indicated that these same cities would be  destroyed at the end of his reign.    Sagacious as he was, Pharaoh knew that none of these  explanations hit the nail on the head. He issued a decree  summoning all interpreters of dreams to appear before him  on pain of death, and he held out great rewards and distinctions  to the one who should succeed in finding the true  meaning of his dreams. In obedience to his summons, all  the wise men appeared, the magicians and the sacred scribes  that were in Mizraim, the city of Egypt, as well as those  from Goshen, Raamses, Zoan, and the whole country of  Egypt, and with them came the princes, officers, and servants  of the king from all the cities of the land.    To all these the king narrated his dreams, but none could  interpret them to his satisfaction. Some said that the seven  fat kine were the seven legitimate kings that would rule over  Egypt, and the seven lean kine betokened seven princes that  would rise up against these seven kings and exterminate  them. The seven good ears of corn were the seven superior  princes of Egypt that would engage in a war for their overlord,  and would be defeated by as many insignificant princes,  who were betokened by the seven blasted ears.    Another interpretation was that the seven fat kine were  the seven fortified cities of Egypt, at some future time to fall  into the hands of seven Canaanitish nations, who were  foreshadowed  in the seven lean kine. According to this interpretation,  the second dream supplemented the first. It  meant that the descendants of Pharaoh would regain sovereign  authority over Egypt at a subsequent period, and  would subdue the seven Canaanitish nations as well.    There was a third interpretation, given by some: The  seven fat kine are seven women whom Pharaoh would take  to wife, but they would die during his lifetime, their loss  being indicated by the seven lean kine. Furthermore,  Pharaoh would have fourteen sons, and the seven strong  ones would be conquered by the seven weaklings, as the  blasted ears of corn in his dream had swallowed up the rank  ears of corn.    And a fourth: \"Thou wilt have seven sons, O Pharaoh,  these are the seven fat kine. These sons of thine will be  killed by the seven powerful rebellious princes. But then  seven minor princes will come, and they will kill the seven  rebels, avenge thy descendants, and restore the dominion to  thy family.\"    The king was as little pleased with these interpretations  as with the others, which he had heard before, and in his  wrath he ordered the wise men, the magicians and the scribes  of Egypt, to be killed, and the hangmen made ready to execute  the royal decree.    However, Mirod, Pharaoh's chief butler,[163] took fright,  seeing that the king was so vexed at his failure to secure an  interpretation of his dreams that he was on the point of  giving up the ghost. He was alarmed about the king's death,  for it was doubtful whether the successor to the throne would  retain him in office. He resolved to do all in his power to  keep Pharaoh alive. Therefore he stepped before him, and  spake, saying, \"I do remember two faults of mine this day,  I showed myself ungrateful to Joseph, in that I did not bring  his request before thee, and also I saw thee in distress by  reason of thy dream, without letting thee know that Joseph  can interpret dreams.[164] When it pleased the Lord God to  make Pharaoh wroth with his servants, the king put me in  ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the  chief baker.[165] And with us there was a simple young  man, one of the despised race of the Hebrews, slave to the  captain of the guard, and he interpreted our dreams to us,  and it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was.  Therefore,  O king, stay the hand of the hangmen, let them not  execute the Egyptians. The slave I speak of is still in the  dungeon, and if the king will consent to summon him  hither, he will surely interpret thy dreams.\"[166]      JOSEPH BEFORE PHARAOH    \"Accursed are the wicked that never do a wholly good  deed.\" The chief butler described Joseph contemptuously  as a \"slave\" in order that it might be impossible for him  to occupy a distinguished place at court, for it was a law  upon the statute books of Egypt that a slave could never sit  upon the throne as king, nor even put his foot in the stirrup  of a horse.[167]    Pharaoh revoked the edict of death that he had issued  against the wise men of Egypt, and he sent and called Joseph.  He impressed care upon his messengers, they were  not to excite and confuse Joseph, and render him unfit to  interpret the king's dream correctly.[168] They brought him  hastily out of the dungeon, but first Joseph, out of respect  for the king, shaved himself, and put on fresh raiment,  which an angel brought him from Paradise, and then he  came in unto Pharaoh.[169]    The king was sitting upon the royal throne, arrayed in  princely garments, clad with a golden ephod upon his breast,  and the fine gold of the ephod sparkled, and the carbuncle,  the ruby, and the emerald flamed like a torch, and all the  precious stones set upon the king's head flashed like a blazing  fire, and Joseph was greatly amazed at the appearance  of the king. The throne upon which he sat was covered  with gold and silver and with onyx stones, and it had  seventy steps. If a prince or other distinguished person  came to have an audience with the king, it was the custom  for him to advance and mount to the thirty-first step of the  throne, and the king would descend thirty-six steps and  speak to him. But if one of the people came to have speech  with the king, he ascended only to the third step, and the  king would come down four steps from his seat, and address  him thence. It was also the custom that one who knew all  the seventy languages ascended the seventy steps of the  throne to the top, but if a man knew only some of the  seventy languages, he was permitted to ascend as many steps  as he knew languages, whether they were many or, few.  And another custom of the Egyptians was that none could  reign over them unless he was master of all the seventy  languages.    When Joseph came before the king, he bowed down to  the ground, and he ascended to the third step, while the  king sat upon the fourth from the top, and spake with Joseph,  saying:[170] \"O young man, my servant beareth witness  concerning thee, that thou art the best and most discerning  person I can consult with. I pray thee, vouchsafe  unto me the same favors which thou didst bestow on this  servant of mine, and tell me what events they are which the  visions of my dreams foreshow. I desire thee to suppress  naught out of fear, nor shalt thou flatter me with lying  words, or with words that please me. Tell me the truth,  though it be sad and alarming.\"[171]    Joseph asked the king first whence he knew that the  interpretation  given by the wise men of his country was not true,  and Pharaoh replied, \"I saw the dream and its interpretation  together, and therefore they cannot make a fool of  me.\"[172] In his modesty Joseph denied that he was an adept  at interpreting dreams. He said, \"It is not in me; it is in  the hand of God, and if it be the wish of God, He will permit  me to announce tidings of peace to Pharaoh.\" And for  such modesty he was rewarded by sovereignty over Egypt,  for the Lord doth honor them that honor Him. Thus was  also Daniel rewarded for his speech to Nebuchadnezzar:    \"There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, but as for  me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I  have more than any living, but to the intent that the  interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou  mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.\"[173]    Then Pharaoh began to tell his dream, only he omitted  some points and narrated others inaccurately in order that  he might test the vaunted powers of Joseph. But the youth  corrected him, and pieced the dreams together exactly as  they had visited Pharaoh in the night, and the king was  greatly amazed.[174] Joseph was able to accomplish this feat,  because he had dreamed the same dream as Pharaoh, at the  same time as he.[175] Thereupon Pharaoh retold his dreams,  with all details and circumstances, and precisely as he had  seen them in his sleep, except that he left out the word Nile  in the description of the seven lean kine, because this river  was worshipped by the Egyptians, and he hesitated to say  that aught that is evil had come from his god.[176]    Now Joseph proceeded to give the king the true interpretation  of the two dreams. They were both a revelation concerning  the seven good years impending and the seven years  of famine to follow them. In reality, it had been the purpose  of God to bring a famine of forty-two years' duration  upon Egypt, but only two years of this distressful period  were inflicted upon the land, for the sake of the blessing of  Jacob when he came to Egypt in the second year of the  famine. The other forty years fell upon the land at"]]]
