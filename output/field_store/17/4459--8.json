On this same  date, the 11th of January, another duplication had already taken place,  that of the middle portion of the canal of the Cyclops, adjoining  Elysium. [Elysium is a part of one of the continental areas.]    \"Yet greater was my astonishment when, on the 19th of January, I saw the  canal Jamuna, which was then in the center of the disk, formed very  rigidly of two parallel straight lines, crossing the space which  separates the Niliac Lake from the Gulf of Aurora. At first sight I  believed it was an illusion, caused by fatigue of the eye and some new  kind of strabismus, but I had to yield to the evidence. After the 19th  of January I simply passed from wonder to wonder; successively the  Orontes, the Euphrates, the Phison, the Ganges, and the larger part of  the other canals, displayed themselves very clearly and indisputably  duplicated. There were not less than twenty examples of duplication, of  which seventeen were observed in the space of a month, from the 19th of  January to the 19th of February.    \"In certain cases it was possible to observe precursory symptoms which  are not lacking in interest. Thus, on the 13th of January, a light,  ill-defined shade extended alongside the Ganges; on the 18th and the  19th one could only distinguish a series of white spots; on the 20th the  shadow was still indecisive, but on the 21st the duplication was  perfectly clear, such as I observed it until the 23d of February. The  duplication of the Euphrates, of the canal of the Titans, and of the  Pyriphlegethon also began in an uncertain and nebulous form.    \"These duplications are not an optical effect depending on increase of  visual power, as happens in the observation of double stars, and it is  not the canal itself splitting in two longitudinally. Here is what is  seen: To the right or left of a pre-existing line, without any change in  the course and position of that line, one sees another line produce  itself, equal and parallel to the first, at a distance generally varying  from six to twelve degrees--i.e., from 350 to 700 kilometres (217 to 434  miles); even closer ones seem to be produced, but the telescope is not  powerful enough to distinguish them with certainty. Their tint appears  to be a quite deep reddish brown. The parallelism is sometimes  rigorously exact. There is nothing analogous in terrestrial geography.  Everything indicates that here there is an organization special to the  planet Mars, probably connected with the course of its seasons.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: L'Astronomie, vol. i, 1882, pp. 217 _et seq._]    Schiaparelli adds that he took every precaution to avoid the least  suspicion of illusion. \"I am absolutely sure,\" he says, \"of what I have  observed.\"    I have quoted his statement, especially about the duplication of the  canals, at so much length, both on account of its intrinsic interest and  because it has many times been argued that this particular phenomenon  must be illusory even though the canals are real.    One of the most significant facts that came out in the early  observations was the evident connection between the appearance of the  canals and the seasonal changes on Mars. It was about the time of the  spring equinox, when the white polar caps had begun to melt, that  Schiaparelli first noticed the phenomenon of duplication. As the season  advanced the doubling of the canals increased in frequency and the lines  became more distinct. In the meantime the polar caps were becoming  smaller. Broadly speaking, Schiaparelli's observation showed that the  doubling of the canals occurred principally a little after the spring  equinox and a little before the autumn equinox; that the phenomenon  disappeared in large part at the epoch of the winter solstice, and  disappeared altogether at the epoch of the summer solstice. Moreover, he  observed that many of the canals, without regard to duplication, were  invisible at times, and reappeared gradually; faint, scarcely visible  lines and shadows, deepened and became more distinct until they were  clearly and sharply defined, and these changes, likewise, were evidently  seasonal.    The invariable connection of the canals at their terminations with the  regions called seas, the fact that as the polar caps disappeared the  sealike expanses surrounding the polar regions deepened in color, and  other similar considerations soon led to the suggestion that there  existed on Mars a wonderful system of water circulation, whereby the  melting of the polar snows, as summer passed alternately from one  hemisphere to the other, served to reenforce the supply of water in the  seas, and, through the seas, in the canals traversing the broad  expanses of dry land that occupy the equatorial regions of the planet.  The thought naturally occurred that the canals might be of artificial  origin, and might indicate the existence of a gigantic system of  irrigation serving to maintain life upon the globe of Mars. The  geometrical perfection of the lines, their straightness, their absolute  parallelism when doubled, their remarkable tendency to radiate from  definite centers, lent strength to the hypothesis of an artificial  origin. But their enormous size, length, and number tended to stagger  belief in the ability of the inhabitants of any world to achieve a work  so stupendous.    After a time a change of view occurred concerning the nature of the  expanses called seas, and Mr. Lowell, following his observations of  1894, developed the theory of the water circulation and irrigation of  Mars in a new form. He and others observed that occasionally canals were  visible cutting straight across some of the greenish, or bluish-gray,  areas that had been regarded as seas. This fact suggested that, instead  of seas, these dark expanses may rather be areas of marshy ground  covered with vegetation which flourishes and dies away according as the  supply of water alternately increases and diminishes, while the reddish  areas known as continents are barren deserts, intersected by canals; and  as the water released by the melting of the polar snows begins to fill  the canals, vegetation springs up along their sides and becomes visible  in the form of long narrow bands.    According to this theory, the phenomena called canals are simply lines  of vegetation, the real canals being individually too small to be  detected. It may be supposed that from a central supply canal irrigation  ditches are extended for a distance of twenty or thirty miles on each  side, thus producing a strip of fertile soil from forty to sixty miles  wide, and hundreds, or in some cases two or three thousands, of miles in  length.    The water supply being limited, the inhabitants can not undertake to  irrigate the entire surface of the thirsty land, and convenience of  circulation induces them to extend the irrigated areas in the form of  long lines. The surface of Mars, according to Lowell's observation, is  remarkably flat and level, so that no serious obstacle exists to the  extension of the canal system in straight bands as undeviating as arcs  of great circles.    Wherever two or more canals meet, or cross, a rounded dark spot from a  hundred miles, or less, to three hundred miles in diameter, is seen. An  astonishing number of these appear on Mr. Lowell's charts. Occasionally,  as occurs at the singular spot named Lacus Solis, several canals  converging from all points of the compass meet at a central point like  the spokes of a wheel; in other cases, as, for instance, that of the  long canal named Eumenides, with its continuation Orcus, a single  conspicuous line is seen threading a large number of round dark spots,  which present the appearance of a row of beads upon a string. These  circular spots, which some have regarded as lakes, Mr. Lowell believes  are rather oases in the great deserts, and granting the correctness of  his theory of the canals the aptness of this designation is apparent.[2]    [Footnote 2: The reader can find many of these \"canals\" and \"oases,\" as  well as some of the other regions on Mars that have received names, in  the frontispiece.]    Wherever several canals, that is to say, several bands of vegetation or  bands of life, meet, it is reasonable to assume that an irrigated and  habitable area of considerable extent will be developed, and in such  places the imagination may picture the location of the chief centers of  population, perhaps in the form of large cities, or perhaps in groups of  smaller towns and villages. The so-called Lacus Solis is one of these  localities.    So, likewise, it seems but natural that along the course of a broad,  well-irrigated band a number of expansions should occur, driving back  the bounds of the desert, forming rounded areas of vegetation, and thus  affording a footing for population. Wherever two bands cross such areas  would be sure to exist, and in almost every instance of crossing the  telescope actually shows them.    As to the gemination or duplication of many of the lines which, at the  beginning of the season, appear single, it may be suggested that, in the  course of the development of the vast irrigation system of the planet  parallel bands of cultivation have been established, one receiving its  water supply from the canals of the other, and consequently lagging a  little behind in visibility as the water slowly percolates through the  soil and awakens the vegetation. Or else, the character of the  vegetation itself may differ as between two such parallel bands, one  being supplied with plants that spring up and mature quickly when the  soil about their roots is moistened, while the plants in the twin band  respond more slowly to stimulation.    Objection has been made to the theory of the artificial origin of the  canals of Mars on the ground, already mentioned, that the work required  to construct them would be beyond the capacity of any race of creatures"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#12)"],[1,"strain. Melt one-fourth cup of butter, add one-fourth cup flour,  and stir until well blended, then pour on gradually while constantly  heating the chicken stock and three-fourths cup scalded milk. Bring to  the boiling point and add one-half teaspoon salt, one-eighth teaspoon  paprika, two tablespoons of Parmesean cheese and one-half cup goose or  duck liver, cut in one-third inch cubes.      ~LIGHT OMELET~--Separate your eggs and beat the yolks until thick and  light colored, adding a tablespoonful cold water for each yolk and a  seasoning of salt and pepper. Beat the whites until they are dry and  will not slip from the dish, then turn into them the beaten yolks,  folding carefully until thoroughly blended. Have the pan hot and butter  melted, turn in the mixture, smothering it over the top, cover and place  on asbestos mat on top of stove until well risen, then uncover and set  in the oven to dry. Try it with a heated silver knife thrust in the  middle. When done, cut across the middle, fold and turn out, dust with  sugar, glaze and serve quickly.      ~OMELET FOR ONE~--Beat the yolks of two eggs until creamy, add four  tablespoons of milk and saltspoon of salt. Add the whites beaten stiff  and put into a hot pan in which a rounding teaspoon of butter is melted.  The mixture should begin to bubble almost at once; cook three or four  minutes, slipping a knife under now and then to keep the under side from  burning. When the top begins to set, fold it over and turn on a hot  platter.      ~SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS~--Pare, wash and slice half a pound of  fresh mushrooms, put them in a sautoir; cover, shake the sautoir once in  awhile and cook ten minutes. Break and beat five or six eggs in a  saucepan, adding seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg and one-half ounces  of butter cut into bits. Add the mushrooms, set over the fire, stir  constantly with wooden paddle, and when eggs are thick and creamy turn  into a heated dish, garnish with toasted bread points, and serve at  once.      ~SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH PEPPERS~--Scrambled eggs on toast with chopped  sweet green peppers make an excellent breakfast dish. Toast four slices  of bread, butter, and put where the platter on which they are arranged  will keep hot. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a hot frying-pan, as  soon as it bubbles turn in half a dozen eggs which have been broken into  a bowl, and mix with half a dozen tablespoonfuls of water. As the whites  begin to set, whip together quickly with a silver knife. Sprinkle over  the top two finely cut peppers from which the seeds have been removed,  stir through the eggs, let the whole cook a half minute, then pour over  the slices of toast, garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve at once.      ~SCOTCH EGGS~--Shell six hard-boiled eggs and cover with a paste made of  one-third stale breadcrumbs cooked soft in one-third cup milk, then mix  with one cup lean boiled ham minced very fine and seasoned with cayenne  pepper, one-half teaspoon mixed mustard and one raw egg beaten. Roll  slightly in fine breadcrumbs and fry in hot deep fat a delicate brown.      ~BANANAS WITH OATMEAL~--Add a teaspoonful of salt to a quart of rapidly  boiling water and sprinkle in two cups of rolled oatmeal. Set the  saucepan into another dish of boiling water (double boiler), cover and  cook at least one hour. Longer cooking is preferable. Have ready half a  banana for each person to be served. The banana should be peeled and cut  in thin slices. Put a spoonful of the hot oatmeal over the bananas in  the serving dishes. Pass at the same time sugar and milk or cream. Other  cereals may be served with bananas in the same way.      ~SPAWN AND MILK~--Have the water boiling fast. Salt to taste, then  holding a handful of meal high in the left hand, let it sift slowly  between the fingers into the bubbling water, stirring all the time with  the right hand. Stir until a thin, smooth consistency obtains, then push  back on the fire where it will cook slowly for several hours, stirring  occasionally with a \"pudding stick\" or wooden spoon. It will thicken as  it cooks. Serve in bowls with plenty of good rich milk.      ~BOILED SAMP~--Soak two cupfuls over night in cold water. In the morning  wash thoroughly, cover with boiling water, and simmer gently all day. Do  not stir, as that tends to make it mushy, but shake the pot frequently.  As the water boils away add more, but not enough to make much liquid.  About a half hour before serving add a cupful rich milk, tablespoon  butter, and salt to season. Let this boil up once, and serve hot.      ~MOLDED CEREAL WITH BANANA SURPRISE~--Turn any left-over breakfast  cereal, while still hot, into cups rinsed in cold water, half filling  the cups. When cold, scoop out the centers and fill the open spaces with  sliced bananas, turn from the cups onto a buttered agate pan, fruit  downward, and set into a hot oven to become very hot. Remove with a  broad-bladed knife to cereal dishes. Serve at once with sugar and cream  or milk.      ~THICKENED BUTTER~--Place in a saucepan the yolks of a couple of eggs.  Break them gently with a spoon, adding four ounces of butter, melted but  not browned. Set the pan over a slow fire, stirring until of the  required consistency.      ~SHRIMP BUTTER~--Pick and shell one pound of shrimps, place them in a  mortar and pound, add one-half pound of butter when well mixed; pass the  whole through a fine sieve. The butter is then ready for use.      ~SARDINE BUTTER~--Remove the skins and bones from seven or eight  sardines; put them in a mortar and pound until smooth. Boil two large  handfuls of parsley until tender, squeeze it as dry as possible, remove  all stalks and stems and chop it. Put the parsley in the mortar with the  fish and four ounces of butter, then pound again. When well incorporated  mold the butter into shapes. Keep on ice until ready for serving.  Excellent for hot toast.      ~MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER~--Quarter of a pound of butter, two  tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, salt and pepper and juice of two  lemons. Mix thoroughly and keep in cool place.      ~CAULIFLOWER IN MAYONNAISE~--Select some large, cold boiled cauliflowers  and break into small branches, adding a little salt, pepper and vinegar  to properly season. Heap them on a dish to form a point. Surround with a  garnish of cooked carrots, turnips and green vegetables, pour some white  mayonnaise sauce over all, and serve.      ~SARDINE COCKTAIL~--Drain and skin one-half box boneless sardines and  separate into small pieces. Add one-half cup tomato catsup, mixed with  two teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, one-half teaspoon tabasco sauce, the  juice of one lemon, and salt to taste. Chill thoroughly and serve in  scallop shells, placing each shell on a plate of crushed ice.      ~SAUCE FOR VARIOUS SHELLFISH IN THE SHAPE OF COCKTAIL~--For the truffle  sauce melt three tablespoons of butter, add three tablespoons of flour,  and stir until well blended, then pour on gradually while heating  constantly one cup milk and one-half cup heavy cream. Bring to the  boiling point and add two chopped truffles, two tablespoons Madeira  wine, salt and pepper to taste.      ~BAKED MILK~--Put fresh milk into a stone jar, cover with white paper  and bake in a moderate oven until the milk is thick as cream. This may  be taken by the most delicate stomach.      ~MINT VINEGAR~--Fill in a wide-mouthed bottle or a quart fruit jar with  fresh mint leaves, well washed and bruised a little. Let the leaves fall  in without pressing. Fill the jar with cider vinegar, put on the  rubber, and turn the cover tightly. Let stand three weeks, uncover, and  drain off the vinegar into bottles and keep well corked.      ~BLACKBERRY VINEGAR~--Mash the berries to a pulp in an earthenware or  wooden vessel. Add good cider vinegar to cover and stand in sun during  the day and in the cellar at night, stirring occasionally. Next morning  strain and add the same amount fresh berries. Crush and pour the whole,  the strained juice, and set in the sun again all day and in the cellar  at night. The third day strain to each quart of the juice one pint water  and five pounds sugar. Heat slowly and when at boiling point skim, and  after it boils strain and bottle.      ~HOMEMADE VINEGAR~--For pineapple vinegar, cover the parings and some of  the fruit, if you wish, with water. A stone crock or glass jar is the  best receptacle for this purpose. Add sugar or sirup, according to the  condition of the fruit, and set in the sun where it can ferment  thoroughly. Skim frequently to remove all impurities, and when as acid  as desired, strain and bottle. Gooseberry vinegar is made by crushing  gooseberries not quite ripe, covering with cold water (three quarts of  water to two of fruit) and allowing it to stand for two days. Press and  strain. Allow a pint of sugar and half a yeast cake to each gallon of  the liquid. Set in the sun, and when the fluid has worked clear, strain  and leave in a warm place until as sharp as desired. A cloth should be  tied over the top of the jar to keep out insects and dust.      ~SAMP AND BEANS~--Soak a quart of the samp and a scant pint pea beans  over night in cold water, each in a separate vessel. In the morning put  the samp over to cook in a large pot, covering with fresh boiling water.  Simmer gently about two hours, protecting from scorch, by an asbestos  mat and a frequent shaking of the pot. As the samp commences to swell  and the water dries out add more. After two hours add the beans that  have been soaking, together with a pound of streaked salt pork. Season  with salt and pepper and continue the cooking all day, shaking  frequently. Just before serving add butter and more salt if it needs it.      ~DRESSING FOR ITALIAN RAVIOLI~--Nine eggs beaten very light. One quart  of spinach boiled and drained until dry. Chop very fine. Add salt and  pepper to taste, one cup grated American cream cheese, little nutmeg,  one-half"]]]
