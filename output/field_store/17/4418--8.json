By another change the god Horus, who used to be a  crowned king of manly stature, was now a child holding a finger to his  mouth, and thereby marking that he had not yet learned to talk. The  Romans, who did not understand this Egyptian symbol for youthfulness,  thought that in this character he was commanding silence; and they gave  the name of Harpocrates, _Horus the powerful_, to a god of silence.  Horus was also often placed as a child in the arms of his mother Isis;  and thus by the loving nature of the group were awakened the more tender  feelings of the worshipper. The Egyptians, like the Greeks, had always  been loud in declaring that they were beloved by their gods; but they  received their favours with little gratitude, and hardly professed that  they felt any love towards the gods in return. But after the time of the  Christian era, we meet with more kindly feelings even among the pagans.  We find from the Greek names of persons that they at least had begun to  think their gods deserving of love, and in this group of the mother and  child, such a favourite also in Christian art, we see in what direction  these more kindly feelings found an entrance into the Egyptian religion.  As fast as opinion was raising the great god Serapis above his fellows  and making the wrathful judge into the ruler of the world, so fast was  the same opinion creating for itself a harbour of refuge in the child  Horus and its mother.    [Illustration: 080.jpg HARPOCRATES]    The deep earnestness of the Egyptians in the belief of their own  religion was the chief cause of its being adopted by others. The Greeks  had borrowed much from it. Though in Rome it had been forbidden by law,  it was much cultivated there in private; and the engraved rings on the  fingers of the wealthy Romans which bore the figures of Harpocrates and  other Egyptian gods easily escaped the notice of the magistrate. But the  superstitious Domitian, who was in the habit of consulting astrologers  and Chaldaean fortune-tellers, allowed the Egyptian worship. He built  at Rome a temple to Isis, and another to Serapis; and such was the  eagerness of the citizens for pictures of the mother goddess with her  child in her arms that, according to Juvenal, the Roman painters all  lived upon the goddess Isis. For her temple in the Campus Martius, holy  water was even brought from the Nile to purify the building and the  votaries; and a regular college of priests was maintained there by their  zeal and at their cost, with a splendour worthy of the Roman capital.  Domitian, also, was somewhat of a scholar, and he sent to Alexandria for  copies of their books, to restore the public library at Rome which had  been lately burnt; while his garden on the banks of the Tiber was  richer in the Egyptian winter rose than even the gardens of Memphis and  Alexandria.    During this century the coinage continues one of the subjects of chief  interest to the antiquary. In 92 A.D., in the eleventh year of his  reign, when Domitian took upon himself the tribunitian power at Rome  for a second period of ten years, the event was celebrated in Alexandria  with a triumphal procession and games in the hippodrome, of all which we  see clear traces on the Egyptian coins.    [Illustration: 081.jpg COINS OF DOMITIAN]    The coinage is almost the only trace of Nerva (96--98 A.D.) having  reigned in Egypt; but it is at the same time enough to prove the  mildness of his government. The Jews who by their own law were of old  required to pay half a shekel, or a didrachm, to the service of their  temple, had on their conquest been made to pay that sum as a yearly  tribute to the Ptolemies, and afterwards to the emperors. It was a  poll-tax levied on every Jew throughout the empire. But Nerva had the  humanity to relieve them from this insulting tribute, and well did he  deserve the honour of having it recorded on the coins struck in his  reign.    The coinage of the eleventh year of his successor, Trajan (98-117  A.D.), is very remarkable for its beauty, its technical skill, and  variety, even more so than that of the eleventh year of Domitian.    [Illustration: 082.jpg COIN OF NERVA]    The coins have hitherto proclaimed, in a manner unmistakably plain to  those who study numismatics, the games and conquests of the emperors,  the bountiful overflow of the Nile, and sometimes the worship of  Serapis; but we now enter upon the most brilliant and most important  period of the Egyptian coinage, and find a rich variety of fables taken  both from Egyptian and Greek mythology. The coins of Rome in this and  the following reigns show the wealth, good taste, and learning of the  nation, but they are surpassed by the coins of Egypt. While history  is nearly silent, and the buildings and other proofs of Roman good  government have perished, the coins alone are quite enough to prove  the well-being of the people. Among the Egyptian coins those of Trajan,  Hadrian, and the Antonines equal in number those of all the other  emperors together, while in beauty they far surpass them. They are  mostly of copper, of a small size, and thick, weighing about one hundred  and ten grains, and some larger of two hundred and twenty grains; the  silver coins are less common, and of mixed metal.    Though the Romans, while admiring and copying everything that was Greek,  affected to look upon the Egyptians as savages, who were only known to  be human beings by their power of speech, still the Egyptian physicians  were held by them in the highest repute. The more wealthy Romans often  sailed to Alexandria for the benefit of their advice. Pliny the Elder,  however, thought that of the invalids who went to Egypt for their  health more were cured by the sea voyage than by the physicians on their  arrival.    [Illustration: 083.jpg TRINITY OF ISIS, HORUS AND NEPHTHYS]    One of Cicero's physicians was an Egyptian. Pliny the Younger repaid his  Egyptian oculist, Harpocrates, by getting a rescript from the emperor  to make him a Roman citizen. But the statesman did not know under what  harsh laws his friend was born, for the grant was void in the case of an  Egyptian, the emperor's rescript was bad as being against the law; and  Pliny had again to beg the greater favour that the Egyptian might first  be made a citizen of Alexandria, without which the former favour was  useless. Thus, even in Alexandria, a conquered province governed by  the despotic will of a military emperor, there were still some laws or  principles which the emperor found it not easy to break. The courts of  justice, those to whom the edicts were addressed and by whom they were  to be explained and carried into effect, claimed a power in some cases  above the emperor; and the first article in the Roman code was that an  imperial rescript, by whomsoever or howsoever obtained, was void if it  was against the law. As the lawyers and magistrates formed part of the  body of citizens, the Alexandrians had so far a share in the government  of their own affairs; but this was an advantage that the Egyptians lost  by being under the power of the Greek magistrates.    [Illustration: 084.jpg COINS OF TRAJAN]    Trajan always kept in the public granaries of Rome a supply of Egyptian  grain equal to seven times the _canon_, or yearly gift to the poor  citizens; and in this prudent course he was followed by all his  successors, until the store was squandered by the worthless Elagabalus.  One year, when the Nile did not rise to its usual height, and much of  the grain land of the Delta, instead of being moistened by its waters  and enriched by its mud, was left a dry, sandy plain, the granaries of  Rome were unlocked to feed the city of Alexandria. The Alexandrians then  saw the unusual sight of ships unloading their cargoes of wheat in their  harbour, and the Romans boasted that they took the Egyptian tribute  in grain, not because they could not feed themselves, but because the  Egyptians had nothing else to send them.    Alexandria under the Romans was still the centre of the trading world,  not only having its own great trade in grain, but being the port through  which the trade of India and Arabia passed to Europe, and at which the  Syrian vessels touched in their way to Italy. The harbour was crowded  with masts and strange prows and uncouth sails, and the quays always  busy with loading and unloading; while in the streets might be seen men  of all languages and all dresses, copper-coloured Egyptians, swarthy  Jews, lively, bustling Greeks, and haughty Italians, with Asiatics from  the neighbouring coasts of Syria and Cilicia, and even dark Ethiopians,  painted Arabs, Bactrians, Scythians, Persians, and Indians, all gay with  their national costumes. Alexandria was a spot in which Europe met Asia,  and each wondered at the strangeness of the other.    Of the Alexandrians themselves we receive a very unfavourable account  from their countryman, Dion Chrysostom. With their wealth, they  had those vices which usually follow or cause the loss of national  independence. They were eager for nothing but food and horse-races. They  were grave and quiet in their sacrifices and listless in business, but  in the theatre or in the stadium men, women, and children were alike  heated into passion, and overcome with eagerness and warmth of feeling.  A scurrilous song or a horse-race would so rouse them into a quarrel  that they could not hear for their own noise, nor see for the dust  raised by their own bustle in the hippodrome; while all those acts of  their rulers, which in a more wholesome state of society would have  called for notice, passed by unheeded.    [Illustration: 086.jpg EGYPTIAN WIG (BRITISH MUSEUM)]    They cared more for the tumble of a favourite charioteer than for the  sinking state of the nation.

At this period the population of Egypt was, like the towns that covered  it, a mixture of the wrecks of several nations,--Kopts, the survivors of  the ancient inhabitants of the land; Arabs, who conquered Egypt from  the Kopts; and Turks, the conquerors of the Arabs. On the arrival of  the French, the Kopts amounted at most to two hundred thousand:  poor, despised, brutalised, they had devoted themselves, like all the  proscribed classes, to the most ignoble occupations. The Arabs formed  almost the entire mass of the population. Their condition was infinitely  varied: some were of high birth, carrying back their pedigree to  Muhammed himself; and some were landed proprietors, possessing traces  of Arabian knowledge, and combining with nobility the functions of the  priesthood and the magistracy, who, under the title of sheikhs, were the  real aristocracy of Egypt.    [Illustration: 091.jpg THE PROPHET MUHAMMED]         The original of the illustration (upon the opposite page) is       to be seen in a finely illuminated MS. of the ninth century,       A. D., preserved in the India Office, London. The picture is       of peculiar interest, being the only known portrait of       Muhammed, who is evidently represented as receiving the       divine command to propagate Muhammedanism.    In the divans, they represented the country, when its tyrants wished  to address themselves to it; in the mosques, they formed a kind of  university, in which they taught the religion and the morality of the  Koran, and a little philosophy and jurisprudence. The great mosque of  Jemil-Azar constituted the foremost learned and religious body in the  East. Next to these grandees came the smaller landholders, composing the  second and more numerous class of the Arabs; then the great mass of the  inhabitants, who had sunk into the state of absolute helots. These last  were hired peasants or fellahs who cultivated the land, and lived in  abject poverty. There was also a class of Arabs, namely, the Bedouins  or rovers, who would never attach themselves to the soil, but were the  children of the desert. These wandering Arabs, divided into tribes  on both sides of the valley, numbered nearly one hundred and twenty  thousand, and could furnish from twenty to twenty-five thousand horse.  They were brave, but fit only to harass the enemy, not to fight him. The  third and last race was that of the Turks; but it was not more numerous  than the Kopts, amounting to about two hundred thousand souls at most,  and was divided into Turks and Mamluks. The Turks were nearly all  enrolled in the list of janizaries; but it is well known that they  frequently had their names inscribed in those lists, that they might  enjoy the privileges of janizaries, and that a very small number of them  were really in the service. Very few of them composed the military force  of the pasha. This pasha, sent from Constantinople, was the sultan's  representative in Egypt; but, escorted by only a few janizaries, he  found his authority invalidated by the very precautions which Sultan  Selim had formerly taken to preserve it. That sultan, judging that  Egypt was likely from its remoteness to throw off the dominion of  Constantinople, and that a clever and ambitious pasha might create there  an independent empire, had, as we have seen, devised a plan to frustrate  such a motive, should it exist, by instituting a Mamluk soldiery; but it  was the Mamluks, and not the pasha, who rendered themselves independent  of Constantinople and the masters of Egypt.    Egypt was at this time an absolute feudality, like that of Europe in  the Middle Ages. It exhibited at once a conquered people, a conquering  soldiery in rebellion against its sovereign, and, lastly, an ancient  degenerate class, who served and were in the pay of the strongest.    Two beys, superior to the rest, ruled Egypt: the one, Ibrahim Bey,  wealthy, crafty, and powerful; the other, Murad Bey, intrepid,  valiant, and full of ardour. They had agreed upon a sort of division  of authority, by which Ibrahim Bey had the civil, and Murad Bey the  military, power. It was the business of the latter to fight; he excelled  in it, and he possessed the affection of the Mam-luks, who were all  eager to follow him.    Bonaparte immediately perceived the line of policy which he had to  pursue in Egypt. He must, in the first place, wrest that country from  its real masters, the Mam-luks; it was necessary for him to fight them,  and to destroy them by arms and by policy. He had, moreover, strong  reasons to urge against them; for they had never ceased to ill-treat the  French. As for the Porte, it was requisite that he should not appear to  attack its sovereignty, but affect, on the contrary, to respect it.  In the state to which it was reduced, that sovereignty was not to be  dreaded, and he could treat with the Porte, either for the cession of  Egypt, by granting certain advantages elsewhere, or for a partition of  authority, in which there would be nothing detrimental; for the French,  in leaving the pasha at Cairo, and transferring to themselves the power  of the Mamluks, would not occasion much regret. As for the inhabitants,  in order to make sure of their attachment, it would be requisite to win  over the Arab population. By respecting the sheikhs, by flattering their  old pride, by increasing their power, by encouraging their secret desire  for the re-establishment of their ancient glories, Bonaparte reckoned  upon ruling the land, and attaching it entirely to him. By afterwards  sparing persons and property, among a people accustomed to consider  conquest as conferring a right to murder, pillage, and devastate, he  would create a sentiment that would be most advantageous to the French  army. If, furthermore, the French were to respect women and the Prophet,  the conquest of hearts would be as firmly secured as that of the soil.    Napoleon conducted himself agreeably to these conclusions, which  were equally just and profound. He immediately made his plans for  establishing the French authority at Alexandria, and for quitting the  Delta and gaining possession of Cairo, the capital of Egypt. It was  the month of July; the Nile was about to inundate the country. He was  anxious to reach Cairo before the inundation, and to employ the time  during which it should last in establishing himself there. He ordered  everything at Alexandria to be left in the same state as formerly; that  the religious exercises should be continued; and that justice should be  administered as before by the cadis. His intention was merely to possess  himself of the rights of the Mamluks, and to appoint a commissioner to  levy the accustomed imposts. He caused a divan, or municipal council,  composed of the sheikhs and principal persons of Alexandria, to be  formed, in order to consult them on all the measures which the French  authority would have to take. He left three thousand men in garrison in  Alexandria, and gave the command of it to Kleber, whose wound was liable  to keep him in a state of inactivity for a month or two. He directed a  young Frenchman of extraordinary merit, and who gave promise of becoming  a great engineer, to put Alexandria in a state of defence, and to  construct there all the necessary works. This was Colonel Cretin,  who, in a short time, and at a small expense, executed superb works at  Alexandria. Bonaparte then ordered the fleet to be put in a place of  security. It was a question whether the large ships could enter the port  of Alexandria. A commission of naval officers was appointed to sound the  harbour and make a report. Meanwhile, the fleet was anchored in the road  of Abukir, and Bonaparte ordered Brueys to see to it that this question  should be speedily decided, and to proceed to Corfu if it should be  ascertained that the ships could not enter the harbour of Alexandria.    After he had attended to all these matters, he made preparations for  marching. A considerable flotilla, laden with provisions, artillery,  ammunition, and baggage, was to run along the coast to the Rosetta  mouth, enter the Nile, and ascend the river at the same time as the  French army. He then set out with the main body of the army, which,  after leaving the two garrisons in Malta and Alexandria, was about  thirty thousand strong. He had ordered his flotilla to proceed as high  as Ramanieh, on the banks of the Nile. There he purposed to join it, and  to proceed up the Nile parallel with it, in order to quit the Delta and  to reach Upper Egypt, or Bahireh. There were two roads from Alexandria  to Ramanieh; one through an inhabited country, along the sea-coast and  the Nile, and the other shorter and as the bird flies, but across the  desert of Damanhour. Bonaparte, without hesitation, chose the shorter.  It was of consequence that he should reach Cairo as speedily as  possible. De-saix marched with the advanced guard, and the main body  followed at a distance of a few leagues. They started on the 6th of  July. When the soldiers found themselves amidst this boundless plain,  with a shifting sand beneath their feet, a scorching sun over their  heads, without water, without shade, with nothing for the eye to rest  upon but rare clumps of palm-trees, seeing no living creatures but small  troops of Arab horsemen, who appeared and disappeared at the horizon,  and sometimes concealed themselves behind sand-hills to murder the  laggards, they were profoundly dejected. They found all the wells, which  at intervals border the road through the desert, destroyed by the Arabs.  There were left only a few drops of brackish water, wholly insufficient  for quenching their thirst.    [Illustration: 097.jpg STREET DOGS]    They had been informed that they should find"]]]
