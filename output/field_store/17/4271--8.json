In whatever sense this may have been written, and whatever the      interpretation that may be put upon it, there is one sense in      which it is absolutely and eternally true, and that is, that, in      order to be perfect, a man's life must be as pronounced on the      negative side as the positive, in its denials as in its      affirmations, and that it is futile to attempt to obey God      unless one at the same time renounce all co-partnery with the      devil. Circumcision is the symbol of this renunciation, and it      is only as such it has any radical spiritual significance. Till      he was circumcised, it is said, God did not speak to Abraham in      Hebrew. Not till then is sacredness of speech, any more than      sacredness of life, possible. Doubtless among the Jews      circumcision was the symbol of their separation from the ethnic      religions; and hence the jealousy with which their prophets      looked upon any compromise with idolatry. Hatred of that, utter      and intense, was the one essential negative pole of genuine      Judaism, and circumcision was its sign and seal.    Abraham was the first of the proselytes.    _Succah_, fol. 49, col. 2.    Abraham it was that ordained the form of prayer for morning worship,  which is extant to this very day.    _Berachoth_, fol. 26, col. 2.    As he himself was pious, so were his very camels, for they would not  enter into a place where there were idols; as it is written (Gen. xxiv.  31), \"I have prepared,\" i.e., removed the idols from, \"the house and  room for the camels.\"    _Avoth d' Rabbi Nathan_, chap. 8.    Abraham had a daughter, and her name was Bakol.    Ibid., fol. 16, col. 2.    Abraham was free from evil passion.    _Bava Bathra_ fol. 17, col. 1.    He was also free from the Angel of Death.    Ibid., fol. 17, col. 1.    He delivered to the children he had by Keturah a secret name, with which  they learned to practice witchcraft and do the works of the devil.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 91, col. 1.    Though great, he personally waited on his guests, who had the appearance  of Arabs and not of angels.    _Kiddushin_, fol. 32, col. 2.    Rabbi Yehudah says Abraham planted an ornamental garden with all kinds  of choice fruits in it, and Rabbi Nehemiah says he erected an inn for  travelers in order to make known the name of God to all who sojourned in  it.    _Soteh_, fol. 10, col. 1.        Both the Targum of Ben Uzziel and the Yerushalmi say that      Abraham planted a paradise at Beersheba for the entertainment      and delectation of his guests; and in Jasher (chap, xxvii. verse      37) it is said that \"Abraham formed a grove and planted a      vineyard there, and had always ready in his tent meat and drink      for those that passed through the land, so that they might      satisfy themselves in his house.\"    He ranked as one of the seven shepherds of Israel (Micah v. 5). In this  group David was the central figure, with Adam, Seth, and Methusaleh on  his right hand, and Abraham, Jacob, and Moses on his left.    _Succah_, fol. 52, col. 2.    The coin of Jerusalem had the impress of David and Solomon on the one  side, and the holy city of Jerusalem on the other. But the impress on  the coin of our father Abraham was an old man and an old woman on one  side, and a young man and a damsel on the other.    _Bava Kama_, fol. 37, col. 2.        This, it is to be presumed, must be taken in some symbolical      sense, for coins cannot be traced back to a date so early as      this; and when Abraham purchased the cave to bury Sarah in from      the sons of Heth, we read that he weighed to Ephron the silver.    Abraham pleaded with God on the behalf of Israel and said, \"While there  is a Temple they will get their sins atoned for, but when there shall be  no Temple, what will become of them?\" God, in answer to his prayer,  assured him that He had prepared a prayer for them, by which, as often  as they read it, He would be propitiated and would pardon all their  sins.    _Meggillah_, fol. 31, col. 2.    He was punished by his posterity being compelled to serve the Egyptians  two hundred and ten years, because he had pressed the Rabbis under his  tuition into military service in the expedition he had undertaken to  recover Lot from those who had carried him off captive; for it is  written (Gen. xiv. 14), \"He armed his instructed.\" Samuel says Abraham  was punished because he perversely distrusted the assurance of God; as  it is written (Gen. xv. 8), \"Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit  it?\"    _Nedarim_, fol. 31, col. 2.    Abraham was thrown into a fiery furnace by Nimrod, and God would not  permit Gabriel to rescue him, but did so Himself; because God is One and  Abraham was one, therefore it behooved the One to rescue the one.    _P'sachim_, fol. 118, col. 1.        The fire from which Abraham is here said to be delivered may      simply refer to his deliverance by the hand of God from Ur of      the Chaldees; Ur meaning \"fire,\" and being the name of a place      celebrated for fire worship. The Midrash (p. 20) says, \"When the      wicked Nimrod cast Abraham into the furnace, Gabriel said, 'Lord      of the universe! permit me to deliver this holy one from the      fire!' But the Lord made answer, 'I am the One Supreme in my      world, and he is supreme in his; it is fitting therefore that      the Supreme should rescue the supreme.'\"    Abraham was a giant of giants; his height was as that of seventy-four  men put together. His food, his drink, and his strength were in the  proportion of seventy-four men's to one man's. He built an iron city for  the abode of his seventeen children by Keturah, the walls of which were  so lofty that the sun never penetrated them: he gave them a bowl full of  precious stones, the brilliancy of which supplied them with light in the  absence of the sun.    _Sophrim_, chap. 21.    Abraham our father had a precious stone suspended from his neck, and  every sick person that gazed upon it was immediately healed of his  disease. But when Abraham died, God hung up the stone on the sphere of  the sun.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 16, col. 2.    Till Abraham's time there was no such thing as a beard; but as many  mistook Abraham for Isaac, and Isaac for Abraham, they looked so exactly  alike, Abraham prayed to God for a beard to enable people to distinguish  him from his son, Isaac, and it was granted him; as it is written (Gen.  xxiv. 1), \"And to Abraham a beard came when he was well stricken in  age.\"    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 107, col. 2.        Here the word which the translators of the English version      render \"was old,\" is taken in another of its cognate meanings as      a beard. The Midrash is a trifle more modest in this legendary      assertion. There we read, \"Before Abraham there was no special      mark of old age,\" and that for distinction's sake \"the beard was      made to turn gray.\"    When he died, all the chiefs of the nations of the world stood in a line  and exclaimed, \"Alas for the world that has lost its leader! Alas for  the ship that has lost its helmsman!\"    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 91, col. 2.    As Rabbi Banna went about to measure and to mark off the outward and  inward dimensions of the different caves, when he came to the cave of  Machpelah he found Eliezar, Abraham's servant, at the entrance, and  asked him, \"What is Abraham doing?\" The answer he received was, \"He is  asleep in the arms of Sarah.\"    Ibid., fol. 58, col. 1.        Abraham being greater than Moses, for while the latter is only      called by God \"My Servant\" (Mal. iv. 4), the former is called      \"My Friend\" (Isa. xli. 8), we devote a little more space for a      few more extracts from other Jewish sources than the Talmud, in      order to make the picture they supply of Abraham's character a      little more complete.    Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says:--\"The Holy One--blessed be He!--took Shem  and separated him to be a priest to Himself, that he might serve before  Him. He also caused His Shechinah to rest with him, and called his name  Melchizedek, priest of the Most High and king of Salem. His brother  Japheth even studied the law in his school, until Abraham came and also  learned the law in the school of Shem, where God Himself instructed  Abraham, so that all else he had learned from the lips of man was  forgotten. Then came Abraham and prayed to God that His Shechinah might  ever rest in the house of Shem, which also was promised to him; as it is  said (Ps. ex. 4), 'Thou art a priest forever after the order of  Melchizedek.'\"    _Avodath Hakkodesh_, part 3, chap. 20.    Wherever Jacob resided he studied the law as his fathers did. How is  this, seeing the law had not yet been given, it is nevertheless written  of Abraham (Gen. xxvi. 5), \"And he kept my charge\"? Whence then did  Abraham learn the law? Rabbi Shimon says his reins (literally kidneys)  were made like two water-jars, from which the law flowed forth. Where do  we learn that it was so? From what is said in Ps. xvi. 7, \"My reins also  instruct me in the night season.\"    _Bereshith Rabba_, chap. 95.    The masters of the Kabbalah, of blessed memory, say that Abraham's  Rabbi, i.e., teacher, was the angel Zadkiel.    _Rabbi Menachem's comment on the Pent._, Exod. iii. 5.    Adam's book, which contained celestial mysteries and holy wisdom, came  down as an heirloom into the hands of Abraham, and he by means of it was  able to see the glory of his Lord.    _Zohar Parashah Bereshith._    Abraham was the author of a treatise on the subject of different kinds  of witchcraft and its unholy workings and fruits, as also of the Book of  Creation, through holy names (by means of which, namely, anything could  be created).    _Nishmath "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#12)"],[1,"airy body, in which  the sensitive power doth all of it through the whole immediately  apprehend all variety of sensibles.  And if it be demanded to how it  comes to pass that this spirit becomes organized in sepulchres, and most  commonly of human form, but sometimes in the forms of other animals, to  this those Ancients replied that their appearing so frequently in human  form proceeded from their being incrassated with evil diet, and then, as  it were, stamped upon with the form of this exterior ambient body in  which they are, as crystal is formed and coloured like to those things  which it is fastened in, or reflects the image of them.  And that their  having sometimes other different forms proceedeth from the phantastic  power of the soul itself, which can at pleasure transform the spirituous  body into any shape.  For being airy, when it is condensed and fixed, it  becometh visible, and again invisible and vanishing out of sight when it  is expanded and rarified.\"  Proem in Arist. de Anima.  And Cudworth  says, \"Though spirits or ghosts had certain supple bodies which they  could so far condense as to make them sometimes visible to men, yet is  it reasonable enough to think that they could not constipate or fix them  into such a firmness, grossness and solidity, as that of flesh and bone  is to continue therein, or at least not without such difficulty and pain  as would hinder them from attempting the same.  Notwithstanding which it  is not denied that they may possibly sometimes make use of other solid  bodies, moving and acting them, as in that famous story of Phlegons when  the body vanished not as other ghosts use to do, but was left a dead  carcase behind.\"    In all these speculations the Anima Mundi plays a conspicuous part.  It  is the source and principle of all animal souls, including the  irrational soul of man.  But in man, who would otherwise be merely  analogous to other terrestrial animals--this soul participates in a  higher principle, which tends to raise and convert it to itself.  To  comprehend the nature of this union or hypostasis it would be necessary  to have mastered the whole of Plato's philosophy as comprised in the  Parmenides and the Timaeus;  and he would dogmatize rashly who without  this arduous preparation should claim Plato as the champion of an  unconditional immortality.  Certainly in the Phaedo the dialogue  popularly supposed to contain all Plato's teaching on the subject--the  immortality allotted to the impure soul is of a very questionable  character, and we should rather infer from the account there given that  the human personality, at all events, is lost by successive immersions  into \"matter.\"  The following passage from Plutarch (quoted by Madame  Blavatsky, \"Isis Unveiled,\" vol. ii. p. 284) will at least demonstrate  the antiquity of notions which have recently been mistaken for fanciful  novelties.  \"Every soul hath some portion of nous, reason, a man cannot  be a man without it;  but as much of each soul as is mixed with flesh  and appetite is changed, and through pain and pleasure becomes  irrational.  Every soul doth not mix herself after one sort;  some  plunge themselves into the body, and so in this life their whole frame  is corrupted by appetite and passion;  others are mixed as to some part,  but the purer part still remains without the body.  It is not drawn down  into the body, but it swims above, and touches the extremest part of the  man's head;  it is like a cord to hold up and direct the subsiding part  of the soul, as long as it proves obedient and is not overcome by the  appetites of the flesh.  The part that is plunged into the body is  called soul.  But the incorruptible part is called the nous, and the  vulgar think it is within them, as they likewise imagine the image  reflected from a glass to be in that glass.  But the more intelligent,  who know it to be without, call it a Daemon.\"  And in the same learned  work (\"Isis Unveiled \") we have two Christian authorities, Irenaeus and  Origen, cited for like distinction between spirit and soul in such a  manner as to show that the former must necessarily be regarded as  separable from the latter.  In the distinction itself there is of course  no novelty for the most moderately well-informed.  It is insisted upon  in many modern works, among which may be mentioned Heard's \"Trichotomy  of Man\" and Green's \"Spiritual Philosophy\";  the latter being an  exposition of Coleridge's opinion on this and cognate subjects.  But the  difficulty of regarding the two principles as separable in fact as well  as in logic arises from the senses, if it is not the illusion of  personal identity.  That we are particle, and that one part only is  immortal, the non-metaphysical mind rejects with the indignation which  is always encountered by a proposition that is at once distasteful and  unintelligible.  Yet perhaps it is not a greater difficulty (if, indeed,  it is not the very same) than that hard saying which troubled Nicodemus,  and which has been the key-note of the mystical religious consciousness  ever since.  This, however, is too extensive and deep a question to be  treated in this paper, which has for its object chiefly to call  attention to the distinctions introduced by ancient thought into the  conception of body as the instrument or \"vehicle\" of soul.  That there  is a correspondence between the spiritual condition of man and the  medium of his objective activity every spiritualist will admit to be  probable, and it may well be that some light is thrown on future states  by the possibility or the manner of spirit communication with this one.    --C. C. Massey          The Nilgiri Sannyasis      I was told that Sannyasis were sometimes met with on a mountain called  Velly Mallai Hills, in the Coimbatore District, and trying to meet with  one, I determined to ascend this mountain.  I traveled up its steep  sides and arrived at an opening, narrow and low, into which I crept on  all fours.  Going up some twenty yards I reached a cave, into the  opening of which I thrust my head and shoulders.  I could see into it  clearly, but felt a cold wind on my face, as if there was some opening  or crevice--so I looked carefully, but could see nothing.  The room was  about twelve feet square.  I did not go into it.  I saw arranged round  its sides stones one cubit long, all placed upright.  I was much  disappointed at there being no Sannyasi, and came back as I went,  pushing myself backwards as there was no room to turn.  I was then told  Sannyasis had been met with in the dense sholas (thickets), and as my  work lay often in such places, I determined to prosecute my search, and  did so diligently, without, however, any success.    One day I contemplated a journey to Coimbatore on my own affairs, and  was walking up the road trying to make a bargain with a handy man whom I  desired to engage to carry me there;  but as we could not come to terms,  I parted with him and turned into the Lovedale Road at 6 P.M.  I had not  gone far when I met a man dressed like a Sannyasi, who stopped and spoke  to me.  He observed a ring on my finger and asked me to give it to him.  I said he was welcome to it, but inquired what he would give me in  return, he said, \"I don't care particularly about it;  I would rather  have that flour and sugar in the bundle on your back.\"  \"I will give you  that with pleasure,\" I said, and took down my bundle and gave it to him.  \"Half is enough for me,\" he said;  but subsequently changing his mind  added, \"now let me see what is in your bundle,\" pointing to my other  parcel.  \"I can't give you that.\"  He said, \"Why cannot you give me your  swami (family idol)?\"  I said, \"It is my swami, I will not part with it;  rather take my life.\"  On this he pressed me no more, but said, \"Now you  had better go home.\"  I said, \"I will not leave you.\"  \"Oh you must,\" he  said, \"you will die here of hunger.\"  \"Never mind,\" I said, \"I can but  die once.\"  \"You have no clothes to protect you from the wind and rain;  you may meet with tigers,\" he said.  \"I don't care,\" I replied.  \"It is  given to man once to die.  What does it signify how he dies?\"  When I  said this he took my hand and embraced me, and immediately I became  unconscious.  When I returned to consciousness, I found myself with the  Sannyasi in a place new to me on a hill, near a large rock and with a  big shola near.  I saw in the shola right in front of us, that there was  a pillar of fire, like a tree almost.  I asked the Sannyasi what was  that like a high fire.  \"Oh,\" he said, \"most likely a tree ignited by  some careless wood-cutters.\"    \"No,\" I said, \"it is not like any common fire--there is no smoke, nor  are there flames--and it's not lurid and red.  I want to go and see it.\"  \"No, you must not do so, you cannot go near that fire and escape alive.\"  \"Come with me then,\" I begged.  \"No--I cannot,\" he said, \"if you wish to  approach it, you must go alone and at your own risk;  that tree is the  tree of knowledge and from it flows the milk of life:  whoever drinks  this never hungers again.\"  Thereupon I regarded the tree with awe.    I next observed five Sannyasis approaching.  They came up and joined the  one with me, entered into talk, and finally pulled out a hookah and  began to smoke.  They asked me if I could smoke.  I said no.  One of  them said to me, let us see the swami in your bundle (here gives a  description of the same).  I said, \"I cannot, I am not clean enough to  do so.\"  \"Why not perform your ablutions in yonder stream?\" they said.  \"If you sprinkle water on your forehead that will suffice.\"  I went to  wash my hands and feet, and laved my head, and showed it to them.  Next  they disappeared.  \"As it is very late, it is time you returned home,\"  said my first friend.  \"No,\" I said, \"now I have found you I will not  leave you.\"  \"No, no,\" he said, \"you must go home.  You cannot leave the  world yet;  you are a father and "]]]
