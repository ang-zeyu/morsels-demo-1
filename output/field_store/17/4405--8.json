At that time the Christian  religion was a religion of fear rather than of love, and men were  continually picturing in their minds God's angry separation of the  good from the wicked.    How much such thoughts occupied them we may see from Dante's great  poem describing a vision of the Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise.  This was written in the thirteenth century, and in the same period  appeared a short Latin lyric, or hymn, called \"Dies Irae,\" or the Day  of Wrath, from an expression used by the old Hebrew prophet Zephaniah.  The author was a Franciscan monk named Thomas of Celano, and we may  see how deeply he felt from these verses:--        \"Ah! what terror is impending      When the Judge is seen descending,      And each secret veil is rending.        \"To the throne, the trumpet sounding,      Through the sepulchres resounding,      Summons all, with voice astounding.        \"Sits the Judge, the raised arraigning,      Darkest mysteries explaining,      Nothing unavenged remaining.\"    This vivid word picture forms the subject of many great paintings by  the older Italian masters, known under the title of the Last Judgment.  Michelangelo's was one of the last of these, and in general  arrangement his composition resembles those of his predecessors.    From the upper air a company of angels descends, carrying a cross, a  crown of thorns, and other instruments of the Saviour's sufferings.  Below them is the Judge himself surrounded by the apostles and other  saints. Underneath are the archangels blowing their trumpets. On  earth, in the lowest part of the picture at the left, the dead rise  from their graves and ascend through the air to the Judge. At the  right, opposite the ascending dead, are the condemned sinners,  descending to the boat which will carry them over the river Styx into  the Inferno.    [Illustration: CENTRAL FIGURES OF THE LAST JUDGMENT. _Sistine Chapel,  Rome._]    Our illustration gives only the central figures in this great  multitude, the Divine Judge accompanied by his mother. He is a man of  mighty muscular power, young and handsome, with an expression of  imperious dignity. Enthroned on the clouds, he seems just rising from  a sitting posture to execute his judgments. He lifts his arms in a  sweeping motion as if to part the multitudes pressing upon him on both  sides. In so doing he shows the wound in his right side made by the  soldier's spear at the crucifixion. Neither expression nor gesture  manifests anger; those beautiful hands with delicately extended  fingers will strike no blow. The gesture itself is a command.    Beneath Christ's upraised arm, on his right side, sits his Mother  Mary. Each must interpret for himself her attitude and expression.  Some think that because she turns her face away she is shrinking from  her son in terror. Yet her expression is so gentle that others say she  is nestling close to him for protection. This is certainly as we  should imagine the situation. When she was a young mother, she was  proud to take care of her child. And now on this great day she is  equally proud to let him take care of her. As he clung to her, his  mother, so she now clings to him, the Judge.    Looking at the composition of the picture, we see that her figure  completes a pyramid, whose apex is the uplifted hand of the Judge,  and whose base lies along the cloud supporting his feet and hers. This  gives proper stability to the figures which dominate the whole great  picture. Considered in a larger way, the pyramid is itself the upper  part of a long oval which keeps the central group apart from the  surrounding host.    The picture of the Last Judgment was painted by Michelangelo on the  end wall of the Sistine Chapel, over the altar, nearly twenty years  after the completion of the ceiling frescoes. There is a great  difference between the two works. The figures on the ceiling are  strong and powerful, their attitudes spirited and graceful. Those in  the Last Judgment are huge and cumbersome, their attitudes strained  and violent. The entire effect of the vast company of colossal figures  is awe-inspiring, but not pleasing.    It is a relief to fix our eyes upon the central portion. Here the  painter expressed an idea at once noble and original. The figure of  the Christ has not the delicate beauty of the dead Christ in the  Pieta, or the finished elegance of the Christ Triumphant, but he has  the splendid vigor of a forceful character. The Mother, less grand and  noble than in the bereavement of the Pieta, less proud than in her  young motherhood, is a gentle and lovely creature. Thus the intensely  masculine is completed by the delicately feminine, and the artist  shows us ideal types of manhood and womanhood.          XVI    PORTRAIT      In the pictures of this collection we have learned something of the  work of Michelangelo as a sculptor and a painter. He was an artist  whose personality was so strongly impressed upon his work that we have  come thus to know, to a certain extent, the man himself. His, as we  have seen, was not a happy nature, and many of the circumstances of  his life conspired against his happiness.    In his early youth he seemed strangely aware of his own superior gifts  and was often so overbearing that he made enemies. The story is told  of a quarrel he had with a young man named Torrigiano, in whose  company he was copying some frescoes in a church in Florence. Stung by  some tormenting words of Michelangelo, Torrigiano retaliated with a  blow of the fist, which crushed his companion's nose, and disfigured  him for life.    Michelangelo's real education began in the palace of Lorenzo the  Magnificent, who discovered the lad's talent and made him a favorite.  \"He sat at the same table with Ficino, Pico, and Poliziano, listening  to dialogues on Plato, and drinking in the golden poetry of Greece.  Greek literature and philosophy, expounded by the men who had  discovered them, first moulded his mind to those lofty thoughts which  it became the task of his life to express in form. At the same time he  heard the preaching of Savonarola. In the Duomo and the cloister of S.  Marco another portion of his soul was touched, and he acquired that  deep religious tone which gives its majesty and terror to the  Sistine.\"[37] In the gardens of S. Marco he had Lorenzo's fine  collection of antiquities to study, and learned from them the secrets  of Greek sculpture.    [Footnote 37: Symonds, in _Renaissance in Italy: The Fine Arts_.]    In all these opportunities it would seem that Michelangelo was a most  fortunate person. Nor did he lack proper appreciation; the Pieta  placed him at once on a pinnacle of fame, and the David was heartily  admired.    It was when he entered the service of the Pope that his troubles  began. He was never thereafter a free man. His genius was at the  disposition of a series of men, each ambitious for his own fame, and  caring little for the artist's personal aspirations. His proud nature  was bitterly humiliated by this sacrifice of his independence.  Sometimes he openly rebelled, but in the end was always obliged to  yield to papal authority.    Michelangelo's sternly upright spirit found also much to sadden him in  the corruption of the times. He was a lover of righteousness as well  as a lover of liberty, and he greatly mourned the evils which  surrounded him.    One of the pleasantest traits in his character was his warm affection  for the members of his family and for the few whom he honored with his  friendship. One of the latter was Vittoria Colonna, a woman of strong  and beautiful character, who brought much brightness into his life.    Our portrait shows him somewhat past middle life when occupied with  many important concerns. We can read in the face something of the  character of the man. It is certainly not a handsome face, for any  good looks he might once have boasted were destroyed by his broken  nose. It is nevertheless a face full of rugged strength, with not a  little kindliness in the expression. Here is a man whose enmity we  should avoid, but whose friendship we should value above rubies.    It is the face of a lonely man. Michelangelo had to suffer the  loneliness of genius. No one could fully understand him. He stood  apart, towering like a giant above his fellow men.    On the four hundredth anniversary of Michelangelo's birthday, some  verses were written by an American poet, Christopher Cranch, which one  should read while looking at this portrait:--        \"This is the rugged face      Of him who won a place      Above all kings and lords;      Whose various skill and power      Left Italy a dower      No numbers can compute, no tongue translate in words.        \"Patient to train and school      His genius to the rule      Art's sternest laws required;      Yet, by no custom chained,      His daring hand disdained      The academic forms by tamer souls admired.        \"In his interior light      Awoke those shapes of might      Once known that never die;      Forms of titanic birth,      The elder brood of earth,      That fill the mind more grandly than they charm the eye.        \"Yet when the master chose,      Ideal graces rose      Like flowers on gnarled boughs;      For he was nursed and fed      At beauty's fountain head      And to the goddess pledged his earliest warmest vows.\"    The poet describes still further the artist's character, and then  enumerates some of his great works. Whatever occupied him--        \"Still proudly poised, he stepped      The way his vision swept,      And scorned the narrower view.      He "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#12)"],[1,"\"question\"  in the schools. They were aided in this by a powerful instrument, then  first employed in Turkey, the press.[12] A newspaper in Arabic called  the _Jawaib_ was subsidized at Constantinople under the direction of  one Achmet Faris, a convert to Islam and a man of great literary ability  and knowledge of Arabic, who already had views on the subject of the  Caliphate; and this organ henceforth consistently advocated the new  policy of the Ulema.    The official clique in Stamboul were, however, at that time still intent  on other projects, and only half understood the part to be played by  religion in their scheme of administrative reform for the Empire.  Besides--and this was the chief hindrance to the Ulema--Abd el Aziz was  not a man capable of seriously carrying out a great political idea,  being little else than a man of pleasure. He and his government  consequently soon drifted back into the groove of his predecessors'  material policy, which relied for its strength on the physical force of  arms, foreign loans, and the intrigues of officials. The only practical  action taken by Ottoman ministers in the line indicated were the twin  crusades proclaimed against the Wahhabis of Hasa and the heretical Imams  of Sana. But the Hanefite Ulema were not thus to be satisfied. They had  determined on carrying out the idea they had adopted, and on forcing the  Sultan to put himself openly at the head of a religious and reactionary  movement; and when they found that Abd el Aziz could not be made to act  consistently as Caliph, they deposed him, and thus opened a way for the  true hero of their idea, the present Sultan, Abd el Hamid.    The advent of this latest scion of the house of Othman to the spiritual  succession of the Prophet, though a godsend in appearance to religious  Moslems, cannot but be regarded by all who wish Islam well as a very  great misfortune. It is almost certain that if Abd el Mejid and Abd el  Aziz had been succeeded by another of those senseless monarchs who have  so often filled the Imperial throne, the Ottoman Caliphate would already  have been a thing of the past, at least as regards the larger and more  intelligent part of Islam. In the collapse of its physical power in  1879, the official camarilla of Constantinople would have been unable to  control the movement of revolt against the spiritual and temporal  sovereignty of the Sultan, and something would have taken its place  offering a more possible foundation for true religious reform. Arabia  would in all probability have by this time asserted its independence,  and under a new Caliphate of the Koreysh would have been attracting the  sympathies and the adhesion of the Eastern world. There might have been  schisms and religious convulsions, but at least there would have been  life; and what Islam requires is to live. But unfortunately Abd el Hamid  was neither a mere voluptuary nor an imbecile, and catching, by an  instinct which one cannot but admire, the one rope of safety which  remained for him and his house, he placed himself at the head of the  extreme reactionary party of Islam, and thus put back for a while the  hour of fate.    It is difficult to gain accurate information as to Abd el Hamid's  character and religious opinions, but I believe it may be safely  asserted that he represents in these latter the extremest Hanefite  views. In youth he was, for a prince, a serious man, showing a taste for  learning, especially for geography and history; and though not an _alem_  he has some knowledge of his religion. It may therefore be taken for  granted that he is sincere in his belief of his own spiritual  position--it is easy to be sincere where one's interest lies in  believing; and I have it from one who saw him at the time that on the  day soon after his accession, when, according to the custom already  mentioned, he received the sword at the mosque of Ayub, he astonished  his courtiers with the sudden change in his demeanour. All the afternoon  of that day he talked to them of his spiritual rank in language which  for centuries had not been heard in the precincts of the Seraglio. It is  certain, too, that his first act, when delivered from the pressure of  the Russian invasion, was to organize afresh the propagandism already  begun, and to send out new missionaries to India and the Barbary States  to preach the doctrine of his own Caliphal authority to the Moslems _in  partibus infidelium_. His language, too, to strangers from external  Islam was from the first that of a spiritual rather than a temporal  prince, and with the European Ambassadors he has used this position  consistently and most effectually.    It is no mean proof of Abd el Hamid's ability that he should have  invented the Mussulman _non possumus_ with which he has disconcerted our  diplomacy. In private life he is said to be regular at his prayers,  though it is also said that he conforms to the custom of Turkish Sultans  in avoiding legal marriage. He is at the same time a liberal patron of  dervishes, workers of miracles, and holy men. These he is at pains to  seek out and receive honourably. In his administration he conforms,  wherever he is himself the actor, strictly to the Sheriat, and on  doubtful points consults always the mufti or Sheykh el Islam. He has  shown no inconsiderable firmness in resisting European demands when they  contravened the canon law.[13]    For all these reasons it will be readily understood that Abd el Hamid  has gained not only the support of his own Turkish Ulema, but the  sympathy of a very considerable section of opinion outside his  dominions. From a traitor to the cause of religion the Ottoman Sultan  has come to be looked upon, east and west, as once more its champion;  and with the old-fashioned reactionary school Abd el Hamid is fast  growing into a hero. A year ago, when I was at Jeddah, this was not yet  the case, but it would seem to be so now. Then even the people of his  own party spoke of him doubtfully, and he certainly excited no  enthusiasm among them. They did not understand him, and thought that he  was playing a part. He was said to be of Armenian parentage (on his  mother's side) and his sincerity as a Moslem was suspected. It seemed  impossible one born in Abd el Mejid's Seraglio should be a serious man.  Besides, he had not yet shown his strength, and to be strong is to be a  hero everywhere.    But within the last eight months, events have marched rapidly. Abd el  Hamid has played his cards successfully in Greece, in Albania, and with  the Kurds. He has not been afraid of England and has shown a bold front  against infidel reforms. He has had the courage under the eyes of Europe  to arrest their _protege_, Midhat, and to try him for murder. Lastly,  the French have played into his hands in Tunis, and he has thus gained a  footing of sympathy with the Mussulmans of North Africa, a population  which has for centuries opposed his claims. Twenty years ago it would  have been absolutely impossible for an Ottoman Sultan to awaken any  loyal feeling in any Arab breast. Tunis then specially boasted her  independence of the Porte, and all but the Hanefite rulers of the  sea-coast towns of Africa would have scouted the idea of fighting for  the Turk. Now the Malekites themselves, the puritans of Kerwan, are  moving at Abd el Hamid's nod. He would seem, too, to be stirring with  some success in Egypt, and Indian Mussulmans are praying for him  publicly in their mosques. Everywhere the reactionary party is standing  to its arms, and is beginning to recognize a leader in this supple  Armenian Khalifeh, who is defying Europe, and seems willing, if  necessary, to lead them one day on a Jehad.    With all this, however, it must not be supposed that Orthodox Islam is  by any means yet won back to Constantinople. Turkey, I have shown, and  the Hanefite school, are far from being the whole of the Mohammedan  world; and side by side with the fanatical obduracy of the Ottoman State  party and the still fiercer puritanism of the Melkites there exists an  intelligent and hopeful party favourable to religious reform. Shafite  Egypt is its stronghold, but it is powerful too in Arabia and further  East. With it a first article of faith is that the House of Othman has  been and is the curse of Islam, and that its end is at hand.    In spite of Abd el Hamid's pious appeals to the Sheriat they look upon  him as one who troubleth Islam. He is the representative of the party  most bitterly opposed to all of good. They know that as long as there is  an Ottoman Caliph, whether his name be Abd el Aziz or Abd el Hamid,  moral progress is impossible, that the ijtahad cannot be re-opened, and  that no such reformation of doctrine and practice can be attempted as  would alone enable their faith to cope with modern infidelity. They see  moreover that, notwithstanding his affected legality, Abd el Hamid's  rule is neither juster nor more in accordance with the Mussulman law  than that of his predecessors. The same vices of administration are  found in it, and the same recklessness for his Mussulman subjects'  welfare. Of all the lands of Islam his own are probably those where Abd  el Hamid has now the most scanty following. Constantinople is after all  his weak point, for the Young Turkish school is far from dead, the  vicissitudes of life and death follow each other closely on the  Bosphorus, and the liberal party can better afford than the reactionary  to wait. The death or fall of Abd el Hamid, whenever it may happen,  would immediately decide a movement counter to the Ottoman Caliphate.    FOOTNOTES:    [10] I do not vouch for the entire accuracy of these dates. Turkish  historians place Selim's death in 926 A.H., which should correspond with  our 1520.
