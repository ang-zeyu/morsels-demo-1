The hundreds (except centum) are declined like the Plural of bonus.    5. Mille is regularly an adjective in the Singular, and indeclinable. In  the Plural it is a substantive (followed by the Genitive of the objects  enumerated; Sec. 201, 1), and is declined,--      _Nom._  milia       _Acc._  milia    _Gen._  milium      _Voc._  milia    _Dat._  milibus     _Abl._  milibus    Thus mille homines, _a thousand men_; but duo milia hominum, _two thousand  men_, literally _two thousands of men_.      a. Occasionally the Singular admits the Genitive construction; as, mille    hominum.    6. Other Cardinals are indeclinable. Ordinals and Distributives are  declined like Adjectives of the First and Second Declensions.    Peculiarities in the Use of Numerals.    81. 1. The compounds from 21 to 99 may be expressed either with the larger  or the smaller numeral first. In the latter case, et is used. Thus:--        triginta sex or sex et triginta, _thirty-six_.    2. The numerals under 90, ending in 8 and 9, are often expressed by  subtraction; as,--        duodeviginti, _eighteen_ (but also octodecim);        undequadraginta, _thirty-nine_ (but also triginta novem or novem et      triginta).    3. Compounds over 100 regularly have the largest number first; the others  follow without et; as,--        centum viginti septem, _one hundred and twenty-seven_.        anno octingentesimo octogesimo secundo, _in the year 882_.    Yet et may be inserted where the smaller number is either a digit or one of  the tens; as,--        centum et septem, _one hundred and seven_;        centum et quadraginta, _one hundred and forty_.    4. The Distributives are used--      a) To denote _so much each_, _so many apiece_; as,--        bina talenta eis dedit, _he gave them two talents each_.      b) When those nouns that are ordinarily Plural in form, but Singular in    meaning, are employed in a Plural sense; as,--        binae litterae, _two epistles_.      But in such cases, uni (not singuli) is regularly employed for _one_, and    trini (not terni) for three; as,--        unae litterae, _one epistle_; trinae litterae, _three epistles_.      c) In multiplication; as,--        bis bina sunt quattuor, _twice two are four_.      d) Often in poetry, instead of the cardinals; as,--        bina hastilia, _two spears_.           *       *       *       *       *    C. PRONOUNS.    82. A Pronoun is a word that indicates something without naming it.    83. There are the following classes of pronouns:--         I.  Personal.                V.  Intensive.      II.  Reflexive.              VI.  Relative.     III.  Possessive.            VII.  Interrogative.      IV.  Demonstrative.        VIII.  Indefinite.    I. PERSONAL PRONOUNS.    84. These correspond to the English _I_, _you_, _he_, _she_, _it_, etc.,  and are declined as follows:--              First Person.     Second Person.    Third Person.                                SINGULAR.    _Nom._  ego, _I_          tu, _thou_        is, _he_; ea, _she_; id,                                                _it_    _Gen._  mei               tui               (For declension see Sec. 87.)    _Dat._  mihi[22]          tibi[22]    _Acc._  me                te    _Voc._  ----              tu    _Abl._  me                te                                PLURAL.    _Nom._  nos, _we_         vos, _you_    _Gen._  nostrum, nostri   vestrum, vestri    _Dat._  nobis             vobis    _Acc._  nos               vos    _Voc._  ----              vos    _Abl._  nobis             vobis    1. A Dative Singular mi occurs in poetry.    2. Emphatic forms in -met are occasionally found; as, egomet, _I myself_;  tibimet, _to you yourself_; tu has tute and tutemet (written also tutimet).    3. In early Latin, med and ted occur as Accusative and Ablative forms.           *       *       *       *       *    II. REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS.    85. These refer to the subject of the sentence or clause in which they  stand; like _myself_, _yourself_, in '_I see myself_,' etc. They are  declined as follows:--              _First Person._         _Second Person._        _Third Person._            Supplied by oblique     Supplied by oblique            cases of ego.           cases of tu.    _Gen._  mei, _of myself_        tui, _of thyself_       sui    _Dat._  mihi, _to myself_       tibi, _to thyself_      sibi[22]    _Acc._  me, _myself_            te, _thyself_           se or sese    _Voc._  ----                    ----                    ----    _Abl._  me, _with myself_,      te, _with thyself_,     se or sese            etc.                    etc.    1. The Reflexive of the Third Person serves for _all genders_ and for _both  numbers_. Thus sui may mean, _of himself_, _herself_, _itself_, or _of  themselves_; and so with the other forms.    2. All of the Reflexive Pronouns have at times a _reciprocal_ force; as,--        inter se pugnant, _they fight with each other_.    3. In early Latin, sed occurs as Accusative and Ablative.           *       *       *       *       *    III. POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS.    86. These are strictly adjectives of the First and Second Declensions, and  are inflected as such. They are--      _First Person._                 _Second Person._    meus, -a, -um, _my_;            tuus, -a, -um, _thy_;    noster, nostra, nostrum,        vester, vestra, vestrum,    _our_;                          _your_;                      _Third Person._                    suus, -a, -um, _his_, _her_, _its_, _their_.    1. Suus is exclusively Reflexive; as,--        pater liberos suos amat, _the father loves his children_.    Otherwise, _his_, _her_, _its_ are regularly expressed by the Genitive  Singular of is, viz. ejus; and _their_ by the Genitive Plural, eorum,  earum.    2. The Vocative Singular Masculine of meus is mi.    3. The enclitic -pte may be joined to the Ablative Singular of the  Possessive Pronouns for the purpose of emphasis. This is particularly  common in case of suo, sua; as, suopte, suapte.           *       *       *       *       *    IV. DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.    87. These point out an object as here or there, or as previously mentioned.  They are--      hic, _this_ (where I am);    iste, _that_ (where you are);    ille, _that_ (something distinct from the speaker);    is, _that_ (weaker than ille);    idem, _the same_.    Hic, iste, and ille are accordingly the Demonstratives of the First,  Second, and Third Persons respectively.                                     Hic, _this_.

FEMININE."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15673"],[0,"The Day of the Beast (#12)"],[1,"women--Mel Iden, strangest and saddest of mysteries--a girl  who had been noble, aloof, proud, with a heart of golden fire, now  disgraced, ruined, the mother of a war-baby, and yet, strangest of  all, not vile, not bad, not lost, but groping like he was down those  vast and naked shores of life. He wept for the hard-faced Mrs. Wrapp,  whose ideal had been wealth and who had found prosperity bitter ashes  at her lips, yet who preserved in this modern maelstrom some sense of  its falseness, its baseness. He wept for Helen, playmate of the years  never to return, sweetheart of his youth, betrayer of his manhood, the  young woman of the present, blase, unsexed, seeking, provocative, all  perhaps, as she had said, that men had made her--a travesty on  splendid girlhood. He wept for her friends, embodying in them all of  their class--for little Bessy Bell, with her exquisite golden beauty,  her wonderful smile that was a light of joy--a child of fifteen with  character and mind, not yet sullied, not yet wholly victim to the  unstable spirit of the day.    And traveling in this army that seemed to march before Lane's eyes  were the slackers, like Mackay and Swann, representative of that horde  of cowards who in one way or another had avoided the service--the  young men who put comfort, ease, safety, pleasure before all else--who  had no ideal of womanhood--who could not have protected women--who  would not fight to save women from the apish Huns--who remained behind  to fall in the wreck of the war's degeneration, and to dance, to  drink, to smoke, to ride the women to their debasement.    And for the first and the last time Lane wept for himself, pitifully  as a child lost and helpless, as a strong man facing irreparable loss,  as a boy who had dreamed beautiful dreams, who had loved and given  and trusted, who had suffered insupportable agonies of body and soul,  who had fought like a lion for what he represented to himself, who had  killed and killed--and whose reward was change, indifference, betrayal  and death.    That dark hour passed. Lane lay spent in the blackness of his room.  His heart had broken. But his spirit was as unquenchable as the fire  of the sun. If he had a year, a month, a week, a day longer to live he  could never live it untrue to himself. Life had marked him to be a  sufferer, a victim. But nothing could kill his soul. And his soul was  his faith--something he understood as faith in God or nature or  life--in the reason for his being--in his vision of the future.    How then to spend this last remnant of his life! No one would guess  what passed through his lonely soul. No one would care. But out of the  suffering that now seemed to give him spirit and wisdom and charity  there dawned a longing to help, to save. He would return good for  evil. All had failed him, but he would fail no one.    Then he had a strange intense desire to understand the present. Only a  day home--and what colossal enigma! The war had been chaos. Was this  its aftermath? Had people been rocked on their foundations? What were  they doing--how living--how changing? He would see, and be grateful  for a little time to prove his faith. He knew he would find the same  thing in others that existed in himself.    He would help his mother, and cheer her, and try to revive something  of hope in her. He would bend a keen and patient eye upon Lorna, and  take the place of her father, and be kind, loving, yet blunt to her,  and show her the inevitable end of this dancing, dallying road.  Perhaps he could influence Helen. He would see the little  soldier-worshipping Bessy Bell, and if by talking hours and hours, by  telling the whole of his awful experience of war, he could take up  some of the time so fraught with peril for her, he would welcome the  ordeal of memory. And Mel Iden--how thought of her seemed tinged with  strange regret! Once she and he had been dear friends, and because of  a falsehood told by Helen that friendship had not been what it might  have been. Suppose Mel, instead of Helen, had loved him and been  engaged to him! Would he have been jilted and would Mel have been  lost? No! It was a subtle thing--that answer of his spirit. It did not  agree with Mel Iden's frank confession.    It might be difficult, he reflected, to approach Mel. But he would  find a way. He would rest a few days--then find where she lived and go  to see her. Could he help her? And he had an infinite exaltation in  his power to help any one who had suffered. Lane recalled Mel's pale  sweet face, the shadowed eyes, the sad tremulous lips. And this image  of her seemed the most lasting of the impressions of the day.          CHAPTER V      The arbiters of social fate in Middleville assembled at Mrs. Maynard's  on a Monday afternoon, presumably to partake of tea. Seldom, however,  did they meet without adding zest to the occasion by a pricking down  of names.    Mrs. Wrapp was the leading spirit of this self-appointed tribunal--a  circumstance of expanding, resentment to Mrs. Maynard, who had once  held the reins with aristocratic hands. Mrs. Kingsley, the third  member of the great triangle, claimed an ancestor on the Mayflower,  which was in her estimation a guerdon of blue blood. Her elaborate and  exclusive entertainments could never be rivalled by those of Mrs.  Wrapp. She was a widow with one child, the daughter Elinor, a girl of  nineteen.    Mrs. Maynard was tall, pale, and worldly. Traces of lost beauty  flashed in her rare smiles. When Frank Maynard had failed in business  she had shrouded her soul in bitterness; and she saw the slow cruel  years whiten his head and bend his shoulders with the cold eye of a  woman who had no forgiveness for failure. After Mr. Maynard's reverse,  all that kept the pair together were the son Blair, and the sweet,  fair-haired, delicate Margaret, a girl of eighteen, whom the father  loved, and for whom the mother had large ambitions. They still  managed, in ways mysterious to the curious, to keep their fine  residence in the River Park suburb of Middleville.    On this April afternoon the tea was neglected in the cups, and there  was nothing of the usual mild gossip. The discussion involved Daren  Lane, and when two of those social arbiters settled back in their  chairs the open sesame of Middleville's select affairs had been denied  to him.    \"Why did he do it?\" asked Mrs. Kingsley.    \"He must have been under the influence of liquor,\" replied Mrs.  Maynard, who had her own reasons for being relieved at the disgrace of  Daren Lane.    \"No, Jane, you're wrong,\" spoke up Mrs. Wrapp, who, whatever else she  might be, was blunt and fair-minded. \"Lane wasn't drunk. He never  drank before the war. I knew him well. He and Helen had a puppy-love  affair--they were engaged before Lane went to war. Well, the day after  his return he called on us. And if I never liked him before I liked  him then. He's come back to die! He was ill for two weeks--and then he  crawled out of bed again. I met him down town one day. He really  looked better, and told me with a sad smile that he had 'his ups and  downs'.... No, Lane wasn't drunk at Fanchon Smith's dance the other  night. I was there, and I was with Mrs. Smith when Lane came up to us.  If ever I saw a cool, smooth, handsome devil it was Lane.... Well, he  said what he said. I thought Mrs. Smith would faint. It is my idea  Lane had a deep motive back of his remark about Fanchon's dress and  her dancing. The fact is Lane was _sick_ at what he saw--sick and  angry. And he wanted Fanchon's mother and me to know what he  thought.\"    \"It was an insult,\" declared Mrs. Maynard, vehemently.    \"It made Mrs. Smith ill,\" added Mrs. Kingsley. \"She told me Fanchon  tormented the life out of her, trying to learn what Lane said. Mrs.  Smith would not tell. But Fanchon came to me and _I_ told her. Such a  perfectly furious girl! She'll not wear _that_ dress or dance _that_  dance very soon again. The story is all over town.\"    \"Friends, there are two sides to every question,\" interposed the  forceful Mrs. Wrapp. \"If Lane cared to be popular he would have used  more tact. But I don't think his remark was an insult. It was pretty  raw, I admit. But the dress was indecent and the dance was rotten.  Helen told me Fanchon was half shot. So how could she be insulted?\"    Mrs. Maynard and Mrs. Kingsley, as usual, received Mrs. Wrapp's  caustic and rather crude opinions with as good grace as they could  muster. Plain it was that they felt themselves a shade removed from  this younger and newer member of society. But they could not show  direct antagonism to her influence any more than they could understand  the common sense and justice of her arguments.    \"No one will ever invite him again,\" declared Mrs. Maynard.    \"He's done in Middleville,\" echoed Mrs. Kingsley. And that perhaps was  a gauntlet thrown.    \"Rot!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wrapp, with more force than elegance. \"I'll  invite Daren Lane to my house.... You women don't get the point.  Daren Lane is a soldier come home to die. He gave himself. And he  returns to find all--all this sickening--oh, what shall I call it?  What does he care whether or not we invite him? Can't you see that?\"    \"There's a good deal in what you say,\" returned Mrs. Kingsley,  influenced by the stronger spirit. \"Maybe Lane hated the new styles. I  don't blame him much. There's something wrong with our young people.  The girls are crazy. The boys are wild. Few of them are marrying--or  even getting engaged. They'll do _anything_. The times are different.  And we mothers don't know our daughters.\"    \"Well, I know _mine_\" returned Mrs. Maynard, loftily. \"What you say  may be true generally, but there are exceptions. My daughter has been  too well brought up.\"    \"Yes, Margie is well-bred,\" retorted Mrs. Wrapp. \"We'll admit she  hasn't gone to extremes, as most of our girls have. But I want to  observe to you that she has been a wall-flower for a year.\"   "]]]
