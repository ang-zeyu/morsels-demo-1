You have astonished the world, I am  virtue incarnate. Virtue is never vain. As you have stuck to me all  along, I must reward you. I will send you to the heaven of _Brahma_,  where the greatest kings cannot enter by their truth, charity,  straightforwardness and sacrifices. You need not lament any more. Be  patient. By my blessing, your son Rohitashya will instantly regain  life\". Rohitashya now starts up.    Then the king perceives, in clear vision acquired by the blessings of  Virtue, that lord Kausika, in order to try his virtue, deprived him of  his kingdom and placed the government in the hands of his own minister.  The Chandal, who is his master, is not a real character but virtue  incarnate.    The Brahmin and his wife, who were the master and mistress of the queen,  were not ordinary persons. The Brahmin was Siva, the god of gods,  incarnate. The Brahmani was the goddess Durga incarnate. By order of  virtue, the king and queen annoint, on the banks of the Ganges,  Rohitashya as king-associate or Yuvaraja, and return to the capital,  amidst the wild rejoicings of the subjects.    After a short stay there, the happy couple repair to the heaven of  _Brahma_.          MADHURANIRUDDHA.      The secret loves of Usha, the daughter of the Asura Bana, and Aniruddha,  the grandson of Krishna, are intense. The sage Nareda apprises Krishna  and Balarama, that Indra is again in dread of the demons, and especially  of Bana, who has acquired the particular favour of Siva, and who is  therefore not to be easily subdued. The conference ends by Nareda's  going to Sonapur, the capital of the demon, to endeavour to impair the  friendship between Bana and Siva, whilst Krishna and his brother await  the result.    The excessive arrogance of Bana, in his anxiety to match himself with  Vishnu, has offended the latter, who has accordingly departed for  Kailas, after announcing that Bana's anxiety shall be alleviated  whenever his banner falls. Parvati has also gone to Kailas, after  announcing to Usha that she will shortly behold her lover. Usha is  impatient for the boon conferred by the goddess.    Aniruddha is violently enamoured of a damsel he has seen in his sleep,  and despairs of discovering who she is, when Nareda comes opportunely to  his aid, and informs him that she is the daughter of Bana; on which  Aniruddha determines to go to his capital, first propitiating Jwalamukhi  by penance, in order to obtain the means of entering a city surrounded  by a wall of perpetual flame. The goddess is the form of Durga,  worshipped wherever a subterraneous flame breaks forth, or wherever  jets of carburetted hydrogen gas are emitted from the soil.    Bana's banner has fallen. His minister and wife endeavour to prevail on  him to propitiate Siva, in order to avert the evil omen, but he refuses.    Bringi, a servant of Durga, precedes Aniruddha to prepare the goddess to  grant his request. As he proceeds in his aerial car, he notices the  countries of Orissa, Bengal, Behar, Oude or Ayodhya, Prayaga, Hastinapur  or Delhi and Kurujangal or Tahneser, whence he comes to Jwalamukhi.    Aniruddha repairs to the shrine of the goddess round which goblins  sport, and upon the point of offering himself as a sacrifice, is  prevented by the goddess and receives from her the power of travelling  through the air.    Usha and Chitralekha, her companion, receive a visit from Nareda, in  whose presence the latter unfolds a picture containing portraits of all  the chief characters in Swerga, Patala, and on earth, or Indra, and  other gods; Sesha, Takshaka and the Nagas, and different princes, as the  kings of Magadha, Mathura, Avanti, Madra, Mahishmati, and Viderbha,  Yudhishthira, Krishna, Baladeva, Pradyumna, and finally Aniruddha, whom  Usha recognizes as the individual seen in her dream, and of whom she is  enamoured. Nareda recommends that Chitralekha be sent to Dwaravati to  invite Aniruddha, whom he enables to fly thither, whilst he remains in  charge of Usha, whom he sends to the garden to await her lover's  arrival.    Aniruddha and Chitralekha arrive at Sonapur and the former is united to  his mistress.    Aniruddha is detected by Bana. An engagement ensues. Krishna, Baladeva,  and Pradyumna coming to the aid of the prince, the day is going ill with  Bana, when Kartikeya, Ganesha, and Siva and Chandi come to his succour.  Notwithstanding the presence of his allies, Bana has all his thousand  arms cut off by Krishna except four. Siva advances to the aid of his  votary, when a combat ensues between the gods which combat Brahma  descends to arrest. The gods embrace one another. Parvati and Brahma  support Bana to make his submission.    Vishnu declares he is less sensible of the wounds inflicted by Bana,  than of the regret he feels at his presumption in contending with Siva.  The latter consoles him by telling him he only did a warrior's duty, and  that military prowess is independent of all motives of love or hatred.    Parvati then brings Usha to the spot, and by her desire, and that of  Siva, Bana gives his daughter to Aniruddha. Siva then elevates him to  the rank of one of his attendants, under the name of Mahakala.          SRIDAMA CHARITA.      Poverty and Folly are sent by Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, to assail  Sridama, the early companion and fellow-student of Krishna, who has  become obnoxious to the goddess for his attachment to Saraswati; the  goddess of learning. They effect their purpose with Sridama, by  demanding the rites of hospitality, and being accordingly admitted into  his dwelling.    Sridama is persuaded by his wife, Vasumati, who has seen a propitious  dream, to repair to Krishna, to see if his opulent friend will restore  his broken fortunes. He takes with him a handful of rice, dried and  cleaned after boiling, as a present. He arrives at the palace of  Krishna, where he is received with great respect by the host and his two  principal wives, Rukmini and Satyabhama; the former washes his feet, the  latter wipes them, and Krishna sprinkles the remaining water upon his  own head. After recalling some of the occurrences of their juvenile  days, when they were fellow-students, Krishna leads his friend into the  garden, where they remain till towards sunset; when they are summoned to  join the queens and their attendants. Krishna indulges in frolics among  his women. The buffoonery of the Vidushaka amuses the party.    After some time spent in this manner, Sridama takes his leave, and  although dismissed with great reverence, departs as poor as he came. He  recollects this on his way back, and consoles himself with observing  that wealth intoxicates as well as wine, and that the affection of  Krishna is a thing which no one can steal from him. His disciple is not  so submissive, and reminds him that it was not to get mere civility that  he was sent on this errand by his wife.    On arrival, they find, instead of the miserable hovel of Sridama, a  splendid and extensive town, and that Sridama is in great affliction at  the disappearance of his wife, when he is seen and solicited by a  _Kanchuli_ or chamberlain, who calls himself his servant, to enter a  stately palace. Sridama, thinking this is a jest upon his poverty,  threatens to beat him if he does not depart, but the chamberlain  perseveres, and tells him that while he was absent, Krishna had  converted his cottage into a town, named after him Sridamapur, and  supplied it with every article of use or luxury. With much reluctance  and unyielding incredulity Sridama is prevailed upon to enter the  palace, where he finds his wife.    Krishna now comes to pay a visit to his friend. He arrives in his aerial  chariot, accompanied by Satyabhama and the Vidushaka. His bounties are  heartily acknowledged by the object on whom they have been bestowed.          KANSA BADHA    OR    THE DESTRUCTION OF KANSA.      Kansa, the king of Mathura, alarmed by a voice from heaven, that  Krishna, the son of his sister, predestined to destroy him, has escaped  the precautions taken against him, consults with his minister what he  shall do.    The juvenile Krishna performs many exploits. He accomplishes the  destruction of the demon Kesi, one of those infernal beings who in vain  attempted to kill the divine child, instigated by their prescience of  their fate when he should reach maturity.    Akrura, the paternal uncle of Krishna, repairs to Gokul to invite his  nephew to Mathura. Balarama and Krishna, after bowing to their foster  parents, Nanda and Yasoda and receiving their benedictions, depart for  Mathura.    The seniors then express their grief for their loss. While the boys are  proceeding on their journey, they are overtaken by a messenger from  Radha, in consequence of which Krishna determines to spend some time at  Vrindavan. They resume their journey to Mathura. On the way, the youths  kill the royal elephant of Kansa. Then they defeat and slay Kansa's two  wrestlers Chanura and Mushtika. These occurrences are reported to Kansa.  The youths now reach his palace at Mathura and slay him. The boys are  then re-united with their mortal parents Vasudeva and Devaki. To console  Devaki for her brother's death, Krishna installs her father Ugrasena in  the sovereignty of Mathura.          YAYATI CHARITRA.      Sermishtha was the daughter of Vrishaperva, king of the Daityas, and  Devayani, the daughter of Sukra, regent of the planet Venus and the  spiritual preceptor of the Daitya race. Devayani having incurred the  displeasure of Sermishtha the latter threw the former into a well, where  she was found by king Yayati, the son of Nahusha. Devayani, on returning  to her father, excited his anger against Vrishaperva, who, to appease  Sukra, consented to give his daughter to Devayani as her servant, with a  thousand other female attendants. Devayani was married to Yayati. At the  time of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],[0,"The Story of a Summer (#12)"],[1,"of haying or harvesting time; but never, since I was old  enough to observe, can I recollect seeing her work in the fields.  Certainly mother was not a woman to hesitate to do cheerfully whatever  necessity required.  But she had quite enough to occupy herself at home  with the entire duties of a house, with the spinning, weaving, and  making up of all the linen and woollen cloth that the household used;  and the care and early instruction of her little ones--for it was her  pride that all of her children learned to read before going to school.  I remember that when I was first sent to school, at the age of four,  the teacher, with a glance at my tiny figure (for I was a small,  delicate child), called me up to read to her, and opened the book at  the alphabet.  Deeply injured, I informed her that I knew my letters,  and could read over in 'An old man found a rude boy in one of his  apple-trees,'--a fable that all familiar with Webster's Spelling-book  will remember.    \"My first distinct recollection of mother is in the dark days in New  Hampshire.  Father, as you know, had lost everything that he possessed,  and was obliged to fly into the next State to escape imprisonment for  debt.  After he left, his furniture was attached and sold.  I remember  seeing strange, rough men in the house, who pulled open all the trunks  and chests of drawers, and tossed about the beautiful bed and table  linen that mother had wrought before her marriage.  Another picture,  too, is impressed indelibly upon my mind--how mother followed the  sheriff and his men about from room to room with the tears rolling down  her face, while brother Horace, then a little white-haired boy, nine  years old, held her hand and tried to comfort her, telling her not to  cry--he would take care of her.    \"But mother, although humiliated and heart-sore at the poverty and  disgrace that lay before her so early in her married life, was not a  woman to fold her hands and think sadly of what      \"'--might have been.'    She wiped away her tears, and her busy fingers were soon preparing warm  hoods and dresses to protect her little ones from the bitter cold  during the journey that lay before us, for in the course of two or  three months father had by hard toil earned money sufficient to send  for us.  I remember very well that journey over the mountains covered  with snow into the State of Vermont, and our establishment in what was  called the 'small house by the ledge' in the little neighborhood of  houses clustering on and about the old Minot estate.    \"You children, accustomed as you have been from your infancy to the  attractive text-books of the present day, would quite scorn the system  of instruction at the school I attended in Westhaven.  I went there  three winters, but although I soon rose to the first class in reading  and spelling, in which branches I was unusually precocious, my  education was confined entirely to those two departments of learning.  Few text-books were then used in the school, for the parents of the  children were generally too poor to pay for many, and the musty old  Grammar and Arithmetic were kept in reserve for the older scholars.  On  account of my youth the teacher did not advance me, and I went again  and again through the old Spelling-book, and learnt by heart what was  called the 'fore part of the book'--some dry rules of orthography,  which never conveyed the slightest idea to my mind, although I repeated  them, parrot-like, without missing a word, and which the teacher never  thought of explaining to me.  From the spelling-book I was in time  promoted to the New Testament (not as easy reading as might have been  selected, by the way).  This was followed by the American Preceptor,  and subsequently by Murray's 'English Reader,' a work reserved for the  most advanced scholars.    \"My brothers did not go to school during the summer months, for their  services were then required to assist father in his work; and I, too,  had to leave school every day at eleven o'clock to carry their dinner  to them at the place, a mile and a half distant, where they were  clearing a portion of the Minot estate.    \"When brother Horace was thirteen years old he was taken out of school,  as the teacher could instruct him no longer.  I was kept at home also,  and brother taught me, giving me lessons in arithmetic and penmanship,  which studies had been prohibited me at school.  Here commenced a most  tender attachment and sympathy between brother and I.  As there were  two children--Barnes and sister Arminda--between us, our difference of  years had hitherto kept us somewhat apart; but after brother had been  for several months my instructor we were from that time the nearest in  heart in our large household.    \"I think that mother must have entirely regained her spirits during the  four years that we lived in Vermont, for I remember that men, women,  and children alike delighted in her society, and our house was the  centre of the little neighborhood.  We resided very near the  school-house, and rarely did a morning pass without a visit from some  of the girls, to have a few words of greeting from mother on their way  to their lessons.  When recess time came, they would arrive in numbers  to spend the time with her, and beg for a song or a story from the  inexhaustible supply with which her memory was stored, and there they  would remain, fascinated by her sweet, low voice until she would be  obliged to playfully chase them out of the house to compel them to  return to school.  From the teacher, for tardiness, punishment was a  very frequent occurrence, but it made slight impression upon the girls  in comparison with the enjoyment of listening to one of mother's  thrilling or romantic stories, for the following day they would return  to our house to again risk the penalty.    \"I told you that brother taught me after we were taken out of school.  He was the gentlest and kindest of instructors, and was always ready to  lay down his own book to help me out of any difficulty that my lesson  presented, although it was by no means easy to make him close his book  under other circumstances; such as the solicitations of his young  friends to join them in a game.    \"I have described father to you as a stern man in his every-day  intercourse with us, but although his motto was 'Work,' he was always  willing to grant us a holiday or a play-hour, when he thought we had  earned it.  He would relax his dignity, too, somewhat when young people  came to pass the evening with us; would encourage us to play games and  dance, and would often join us; for, although he never played cards  himself, nor would he allow them to be played in his house, he himself  taught us how to dance.    \"When our young friends came to see us, there was much rejoicing from  brother Barnes, who was full of life and spirits, and always ready to  play, and from Arminda and myself; but brother Horace, not at all  allured by blind-man's-buff or a dance, would retire to a corner with a  pine knot (for in those days candles were few), preferring the  companionship of his book to our merry games.  Coaxing was all in vain:  the only means of inducing him to join us was to snatch away his book  and hide it; but even then he preferred to gather us quietly about him  and tell us stories.  I remember that before he left home he had  related to us, among other things, the thousand and one stories of the  'Arabian Nights,' and 'Robinson Crusoe.'  This gift of story-telling he  inherited from mother, whose talent in that line certainly equalled  that of the beautiful Sultana Scheherazade herself.  At this time,  although I had never seen a copy of Shakespeare, I was familiar with  the names and plots of all his imaginative, and many of his historical  plays, which mother would relate to us in her own words, embellished  now and then with bits of the original verse, as she sat at her  spinning-wheel, or busied herself about the household work.    \"It was, I think, at this same time--our last year in Vermont--that a  large ball, for young people only, was given in our neighborhood.  Much  speculation was excited among our young friends as to whether Horace  would dance at this ball, and especially if he would fetch a partner  with him.  It was the general opinion that he would not, as he did not  bear a high reputation for gallantry.  Great, then, was the  astonishment of all present when Horace entered the ballroom with Anne  Bush, the prettiest girl in the neighborhood, upon his arm.  He opened  the ball with her, and his deportment quite silenced those who had  questioned his appearance.    \"Before long, preparations for another journey were in progress.  Father had earned money sufficient to buy some land, and I heard that  we were going to Pennsylvania.  I was, however, too young to be much  impressed by this news, and it was not until I saw mother once more in  tears that its importance was apparent to me.  This time mother wept as  bitterly as before, for not only was she to be separated by a greater  distance from her family in New Hampshire, to whom she was fondly  attached, and from the pleasant circle of friends she had made in  Westhaven, but her darling among us children, her beautiful eldest boy,  of whom she was so proud, was to be left in Vermont.\"          CHAPTER IX.
