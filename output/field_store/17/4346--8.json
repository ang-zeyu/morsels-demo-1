When I got on board, I learnt that, when the launch was on the west side of  the harbour taking in ballast, one of the men employed in this work, had  scalded his fingers in taking a stone up out of some water. This  circumstance produced the discovery of several hot springs, at the foot of  the cliff, and rather below high-water mark.    This day Mr Wales, and two or three of the officers advanced a little, for  the first time, into the island. They met with a small straggling village,  the inhabitants of which treated them with great civility; and the next  morning Mr Forster and his party made another excursion inland. They met  with several fine plantations of plantains, sugar-canes, yams, etc.; and the  natives were courteous and civil. Indeed, by this time, the people,  especially those in our neighbourhood, were so well reconciled to us, that  they shewed not the least dislike at our rambling about in the skirts of  the woods, shooting, etc. In the afternoon some boys having got behind  thickets, and having thrown two or three stones at our people who were  cutting wood, they were fired at by the petty officers present on duty.  Being ashore at that time, I was alarmed at hearing the report of the  musquets, and seeing two or three boys run out of the wood. When I knew the  cause I was much displeased at so wanton an use being made of our fire-arms,  and took measures to prevent it for the future. Wind southerly, with  heavy showers of rain.    During the night, and also all the 11th, the volcano was exceedingly  troublesome, and made a terrible noise, throwing up prodigious columns of  fire and smoke at each explosion, which happened every three or four  minutes; and, at one time, great stones were seen high in the air. Besides  the necessary work of wooding and watering, we struck the main-top-mast to  fix new trestle-trees and back-stays. Mr Forster and his party went up the  hill on the west side of the harbour, where he found three places from  whence smoke of a sulphureous smell issued, through cracks and fissures in  the earth. The ground about these was exceedingly hot, and parched or  burnt, and they seemed to keep pace with the volcano; for, at every  explosion of the latter, the quantity of smoke or steam in these was  greatly increased, and forced out so as to rise in small columns, which we  saw from the ship, and had taken for common fires made by the natives. At  the foot of this hill are the hot-springs before mentioned.    In the afternoon, Mr Forster having begun his botanical researches on the  other side of the harbour, fell in with our friend Paowang's house, where  he saw most of the articles I had given him, hanging on the adjoining trees  and bushes, as if they were not worthy of being under his roof.    On the 12th, some of the officers accompanied Mr Forster to the hot places  he had been at the preceding day. A thermometer placed in a little hole  made in one of them, rose from 80, at which it stood in the open air, to  170. Several other parts of the hill emitted smoke or steam all the day,  and the volcano was unusually furious, insomuch that the air was loaded  with its ashes. The rain which fell at this time was a compound of water,  sand, and earth; so that it properly might be called showers of mire.  Whichever way the wind was, we were plagued with the ashes; unless it blew  very strong indeed from the opposite direction. Notwithstanding the natives  seemed well enough satisfied with the few expeditions we had made in the  neighbourhood, they were unwilling we should extend them farther. As a  proof of this, some undertook to guide the gentlemen when they were in the  country, to a place where they might see the mouth of the volcano. They  very readily embraced the offer; and were conducted down to the harbour,  before they perceived the cheat.    The 13th, wind at N.E., gloomy weather. The only thing worthy of note this  day was, that Paowang being at dinner with us on board, I took the  opportunity to shew him several parts of the ship, and various articles, in  hopes of finding out something which they might value, and be induced to  take from us in exchange for refreshments; for what we got of this kind was  trifling. But he looked on every thing that was shewn him with the utmost  indifference; nor did he take notice of any one thing, except a wooden  sand-box, which he seemed to admire, and turned it two or three times over  in his hand.    Next morning after breakfast, a party of us set out for the country, to try  if we could not get a nearer and better view of the volcano. We went by the  way of one of those hot smoking places before mentioned, and dug a hole in  the hottest part, into which a thermometer of Fahrenheit's construction was  put; and the mercury presently rose to 100 deg.. It remained in the hole two  minutes and a half without either rising or falling. The earth about this  place was a kind of white clay, had a sulphureous smell, and was soft and  wet, the surface only excepted, over which was spread a thin dry crust,  that had upon it some sulphur, and a vitriolic substance, tasting like  alum. The place affected by the heat was not above eight or ten yards  square; and near it were some fig-trees, which spread their branches over  part of it, and seemed to like their situation. We thought that this  extraordinary heat was caused by the steam of boiling water, strongly  impregnated with sulphur. I was told that some of the other places were  larger than this; though we did not go out of the road to look at them, but  proceeded up the hill through a country so covered with trees, shrubs, and  plants, that the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees, which, seem to have been  planted here by nature, were, in a manner, choaked up. Here and there we  met with a house, some few people, and plantations. These latter we found  in different states, some of long standing, others lately cleared, and some  only clearing, and before any thing had been planted. The clearing of a  piece of ground for plantation, seemed to be a work of much labour,  considering the tools they had to work with, which, though much inferior to  those at the Society Isles, are of the same kind. Their method is, however,  judicious, and as expeditious as it can well be. They lop off the small  branches of the large trees, dig under the roots, and there burn the  branches and small shrubs and plants which they root up. The soil, in some  parts, is a rich black mould; in other parts, it seemed to be composed of  decayed vegetables, and of the ashes the volcano sends forth throughout all  its neighbourhood. Happening to turn out of the common path, we came into a  plantation where we found a man at work, who, either out of good-nature, or  to get us the sooner out of his territories, undertook to be our guide. We  followed him, accordingly, but had not gone far before we came to the  junction of two roads, in one of which stood another man with a sling and a  stone, which he thought proper to lay down when a musquet was pointed at  him. The attitude in which we found him, the ferocity appearing in his  looks, and his behaviour after, convinced us that he meant to defend the  path he stood in. He, in some measure, gained his point, for our guide took  the other road, and we followed, but not without suspecting he was leading  us out of the common way. The other man went with us likewise, counting us  several times over, and hallooing, as we judged, for assistance; for we  were presently joined by two or three more, among whom was a young woman  with a club in her hand. By these people we were conducted to the brow of a  hill, and shewn a road leading down to the harbour, which they wanted us to  take. Not choosing to comply, we returned to that we had left, which we  pursued alone, our guide refusing to go with us. After ascending another  ridge, as thickly covered with wood as those we had come over, we saw yet  other hills between us and the volcano, which seemed as far off as at our  first setting out. This discouraged us from proceeding farther, especially  as we could get no one to be our guide. We therefore came to a resolution  to return; and had but just put this in execution when we met between  twenty and thirty people, whom the fellow before mentioned had collected  together, with a design, as we judged, to oppose our advancing into the  country; but as they saw us returning they suffered us to pass unmolested.  Some of them put us into the right road, accompanied us down the hill, made  us stop by the way, to entertain us with cocoa-nuts, plantains, and  sugar-cane; and what we did not eat on the spot, they brought down the hill  with us. Thus we found these people hospitable, civil, and good-natured, when  not prompted to a contrary conduct by jealousy; a conduct I cannot tell how  to blame them for, especially when I considered the light in which they  must view us. It was impossible for them to know our real design; we enter  their ports without their daring to oppose; we endeavour to land in their  country as friends, and it is well if this succeeds; we land, nevertheless,  and maintain the footing we have got, by the superiority of our fire-arms.  Under such circumstances, what opinion are they to form of us? Is it not as  reasonable for them to think that we are come to invade their country, as  to pay them a friendly visit? Time, and some acquaintance with us, can only  convince them of the latter. These people are yet in a rude state; and, if  we may judge from circumstances and appearances, are frequently at war, not  only with their neighbours, but among themselves; consequently must be  jealous of every new face. I will allow there are some exceptions to this  rule to be found in this sea; but there are few nations who would willingly  suffer visitors like us to advance far into their country.

The writer has  seen as many as five snakes on the ground at once, some of them coiling  and rattling, others darting into the surrounding crowd with lightning  rapidity, but never has she seen one escape the gatherer, and just once  has she seen a snake come near to making its escape. This was during the  ceremony at Hotavilla last summer (1932); the spectators had crowded  rather close to the circle, and several front rows sat on the ground, in  order that the dozens of rows back of them might see over their heads.  As for the writer, she sat on a neighboring housetop, well out of the  way of rattlers, red racers, rabbit snakes, and even the harmless but  fearsome-looking bull snake from 3 to 5 feet long. Often the snake  starts swiftly for the side lines, but always without seeming haste the  gatherer gets it just as the startled spectators begin a hasty retreat.  If the snakes coils, meal is sprinkled on it and the feather wand  induces it to straighten, when it is picked up. But this time the big  snake really got into the crowd, second or third row, through space  hurriedly opened for him by the frightened and more or less squealing  white visitors. The priest was unable to follow it quickly without  stepping on people, who had repeatedly been warned not to sit too close.    [Illustration: Figure 11.--Snake Priests with Snake.    --Photo by Bortell]    Very quietly and without rising, a man in the third row picked up the  snake and handed it to the gatherer. The writer shuddered but did not  realize that the impromptu gatherer was her son, so bronzed by a  summer's archaeology field trip that she did not recognize him.  Afterward he merely said, \"It was a harmless bull snake, and the priest  couldn't reach it; it's a shame for visitors to crowd up and get in the  way unless they are prepared to sit perfectly still, whatever happens.\"  Really one feels ashamed of the squealing and frightened laughter of  careless white visitors who stand or sit nearer than they should and  then make an unseemly disturbance when a snake gets too close. The  priests resent such conduct, but always go right on without paying any  attention to it. The rattles and singing voices of the Antelope priests  furnish a dignified, rhythmic accompaniment throughout the dance, and  the Snake men move in perfect time to it.    When all the snakes have been carried and the last one has been dropped  from the mouth of the carrier, the chant ceases. A priest draws a great  round cloud symbol on the ground. Quickly the Hopi maids and women, (a  small selected group), who stand ready with baskets of meal, sprinkle  the ground within the circle. At a signal all the snakes, now in the  hands of the gatherers and the Antelope priests, are thrown upon this  emblem. The women hastily drop sacred meal on the mass of snakes, then a  second signal and the Snake priests grab up the whole writhing mass in  their hands and run in the four directions off the steep mesa, to  deposit their Elder Brothers again in the lowlands with the symbolic  sacred meal on their backs, that they may bear away to the underground  the prayers of their Younger Brothers, the Snake Clan. The Antelope  priests now circle the plaza four times, stamping on the sipapu in  passing, and then return to their own kiva, and the dance is over. The  Snake priests presently return to the village, still running, disrobe in  their kiva and promptly go to the nearest edge of the mesa, where the  women of their clan wait with huge bowls of emetic (promptly effective)  and tubs of water for bathing. This is the purification ceremony which  ends the ritual. Immediately the women of their families bring great  bowls and trays of food and place them on top of the Snake Kiva, and the  men, who have fasted all day and sometimes longer, enjoy a feast.    A spirit of relief and happiness now pervades the village and everybody  keeps open house.    Far more often than otherwise, rain, either a sprinkle or a downpour,  has come during or just at the close of the dance, and the people are  thankful and hopeful, for this is often the first rain of the season.  The writer has herself stood soaked to the skin by a thunder shower that  had been slowly gathering through the sultry afternoon and broke with  dramatic effect during the ceremony. The Snake priests were noticeably  affected by the incident and danced with actual fanatic frenzy.    Those who habitually attend this ceremony from Flagstaff and Winslow and  other points within motoring distance (if there is any motoring distance  these days) have long ago learned that they would better start for home  immediately following the dance, not waiting for morning, else the dry  washes may be running bank high by that time and prevent their getting  away.    The writer has counted more than a hundred marooned cars lined up at Old  Oraibi or Moencopi Wash, waiting, perhaps another twenty-four hours, for  the ordinarily dry wash to become fordable. One will at least be  impressed with the idea that the Snake Dance (a movable date set by the  priests from the observation of shadows on their sacred rocks) comes  just at the breaking of the summer drouth.    The writer has seen in the Snake Dance as many as nine groups of three,  all circling the plaza at once. But in recent years the number is  smaller, in some villages not more than four, for the old priests are  dying off and not every young man who inherits the priesthood upon the  death of his maternal uncle (priest) is willing to go on, though there  are some novices almost every year. This year (1932) the eleven year old  brother of a Hopi girl in the writer's employ went into his first snake  dance, as a gatherer, and his sister (a school girl since six) was as  solicitous as the writer whenever it was a rattler that Henry had to  gather up. But we both felt that we must keep perfectly still, so our  expressions of anxiety were confined to very low whispers. Henry was not  bitten and if he had been he would not have died. It is claimed and  generally believed that no priest has ever died from snake bite, and  indeed they are seldom bitten. During the past twenty years the writer  has twice seen a priest bitten by a rattler, once a very old priest and  once a boy of fourteen. No attention was paid, and apparently nothing  came of it.    Dr. Fewkes, Dr. Hough, and other authorities, in works already referred  to, assert that the fangs of the snakes are not removed, nor are the  snakes doped, nor \"treated\" in any way that could possibly render their  poison harmless. Nor is it believed that the Hopi have any antidote for  snake bite in their emetic or otherwise.    Does their belief make them fearless and likewise immune? Or are they  wise in their handling of the snakes, so that danger is reduced to the  vanishing point? No one knows.    The writer has made no attempt to go into the very numerous minute  details of this ceremony, such as the mixing of the liquid for snake  washing, the making of the elaborate sand painting for the Snake altar,  or descriptions of various kinds of prayer-sticks and their specific  uses. Authorities differ greatly on these points and each village uses  somewhat different paraphernalia and methods of procedure. These details  occupy hours and even days and are accompanied by much prayer and  ceremonial smoking, and the sincerity and solemnity of it all are most  impressive to any fair-minded observer.    The Hopi year is full of major and minor ceremonies, many of them as  deeply religious as those already described at some length; others of a  secular or social order, but even these are tinged with the religious  idea and invariably based on tradition.    If many elements of traditional significance have been forgotten, as  they undoubtedly have in some instances, nevertheless the thing is kept  going according to traditional procedure, and the majority of the  participants believe it best to keep up these time-honored rituals.  Their migration tales, partly mythical, partly historical, relate many  unhappy instances of famine, pestilence, and civil strife, which have  been brought upon various clans because of their having neglected their  old dances and ceremonies, and of relief and restored prosperity having  followed their resumption. Once, bad behavior brought on a flood.    Here is the story, and it will explain at least partially, the  ceremonial use of turkey feathers.      =A Flood and Turkey Feathers=    Turkey feathers are much prized for ceremonial uses today. If you want  to carry a little present to a Hopi friend, particularly an old man, or  an old woman, save up a collection of especially nice looking turkey  feathers. They will be put to ceremonial uses and bring blessings to  their owners.    Here is at least one of the legends back of the idea, as collected by  Stephen and reported by Mindeleff.[31] The chief of the water people  speaks:    \"In the long ago, the Snake, Horn, and Eagle people lived here (in  Tusayan), but their corn grew only a span high, and when they sang for  rain the cloud sent only a thin mist. My people then lived in the  distant Palatkiwabi in the South. There was a very bad old man there,  who, when he met anyone, would spit in his face, blow his nose upon him,  and rub ordure upon him. He ravished the girls and did all manner of  evil. (Note: Other variants of the legend say the young men were  mischievously unkind and cruel to the old men, rather than that an old  man was bad. H.G.L.) Baholikonga (big water serpent deity) got angry at  this and turned the world upside down, and water spouted up through the  kivas and through the fireplaces in the houses. The earth was rent in  great chasms, and water covered everything except one narrow ridge of  mud; and across this the serpent deity told all the people to travel. As  they journeyed across, the feet of the bad slipped "]]]
