[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#12)"],[1,"? or do you hope that the soft air of Italy will in time  restore a voice once ruined? I fall into a rage when I think of the many  beautiful voices which have been spoiled, and have dwindled away without  leaving a trace during the last forty years; and I vent my overflowing  heart in a brief notice of the many singing-teachers, whose rise and  influence I have watched for twenty years past.    The so-called singing-teachers whom we usually find, even in large  cities and in musical institutions, I exempt from any special criticism,  for they would not be able to understand my views. They permit soprano  voices to sing scales in all the five vowels at once; begin with _c_  instead of _f_; allow a long holding of the notes, \"in order to bring  out the voice,\" until the poor victim rolls her eyes and grows dizzy.  They talk only of the fine chest-tones which must be elicited, will have  nothing to do with the head-tones, will not even listen to them,  recognize them, or learn to distinguish them. Their highest principle  is: \"Fudge! we don't want any rubbish of Teschner, Miksch, and Wieck.  Sing in your own plain way: what is the use of this murmuring without  taking breath? For what do you have lungs if you are not to use them?  Come, try this aria: 'Grace,' 'grace!' Produce an effect! Down on your  knees!\"    There are again others who allow screaming,--\"the more the better,\"--in  order to produce power and expression in the voice, and to make it  serviceable for public performances. They may, indeed, require the  singing of _solfeggio_, and prattle about the requisite equality of the  tones; and they consequently make the pupil practise diligently and  strongly on the two-lined _a_, _b_ flat, _b_, where kind Nature does not  at first place the voice, because she has reserved for herself the slow  and careful development of it. As for the unfortunate gasping medium  voices, which are still less docile, and which sigh in the throat, and  after all can only speak, such teachers postpone the cultivation of  these to the future, or else they exclaim in a satisfied way, \"Now we  will sing at sight! Hit the notes! Let us have classical music!\" Of  these, also, I forbear to speak.    And as for the singing-teachers, whose business it is to educate the  voice for \"the opera of the future,\" I am really unable to write about  them. In the first place, I know nothing about \"the future,\" the unborn;  and, in the second place, I have more than enough to do with the  present.    And now I come to those who honestly wish to teach better, and who in a  measure do so. But even they are too pedantic: with prejudiced views,  they pursue one-sided aims. Without looking around to the right or to  the left or forwards, and without daily learning, reflecting, and  striving, they run in a groove, always ride their particular hobby, cut  every thing after one pattern, and use up the time in secondary matters,  in incredible trifles. For the formation of a fine tone, not a minute  should be lost, particularly with lady singers, who are not strong, and  usually cannot or ought not to sing more than twenty days in a month,  and who surely ought to be allowed to use their time in a reasonable  manner. Moreover, these are the teachers whom it is most difficult to  comprehend. Though they use only seven tones, they are plunged in  impenetrable mysteries, in incomprehensible knowledge and a multitude of  so-called secrets, out of which, indeed, nothing can ever be brought to  light. For this, however, they do not consider themselves to blame, not  even their hobby-horses; but, as they say, \"the higher powers.\" We will,  for once, suppose that three-fourths of the measures which they are  accustomed to employ in their treatment of the voice and of the  individual are good and correct (the same is true of many  piano-teachers); but the remaining fourth is sufficient to ruin the  voice, or to prevent its proper development, and therefore nothing  correct is to be gained. There are other teachers who never can get  beyond the formation of the tone, and are lost in the pursuit of  _perfection_,--that \"terrestrial valley of tears.\" Truly a beautiful  country, but which is only to be found in Paradise!    Others, instead of thinking, \"I will try for the present to do better  than others have done,\" so harass and torment the poor mortal voices  with their aim at perfect equality and perfect beauty of tone, the  result often is that every thing becomes unequal and far from beautiful.  Some teachers make their pupils so anxious and troubled that, owing to  their close attention to the tone, and the breath, and the  pronunciation, they sing their songs in an utterly wooden manner, and so  in fact they, too, are lost in optimism and in tears; whereas, for  singing, a happy confidence in the ability to succeed is essential.  Others pursue an opposite course, and are guilty of worse faults, as you  will see if you look around. Some of them have no standard of  perfection, but use up the time in an exchange of ideas with their  pupils, with mysterious and conceited \"ifs\" and \"buts.\" They are very  positive, but only within the narrow circle of their own ideas. They  make no advance in a correct medium path. Some allow pupils to practise  only _staccato_, and others only _legato_, aiming thereby at nobody  knows what. Some allow them to sing too loud, others too feebly; some  philosophize earnestly about beauty in the voice, and others grumble  about unpleasantness in the same; some are enthusiastic about  extraordinary talents, others fret about the want of talent; some have a  passion for making all the sopranos sing alto, others do just the  reverse; some prefer a shadowy, others a clear voice. They all rest  their opinions upon the authority of some famous screaming-master who  has written a singing-system. Upon like authority, some cultivate  chiefly the deep tones, because it is very fine, and \"creates an  effect,\" for soprano voices to be able suddenly to sing like men, or  rather to growl, and because it is the fashion in Paris. Others, on the  contrary, pride themselves upon the head-tones; but they are none of  them willing to pay much attention to the medium voices: that is too  critical and too delicate a matter, and requires too much trouble, for  the modern art of singing. As a last resort, they bethink themselves of  kind Nature, and lay the blame upon her.    Well, I will say no more upon this point, but will proceed. Have I not  already, in my piano instructions, insisted on the importance of a  gradual and careful use of every proper expedient to extend, strengthen,  beautify, and preserve the voice? I am thought, however, to infringe  upon the office of the singing-masters, who hold their position to be  much more exalted than that of the poor piano-teacher. Still, I must be  allowed to repeat that voices are much more easily injured than fingers;  and that broken, rigid voices are much worse than stiff, unmanageable  fingers, unless, after all, they amount to the same thing. I demand of  singing-teachers that they show themselves worthy of their position,  and allow no more voices to go to destruction, and that they give us  some satisfactory results. I believe in fact, in my homely simplicity,  that the whole thing may be accomplished without any mystery, without  trading in secrets or charlatanry; without the aid of modern anatomical  improvement, or rather destruction, of the worn-out throat, through  shortening or increasing the flexibility of the palate, through the  removal of the unnecessary glands or by attempts to lengthen the vocal  passage, or by remedying a great many other things in which Nature has  made a mistake, and on which special doctors for the voice, in Paris and  London, are now employed.    We supply the want of all these by the following little rule:--    Three trifles are essential for a good piano or singing-teacher,--        _The finest taste,      The deepest feeling,      The most delicate ear,_    and, in addition, the requisite knowledge, energy, and some practice.  _Voila tout!_ I cannot devote myself to the treatment of the throat, for  which I have neither time not fitness; and my lady singers are so busy  with the formation of true tone, and in attention to the care and  preservation of their voices, that they only wish to open their mouths  for that object, and not for anatomical purposes. In piano-playing also,  I require no cutting of the interdigital fold, no mechanical  hand-support, no accelerator for the fingers or stretching machine; and  not even the \"finger-rack\" invented and used, without my knowledge, by a  famous pupil[A] of mine, for the proper raising of the third and fourth  fingers.    My dear young lady, if the Creator has made the throat badly for  singing, he alone is responsible. I cannot come to his assistance by  destroying the throat with lunar caustic, and then reconstructing it. If  the throat is really worn out, may it not perhaps be owing to the  teacher, and to his mistaken management?    Nature does many things well, and before the introduction of this modern  fashion of singing produced many beautiful voices: has she all at once  become incapable of doing any thing right?    We will, then, simply return to the _three trifles_ above-mentioned;  and in these we will live and work \"with all our heart, with all our  soul, and with all our mind.\"    [A] Reference is here made to Robert Schumann, who, in order to  facilitate the use of the weaker fingers, employed a machine for raising  the fingers artificially, which resulted in loss of power over them, and  necessitated the abandonment of piano-playing.--_Tr._          CHAPTER IX.    THOUGHTS ON SINGING.      Our vocal composers, followed by many singing-teachers and singing  institutions, have almost banished from music the true art of singing;  or, at least, have introduced an unnatural, faulty, and always  disagreeable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16667"],[0,"Young Folks' History of Rome (#12)"],[1,"to obey a plebeian properly,  for in the course of the next twenty years it was necessary fourteen  times to appoint a Dictator for the defence of the state, so that it is  plain there must have been many alarms and much difficulty in enforcing  discipline; but, on the whole, success was with Rome, and the  neighboring tribes grew weaker.    [Illustration: CURTIUS LEAPING INTO THE GULF. (_From a Bas-Relief_.)]          CHAPTER XIV.    THE DEVOTION OF DECIUS.    B.C. 357      Other tribes of the Gauls did not fail to come again and make fresh  inroads on the valleys of the Tiber and Anio. Whenever they came,  instead of choosing men from the tribes to form an army, as in a war  with their neighbors, all the fighting men of the nation turned out to  oppose them, generally under a Dictator.    In one of these wars the Gauls came within three miles of Rome, and the  two hosts were encamped on the banks of the Anio, with a bridge between  them. Along this bridge strutted an enormous Gallic chief, much taller  than any of the Romans, boasting himself, and calling on any one of them  to come out and fight with him. Again it was a Manlius who  distinguished himself. Titus, a young man of that family, begged the  Dictator's permission to accept the challenge, and, having gained it, he  changed his round knight's shield for the square one of the foot  soldiers, and with his short sword came forward on the bridge. The Gaul  made a sweep at him with his broadsword, but, slipping within the guard,  Manlius stabbed the giant in two places, and as he fell cut off his  head, and took the torc, or broad twisted gold collar that was the mark  of all Gallic chieftains. Thence the brave youth was called Titus  Manlius Torquatus--a surname to make up for that of Capitolinus, which  had never been used again.    [Illustration: THE APENNINES.]    The next time the Gauls came, Marcus Valerius, a descendant of the old  hero Publicola, was consul, and gained a great victory. It was said that  in the midst of the fight a monstrous raven appeared flying over his  head, resting now and then on his helmet, but generally pecking at the  eyes of the Gauls and flapping its wings in their faces, so that they  fled discomfited. Thence he was called Corvus or Corvinus. The Gauls  never again came in such force, but a new enemy came against them,  namely, the Samnites, a people who dwelt to the south of them. They were  of Italian blood, mountaineers of the Southern Apennines, not unlike  the Romans in habits, language, and training, and the staunchest enemies  they had yet encountered. The war began from an entreaty from the people  of Campania to the Romans to defend them from the attacks of the  Samnites. For the Campanians, living in the rich plains, whose name is  still unchanged, were an idle, languid people, whom the stout men of  Samnium could easily overcome. The Romans took their part, and Valerius  Corvus gained a victory at Mount Gaurus; but the other consul, Cornelius  Cossus, fell into danger, having marched foolishly into a forest, shut  in by mountains, and with only one way out through a deep valley, which  was guarded by the Samnites. In this almost hopeless danger one of the  military tribunes, Publius Decius Mus, discovered a little hill above  the enemy's camp, and asked leave to lead a small body of men to seize  it, since he would be likely thus to draw off the Samnites, and while  they were destroying him, as he fully expected, the Romans could get out  of the valley. Hidden by the wood, he gained the hill, and there the  Samnites saw him, to their great amazement; and while they were  considering whether to attack him, the other Romans were able to march  out of the valley. Finding he was not attacked, Decius set guards, and,  when night came on, marched down again as quietly as possible to join  the army, who were now on the other side of the Samnite camp. Through  the midst of this he and his little camp went without alarm, until,  about half-way across, one Roman struck his foot against a shield. The  noise awoke the Samnites, but Decius caused his men to give a great  shout, and this, in the darkness, so confused the enemy that they missed  the little body of Romans, who safely gained their own camp. Decius cut  short the thanks and joy of the consul by advising him to fall at once  on the Samnite camp in its dismay, and this was done; the Samnites were  entirely routed, 30,000 killed, and their camp taken. Decius received  for his reward a hundred oxen, a white bull with gilded horns, and three  crowns--one of gold for courage, one of oak for having saved the lives  of his fellow-citizens, and one of grass for having taken the enemy's  camp--while all his men were for life to receive a double allowance of  corn. Decius offered up the white bull in sacrifice to Mars, and gave  the oxen to the companions of his glory.    Afterwards Valerius routed the Samnites again, and his troops brought in  120 standards and 40,000 shields which they had picked up, having been  thrown away by the enemy in their flight.    Peace was made for the time; but the Latins, now in alliance with Rome,  began to make war on the Samnites. They complained, and the Romans  feeling bound to take their part, a great Latin war began. Manlius  Torquatus and Decius Mus, the two greatest heroes of Rome, were consuls.  As the Latins and Romans were alike in dress, arms, and language, in  order to prevent taking friend for foe, strict orders were given that no  one should attack a Latin without orders, or go out of his rank, on pain  of death. A Latin champion came out boasting, as the two armies lay  beneath Mount Vesuvius, then a fair vine-clad hill showing no flame.  Young Manlius remembering his father's fame, darted out, fought hand to  hand with the Latin, slew him, and brought home his spoils to his  father's feet. He had forgotten that his father had only fought after  permission was given. The elder Manlius received him with stern grief.  He had broken the law of discipline, and he must die. His head was  struck off amid the grief and anger of the army. The battle was bravely  fought, but it went against the Romans at first. Then Decius,  recollecting a vision which had declared that a consul must devote  himself for his country, called on Valerius, the Pontifex Maximus, to  dedicate him. He took off his armor, put on his purple toga, covered his  head with a veil, and standing on a spear, repeated the words of  consecration after Valerius, then mounted his horse and rode in among  the Latins. They at first made way, but presently closed in and  overpowered him with a shower of darts; and thus he gave for his country  the life he had once offered for it.    The victory was won, and was so followed up that the Latins were forced  to yield to Rome. Some of the cities retained their own laws and  magistrates, but others had Romans with their families settled in them,  and were called colonies, while the Latin people themselves became Roman  citizens in everything but the power of becoming magistrates or voting  for them, being, in fact, very much what the earliest plebeians had been  before they acquired any rights.          CHAPTER XV.    THE SAMNITE WARS.      In the year 332, just when Alexander the Great was making his conquests  in the East, his uncle Alexander, king of Epirus, brother to his mother  Olympius, came to Italy, where there were so many Grecian citizens south  of the Samnites that the foot of Italy was called Magna Graecia, or  Greater Greece. He attacked the Samnites, and the Romans were not sorry  to see them weakened, and made an alliance with him. He stayed in Italy  about six years, and was then killed.    To overthrow the Samnites was the great object of Rome at this time, and  for this purpose they offered their protection and alliance to all the  cities that stood in dread of that people. One of the cities was founded  by men from the isle of Euboea, who called it Neapolis, or the New  City, to distinguish it from the old town near at hand, which they  called Palaeopolis, or the Old City. The elder city held out against the  Romans, but was easily overpowered, while the new one submitted to Rome;  but these southern people were very shallow and fickle, and little to be  depended on, as they often changed sides between the Romans and  Samnites. In the midst of the siege of Palaeopolis, the year of the  consulate came to an end, but the Senate, while causing two consuls as  usual to be elected, at home, would not recall Publilius Philo from the  siege, and therefore appointed him proconsul there. This was in 326, and  was the beginning of the custom of sending the ex-consul as proconsul to  command the armies or govern the provinces at a distance from home.    [Illustration: COMBAT BETWEEN A MIRMILLO AND A SAMNITE.]    [Illustration: COMBAT BETWEEN A LIGHT-ARMED GLADIATOR AND A SAMNITE.]    In 320, the consul falling sick, a dictator was appointed, Lucius  Papirius Cursor, one of the most stern and severe men in Rome. He was  obliged by some religious ceremony to return to Rome for a time, and he  forbade his lieutenant, Quintus Fabius Rullianus, to venture a battle in  his absence. But so good an opportunity offered that Fabius attacked the  enemy, beat them, and killed 20,000 men. Then selfishly unwilling to  have the spoils he had won carried in the dictator's triumph, he  burnt them all. Papirius arrived in great anger, and sentenced him to  death for his disobedience; but while the lictors were stripping him, he  contrived to escape from their hands among the soldiers, who closed on  him, so that he was able to get to Rome, where his father called the  Senate together, and they showed themselves so resolved to save his life  that Papirius was forced to pardon him, though not without reproaching  the Romans for having fallen from the stern justice of Brutus and  Manlius.
