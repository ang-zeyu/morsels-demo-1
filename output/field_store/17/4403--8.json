He had learned among the Indians how to shoot fish with bow and arrows,  and on this voyage across the Atlantic he occupied all his spare time in  sitting in the rigging and shooting the fish which disported themselves  about the vessel. These fish he sold to the officers, and we are told  that in this way he earned no less than five hundred crowns, perhaps  that many dollars. If this account is true, fish must have been very  costly in those days, but it showed plainly that if Roc had desired to  get into an honest business, he would have found fish-shooting a  profitable occupation. In every way Roc behaved so well that for his  sake all his men were treated kindly and allowed many privileges.    But when this party of reformed pirates reached Spain and were allowed  to go where they pleased, they thought no more of the oaths they had  taken to abandon piracy than they thought of the oaths which they had  been in the habit of throwing right and left when they had been  strolling about on the island of Jamaica. They had no ship, and not  enough money to buy one, but as soon as they could manage it they sailed  back to the West Indies, and eventually found themselves in Jamaica, as  bold and as bloody buccaneers as ever they had been.    Not only did Roc cast from him every thought of reformation and a  respectable life, but he determined to begin the business of piracy on a  grander scale than ever before. He made a compact with an old French  buccaneer, named Tributor, and with a large company of buccaneers he  actually set out to take a town. Having lost everything he possessed,  and having passed such a long time without any employment more  profitable than that of shooting fish with a bow and arrows, our doughty  pirate now desired to make a grand strike, and if he could take a town  and pillage it of everything valuable it contained, he would make a very  good fortune in a very short time, and might retire, if he chose, from  the active practice of his profession.    The town which Roc and Tributor determined to attack was Merida, in  Yucatan, and although this was a bold and rash undertaking, the two  pirates were bold and rash enough for anything. Roc had been a prisoner  in Merida, and on account of his knowledge of the town he believed that  he and his followers could land upon the coast, and then quietly advance  upon the town without their approach being discovered. If they could do  this, it would be an easy matter to rush upon the unsuspecting garrison,  and, having annihilated these, make themselves masters of the town.    But their plans did not work very well; they were discovered by some  Indians, after they had landed, who hurried to Merida and gave notice of  the approach of the buccaneers. Consequently, when Roc and his  companions reached the town they found the garrison prepared for them,  cannons loaded, and all the approaches guarded. Still the pirates did  not hesitate; they advanced fiercely to the attack just as they were  accustomed to do when they were boarding a Spanish vessel, but they soon  found that fighting on land was very different from fighting at sea. In  a marine combat it is seldom that a party of boarders is attacked in the  rear by the enemy, although on land such methods of warfare may always  be expected; but Roc and Tributor did not expect anything of the kind,  and they were, therefore, greatly dismayed when a party of horsemen from  the town, who had made a wide detour through the woods, suddenly charged  upon their rear. Between the guns of the garrison and the sabres of the  horsemen the buccaneers had a very hard time, and it was not long before  they were completely defeated. Tributor and a great many of the pirates  were killed or taken, and Roc, the Brazilian, had a terrible fall.    This most memorable fall occurred in the estimation of John Esquemeling,  who knew all about the attack on Merida, and who wrote the account of  it. But he had never expected to be called upon to record that his  great hero, Roc, the Brazilian, saved his life, after the utter defeat  of himself and his companions, by ignominiously running away. The loyal  chronicler had as firm a belief in the absolute inability of his hero to  fly from danger as was shown by the Scottish Douglas, when he stood, his  back against a mass of stone, and invited his enemies to \"Come one, come  all.\" The bushy-browed pirate of the drawn cutlass had so often  expressed his contempt for a soldier who would even surrender, to say  nothing of running away, that Esquemeling could scarcely believe that  Roc had retreated from his enemies, deserted his friends, and turned his  back upon the principles which he had always so truculently proclaimed.    But this downfall of a hero simply shows that Esquemeling, although he  was a member of the piratical body, and was proud to consider himself a  buccaneer, did not understand the true nature of a pirate. Under the  brutality, the cruelty, the dishonesty, and the recklessness of the  sea-robbers of those days, there was nearly always meanness and  cowardice. Roc, as we have said in the beginning of this sketch, was a  typical pirate; under certain circumstances he showed himself to have  all those brave and savage qualities which Esquemeling esteemed and  revered, and under other circumstances he showed those other qualities  which Esquemeling despised, but which are necessary to make up the true  character of a pirate.    The historian John seems to have been very much cut up by the manner in  which his favorite hero had rounded off his piratical career, and after  that he entirely dropped Roc from his chronicles.    This out-and-out pirate was afterwards living in Jamaica, and probably  engaged in new enterprises, but Esquemeling would have nothing more to  do with him nor with the history of his deeds.          Chapter XI    A Buccaneer Boom      The condition of affairs in the West Indies was becoming very serious in  the eyes of the Spanish rulers. They had discovered a new country, they  had taken possession of it, and they had found great wealth of various  kinds, of which they were very much in need. This wealth was being  carried to Spain as fast as it could be taken from the unfortunate  natives and gathered together for transportation, and everything would  have gone on very well indeed had it not been for the most culpable and  unwarranted interference of that lawless party of men, who might almost  be said to amount to a nationality, who were continually on the alert to  take from Spain everything she could take from America. The English,  French, and Dutch governments were generally at peace with Spain, but  they sat by quietly and saw their sailor subjects band themselves  together and make war upon Spanish commerce,--a very one-sided commerce,  it is true.    It was of no use for Spain to complain of the buccaneers to her sister  maritime nations. It is not certain that they could have done anything  to interfere with the operations of the sea-robbers who originally  sailed from their coasts, but it is certain they did not try to do  anything. Whatever was to be done, Spain must do herself. The pirates  were as slippery as they were savage, and although the Spaniards made a  regular naval war upon them, they seemed to increase rather than to  diminish. Every time that a Spanish merchantman was taken, and its gold  and silver and valuable goods carried off to Tortuga or Jamaica, and  divided among a lot of savage and rollicking fellows, the greater became  the enthusiasm among the Brethren of the Coast, and the wider spread the  buccaneering boom. More ships laden almost entirely with stalwart men,  well provided with arms, and very badly furnished with principles, came  from England and France, and the Spanish ships of war in the West Indies  found that they were confronted by what was, in many respects, a regular  naval force.    The buccaneers were afraid of nothing; they paid no attention to the  rules of war,--a little ship would attack a big one without the  slightest hesitation, and more than that, would generally take it,--and  in every way Spain was beginning to feel as if she were acting the part  of provider to the pirate seamen of every nation.    Finding that she could do nothing to diminish the number of the  buccaneering vessels, Spain determined that she would not have so many  richly laden ships of her own upon these dangerous seas; consequently, a  change was made in regard to the shipping of merchandise and the  valuable metals from America to her home ports. The cargoes were  concentrated, and what had previously been placed upon three ships was  crowded into the holds and between the decks of one great vessel, which  was so well armed and defended as to make it almost impossible for any  pirate ship to capture it. In some respects this plan worked very well,  although when the buccaneers did happen to pounce upon one of these  richly laden vessels, in such numbers and with such swift ferocity, that  they were able to capture it, they rejoiced over a prize far more  valuable than anything the pirate soul had ever dreamed of before. But  it was not often that one of these great ships was taken, and for a time  the results of Spanish robbery and cruelty were safely carried to Spain.    But it was very hard to get the better of the buccaneers; their lives  and their fortunes depended upon this boom, and if in one way they could  not get the gold out of the Spaniards, which the latter got out of the  natives, they would try another. When the miners in the gold fields find  they can no longer wash out with their pans a paying quantity of the  precious metal, they go to work on the rocks and break them into pieces  and crush them into dust; so, when the buccaneers found it did not pay  to devote themselves to capturing Spanish gold on its transit across the  ocean, many of them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#12)"],[1," instead of Carlyle,\" said Roger, \"I'd say  it was some publicity stunt pulled off by the publishers.  You know  they go to all manner of queer dodges to get an author's name in print.  But Carlyle's copyrights expired long ago, so I don't see the game.\"    \"I guess he's picketing your place to try and steal the formula for  eggs Samuel Butler,\" said Aubrey, and they both laughed.    \"You'd better come in and meet my wife and Miss Chapman,\" said Roger.  The young man made some feeble demur, but it was obvious to the  bookseller that he was vastly elated at the idea of making Miss  Chapman's acquaintance.    \"Here's a friend of mine,\" said Roger, ushering Aubrey into the little  room where Helen and Titania were still sitting by the fire.  \"Mrs.  Mifflin, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert, Miss Chapman, Mr. Gilbert.\"    Aubrey was vaguely aware of the rows of books, of the shining coals, of  the buxom hostess and the friendly terrier; but with the intense focus  of an intelligent young male mind these were all merely appurtenances  to the congenial spectacle of the employee.  How quickly a young man's  senses assemble and assimilate the data that are really relevant!  Without seeming even to look in that direction he had performed the  most amazing feat of lightning calculation known to the human  faculties.  He had added up all the young ladies of his acquaintance,  and found the sum total less than the girl before him.  He had  subtracted the new phenomenon from the universe as he knew it,  including the solar system and the advertising business, and found the  remainder a minus quantity.  He had multiplied the contents of his  intellect by a factor he had no reason to assume \"constant,\" and was  startled at what teachers call (I believe) the \"product.\"  And he had  divided what was in the left-hand armchair into his own career, and  found no room for a quotient.  All of which transpired in the length of  time necessary for Roger to push forward another chair.    With the politeness desirable in a well-bred youth, Aubrey's first  instinct was to make himself square with the hostess.  Resolutely he  occluded blue eyes, silk shirtwaist, and admirable chin from his mental  vision.    \"It's awfully good of you to let me come in,\" he said to Mrs. Mifflin.  \"I was here the other evening and Mr. Mifflin insisted on my staying to  supper with him.\"    \"I'm very glad to see you,\" said Helen.  \"Roger told me about you.  I  hope he didn't poison you with any of his outlandish dishes.  Wait till  he tries you with brandied peaches a la Harold Bell Wright.\"    Aubrey uttered some genial reassurance, still making the supreme  sacrifice of keeping his eyes away from where (he felt) they belonged.    \"Mr. Gilbert has just had a queer experience,\" said Roger.  \"Tell them  about it.\"    In the most reckless way, Aubrey permitted himself to be impaled upon a  direct and interested flash of blue lightning.  \"I was having dinner  with your father at the Octagon.\"    The high tension voltage of that bright blue current felt like ohm  sweet ohm, but Aubrey dared not risk too much of it at once.  Fearing  to blow out a fuse, he turned in panic to Mrs. Mifflin.  \"You see,\" he  explained, \"I write a good deal of Mr. Chapman's advertising for him.  We had an appointment to discuss some business matters.  We're planning  a big barrage on prunes.\"    \"Dad works much too hard, don't you think?\" said Titania.    Aubrey welcomed this as a pleasant avenue of discussion leading into  the parkland of Miss Chapman's family affairs; but Roger insisted on  his telling the story of the chef and the copy of Cromwell.    \"And he followed you here?\" exclaimed Titania.  \"What fun!  I had no  idea the book business was so exciting.\"    \"Better lock the door to-night, Roger,\" said Mrs. Mifflin, \"or he may  walk off with a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\"    \"Why, my dear,\" said Roger, \"I think this is grand news.  Here's a man,  in a humble walk of life, so keen about good books that he even pickets  a bookstore on the chance of swiping some.  It's the most encouraging  thing I've ever heard of.  I must write to the Publishers' Weekly about  it.\"    \"Well,\" said Aubrey, \"you mustn't let me interrupt your little party.\"    \"You're not interrupting,\" said Roger.  \"We were only reading aloud.  Do you know Dickens' Christmas Stories?\"    \"I'm afraid I don't.\"    \"Suppose we go on reading, shall we?\"    \"Please do.\"    \"Yes, do go on,\" said Titania.  \"Mr. Mifflin was just reading about a  most adorable head waiter in a London chop house.\"    Aubrey begged permission to light his pipe, and Roger picked up the  book.  \"But before we read the items of the coffee-room bill,\" he said,  \"I think it only right that we should have a little refreshment.  This  passage should never be read without something to accompany it.  My  dear, what do you say to a glass of sherry all round?\"    \"It is sad to have to confess it,\" said Mrs. Mifflin to Titania, \"Mr.  Mifflin can never read Dickens without having something to drink.  I  think the sale of Dickens will fall off terribly when prohibition comes  in.\"    \"I once took the trouble to compile a list of the amount of liquor  drunk in Dickens' works,\" said Roger, \"and I assure you the total was  astounding:  7,000 hogsheads, I believe it was.  Calculations of that  sort are great fun.  I have always intended to write a little essay on  the rainstorms in the stories of Robert Louis Stevenson.  You see R. L.  S. was a Scot, and well acquainted with wet weather.  Excuse me a  moment, I'll just run down cellar and get up a bottle.\"    Roger left the room, and they heard his steps passing down into the  cellar.  Bock, after the manner of dogs, followed him.  The smells of  cellars are a rare treat to dogs, especially ancient Brooklyn cellars  which have a cachet all their own.  The cellar of the Haunted Bookshop  was, to Bock, a fascinating place, illuminated by a warm glow from the  furnace, and piled high with split packing-cases which Roger used as  kindling.  From below came the rasp of a shovel among coal, and the  clear, musical slither as the lumps were thrown from the iron scoop  onto the fire.  Just then the bell rang in the shop.    \"Let me go,\" said Titania, jumping up.    \"Can't I?\" said Aubrey.    \"Nonsense!\" said Mrs. Mifflin, laying down her knitting.  \"Neither of  you knows anything about the stock.  Sit down and be comfortable.  I'll  be right back.\"    Aubrey and Titania looked at each other with a touch of embarrassment.    \"Your father sent you his--his kind regards,\" said Aubrey.  That was  not what he had intended to say, but somehow he could not utter the  word.  \"He said not to read all the books at once.\"    Titania laughed.  \"How funny that you should run into him just when you  were coming here.  He's a duck, isn't he?\"    \"Well, you see I only know him in a business way, but he certainly is a  corker.  He believes in advertising, too.\"    \"Are you crazy about books?\"    \"Why, I never really had very much to do with them.  I'm afraid you'll  think I'm terribly ignorant----\"    \"Not at all.  I'm awfully glad to meet someone who doesn't think it's a  crime not to have read all the books there are.\"    \"This is a queer kind of place, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, it's a funny idea to call it the Haunted Bookshop.  I wonder what  it means.\"    \"Mr. Mifflin told me it meant haunted by the ghosts of great  literature.  I hope they won't annoy you.  The ghost of Thomas Carlyle  seems to be pretty active.\"    \"I'm not afraid of ghosts,\" said Titania.    Aubrey gazed at the fire.  He wanted to say that he intended from now  on to do a little haunting on his own account but he did not know just  how to break it gently.  And then Roger returned from the cellar with  the bottle of sherry.  As he was uncorking it, they heard the shop door  close, and Mrs. Mifflin came in.    \"Well, Roger,\" she said; \"if you think so much of your old Cromwell,  you'd better keep it in here.  Here it is.\"  She laid the book on the  table.    \"For the love of Mike!\" exclaimed Roger.  \"Who brought it back?\"    \"I guess it was your friend the assistant chef,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"Anyway, he had a beard like a Christmas tree.  He was mighty polite.  He said he was terribly absent minded, and that the other day he was in  here looking at some books and just walked off with it without knowing  what he was doing.  He offered to pay for the trouble he had caused,  but of course I wouldn't let him.  I asked if he wanted to see you, but  he said he was in a hurry.\"    \"I'm almost disappointed,\" said Roger.  \"I thought that I had turned up  a real booklover.  Here we are, all hands drink the health of Mr.  Thomas Carlyle.\"    The toast was drunk, and they settled themselves in their chairs.    \"And here's to the new employee,\" said Helen.  This also was  dispatched, Aubrey draining his glass with a zeal which did not escape  Miss Chapman's discerning eye.  Roger then put out his hand for the  Dickens.  But first he picked up his beloved Cromwell.  He looked at it  carefully, and then held the volume close to the light.    \"The mystery's not over yet,\" he said.  \"It's been rebound.  This isn't  the original binding.\"    \"Are you sure?\" said Helen in surprise.  \"It looks the same.\"    \"The binding has been cleverly imitated, but it can't fool me.  In the  first place, there was a rubbed corner at the top; and there was an ink  stain on one of the end papers.\"    \"There's still a stain there,\" said Aubrey, looking over his shoulder.    \"Yes, but not the same stain.  I've had that book long enough to know  it by heart.  Now what the deuce would that lunatic want to have it  rebound for?\"    \"Goodness gracious,\" said Helen, \"put it away and forget about it.  We'll all be dreaming about Carlyle if you're not careful.\"        Chapter V    Aubrey Walks Part Way Home--and Rides The Rest of the Way      It was a cold, clear night as Mr. Aubrey Gilbert left the Haunted"]]]
