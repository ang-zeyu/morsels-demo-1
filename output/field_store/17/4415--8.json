The divine  character of Amenothes, ascribed to him on account of his solar origin  and the co-operation of Amon-Ra at his birth, was, owing to this  separation of the funerary constituents, brought into further  prominence. When once the body which he had animated while on earth  was removed and hidden from sight, the people soon became accustomed  to think only of his Double enthroned in the recesses of the sanctuary:  seeing him receive there the same honours as the gods themselves, they  came naturally to regard him as a deity himself.    [Illustration: 073.jpg THE TWO COLOSSI OF MEMNON IN THE PLAIN OF THEBES]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato. The       \"Vocal Statue of Memon\" is that on the right-hand side of       the illustration.    The arrangement of his temple differed in no way from those in which  Amon, Maut, and Montu were worshipped, while it surpassed in size and  splendour most of the sanctuaries dedicated to the patron gods of the  chief towns of the nomes. It contained, moreover, colossal statues,  objects which are never found associated with the heavenly gods. Several  of these figures have been broken to pieces, and only a few scattered  fragments of them remain, but two of them still maintain their positions  on each side of the entrance, with their faces towards the east. They  are each formed of a single block of red breccia from Syene,* and are  fifty-three feet high, but the more northerly one was shattered in the  earthquake which completed the ruin of Thebes in the year 27 B.C. The  upper part toppled over with the shock, and was dashed to pieces on the  floor of the court, while the lower half remained in its place. Soon  after the disaster it began to be rumoured that sounds like those  produced by the breaking of a harp-string proceeded from the pedestal at  sunrise, whereupon travellers flocked to witness the miracle, and legend  soon began to take possession of the giant who spoke in this marvellous  way. In vain did the Egyptians of the neighbourhood declare that the  statue represented the Pharaoh Amenothes; the Greeks refused to believe  them, and forthwith recognised in the colossus an image of Memnon the  Ethiopian, son of Tithonus and Aurora, slain by their own Achilles  beneath the walls of Troy--maintaining that the music heard every  morning was the clear and harmonious voice of the hero saluting his  mother.         * It is often asserted that they are made of rose granite,       but Jollois and Devilliers describe them as being of \"a       species of sandstone breccia, composed of a mass of agate       flint, conglomerated together by a remarkably hard cement.       This material, being very dense and of a heterogeneous       composition, presents to the sculptor perhaps greater       difficulties than even granite.\"    Towards the middle of the second century of our era, Hadrian undertook a  journey to Upper Egypt, and heard the wonderful song; sixty years later,  Septimus Severus restored the statue by the employment of courses of  stones, which were so arranged as to form a rough representation of a  human head and shoulders. His piety, however, was not rewarded as he  expected, for Memnon became silent, and his oracle fell into oblivion.  The temple no longer exists, and a few ridges alone mark the spot where  it rose; but the two colossi remain at their post, in the same condition  in which they were left by the Roman Caesar: the features are quite  obliterated, and the legs and the supporting female figures on either  side are scored all over with Greek and Latin inscriptions expressing  the appreciation of ancient tourists. Although the statues tower high  above the fields of corn and _bersim_ which surround them, our first  view of them, owing to the scale of proportion observed in their  construction, so different from that to which we are accustomed, gives  us the impression that they are smaller than they really are, and it  is only when we stand close to one of them and notice the insignificant  appearance of the crowd of sightseers clustered on its pedestal that we  realize the immensity of the colossi.    The descendants of Ahmosis had by their energy won for Thebes not only  the supremacy over the peoples of Egypt and of the known world, but had  also secured for the Theban deities pre-eminence over all their rivals.  The booty collected both in Syria and Ethiopia went to enrich the god  Amon as much as it did the kings themselves; every victory brought him  the tenth part of the spoil gathered on the field of battle, of the  tribute levied on vassals, and of the prisoners taken as slaves. When  Thutmosis IIL, after having reduced Megiddo, organised a systematic  plundering of the surrounding country, it was for the benefit of Amon-Ea  that he reaped the fields and sent their harvest into Egypt; if during  his journeys he collected useful plants or rare animals, it was that he  might dispose of them in the groves or gardens of Amon as well as in his  own, and he never retained for his personal use the whole of what he won  by arms, but always reserved some portion for the sacred treasury.    [Illustration: 076.jpg A PARTY OF TOURISTS AT THE FOOT OF THE VOCAL  STATUE OF MEMNOK]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Insinger.    His successors acted in a similar manner, and in the reigns of Amenothes  II., Thut-mosis IV., and Amenothes III., the patrimony of the Theban  priesthood continued to increase. The Pharaohs, perpetually called upon  as they were to recompense one or other of their servants, were never  able to retain for long their share of the spoils of war. Gold and  silver, lands, jewels, and slaves passed as quickly out of their hands  as they had fallen into them, and although then fortune was continually  having additions made to it in every fresh campaign, yet the increase  was rarely in proportion to the trouble expended. The god, on the  contrary, received what he got for all time, and gave back nothing in  return: fresh accumulations of precious metals were continually being  added to his store, his meadows were enriched by the addition of  vineyards, and with his palm forests he combined fish-ponds full of  fish; he added farms and villages to those he already possessed, and  each reign saw the list of his possessions increase. He had his own  labourers, his own tradespeople, his own fishermen, soldiers, and  scribes, and, presiding over all these, a learned hierarchy of divines,  priests, and prophets, who administered everything. This immense domain,  which was a kind of State within the State, was ruled over by a single  high priest, chosen by the sovereign from among the prophets. He was the  irresponsible head of it, and his spiritual ambition had increased  step by step with the extension of his material resources. As the human  Pharaoh showed himself entitled to homage from the lords of the earth,  the priests came at length to the conclusion that Amon had a right  to the allegiance of the lords of heaven, and that he was the Supreme  Being, in respect of whom the others were of little or no account, and  as he was the only god who was everywhere victorious, he came at length  to be regarded by them as the only god in existence. It was impossible  that the kings could see this rapid development of sacerdotal power  without anxiety, and with all their devotion to the patron of their  city, solicitude for their own authority compelled them to seek  elsewhere for another divinity, whose influence might in some degree  counterbalance that of Amon. The only one who could vie with him at  Thebes, either for the antiquity of his worship or for the rank which he  occupied in the public esteem, was the Sun-lord of Heliopolis, head of  the first Ennead. Thutmosis IV. owed his crown to him, and 'displayed  his gratitude in clearing away the sand from the Sphinx, in which  the spirit of Harmakhis was considered to dwell; and Amenothes  III., although claiming to be the son of Amon himself, inherited the  disposition shown by Thutmosis in favour of the Heliopolitan religions,  but instead of attaching himself to the forms most venerated by  theologians, he bestowed his affection on a more popular deity--Atonu,  the fiery disk. He may have been influenced in his choice by private  reasons. Like his predecessors, he had taken, while still very young,  wives from among his own family, but neither these reasonable ties, nor  his numerous diplomatic alliances with foreign princesses, were enough  for him. From the very beginning of his reign he had loved a maiden who  was not of the blood of the Pharaohs, Tii, the daughter of Iuia and his  wife Tuia.*    * For the last thirty years Queen Tii has been the subject of many  hypotheses and of much confusion. The scarabasi engraved under Amenothes  III. say explicitly that she was the daughter of two personages, Iuia  and Tuia, but these names are not accompanied by any of the signs which  are characteristic of foreign names, and were considered Egyptian by  contemporaries. Hincks was the first who seems to have believed her  to be a Syrian; he compares her father's name with that of Levi, and  attributes the religious revolution which followed to the influence of  her foreign education. This theory has continued to predominate; some  prefer a Libyan origin to the Asiatic one, and latterly there has  been an attempt to recognise in Tii one of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#12)"],[1,"ties; if he did not actually make the plans for the  hypostyle hall at Karnak, he appears at least to have superintended  its execution and decoration. He finished the great pylon, erected the  obelisks and gateways, built the _bari_ or vessel of the god, and found  a further field for his activity on the opposite bank of the Nile, where  he helped to complete both the chapel at Qurneh and also the Ramesseum.  Ramses II. had always been able to make his authority felt by the high  priests who succeeded Baukuni-khonsu, but the Pharaohs who followed him  did not hold the reins with such a strong hand. As early as the reigns  of Minephtah and Seti II. the first prophets, Rai and Rama, claimed the  right of building at Karnak for their own purposes, and inscribed on the  walls long inscriptions in which their own panegyrics took precedence  of that of the sovereign; they even aspired to a religious hegemony, and  declared themselves to be the \"chief of all the prophets of the gods  of the South and North.\" We do not know what became of them during the  usurpation of Arisu, but Nakhtu-ramses, son of Miribastit, who filled  the office during the reign of Ramses III., revived these ambitious  projects as soon as the state of Egypt appeared to favour them. The  king, however pious he might be, was not inclined to yield up any of his  authority, even though it were to the earthly delegate of the divinity  whom he reverenced before all others; the sons of the Pharaoh were,  however, more accommodating, and Nakhtu-ramses played his part so well  that he succeeded in obtaining from them the reversion of the high  priesthood for his son Amenothes. The priestly office, from having been  elective, was by this stroke suddenly made hereditary in the family.  The kings preserved, it is true, the privilege of confirming the new  appointment, and the nominee was not considered properly qualified until  he had received his investiture from the sovereign.*         * This is proved by the Maunier stele, now in the Louvre; it       is there related how the high priest Manakh-pirri received       his investiture from the Tanite king.    Practically the Pharaohs lost the power of choosing one among the sons  of the deceased pontiff; they were forced to enthrone the eldest of his  survivors, and legalise his accession by their approbation, even when  they would have preferred another. It was thus that a dynasty of vassal  High Priests came to be established at Thebes side by side with the  royal dynasty of the Pharaohs.    The new priestly dynasty was not long in making its power felt in  Thebes. Nakhtu-ramses and Amenothes lived to a great age--from the reign  of Ramses III. to that of Ramses X., at the least; they witnessed the  accession of nine successive Pharaohs, and the unusual length of their  pontificates no doubt increased the already extraordinary prestige which  they enjoyed throughout the length and breadth of Egypt. It seemed as if  the god delighted to prolong the lives of his representatives beyond the  ordinary limits, while shortening those of the temporal sovereigns. When  the reigns of the Pharaohs began once more to reach their normal length,  the authority of Amenothes had become so firmly established that no  human power could withstand it, and the later Ramessides were merely a  set of puppet kings who were ruled by him and his successors. Not only  was there a cessation of foreign expeditions, but the Delta, Memphis,  and Ethiopia were alike neglected, and the only activity displayed  by these Pharaohs, as far as we can gather from their monuments, was  confined to the service of Amon and Khonsu at Thebes. The lack of energy  and independence in these sovereigns may not, however, be altogether  attributable to their feebleness of character; it is possible that they  would gladly have entered on a career of conquest had they possessed  the means. It is always a perilous matter to allow the resources of  a country to fall into the hands of a priesthood, and to place its  military forces at the same time in the hands of the chief religious  authority. The warrior Pharaohs had always had at their disposal the  spoils obtained from foreign nations to make up the deficit which their  constant gifts to the temples were making in the treasury. The sons  of Ramses III., on the other hand, had suspended all military efforts,  without, however, lessening their lavish gifts to the gods, and they  must, in the absence of the spoils of war, have drawn to a considerable  extent upon the ordinary resources of the country; their successors  therefore found the treasury impoverished, and they would have been  entirely at a loss for money had they attempted to renew the campaigns  or continue the architectural work of their forefathers. The priests of  Amon had not as yet suffered materially from this diminution of revenue,  for they possessed property throughout the length and breadth of Egypt,  but they were obliged to restrict their expenditure, and employ the sums  formerly used for the enlarging of the temples on the maintenance  of their own body. Meanwhile public works had been almost everywhere  suspended; administrative discipline became relaxed, and disturbances,  with which the police were unable to cope, were increasing in all the  important towns. Nothing is more indicative of the state to which Egypt  was reduced, under the combined influence of the priesthood and the  Ramessides, than the thefts and pillaging of which the Theban necropolis  was then the daily scene. The robbers no longer confined themselves  to plundering the tombs of private persons; they attacked the royal  burying-places, and their depredations were carried on for years before  they were discovered. In the reign of Ramses IX., an inquiry, set on  foot by Amenothes, revealed the fact that the tomb of Sovkumsauf I. and  his wife, Queen Nubk-has, had been rifled, that those of Amenothes I.  and of Antuf IV. had been entered by tunnelling, and that some dozen  other royal tombs in the cemetery of Drah abu'l Neggah were threatened.*         * The principal part of this inquiry constitutes the _Abbott       Papyrus_, acquired and published by the British Museum,       first examined and made the subject of study by Birch,       translated simultaneously into French by Maspero and by       Chabas, into German by Lauth and by Erman. Other papyri       relate to the same or similar occurrences, such as the Salt       and Amherst Papyri published by Chabas, and also the       Liverpool Papyri, of which we possess merely scattered       notices in the writings of Goodwin, and particularly in       those of Spiegelberg.    The severe means taken to suppress the evil were not, however,  successful; the pillagings soon began afresh, and the reigns of the last  three Ramessides between the robbers and the authorities, were marked by  a struggle in which the latter did not always come off triumphant.    [Illustration: 089.jpg RAMSES IX.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Lepsius.    A system of repeated inspections secured the valley of Biban el-Moluk  from marauders,* but elsewhere the measures of defence employed were  unavailing, and the necropolis was given over to pillage, although both  Amenothes and Hrihor had used every effort to protect it.         * Graffiti which are evidences of these inspections have       been drawn on the walls of several royal tombs by the       inspectors. Others have been found on several of the coffins       discovered at Deir el-Bahari, e.g. on those of Seti I. and       Ramses II.; the most ancient belong to the pontificate of       Hrihor, others belong to the XXIst dynasty.    Hrihor appears to have succeeded immediately after Amenothes, and  his accession to the pontificate gave his family a still more exalted  position in the country. As his wife Nozmit was of royal blood, he  assumed titles and functions to which his father and grandfather  had made no claim. He became the \"Royal Son\" of Ethiopia and  commander-in-chief of the national and foreign troops; he engraved his  name upon the monuments he decorated, side by side with that of Ramses  XII.; in short, he possessed all the characteristics of a Pharaoh except  the crown and the royal protocol. A century scarcely had elapsed since  the abdication of Ramses III., and now Thebes and the whole of Egypt  owned two masters: one the embodiment of the ancient line, but a mere  nominal king; the other the representative of Amon, and the actual ruler  of the country.    What then happened when the last Ramses who bore the kingly title was  gathered to his fathers? The royal lists record the accession after his  death of a new dynasty of Tanitic origin, whose founder was Nsbindidi  or Smendes; but, on the other hand, we gather from the Theban monuments  that the crown was seized by Hrihor, who reigned over the southern  provinces contemporaneously with Smendes. Hrihor boldly assumed as  prenomen his title of \"First Prophet of Amon,\" and his authority was  acknowledged by Ethiopia, over which he was viceroy, as well as by the  nomes forming the temporal domain of the high priests. The latter had  acquired gradually, either by marriage or inheritance, fresh territory  for the god, in the lands of the princes of Nekhabit, Kop-tos, Akhmim,  and Abydos, besides the domains of some half-dozen feudal houses  who, from force of circumstances, had become sacerdotal families; the  extinction of the direct line of Ramessides now secured the High  Priests the possession of Thebes itself, and of all the lands within the  southern provinces which were the appanage of the crown.
