Slowly--fearing that too much  interest manifested might excite suspicion--he replied: \"I think I  should.\" Deliberately looking around amongst all the \"freight,\" he  discovered the box, and said, \"I think that is it there.\" Said officer  stepped to it, looked at the directions on it, then at the bill of  lading, and said, \"That is right, take it along.\" Here the interest in  these two bosoms was thrilling in the highest degree. But the size of  the box was too large for the carriage, and the driver refused to take  it. Nearly an hour and a half was spent in looking for a furniture car.  Finally one was procured, and again the box was laid hold of by the  occupant's particular friend, when, to his dread alarm, the poor fellow  within gave a sudden cough. At this startling circumstance he dropped  the box; equally as quick, although dreadfully frightened, and, as if  helped by some invisible agency, he commenced singing, \"Hush, my babe,  lie still and slumber,\" with the most apparent indifference, at the same  time slowly making his way from the box. Soon his fears subsided, and it  was presumed that no one was any the wiser on account of the accident,  or coughing. Thus, after summoning courage, he laid hold of the box a  third time, and the Rubicon was passed. The car driver, totally ignorant  of the contents of the box, drove to the number to which he was directed  to take it--left it and went about his business. Now is a moment of  intense interest--now of inexpressible delight. The box is opened, the  straw removed, and the poor fellow is loosed; and is rejoicing, I will  venture to say, as mortal never did rejoice, who had not been in similar  peril. This particular friend was scarcely less overjoyed, however, and  their joy did not abate for several hours; nor was it confined to  themselves, for two invited members of the Vigilance Committee also  partook of a full share. This box man was named Wm. Jones. He was boxed  up in Baltimore by the friend who received him at the wharf, who did not  come in the boat with him, but came in the cars and met him at the  wharf.    The trial in the box lasted just seventeen hours before victory was  achieved. Jones was well cared for by the Vigilance Committee and sent  on his way rejoicing, feeling that Resolution, Underground Rail Road,  and Liberty were invaluable.    On his way to Canada, he stopped at Albany, and the subjoined letter  gives his view of things from that stand-point--          MR. STILL:--I take this opportunity of writing a few lines to      you hoping that tha may find you in good health and femaly. i am      well at present and doing well at present i am now in a store      and getting sixteen dollars a month at the present. i feel very      much o blige to you and your family for your kindnes to me while      i was with you i have got a long without any trub le a tal. i am      now in albany City. give my lov to mrs and mr miller and tel      them i am very much a blige to them for there kind ns. give my      lov to my Brother nore Jones tel him i should like to here from      him very much and he must write. tel him to give my love to all      of my perticnlar frends and tel them i should like to see them      very much. tel him that he must come to see me for i want to see      him for sum thing very perticler. please ansure this letter as      soon as posabul and excuse me for not writting sooner as i don't      write myself. no more at the present.

W.

[Footnote A: Shot by slave-hunters.]    In setting out for freedom, Wesley was the leader of this party. After  two nights of fatiguing travel at a distance of about sixty miles from  home, the young aspirants for liberty were betrayed, and in an attempt  made to capture them a most bloody conflict ensued. Both fugitives and  pursuers were the recipients of severe wounds from gun shots, and other  weapons used in the contest.    Wesley bravely used his fire arms until almost fatally wounded by one of  the pursuers, who with a heavily loaded gun discharged the contents with  deadly aim in his left arm, which raked the flesh from the bone for a  space of about six inches in length. One of Wesley's companions also  fought heroically and only yielded when badly wounded and quite  overpowered. The two younger (brothers of C. Matterson) it seemed made  no resistance.    In order to recall the adventures of this struggle, and the success of  Wesley Harris, it is only necessary to copy the report as then penned  from the lips of this young hero, while on the Underground Rail Road,  even then in a very critical state. Most fearful indeed was his  condition when he was brought to the Vigilance Committee in this City.    UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORD.    _November 2d_, 1853.--Arrived: Robert Jackson (shot man), _alias_ Wesley  Harris; age twenty-two years; dark color; medium height, and of slender  stature.    Robert was born in Martinsburg, Va., and was owned by Philip Pendleton.  From a boy he had always been hired out. At the first of this year he  commenced services with Mrs. Carroll, proprietress of the United States  Hotel at Harper's Ferry. Of Mrs. Carroll he speaks in very grateful  terms, saying that she was kind to him and all the servants, and  promised them their freedom at her death. She excused herself for not  giving them their freedom on the ground that her husband died insolvent,  leaving her the responsibility of settling his debts.    But while Mrs. Carroll was very kind to her servants, her manager was  equally as cruel. About a month before Wesley left, the overseer, for  some trifling cause, attempted to flog him, but was resisted, and  himself flogged. This resistance of the slave was regarded by the  overseer as an unpardonable offence; consequently he communicated the  intelligence to his owner, which had the desired effect on his mind as  appeared from his answer to the overseer, which was nothing less than  instructions that if he should again attempt to correct Wesley and he  should repel the wholesome treatment, the overseer was to put him in  prison and sell him. Whether he offended again or not, the following  Christmas he was to be sold without fail.    Wesley's mistress was kind enough to apprise him of the intention of his  owner and the overseer, and told him that if he could help himself he  had better do so. So from that time Wesley began to contemplate how he  should escape the doom which had been planned for him.    \"A friend,\" says he, \"by the name of C. Matterson, told me that he was  going off. Then I told him of my master's writing to Mrs. Carroll  concerning selling, etc., and that I was going off too. We then  concluded to go together. There were two others--brothers of  Matterson--who were told of our plan to escape, and readily joined with  us in the undertaking. So one Saturday night, at twelve o'clock, we set  out for the North. After traveling upwards of two days and over sixty  miles, we found ourselves unexpectedly in Terrytown, Md. There we were  informed by a friendly colored man of the danger we were in and of the  bad character of the place towards colored people, especially those who  were escaping to freedom; and he advised us to hide as quickly as we  could. We at once went to the woods and hid. Soon after we had secreted  ourselves a man came near by and commenced splitting wood, or rails,  which alarmed us. We then moved to another hiding-place in a thicket  near a farmer's barn, where we were soon startled again by a dog  approaching and barking at us. The attention of the owner of the dog was  drawn to his barking and to where we were. The owner of the dog was a  farmer. He asked us where we were going. We replied to Gettysburg--to  visit some relatives, etc. He told us that we were running off. He then  offered friendly advice, talked like a Quaker, and urged us to go with  him to his barn for protection. After much persuasion, we consented to  go with him.    \"Soon after putting us in his barn, himself and daughter prepared us a  nice breakfast, which cheered our spirits, as we were hungry. For this  kindness we paid him one dollar. He next told us to hide on the mow till  eve, when he would safely direct us on our road to Gettysburg. All, very  much fatigued from traveling, fell asleep, excepting myself; I could not  sleep; I felt as if all was not right.    \"About noon men were heard talking around the barn. I woke my companions  up and told them that that man had betrayed us. At first they did not  believe me. In a moment afterwards the barn door was opened, and in came  the men, eight in number. One of the men asked the owner of the barn if  he had any long straw. 'Yes,' was the answer. So up on the mow came  three of the men, when, to their great surprise, as they pretended, we  were discovered. The question was then asked the owner of the barn by  one of the men, if he harbored runaway negroes in his barn? He answered,  'No,' and pretended to be entirely ignorant of their being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],[0,"Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#12)"],[1," there.    But I wish you could have seen the tricks Percival did. He jumped through  between Uncle Wiggily's long ears, and he walked on his hind legs, and on  his front ones. Then he stood on his head, and he made believe he was  begging for something to eat, and Uncle Wiggily fed him a carrot, and a  piece of pie. Then he put a piece of bread on his nose, tossed it up into  the air--tossed the bread, I mean, not his nose--and when it came down he  caught it and ate it. Oh, it was great!    Well, those wolves were too surprised for anything. They had never seen  tricks like those. First they smiled a bit. Then they smiled some more.  Then one laughed, then the other laughed, and finally, when Uncle Wiggily  and Percival took turns jumping over each other's backs, the wolves  thought it so funny that they had to lie down on the leaves and roll over  and over because they were laughing so hard.    And, of course, after that they didn't feel like hurting Uncle Wiggily or  Percival. And just then the big alligator came along and chased the wolves  away, so the rabbit and dog had no one to bother them except the  alligator, and, as he had just had his supper, he wasn't hungry, so he  didn't eat them.    So Uncle Wiggily and Percival went to sleep, and so must you, and if the  vegetable man brings me a pumpkin Jack o' Lantern, with a pink ribbon on  the end of the stem, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily  in a well.          STORY XVII    UNCLE WIGGILY IN A WELL      Well, I didn't get the pumpkin Jack o' Lantern with the pink ribbon on,  but some one mailed me an ice cream cone, so it's just as well. That is, I  suppose it was an ice cream cone when it started on its journey, but when  I got it there was only the cone part left. Maybe the postman took out the  ice cream, with which to stick a stamp on the letter.    But there, I must tell you what happened to Uncle Wiggily after he and  Percival did those tricks, and made the wolves laugh so hard. The rabbit  and the circus dog stayed in the woods all that night, and nothing  bothered them.    \"Now, Percival, you make the coffee, and I'll spread the bread and butter  for breakfast,\" said Uncle Wiggily the next morning.    \"Where are you going to get the bread and butter?\" asked the dog.    \"Oh, I have it in my satchel,\" spoke the old rabbit, and, surely enough,  he did have several large, fine slices. So he and Percival ate their  breakfast, and then they started off again.    They hadn't gone very far before they met a grasshopper, who was limping  along on top of a fence rail, and looking quite sad--I mean the  grasshopper was looking sad, not the fence rail.    \"What is the matter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, kindly. \"Are you sad and  lonesome because you can't have some cherry pie, or some bread and butter;  or because you can't see any funny tricks? If you are, don't worry, Mr.  Grasshopper, for Percival and I can give you something to eat, and also do  some tricks to make you laugh.\"    \"No, I am not sad about any of those things,\" replied the grasshopper,  \"but you see I gave a big jump over a large stone a little while ago, and  I sprained my left hind leg. Now I can't jump any more, and here it is  Summer, and, of course, we grasshoppers have to hop, or we don't make any  money.\"    \"Oh, don't let a little thing like that worry you,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily.  \"I have some very nice salve, that a gentleman and his boy gave me when  their automobile ran over me, and it cured my sore toe, so I think it will  cure your left hind leg.\"    Then he put some salve on the grasshopper's leg, and in a little while it  was much better.    \"Now we must travel on again, to seek our fortune,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Come, Percival.\"    \"I will just do one little trick, to make the grasshopper feel better  before we leave,\" said the circus dog, so he stood up on the end of his  tail, and went around and around, and winked first one eye and then the  other, it was too funny for anything, really it was.    Well, the alligator laughed at that--oh there I go again--I mean the  grasshopper laughed, and then Uncle Wiggily and Percival went off  together, very glad indeed that they had had a chance to do a kindness,  even to a grasshopper.    Pretty soon they came to a place where there were two roads branching off,  one to the right hand and the other to the left, like the letter \"Y.\"    \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Percival, \"you go to the right, Uncle  Wiggily, and I'll go to the left, and, later on, we'll meet by the mill  pond, and perhaps each of us may have found his fortune by that time.\"    \"Good!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"We'll do it!\"    So he went off one way, and the circus dog took the other path through the  woods, and now I must tell you what happened to the old gentleman rabbit.    Uncle Wiggily went along for some time, and just as he got to a place  where there was a large stone, all of a sudden out popped a big fat toad.  And it wasn't a nice toad, either, but a bad toad.    \"Hello, Uncle Wiggily,\" said the squatty-watty toad. \"I haven't seen you  in some time. I guess you must be getting pretty old. You can't jump as  good as you once could, can you?\"    \"Of course, I can,\" exclaimed the rabbit, a bit pettish-like, for he  didn't care to have even a toad think he couldn't jump as well as ever he  could.    \"I'd like to see you,\" went on the toad. \"See if you jump from here over  on that pile of leaves,\" and he pointed to them with his warty toes.    \"I'll do it,\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. So he laid aside his crutch and his  valise, gave a little run and a big jump, and then he came down kerthump  on the pile of leaves.    But wait. Oh! I have something sad to tell you. That toad was only playing  a trick on the rabbit, and those leaves were right over a big, deep, dark  well. And as soon as Uncle Wiggily landed on the leaves he fell through,  for there were no boards under them to cover up the well, and down, down,  down he went, and if there had been water in the well he would have been  drowned. But the well was dry, I'm glad to say. Still Uncle Wiggily had a  great fall--almost like the tumble of Humpty-Dumpty.    \"Ah, ha!\" exclaimed the mean, squatty-squirmy toad. \"Now you are in the  well, and I'm going off, and tell the wolves, so they can come and get  you out, and eat you. Ah, ha!\" Oh! but wasn't that toad a most unpleasant  one? You see, he used to work for the wolves, doing all sorts of mean  things for them, and trapping all the animals he could for them.    So off the toad hopped, to call the wolves to come and get Uncle Wiggily,  and the poor rabbit was left alone at the bottom of the well. He tried his  best to get up, but he couldn't.    \"I guess I'll have to stay here until the wolves come,\" he thought, sadly.  \"But I'll call for help, and see what happens.\" So he called: \"Help! Help!  Help!\" as loudly as he could.    And all of a sudden a voice answered and asked:    \"Where are you?\"    \"In the well,\" shouted Uncle Wiggily, and he was afraid it was the wolves  coming to eat him. But it wasn't, it was the limpy grasshopper, and he  tried to pull Uncle Wiggily out of the well, but, of course, he wasn't  strong enough.    \"But I'll get Percival, the circus dog, and he'll pull you out before the  wolves come,\" said the grasshopper. \"Now I have a chance to do you a  kindness for the one you did me.\" So he hopped off, as his leg was nearly  all better, and he found Percival on the left road and told him what had  happened.    And, my! how that circus dog did rush back to help Uncle Wiggily. And he  got him out of the well in no time, by lowering a long rope to him, and  pulling the rabbit gentleman up, and then the rabbit and dog ran away,  before the toad could come back with the savage wolves, who didn't get any  supper out of the well, after all, and it served them right.    So that's all of this story, but I have some more, about the adventures of  Uncle Wiggily, and next, in case the load of hay doesn't fall on my  puppy-dog, and break off his curly tail, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily  and Jennie Chipmunk.          STORY XVIII    UNCLE WIGGILY AND JENNIE CHIPMUNK      After Uncle Wiggily had been pulled up out of the well by Percival, the  old circus dog, and they had run far enough off so that the wolves  couldn't get them, the rabbit and the grasshopper and Percival sat down on  the ground to rest. For you see Uncle Wiggily was tired from having fallen  down the well, and the grasshopper was tired from having run so fast to  call back Percival, and of course Percival was tired from having pulled up  the old gentleman rabbit. So they were all pretty well tired out.    \"I'm sure I can't thank you enough for what you did for me,\" said Uncle  Wiggily to Percival, and the grasshopper. \"And as a little treat I'm going  to give you some cherry pie that I made for the hedgehog.\"    So they ate some cherry pie, and then they felt better. And they were just  going to travel on together again, when, all at once, there was a rustling  in the bushes, and out flew Dickie Chip-Chip, the sparrow boy.    \"Oh, my\" cried Uncle Wiggily, wrinkling up his nose. \"At first I thought  you were a savage owl.\"    \"Oh, no, I'm not an owl,\" said Dickie. \"But I'm in a great hurry, and  perhaps I made a noise like an owl. Percival, you must come back home to  the Bow Wow house right away.\"    \"Why?\" asked Percival, sticking up his two ears so that he could hear  better.    \"Because Peetie Bow Wow is very ill with the German measles, and he wants  to see you do some of your funny circus tricks,\" spoke Dickie. \"He thinks  that will make him better.\"    \"Ha! I've no doubt that it will!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"If I were not  traveling about, seeking my fortune, I'd go back with you, Percival. I  love Peetie Bow Wow, and Jackie, too.\"    \"Oh, I'll go,\" said the grasshopper. \"I will play Peetie a funny fiddle  tune, on my left hind leg, and that may make"]]]
