I have already suggested that Giotto's types  were so massive because such figures most easily convey values of touch.  Michelangelo tended to similar exaggerations, to making shoulders, for  instance, too broad and too bossy, simply because they make thus a more  powerful appeal to the tactile imagination. Indeed, I venture to go even  farther, and suggest that his faults in all the arts, sculpture no less  than painting, and architecture no less than sculpture, are due to this  self-same predilection for salient projections. But the lover of the  figure arts for what in them is genuinely artistic and not merely  ethical, will in Michelangelo, even at his worst, get such pleasures as,  excepting a few, others, even at their best, rarely give him.           *       *       *       *       *    [Page heading: CONSTANT AIMS OF FLORENTINE ART]    In closing, let us note what results clearly even from this brief  account of the Florentine school, namely that, although no Florentine  merely took up and continued a predecessor's work, nevertheless all,  from first to last, fought for the same cause. There is no opposition  between Giotto and Michelangelo. The best energies of the first, of the  last, and of all the intervening great Florentine artists were  persistently devoted to the rendering of tactile values, or of movement,  or of both. Now successful grappling with problems of form and of  movement is at the bottom of all the higher arts; and because of this  fact, Florentine painting, despite its many faults, is, after Greek  sculpture, the most serious figure art in existence.          INDEX TO THE WORKS OF THE PRINCIPAL FLORENTINE PAINTERS.      NOTE.    The following lists make no claim to absolute completeness, but no  genuine work by the painters mentioned, found in the better known public  or private collections, has been omitted. With the exception of three or  four pictures, which he knows only in the photographs, the author has  seen and carefully studied every picture indicated, and is alone  responsible for the attributions, although he is happy to acknowledge  his indebtedness to the writings of Signor Cavalcaselle, of the late  Giovanni Morelli, of Signor Gustavo Frizzoni, and of Dr. J. P. Richter.  For the convenience of students, lists of the sculptures, but the more  important only, have been appended to the lists of pictures by those  artists who have left sculptures as well as paintings.    Public galleries are mentioned first, then private collections, and  churches last. The principal public gallery is always understood after  the simple mention of a city or town. Thus, Paris means Paris, Louvre,  London means London, National Gallery, etc.    An interrogation point after the title of a picture indicates that its  attribution to the given painter is doubtful. Distinctly early or late  works are marked E. or L.    It need scarcely be said that the attributions here given are not based  on official catalogues, and are often at variance with them.

Bert had his books and other things, and under them was hidden a real  bank book, showing that there had been deposited to his credit ten  dollars in the Lakeport Savings Bank. Nan had a similar bank book, and  of these the twins were very, very proud. Bert felt as if he was truly  getting to be quite a business man.    \"Oh! oh!\" cried Nan, as she opened a big box that was at the bottom of  her pile of presents, and then the tears of joy stood in her eyes as she  brought forth the hoped-for set of furs. They were beautiful, and so  soft she could not resist brushing them against her cheek over and over  again.    \"Oh, mamma, I think they are too lovely for anything!\" she said, rushing  up and kissing her parent. \"I am sure no girl ever had such a nice set  of furs before!\"    \"You must try to keep them nice, Nan,\" answered the mother.    \"I shall take the very best of care of them,\" said Nan, and my readers  may be sure that she did.    \"And now we have something for you, too,\" said Bert, and brought out the  various articles. Flossie gave their mamma her present, and Freddie gave  papa what was coming to him. Then Nan gave Dinah the fancy apron and  Bert took Sam the new gloves.    \"Well this is truly a surprise!\" cried Mr. Bobbsey, as he inspected the  cravat. \"It is just what I need.\"    \"And this flower is beautiful,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey as she smelt of the  potted plant. \"It will bloom a long while, I am sure.\"    Dinah was tickled over the apron and Sam with his gloves.    \"Yo' chillun am the sweetest in de world,\" said the cook.    \"Dem globes am de werry t'ing I needed to keep ma hands warm,\" came from  Sam.    It was fully an hour before the children felt like sitting down to  breakfast. Before they began the repast Mr. Bobbsey brought forth the  family Bible and read the wonderful story of Christ's birth to them, and  asked the blessing. All were almost too excited to eat.    After breakfast all must go out and show their presents to their friends  and see what the friends had received. It was truly a happy time. Then  all went coasting until lunch.    \"The expressman is coming!\" cried Bert a little later, and sure enough  he drove up to the Bobbsey house with two boxes. One was from their  Uncle Daniel Bobbsey, who lived at Meadow Brook, and the other from  their Uncle William Minturn, who lived at Ocean Cliff.    \"More presents!\" cried Nan, and she was right. Uncles and aunts had sent  each something; and the twins were made happier than ever.    \"Oh, but Christmas is just the best day in the whole year,\" said Bert  that evening, after the eventful day was over.    \"Wish Christmas would come ev'ry week,\" said Freddie. \"Wouldn't it be  _beau_tiful?\"    \"If it did I'm afraid the presents wouldn't reach,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey,  and then took him and Flossie off to bed.          CHAPTER XV    THE CHILDREN'S PARTY      The little black kitten that Freddie had brought home from the  department store was a great friend to everybody in the Bobbsey house  and all loved the little creature very much.    At first Freddie started to call the kitten Blackie, but Flossie said  that wasn't a very \"'ristocratic\" name at all.    \"I'll tell you what,\" said Bert jokingly, \"Let's call him Snoop,\" and in  spite of all efforts to make the name something else Snoop the cat  remained from that time to the day of his death.    He grew very fat and just a trifle lazy, nevertheless he learned to do  several tricks. He could sit up in a corner on his hind legs, and shake  hands, and when told to do so would jump through one's arms, even if the  arms were quite high up from the floor.    Snoop had one comical trick that always made both Flossie and Freddie  laugh. There was running water in the kitchen, and Snoop loved to sit on  the edge of the sink and play with the drops as they fell from the  bottom of the faucet. He would watch until a drop was just falling, then  reach out with his paw and give it a claw just as if he was reaching for  a mouse.    Another trick he had, but this Mrs. Bobbsey did not think so nice, was  to curl himself on the pillow of one of the beds and go sound asleep.  Whenever he heard Mrs. Bobbsey coming up one pair of stairs, he would  fly off the bed and sneak down the other pair, so that she caught him  but rarely.    Snoop was a very clean cat and was continually washing his face and his  ears. Around his neck Flossie placed a blue ribbon, and it was amusing  to see Snoop try to wash it off. But after a while, having spoilt  several ribbons, he found they would not wash off, and so he let them  alone, and in the end appeared very proud of them.    One day, when Snoop had been in the house but a few months, he could  not be found anywhere.    \"Snoop! Snoop!\" called Freddie, upstairs and down, but the kitten did  not answer, nor did he show himself. Then Flossie called him and made a  search, but was equally unsuccessful.    \"Perhaps somebody has stolen him,\" said Freddie soberly.    \"Nobody been heah to steal dat kitten,\" answered Dinah. \"He's jess  sneaked off, dat's all.\"    All of the children had been invited to a party that afternoon and Nan  was going to wear her new set of furs. After having her hair brushed,  and putting on a white dress, Nan went to the closet in which her furs  were kept in the big box.    \"Well, I never!\" she ejaculated. \"Oh, Snoop! however could you do it!\"    For there, curled up on the set of furs, was the kitten, purring as  contentedly as could be. Never before had he found a bed so soft or so  to his liking. But Nan made him rouse up in a hurry, and after that when  she closed the closet she made quite sure that Snoop was not inside.    The party to be held that afternoon was at the home of Grace Lavine, the  little girl who had fainted from so much rope jumping. Grace was over  that attack, and was now quite certain that when her mamma told her to  do a thing or to leave it alone, it was always for her own good.    \"Mamma knows best,\" she said to Nan. \"I didn't think so then, but I do  now.\"    The party was a grand affair and over thirty young people were present,  all dressed in their best. They played all sorts of games such as many  of my readers must already know, and then some new games which the big  boys and girls introduced.    One game was called Hunt the Beans. A handful of dried beans was hidden  all over the rooms, in out-of-the-way corners, behind the piano, in  vases, and like that, and at the signal to start every girl and boy  started to pick up as many as could be found. The search lasted just  five minutes, and at the end of that time the one having the most beans  won the game.    \"Now let us play Three-word Letters,\" said Nan. And then she explained  the game. \"I will call out a letter and you must try to think of a  sentence of three words, each word starting with that letter. Now then,  are you ready?\"    \"Yes! yes!\" the girls and boys cried.    \"B,\" said Nan.    There was a second of silence.    \"Boston Baked Beans!\" shouted Charley Mason.    \"That is right, Charley. Now it is your turn to give a letter.\"    \"F,\" said Charley.    \"Five Fat Fairies!\" cried Nellie Parks.    \"Four Fresh Fish,\" put in another of the girls.    \"Nellie has it,\" said Charley. \"But I never heard of fat fairies, did  you?\" and this question made everybody laugh.    \"My letter is M,\" said Nellie, after a pause.    \"More Minced Mushrooms,\" said Bert.    \"More Mean Men,\" said another boy.    \"Mind My Mule,\" said one of the girls.    [Illustration: AT SEVEN O'CLOCK A SUPPER WAS SERVED.--P. 129.]    \"Oh, Helen, I didn't know you had a mule,\" cried Flossie, and this  caused a wild shriek of laughter.    \"Bert must love mushrooms,\" said Nellie.    \"I do,\" said Bert, \"if they are in a sauce.\" And then the game went on,  until somebody suggested something else.    At seven o'clock a supper was served. The tables were two in number,  with the little girls and boys at one and the big girls and boys at the  other. Each was decked out with flowers and with colored streamers,  which ran down from the chandelier to each corner of both tables.    There was a host of good things to eat and drink--chicken sandwiches and  cake, with cups of sweet chocolate, or lemonade, and then more cake and  ice-cream, and fruit, nuts, and candy. The ice-cream was done up into  various fancy forms, and Freddie got a fireman, with a trumpet under his  arm, and Nan a Japanese lady with a real paper parasol over her head.  Bert was served with an automobile, and Flossie cried with delight when  she received a brown-and-white cow that looked as natural as life. All  of the forms were so pleasing that the children did not care to eat  them until the heat in the lighted dining room made them begin to melt  away.    \"I'm going to tell Dinah about the ice-cream cow,\" said Flossie.  \"Perhaps she can make them.\" But when appealed to, the cook said they  were beyond her, and must be purchased from the professional ice-cream  maker, who had the necessary forms.    There were dishes full of bonbons on the tables, and soon the bonbons  were snapping at a lively rate among the big girls and boys, although  the younger folks were rather afraid of them. Each bonbon had a motto  paper in it and some sort of fancy article made of paper. Bert got an  apron, which he promptly pinned on, much to the amusement of the girls.  Nan drew a workman's cap and put it on, and this caused another laugh.  There were all sorts of caps, hats, and aprons, and one big bonbon,  which went to Flossie, had a complete dress in it, of pink and white  paper. Another had some artificial flowers, and still another a tiny  bottle of cologne.    While the supper was going on, Mr. Lavine had darkened the parlor and  stretched a sheet over the folding doors, and as soon as the young  people were through eating they were treated to a magic-lantern  exhibition by the gentleman of the house and one of the big boys, who"]]]
