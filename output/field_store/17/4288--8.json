The body, with that of the Peshwa's son, received the  usual honours of Hindu cremation at the prayer of the Nawab  Shujaa. Several pretenders to the name of this Oriental Sebastian  afterwards appeared from time to time; the last was in captivity  in 1782, when Warren Hastings procured his liberation.    After these things the allies moved to Dehli; but the Daurani  troops became mutinous and quarrelsome; and they parted on ill  terms. Shujaa marched back to Mahdi Ghat, whence he had come six  months before, with the titular appointment of Vazir of the  Empire. The Shah, having written to the fugitive Shah Alam, to  salute him as emperor, got what money he could out of the  exhausted treasury and departed to his own country. Najib Khan  remained at Dehli under the title of Najib-ud-daulah, with a son  of the absent emperor as ostensible regent. Having made these  dispositions, Ahmad the Abdali returned to his own country, and  only once again interposed actively in the affairs of the Indian  peninsula.    Such was the famous Campaign of Panipat, the first disaster, on a  great scale, of the power of the Mahratta confederacy, and the  besom which swept the land of Hindustan for the advent of the  British.    It appears that, at this period, the Shahzada had applied to  Colonel Clive for an Asylum in Calcutta, while the Colonel was at  the same time in receipt of a letter from the minister at Dehli   the unscrupulous Ghazi-ud-din  calling on him to arrest the  prince as a rebel and forward him to Court in custody. Clive  contented himself by sending him a small present in money. About  the same time, however, Clive wrote to Lord Chatham (then Prime  Minister, and Mr. Pitt), recommending the issue of orders  sanctioning his demanding the Viceroyship of the Eastern Subahs  on behalf of the King of England; an application which he  guaranteed the Emperor's granting on being assured of the  punctual payment of fifty lakhs a year, the estimated fifth of  the revenues. \"This,\" he says, \"has of late been very ill-paid,  owing to the distractions in the heart of the Moghul Empire,  which have prevented the Court from attending to their concerns  in those distant provinces.\" Although nothing came of these  proceedings, they are here noted as the presage of future events.      PART II.        CHAPTER I.    The English  Shujaa-ud-daulah  Shahzada enters Bihar; his  character  Ramnarayan defeated  M. Law  Battle of Gaya  March  towards Hindustan  Massacre of Patna  Flight of Kasim and Sumro   Battle of Buxar  Treaty with British  Text of Treaty   Establishment at Allahabad  Emperor's establishment   Authorities cited  Broome's Bengal Army  Legal position.    THE events related in the foregoing introductory chapters had led  to a complete obscuration of the Timuride family and power.  Whether or no that dynasty was to resume its sway once more  depended entirely on the turn that events were to take at this  crisis; and chiefly on what might happen in the eastern provinces  of Bihar and Bengal, where a new power was rapidly making itself  felt. To that quarter, therefore, general attention was  henceforth drawn; and the new power  the English  began to be,  by common consent, treated as arbiter of the future. The Nawab of  Audh was also an important element in the problem, as it then  appeared; and the return of the ruler of Kabul to the plains  where he had so lately struck a blow that seemed decisive, was a  matter of almost daily expectation.    1759.  When in 1759 the heir to what was left of the empire of  Hindostan had gallantly cut his way through the myrmidons sent  against him by the ruthless Minister, he crossed the Jamna and  took refuge with Najib-ud-daulah, the Afghan, who was then at  Saharanpur in the Fifty-Two Parganas. But finding that noble  unable to afford him material support, and still fearing the  machinations of his enemy, he gradually retired to Lucknow,  intending perhaps to wait there until the return of the Abdali  leader might afford him an opportunity of turning upon the  Mohamadan and Hindu rebels.    The present viceroy of Audh was Shujaa-ud-daulah, the son of the  famous Safdar Jang, whom he equalled in ability, and far exceeded  in soldierly qualities. On his first succession to his father's  now almost independent fief he was young, and content with the  unbounded indulgence of those bodily faculties with which he was  largely endowed. He is described as extremely handsome, and above  the average stature; with an acute mind, somewhat too volatile;  and more prone by nature to the exercises of the field than to  the deliberations of the cabinet. But neither was the son of  Safdar Jang likely to be brought up wholly without lessons in  that base and tortuous selfishness which, in the East even more  than elsewhere, usually passes for statecraft; nor were those  lessons likely to be read in ears unprepared to understand them.  Shujaa's conduct in the late Rohilla war had been far from frank;  and he was particularly unwilling to throw himself irredeemably  into the cause of a ruined sovereign's fugitive heir. Foiled in  his application to the Viceroy of Audh, the Shahzada (Prince)  then turned to a member of the same family who held the Fort and  District of Allahabad, and was named Mohammad Kuli Khan. To this  officer he exhibited an imperial patent in his own name for the  lieutenancy of Bahar, Bengal, and Orissa, which were then the  theatre of wars between the British traders of Calcutta and the  family of the usurping Viceroy of those Subahs, Aliverdi Khan.  The Prince proposed to Mohammad Kuli that they should raise the  Imperial standard and reduce both competitors to their proper  level. The governor, a man of ambition and spirit, was warmly  encouraged to this scheme by his relation, the Viceroy of Audh  (for reasons of his own, which we shall speedily discover, Shujaa  highly approved of the arrangement); and a powerful official,  named Kamgar Khan, promised assistance in Bihar. Thus supported,  the Prince crossed the frontier stream (Karamnassa) in November,  1759, just at the time that his unfortunate father lost his life  in the manner related above. (Part I. chapter v.)    1760.  In the distracted state of the country it was more than a  month before the news of this tragedy arrived in camp, which was  then pitched at a village called Kanauti, in Bihar. The Prince  immediately assumed the succession, and, as a high aim leads to  high shooting, his title was to be nothing short of \"sovereign of  the known world,\" or SHAH ALAM. He is recorded to have ordered  that his reign should be reckoned from the day of his father's  \"martyrdom\"; and there are firmans of his patent-office still  forthcoming in confirmation of the record. He was at once  recognised as emperor by all parties; and, for his part, he  wisely confirmed Shujaa-ud-daulah as Vazir; while he intrusted  the command of the army in Hindustan, in the room of the assassin  Ghazi, to Najib-ud-daulah, the Abdali's nominee.    Having made these arrangements he proceeded to collect revenue  and establish himself in Bihar. He was at this time a tall,  portly man, forty years old, or thereabout, with the  constitutional character of his race, and some peculiarities of  his own. Like his ancestors, he was brave, patient, dignified,  and merciful; but all contemporary accounts support the view  suggested by his whole history, and debit him with defects which  more than balanced these great virtues. His courage was rather of  the nature of fortitude than of that enterprising boldness which  was absolutely necessary in his situation. His clemency did great  harm when it led him to forgive and ignore all that was done to  him, and to lend his ear and his hand to any person of stronger  will who was nearest to him at the moment. His patience was of a  kind which ere long degenerated into a simple compromise with  fortune, in which he surrendered lofty hopes for the future in  exchange for immediate gratifications of sense. In a word,  writers unacquainted with English history have combined to  produce a picture which bears a strong likeness, both in features  and position, to that of Charles the Second of Britain, after the  death of his father.    The Eastern Subahs were at this time held by Clive's nominee, Mir  Jafar Khan, known in English histories as Meer Jaffier, and the  Deputy in Bihar was a Hindu man of business, named Raja  Ramnarayan. This official, having sent to Murshidabad and  Calcutta for assistance, attempted to resist the proceedings of  his sovereign; but the Imperial army defeated him with  considerable loss, and the Hindu official, wounded in body and  alarmed in mind, retired into the shelter of Patna, which the  Moghuls did not, at that time, think fit to attack.    Meantime, the army of the Nawab having been joined by a small  British contingent, marched to meet the Emperor, who was worsted  in an engagement that occurred on the 15th of February, 1760. On  this the Emperor adopted the bold plan of a flank march, by which  he should cut between the Bengal troops and their capital,  Murshidabad, and possess himself of that town in the absence of  its defenders. But before he could reach Murshidabad, he was  again overtaken and repulsed by the activity of the English (7th  April), and, being by this time joined by a small body of French  under a distinguished officer, he resolved to remain in Bihar and  set about the siege of Patna.    These French were a party of about one hundred officers and men  who had refused to join in the capitulation of Chandarnagar three  years before, and had since been wandering about the country  persecuted by their relentless victor Clive. Their leader was the  Chevalier Law, a relation of the celebrated speculator of the  Regency; and he now hastened to lay at the feet of the Royal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#12)"],[1,"to do any possible and needful thing to right their  wrongs. But we must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on  to perform what we cannot; we must be calm and moderate, and consider  the whole difficulty, and determine what is possible and just. We must  not be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober  judgments would not approve in our cooler moments. We have higher aims;  we will have more serious business than to dally with temporary  measures.    We are here to stand firmly for a principle--to stand firmly for a  right. We know that great political and moral wrongs are done, and  outrages committed, and we denounce those wrongs and outrages, although  we cannot, at present, do much more. But we desire to reach out beyond  those personal outrages and establish a rule that will apply to all, and  so prevent any future outrages.    We have seen to-day that every shade of popular opinion is represented  here, with _Freedom_ or rather _Free-Soil_ as the basis. We have come  together as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the  extension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law,  and the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more.  We come--we are here assembled together--to protest as well as we can  against a great wrong, and to take measures, as well as we now can, to  make that wrong right; to place the nation, as far as it may be possible  now, as it was before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; and the  plain way to do this is to restore the Compromise, and to demand and  determine that _Kansas shall be free!_ [Immense applause.] While we  affirm, and reaffirm, if necessary, our devotion to the principles of  the Declaration of Independence, let our practical work here be limited  to the above. We know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment  here on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in  this convention, and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot  be helped; but all of us must give up something for the good of the  cause. There is one desire which is uppermost in the mind, one wish  common to us all--to which no dissent will be made; and I counsel you  earnestly to bury all resentment, to sink all personal feeling, make all  things work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about,  and which all present will agree is absolutely necessary--which _must_  be done by any rightful mode if there be such: _Slavery must be kept out  of Kansas_! [Applause.] The test--the pinch--is right there. If we lose  Kansas to freedom, an example will be set which will prove fatal to  freedom in the end. We, therefore, in the language of the _Bible_, must  \"lay the axe to the root of the tree.\" Temporizing will not do longer;  now is the time for decision--for firm, persistent, resolute action.  [Applause.]    The Nebraska bill, or rather Nebraska law, is not one of wholesome  legislation, but was and is an act of legislative usurpation, whose  result, if not indeed intention, is to make slavery national; and unless  headed off in some effective way, we are in a fair way to see this land  of boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact.  [Sensation.] Just open your two eyes, and see if this be not so. I need  do no more than state, to command universal approval, that almost the  entire North, as well as a large following in the border States, is  radically opposed to the planting of slavery in free territory. Probably  in a popular vote throughout the nation nine-tenths of the voters in the  free States, and at least one-half in the border States, if they could  express their sentiments freely, would vote NO on such an issue; and it  is safe to say that two-thirds of the votes of the entire nation would  be opposed to it. And yet, in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment  in this free country, we are in a fair way to see Kansas present itself  for admission as a slave State. Indeed, it is a felony, by the local law  of Kansas, to deny that slavery exists there even now. By every  principle of law, a negro in Kansas is free; yet the _bogus_  legislature makes it an infamous crime to tell him that he is free!    The party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and  liberty; for it is a singular fact, but none the less a fact, and well  known by the most common experience, that men will do things under the  terror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any  consideration do otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of  a loaded cannon without shrinking, will run from the terrible name of  \"Abolitionist,\" even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they,  with good reason, despise. For instance--to press this point a  little--Judge Douglas introduced his anti-Nebraska bill in January; and  we had an extra session of our legislature in the succeeding February,  in which were seventy-five Democrats; and at a party caucus, fully  attended, there were just three votes out of the whole seventy-five, for  the measure. But in a few days orders came on from Washington,  commanding them to approve the measure; the party lash was applied, and  it was brought up again in caucus, and passed by a large majority. The  masses were against it, but party necessity carried it; and it was  passed through the lower house of Congress against the will of the  people, for the same reason. Here is where the greatest danger  lies--that, while we profess to be a government of law and reason, law  will give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power.  Like the great Juggernaut--I think that is the name--the great idol, it  crushes everything that comes in its way, and makes a--or as I read  once, in a black-letter law book, \"a slave is a human being who is  legally not a _person_, but a _thing_.\" And if the safeguards to liberty  are broken down, as is now attempted, when they have made _things_ of  all the free negroes, how long, think you, before they will begin to  make _things_ of poor white men? [Applause.] Be not deceived.  Revolutions do not go backward. The founder of the Democratic party  declared that _all_ men were created equal. His successor in the  leadership has written the word \"white\" before men, making it read \"all  _white_ men are created equal.\" Pray, will or may not the Know-nothings,  if they should get in power, add the word \"protestant,\" making it read  \"_all protestant white men_\"?    Meanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in  other quarters. John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you  will recollect, calls the immortal Declaration \"a self-evident lie;\"  while at the birth-place of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of  the \"cradle of liberty,\" at the home of the Adamses and Warren and  Otis--Choate, from our side of the house, dares to fritter away the  birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be \"a  string of glittering generalities;\" and the Southern Whigs, working hand  in hand with pro-slavery Democrats, are making Choate's theories  practical. Thomas Jefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element  in slavery, solemnly declared that he \"trembled for his country when he  remembered that God is just;\" while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant  wave of the hand, \"don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted  down.\" Now, if slavery is right, or even negative, he has a right to  treat it in this trifling manner. But if it is a moral and political  wrong, as all Christendom considers it to be, how can he answer to God  for this attempt to spread and fortify it? [Applause.]    But no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other, can maintain a  negative, or merely neutral, position on this question; and,  accordingly, he avows that the Union was made _by_ white men and _for_  white men and their descendants. As matter of fact, the first branch of  the proposition is historically true; the government was made by white  men, and they were and are the superior race. This I admit. But the  corner-stone of the government, so to speak, was the declaration that  \"_all_ men are created equal,\" and all entitled to \"life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.\" [Applause.]    And not only so, but the framers of the Constitution were particular to  keep out of that instrument the word \"slave,\" the reason being that  slavery would ultimately come to an end, and they did not wish to have  any reminder that in this free country human beings were ever  prostituted to slavery. [Applause.] Nor is it any argument that we are  superior and the negro inferior--that he has but one talent while we  have ten. Let the negro possess the little he has in independence; if he  has but one talent, he should be permitted to keep the little he has.  [Applause.] But slavery will endure no test of reason or logic; and yet  its advocates, like Douglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy  assumption, it might better be termed, like the above, in order to  prepare the mind for the gradual, but none the less certain,  encroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon, the fair domain of freedom.  But however much you may argue upon it, or smother it in soft phrases,  slavery can only be maintained by force--by violence. The repeal of the  Missouri Compromise was by violence. It was a violation of both law and  the sacred obligations of honour, to overthrow and trample underfoot a  solemn compromise, obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the  fairest of our Western domains. Congress violated the will and  confidence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and while public  sentiment, as shown by the elections of 1854, demanded the restoration  of this compromise, Congress violated its trust by refusing, simply  because it had the force of numbers to hold on to it. And murderous  violence is being used now, in order to force slavery on to"]]]
