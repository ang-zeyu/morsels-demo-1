The king's daughter had a  pretty little dog, and was very fond of him, because he was so clever,  understanding everything that she wanted. When Vanek went into the room  with the king and his councillors, he made as if he didn't even see the  princess, but turned to the dog and said: \"I have heard, doggie, that  you are very clever, and I come to you for advice. We are three  companions in travel, a sculptor, a tailor, and myself. Once upon a time  we were going through a forest and were obliged to pass the night in it.  To be safe from wolves, we made a fire, and agreed to keep watch one  after the other. The sculptor kept watch first, and for amusement to  kill time took a log and carved a damsel out of it. When it was  finished, he woke the tailor to keep watch in his turn. The tailor,  seeing the wooden damsel, asked what it meant. 'As you see,' said the  sculptor, 'I was weary, and didn't know what to do with myself, so I  carved a damsel out of a log; if you find time hang heavy on your hands,  you can dress her.' The tailor at once took out his scissors, needle and  thread, cut out the clothes, stitched away, and, when they were ready,  dressed the damsel in them. He then called me to come and keep watch. I,  too, asked him what the meaning of all this was. 'As you see,' said the  tailor, 'the sculptor found time hang heavy on his hands and carved a  damsel out of a log, and I for the same reason clothed her; and if you  find time hanging on your hands, you can teach her to speak.' And by  morning dawn I had actually taught her to speak. But in the morning when  my companions woke up, each wanted to possess the damsel. The sculptor  said, 'I made her;' the tailor, 'I clothed her.' I, too, maintained my  right. Tell me, therefore, doggie, to which of us the damsel belongs.\"  The dog said nothing, but instead of the dog the princess replied: \"To  whom can she belong but to yourself? What's the good of the sculptor's  damsel without life? What's the good of the tailor's dressing without  speech? You gave her the best gift, life and speech, and therefore she  by right belongs to you.\" \"You have passed your own sentence,\" said  Vanek; \"I have given you speech again and a new life, and you therefore  by right belong to me.\" Then said one of the king's councillors: \"His  Royal Grace will give you a plenteous reward for succeeding in unloosing  his daughter's tongue; but you cannot have her to wife, as you are of  mean lineage.\" The king said: \"You are of mean lineage; I will give you  a plenteous reward instead of our daughter.\" But Vanek wouldn't hear of  any other reward, and said: \"The king promised without any exception,  that whoever caused his daughter to speak again should be her husband. A  king's word is law; and if the king wants others to observe his laws, he  must first keep them himself. Therefore the king _must_ give me his  daughter.\" \"Seize and bind him!\" shouted the councillor. \"Whoever says  the king _must_ do anything, offers an insult to his Majesty, and is  worthy of death. May it please your Majesty to order this malefactor to  be executed with the sword?\" The king said: \"Let him be executed.\" Vanek  was immediately bound and led to execution. When they came to the place  of execution Luck was there waiting for him, and said secretly to  Intelligence: \"See how this man has got on through you, till he has to  lose his head! Make way, and let me take your place!\" As soon as Luck  entered Vanek, the executioners sword broke against the scaffold, just  as if some one had snapped it; and before they brought him another, up  rode a trumpeter on horseback from the city, galloping as swift as a  bird, trumpeted merrily, and waved a white flag, and after him came the  royal carriage for Vanek. This is what had happened: The princess had  told her father at home that Vanek had but spoken the truth, and the  king's word ought not to be broken. If Vanek were of mean lineage the  king could easily make him a prince. The king said: \"You're right; let  him be a prince!\" The royal carriage was immediately sent for Vanek, and  the councillor who had irritated the king against him was executed in  his stead. Afterward, when Vanek and the princess were going together in  a carriage from the wedding, Intelligence happened to be somewhere on  the road, and seeing that he couldn't help meeting Luck, bent his head  and slipped on one side, just as if cold water had been thrown upon him.  And from that time forth it is said that Intelligence has always given a  wide berth to Luck whenever he has had to meet him.          XII    GEORGE WITH THE GOAT      There was a king who had a daughter who never could be induced to laugh;  she was always sad. So the king proclaimed that she should be given to  any one who could cause her to laugh. There was also a shepherd who had  a son named George. He said: \"Daddy! I, too, will go to see whether I  can make her laugh. I want nothing from you but the goat.\" His father  said, \"Well, go.\" The goat was of such a nature that, when her master  wished, she detained everybody, and that person was obliged to stay by  her.    So he took the goat and went, and met a man who had a foot on his  shoulder. George said: \"Why have you a foot on your shoulder?\" He  replied: \"If I take it off, I leap a hundred miles.\" \"Whither are you  going?\" \"I am going in search of service, to see if any one will take  me.\" \"Well, come with us.\"    They went on, and again met a man who had a bandage on his eyes. \"Why  have you a bandage on your eyes?\" He answered, \"If I remove the bandage,  I see a hundred miles.\" \"Whither are you going?\" \"I am going in search  of service, if you will take me.\" \"Yes, I'll take you. Come also with  me.\"    They went on a bit farther, and met another fellow, who had a bottle  under his arm, and, instead of a stopper, held his thumb in it. \"Why do  you hold your thumb there?\" \"If I pull it out, I squirt a hundred miles,  and besprinkle everything that I choose. If you like, take me also into  your service; it may be to your advantage and ours too.\" George replied:  \"Well, come, too!\"    Afterward they came to the town where the king lived, and bought a  silken riband for the goat. They came to an inn, and orders had already  been given there beforehand, that when such people came, they were to  give them what they liked to eat and drink--the king would pay for all.  So they tied the goat with that very riband and placed it in the  innkeeper's room to be taken care of, and he put it in the side room  where his daughters slept. The innkeeper had three maiden daughters, who  were not yet asleep. So Manka said: \"Oh! if I, too, could have such a  riband! I will go and unfasten it from that goat.\" The second, Dodla,  said: \"Don't; he'll find it out in the morning.\" But she went  notwithstanding. And when Manka did not return for a long time, the  third, Kate, said: \"Go, fetch her.\" So Dodla went, and gave Manka a pat  on the back. \"Come, leave it alone!\" And now she, too, was unable to  withdraw herself from her. So Kate said: \"Come, don't unfasten it!\" Kate  went and gave Dodla a pat on the petticoat; and now she, too, couldn't  get away, but was obliged to stay by her.    In the morning George made haste and went for the goat, and led the  whole set away--Kate Dodla, and Manka. The innkeeper was still asleep.  They went through the village, and the judge looked out of a window and  said, \"Fie, Kate! what's this? what's this?\" He went and took her by the  hand, wishing to pull her away, but remained also by her. After this, a  cowherd drove some cows through a narrow street, and the bull came  rushing round; he stuck fast, and George led him, too, in the  procession.    Thus they afterward came in front of the castle, and the servants came  out-of-doors; and when they saw such things they went and told the  king. \"Oh, sire, we have such a spectacle here; we have already had all  manner of masquerades, but this has never been here yet.\" So they  immediately led the king's daughter to the square in front of the  castle, and she looked and laughed till the castle shook.    Now they asked him what sort of person he was. He said that he was a  shepherd's son, and was named George. They said that it could not be  done; for he was of mean lineage, and they could not give him the  damsel; but he must accomplish something more for them. He said, \"What?\"  They replied that there was a spring yonder, a hundred miles off; if he  brought a goblet of water from it in a minute, then he should obtain the  damsel. So George said to the man who had the foot on his shoulder: \"You  said that if you took the foot down, you could jump a hundred miles.\" He  replied: \"I'll easily do that.\" He took the foot down, jumped, and was  there. But after this there was only a very little time to spare, and by  then he ought to have been back. So George said to the other: \"You said  that if you removed the bandage from your eyes, you could see a hundred  miles. Peep and see what is going on.\" \"Ah, sir! Goodness gracious! he's  fallen asleep!\" \"That will be a bad job,\" said George; \"the time will be  up. You, third man, you said if you pulled your thumb out, you could  squirt a hundred miles; be quick and squirt thither, that he may get up.  And you, look whether he is moving, or what.\" \"Oh, sir, he's getting up  now; he's knocking the dust off; he's drawing the water.\" He then gave a  jump, and was there exactly in time.    After this they said that he must perform one task more; that yonder, in  a rock, was a wild beast, a unicorn, of such a nature that he destroyed  a great many of their people; if he cleared him out of the world he  should obtain the damsel. So he took his people and went into the  forest. They came to a firwood. There were three wild beasts, and three  lairs had been formed by wallowing as they lay. Two did nothing:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],[0,"The Child's World: Third Reader (#12)"],[1,"I dance.\"    [Illustration: The rabbit danced as the wolf shook the rattle]    So the wolf stood in the middle of the field, patting his foot and  shaking a rattle while the rabbit danced around him and sang,      \"Watch me dance around the field,    Watch me dance around the field,        Hi, la, hi, la, hi!\"    Then the rabbit made a ring in the middle of the field. He said to the  wolf, \"Now, you dance around this ring, and sing just as I do.\"    He made a larger ring for himself and danced around just beyond the  wolf. The wolf thought that this was the finest dance he had ever seen.  He and the rabbit danced faster and faster, and sang louder and louder.    As the rabbit danced, he moved nearer and nearer to the edge of the  field. The wolf was dancing so fast and singing so loud that he did not  notice this.    The rabbit kept on singing,      \"Now I dance on the edge of the field,    Now I dance on the edge of the field,    Hi, la, hi, la, hi!\"    At last, Brother Rabbit reached the edge of the field; then he jumped  into the blackberry bushes and ran away. The wolf tried to give chase,  but he was so dizzy that he could not run. And the rabbit got away  without having his ears cut off.    --SOUTHERN INDIAN TALE.          BLOCK CITY        What are you able to build with your blocks?    Castles and palaces, temples and docks.    Rain may keep raining, and others go roam,    But I can be happy and building at home.      Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,    There I'll establish a city for me:    A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,    And a harbor as well where my vessels may ride.      Great is the palace with pillar and wall,    A sort of a tower on the top of it all,    And steps coming down in an orderly way    To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.      This one is sailing and that one is moored:    Hark to the song of the sailors on board!    And see on the steps of my palace, the kings    Coming and going with presents and things!      Now I have done with it, down let it go.    All in a moment the town is laid low,    Block upon block lying scattered and free,    What is there left of my town by the sea?    --ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.          A GOOD PLAY        We built a ship upon the stairs    All made of the back-bedroom chairs,    And filled it full of sofa pillows    To go a-sailing on the billows.      We took a saw and several nails,    And water in the nursery pails;    And Tom said, \"Let us also take    An apple and a slice of cake;\"--    Which was enough for Tom and me    To go a-sailing on, till tea.      We sailed along for days and days,    And had the very best of plays;    But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,    So there was no one left but me.    --ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.          THE MONKEY'S FIDDLE    I      Once upon a time there was a great famine in the land, and Monkey could  find no food. There were no bulbs, no beans, no insects, nor anything  else to eat.    At last Monkey said to himself, \"Why should I perish here with hunger?  My uncle Orang-outang has enough and to spare; I shall go to him, and he  will give me food and shelter.\"    So he set out and soon came to the place where Orang-outang lived. For a  long time Monkey was happy in his new home, but by and by he heard that  there was no longer a famine in his own land. Then he decided to go  back.    Before he started, Orang-outang made him a present of a fiddle and of a  bow and arrow,    \"With this bow and arrow you can kill any animal,\" he said. \"With this  fiddle you can make anything dance until you bid it stop.\"    Thanking his uncle for the presents, Monkey set out on his homeward  journey. On the way he met Brother Wolf.    \"What news, Brother Wolf?\" asked Monkey.    When Wolf had told him the news, Monkey asked, \"What have you been doing  to-day?\"    \"Oh,\" said Wolf, \"I have been following a deer all the morning, but I  have been unable to get near enough to kill him. Now I am faint with  hunger.\"    \"I can help you,\" said Monkey. \"I have a magic bow and arrow. Show me  the deer, and I will bring him down.\"    When Wolf showed him the deer, Monkey fitted an arrow to the bow and  took aim. Hardly had the arrow left the bow when the deer fell dead.    Monkey and Wolf sat down and had a good feast. As Wolf ate, he thought  of the magic bow and arrow, and he planned to get them away from Monkey.    \"First I will ask for them,\" he said to himself. \"If Monkey will not  give them to me, I will use force.\"    [Illustration: Wolf demands the bow and arrow]    When Wolf had finished eating, he said to Monkey, \"Please give me the  bow and arrow.\"    \"I will not,\" said Monkey. \"They were a present from my dear uncle; why  should I give them to you?\"    \"Very well,\" said Wolf. \"I am stronger than you, and I will take them by  force.\"      II      Wolf was just about to snatch the bow and arrow from Monkey when Jackal  came along. Then Wolf thought of a new plan.    He called out to Jackal, \"Help! help! Monkey has stolen my magic bow and  arrow.\"    Jackal came running to them. Wolf told his side of the story, and Monkey  told his.    \"I cannot believe either of you,\" said Jackal. \"Let us lay the question  before the court. There Lion, Tiger, and the other animals will hear you  both; perhaps they will be able to decide to whom the magic bow and  arrow belong. But to keep you two from quarreling, I had better take  care of the bow and arrow.\"    Monkey gave them to Jackal, and all three started off to court. When  they arrived, there sat Lion on the throne. Seated around were the other  animals of the jungle.    Monkey told his story first. Standing in front of the throne, he made a  low bow and said, \"The great famine, my lord, drove me out of my  country, and I had to take refuge with my uncle. When I started back  home, he gave me this bow and arrow. Finding Wolf almost starving, I  shot a deer for him. Instead of being grateful for the food, he tried to  rob me of the bow and arrow. I am here to ask that you restore them to  me.\"    \"He does not tell the truth,\" cried Wolf.    Then Jackal said, \"I believe that the bow and arrow belong to Wolf; he  and Monkey were quarreling about them when I came along. They agreed to  leave the question to you, King Lion. I know you will see that justice  is done.\"    Wolf looked very innocent and said nothing.    King Lion rose and asked, \"What say you? To whom do the bow and arrow  belong?\"    \"To Wolf,\" they all cried.    \"Stealing is a crime that must be punished,\" said King Lion. \"What shall  be done?\"    \"Let Monkey be hanged,\" they all cried.    Monkey still had his magic fiddle. Holding it in his hand, he made a  deep bow and said: \"Give me leave to play a tune on my fiddle before I  hang, O King.\"    Now, the beasts all loved a merry tune, and knowing that Monkey was a  master player they called out, \"Let him play.\"      III      Monkey placed the fiddle under his chin, drew the bow across the  strings, and struck up \"Cockcrow.\" This was a favorite tune with the  court. At the first notes all nodded their heads in time to the music.  As Monkey played on, the entire court began to dance.    Round and round they went like a whirlwind. Over and over, quicker and  quicker sounded the tune of \"Cockcrow.\" Faster and faster flew the  dancers, until one after another fell to the ground worn out.    Monkey saw nothing of all this. With eyes closed and his head placed  lovingly against the fiddle, he played on and on, keeping time with his  foot.    Wolf was the first one to cry out, \"Please stop, Cousin Monkey. For  pity's sake, stop.\"    But Monkey did not seem to hear him. Again and again sounded the magic  notes of \"Cockcrow.\"    King Lion had gone round and round with his young wife so many times  that both were ready to drop. At last, as he passed Monkey, he roared,  \"Stop, ape! My whole kingdom is yours if you will only stop playing.\"    \"I do not want it,\" said Monkey. \"Make Wolf confess that he tried to  steal my bow and arrow. Then I will stop playing.\"    \"I confess! I confess!\" panted Wolf, who was ready to fall to the  ground.    \"Good,\" cried King Lion, as the music stopped. \"Monkey is innocent. Let  him have his bow and arrow.\"    \"Punish Wolf!\" cried the animals.    So Wolf was soundly beaten and driven from the court. Then Monkey went  off rejoicing, carrying with him his magic gifts.    --AFRICAN TALE.          THE THREE TASKS    I      There were once two brothers who set out to seek their fortune. They  wasted their time and their money in all sorts of foolish ways, and  before long they were nearly penniless.    After the two brothers had been gone some time, their younger brother,  who had always been thought the simpleton of the family, set out to seek  his fortune.    One day as he was passing through a village far away from home, he found  his two brothers.    \"Where are you going?\" they asked.    \"I am going to seek my fortune,\" he replied.    \"Ha, ha! how foolish you are!\" they cried. \"With all our wit and wisdom  we have been unable to make our fortune. It is silly of you even to  try.\" And they laughed and made fun of him.    Nevertheless, the three brothers decided to travel on together. As they  journeyed on, they saw a large ant hill by the side of the road. The two  elder brothers were about to destroy it, when the simpleton said, \"Leave  the poor ants alone. I will not let you disturb them.\"    They went on their way until they came to a pond upon which two ducks  were swimming. The two older brothers were about to kill them, when the  simpleton said, \"Leave them alone. I will not let you kill them.\"    Soon the three came to a tree, in the trunk of which was a wild bee's  nest. The two older brothers wished to steal the honey. They started to  make a fire under the tree and smoke out the bees. The simpleton said,  \"Leave the poor bees alone. I will not let you rob them.\"      II      At last the three brothers came to a"]]]
