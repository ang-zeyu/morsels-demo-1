[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the BÃ¡b (#12)"],[1,"'s appointed Day which the merciful Lord hath  promised you in His Book; wherefore, in very truth, glorify ye abundantly  the name of God while treading the Path of the Most Great Remembrance...    Verily God hath granted leave to His Remembrance to say whatsoever He  willeth in whatever manner He pleaseth. Indeed whatsoever He chooseth is  none other than what is chosen by Us. The Lord, in truth, witnesseth all  things. _Chapter LXXXVII._          \"Indeed We conversed with Moses by the leave of God ...\"      Indeed We conversed with Moses by the leave of God from the midst of the  Burning Bush in the Sinai and revealed an infinitesimal glimmer of Thy  Light upon the Mystic Mount and its dwellers, whereupon the Mount shook to  its foundations and was crushed into dust...    O peoples of the earth! I swear by your Lord! Ye shall act as former  generations have acted. Warn ye, then, yourselves of the terrible, the  most grievous vengeance of God. For God is, verily, potent over all  things. _Chapter LIII._          \"O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! I recognize in Thee none other ...\"      O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! I recognize in Thee none other except the 'Great  Announcement'--the Announcement voiced by the Concourse on high. By this  name, I bear witness, they that circle the Throne of Glory have ever known  Thee.    O concourse of the believers! Do ye harbour any doubt as to that whereunto  the Remembrance of God doth summon you? By the righteousness of the One  true God, He is none other than the sovereign Truth Who hath been made  manifest through the power of Truth. Are ye in doubt concerning the Bab?  Verily He is the One Who holdeth, by Our leave, the kingdoms of earth and  heaven in His grasp, and the Lord is in truth fully aware of what ye are  doing...    Indeed I am but a man like unto you. However, God bestoweth upon Me  whatever favours He willeth as He pleaseth, and that which your Lord hath  decreed in the Mother Book is unbounded. _Chapter LXXXVIII._          \"God, of a truth, revealed unto Me in the sacred house of ...\"      God, of a truth, revealed unto Me in the sacred house of the Ka'bah,  'Verily, I am God, no God is there but Me. I have singled Thee out for  Myself and have chosen Thee as the Remembrance. Indeed, whosoever beareth  allegiance unto Thee by walking in the way of the Bab, for him the  recompense of the next world hath surely been prescribed...' It is  ordained in the Book that upon the realization of the Cause of the  Remembrance, the Most Great Event will have come to pass according to the  dispensation of Providence, and God, truly, is potent over all things.  _Chapter LXXIX._          \"O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: Verily I am the One Who is ...\"      O Qurratu'l-'Ayn! Say: Verily I am the One Who is hailed in the Mother  Book as the 'Great Announcement'. Say: The people have grievously differed  over Me, whereas in truth there is no difference between Me and the Bab;  and God, the Eternal Truth, is sufficient witness. _Chapter LXXVII._          \"I Am the Mystic Fane which the Hand of Omnipotence ...\"      I am the Mystic Fane which the Hand of Omnipotence hath reared. I am the  Lamp which the Finger of God hath lit within its niche and caused to shine  with deathless splendour. I am the Flame of that supernal Light that  glowed upon Sinai in the gladsome Spot, and lay concealed in the midst of  the Burning Bush. _Chapter XCIV._          \"As a token of pure justice, We have indeed sent tidings ...\"      As a token of pure justice, We have indeed sent tidings unto every Prophet  concerning the Cause of Our Remembrance, and verily God is supreme over  all the peoples of the world. _Chapter LXXXIII._            3: EXCERPTS FROM THE PERSIAN BAYAN          \"It is better to guide one soul than to possess all ...\"      It is better to guide one soul than to possess all that is on earth, for  as long as that guided soul is under the shadow of the Tree of Divine  Unity, he and the one who hath guided him will both be recipients of God's  tender mercy, whereas possession of earthly things will cease at the time  of death. The path to guidance is one of love and compassion, not of force  and coercion. This hath been God's method in the past, and shall continue  to be in the future! He causeth him whom He pleaseth to enter the shadow  of His Mercy. Verily, He is the Supreme Protector, the All-Generous.    There is no paradise more wondrous for any soul than to be exposed to  God's Manifestation in His Day, to hear His verses and believe in them, to  attain His presence, which is naught but the presence of God, to sail upon  the sea of the heavenly kingdom of His good-pleasure, and to partake of  the choice fruits of the paradise of His divine Oneness. II, 16.(58)          \"Worship thou God in such wise that if thy worship lead ...\"      Worship thou God in such wise that if thy worship lead thee to the fire,  no alteration in thine adoration would be produced, and so likewise if thy  recompense should be paradise. Thus and thus alone should be the worship  which befitteth the one True God. Shouldst thou worship Him because of  fear, this would be unseemly in the sanctified Court of His presence, and  could not be regarded as an act by thee dedicated to the Oneness of His  Being. Or if thy gaze should be on paradise, and thou shouldst worship Him  while cherishing such a hope, thou wouldst make God's creation a partner  with Him, notwithstanding the fact that paradise is desired by men.    Fire and paradise both bow down and prostrate themselves before God. That  which is worthy of His Essence is to worship Him for His sake, without  fear of fire, or hope of paradise.    Although when true worship is offered, the worshipper is delivered from  the fire, and entereth the paradise of God's good-pleasure, yet such  should not be the motive of his act. However, God's favour and grace ever  flow in accordance with the exigencies of His inscrutable wisdom.    The most acceptable prayer is the one offered with the utmost spirituality  and radiance; its prolongation hath not been and is not beloved by God.  The more detached and the purer the prayer, the more acceptable is it in  the presence of God. VII, 19.          \"The Day of Resurrection is a day on which the sun riseth ...\"      The Day of Resurrection is a day on which the sun riseth and setteth like  unto any other day. How oft hath the Day of Resurrection dawned, and the  people of the land where it occurred did not learn of the event. Had they  heard, they would not have believed, and thus they were not told!    When the Apostle of God [Muhammad] appeared, He did not announce unto the  unbelievers that the Resurrection had come, for they could not bear the  news. That Day is indeed an infinitely mighty Day, for in it the Divine  Tree proclaimeth from eternity unto eternity, 'Verily, I am God. No God is  there but Me'. Yet those who are veiled believe that He is one like unto  them, and they refuse even to call Him a believer, although such a title  in the realm of His heavenly Kingdom is conferred everlastingly upon the  most insignificant follower of His previous Dispensation. Thus, had the  people in the days of the Apostle of God regarded Him at least as a  believer of their time how would they have debarred Him, for seven years  while He was in the mountain, from access to His Holy House [Ka'bah]?  Likewise in this Dispensation of the Point of the Bayan, if the people had  not refused to concede the name believer unto Him, how could they have  incarcerated Him on this mountain, without realizing that the quintessence  of belief oweth its existence to a word from Him? Their hearts are  deprived of the power of true insight, and thus they cannot see, while  those endowed with the eyes of the spirit circle like moths round the  Light of Truth until they are consumed. It is for this reason that the Day  of Resurrection is said to be the greatest of all days, yet it is like  unto any other day. VIII, 9.          \"There is no paradise, in the estimation of the believers in ...\"      There is no paradise, in the estimation of the believers in the Divine  Unity, more exalted than to obey God's commandments, and there is no fire  in the eyes of those who have known God and His signs, fiercer than to  transgress His laws and to oppress another soul, even to the extent of a  mustard seed. On the Day of Resurrection God will, in truth, judge all  men, and we all verily plead for His grace. V, 19.          \"God loveth those who are pure. Naught in the Bayan and ...\"      God loveth those who are pure. Naught in the Bayan and in the sight of God  is more loved than purity and immaculate cleanliness....    God desireth not to see, in the Dispensation of the Bayan, any soul  deprived of joy and radiance. He indeed desireth that under all  conditions, all may be adorned with such purity, both inwardly and  outwardly, that no repugnance may be caused even to themselves, how much  less unto others. V, 14.          \"Likewise consider the manifestation of the Point of the ...\"      Likewise consider the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan. There are  people who every night until morning busy themselves with the worship of  God, and even at present when the Day-Star of Truth is nearing its zenith  in the heaven of its Revelation, they have not yet left their prayer-rugs.  If any one of them ever heard the wondrous verses of God recited unto him,  he would exclaim: 'Why dost thou keep me back from offering my prayers?' O  thou who are wrapt in veils! If thou makest mention of God, wherefore  sufferest thou thyself to be shut out from Him Who hath kindled the light  of worship in thy heart? If He had not previously revealed the injunction:  'Verily, make ye mention of God'(59), what would have prompted thee to  offer devotion unto God, and whereunto wouldst thou turn in prayer?    Know thou of a certainty that whenever thou makest mention of Him Whom God  shall make manifest,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],[0,"With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#12)"],[1," week at Pondicherry, Mr. Floyer  began to hesitate, but he could not make up his mind, and Admiral  Boscawen, who had received orders to return home, could no longer act  in contravention to them, and was obliged to sail.    \"The instant the fleet had left, and we remained virtually  defenceless, Chunda Sahib, supplied with troops and money by Dupleix,  marched out from Pondicherry and joined Muzaffar Jung, with the avowed  intention of marching upon Trichinopoli. Had he done this at once, he  must have taken the place, and it was a question of weeks and days  only of our being turned altogether out of Southern India. Nothing,  indeed, could have saved us.    \"Muzaffar Jung and Chunda Sahib, however, disregarding the plan which  Dupleix had marked out for them, resolved, before marching on  Trichinopoli, to conquer Tanjore, which is the richest city in  Southern India. The rajah had, only a few weeks before, made peace  with us; and he now sent messengers to Nazir Jung, Muzaffar's rival in  the Deccan, and to the English, imploring their assistance. Both  parties resolved at once to grant it, for alone both must have been  overwhelmed by the alliance between the two Indian princes and the  French; and their only hope of a successful resistance to this  combination was in saving Trichinopoli.    \"The march of these allies upon Tanjore opened the road to  Trichinopoli; and Captain Cope, with a hundred and twenty men, were at  once despatched to reinforce Muhammud Ali's garrison. Of this little  force, he sent off twenty men to the aid of the Rajah of Tanjore, and  these, under cover of the night, passed through the lines of the  besiegers and into the city, which was strongly fortified and able to  stand a long siege.    \"The English at once entered into a treaty with Nazir Jung, promising  him six hundred English troops; to assist him in maintaining his  sovereignty of the Deccan, and in aiding to place Muhammud Ali in the  nawabship of the Carnatic.    \"Tanjore held out bravely. For some weeks the rajah had thrown dust in  the eyes of Chunda Sahib, by pretending to negotiate. Then, when the  allies attacked, he defended the city for fifty-two days, at the end  of which one of the gates of the town had been captured, and the city  was virtually at the mercy of the besiegers. He again delayed them by  entering into negotiations for surrender. In vain Dupleix continued to  urge Chunda Sahib to act energetically, and to enter Tanjore.    \"Chunda Sahib, however, although he has a good head for planning, is  irresolute in action. His troops were discontented at the want of pay.  The French contingent also was demoralized, from the same cause. The  troops feared to engage in a desperate struggle, in the streets of a  town abounding with palaces, each of which was virtually a fortress;  especially as it was known that Nazir Jung was marching, with all  speed, to fall upon their rear. So at last the siege was broken up,  and the army fell back upon Pondicherry.    \"Meanwhile Cope's detachment of a hundred men, with six thousand  native horsemen, escorted Muhammud Ali to join Nazir Jung at Valdaur,  fifteen miles from Pondicherry. Lawrence was busy at work at Fort  Saint David, organizing a force to go to his aid. Dupleix saw that it  was necessary to aid his allies energetically. The army, on its return  from the siege of Tanjore, was reorganized; the French contingent  increased to two thousand men; and a supply of money furnished, from  his private means.    \"The army set out to attack Nazir Jung and his ally at Valdaur. When  the battle began, however, the French contingent mutinied and refused  to fight; and the natives, panic stricken by the desertion of their  allies, fell back on Pondicherry. Chunda Sahib accompanied his men.  Muzaffar Jung surrendered to his uncle, the usurper.    \"In three or four days the discipline of the French army was restored,  and on the 13th of April it attacked and defeated a detachment of  Nazir Jung's army; and a few days later captured the strong temple of  Tiruvadi, sixteen miles from Fort Saint David.    \"Some months passed before the French were completely prepared; but on  September the first, D'Auteuil, who commanded the French, and Chunda  Sahib attacked the army of the native princes, twenty thousand strong,  and defeated it utterly, the French not losing a single man. Muhammud  Ali, with only two attendants, fled to Arcot, and the victory rendered  Chunda Sahib virtual master of the Carnatic.    \"Muzaffar Jung, after his surrender to his uncle, had been loaded with  chains, and remained a prisoner in the camp; where, however, he  managed to win over several of the leaders of his uncle's army. Gingee  was stormed by a small French force, and the French officer there  entered into a correspondence with the conspirators, and it was  arranged that, when the French army attacked Nazir Jung, these should  declare against him.    \"On the 15th December the French commander, with eight hundred  Europeans, three thousand Sepoys, and ten guns, marched against Nazir  Jung, whose army of twenty-five thousand men opposed him. These,  however, he defeated easily. While the battle was going on, the  conspirators murdered Nazir Jung, released Muzaffar Jung, and saluted  him as subadar. His escape was a fortunate one, for his uncle had  ordered him to be executed that very day.    \"Muzaffar Jung proceeded to Pondicherry, where he was received with  great honors. He nominated Dupleix Nawab of the Carnatic and  neighbouring countries, with Chunda Sahib as his deputy, conferred the  highest dignities upon him, and granted the French possession of all  the lands and forts they had conquered. He arranged with Dupleix a  plan for common action, and agreed that a body of French troops should  remain permanently at his capital.\"        Chapter 6: The Arrival Of Clive.      \"I have nearly brought down the story to the present time,\" Mr.  Johnson said. \"One event has taken place, however, which was of  importance. Muzaffar Jung set out for Hyderabad, accompanied by a  French contingent under Bussy. On the way, the chiefs who had  conspired against Nazir Jung mutinied against his successor. Muzaffar  charged them with his cavalry. Two of the three chief conspirators  were killed and, while pursuing the third, Muzaffar was himself  killed.    \"Bussy at once released from confinement a son of Nazir Jung,  proclaimed him Subadar of the Deccan, escorted him to Hyderabad, and  received from him the cession of considerable fresh grants of  territory to the French. The latter were now everywhere triumphant,  and Trichinopoli and Tanjore were, with the three towns held by the  English, the sole places which resisted their authority. Muhammud Ali,  deeming further resistance hopeless, had already opened negotiations  with Dupleix for the surrender of Trichinopoli. Dupleix agreed to his  conditions; but when Muhammud Ali found that Count Bussy, with the  flower of the French force, had been despatched to Hyderabad, he  gained time by raising fresh demands, which would require the  ratification of the subadar.    \"Luckily for us Mr. Floyer had been recalled, and his place taken by  Mr. Saunders; who is, everyone says, a man of common sense and  determination. Muhammud Ali urged upon him the necessity for the  English to make common cause with him against the enemy, for if  Trichinopoli fell, it would be absolutely impossible for the English  to resist the French and their allies. Early this year, then, Mr.  Saunders assured him that he should be assisted with all our strength,  and Muhammud Ali thereupon broke off the negotiations with the French.    \"Most unfortunately for us, Major Lawrence had gone home to England on  sick leave. Captain Gingen, who now commands our troops, is a wretched  substitute for him. Captain Cope is no better.    \"Early this year Mr. Saunders sent Cope, with two hundred and eighty  English and three hundred Sepoys, to Trichinopoli. Benefiting by the  delay which was caused before Dupleix, owing to the absence of his  best troops at Hyderabad, could collect an army, Cope laid siege to  Madura, but was defeated and had to abandon his guns. Three thousand  of Muhammud Ali's native troops thereupon deserted to the enemy.    \"The cause of the English now appeared lost. Dupleix planted the white  flags, emblems of the authority of France, in the fields within sight  of Fort Saint David. With immense efforts, Mr. Saunders put into the  field five hundred English troops, a thousand Sepoys, a hundred  Africans, and eight guns; under the command of Captain Gingen, whose  orders were to follow the movements of the army with which D'Auteuil  and Chunda Sahib were marching against Trichinopoli.    \"Luckily Chunda Sahib, instead of doing so at once, moved northwards  to confirm his authority in the towns of North and South Arcot, and to  raise additional levies. Great delay was caused by this. On arriving  before the important fortress of Valkonda, Chunda Sahib found before  it the troops of Captain Gingen, who had been reinforced by sixteen  hundred troops from Trichinopoli. The governor of the place, not  knowing which party was the stronger, refused to yield to either; and  for a fortnight the armies lay at a short distance from each other,  near the fortress, with whose governor both continued their  negotiations.    \"Gingen then lost patience and attacked the place, but was repulsed,  and the governor at once admitted the French within the fortress. The  next day the main body of the French attacked us, the guns of the  fortress opening fire upon us at the same time. Our men, a great  portion of whom were recruits just joined from England, fell into a  panic and bolted, abandoning their allies and leaving their guns,  ammunition, and stores in the hands of the enemy.    \"Luckily, D'Auteuil was laid up with gout. If he had pressed on, there  remained only the two or three hundred men under"]]]
