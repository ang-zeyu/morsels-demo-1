Five Witches were lately Executed, impudently  demanding of God a Miraculous Vindication of their Innocency.\"[30]    And yet how absurd was much of the testimony that led to such wholesale  murder. We have seen some of it already. Note these words by a witness  against Martha Carrier, as presented in Cotton Mather's _Wonders of the  Invisible World_: \"The devil carry'd them on a pole to a witch-meeting;  but the pole broke, and she hanging about Carrier's neck, they both  fell down, and she then received an hurt by the fall whereof she was not  at this very time recovered.... This rampant hag, Martha Carrier, was  the person, of whom the confessions of the witches, and of her own  children among the rest, agreed, that the devil had promised her she  should be Queen of Hell.\"    Here and there a few brave souls dared to protest against the outrage;  but they were exceedingly few. Lady Phipps, wife of the governor, risked  her life by signing a paper for the discharge of a prisoner condemned  for witchcraft. The jailor reluctantly obeyed and lost his position for  allowing the prisoner to go; but in after years the act must have been a  source of genuine consolation to him. Only fear must have restrained the  more thoughtful citizens from similar acts of mercy. Even children were  imprisoned, and so cruelly treated that some lost their reason. In the  _New England History and General Register_ (XXV, 253) is found this  pathetic note: \"Dorcas Good, thus sent to prison 'as hale and well as  other children,' lay there seven or eight months, and 'being chain'd in  the dungeon was so hardly used and terrifyed' that eighteen years later  her father alleged 'that she hath ever since been very, chargeable,  haveing little or no reason to govern herself.'\"[31]    How many extracts from those old writings might be presented to make a  graphic picture of that era of horror and bloodshed. No one, no matter  what his family, his manner of living, his standing in the community,  was safe. Women feared to do the least thing unconventional; for it was  an easy task to obtain witnesses, and the most paltry evidence might  cause most unfounded charges. And the only way to escape death, be it  remembered, was through confession. Otherwise the witch or wizard was  still in the possession of the devil, and, since Satan was plotting the  destruction of the Puritan church, anything and anybody in the power of  Satan must be destroyed. Those who met death were martyrs who would not  confess a lie, and such died as a protest against common liberty of  conscience. No monument has been erected to their memory, but their  names remain in the old annals as a warning against bigotry and  fanaticism. Though some suffered the agonies of a horrible death, there  were innumerable women who lived and yet probably suffered a thousand  deaths in fear and foreboding. Hear once more the words of Robert  Calef's ancient book, _More Wonders of the Invisible World_: \"It was the  latter end of February, 1691, when divers young persons belonging to Mr.  Parris's family, and one or more of the neighbourhood, began to act  after a strange and unusual manner, viz., by getting into holes, and  creeping under chairs and stools, and to use sundry odd postures and  antick gestures, uttering foolish, ridiculous speeches.... The  physicians that were called could assign no reason for this; but it  seems one of them ... told them he was afraid they were bewitched....  March the 11th, Mr. Parris invited several neighbouring ministers to  join with him in keeping a solemn day of prayer at his own house....  Those ill affected ... first complained of ... the said Indian woman,  named Tituba; she confessed that the devil urged her to sign a book ...  and also to work mischief to the children, etc.\"    \"A child of Sarah Good's was likewise apprehended, being between 4 and 5  years old. The accusers said this child bit them, and would shew such  like marks, as those of a small set of teeth, upon their arms....\"    \"March 31, 1692, was set apart as a day of solemn humiliation at  Salem ... on which day Abigail Williams said, 'that she saw a great number  of persons in the village at the administration of a mock sacrament, where  they had bread as red as raw flesh, and red drink.'\"    The husband of Mrs. Cary, who afterwards escaped, tells this: \"Having  been there [in prison] one night, next morning the jailer put irons on  her legs (having received such a command); the weight of them was about  eight pounds: these with her other afflictions soon brought her into  convulsion fits, so that I thought she would have died that night. I  sent to entreat that the irons might be taken off; but all entreaties  were in vain....\"    \"John Proctor and his wife being in prison, the sheriff came to his  house and seized all the goods, provisions and cattle ... and left  nothing in the house for the support of the children....\"    \"Old Jacobs being condemned, the sheriff and officers came and seized  all he had; his wife had her wedding ring taken from her ... and the  neighbours in charity relieved her.\"    \"The family of the Putnams ... were chief prosecutors in this business.\"    \"And now nineteen persons having been hanged, and one pressed to death,  and eight more condemned, in all twenty and eight ... about fifty  having confessed ... above an hundred and fifty in prison, and above two  hundred more accused; the special commission of oyer and terminer comes  to a period....\"    During the summer of 1692 the disastrous material and financial results  of the reign of terror became so evident that the shrewd business sense  of the colonist became alarmed. Harvests were ungathered, fields and  cattle were neglected, numerous people sold their farms and moved  southward; some did not await the sale but abandoned their property. The  thirst for blood could not last, especially when it threatened  commercial ruin. Moreover, the accusers at length aimed too high;  accusations were made against persons of rank, members of the governor's  family, and even the relatives of the pastors themselves. \"The killing  time lasted about four months, from the first of June to the end of  September, 1692, and then a reaction came because the informers began to  strike at important persons, and named the wife of the governor. Twenty  persons had been put to death ... and if the delusion had lasted much  longer under the rules of evidence that were adopted everybody in the  colony except the magistrates and ministers would have been either hung  or would have stood charged with witchcraft.\"[32]    The Puritan clergymen have been severely blamed for this strange wave of  fanaticism, and no doubt, as leaders in the movement, they were largely  responsible; but even their power and authority could never have caused  such wide-spread terror, had not the women of the day given such active  aid. The feminine soul, with its long pent emotions, craved excitement,  and this was an opportunity eagerly seized upon. As Fisher says, \"As  their religion taught them to see in human nature only depravity and  corruption, so in the outward nature by which they were surrounded, they  saw forewarnings and signs of doom and dread. Where the modern mind now  refreshes itself in New England with the beauties of the seashore, the  forest, and the sunset, the Puritan saw only threatenings of  terror.\"[33]    We cannot doubt in most instances the sincerity of these men and women,  and in later days, when confessions of rash and hasty charges of action  were made, their repentance was apparently just as sincere. Judge  Sewall, for instance, read before the assembled congregation his  petition to God for forgiveness. \"In a short time all the people  recovered from their madness, [and] admitted their error.... In 1697 the  General Court ordered a day of fasting and prayer for what had been done  amiss in the 'late tragedy raised among us by Satan.' Satan was the  scapegoat, and nothing was said about the designs and motives of the  ministers.\"[34] Possibly it was just as well that Satan was blamed; for  the responsibility is thus shifted for one of the most hideous pages in  American history.      _IX. Religion Outside of New England_    Apparently it was only under Puritanism that the colonial woman really  suffered through the requirements of her religion. In other colonies  there may have been those who felt hampered and restrained; but  certainly in New York, Pennsylvania, and the Southern provinces, there  was no creed that made life an existence of dread and fear. In most  parts of the South the Established Church of England was the authorized,  or popular, religious institution, and it would seem that the women who  followed its teachings were as reverent and pious, if not so full of the  fear of judgment, as their sisters to the North. The earliest settlers  of Virginia dutifully observed the customs and ceremonies of the  established church, and it was the dominant form of religion in Virginia  and the Carolinas throughout the colonial era. John Smith has left the  record of the first place and manner of divine worship in Virginia: \"Wee  did hang an awning, which is an old saile, to three or four trees to  shadow us from the Sunne; our walls were railes of Wood; our seats  unhewed trees till we cut plankes; our Pulpit a bar of wood nailed to  two neighbouring trees. In foul weather we shifted into an old rotten  tent; this came by way of adventure for new. This was our Church till we  built a homely thing like a barne set upon Cratchets, covered with  rafts, sedge, and earth; so also was the walls; the best of our houses  were of like curiosity.... Yet we had daily Common Prayer morning and  evening; every Sunday two sermons; and every three months a holy  Communion till our Minister died: but our Prayers daily with an Homily  on Sundays wee continued two or three years after, till more Preachers  came."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#12)"],[1,"both these special forms of symbols has not  died out. Recently discovered things, like the airship, are at once  brought into universal use as sex symbols.    It would be quite an error to suppose that a profounder knowledge of  dream symbolism (the \"Language of Dreams\") would make us independent of  questioning the dreamer regarding his impressions about the dream, and  would give us back the whole technique of ancient dream interpreters.  Apart from individual symbols and the variations in the use of what is  general, one never knows whether an element in the dream is to be  understood symbolically or in its proper meaning; the whole content of  the dream is certainly not to be interpreted symbolically. The knowledge  of dream symbols will only help us in understanding portions of the  dream content, and does not render the use of the technical rules  previously given at all superfluous. But it must be of the greatest  service in interpreting a dream just when the impressions of the dreamer  are withheld or are insufficient.    Dream symbolism proves also indispensable for understanding the  so-called \"typical\" dreams and the dreams that \"repeat themselves.\"  Dream symbolism leads us far beyond the dream; it does not belong only  to dreams, but is likewise dominant in legend, myth, and saga, in wit  and in folklore. It compels us to pursue the inner meaning of the dream  in these productions. But we must acknowledge that symbolism is not a  result of the dream work, but is a peculiarity probably of our  unconscious thinking, which furnishes to the dream work the matter for  condensation, displacement, and dramatization.

IV    DREAM ANALYSIS      Perhaps we shall now begin to suspect that dream interpretation is  capable of giving us hints about the structure of our psychic apparatus  which we have thus far expected in vain from philosophy. We shall not,  however, follow this track, but return to our original problem as soon  as we have cleared up the subject of dream-disfigurement. The question  has arisen how dreams with disagreeable content can be analyzed as the  fulfillment of wishes. We see now that this is possible in case  dream-disfigurement has taken place, in case the disagreeable content  serves only as a disguise for what is wished. Keeping in mind our  assumptions in regard to the two psychic instances, we may now proceed  to say: disagreeable dreams, as a matter of fact, contain something  which is disagreeable to the second instance, but which at the same time  fulfills a wish of the first instance. They are wish dreams in the sense  that every dream originates in the first instance, while the second  instance acts towards the dream only in repelling, not in a creative  manner. If we limit ourselves to a consideration of what the second  instance contributes to the dream, we can never understand the dream. If  we do so, all the riddles which the authors have found in the dream  remain unsolved.    That the dream actually has a secret meaning, which turns out to be the  fulfillment of a wish, must be proved afresh for every case by means of  an analysis. I therefore select several dreams which have painful  contents and attempt an analysis of them. They are partly dreams of  hysterical subjects, which require long preliminary statements, and now  and then also an examination of the psychic processes which occur in  hysteria. I cannot, however, avoid this added difficulty in the  exposition.    When I give a psychoneurotic patient analytical treatment, dreams are  always, as I have said, the subject of our discussion. It must,  therefore, give him all the psychological explanations through whose aid  I myself have come to an understanding of his symptoms, and here I  undergo an unsparing criticism, which is perhaps not less keen than that  I must expect from my colleagues. Contradiction of the thesis that all  dreams are the fulfillments of wishes is raised by my patients with  perfect regularity. Here are several examples of the dream material  which is offered me to refute this position.    \"You always tell me that the dream is a wish fulfilled,\" begins a clever  lady patient. \"Now I shall tell you a dream in which the content is  quite the opposite, in which a wish of mine is _not_ fulfilled. How do  you reconcile that with your theory? The dream is as follows:--    _\"I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smoked  salmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sunday  afternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone to  some caterers, but the telephone is out of order.... Thus I must resign  my wish to give a supper.\"_    I answer, of course, that only the analysis can decide the meaning of  this dream, although I admit that at first sight it seems sensible and  coherent, and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfillment. \"But what  occurrence has given rise to this dream?\" I ask. \"You know that the  stimulus for a dream always lies among the experiences of the preceding  day.\"    _Analysis._--The husband of the patient, an upright and conscientious  wholesale butcher, had told her the day before that he is growing too  fat, and that he must, therefore, begin treatment for obesity. He was  going to get up early, take exercise, keep to a strict diet, and above  all accept no more invitations to suppers. She proceeds laughingly to  relate how her husband at an inn table had made the acquaintance of an  artist, who insisted upon painting his portrait because he, the painter,  had never found such an expressive head. But her husband had answered in  his rough way, that he was very thankful for the honor, but that he was  quite convinced that a portion of the backside of a pretty young girl  would please the artist better than his whole face[1]. She said that she  was at the time very much in love with her husband, and teased him a  good deal. She had also asked him not to send her any caviare. What does  that mean?    As a matter of fact, she had wanted for a long time to eat a caviare  sandwich every forenoon, but had grudged herself the expense. Of course,  she would at once get the caviare from her husband, as soon as she asked  him for it. But she had begged him, on the contrary, not to send her the  caviare, in order that she might tease him about it longer.    This explanation seems far-fetched to me. Unadmitted motives are in the  habit of hiding behind such unsatisfactory explanations. We are reminded  of subjects hypnotized by Bernheim, who carried out a posthypnotic  order, and who, upon being asked for their motives, instead of  answering: \"I do not know why I did that,\" had to invent a reason that  was obviously inadequate. Something similar is probably the case with  the caviare of my patient. I see that she is compelled to create an  unfulfilled wish in life. Her dream also shows the reproduction of the  wish as accomplished. But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?    The ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of the  dream. I beg for more. After a short pause, which corresponds to the  overcoming of a resistance, she reports further that the day before she  had made a visit to a friend, of whom she is really jealous, because her  husband is always praising this woman so much. Fortunately, this friend  is very lean and thin, and her husband likes well-rounded figures. Now  of what did this lean friend speak? Naturally of her wish to become  somewhat stouter. She also asked my patient: \"When are you going to  invite us again? You always have such a good table.\"    Now the meaning of the dream is clear. I may say to the patient: \"It is  just as though you had thought at the time of the request: 'Of course,  I'll invite you, so you can eat yourself fat at my house and become  still more pleasing to my husband. I would rather give no more suppers.'  The dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, thereby  fulfilling your wish not to contribute anything to the rounding out of  your friend's figure. The resolution of your husband to refuse  invitations to supper for the sake of getting thin teaches you that one  grows fat on the things served in company.\" Now only some conversation  is necessary to confirm the solution. The smoked salmon in the dream has  not yet been traced. \"How did the salmon mentioned in the dream occur to  you?\" \"Smoked salmon is the favorite dish of this friend,\" she answered.  I happen to know the lady, and may corroborate this by saying that she  grudges herself the salmon just as much as my patient grudges herself  the caviare.    The dream admits of still another and more exact interpretation, which  is necessitated only by a subordinate circumstance. The two  interpretations do not contradict one another, but rather cover each  other and furnish a neat example of the usual ambiguity of dreams as  well as of all other psychopathological formations. We have seen that at  the same time that she dreams of the denial of the wish, the patient is  in reality occupied in securing an unfulfilled wish (the caviare  sandwiches). Her friend, too, had expressed a wish, namely, to get  fatter, and it would not surprise us if our lady had dreamt that the  wish of the friend was not being fulfilled. For it is her own wish that  a wish of her friend's--for increase in weight--should not be fulfilled.  Instead of this, however, she dreams that one of her own wishes is not  fulfilled. The dream becomes capable of a new interpretation, if in the  dream she does not intend "]]]
