But on another day, soon after, he had a fright that left him trembling  also for an hour. He had seized the cord to darken the window over the  seat in which he had found the harp-bag, and was standing with his back  well protected in the embrasure, when he thought he saw the tail of a  black-and-white check skirt disappear round the corner of the house. He  could not be sure--had he run to the window of the other wall, which was  blinded, the skirt must have been already past--but he was _almost_ sure  that it was Elsie. He listened in an agony of suspense for her tread on  the stairs....    But no tread came, and after three or four minutes he drew a long breath  of relief.    \"By Jove, but that would have compromised me horribly!\" he muttered....    And he continued to mutter from time to time, \"Horribly  compromising ... _no_ woman would stand that ... not _any_ kind of  woman ... oh, compromising in the extreme!\"    Yet he was not happy. He could not have assigned the cause of the fits of  quiet weeping which took him sometimes; they came and went, like the  fitful illumination of the clouds that travelled over the square; and  perhaps, after all, if he was not happy, he was not unhappy. Before  he could be unhappy something must have been withdrawn, and nothing had  yet been withdrawn from him, for nothing had been granted. He was waiting  for that granting, in that flower-laden, frightfully enticing apartment  of his, with the pith-white walls tinged and subdued by the crimson  blinds to a blood-like gloom.    He paid no heed to it that his stock of money was running perilously low,  nor that he had ceased to work. Ceased to work? He had not ceased to  work. They knew very little about it who supposed that Oleron had ceased  to work! He was in truth only now beginning to work. He was preparing  such a work ... such a work ... such a Mistress was a-making in the  gestation of his Art ... let him but get this period of probation and  poignant waiting over and men should see.... How _should_ men know her,  this Fair One of Oleron's, until Oleron himself knew her? Lovely radiant  creations are not thrown off like How-d'ye-do's. The men to whom it is  committed to father them must weep wretched tears, as Oleron did, must  swell with vain presumptuous hopes, as Oleron did, must pursue, as Oleron  pursued, the capricious, fair, mocking, slippery, eager Spirit that, ever  eluding, ever sees to it that the chase does not slacken. Let Oleron but  hunt this Huntress a little longer... he would have her sparkling  and panting in his arms yet.... Oh no: they were very far from the truth  who supposed that Oleron had ceased to work!    And if all else was falling away from Oleron, gladly he was letting it  go. So do we all when our Fair Ones beckon. Quite at the beginning we  wink, and promise ourselves that we will put Her Ladyship through her  paces, neglect her for a day, turn her own jealous wiles against her,  flout and ignore her when she comes wheedling; perhaps there lurks within  us all the time a heartless sprite who is never fooled; but in the end  all falls away. She beckons, beckons, and all goes....    And so Oleron kept his strategic post within the frame of his bedroom  door, and watched, and waited, and smiled, with his finger on his  lips.... It was his duteous service, his worship, his troth-plighting,  all that he had ever known of Love. And when he found himself, as he now  and then did, hating the dead man Madley, and wishing that he had never  lived, he felt that that, too, was an acceptable service....    But, as he thus prepared himself, as it were, for a Marriage, and moped  and chafed more and more that the Bride made no sign, he made a discovery  that he ought to have made weeks before.    It was through a thought of the dead Madley that he made it. Since that  night when he had thought in his greenness that a little studied neglect  would bring the lovely Beckoner to her knees, and had made use of her own  jealousy to banish her, he had not set eyes on those fifteen discarded  chapters of _Romilly_. He had thrown them back into the window-seat,  forgotten their very existence. But his own jealousy of Madley put him in  mind of hers of her jilted rival of flesh and blood, and he remembered  them.... Fool that he had been! Had he, then, expected his Desire to  manifest herself while there still existed the evidence of his divided  allegiance? What, and she with a passion so fierce and centred that it  had not hesitated at the destruction, twice attempted, of her rival? Fool  that he had been!...    But if _that_ was all the pledge and sacrifice she required she should  have it--ah, yes, and quickly!    He took the manuscript from the window-seat, and brought it to the fire.    He kept his fire always burning now; the warmth brought out the last  vestige of odour of the flowers with which his room was banked. He did  not know what time it was; long since he had allowed his clock to run  down--it had seemed a foolish measurer of time in regard to the  stupendous things that were happening to Oleron; but he knew it was late.  He took the _Romilly_ manuscript and knelt before the fire.    But he had not finished removing the fastening that held the sheets  together before he suddenly gave a start, turned his head over his  shoulder, and listened intently. The sound he had heard had not been  loud--it had been, indeed, no more than a tap, twice or thrice  repeated--but it had filled Oleron with alarm. His face grew dark as  it came again.    He heard a voice outside on his landing.    \"Paul!... Paul!...\"    It was Elsie's voice.    \"Paul!... I know you're in... I want to see you....\"    He cursed her under his breath, but kept perfectly still. He did not  intend to admit her.    \"Paul!... You're in trouble.... I believe you're in danger... at least  come to the door!...\"    Oleron smothered a low laugh. It somehow amused him that she, in such  danger herself, should talk to him of _his_ danger!... Well, if she was,  serve her right; she knew, or said she knew, all about it....    \"Paul!... Paul!...\"    \"_Paul!... Paul!_...\" He mimicked her under his breath.    \"Oh, Paul, it's _horrible_!...\"    Horrible, was it? thought Oleron. Then let her get away....    \"I only want to help you, Paul.... I didn't promise not to come if you  needed me....\"    He was impervious to the pitiful sob that interrupted the low cry. The  devil take the woman! Should he shout to her to go away and not come  back? No: let her call and knock and sob. She had a gift for sobbing; she  mustn't think her sobs would move him. They irritated him, so that he set  his teeth and shook his fist at her, but that was all. Let her sob.    \"_Paul!... Paul!_...\"    With his teeth hard set, he dropped the first page of _Romilly_ into the  fire. Then he began to drop the rest in, sheet by sheet.    For many minutes the calling behind his door continued; then suddenly it  ceased. He heard the sound of feet slowly descending the stairs. He  listened for the noise of a fall or a cry or the crash of a piece of the  handrail of the upper landing; but none of these things came. She was  spared. Apparently her rival suffered her to crawl abject and beaten  away. Oleron heard the passing of her steps under his window; then she  was gone.    He dropped the last page into the fire, and then, with a low laugh rose.  He looked fondly round his room.    \"Lucky to get away like that,\" he remarked. \"She wouldn't have got away  if I'd given her as much as a word or a look! What devils these women  are!... But no; I oughtn't to say that; one of 'em showed  forbearance....\"    Who showed forbearance? And what was forborne? Ah, Oleron  knew!... Contempt, no doubt, had been at the bottom of it, but that  didn't matter: the pestering creature had been allowed to go unharmed.  Yes, she was lucky; Oleron hoped she knew it....    And now, now, now for his reward!    Oleron crossed the room. All his doors were open; his eyes shone as he  placed himself within that of his bedroom.    Fool that he had been, not to think of destroying the manuscript  sooner!...           *       *       *       *       *    How, in a houseful of shadows, should he know his own Shadow? How, in a  houseful of noises, distinguish the summons he felt to be at hand? Ah,  trust him! He would know! The place was full of a jugglery of dim lights.  The blind at his elbow that allowed the light of a street lamp to  struggle vaguely through--the glimpse of greeny blue moonlight seen  through the distant kitchen door--the sulky glow of the fire under the  black ashes of the burnt manuscript--the glimmering of the tulips and the  moon-daisies and narcissi in the bowls and jugs and jars--these did not  so trick and bewilder his eyes that he would not know his Own! It was he,  not she, who had been delaying the shadowy Bridal; he hung his head for a  moment in mute acknowledgment; then he bent his eyes on the deceiving,  puzzling gloom again. He would have called her name had he known it--but  now he would not ask her to share even a name with the other....    His own face, within the frame of the door, glimmered white as the  narcissi in the darkness....    A shadow, light as fleece, seemed to take shape in the kitchen (the time  had been when Oleron would have said that a cloud had passed over the  unseen moon). The low illumination on the blind at his elbow grew dimmer  (the time had been when Oleron would have concluded that the lamplighter  going his rounds had turned low the flame of the lamp). The fire settled,  letting down the black and charred papers; a flower fell from a bowl,  and lay indistinct upon the floor; all was still; and then a stray  draught moved through the old house, passing before Oleron's face....    Suddenly, inclining his head, he withdrew a little from the door-jamb.  The wandering draught caused the door to move a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#12)"],[1,"of the Fifth Sub-Division. It has taken the  race millions of years to reach this stage, and it will take many more  years for the race to move on to the sixth and seventh sub-divisions,  and beyond. But, remember, that there have been races before us which  have passed through these degrees, and then on to higher planes. Our own  race is the fifth (with stragglers from the fourth) which has set foot  upon The Path. And, then there are a few advanced souls of our own race  who have outstripped the masses, and who have passed on to the sixth and  seventh sub-division, and some few being still further on. The man of  the Sixth Sub-Division will be \"The Super-Man\"; he of the Seventh will  be \"The Over-Man.\"    In our consideration of the Seven Minor Mental Planes, we have merely  referred to the Three Elementary Planes in a general way. We do not wish  to go into this subject in detail in this work, for it does not belong  to this part of the general philosophy and teachings. But we may say  this much, in order to give you a little clearer idea, of the relations  of these planes to the more familiar ones--the Elementary Planes bear  the same relation to the Planes of Mineral, Plant, Animal and Human  Mentality and Life, that the black keys on the piano do to the white  keys. The white keys are sufficient to produce music, but there are  certain scales, melodies, and harmonies, in which the black keys play  their part, and in which their presence is necessary. They are also  necessary as \"connecting links\" of soul-condition; entity states, etc.,  between the several other planes, certain forms of development being  attained therein--this last fact giving to the reader who can \"read  between the lines\" a new light upon the processes of Evolution, and a  new key to the secret door of the \"leaps of life\" between kingdom and  kingdom.  The great kingdoms of Elementals are fully recognized by all  occultists, and the esoteric writings are full of mention of them.  The  readers of Bulwer's \"Sanoni\" and similar tales will recognize the  entities inhabiting these planes of life.    Passing on from the Great Mental Plane to the Great Spiritual Plane,  what shall we say? How can we explain these higher states of Being, Life  and Mind, to minds as yet unable to grasp and understand the higher  subdivisions of the Plane of Human Mind? The task is impossible. We can  speak only in the most general terms. How may Light be described to a  man born blind--how sugar, to a man who has never tasted anything  sweet--how harmony, to one born deaf?    All that we can say is that the Seven Minor Planes of the Great  Spiritual Plane (each Minor Plane having its seven sub-divisions)  comprise Beings possessing Life, Mind and Form as far above that of Man  of to-day as the latter is above the earth-worm, mineral or even certain  forms of Energy or Matter. The Life of these Beings so far transcends  ours, that we cannot even think of the details of the same; their minds  so far transcend ours, that to them we scarcely seem to \"think,\" and our  mental processes seem almost akin to material processes; the Matter of  which their forms are composed is of the highest Planes of Matter, nay,  some are even said to be \"clothed in Pure Energy.\" What may be said of  such Beings?    On the Seven Minor Planes of the Great Spiritual Plane exist Beings of  whom we may speak as Angels; Archangels; Demi-Gods. On the lower Minor  Planes dwell those great souls whom we call Masters and Adepts. Above  them come the Great Hierarchies of the Angelic Hosts, unthinkable to  man; and above those come those who may without irreverence be called  \"The Gods,\" so high in the scale of Being are they, their being,  intelligence and power being akin to those attributed by the races of  men to their conceptions of Deity. These Beings are beyond even the  highest flights of the human imagination, the word \"Divine\" being the  only one applicable to them. Many of these Beings, as well as the  Angelic Host, take the greatest interest in the affairs of the Universe  and play an important part in its affairs. These Unseen Divinities and  Angelic Helpers extend their influence freely and powerfully, in the  process of Evolution, and Cosmic Progress. Their occasional intervention  and assistance in human affairs have led to the many legends, beliefs,  religions and traditions of the race, past and present. They have  superimposed their knowledge and power upon the world, again and again,  all under the Law of THE ALL, of course.    But, yet, even the highest of these advanced Beings exist merely as  creations of, and in, the Mind of THE ALL, and are subject to the Cosmic  Processes and Universal Laws. They are still Mortal. We may call them  \"gods\" if we like, but still they are but the Elder Brethren of the  Race,--the advanced souls who have outstripped their brethren, and who  have foregone the ecstasy of Absorption by THE ALL, in order to help the  race on its upward journey along The Path. But, they belong to the  Universe, and are subject to its conditions--they are mortal--and their  plane is below that of Absolute Spirit.    Only the most advanced Hermetists are able to grasp the Inner Teachings  regarding the state of existence, and the powers manifested on the  Spiritual Planes. The phenomena is so much higher than that of the  Mental Planes that a confusion of ideas would surely result from an  attempt to describe the same. Only those whose minds have been carefully  trained along the lines of the Hermetic Philosophy for years--yes, those  who have brought with them from other incarnations the knowledge  acquired previously--can comprehend just what is meant by the Teaching  regarding these Spiritual Planes. And much of these Inner Teachings is  held by the Hermetists as being too sacred, important and even dangerous  for general public dissemination. The intelligent student may recognize  what we mean by this when we state that the meaning of \"Spirit\" as used  by the Hermetists is akin to \"Living Power\"; \"Animated Force;\" \"Inner  Essence;\" \"Essence of Life,\" etc., which meaning must not be confounded  with that usually and commonly employed in connection with the term,  i.e., \"religious; ecclesiastical; spiritual; ethereal; holy,\" etc., etc.  To occultists the word \"Spirit\" is used in the sense of \"The Animating  Principle,\" carrying with it the idea of Power, Living Energy, Mystic  Force, etc. And occultists know that that which is known to them as  \"Spiritual Power\" may be employed for evil as well as good ends (in  accordance with the Principle of Polarity), a fact which has been  recognized by the majority of religions in their conceptions of Satan,  Beelzebub, the Devil, Lucifer, Fallen Angels, etc. And so the knowledge  regarding these Planes has been kept in the Holy of Holies in all  Esoteric Fraternities and Occult Orders,--in the Secret Chamber of the  Temple. But this may be said here, that those who have attained high  spiritual powers and have misused them, have a terrible fate in store  for them, and the swing of the pendulum of Rhythm will inevitably swing  them back to the furthest extreme of Material existence, from which  point they must retrace their steps Spiritward, along the weary rounds  of The Path, but always with the added torture of having always with  them a lingering memory of the heights from which they fell owing to  their evil actions. The legends of the Fallen Angels have a basis in  actual facts, as all advanced occultists know. The striving for selfish  power on the Spiritual Planes inevitably results in the selfish soul  losing its spiritual balance and falling back as far as it had  previously risen. But to even such a soul, the opportunity of a return  is given--and such souls make the return journey, paying the terrible  penalty according to the invariable Law.    In conclusion we would again remind you that according to the Principle  of Correspondence, which embodies the truth: \"As Above so Below; as  Below, so Above,\" all of the Seven Hermetic Principles are in full  operation on all of the many planes, Physical Mental and Spiritual. The  Principle of Mental Substance of course applies to all the planes, for  all are held in the Mind of THE ALL. The Principle of Correspondence  manifests in all, for there is a correspondence, harmony and agreement  between the several planes. The Principle of Vibration manifests on all  planes, in fact the very differences that go to make the \"planes\" arise  from Vibration, as we have explained. The Principle of Polarity  manifests on each plane, the extremes of the Poles being apparently  opposite and contradictory. The Principle of Rhythm manifests on each  Plane, the movement of the phenomena having its ebb and flow, rise and  flow, incoming and outgoing. The Principle of Cause and Effect manifests  on each Plane, every Effect having its Cause and every Cause having its  effect. The Principle of Gender manifests on each Plane, the Creative  Energy being always manifest, and operating along the lines of its  Masculine and Feminine Aspects.    \"As Above so Below; as Below, so Above.\" This centuries old Hermetic  axiom embodies one of the great Principles of Universal Phenomena. As we  proceed with our consideration of the remaining Principles, we will see  even more clearly the truth of the universal nature of this great  Principle of Correspondence.        CHAPTER IX    VIBRATION        \"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything      vibrates.\"--The Kybalion.    The great Third Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Vibration--embodies  the truth that Motion is manifest in everything in the Universe--that  nothing is at rest--that everything moves, vibrates, and circles. This  Hermetic Principle was recognized by some of the early Greek philosophers  who embodied it in their systems. But, then, for centuries it was lost  sight of by the thinkers outside of the Hermetic ranks. But in the "]]]
