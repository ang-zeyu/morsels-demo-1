[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#12)"],[1,"at the typed and signed statement to the effect that Carl  Gwinnett agreed to pay the sum of fifteen thousand dollars for the Lane  Fleming pistol-collection, in its entirety, within thirty days of date.  That was an average of six dollars a pistol. There had been a time, not  too long ago, when a pistol-collection with an average value of six  dollars, particularly one as large as the Fleming collection, had been  something unusual. For one thing, arms values had increased sharply in  the meantime. For another, Lane Fleming had kept his collection clean of  the two-dollar items which dragged down so many collectors' average  values. Except for the two-dozen-odd mysterious interlopers, there wasn't  a pistol in the Fleming collection that wasn't worth at least twenty  dollars, and quite a few had values expressible in three figures.    \"Well, your offer is duly received and filed, Mr. Gwinnett,\" Rand told  him, folding the sheet and putting it in his pocket. \"This is better  than an unwitnessed verbal statement that somebody is willing to pay  twenty-five thousand. I'll certainly bear you in mind.\"    \"You can show that to Arnold Rivers, if you want to,\" Gwinnett said. \"See  how much he's willing to commit himself to, over his signature.\"          CHAPTER 8      Pre-dinner cocktails in the library seemed to be a sort of household  rite--a self-imposed Truce of Bacchus before the resumption of  hostilities in the dining-room. It lasted from six forty-five to seven;  everybody sipped Manhattans and kept quiet and listened to the radio  newscast. The only new face, to Rand, was Fred Dunmore's.    It was a smooth, pinkly-shaven face, decorated with octagonal rimless  glasses; an entirely unremarkable face; the face of the type that used to  be labeled \"Babbitt.\" The corner of Rand's mind that handled such data  subconsciously filed his description: forty-five to fifty, one-eighty,  five feet eight, hair brown and thinning, eyes blue. To this he added the  Rotarian button on the lapel, and the small gold globule on the watch  chain that testified that, when his age and weight had been considerably  less, Dunmore had played on somebody's basketball team. At that time he  had probably belonged to the Y.M.C.A., and had thought that Mussolini was  doing a splendid job in Italy, that H. L. Mencken ought to be deported to  Russia, and that Prohibition was here to stay. At company sales meetings,  he probably radiated an aura of synthetic good-fellowship.    As Rand followed Walters down the spiral from the gunroom, the radio  commercial was just starting, and Geraldine was asking Dunmore where  Anton was.    \"Oh, you know,\" Dunmore told her, impatiently. \"He had to go to  Louisburg, to that Medical Association meeting; he's reading a paper  about the new diabetic ration.\"    He broke off as Rand approached and was introduced by Gladys, who handed  both men their cocktails. Then the news commentator greeted them out of  the radio, and everybody absorbed the day's news along with their  Manhattans. After the broadcast, they all crossed the hall to the  dining-room, where hostilities began almost before the soup was cool  enough to taste.    \"I don't see why you women had to do this,\" Dunmore huffed. \"Rivers has  made us a fair offer. Bringing in an outsider will only give him the  impression that we lack confidence in him.\"    \"Well, won't that be just too, too bad!\" Geraldine slashed at him. \"We  mustn't ever hurt dear Mr. Rivers's feelings like that. Let him have the  collection for half what it's worth, but never, never let him think we  know what a God-damned crook he is!\"    Dunmore evidently didn't think that worth dignifying with an answer.  Doubtless he expected Nelda to launch a counter-offensive, as a matter of  principle. If he did, he was disappointed.    \"Well?\" Nelda demanded. \"What did you want us to do; give the collection  away?\"    \"You don't understand,\" Dunmore told her. \"You've probably heard somebody  say what the collection's worth, and you never stopped to realize that  it's only worth that to a dealer, who can sell it item by item. You can't  expect ...\"    \"We can expect a lot more than ten thousand dollars,\" Nelda retorted. \"In  fact, we can expect more than that from Rivers. Colonel Rand was talking  to Rivers, this afternoon. Colonel Rand doesn't have any confidence in  Rivers at all, and he doesn't care who knows it.\"    \"You were talking to Arnold Rivers, this afternoon, about the  collection?\" Dunmore demanded of Rand.    \"That's right,\" Rand confirmed. \"I told him his ten thousand dollar offer  was a joke. Stephen Gresham and his friends can top that out of one  pocket. Finally, he got around to admitting that he's willing to pay up  to twenty-five thousand.\"    \"I don't believe it!\" Dunmore exclaimed angrily. \"Rivers told me  personally, that neither he nor any other dealer could hope to handle  that collection profitably at more than ten thousand.\"    \"And you believed that?\" Nelda demanded. \"And you're a business man? _My  God!_\"    \"He's probably a good one, as long as he sticks to pancake flour,\"  Geraldine was generous enough to concede. \"But about guns, he barely  knows which end the bullet comes out at. Ten thousand was probably his  idea of what we'd think the pistols were worth.\"    Dunmore ignored that and turned to Rand. \"Did Arnold Rivers actually tell  you he'd pay twenty-five thousand dollars for the collection?\" he asked.  \"I can't believe that he'd raise his own offer like that.\"    \"He didn't raise his offer; I threw it out and told him to make one that  could be taken seriously.\" Rand repeated, as closely as he could, his  conversation with the arms-dealer. When he had finished, Dunmore was  frowning in puzzled displeasure.    \"And you think he's actually willing to pay that much?\"    \"Yes, I do. If he handles them right, he can double his money on the  pistols inside of five years. I doubt if you realize how valuable those  pistols are. You probably defined Mr. Fleming's collection as a 'hobby'  and therefore something not to be taken seriously. And, aside from the  actual profit, the prestige of handling this collection would be worth  a good deal to Rivers, as advertising. I haven't the least doubt that he  can raise the money, or that he's willing to pay it.\"    Dunmore was still frowning. Maybe he hated being proved wrong in front of  the women of the family.    \"And you think Gresham and his friends will offer enough to force him to  pay the full amount?\"    Rand laughed and told him to stop being naive. \"He's done that, himself,  and what's more, he knows it. When he told me he was willing to go as  high as twenty-five thousand, he fixed the price. Unless somebody offers  more, which isn't impossible.\"    \"But maybe he's just bluffing.\" Dunmore seemed to be following Gwinnett's  line of thought. \"After he's bluffed Gresham's crowd out, maybe he'll go  back to his original ten thousand offer.\"    \"Fred, please stop talking about that ten thousand dollars!\" Geraldine  interrupted. \"How much did Rivers actually tell you he'd pay? Twenty-five  thousand, like he did Colonel Rand?\"    Dunmore turned in his chair angrily. \"Now, look here!\" he shouted.  \"There's a limit to what I've got to take from you....\"    He stopped short, as Nelda, beside him, moved slightly, and his words  ended in something that sounded like a smothered moan. Rand suspected  that she had kicked her husband painfully under the table. Then Walters  came in with the meat course, and firing ceased until the butler had  retired.    \"By the way,\" Rand tossed into the conversational vacuum that followed  his exit, \"does anybody know anything about a record Mr. Fleming kept of  his collection?\"    \"Why, no; can't say I do,\" Dunmore replied promptly, evidently grateful  for the change of subject. \"You mean, like an inventory?\"    \"Oh, Fred, you do!\" Nelda told him impatiently. \"You know that big gray  book Father kept all his pistols entered in.\"    \"It was a gray ledger, with a black leather back,\" Gladys said. \"He kept  it in the little bookcase over the workbench in the gunroom.\"    \"I'll look for it,\" Rand said. \"Sure it's still there? It would be a big  help to me.\"    The rest of the dinner passed in relative tranquillity. The conversation  proceeded in fairly safe channels. Dunmore was anxious to avoid any  further reference to the sum of ten thousand dollars; when Gladys induced  Rand to talk about his military experiences, he lapsed into preoccupied  silence. Several times, Geraldine and Nelda aimed halfhearted feline  swipes at one another, more out of custom than present and active  rancor. The women seemed to have erected a temporary tri-partite  _Entente_-more-or-less-_Cordiale_.    Finally, the meal ended, and the diners drifted away from the table. Rand  went to his room for a few moments, then went to the gunroom to get the  notes he had made. Fred Dunmore was using the private phone as he  entered.    \"Well, never mind about that, now,\" he was saying. \"We'll talk about  it when I see you.... Yes, of course; so am I.... Well, say about  eleven.... Be seeing you.\"    He hung up and turned to Rand. \"More God-damned union trouble,\" he said.  \"It's enough to make a saint lose his religion! Our factory-hands are  organized in the C.I.O., and our warehouse, sales, and shipping personnel  are in the A.F. of L., and if they aren't fighting the company, they're  fighting each other. Now they have some damn kind of a jurisdictional  dispute.... I don't know what this country's coming to!\" He glared  angrily through his octagonal glasses for a moment. Then his voice took  on an ingratiating note. \"Look here, Colonel; I just didn't understand  the situation, until you explained it. I hope you aren't taking anything  that sister-in-law of mine said seriously. She just blurts out the first  thing that comes into her so-called mind; why, only yesterday she was  accusing Gladys of bringing you into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#12)"],[1,"of  reward.    Reply Obj. 2: The very sight of God causes delight. Consequently, he  who sees God cannot need delight.    Reply Obj. 3: Delight that is attendant upon the operation of the  intellect does not hinder it, rather does it perfect it, as stated in  _Ethic._ x, 4: since what we do with delight, we do with greater care  and perseverance. On the other hand, delight which is extraneous to  the operation is a hindrance thereto: sometimes by distracting the  attention because, as already observed, we are more attentive to  those things that delight us; and when we are very attentive to one  thing, we must needs be less attentive to another: sometimes on  account of opposition; thus a sensual delight that is contrary to  reason, hinders the estimate of prudence more than it hinders the  estimate of the speculative intellect.  ________________________    SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 2]    Whether in Happiness Vision Ranks Before Delight?    Objection 1: It would seem that in happiness, delight ranks before  vision. For \"delight is the perfection of operation\" (Ethic. x, 4).  But perfection ranks before the thing perfected. Therefore delight  ranks before the operation of the intellect, i.e. vision.    Obj. 2: Further, that by reason of which a thing is desirable, is yet  more desirable. But operations are desired on account of the delight  they afford: hence, too, nature has adjusted delight to those  operations which are necessary for the preservation of the individual  and of the species, lest animals should disregard such operations.  Therefore, in happiness, delight ranks before the operation of the  intellect, which is vision.    Obj. 3: Further, vision corresponds to faith; while delight or  enjoyment corresponds to charity. But charity ranks before faith, as  the Apostle says (1 Cor. 13:13). Therefore delight or enjoyment ranks  before vision.    _On the contrary,_ The cause is greater than its effect. But vision  is the cause of delight. Therefore vision ranks before delight.    _I answer that,_ The Philosopher discusses this question (Ethic. x,  4), and leaves it unsolved. But if one consider the matter carefully,  the operation of the intellect which is vision, must needs rank  before delight. For delight consists in a certain repose of the will.  Now that the will finds rest in anything, can only be on account of  the goodness of that thing in which it reposes. If therefore the will  reposes in an operation, the will's repose is caused by the goodness  of the operation. Nor does the will seek good for the sake of repose;  for thus the very act of the will would be the end, which has been  disproved above (Q. 1, A. 1, ad 2;Q. 3, A. 4): but it seeks to be at  rest in the operation, because that operation is its good.  Consequently it is evident that the operation in which the will  reposes ranks before the resting of the will therein.    Reply Obj. 1: As the Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) \"delight perfects  operation as vigor perfects youth,\" because it is a result of youth.  Consequently delight is a perfection attendant upon vision; but not a  perfection whereby vision is made perfect in its own species.    Reply Obj. 2: The apprehension of the senses does not attain to the  universal good, but to some particular good which is delightful. And  consequently, according to the sensitive appetite which is in  animals, operations are sought for the sake of delight. But the  intellect apprehends the universal good, the attainment of which  results in delight: wherefore its purpose is directed to good rather  than to delight. Hence it is that the Divine intellect, which is the  Author of nature, adjusted delights to operations on account of the  operations. And we should form our estimate of things not simply  according to the order of the sensitive appetite, but rather  according to the order of the intellectual appetite.    Reply Obj. 3: Charity does not seek the beloved good for the sake of  delight: it is for charity a consequence that it delights in the good  gained which it loves. Thus delight does not answer to charity as its  end, but vision does, whereby the end is first made present to  charity.  ________________________    THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 3]    Whether Comprehension Is Necessary for Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that comprehension is not necessary for  happiness. For Augustine says (Ad Paulinam de Videndo Deum; [*Cf.  Serm. xxxciii De Verb. Dom.]): \"To reach God with the mind is  happiness, to comprehend Him is impossible.\" Therefore happiness is  without comprehension.    Obj. 2: Further, happiness is the perfection of man as to his  intellective part, wherein there are no other powers than the  intellect and will, as stated in the First Part (QQ. 79 and  following). But the intellect is sufficiently perfected by seeing  God, and the will by enjoying Him. Therefore there is no need for  comprehension as a third.    Obj. 3: Further, happiness consists in an operation. But operations  are determined by their objects: and there are two universal objects,  the true and the good: of which the true corresponds to vision, and  good to delight. Therefore there is no need for comprehension as a  third.    _On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (1 Cor. 9:24): \"So run that you  may comprehend [Douay: 'obtain'].\" But happiness is the goal of the  spiritual race: hence he says (2 Tim. 4:7, 8): \"I have fought a good  fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; as to the  rest there is laid up for me a crown of justice.\" Therefore  comprehension is necessary for Happiness.    _I answer that,_ Since Happiness consists in gaining the last end,  those things that are required for Happiness must be gathered from  the way in which man is ordered to an end. Now man is ordered to an  intelligible end partly through his intellect, and partly through his  will: through his intellect, in so far as a certain imperfect  knowledge of the end pre-exists in the intellect: through the will,  first by love which is the will's first movement towards anything;  secondly, by a real relation of the lover to the thing beloved, which  relation may be threefold. For sometimes the thing beloved is present  to the lover: and then it is no longer sought for. Sometimes it is  not present, and it is impossible to attain it: and then, too, it is  not sought for. But sometimes it is possible to attain it, yet it is  raised above the capability of the attainer, so that he cannot have  it forthwith; and this is the relation of one that hopes, to that  which he hopes for, and this relation alone causes a search for the  end. To these three, there are a corresponding three in Happiness  itself. For perfect knowledge of the end corresponds to imperfect  knowledge; presence of the end corresponds to the relation of hope;  but delight in the end now present results from love, as already  stated (A. 2, ad 3). And therefore these three must concur with  Happiness; to wit, vision, which is perfect knowledge of the  intelligible end; comprehension, which implies presence of the end;  and delight or enjoyment, which implies repose of the lover in the  object beloved.    Reply Obj. 1: Comprehension is twofold. First, inclusion of the  comprehended in the comprehensor; and thus whatever is comprehended  by the finite, is itself finite. Wherefore God cannot be thus  comprehended by a created intellect. Secondly, comprehension means  nothing but the holding of something already present and possessed:  thus one who runs after another is said to comprehend [*In English we  should say 'catch.'] him when he lays hold on him. And in this sense  comprehension is necessary for Happiness.    Reply Obj. 2: Just as hope and love pertain to the will, because it  is the same one that loves a thing, and that tends towards it while  not possessed, so, too, comprehension and delight belong to the will,  since it is the same that possesses a thing and reposes therein.    Reply Obj. 3: Comprehension is not a distinct operation from vision;  but a certain relation to the end already gained. Wherefore even  vision itself, or the thing seen, inasmuch as it is present, is the  object of comprehension.  ________________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 4]    Whether Rectitude of the Will Is Necessary for Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that rectitude of the will is not  necessary for Happiness. For Happiness consists essentially in an  operation of the intellect, as stated above (Q. 3, A. 4). But  rectitude of the will, by reason of which men are said to be clean of  heart, is not necessary for the perfect operation of the intellect:  for Augustine says (Retract. i, 4) \"I do not approve of what I said  in a prayer: O God, Who didst will none but the clean of heart to  know the truth. For it can be answered that many who are not clean of  heart, know many truths.\" Therefore rectitude of the will is not  necessary for Happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, what precedes does not depend on what follows. But  the operation of the intellect precedes the operation of the will.  Therefore Happiness, which is the perfect operation of the intellect,  does not depend on rectitude of the will.    Obj. 3: Further, that which is ordained to another as its end, is not  necessary, when the end is already gained; as a ship, for instance,  after arrival in port. But rectitude of will, which is by reason of  virtue, is ordained to Happiness as to its end. Therefore, Happiness  once obtained, rectitude of the will is no longer necessary.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Matt. 5:8): \"Blessed are the clean  of heart; for they shall see God\": and (Heb. 12:14): \"Follow peace  with all men, and holiness; without which no man shall see God.\"    _I answer that,_ Rectitude of will is necessary for Happiness both  antecedently and concomitantly. Antecedently, because rectitude of  the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end."]]]
