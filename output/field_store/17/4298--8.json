Again, they pretended Jan was a big bear and he found it  great fun to chase after the children while they ran away as though  really afraid of him. Then it was \"Little Red Riding Hood\" with Jan for  the wolf, but he did not eat any one, like the wolf did, for he knew he  would have a nice piece of meat cooked over the wood fire as they all  sat about on the ground and pretended they had no place to sleep  excepting underneath the trees. When the stars began to twinkle, the  sunbonnet children said that the angels were lighting the candles in  Heaven, and very soon it was time to go home for the night.    Haying time in California is different from that of other parts of the  world, for it is in May, and many months ahead of other places. The  fields were dotted with little mounds of yellow hay drying in the sun,  and one evening Mrs. Melville told the children she had a new game for  the Land of Make-Believe. The next afternoon they could hardly wait  until they reached the hay-fields.    \"Now, children,\" said their mother, \"these are the snow-covered peaks of  the Alps that I told you about. Ruth must be a lost traveller and wander  around among these mountains of snow until she is too tired to go any  further. Then she must lie down and pull the hay over her and wait to be  rescued from death in the snow.\"    As Ruth scampered away, Jan followed her, but Mrs. Melville called him  back. He sat looking at her, but his head turned frequently toward the  place he had last seen little Ruth. Several times he started to get up,  but each time he sat down again and waited.    \"You, Charlotte, are a monk from the Hospice and Bruin will go with you  to search for lost travellers in this terrible snow-storm.\"    Jan stood very still, but his tail flapped around in circles while Mrs.  Melville fastened a canteen of water to his collar, then she said,  \"Now, Bruin, go find Ruth!\"    \"Woof! Woof!\" rang out the big voice, just as the dogs of the Hospice  called when they started on the trail. Followed closely by Charlotte,  Jan led the way from one hay mound to another, poking his nose deeply  into each. Charlotte kept calling, \"Find Ruth, Bruin! Go find her! She's  lost in the snow and will freeze to death if we don't find her soon!\"    Jan forgot it was only the Land of Make-Believe, while he burrowed into  the haycocks. As he ran from one to the other, his bark sounded again  and again, for he remembered the lessons Brother Antoine had given him  and Rollo, and the canteen that bumped against his breast felt like the  little wooden casket he had carried on the trail. At last he found the  lost traveller. Jan lifted his head and uttered a sharp bark of triumph  before his nose began tossing the hay that completely covered Ruth.    \"He found her! He found her!\" shrieked Charlotte in greatest excitement,  just as though Ruth had really been lost in the snow-drifts.    Both parents ran to watch the game and Ruth's face appeared in the hay,  like a pink Easter egg in a nest. She squinted up, saw her mother and  father, Charlotte and Jan, then remembered that she was lost and shut  her eyes quickly. Jan touched her cheek with his nose, and licked her  face. She could not keep still any longer, because she wanted to sneeze  and that would spoil the whole game. So she opened her eyes, put up her  hand and unfastened the canteen from Jan's collar and swallowed such a  big gulp of water that she almost choked. Her arms went about Jan's neck  and while she clung, he moved slowly away from the mound, his tail  waving rapidly and his big eyes full of pride. Ruth had been saved from  a terrible death in the snow-drifts of the Alps!    The whole party of rescuers hastened to the Hospice under the trees,  where supper was almost ready, and as they sat around the outdoor  fireplace waiting the meal, they all declared that Bruin had acted just  as if he had really lived at the Hospice and knew all about the dogs  there and how they worked.    Three months after Jan went to live at Roseneath, the family sat reading  one evening, and Jan sprawled at their feet. Ruth and Charlotte were  deeply interested in the pictures of a new magazine for children, and  Mr. Melville held a newspaper. He had been to the nearest town that day  and had brought the mail home with him.    Suddenly he let the paper drop to his lap and sat looking at Prince Jan,  then he picked up the paper again, saying, \"Listen to this!\"    All of them turned expectantly, for the parents always read aloud  anything that might interest the children.        CAPTURED THIEF WORRIES OVER LOST DOG        John Leavitt, alias Shorty, now held as one of the two men who stole      and wrecked an automobile belonging to Paul E. Wallace of Los      Angeles, has made a confession implicating his half-brother, William      Leavitt, formerly stableman at the beach-home of the Pixleys.        According to Shorty's statement, they had stolen a St. Bernard dog      from Captain Smith, the Poundmaster, intending to sell the animal in      Canada. Shorty became attached to the dog, Prince Jan, and in a      quarrel with his brother over the muzzling of the dog, the machine      was wrecked.        Leavitt evidently supposed Shorty was dead beneath the wreckage, and      escaped. Shorty was found later, seriously injured, and his recovery      was not expected. His one anxiety seems to be that Prince Jan, being      muzzled, might have died of starvation. Any one knowing the fate of      the dog is asked to communicate with Captain Smith, through this      paper.        Prince Jan is a pure St. Bernard, with long fur, but he had been      clipped and his hair dyed black.        No trace of William Leavitt has been found, but the authorities are      looking for him. He has a criminal record in the East and is now      wanted there. Shorty has been bound over for trial.    The family looked at the dog sleeping peacefully at their feet.    \"Not the least doubt,\" said Mr. Melville.    \"Call him, Ruth. Call his name--Prince Jan--and see how he acts.\"    The child's lips quivered and her eyes filled with tears as she went to  her mother's side. \"But, mother, if he is Prince Jan, will somebody take  him away from us?\"    Charlotte's eyes, too, were blurred and her lower lip dropped.    \"Suppose,\" the mother spoke gently, and her arm went about the slender  little figure leaning against her in half-choked grief, \"Suppose, dear,  some one found you when you were lost, and daddy and I didn't know where  you were, and the people couldn't understand when you tried to tell them  who you were and where we lived,\" the voice grew very tender and grave,  \"and then the people found out where you belonged and that we were  looking everywhere for you, and grieving because we did not know whether  you were hungry and unhappy. Do you think it would be right for them to  keep you away from us, even if they did love you very, very dearly?\"    Ruth's head hung low and nobody spoke until she lifted her face with a  tear-wet smile, \"Jan! Prince Jan!\" she called in her high, sweet voice.    They saw the muscles of the sleeping dog twitch. The big paws moved  slightly, as though in his dreams he was running to answer that name.  His tail threshed lightly on the floor, but still he slept.    \"Jan, Prince Jan!\" both children now called.    He leaped to his feet. Quivering with excitement he faced them.    \"Jan!\" repeated Mr. Melville.    The dog darted to the man's side and stood with eager, expectant eyes  and furiously switching tail. When he heard the name from Mrs. Melville,  Jan ran to her and laid his head on her knee, looking into her face  questioning her dumbly.    \"He knows his name! He is Prince Jan!\" the children cried as they  swooped down on him with squeezes and hugs, while the dog whined and  twisted and uttered sharp barks of excitement until they were all  laughing at him.    \"Do you want to go home to the captain, Jan?\" Mrs. Melville leaned over  him as she spoke.    \"Woof! Woof!\" he answered promptly, and they all knew that he meant  \"Yes.\"    So Mr. Melville got pen and ink and wrote to the poundmaster, telling  that Prince Jan was safe and well, and that he, himself, would bring the  dog home.    That was how Prince Jan came back to the captain and Hippity-Hop, at  last. He was very happy at going home, yet he looked back wistfully at  Ruth and Charlotte standing on the porch waving their hands, as the  automobile drove away from the Land of Make-Believe, where Jan had been  so kindly treated. But when he saw the ocean again and the road up the  bluff and knew that he was near the bungalow, he was ready to leap from  the machine and dash madly to the place where the captain, Hippity-Hop,  and Cheepsie lived. He knew then that he loved them more than anybody in  the whole world.          Chapter XI    PRINCE JAN VISITS SHORTY      Jan reached the front gate and let out a ringing \"Woof\" of joy that  brought the captain and Hippity-Hop out at once. The old man's arms went  about Jan's neck, and the dog gave little whines of delight, his tongue  touched the wrinkled hands, and his tail went around so fast that it did  not look like a tail, but just a blur of fuzzy hair.    When Mr. Melville was seated, and the Captain on a chair near by, Jan's  head rested on the old man's knee and the toil-worn fingers stroked the  dog's soft fur. Hippity-Hop rubbed against Jan's legs, purring like a  noisy little buzz-saw, and Cheepsie flew down from his cage to perch  first on the shoulder of the captain and then on Prince Jan's head,  while a flood of bird-music filled the little room.    [Illustration: \"_I wish the children could see Jan now!_\"]    \"I wish the children could see Jan now!\" said Mr. Melville, and then he  told the captain about finding Jan and the story in the paper that  had brought the dog back to his master.

But although the heavy conservatism enforced by this primitive cult has  smothered initiative during many centuries it does not follow that the  mind and character of the African people have been impaired thereby  beyond the life of each generation. The mental sloth in which the  Western world lay steeped during the dark ages before the Reformation  did not become a heritable defect. But apart from the question of the  possibility of the transmission of acquired characters we have the fact  that within the scope of his daily life the conservative and uncivilised  African has to face and solve as many difficult problems as the  civilised European in his different surroundings. That these problems  are made up of elements differing from those that constitute the  problems of the civilised man in his daily avocation proves only a  difference of content, not of difficulty. The mental strain involved in  leading the so-called simple life of the so-called savage is, on the  whole, no less intense than that suffered by the civilised man in  maintaining his civilised existence. In the all-surrounding air of  superstition and mutual suspicion in which the African moves and has his  being he requires cunning to circumvent the cunning of his fellows,--and  very deep cunning it sometimes is,--so deep, indeed, that the  intellectual European has difficulty in following the dark and devious  ways thereof. Vigilance and resourcefulness, careful observation,  prudence, forethought, caution, judicious apprizement of character and  intelligent calculation of probabilities are required for the planning  of the primitive African's daily campaign against the forces of darkness  with which he is surrounded, and to carry out these plans he must have  courage, firmness of will and self-control in no less measure than the  average European city-dweller. To avoid the ever-present chance of being  found guilty of witchcraft, which in the past meant always death, the  African has had to develop the faculty of lying to a high point of  efficiency, and no one who knows him will contend that he is inferior to  the European in this respect. The natural education of the Natives  include the art of lying as the education of Spartan boys included the  practice of larceny. Lying, we know, develops the memory, for a good  memory is essential to successful lying. Some of the ruses and  stratagems thought out by Natives fleeing from the king's wrath or the  witch doctor's doom, of which I have heard from the Natives themselves,  have seemed to me to be in subtilty of design and in daring of execution  as admirable as any that may be found in contemporary detective fiction,  while the fortitude with which defeat and death has been accepted by  some of the unfortunate fugitives would evoke admiration in the least  impressionable of men. I say therefore that those who deny to the  Africans the capacity for sustained collective and purposive effort of  mind and body because these qualities have so far not been shown by them  in the building up of a civilisation of their own must consider the fact  that the nations which to-day lead the world in all the ways of  civilisation remained for thousands of years without leaders and without  achievement while the people who now lag behind produced those mighty  men that led and paved the way to the great civilisations of the past,  and I think that we must recognise in that fact a lesson to teach us  that present inferiority is no proof of permanent inability, wherefore  it may well be that the Natives of Africa will some day rise and compete  with their present overlords in the mastery of all the arts and crafts  of a modern state.    \"But,\" says the white South African, voicing the general opinion, \"this  is all very well; the Native may have the brains, but he does not, even  now when he has the chance of proving himself, show the same capacity  for strenuous and continued effort that the white man has shown. He  cannot stand alone; if left to himself he will sink back rapidly into  savagery.\"    That the South African Natives are still in a stage where they cannot  stand alone, so that if left entirely to their own devices they would  lapse back into barbarism, is not, I agree, open to doubt. But would not  the same fate overtake any nation or community, regardless of race, if  it were completely cut off from all outside help and influence. The  civilised Romans who conquered Britain in the early Christian era, no  doubt, looked upon the primitive Britons as a feeble folk when compared  with themselves, but the erstwhile slaves have since demonstrated their  capacity for developing a civilisation utterly beyond the imagination of  their foreign masters. Rome was not built in a day. The rearing of  Western civilisation required many centuries, and it can hardly be  doubted that if the early builders of the great cultures had been left  in isolation instead of being stimulated continually from without  through foreign learning and influence neither Ancient Rome nor Modern  Europe would have come into being. Isolation has always and everywhere  been followed by stagnation and regression and there is no reason for  expecting the Natives of South Africa to furnish an exception to the  universal rule.    That the average Native is lazy no one who knows him will deny. He is  certainly no less lazy than the average European work-man who must be  compelled by economic pressure to do hard labour. The rough and menial  work of the world has always been done through some sort of compulsion,  either slavery or some kind of economic coaction, for it is not in human  nature, white or black, to work hard at uncongenial tasks unless  superior force in some shape or other supplies the driving power. The  manual workers of Europe are forced by the economic conditions under  which they live to do the heavy and rough work that has to be  done--there are very few, even among white men, who like rough work for  its own sake--and when we consider how small are the wants of the  average South African Native we are often surprised that he works as  hard as he does. The common expression \"As lazy as a kaffir\" is  counterbalanced by the equally common saying used about a white man who  works hard at anything \"He works like a nigger,\" which suggests that  there is not much difference between the two races in this respect.    Nevertheless the mental attitude of the average Native undoubtedly  enables him to enjoy laziness more than the average European whose early  habits have been formed by different influences. Primitive man is a lazy  man whatever race he may belong to, and civilisation, which has often  been helped on by direct slavery, is indeed itself a system of slavery,  under which the toilers are driven to their tasks by the goad of  necessity. The fact that many Native youths frequently leave their  studies before completing the prescribed course, with the entry \"Left  school tired\" against their names, is often cited as showing that the  capacity of the Native for sustained mental effort is not as great as  that of the average European, but here, again, it must be remembered  that the general conditions and home influences under which the bulk of  European boys grow up tend to keep them at their studies whereas the  Native school boy is not fortified by similar support. The dread of  becoming an \"unemployable\" through lack of education, which is a  forcible spur to effort in both parents and children among the whites,  is not felt by the Natives who can always find work to do at wages that  will satisfy their ordinary wants, and, moreover, the Native's chance of  gaining profit and preferment through being well educated are still few  in South Africa, so that where there is neither penalty for failure nor  reward for success we cannot expect more effort than we find. When  education becomes as general in South Africa as it is among the people  of Europe then it will be possible to institute fair comparisons.  Education is the discoverer of ability and without the opportunity it  gives genius will languish and die unknown, as said that acute observer  of human nature, Machiavelli, in speaking about the leaders of  antiquity, \"Without opportunity their powers of mind would have been  extinguished and without those powers the opportunity would have come in  vain.\"[20]    Assuming that the capacity for acquiring Western education and  civilisation is no greater in the American Negroes than in the Bantu we  may note the opinion of a recent student of the race question in  America, as being in point here. In his book \"Children of the Slaves,\"  Mr. Stephen Graham says \"The fact is, Negrodom has to a great extent  qualified to vote. Half the population is sunk in economic bondage and  illiteracy, but the other half has more than average capacity for  citizenship.\"[21]    The opinion so often expressed in South Africa that \"Education is a kind  of thing that doesn't agree with the Nigger\" is born of the same feeling  that animated the power-holding minorities against the illiterate  majorities in Europe not many years ago, and, in justice to the  minorities, it must be conceded that the effect of education upon the  masses has always been disturbing and often disastrous.    Speaking now from my own experience I can say that I have found no  ill-effects from education in Natives; on the contrary, I have found, as  a rule, that the Native who has had an ordinary school education is  generally more amenable to precept and admonition than the raw kaffir  though less bovinely submissive and therefore more resentful of  indignities offered to him. The fact that the educated kaffir comes more  often in the way of committing theft and dishonesty than his"]]]
