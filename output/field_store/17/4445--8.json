[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#12)"],[1,"came out hurriedly, carrying a small hand-bag.    She wore a veil, so that her features were but vaguely distinguished,  but her every movement was agitated; and this agitation perceptibly  increased when, turning, she perceived the two of us bearing down  upon her.    Nayland Smith, who had been audibly counting the doors along the  corridor as we passed them, seized the woman's arm without ceremony,  and pulled her into the apartment she had been on the point of  quitting, closing the door behind us as we entered.    \"Smith!\" I began, \"for Heaven's sake what are you about?\"    \"You shall see, Petrie!\" he snapped.    He released the woman's arm, and pointing to an arm-chair near by--    \"Be seated,\" he said sternly.    Speechless with amazement, I stood, with my back to the door, watching  this singular scene. Our captive, who wore a smart walking costume and  whose appearance was indicative of elegance and culture, so far had  uttered no word of protest, no cry.    Now, whilst Smith stood rigidly pointing to the chair, she seated  herself with something very like composure and placed the leather bag  upon the floor beside her. The room in which I found myself was one of  a suite almost identical with our own, but from what I had gathered in  a hasty glance around, it bore no signs of recent tenancy. The window  was widely opened, and upon the floor lay a strange-looking contrivance  apparently made of aluminum. A large grip, open, stood beside it, and  from this some portions of a black coat and other garments protruded.    \"Now, madame,\" said Nayland Smith, \"will you be good enough to raise  your veil?\"    Silently, unprotestingly, the woman obeyed him, raising her gloved  hands and lifting the veil from her face.    The features revealed were handsome in a hard fashion, but heavily  made-up. Our captive was younger than I had hitherto supposed; a  blonde; her hair artificially reduced to the so-called Titian tint.  But, despite her youth, her eyes, with the blackened lashes, were full  of a world weariness. Now she smiled cynically.    \"Are you satisfied,\" she said, speaking unemotionally, \"or,\" holding  up her wrists, \"would you like to handcuff me?\"    Nayland Smith, glancing from the open grip and the appliance beside it  to the face of the speaker, began clicking his teeth together, whereby  I knew him to be perplexed. Then he stared across at me.    \"You appear bemused, Petrie,\" he said, with a certain irritation. \"Is  this what mystifies you?\"    Stooping, he picked up the metal contrivance, and almost savagely  jerked open the top section. It was a telescopic ladder, and more  ingeniously designed than anything of the kind I had seen before.  There was a sort of clamp attached to the base, and two sharply pointed  hooks at the top.    \"For reaching windows on an upper floor,\" snapped my friend, dropping  the thing with a clatter upon the carpet. \"An American device which  forms part of the equipment of the modern hotel thief!\"    He seemed to be disappointed--fiercely disappointed; and I found his  attitude inexplicable. He turned to the woman--who sat regarding him  with that fixed cynical smile.    \"Who are you?\" he demanded; \"and what business have you with the Si-Fan?\"    The woman's eyes opened more widely, and the smile disappeared from  her face.    \"The Si-Fan!\" she repeated slowly. \"I don't know what you mean,  Inspector.\"    \"I am not an Inspector,\" snapped Smith, \"and you know it well enough.  You have one chance--your last. To whom were you to deliver the box?  when and where?\"    But the blue eyes remained upraised to the grim tanned face with a  look of wonder in them, which, if assumed, marked the woman a  consummate actress.    \"Who are you?\" she asked in a low voice, \"and what are you talking  about?\"    Inactive, I stood by the door watching my friend, and his face was a  fruitful study in perplexity. He seemed upon the point of an angry  outburst, then, staring intently into the questioning eyes upraised  to his, he checked the words he would have uttered and began to click  his teeth together again.    \"You are some servant of Dr. Fu-Manchu!\" he said.    The girl frowned with a bewilderment which I could have sworn was not  assumed. Then--    \"You said I had one chance a moment ago,\" she replied. \"But if you  referred to my answering any of your questions, it is no chance at  all. We have gone under, and I know it. I am not complaining; it's  all in the game. There's a clear enough case against us, and I am  sorry\"--suddenly, unexpectedly, her eyes became filled with tears,  which coursed down her cheeks, leaving little wakes of blackness from  the make-up upon her lashes. Her lips trembled, and her voice shook.  \"I am sorry I let him do it. He'd never done anything--not anything  big like this--before, and he never would have done if he had not  met me....\"    The look of perplexity upon Smith's face was increasing with every  word that the girl uttered.    \"You don't seem to know me,\" she continued, her emotion growing  momentarily greater, \"and I don't know you; but they will know me at  Bow Street. I urged him to do it, when he told me about the box to-day  at lunch. He said that if it contained half as much as the Kuren  treasure-chest, we could sail for America and be on the straight all  the rest of our lives....\"    And now something which had hitherto been puzzling me became suddenly  evident. I had not removed the wig worn by the dead man, but I knew  that he had fair hair, and when in his last moments he had opened his  eyes, there had been in the contorted face something faintly familiar.    \"Smith!\" I cried excitedly, \"it is Lewison, Meyerstein's clerk! Don't  you understand? don't you understand?\"    Smith brought his teeth together with a snap and stared me hard in  the face.    \"I do, Petrie. I have been following a false scent. I do!\"    The girl in the chair was now sobbing convulsively.    \"He was tempted by the possibility of the box containing treasure,\" I  ran on, \"and his acquaintance with this--lady--who is evidently no  stranger to felonious operations, led him to make the attempt with her  assistance. But\"--I found myself confronted by a new problem--\"what  caused his death?\"    \"His ... _death_!\"    As a wild, hysterical shriek the words smote upon my ears. I turned,  to see the girl rise, tottering, from her seat. She began groping in  front of her, blindly, as though a darkness had descended.    \"You did not say he was dead?\" she whispered, \"not dead!--not ...\"    The words were lost in a wild peal of laughter. Clutching at her  throat she swayed and would have fallen had I not caught her in my  arms. As I laid her insensible upon the settee I met Smith's glance.    \"I think I know that, too, Petrie,\" he said gravely.        CHAPTER XIV    THE GOLDEN POMEGRANATES      \"What was it that he cried out?\" demanded Nayland Smith abruptly. \"I  was in the sitting-room and it sounded to me like 'pomegranates'!\"    We were bending over Lewison; for now, the wig removed, Lewison it  proved unmistakably to be, despite the puffy and pallid face.    \"He said 'the golden pomegranates,'\" I replied, and laughed harshly.  \"They were words of delirium and cannot possibly have any bearing  upon the manner of his death.\"    \"I disagree.\"    He strode out into the sitting-room.    Weymouth was below, supervising the removal of the unhappy prisoner,  and together Smith and I stood looking down at the brass box. Suddenly--    \"I propose to attempt to open it,\" said my friend.    His words came as a complete surprise.    \"For what reason?--and why have you so suddenly changed your mind?\"    \"For a reason which I hope will presently become evident,\" he said;  \"and as to my change of mind, unless I am greatly mistaken, the wily  old Chinaman from whom I wrested this treasure was infinitely more  clever than I gave him credit for being!\"    Through the open window came faintly to my ears the chiming of Big Ben.  The hour was a quarter to two. London's pulse was dimmed now, and  around about us that great city slept as soundly as it ever sleeps.  Other sounds came vaguely through the fog, and beside Nayland Smith  I sat and watched him at work upon the Tulun-Nur box.    Every knob of the intricate design he pushed, pulled and twisted; but  without result. The night wore on, and just before three o'clock  Inspector Weymouth knocked upon the door. I admitted him, and side by  side the two of us stood watching Smith patiently pursuing his task.    All conversation had ceased, when, just as the muted booming of  London's clocks reached my ears again and Weymouth pulled out his  watch, there came a faint click ... and I saw that Smith had raised  the lid of the coffer!    Weymouth and I sprang forward with one accord, and over Smith's  shoulders peered into the interior. There was a second lid of some  dull, black wood, apparently of great age, and fastened to it so as  to form knobs or handles was an exquisitely carved pair of _golden  pomegranates!_    \"They are to raise the wooden lid, Mr. Smith!\" cried Weymouth eagerly.    \"Look! there is a hollow in each to accommodate the fingers!\"    \"Aren't you going to open it?\" I demanded excitedly--\"aren't you going  to open it?\"    \"Might I invite you to accompany me into the bedroom yonder for a  moment?\" he replied in a tome of studied reserve. \"You also, Weymouth?\"    Smith leading, we entered the room where the dead man lay stretched  upon the bed.    \"Note the appearance of his fingers,\" directed Nayland Smith.    I examined the peculiarity to which Smith had drawn my attention. The  dead man's fingers were swollen extraordinarily, the index finger of  either hand especially being oddly discolored, as though bruised from  the nail upward. I looked again at the ghastly face, then, repressing  a shudder, for the sight was one not good to look upon, I turned to  Smith, who was watching me expectantly with his keen, steely eyes.

As man has come to occupy a greater portion of the earth's  surface, and as he has become more and more the master of his  environment, he has inevitably disturbed the relationships of the birds  and mammals about him, has upset the balance of nature. If he kills the  carnivorous species because of their depredations on game and live stock  he must be prepared to cope with the increased hordes of rodents which  feed on vegetation and on which the carnivorous animals act as a check.  If he destroys the rodents, he may remove the checks on certain noxious  plants or insects. One control measure often necessitates the adoption  of another.    This is not to argue against control measures, for if our harmful  species were not controlled, agriculture in many sections would be  impossible. Control measures, however, should be scientifically founded  and applied. The indiscriminate slaughter of supposedly harmful species  of birds and mammals in the guise of benefiting agriculture may do far  more harm than good. Many of the species which do some harm do far more  good. The exact status of each suspected species should be carefully  determined through an adequate scientific investigation. If the species  is condemned, sound control measures should be thoroughly applied.    In grazing districts or in areas devoted to intensive agriculture the  death sentence should probably be passed on the banner-tailed kangaroo  rat. It should be recalled, however, that this is the largest and one of  the handsomest of all its family, and that it is one of the most  characteristic and interesting of all the desert fauna; where extensive  grazing or agricultural operations are not undertaken, therefore, we  feel that the kangaroo rat should be let alone, unless its presence  threatens infestation of valuable agricultural or grazing lands.          SUMMARY.      (1) Kangaroo rats may be separated with ease from all other mammals; the  long tail and short and weak fore feet separate them from the pocket  gophers; the white hip-stripe distinguishes them from the pocket mice.  The decidedly larger size and the white-tipped tail separate _Dipodomys  spectabilis spectabilis_ and _D. deserti_ from _D._ _merriami_ and _D.  ordii_. The darker color and vividly contrasted black-and-white tail of  _spectabilis_ distinguish it from _deserti_.    (2) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ occurs in the open arid country of  portions of the Lower and Upper Sonoran Zones of Arizona, New Mexico,  Texas, Sonora, and Chihuahua. It lives in harder soil than does  _deserti_, and builds more conspicuous mounds.    (3) There is no evidence of intergradation or hybridization between  _spectabilis_ and _deserti_.    (4) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is nocturnal; it is gentle, and does not  offer to bite when taken in the hand; is silent for the most part;  active; somewhat sociable with its fellows, but fights in defense of its  food stores; progresses chiefly by leaping; signals by a drumming or  tapping on the ground with its hind feet.    (5) The breeding season of _spectabilis_ begins in January and continues  into August. Whether more than one litter is raised in a single season  is unknown. The number of young in each litter varies from 1 to 3,  averaging 2.    (6) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ does not hibernate, but provides food  stores, mostly seeds, for use during seasons when food would be  otherwise unavailable. Storage in each den varies in quantity from 5  grams (about 1/6 ounce) to 5,750 grams (12.67 pounds). Materials stored  include several important forage plants; for example, various species of  _Bouteloua_ and _Aristida_, with _B. rothrockii_ (crowfoot grama) the  most important. Accessibility and abundance of different plants have  much to do with the kinds of storage found.    (7) The dens of _spectabilis_ are the most notable of all kangaroo rat  dwelling places. They range from 6 inches to 4 feet in vertical height,  and from 5 to 15 feet in diameter. Here the kangaroo rat has its home,  shelter, and food-storage chambers. Within the den is found a tortuous  network of burrows, with many storage and some nest chambers, the whole  arranged so as to be two to four stories high.    (8) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is not of great economic significance,  except locally, in ordinary seasons. During periods of extreme drought  it may be of critical importance on grazing areas from the standpoint of  the carrying capacity of the range.    (9) Kangaroo rats are easy to poison by following the same formula as  that used by the Biological Survey for destroying prairie dogs.    (10) In many places unsuited to extensive grazing or agriculture  _spectabilis_ does no appreciable damage. It is one of the most  interesting of all the rodents peculiar to our Southwestern deserts, and  should not be molested except where it is destructive.          BIBLIOGRAPHY.      ALLEN, J.
