[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1563"],[0,"The Crystal Stopper (#12)"],[1,"night  some one tried to open the hall-door. When the attempt failed, a few  minutes of absolute silence followed. And Lupin was beginning to think  that the men had abandoned the idea, when he gave a sudden start. Some  one had passed, without the least sound to interrupt the silence. He  would not have known it, so utterly were the thing's steps deadened by  the stair-carpet, if the baluster-rail, which he himself held in his  hand, had not shaken slightly. Some one was coming upstairs.    And, as the ascent continued, Lupin became aware of the uncanny feeling  that he heard nothing more than before. He knew, because of the rail,  that a thing was coming and he could count the number of steps climbed  by noting each vibration of the rail; but no other indication gave him  that dim sensation of presence which we feel in distinguishing movements  which we do not see, in perceiving sounds which we do not hear. And yet  a blacker darkness ought to have taken shape within the darkness and  something ought, at least, to modify the quality of the silence. No, he  might well have believed that there was no one there.    And Lupin, in spite of himself and against the evidence of his reason,  ended by believing it, for the rail no longer moved and he thought that  he might have been the sport of an illusion.    And this lasted a long time. He hesitated, not knowing what to do, not  knowing what to suppose. But an odd circumstance impressed him. A clock  struck two. He recognized the chime of Daubrecq's clock. And the chime  was that of a clock from which one is not separated by the obstacle of a  door.    Lupin slipped down the stairs and went to the door. It was closed,  but there was a space on the left, at the bottom, a space left by the  removal of the little panel.    He listened. Daubrecq, at that moment, turned in his bed; and his  breathing was resumed, evenly and a little stertorously. And Lupin  plainly heard the sound of rumpling garments. Beyond a doubt, the thing  was there, fumbling and feeling through the clothes which Daubrecq had  laid beside his bed.    \"Now,\" thought Lupin, \"we shall learn something. But how the deuce did  the beggar get in? Has he managed to draw the bolts and open the door?  But, if so, why did he make the mistake of shutting it again?\"    Not for a second--a curious anomaly in a man like Lupin, an anomaly  to be explained only by the uncanny feeling which the whole adventure  produced in him--not for a second did he suspect the very simple truth  which was about to be revealed to him. Continuing his way down, he  crouched on one of the bottom steps of the staircase, thus placing  himself between the door of the bedroom and the hall-door, on the  road which Daubrecq's enemy must inevitably take in order to join his  accomplices.    He questioned the darkness with an unspeakable anguish. He was on  the point of unmasking that enemy of Daubrecq's, who was also his  own adversary. He would thwart his plans. And the booty captured from  Daubrecq he would capture in his turn, while Daubrecq slept and while  the accomplices lurking behind the hall-door or outside the garden-gate  vainly awaited their leader's return.    And that return took place. Lupin knew it by the renewed vibration of  the balusters. And, once more, with every sense strained and every  nerve on edge, he strove to discern the mysterious thing that was coming  toward him. He suddenly realized it when only a few yards away. He  himself, hidden in a still darker recess, could not be seen. And what  he saw--in the very vaguest manner--was approaching stair by stair, with  infinite precautions, holding on to each separate baluster.    \"Whom the devil have I to do with?\" said Lupin to himself, while his  heart thumped inside his chest.    The catastrophe was hastened. A careless movement on Lupin's part was  observed by the stranger, who stopped short. Lupin was afraid lest the  other should turn back and take to flight. He sprang at the adversary  and was stupefied at encountering nothing but space and knocking against  the stair-rail without seizing the form which he saw. But he at once  rushed forward, crossed the best part of the hall and caught up his  antagonist just as he was reaching the door opening on the garden.    There was a cry of fright, answered by other cries on the further side  of the door.    \"Oh, hang it, what's this?\" muttered Lupin, whose arms had closed, in  the dark, round a little, tiny, trembling, whimpering thing.    Suddenly understanding, he stood for a moment motionless and dismayed,  at a loss what to do with his conquered prey. But the others were  shouting and stamping outside the door. Thereupon, dreading lest  Daubrecq should wake up, he slipped the little thing under his jacket,  against his chest, stopped the crying with his handkerchief rolled into  a ball and hurried up the three flights of stairs.    \"Here,\" he said to Victoire, who woke with a start. \"I've brought you  the indomitable chief of our enemies, the Hercules of the gang. Have you  a feeding-bottle about you?\"    He put down in the easy-chair a child of six or seven years of age, the  tiniest little fellow in a gray jersey and a knitted woollen cap, whose  pale and exquisitely pretty features were streaked with the tears that  streamed from the terrified eyes.    \"Where did you pick that up?\" asked Victoire, aghast.    \"At the foot of the stairs, as it was coming out of Daubrecq's bedroom,\"  replied Lupin, feeling the jersey in the hope that the child had brought  a booty of some kind from that room.    Victoire was stirred to pity:    \"Poor little dear! Look, he's trying not to cry!... Oh, saints above,  his hands are like ice! Don't be afraid, sonnie, we sha'n't hurt you:  the gentleman's all right.\"    \"Yes,\" said Lupin, \"the gentleman's quite all right, but there's another  very wicked gentleman who'll wake up if they go on making such a rumpus  outside the hall-door. Do you hear them, Victoire?\"    \"Who is it?\"    \"The satellites of our young Hercules, the indomitable leader's gang.\"    \"Well...?\" stammered Victoire, utterly unnerved.    \"Well, as I don't want to be caught in the trap, I shall start by  clearing out. Are you coming, Hercules?\"    He rolled the child in a blanket, so that only its head remained  outside, gagged its mouth as gently as possible and made Victoire fasten  it to his shoulders:    \"See, Hercules? We're having a game. You never thought you'd find  gentlemen to play pick-a-back with you at three o'clock in the morning!  Come, whoosh, let's fly away! You don't get giddy, I hope?\"    He stepped across the window-ledge and set foot on one of the rungs of  the ladder. He was in the garden in a minute.    He had never ceased hearing and now heard more plainly still the blows  that were being struck upon the front-door. He was astounded that  Daubrecq was not awakened by so violent a din:    \"If I don't put a stop to this, they'll spoil everything,\" he said to  himself.    He stood in an angle of the house, invisible in the darkness, and  measured the distance between himself and the gate. The gate was open.  To his right, he saw the steps, on the top of which the people were  flinging themselves about; to his left, the building occupied by the  portress.    The woman had come out of her lodge and was standing near the people,  entreating them:    \"Oh, do be quiet, do be quiet! He'll come!\"    \"Capital!\" said Lupin. \"The good woman is an accomplice of these as  well. By Jingo, what a pluralist!\"    He rushed across to her and, taking her by the scruff of the neck,  hissed:    \"Go and tell them I've got the child... They can come and fetch it at my  place, Rue Chateaubriand.\"    A little way off, in the avenue, stood a taxi which Lupin presumed to be  engaged by the gang. Speaking authoritatively, as though he were one of  the accomplices, he stepped into the cab and told the man to drive him  home.    \"Well,\" he said to the child, \"that wasn't much of a shake-up, was  it?... What do you say to going to bye-bye on the gentleman's bed?\"    As his servant, Achille, was asleep, Lupin made the little chap  comfortable and stroked his hair for him. The child seemed numbed. His  poor face was as though petrified into a stiff expression made up, at  one and the same time, of fear and the wish not to show fear, of the  longing to scream and a pitiful effort not to scream.    \"Cry, my pet, cry,\" said Lupin. \"It'll do you good to cry.\"    The child did not cry, but the voice was so gentle and so kind that he  relaxed his tense muscles; and, now that his eyes were calmer and  his mouth less contorted, Lupin, who was examining him closely, found  something that he recognized, an undoubted resemblance.    This again confirmed certain facts which he suspected and which he had  for some time been linking in his mind. Indeed, unless he was mistaken,  the position was becoming very different and he would soon assume the  direction of events. After that...    A ring at the bell followed, at once, by two others, sharp ones.    \"Hullo!\" said Lupin to the child. \"Here's mummy come to fetch you. Don't  move.\"    He ran and opened the door.    A woman entered, wildly:    \"My son!\" she screamed. \"My son! Where is he?\"    \"In my room,\" said Lupin.    Without asking more, thus proving that she knew the way, she rushed to  the bedroom.    \"As I thought,\" muttered Lupin. \"The youngish woman with the gray hair:  Daubrecq's friend and enemy.\"    He walked to the window and looked through the curtains. Two men were  striding up and down the opposite pavement: the Growler and the Masher.    \"And they're not even hiding themselves,\" he said to himself. \"That's  a good sign. They consider that they can't do without me any longer and  that they've got to obey the governor. There remains the pretty lady  with the gray hair. That will be more difficult. It's you and I now,  mummy.\"    He found the mother and the boy clasped in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],[0,"The Last Days of Pompeii (#12)"],[1,"such  ends.  But you wish me to apply these generalities to yourself; I hasten  to obey the wish.  The altars of the goddess of our ancient faith must  be served, and served too by others than the stolid and soulless things  that are but as pegs and hooks whereon to hang the fillet and the robe.  Remember two sayings of Sextus the Pythagorean, sayings borrowed from  the lore of Egypt.  The first is, \"Speak not of God to the multitude\";  the second is, \"The man worthy of God is a god among men.\" As Genius  gave to the ministers of Egypt worship, that empire in late ages so  fearfully decayed, thus by Genius only can the dominion be restored.  I  saw in you, Apaecides, a pupil worthy of my lessons--a minister worthy  of the great ends which may yet be wrought; your energy, your talents,  your purity of faith, your earnestness of enthusiasm, all fitted you for  that calling which demands so imperiously high and ardent qualities: I  fanned, therefore, your sacred desires; I stimulated you to the step you  have taken. But you blame me that I did not reveal to you the little  souls and the juggling tricks of your companions.  Had I done so,  Apaecides, I had defeated my own object; your noble nature would have at  once revolted, and Isis would have lost her priest.'    Apaecides groaned aloud.  The Egyptian continued, without heeding the  interruption.    'I placed you, therefore, without preparation, in the temple; I left you  suddenly to discover and to be sickened by all those mummeries which  dazzle the herd.  I desired that you should perceive how those engines  are moved by which the fountain that refreshes the world casts its  waters in the air.  It was the trial ordained of old to all our priests.  They who accustom themselves to the impostures of the vulgar, are left  to practise them--for those like you, whose higher natures demand higher  pursuit, religion opens more god-like secrets.  I am pleased to find in  you the character I had expected.  You have taken the vows; you cannot  recede.  Advance--I will be your guide.'    'And what wilt thou teach me, O singular and fearful man?  New  cheats--new...'    'No--I have thrown thee into the abyss of disbelief; I will lead thee  now to the eminence of faith.  Thou hast seen the false types: thou  shalt learn now the realities they represent.  There is no shadow,  Apaecides, without its substance.  Come to me this night.  Your hand.'    Impressed, excited, bewildered by the language of the Egyptian,  Apaecides gave him his hand, and master and pupil parted.    It was true that for Apaecides there was no retreat.  He had taken the  vows of celibacy: he had devoted himself to a life that at present  seemed to possess all the austerities of fanaticism, without any of the  consolations of belief It was natural that he should yet cling to a  yearning desire to reconcile himself to an irrevocable career.  The  powerful and profound mind of the Egyptian yet claimed an empire over  his young imagination; excited him with vague conjecture, and kept him  alternately vibrating between hope and fear.    Meanwhile Arbaces pursued his slow and stately way to the house of Ione.  As he entered the tablinum, he heard a voice from the porticoes of the  peristyle beyond, which, musical as it was, sounded displeasingly on his  ear--it was the voice of the young and beautiful Glaucus, and for the  first time an involuntary thrill of jealousy shot through the breast of  the Egyptian.  On entering the peristyle, he found Glaucus seated by the  side of Ione.  The fountain in the odorous garden cast up its silver  spray in the air, and kept a delicious coolness in the midst of the  sultry noon.  The handmaids, almost invariably attendant on Ione, who  with her freedom of life preserved the most delicate modesty, sat at a  little distance; by the feet of Glaucus lay the lyre on which he had  been playing to Ione one of the Lesbian airs.  The scene--the group  before Arbaces, was stamped by that peculiar and refined ideality of  poesy which we yet, not erroneously, imagine to be the distinction of  the ancients--the marble columns, the vases of flowers, the statue,  white and tranquil, closing every vista; and, above all, the two living  forms, from which a sculptor might have caught either inspiration or  despair!    Arbaces, pausing for a moment, gazed on the pair with a brow from which  all the usual stern serenity had fled; he recovered himself by an  effort, and slowly approached them, but with a step so soft and  echoless, that even the attendants heard him not; much less Ione and her  lover.    'And yet,' said Glaucus, 'it is only before we love that we imagine that  our poets have truly described the passion; the instant the sun rises,  all the stars that had shone in his absence vanish into air.  The poets  exist only in the night of the heart; they are nothing to us when we  feel the full glory of the god.'    'A gentle and most glowing image, noble Glaucus.'    Both started, and recognized behind the seat of Ione the cold and  sarcastic face of the Egyptian.    'You are a sudden guest,' said Glaucus, rising, and with a forced smile.    'So ought all to be who know they are welcome,' returned Arbaces,  seating himself, and motioning to Glaucus to do the same.    'I am glad,' said Ione, 'to see you at length together; for you are  suited to each other, and you are formed to be friends.'    'Give me back some fifteen years of life,' replied the Egyptian, 'before  you can place me on an equality with Glaucus.  Happy should I be to  receive his friendship; but what can I give him in return?  Can I make  to him the same confidences that he would repose in me--of banquets and  garlands--of Parthian steeds, and the chances of the dice? these  pleasures suit his age, his nature, his career: they are not for mine.'    So saying, the artful Egyptian looked down and sighed; but from the  corner of his eye he stole a glance towards Ione, to see how she  received these insinuations of the pursuits of her visitor.  Her  countenance did not satisfy him.  Glaucus, slightly coloring, hastened  gaily to reply.  Nor was he, perhaps, without the wish in his turn to  disconcert and abash the Egyptian.    'You are right, wise Arbaces,' said he; 'we can esteem each other, but  we cannot be friends.  My banquets lack the secret salt which, according  to rumor, gives such zest to your own.  And, by Hercules! when I have  reached your age, if I, like you, may think it wise to pursue the  pleasures of manhood, like you, I shall be doubtless sarcastic on the  gallantries of youth.'    The Egyptian raised his eyes to Glaucus with a sudden and piercing  glance.    'I do not understand you,' said he, coldly; 'but it is the custom to  consider that wit lies in obscurity.' He turned from Glaucus as he  spoke, with a scarcely perceptible sneer of contempt, and after a  moment's pause addressed himself to Ione.    'I have not, beautiful Ione,' said he, 'been fortunate enough to find  you within doors the last two or three times that I have visited your  vestibule.'    'The smoothness of the sea has tempted me much from home,' replied Ione,  with a little embarrassment.    The embarrassment did not escape Arbaces; but without seeming to heed  it, he replied with a smile: 'You know the old poet says, that \"Women  should keep within doors, and there converse.\"'    'The poet was a cynic,' said Glaucus, 'and hated women.'    'He spoke according to the customs of his country, and that country is  your boasted Greece.'    'To different periods different customs.  Had our forefathers known  Ione, they had made a different law.'    'Did you learn these pretty gallantries at Rome?' said Arbaces, with  ill-suppressed emotion.    'One certainly would not go for gallantries to Egypt,' retorted Glaucus,  playing carelessly with his chain.    'Come, come,' said Ione, hastening to interrupt a conversation which she  saw, to her great distress, was so little likely to cement the intimacy  she had desired to effect between Glaucus and her friend, 'Arbaces must  not be so hard upon his poor pupil.  An orphan, and without a mother's  care, I may be to blame for the independent and almost masculine liberty  of life that I have chosen: yet it is not greater than the Roman women  are accustomed to--it is not greater than the Grecian ought to be.  Alas! is it only to be among men that freedom and virtue are to be  deemed united?  Why should the slavery that destroys you be considered  the only method to preserve us?  Ah! believe me, it has been the great  error of men--and one that has worked bitterly on their destinies--to  imagine that the nature of women is (I will not say inferior, that may  be so, but) so different from their own, in making laws unfavorable to  the intellectual advancement of women.  Have they not, in so doing, made  laws against their children, whom women are to rear?--against the  husbands, of whom women are to be the friends, nay, sometimes the  advisers?' Ione stopped short suddenly, and her face was suffused with  the most enchanting blushes.  She feared lest her enthusiasm had led her  too far; yet she feared the austere Arbaces less than the courteous  Glaucus, for she loved the last, and it was not the custom of the Greeks  to allow their women (at least such of their women as they most honored)  the same liberty and the same station as those of Italy enjoyed. She  felt, therefore, a thrill of delight as Glaucus earnestly replied:    'Ever mayst thou think thus, Ione--ever be your pure heart your unerring  guide!  Happy it had been for Greece if she had given to the chaste the  same intellectual charms that are so celebrated amongst the less worthy  of her women.  No state falls from freedom--from knowledge, while your  sex smile only on the free, and by appreciating, encourage the wise.'    Arbaces was silent, for it was neither his part to sanction the  sentiment of Glaucus, nor to condemn that"]]]
