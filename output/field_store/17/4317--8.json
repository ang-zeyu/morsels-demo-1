Another objection comes from the facts of heredity. On the whole we  resemble our parents and ancestors in mind as well as in body. A child  often seems to be an obvious product of its parents and not a being come  from outside and from another life. This objection of course applies  equally to the creation theory. If the soul is created by an act of God,  there seems to be no reason why it should be like the parents, or, if he  causes it to be like them, he is made responsible for sending children  into the world with vicious natures. On the other hand if parents  literally make a child, mind as well as body, there seems to be no  reason why children should ever be unlike their parents, or brothers and  sisters unlike one another, as they undoubtedly sometimes are. An Indian  would say that a soul[44] seeking rebirth carries with it certain  potentialities of good and evil and can obtain embodiment only in a  family offering the necessary conditions. Hence to some extent it is  natural that the child should be like its parents. But the soul seeking  rebirth is not completely fixed in form and stiff: it is hampered and  limited by the results of its previous life, but in many respects it may  be flexible and free, ready to vary in response to its new environment.    But there is a psychological and temperamental objection to the doctrine  of rebirth, which goes to the root of the matter. Love of life and the  desire to find a field of activity are so strong in most Europeans that  it might be supposed that a theory offering an endless vista of new  activities and new chances would be acceptable. But as a rule Europeans  who discuss the question say that they do not relish this prospect. They  may be willing to struggle until death, but they wish for  repose--conscious repose of course--afterwards. The idea that one just  dead has not entered into his rest, but is beginning another life with  similar struggles and fleeting successes, similar sorrows and  disappointments, is not satisfying and is almost shocking[45]. We do not  like it, and not to like any particular view about the destinies of the  soul is generally, but most illogically, considered a reason for  rejecting it[46].      12.    It must not however be supposed that Hindus like the prospect of  transmigration. On the contrary from the time of the Upanishads and the  Buddha to the present day their religious ideal corresponding to  salvation is emancipation and deliverance, deliverance from rebirth and  from the bondage of desire which brings about rebirth. Now all Indian  theories as to the nature of transmigration are in some way connected  with the idea of _Karma_, that is the power of deeds done in past  existences to condition or even to create future existences. Every deed  done, whether good or bad, affects the character of the doer for a long  while, so that to use a metaphor, the soul awaiting rebirth has a  special shape, which is of its own making, and it can find re-embodiment  only in a form into which that shape can squeeze.    These views of rebirth and karma have a moral value, for they teach that  what a man gets depends on what he is or makes himself to be, and they  avoid the difficulty of supposing that a benevolent creator can have  given his creatures only one life with such strange and unmerited  disproportion in their lots. Ordinary folk in the East hope that a life  of virtue will secure them another life as happy beings on earth or  perhaps in some heaven which, though not eternal, will still be long.  But for many the higher ideal is renunciation of the world and a life of  contemplative asceticism which will accumulate no karma so that after  death the soul will pass not to another birth but to some higher and  more mysterious state which is beyond birth and death. It is the  prevalence of views like this which has given both Hinduism and Buddhism  the reputation of being pessimistic and unpractical.    It is generally assumed that these are bad epithets, but are they not  applicable to Christian teaching? Modern and medieval Christianity--as  witness many popular hymns--regards this world as vain and transitory, a  vale of tears and tribulation, a troubled sea through whose waves we  must pass before we reach our rest. And choirs sing, though without much  conviction, that it is weary waiting here. This language seems justified  by the Gospels and Epistles. It is true that some utterances of Christ  suggest that happiness is to be found in a simple and natural life of  friendliness and love, but on the whole both he and St Paul teach that  the world is evil or at least spoiled and distorted: to become a happy  world it must be somehow remade and transfigured by the second coming of  Christ. The desires and ambitions which are the motive power of modern  Europe are, if not wrong, at least vain and do not even seek for true  peace and happiness. Like Indian teachers, the early Christians tried to  create a right temper rather than to change social institutions. They  bade masters and slaves treat one another with kindness and respect, but  they did not attempt to abolish slavery.    Indian thought does not really go much further in pessimism than  Christianity, but its pessimism is intellectual rather than emotional.  He who understands the nature of the soul and its successive lives  cannot regard any single life as of great importance in itself, though  its consequences for the future may be momentous, and though he will not  say that life is not worth living. Reiterated declarations that all  existence is suffering do, it is true, seem to destroy all prospect of  happiness and all motive for effort, but the more accurate statement is,  in the words of the Buddha himself, that all clinging to physical  existence involves suffering. The earliest Buddhist texts teach that  when this clinging and craving cease, a feeling of freedom and happiness  takes their place and later Buddhism treated itself to visions of  paradise as freely as Christianity. Many forms of Hinduism teach that  the soul released from the body can enjoy eternal bliss in the presence  of God and even those severer philosophers who do not admit that the  released soul is a personality in any human sense have no doubt of its  happiness.    The opposition is not so much between Indian thought and the New  Testament, for both of them teach that bliss is attainable but not by  satisfying desire. The fundamental contrast is rather between both India  and the New Testament on the one hand and on the other the rooted  conviction of European races[47], however much Christian orthodoxy may  disguise their expression of it, that this world is all-important. This  conviction finds expression not only in the avowed pursuit of pleasure  and ambition but in such sayings as that the best religion is the one  which does most good and such ideals as self-realization or the full  development of one's nature and powers. Europeans as a rule have an  innate dislike and mistrust of the doctrine that the world is vain or  unreal. They can accord some sympathy to a dying man who sees in due  perspective the unimportance of his past life or to a poet who under the  starry heavens can make felt the smallness of man and his earth. But  such thoughts are considered permissible only as retrospects, not as  principles of life: you may say that your labour has amounted to  nothing, but not that labour is vain. Though monasteries and monks still  exist, the great majority of Europeans instinctively disbelieve in  asceticism, the contemplative life and contempt of the world: they have  no love for a philosopher who rejects the idea of progress and is not  satisfied with an ideal consisting in movement towards an unknown goal.  They demand a religion which theoretically justifies the strenuous life.  All this is a matter of temperament and the temperament is so common  that it needs no explanation. What needs explanation is rather the other  temperament which rejects this world as unsatisfactory and sets up  another ideal, another sphere, another standard of values. This ideal  and standard are not entirely peculiar to India but certainly they are  understood and honoured there more than elsewhere. They are professed,  as I have already observed, by Christianity, but even the New Testament  is not free from the idea that saints are having a bad time now but will  hereafter enjoy a triumph, parlously like the exuberance of the wicked  in this world. The Far East too has its unworldly side which, though  harmonizing with Buddhism, is native. In many ways the Chinese are as  materialistic as Europeans, but throughout the long history of their art  and literature, there has always been a school, clear-voiced if small,  which has sung and pursued the joys of the hermit, the dweller among  trees and mountains who finds nature and his own thoughts an  all-sufficient source of continual happiness. But the Indian ideal,  though it often includes the pleasures of communion with nature, differs  from most forms of the Chinese and Christian ideal inasmuch as it  assumes the reality of certain religious experiences and treats them as  the substance and occupation of the highest life. We are disposed to  describe these experiences as trances or visions, names which generally  mean something morbid or hypnotic. But in India their validity is  unquestioned and they are not considered morbid. The sensual scheming  life of the world is sick and ailing; the rapture of contemplation is  the true and healthy life of the soul. More than that it is the type and  foretaste of a higher existence compared with which this world is  worthless or rather nothing at all. This view has been held in India for  nearly three thousand years: it has been confirmed by the experience of  men whose writings testify to their intellectual power"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15262"],[0,"Christianity and Islam in Spain, A.D. 756-1031 (#12)"],[1,"er, lest the  Christians should preserve them as relics. Ruderic's body was washed on  shore, fresh as when killed; while Salomon, not being equally fortunate,  informed a devout Christian in a vision, where his body lay in a  tamarisk thicket near the town of Nymphianum.    Hitherto the aider and abettor of these martyrdoms had himself contrived  to escape the penalty, which he had urged others to brave. Whether this  was due to any unworthy fear of death on his part is not clear, but it  may have been owing to the respect in which he was held by the Moslem  authorities. To these he was well known as a man of irreproachable  character and unaffected piety, and several Arabs of high rank, who were  his personal friends, shewed themselves anxious to screen him from the  effects of his folly. Eulogius[4] was descended from a Senatorial family  of Cordova, and was educated at the Church of St Zoilus, where he  devoted himself to ecclesiastical studies, and soon surpassed his  contemporaries in learning. With his friend Alvar he sat at the feet of  Speraindeo, an eminent abbot in the province of Baetica. Besides a  sister Anulo, Eulogius had two brothers engaged in trade, and another  brother, Joseph, who seems to have been in government employ.[5]        [1] Eulog., \"Lib. Apol.,\" sec. 21 ff.        [2] So the Inquisitors in Spain used to pretend that their      victims had abjured their errors before being burnt.        [3] Eul., \"Lib. Apol.,\" sec. 27.        [4] Life by Alvar, c. i. sec. 2.        [5] Eul. ad Wiliesindum, sec. 8, \"Joseph, quem saeva tyranni      indignatio eo tempore a principatu dejecerat:\" unless this is a      metaphorical allusion to Joseph in Egypt.    Eulogius became early noted for his practice of asceticism, and his  desire for the life of a monk,[1] and for the glory of martyrdom. When  strong measures were taken by the authorities, in concert with  Reccafredus, Bishop of Seville, to stamp out the mania for martyrdom by  threats, stripes, and imprisonment, though many were frightened into  submission, Eulogius, Alvar tells us,[2] remained firm, in spite of his  being singled out as an \"incentor martyrum\" by a certain Gomez, who was  a temporising Christian in the king's service.[3]        [1] Life by Alvar, sec. 3, \"Ne virtus animi curis Saecularibus      enervaretur, quotidie ad caelestia cupiens volare corporea      sarcina gravabatur.\"        [2] \"Hic inadibilis (=firm) nunquam vacillare vel tenui est      visus susurro.\"--Life by Alvar, sec. 5.        [3] This man, says Alvar, sec. 6, by a divine judgment, lost      his hold on the Christian faith, which he thus scrupled not to      attack. See below, p. 72.    There is no doubt that Eulogius did all he could to interfere with and  check that amalgamation of the Christians and Arabs which he saw going  on round him. Believing that such close relations between the peoples  tended to the spiritual degradation of Christianity, he set himself  deliberately to embitter those relations, and, as far as he could, to  make a good understanding impossible. To discourage the learning of  Arabic by the Christians, he brought back with him from a journey to  Pampluna the classical writings of Virgil, Horace (Satires), Juvenal,  and Augustine's \"De Civitate Dei.\"    At the time when these martyrdoms took place, Eulogius was a priest, but  for some reason he tried to abstain from officiating at the mass on the  ground that he was himself a great sinner.[1] However, his  ecclesiastical superior[2] (? Saul, Bishop of Cordova), soon made him  take a different view of the question by threatening him with anathema  if he neglected his duty any longer. Coming forward as a prominent  champion of the extreme party in the Church, he was imprisoned in 851,  where he wrote treatises in favour of the martyrs, and was released, as  we have seen, by the intercession of Flora and Maria on November 29th of  that year.        [1] He pleads his \"delicti onera,\" ch. i. sec. 7. Perhaps he      was infected with one of the \"Migetian errors\" of the previous      century, which was that \"priests must be saints.\" Saul, Bishop      of Cordova (850-861), in a letter to another bishop (Florez,      xi. 156-163), refers with disapproval to those (? Eulogius) who      held that \"sacramenta tunc esse solum modo sancta, cum      sanctorum fuerint manibus praelibata;\" and he quotes Augustine      and Isidore against the error.        [2] Pontifex proprius.    In 858,[1] on the death of Wistremirus, he was chosen by  the votes of the people[2] to succeed him as Bishop of Toledo;  but from some cause, perhaps by the intervention of the  Moslems, he was prevented from occupying his see. The  people then determined to have no bishop, if they might  not have him.[3] Yet, adds the pious Alvar, he got his  bishopric after all, for \"all holy men are bishops, though  not all bishops holy men.\"        [1] \"Life of Eul.,\" Alvar, ii. sec. 10.        [2] \"Communis electio.\"        [3] Fleury, v. 547, says another bishop was elected in      Eulogius' lifetime; but Alvar's words are \"Alium sibi eo      vivente interdixerunt eligere.\"    In the following year he was again imprisoned as being a disturber of  the public peace, but as on a former occasion he had been allowed to  support and encourage Flora and Maria, so now was he permitted to finish  in prison a book in defence of the martyrs,[1] which had the direct  tendency of inciting others to go and do likewise. The occasion of  Eulogius' second imprisonment was as follows:--Leocritia, a maiden of  Arab extraction and of noble birth,[2] had been secretly baptised by  Liliosa, the wife of Felix. Her parents, learning her apostasy, cruelly  ill-treated, and even beat her, in order to make her renounce Christ.  She naturally turned to Eulogius and his sister Anulo for advice in her  afflictions, expressing a wish to escape to a part of Spain where the  Christian worship was free. As a first step to this, she leaves her  parents under pretence of going to a wedding, and takes refuge with  Eulogius. Her parents, furious at her escape, get all sorts of people  imprisoned on the charge of aiding her; and she is at last betrayed and  surprised at the house of her protector. They are both dragged before  the Kadi, who asks Eulogius angrily why he persists in defying the laws  in this way.[3] The bishop defends himself by pleading that Christian  clergy are bound to impart a knowledge of their religion, if asked, as  he had been by Leocritia.[4] The judge then threatens to have him  scourged, but Eulogius, preferring death to so painful and degrading a  punishment, repeats the lesson which he had taught to so many others,  and reviles Mohammed. Even so the judge shows a disposition to treat him  with leniency, and he is remanded to prison with Leocritia.    When brought up again before the royal Council,[5] an influential friend  makes a last effort to save him, saying: \"Fools and idiots rush on their  own destruction, but what induces you, a man of approved wisdom and  blameless character, in defiance of all natural instincts, to throw away  your life in this manner?\" He urges Eulogius to say but one word of  concession in the hour of peril, promising that he should afterwards be  free to exercise his religion as he pleased, without let or hindrance.  But the bishop could hardly turn back now, and he rejected all such  offers with the ejaculation, \"If they only knew the joy that awaits us  on high!\"        [1] See Eulog., Letter to Alvar, Florez, xi. 295.        [2] Alvar, Life of Eulog., i. sec. 13.        [3] Alvar, \"Life of Eulog.,\" i. secs. 14, 15.        [4] This kind of proselytism was not held to be a capital crime      by the Moslems. See Dozy, ii. 171.        [5] Alvar, \"Life of Eul.,\" v. sec. 15. Fleury v. 548.    On his way to execution, when struck by one of the bystanders on one  cheek, he turned the other meekly to the striker. He was beheaded on  March 11, 859, and Leocritia four days later. Miraculous appearances  honoured the body of the martyred bishop, which was buried in the Church  of St Genesius, whence it was translated in the next year to his own  church of St Zoilus, and in 883 was given up, together with that of  Leocritia, to Alphonso III. (866-910) by express stipulation.          CHAPTER V.    CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE MARTYRS.      With the death of Eulogius the series of voluntary martyrdoms comes to  an end, and it will be convenient at this point to consider the whole  question of the relation of the Church to the civil power, and how far  those \"confessors,\" who were put to death under the circumstances  already related, were entitled to the name of martyrs. Unfortunately the  evidence we have on the subject is drawn almost entirely from the  apologists of their doings, and therefore may fairly be suspected of  some bias. Yet even from them can be shown conclusively enough that no  real persecution was raging in Mohammedan Spain at this time, such as to  justify the extreme measures adopted by the party of zealots.    If we except the cases of John and Adulphus, and of Nunilo and Alodia,  the date of which is doubtful, there is not a single recorded instance  of a Christian being put to death for his religion by the Arabs in  Spain before the middle of the ninth century. The Muzarabes,[1] as the  Christians living under the Arabs were called, enjoyed a remarkable  degree of freedom in the exercise of their religion--the services and  rites of the Church being conducted as heretofore.[2] In Cordova alone  we find mention of the following churches:[3] the Church of St Acislus,  a former martyr of Cordova; of St Zoilus; of the Three  Martyrs--Faustus, Januarius, Martialis; of St Cyprian; of SS. Genesius  and Eulalia; and of the Virgin Mary.        [1] De Gayangos on Al Makk., i. p. 420, says the word means      \"those who try to imitate the Arabs in manners and language.\"        [2] Eulog. Letter to Alvar. After the "]]]
