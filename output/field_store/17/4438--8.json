The hair on the  lower joints of the leg is in turn lighter, being about the same shade  as that on the loins. The fore-arm is concealed in a mass of almost  black hair, which gradually shades lighter from the elbow upward and  along the whole region of the humerus. On the shoulder itself the hair  is pale yellow or straw-color (Naples yellow + yellow ocher), which  extends down in a point toward the elbow. From the back of the head a  conspicuous baud of curly, dark-brown hair extends back like a mane  along the neck and to the top of the hump, beyond which it soon fades  out.    The hair on the head is everywhere a rich burnt-sienna brown, except  around the corners of the mouth, where it shades into black.    The horns of the cow bison are slender, but solid for about two-thirds  of their length from the tip, ringed with age near their base, and quite  black. Very often they are imperfect in shape, and out of every five  pairs at least one is generally misshapen. Usually one horn is  \"crumpled,\" _e. g._, dwarfed in length and unnaturally thickened at the  base, and very often one horn is found to be merely an unsightly,  misshapen stub.

Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by  permission of the publishers.]    The udder of the cow bison is very small, as might be expected of an  animal which must do a great deal of hard traveling, but the milk is  said to be very rich. Some authorities declare that it requires the  milk of two domestic cows to satisfy one buffalo calf, but this, I  think, is an error. Our calf began in May to consume 6 quarts of  domestic milk daily, which by June 10 had increased to 8, and up to July  10, 9 quarts was the utmost it could drink. By that time it began to eat  grass, but the quantity of milk disposed of remained about the same.    +---------------------------------------------------------------+  |                       BISON AMERICANUS.                       |  |(Adult cow, eight years old.

While most Rocky Mountain hunters consider the  bison of the mountains quite distinct from that of the plains, it must  be remarked that no two authorities quite agree in regard to the  distinguishing characters of the variety they recognize. Colonel Dodge  states that \"His body is lighter, whilst his legs are shorter, but much  thicker and stronger, than the plains animal, thus enabling him to  perform feats of climbing and tumbling almost incredible in such a huge  and unwieldy beast.\"[32]    [Note 32: Plains of the Great West, p. 144.]    The belief in the existence of a distinct mountain variety is quite  common amongst hunters and frontiersmen all along the eastern slope the  Rocky Mountains as far north as the Peace River. In this connection the  following from Professor Henry Youle Hind[33] is of general interest:    [Note 33: Red River, Assinniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition, II p.  104-105.]    \"The existence of two kinds of buffalo is firmly believed by many  hunters at Red River; they are stated to be the prairie buffalo and the  buffalo of the woods. Many old hunters with whom I have conversed on  this subject aver that the so-called wood buffalo is a distinct species,  and although they are not able to offer scientific proofs, yet the  difference in size, color, hair, and horns, are enumerated as the  evidence upon which they base their statement. Men from their youth  familiar with these animals in the great plains, and the varieties which  are frequently met with in large herds, still cling to this opinion. The  buffalo of the plains are not always of the dark and rich bright brown  which forms their characteristic color. They are sometimes seen from  white to almost black, and a gray buffalo is not at all uncommon.  Buffalo emasculated by wolves are often found on the prairies, where  they grow to an immense size; the skin of the buffalo ox is recognized  by the shortness of the wool and by its large dimensions. The skin of  the so-called wood buffalo is much larger than that of the common  animal, the hair is very short, mane or hair about the neck short and  soft, and altogether destitute of curl, which is the common feature in  the hair or wool of the prairie animal. Two skins of the so-called wood  buffalo, which I saw at Selkirk Settlement, bore a very close  resemblance to the skin of the Lithuanian bison, judging from the  specimens of that species which I have since had an opportunity of  seeing in the British Museum.    \"The wood buffalo is stated to be very scarce, and only found north of  the Saskatchewan and on the flanks of the Rocky Mountains. It never  ventures into the open plains. The prairie buffalo, on the contrary,  generally avoids the woods in summer and keeps to the open country; but  in winter they are frequently found in the woods of the Little Souris,  Saskatchewan, the Touchwood Hills, and the aspen groves on the  Qu'Appelle. There is no doubt that formerly the prairie buffalo ranged  through open woods almost as much as he now does through the prairies.\"    Mr. Harrison S. Young, an officer of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company,  stationed at Fort Edmonton, writes me as follows in a letter dated  October 22, 1887: \"In our district of Athabasca, along the Salt River,  there are still a few wood buffalo killed every year; but they are fast  diminishing in numbers, and are also becoming very shy.\"    In Prof. John Macoun's \"Manitoba and the Great Northwest,\" page 342,  there occurs the following reference to the wood buffalo: \"In the winter  of 1870 the last buffalo were killed north of Peace River; but in 1875  about one thousand head were still in existence between the Athabasca  and Peace Rivers, north of Little Slave Lake. These are called wood  buffalo by the hunters, but diner only in size from those of the plain.\"    In the absence of facts based on personal observations, I may be  permitted to advance an opinion in regard to the wood buffalo. There is  some reason for the belief that certain changes of form may have taken  place in the buffaloes that have taken up a permanent residence in  rugged and precipitous mountain regions. Indeed, it is hardly possible  to understand how such a radical change in the habitat of an animal  could fail, through successive generations, to effect certain changes in  the animal itself. It seems to me that the changes which would take  place in a band of plains buffaloes transferred to a permanent mountain  habitat can be forecast with a marked degree of certainty. The changes  that take place under such conditions in cattle, swine, and goats are  well known, and similar causes would certainly produce similar results  in the buffalo.    The scantier feed of the mountains, and the great waste of vital energy  called for in procuring it, would hardly produce a larger buffalo than  the plains-fed animal, who acquires an abundance of daily food of the  best quality with but little effort.    We should expect to see the mountain buffalo smaller in body than the  plains animal, with better leg development, and particularly with  stronger hind quarters. The pelvis of the plains buffalo is surprisingly  small and weak for so large an animal. Beyond question, constant  mountain climbing is bound to develop a maximum of useful muscle and  bone and a minimum of useless fat. If the loss of mane sustained by the  African lions who live in bushy localities may be taken as an index, we  should expect the bison of the mountains, especially the \"wood buffalo,\"  to lose a great deal of his shaggy frontlet and mane on the bushes and  trees which surrounded him. Therefore, we would naturally expect to find  the hair on those parts shorter and in far less perfect condition than  on the bison of the treeless prairies. By reason of the more shaded  condition of his home, and the decided mitigation of the sun's  fierceness, we should also expect to see his entire pelage of a darker  tone. That he would acquire a degree of agility and strength unknown in  his relative of the plain is reasonably certain. In the course of many  centuries the change in his form might become well defined, constant,  and conspicuous; but at present there is apparently not the slightest  ground for considering that the \"mountain buffalo\" or \"wood buffalo\" is  entitled to rank even as a variety of _Bison americanus_.    Colonel Dodge has recorded some very interesting information in regard  to the \"mountain, or wood buffalo,\" which deserves to be quoted  entire.[34]    [Note 34: Plains of the Great West, p. 144-147.]    \"In various portions of the Rocky Mountains, especially in the region of  the parks, is found an animal which old mountaineers call the 'bison."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#12)"],[1,"an inscription in raised letters nearly two inches long, and the date  being perfectly distinct is 1257 written thus, MCCLVII. The two last  characters have dropped, but the impression of them is clearly visible;  the inscription itself is difficult to decypher, it is in Latin, and  some of the letters are missing, others so curiously formed as to render  them doubtful exactly as to their import. The greater part of the  characters are Roman, the others resemble more the Saxon, yet are not  quite so; at all events I recommend the inscription to the attention of  the curious. A vast space, which is now covered with streets, commencing  at the Rue des Saints Peres, and extending to the Invalids, consisted  entirely of meadows, and was called the Pre aux Clercs, or the Clerks'  Field, from the students and a number of young men who possessed some  education, usually enjoying their recreations in this spot, but  certainly not in the most innocent manner, in fact, the disorders  committed in this privileged piece of ground, which the students  considered as their own, were such as to be often named in history, and  to have formed the subject of a favourite Melo Drama; it retained its  character as being the scene of turbulence and disorder even to the  time of Louis XIV.    Amongst other useful undertakings effected by Philippe Auguste was that  of establishing markets with covered stalls, and he it was that first  conceived the idea of paving Paris, which he partially effected, and  surrounded the town with a wall, part of which is still standing in the  Rue Clovis. Paris increased and flourished under his reign; he in fact  did all that was possible to augment its prosperity, and amongst other  measures he granted the utmost protection in his power to the students,  knowing that the more the population of the city increased, the more  flourishing was its condition; by such means he induced scholars to come  in numbers from the most distant parts to study in the colleges of  Paris, two of which he erected, as well as three hospitals; he also  instituted many good laws, which protected the tradespeople and  repressed the robberies and extortions of the nobles. But Paris was  still subject to calamities, a flood having occurred from the  overflowing of the Seine, which reached as high as the second floor  windows of some houses. A great part of Paris was occupied with  monasteries and convents, which with their gardens covered an immense  space; in the course of time, however, the monks found it advantageous  to dispose of their lands for the purpose of building dwelling-houses,  and in the Revolution numbers were suppressed; and in some quarters of  the city there are warehouses in the occupation of different tradesmen,  which formerly formed part of the old monasteries. Many of the streets  by their names still indicate the order of the convents by which they  were occupied, as the Rue Blanc Manteaux (White Cloaks), Rue des Saints  Peres (Holy Fathers), Filles de Dieu (Daughters of God), which now is  one of the narrowest and dirtiest streets in Paris, and inhabited by  daughters of a very different description. Such are the extraordinary  changes which time effects. Philippe Auguste dying in 1223, was  succeeded by his son Louis VIII, surnamed the Lion, whose short reign of  four years was occupied by war, leaving no leisure for effecting any  great improvement in Paris; but under his successor Lewis IX, styled  Saint-Louis, much was effected, although his efforts were principally  directed towards the erection of religious institutions, being much  under the dominion of the priests, and naturally possessing a fanatic  zeal. Churches at that period were too often but monuments of  superstition for the celebration of mummery, for sheltering criminals,  receptacles for pretended relics, and in fact instruments for  maintaining the power of priestcraft. This same Saint Louis, so lauded  by some authors, had some excellent notions of his own, and was very  fond of practising summary justice, recommending to his nobles that  whenever they met with any one who expressed any doubts regarding the  Christian religion, never to argue with the sceptist, but immediately  plunge their swords into his body.    Rhetoric at this period was a study much followed and admired, but the  logic of Saint-Louis, I suspect, was the most forcible and best  calculated to remove all doubts, having a great objection to language  that was what some persons would style far too energetic; where an oath  was suffered to escape, he ordered the intemperate orator's tongue to be  pierced with a hot iron and his lips burnt; hence many of his subjects  were compelled to endure that operation; but this was considered in  those days all very saint-like. They had strange ideas in some  instances, in days of yore, according to our present notion of words and  things. Louis the First, surnamed the _Debonnaire_ (the gentle), had his  nephew Bernard's eyes bored out; this act was certainly very like a  _gentle_ man. Hugh the Great, so called on account of his splendid  virtues, in the year 1014 thought it proper that he should be present at  the burning of a few heretics, and his lady, with her ardent religious  zeal, stepped forward and poked out the eye of her confessor, who was  one of the victims, with her walking cane, before he was committed to  the flames. Louis however had some redeeming qualities; he founded the  Hospital of the Quinze-Vingts, which still exists; he also enlarged and  improved the Hotel Dieu, the principal hospital in those days, in which  he even exceeded the munificence of his predecessor, Philippe Auguste,  who published an ordonnance commanding that all the straw which had been  used in his chamber should be given to the Hotel Dieu, whenever he  quitted Paris and no longer wanted it; such overpowering kindness one  would imagine must have had the effect of curing some of the invalids  who were capable of appreciating the high honour conferred upon them, in  being suffered to lie upon straw which had been trodden by royal feet.  Saint Louis also founded the celebrated College of the Sorbonne, which  is still existing, and maintains a high character; he also built the  curious and interesting chapel adjoining the Palais de Justice, which is  well worth the amateur's attention; he founded the Hospital of Les  Filles de Dieu, for the purpose of reclaiming women of improper conduct.  The Mendicant Monks, the Augustines, and the Carmes were established in  France during his reign, and he founded the convents of the Beguines,  Mathurins, Jacobins, Carthusians, Cordeliers, and several others of  minor importance, in Paris, with the chapels attached to them; besides  different churches with which I shall not tire my reader with  recapitulating, as there are none of them now standing, except the  chapel belonging to the Palais de Justice; he also added several  fountains, contributing to the comforts of the Parisians, as well as  embellishing their city. The number of churches which have been  demolished in Paris within the last fifty years, exceeds the number of  those which are now standing, many of them during the Revolution, which  might have been expected; but an equal number under the Restoration in  the reigns of Louis the Eighteenth and Charles the Tenth, who being  rather devotees, one would have imagined might have been induced to  repair and preserve all religious monuments, also highly interesting as  specimens of the architecture of the different ages in which they were  founded. Louis Philippe has better kept up the spirit of the  _restoration_ in having rescued from demolition the ancient and  beautiful church of St Germain l'Auxerrois; which was to have been  pulled down to make way for a new street, according to the plan  projected by his predecessor; instead of which, it has been repaired  with the greatest judgment, carefully preserving the original style of  the building wherever ornaments or statues required to be renewed. Thus  this noble edifice has been preserved to the public, which would not  have been the case had the Revolution of the Three Days not occurred, as  its doom was sealed prior to that period. In fact, since the accession  to the throne of Louis Philippe, I do not believe that any church has  been pulled down, though several others have been built, and others  finished, which have greatly added to the embellishments of the city.  The memory of Louis IX has ever been cherished as that of a Saint, and  if a man be judged by the number of religious establishments he  instituted, certainly he deserved to be canonised; but however grand may  be the reputation of having founded and erected so many public  monuments, yet when it is considered that numbers of the inmates of the  different convents and monasteries erected by this Saint were obliged to  demand alms from house to house, and of persons passing along the  streets, it will be proved that the grand result of Saint Louis'  operations was to fill Paris with beggars; although it certainly must be  admitted that some of his other acts in a great degree compensated for  those into which he was led by superstition and religious fanaticism: he  was succeeded by his son Philippe the Bold in 1270, who suffered himself  to be governed by his favourite, La Brosse, formerly a barber, in which  it must be admitted that Philippe displayed rather a _barbarous_ taste,  which ended in his pet being hanged; his reign, however, was signalised  by the establishment of a College of Surgeons, who were designated by  the appellation of Surgeons of the Long Robe, whilst the barbers were  styled Surgeons of the Short Robe; he also recalled the Jews, whom his  father, after having persecuted in divers manners, banished and  confiscated their property; amongst other indignities which were put  upon them by Saint Louis, was that of forcing them to wear a patch of  red"]]]
