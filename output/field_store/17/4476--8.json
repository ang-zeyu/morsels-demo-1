The wall of the  right ventricle may now be raised and the cavity exposed. Observe the  extent of the cavity, its shape, its lining, its columns of muscles, its  half columns of muscles, its tendons (chordae tendineae), the tricuspid  valve from the under side, etc. Also notice the valve at the beginning of  the pulmonary artery (the right semilunar) and the sinuses, or  depressions, in the artery immediately behind its divisions.    6. Now cut through the middle of the loosened ventricular wall from the  apex to the middle of the right auricle, laying it open for observation.  Observe the openings into the auricle, there being one each for the vena  cava superior, the vena cava inferior, and the coronary vein. Compare the  walls, lining, shape, size, etc., with the ventricle below.    7. Cut off the end of the left ventricle about an inch above the apex.  This will show the extension of the cavity to the apex; it will also show  the thickness of the walls and the shape of the cavity. Split up the  ventricular wall far enough to examine the mitral valve and the chordae  tendineae from the lower side.    8. Make an incision in the left auricle. Examine its inner surface and  find the places of entrance of the pulmonary veins. Examine the mitral  valve from above. Compare the two sides of the heart, part for part.    9. Separate the aorta from the other blood vessels and cut it entirely  free from the heart, care being taken to leave enough of the heart  attached to the artery to insure the semilunar valve's being left in good  condition. After tying or plugging up the holes in the sides of the  artery, pour water into the small end and observe the closing of the  semilunar valve. Repeat the experiment until the action of the valve is  understood. Sketch the artery, showing the valve in a closed condition.    *To illustrate the Action of a Ventricle.*--Procure a syringe bulb with an  opening at each end. Connect a rubber tube with each opening, letting the  tubes reach into two tumblers containing water. By alternately compressing  and releasing the bulb, water is pumped from one vessel into the other.  The bulb may be taken to represent one of the ventricles. What action of  the ventricle is represented by compressing the bulb? By releasing the  pressure? Show by a sectional drawing the arrangement of the valves in the  syringe bulb.                                    [Fig. 25]                     Fig. 25--Illustrating elasticity of arteries.      *To show the Advantage of the Elasticity of Arteries.*--Connect the syringe  bulb used in the last experiment with a rubber tube three or four feet in  length and having rather thin walls. In the opposite end of the rubber  tube insert a short glass tube which has been drawn (by heating) to a fine  point (Fig. 25). Pump water into the rubber tube, observing:    1. The swelling of the tube (pulse) as the water is forced into it. (This  is best observed by placing the fingers on the tube.)    2. The forcing of water from the pointed tubs during the interval when no  pressure is being applied from the bulb. Compare with the action of the  arteries when blood is forced into them from the ventricles.    Repeat the experiment, using a long glass tube terminating in a point  instead of the rubber tube. (In fitting the glass tube to the bulb use a  very short rubber tube.) Observe and account for the differences in the  flow of water through the inelastic tube.    *To show the Advantage of Valves in the Veins.*--Attach an open glass tube  one foot in length to each end of the rubber tube used in the preceding  experiment and fill with water (by sucking) to within about six inches of  the end. Lay on the table with the glass tubes secured in an upright  position (Fig. 26). Now compress the tube with the hand, noting that the  water rises in both tubes, being pushed in both directions. This effect is  similar to that produced on the blood when a vein having no valves is  compressed.                                    [Fig. 26]        Fig. 26.--*Simple apparatus* for showing advantage of valves in veins.      Now imitate the action of a valve by clamping the tube at one point, or by  closing it by pressure from the finger, and then compressing with the hand  some portion of the tube on the table. Observe in this instance that the  water is *all* pushed in the same direction. The movement of the water is  now like the effect produced on the blood in veins having valves when the  veins are compressed.    *To show the Position of the Valves in the Veins.*--Exercise the arm and  hand for a moment to increase the blood supply. Expose the forearm and  examine the veins on its surface. With a finger, stroke one of the veins  toward the heart, noting that, as the blood is pushed along on one side of  the finger the blood follows on the other side. Now stroke the vein toward  the hand. Places are found beyond which the blood does not follow the  finger. These mark the positions of valves.    *To show Effect of Exercise upon the Circulation.*--1. With a finger on the  \"pulse\" at the wrist or temple, count the number of heart beats during a  period of one minute under the following conditions: (_a_) when sitting;  (_b_) when standing; (_c_) after active exercise, as running. What  relation, if any, do these observations indicate between the general  activity of the body and the work of the heart?    2. Compare the size of the veins on the backs of the hands when they are  placed side by side on a table. Then exercise briskly the right hand and  arm, clenching and unclenching the fist and flexing the arm at the elbow.  Place the hands again side by side and, after waiting a minute, observe  the increase in the size of the veins in the hand exercised. How is this  accounted for?    *To Show the Effect of Gravity on the Circulation.*--Hold one hand high  above the head, at the same time letting the other hand hang loosely by  the side. Observe the difference in the color of the hands and the degree  to which the large veins are filled. Repeat the experiment, reversing the  position of the hands. What results are observed? In what parts of the  body does gravity aid in the return of the blood to the heart? In what  parts does it hinder? Where fainting is caused by lack of blood in the  brain (the usual cause), is it better to let the patient lie down flat or  to force him into a sitting posture?    *To study the Circulation in a Frog's Foot* (Optional).--A compound  microscope is needed in this study and for extended examination it is best  to destroy the frog's brain. This is done by inserting some blunt-pointed  instrument into the skull cavity from the neck and moving it about. A  small frog, on account of the thinness of its webs, gives the best  results. It should be attached to a thin board which has an opening in one  end over which the web of the foot may be stretched. Threads should extend  from two of the toes to pins driven into the board to secure the necessary  tension of the web, and the foot and lower leg should be kept moist. Using  a two-thirds-inch objective, observe the branching of the small arteries  into the capillaries and the union of the capillaries to form the small  veins. The appearance is truly wonderful, but allowance must be made for  the fact that the _motion_ of the blood is magnified, as well as the  different structures, and that it appears to move much faster than it  really does. With a still higher power, the movements of the corpuscles  through the capillaries may be studied.    NOTE.--To perform this experiment without destroying the brain, the frog is  first carefully wrapped with strips of wet cloth and securely tied to the  board. The wrapping, while preventing movements of the frog, must not  interfere with the circulation.          CHAPTER VI - THE LYMPH AND ITS MOVEMENT THROUGH THE BODY                                      [Fig. 27]        Fig. 27--*Diagram showing position of the lymph* with reference to the  blood and the cells. The central tube is a capillary. The arrows indicate               the direction of slight movements in the lymph.      The blood, it will be remembered, moves everywhere through the body in a  system of _closed_ tubes. These keep it from coming in contact with any of  the cells of the body except those lining the tubes themselves. The  capillaries, to be sure, bring the blood very near the cells of the  different tissues; still, there is need of a liquid to fill the space  between the capillaries and the cells and to transfer materials from one  to the other. The lymph occupies this position and does this work. The  position of the lymph with reference to the capillaries and the cells is  shown in Fig. 27.    *Origin of the Lymph.*--The chief source of the lymph is the plasma of the  blood. As before described, the walls of the capillaries consist of a  single layer of flat cells placed edge to edge. Partly on account of the  pressure upon the blood and partly on account of the natural tendency of  liquids to pass through animal membranes, a considerable portion of the  plasma penetrates the thin walls and enters the spaces occupied by the  lymph.    The cells themselves also help to form the lymph, since the water and  wastes leaving the cells add to its bulk. These mix with the plasma from  the blood, forming the resultant liquid which is the lymph. A considerable  amount of the material absorbed from the food canal also enters the lymph  tubes, but this passes into the blood before reaching the cells.    *Composition and Physical Properties of the Lymph.*(26)--As would naturally  be expected, the composition of the lymph is similar to that of the blood.  In fact, nearly all the important constituents of the blood are found in  the lymph, but in different proportions. Food materials for the cells are  present in smaller amounts than in the blood, while impurities from the  cells are in larger"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],[0,"The Insect Folk (#12)"],[1," this foul-smelling  liquid oozes out of the joints of the legs.    Yes, Mabel, it is probably used, like the \"molasses\" of other little  friends we know, to repel enemies.    But to return to breathing. Some larvae breathe by gills, and do not have  spiracles until they are grown up, but all grown-up insects breathe by  spiracles.    Yes, John, the larvae of the dragon flies and May flies breathe with  gills.    I thought you would remember that.    The water boatman breathes by spiracles, and carries his supply of air  with him. All grown-up bugs breathe by spiracles.    Now look down into the pond. I think you will see some water boatmen  anchored near the bottom.    Yes, May, they cling by their front feet. Their hind pair of legs are  rather odd-looking; they have a fringe of hairs on the inside.    John says their hind legs are modified to swim with.    Very good, John.    The hind legs are the oars that row these little boats about in the  water.    But why are the little boats that have come to anchor down there moving  their paddles so constantly?    Ah, yes; it is because they want fresh air to breathe.    You know there is always air in pond water, and they keep their paddles  moving, so as to change the envelope of air that surrounds them.    [Illustration]    They know what to do to take care of themselves, if they _are_ nothing  but little bugs.    When winter comes, they go down to the bottom of the pond and bury  themselves in the mud. They lie there without moving or breathing until  spring, when out they come, as lively as ever.    Yes, certain other animals pass the winter in this way; the bears, for  instance, find a snug den and sleep all through the coldest winter  weather. We call this winter sleep of animals hibernation, and many of  the insects hibernate.    Yes, Ned, hibernating animals can get on with very little air; they  sometimes seem to need none at all, and they take no food.    May wants to know what these queer water boatmen eat.    They suck out the juices of other insects.    They must lay their eggs in the water, little Nell thinks.    And so they do, on water plants.    Near the city of Mexico there are species that lay enormous quantities  of eggs in the ponds, and what do you think? The Indians mix these eggs  with meal, make them into cakes, and eat them.    The Mexican bugs are gathered by the ton, too, and sent to England as  food for cage birds, fish, and poultry.    Little Nell thinks there must be a great many bugs in a ton. Indeed,  there are, probably about twenty-five millions of them; so you can  imagine Mexico is well supplied with water boatmen!    When the young ones hatch out they look like their parents, only, of  course, they are tiny little dots of things that have no wings.    But they eat and grow and moult like other larvae until they are  full-grown insects.    What have you discovered, Ned? You look surprised.    The water boatman has no antennae!    It doesn't seem to have any. But look carefully and I think you will  find some tiny ones tucked away under its head.    Nell wants to know if the water boatman has a thorax and an abdomen.    Indeed, it has, but you will have to look carefully to see them. Its  abdomen is short and thick and hard. The water boatman is much more  compact in form than the Orthoptera, or any of the other insects we have  studied.    You are right, John, an insect with a long abdomen, like the  grasshopper, could not get on very well in the water.    Now, May, take the cover off the tumbler. There!    Our water boatman was not slow to make use of his wings.    Well, good-by and good luck to you, little water boatman.    [Illustration]          THE FUNNY BACK-SWIMMERS      What, John? You know a water boatman that swims on its back?    That makes Nell laugh, and no wonder.    Yes, there is a little bug that swims on its back.    [Illustration]    It is very much like the water boatman, and it has long paddles made of  its queer hind legs.    Unlike the water boatman, however, its back is not flat but is shaped  like the keel of a boat.    This being the case, it just turns over and swims with its keel-shaped  back in the water.    It is sometimes called the back-swimmer, and most boys are well  acquainted with it.    What do you think about catching it in your fingers, Ned?    Ah, you do not like to!    It has a very sharp beak for sucking the life out of other insects, and  if you succeed in getting hold of it, it will stick that into your  finger.    And my! how it does sting!    It is not an easy matter to catch it, however,--it is such a quick  little rascal.          THE GIANT WATER BUG    [Illustration]      A good many kinds of bugs live in the water, but perhaps the oddest of  all is the giant water bug.    It _is_ a giant!    Have you ever seen very large, flat brown bugs lying on the ground under  the electric street lamps?    Those are the giant water bugs.    They fly in the night from pond to pond, and are attracted by bright  lights.    They fly into the electric lights, and are killed in great numbers  sometimes.    This is such a common habit with them that in some places they are  called electric light bugs.    A good many people never saw these bugs until they were found dead  under the electric lights, and so they imagined they did not exist until  electric lights were invented.    But that is a very foolish notion; the bugs were here thousands of years  before electric lights were dreamed of.    The giant water bugs are not pleasant to handle when alive.    If you ever succeed in catching one in the water, which is not easy,  they slip about so quickly, be sure and not take it in your fingers.    The California children call a species they have there \"toe-biters,\" and  they say they bite their toes when they go in wading.    The giant water bugs are the largest of living bugs, and they even kill  and eat fish.    Their fore legs can shut up like a jackknife. The tibia shuts into a  groove in the femur, and thus the bug is able to seize and hold its  prey.    It clasps its victim in its arms, as it were, and calmly proceeds to  suck out its blood.    In some species of the giant water bugs the female does not leave her  eggs in the pond to take care of themselves; she puts them on the back  of her mate, who is obliged to carry all of his progeny about with him  until they relieve him by hatching out and swimming off to see life for  themselves.          LITTLE MRS. SHORE BUG    [Illustration]      May says she wants to hear more about bugs. Well, there is little Mrs.  Shore Bug. I think you must all know her.    She is the little bug that flies along in front of you on the seashore,  or, indeed, on the edge of any body of water.    She flits along just in front of you, and is so quick in her motions  that you will hardly ever catch her.    She does not fly far--she alights just far enough ahead to make you try  again to capture her, but when you think you have her, she isn't there!    [Illustration]    She has sped off on one of her short flights, and so she will continue  to do as long as you continue to chase her.          THE AIRY WATER STRIDERS      Then there are the water striders.    They are bugs, and it is easy to guess how they got their name.    You surely remember the longlegged, dark colored fellows that straddle  about on top of the water, in ponds or in still pools in streams?    Who has not tried to catch them!    And how very seldom any one succeeds!    May knows where we can see some water striders close at hand.    They are on the pond in the meadow. Let us go.    Ah, you little ones! There you are, scampering over the water on your  airy, fairy feet, as though you were on dry land.    [Illustration]    How they flash about! And what cunning dimples their little feet make on  the water when they stand still!    If we keep very quiet, they will stop darting about in that wild way,  and we can see them better.    Now, water striders, why do you behave so, and what do you eat?    Eat? Why, insects, of course. And as to behavior, they may well wonder  more at ours than we at theirs.    They skate about on the surface of the water all summer, and when winter  comes they hide away at the bottom of the pond, right under the water,  or along the edges of the banks.    When the warm spring sunshine wakes up the sleeping plants, then the  little water striders wake up too.    Out they come, to resume their endless skating and insect catching, but  now they lay their eggs, gluing them fast to water weeds.    The young water striders look like their parents, and they, too, like to  go circling and flashing over the top of the water, with their long legs  spread out.          A QUEER FELLOW      What do you suppose is in this box?    Little Nell may open it.    There, out he comes--slowly, as though he were looking around and  thinking about it.    [Illustration]    May says, \"Hello, Mr. Walking Stick, you here again?\"    Ho! ho! _is_ it Mr. Walking Stick?    You look again.    Mollie thinks, if she were going to name it, she would call it Mr.  Walking Threads.    Yes, it is more slender than even the walking stick.    What is that, John? You thought insects had six legs, and this has only  four?    Now, here is something for us to think about.    Ned says it has six long threads that might be legs, but it does not  walk on the two front ones.    It seems to use them as antennae.    [Illustration]    Ned says those front ones look to him to be jointed just like the  others, and he thinks they are legs.    Mollie says they have no little feet like the others, and she thinks  they are antennae.    Well, well, what are we to do? Think of its having feelers that look  like legs or legs that look like feelers, so that you cannot tell which  they are!    Now it is beginning to move, and--Oh, ho, that long part in front is not  its head!    [Illustration]    See, it separates into two--what?    Surely,"]]]
