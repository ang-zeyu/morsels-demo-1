For that scar was his own mark, dealt to  this man, whose name was not Smith, and who had been as evil as he  looked, and whose nomadic life was not due to remorse or love of travel.    Wade passed on without being seen. This recognition meant less to him  than it would have ten years ago, as he was not now the kind of man who  hunted old enemies for revenge or who went to great lengths to keep out  of their way. Men there were in Colorado who would shoot at him on  sight. There had been more than one that had shot to his cost.           *       *       *       *       *    That night Wade camped in the foothills east of Elgeria, and upon the  following day, at sunrise, his horses were breaking the frosty grass and  ferns of the timbered range. This he crossed, rode down into a valley  where a lonely cabin nestled, and followed an old, blazed trail that  wound up the course of a brook. The water was of a color that made rock  and sand and moss seem like gold. He saw no signs or tracks of game. A  gray jay now and then screeched his approach to unseen denizens of the  woods. The stream babbled past him over mossy ledges, under the dark  shade of clumps of spruces, and it grew smaller as he progressed toward  its source. At length it was lost in a swale of high, rank grass, and  the blazed trail led on through heavy pine woods. At noon he reached the  crest of the divide, and, halting upon an open, rocky eminence, he gazed  down over a green and black forest, slow-descending to a great irregular  park that was his destination for the night.    Wade needed meat, and to that end, as he went on, he kept a sharp  lookout for deer, especially after he espied fresh tracks crossing the  trail. Slipping along ahead of his horses, that followed, him almost too  closely to permit of his noiseless approach to game, he hunted all the  way down to the great open park without getting a shot.    This park was miles across and miles long, covered with tall, waving  grass, and it had straggling arms that led off into the surrounding belt  of timber. It sloped gently toward the center, where a round, green  acreage of grass gave promise of water. Wade rode toward this, keeping  somewhat to the right, as he wanted to camp at the edge of the woods.  Soon he rode out beyond one of the projecting peninsulas of forest to  find the park spreading wider in that direction. He saw horses grazing  with elk, and far down at the notch, where evidently the park had outlet  in a narrow valley, he espied the black, hump-shaped, shaggy forms of  buffalo. They bobbed off out of sight. Then the elk saw or scented him,  and they trotted away, the antlered bulls ahead of the cows. Wade  wondered if the horses were wild. They showed great interest, but no  fear. Beyond them was a rising piece of ground, covered with pine, and  it appeared to stand aloft from the forest on the far side as well as  upon that by which he was approaching. Riding a mile or so farther he  ascertained that this bit of wooded ground resembled an island in a  lake. Presently he saw smoke arising above the treetops.    A tiny brook welled out of the green center of the park and meandered  around to pass near the island of pines. Wade saw unmistakable signs of  prospecting along this brook, and farther down, where he crossed it, he  found tracks made that day.    The elevated plot of ground appeared to be several acres in extent,  covered with small-sized pines, and at the far edge there was a little  log cabin. Wade expected to surprise a lone prospector at his evening  meal. As he rode up a dog ran out of the cabin, barking furiously. A  man, dressed in fringed buckskin, followed. He was tall, and had long,  iron-gray hair over his shoulders. His bronzed and weather-beaten face  was a mass of fine wrinkles where the grizzled hair did not hide them,  and his shining, red countenance proclaimed an honest, fearless spirit.    \"Howdy, stranger!\" he called, as Wade halted several rods distant. His  greeting was not welcome, but it was civil. His keen scrutiny, however,  attested to more than his speech.    \"Evenin', friend,\" replied Wade. \"Might I throw my pack here?\"    \"Sure. Get down,\" answered the other. \"I calkilate I never seen you in  these diggin's.\"    \"No. I'm Bent Wade, an' on my way to White Slides to work for  Belllounds.\"    \"Glad to meet you. I'm new hereabouts, myself, but I know Belllounds. My  name's Lewis. I was jest cookin' grub. An' it'll burn, too, if I don't  rustle. Turn your hosses loose an' come in.\"    Wade presented himself with something more than his usual methodical  action. He smelled buffalo steak, and he was hungry. The cabin had been  built years ago, and was a ramshackle shelter at best. The stone  fireplace, however, appeared well preserved. A bed of red coals glowed  and cracked upon the hearth.    \"Reckon I sure smelled buffalo meat,\" observed Wade, with much  satisfaction. \"It's long since I chewed a hunk of that.\"    \"All ready. Now pitch in.... Yes, thar's some buffalo left in here. Not  hunted much. Thar's lots of elk an' herds of deer. After a little snow  you'd think a drove of sheep had been trackin' around. An' some bear.\"    Wade did not waste many words until he had enjoyed that meal. Later,  while he helped his host, he recurred to the subject of game.    \"If there's so many deer then there's lions an' wolves.\"    \"You bet. I see tracks every day. Had a shot at a lofer not long ago.  Missed him. But I reckon thar's more varmints over in the Troublesome  country back of White Slides.\"    \"Troublesome! Do they call it that?\" asked Wade, with a queer smile.    \"Sure. An' it is troublesome. Belllounds has been tryin' to hire a  hunter. Offered me big wages to kill off the wolves an' lions.\"    \"That's the job I'm goin' to take.\"    \"Good!\" exclaimed Lewis. \"I'm sure glad. Belllounds is a nice fellar. I  felt sort of cheap till I told him I wasn't really a hunter. You see,  I'm prospectin' up here, an' pretendin' to be a hunter.\"    \"What do you make that bluff for?\" queried Wade.    \"You couldn't fool any one who'd ever prospected for gold. I saw your  signs out here.\"    \"Wal, you've sharp eyes, thet's all. Wade, I've some ondesirable  neighbors over here. I'd just as lief they didn't see me diggin' gold.  Lately I've had a hunch they're rustlin' cattle. Anyways, they've sold  cattle in Kremmlin' thet came from over around Elgeria.\"    \"Wherever there's cattle there's sure to be some stealin',\" observed  Wade.    \"Wal, you needn't say anythin' to Belllounds, because mebbe I'm wrong.  An' if I found out I was right I'd go down to White Slides an' tell it  myself. Belllounds done some favors.\"    \"How far to White Slides?\" asked Wade, with a puff on his pipe.    \"Roundabout trail, an' rough, but you'll make it in one day, easy.  Beautiful country. Open, big peaks an' ranges, with valleys an' lakes.  Never seen such grass!\"    \"Did you ever see Belllounds's son?\"    \"No. Didn't know he hed one. But I seen his gal the fust day I was thar.  She was nice to me. I went thar to be fixed up a bit. Nearly chopped my  hand off. The gal--Columbine, she's called--doctored me up. Fact is, I  owe considerable to thet White Slides Ranch. There's a cowboy, Wils  somethin', who rode up here with some medicine fer me--some they didn't  have when I was thar. You'll like thet boy. I seen he was sweet on the  gal an' I sure couldn't blame him.\"    Bent Wade removed his pipe and let out a strange laugh, significant with  its little note of grim confirmation.    \"What's funny about thet?\" demanded Lewis, rather surprised.    \"I was only laughin',\" replied Wade. \"What you said about the cowboy  bein' sweet on the girl popped into my head before you told it. Well,  boys will be boys. I was young once an' had my day.\"    Lewis grunted as he bent over to lift a red coal to light his pipe, and  as he raised his head he gave Wade a glance of sympathetic curiosity.    \"Wal, I hope I'll see more of you,\" he said, as his guest rose,  evidently to go.    \"Reckon you will, as I'll be chasin' hounds all over. An' I want a look  at them neighbors you spoke of that might be rustlers.... I'll turn in  now. Good night.\"        CHAPTER V    Bent Wade rode out of the forest to look down upon the White Slides  country at the hour when it was most beautiful.    \"Never seen the beat of that!\" he exclaimed, as he halted.    The hour was sunset, with the golden rays and shadows streaking ahead of  him down the rolling sage hills, all rosy and gray with rich, strange  softness. Groves of aspens stood isolated from one another--here  crowning a hill with blazing yellow, and there fringing the brow of  another with gleaming gold, and lower down reflecting the sunlight with  brilliant red and purple. The valley seemed filled with a delicate haze,  almost like smoke. White Slides Ranch was hidden from sight, as it lay  in the bottomland. The gray old peak towered proud and aloof, clear-cut  and sunset-flushed against the blue. The eastern slope of the valley was  a vast sweep of sage and hill and grassy bench and aspen bench, on fire  with the colors of autumn made molten by the last flashing of the sun.  Great black slopes of forest gave sharp contrast, and led up to the  red-walled ramparts of the mountain range.    Wade watched the scene until the fire faded, the golden shafts paled and  died, the rosy glow on sage changed to cold steel gray. Then he rode out  upon the foothills. The trail led up and down slopes of sage. Grass grew  thicker as he descended. Once he startled a great flock of  prairie-chickens, or sage-hens, large gray birds, lumbering, swift  fliers, that whirred up, and soon plumped down again into the sage.  Twilight found him on a last long slope of the foothills, facing the  pasture-land of the valley, with the ranch still five miles distant, now  showing misty and dim in the gathering shadows.

The Church also  hath a power to be exercised, for calling them to their duty, and  keeping them in their duty according to the word of God: as, to _rebuke  them before all_, that sin before all, 1 Tim. v. 20: to prove deacons,  Acts vi. 2, 3, &c.; 1 Tim. iii. 10: _to ordain elders_, Tit. i. 5; Acts  xiv. 23: to use the _keys of the kingdom of heaven_, in the dispensing  of all ordinances, Matt, xviii. 18-20, and John xx. 21, 23, with Matt,  xxviii. 18-20: and, in a word, (as the cause shall require,) to judge of  all them that are within the Church, 1 Cor. v. 12.    This is the power and authority wherein the nature of church government  generally doth consist.    2. That all governments in Scripture are styled by the common names of  power or authority: e.g. the absolute government of God over all things,  is power, Acts i. 7: the supreme government of Jesus Christ, is power,  Matt, xxviii. 18; Rev. xii. 10: the political government of the  magistrate in commonwealths, is power, as John xix. 10; Rom. xiii. 1-3;  Luke xxiii. 7: the military government of soldiers under superior  commanders, is power, &c., Matt. viii. 9: the family government that the  master of a family hath over his household, is power, 1 Tim. iii. 5, \"If  any man know not how to rule his own house.\" Yea, the very tyrannical  rule that sin and Satan exercise over carnal men, is styled power, Acts  xxvi. 18; Col. i. 13. Thus, generally, all sorts of government are  commonly called power or authority.    3. That thus the Scripture also styles church government, viz. power or  authority, as 2 Cor. x. 8, \"Of our authority\" (or power) \"which the Lord  hath given us for your edification.\" Paul speaks it of this power of  church government. And again, speaking of the same subject, he saith,  \"Lest being present, I should use sharpness, according to the power  which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.\" 2  Cor. xiii. 10.    For further clearing hereof, consider the several sorts or kinds of  ecclesiastical power, according to this type or scheme of ecclesiastical  power and authority here subjoined.    Ecclesiastical power is either supreme and magisterial; or subordinate  and ministerial.    I. Supreme magisterial power, consisting in a lordly dominion and  sovereignty over the Church; and may come under a double consideration,  viz:    1. As it is justly attributed to God alone. Thus the absolute  sovereignty and supreme power (to speak properly) is only his over the  Church, and all creatures in the whole universe: now this supreme divine  power is either essential or mediatorial.    1. Essential, viz. that power which belongs to the essence of God, and  to every person of the Trinity in common, as God. \"His kingdom ruleth  over all,\" Psal. ciii. 19. \"God ruleth in Jacob to the ends of the  earth,\" Psal. lix. 13. \"The kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the  Governor among the nations,\" Psal. xxii. 28.    2. Mediatorial, viz. that magisterial, lordly, and sovereign power or  dominion, which God hath dispensed, delegated, or committed to Christ as  Mediator, being both head of the Church, and over all things to the  Church. This power is peculiar only to Jesus Christ our Mediator. \"All  power is given to me both in heaven and in earth,\" Matt. xxviii. 18.  \"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand,\"  John iii. 35. \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all  judgment to the Son,\" John v. 22. \"One is your Master, even Christ,\"  Matt. xxiii. 8, 10. \"God hath put all things under his feet, and gave  him to be head over all things to the Church,\" Eph. i. 20-23.--This  power of Christ is the only proper fountain whence all ecclesiastical  power flows to the Church.    II. As it is unjustly arrogated and usurped by man; whether, 1. By the  pope to himself; who arrogates to himself to be Christ's vicar, the  supreme visible head on earth of the visible catholic Church of Christ;  who exalts himself above all that is called God on earth, over  magistrates, princes, kings, yea, over the souls and consciences of  men, and the holy Scriptures of God themselves, &c., 2 Thess. ii. 4;  Rev. xviii. 10-13.    2. By earthly princes to themselves: as, King Henry VIII., who, casting  off the papal power and primacy, was vested with it himself within his  own dominions, over the Church, accounting himself the fountain of all  ecclesiastical power, (it being by statute law annexed to the crown,)  and assuming to himself that papal title of supreme head of the Church,  &c., which is sharply taxed by orthodox divines of foreign churches.  Thus, that most learned Rivet, taxing Bishop Gardiner for extolling the  king's primacy, saith, \"For, he that did as yet nourish the doctrine of  the papacy, as after it appeared, did erect a new papacy in the person  of the king.\"--Andrew Rivet, _Expli. Decalog. Edit._ ii. page 203.  Judicious Calvin saith thus: \"And to this day how many are there in the  papacy that heap upon kings whatsoever right and power they can  possibly, so that there may not be any dispute of religion; but should  this power be in one king, to decree according to his own pleasure  whatsoever he pleaseth, and that should remain fixed without  controversy? They that at first so much extolled Henry, king of England,  (certainly they were inconsiderate men,) gave unto him supreme power of  all things, and this grievously wounded me always; for they were  blasphemers, when they called him the supreme head of the Church under  Christ: certainly this was too much. But let this remain buried, because  they sinned by an inconsiderate zeal. But when that impostor, (he means  Bishop Gardiner, as Rivet notes,) which after was chancellor of this  Proserpina, which there at this day overcometh all the devils, he when  he was at Ratisbon did not contend with reasons, (I speak of this last  chancellor, who was Bishop of Winchester,) but as I now began to say, he  much regarded not scripture testimonies; but said, it was at the  pleasure of the king to abrogate the statutes, and institute new rites.  Touching fasting, there the king can enjoin and command the people, that  this or that day the people may eat flesh: yea, that it is lawful for  the king to forbid priests to marry; yea, that it is lawful for the king  to forbid to the people the use of the cup in the Lord's supper; that it  is lawful for the king to decree this or that in his kingdom. Why?  Because the king hath the supreme power. It is certain, if kings do  their duty, they are both patrons of religion, and nurse-fathers of the  Church, as Isaiah calls them, Isa. xlix. 23. This, therefore, is  principally required of kings, that they use the sword wherewith they  are furnished, for the maintaining of God's worship. But in the mean  time there are inconsiderate men, that make them too spiritual; and this  fault reigns up and down Germany; yea, spreads too much in  these countries. And now we perceive what fruits spring from this root,  viz: that princes, and all that are in place of government, think  themselves to be so spiritual, that there is no other ecclesiastical  government. And this sacrilege creeps among us, because they cannot  measure their office with certain and lawful bounds, but are of opinion  they cannot reign, unless they abolish all the authority of the Church,  and become the chief judges both in doctrine, and in the whole spiritual  government. At the beginning they pretend some zeal; but mere ambition  drives them, that so solicitously they snatch all things to themselves.  Therefore there ought to be a temper kept; for this disease hath always  reigned in princes, to desire to bend religion according to their own  pleasure and lust, and for their own profits in the mean time. For they  have respect to their profit, because for the most part they are not  acted by the Spirit of God, but their ambition carries them.\" Thus  Calvin in Amos vii. 13. Oh what exclamations would this holy man have  poured out, had he lived to see the passages of our days! _Quis talia  fando temperet a lachrymis!_[25]    II. Subordinate ministerial power, which is either,    1. Indirectly, improperly, and only objectively ecclesiastical or  spiritual, (so called, because it is exercised about spiritual or  ecclesiastical objects, though formally in its own nature it be properly  a mere civil or political power.) This is that power which is allowed to  the civil magistrate about religion; he is _an overseer of things  without the Church_, having an external care of religion as a  _nurse-father_, Isa. xlix. 23; as had Hezekiah, Josiah, Asa,  Jehoshaphat, &c.; so as, by the law, to restore religion decayed, reform  the Church corrupted, protect the Church reformed, &c.    2. Directly, properly, and formally ecclesiastical or spiritual, having  respect properly to matters within the Church. This power only belongs  to church officers, who are overseers of things within, 1 Cor. iv. 20,  21; 2 Cor. x. 8, and xiii. 10; and this is either, 1. More special and  peculiar to the office of some church governors only, as the power of  preaching the gospel, dispensing the sacraments, &c., which is only  committed to the ministers of the gospel, and which they, as ministers,  may execute, in virtue of their office. This is called by some the key  of doctrine, or key of knowledge; by others, the power of order, or of  special office. See Matt, xxviii. 18-20; Rom. x. 15; 1 Tim. v. 17. 2.  More general and common to the office of all church governors, as the  power of censures, &c., wherein ruling elders act with ministers,  admonishing the unruly, excommunicating the incorrigible, remitting and  receiving again of the penitent into church communion. Compare Matt,  xviii. 17, 18; 1 Cor. v. 2, 4, 5, 7, 11-13; 2 Cor. ii. 6-12, with Rom.  xii. 8; 1 Cor. xii. 28; and 1 Tim. v. 17. This is called the key of  discipline, or power of jurisdiction."]]]
