Dr. Frazer (3) says of the Aztecs,  that \"twice a year, in May and December, an image of the great god  Huitzilopochtli was made of dough, then broken in pieces and solemnly  eaten by his worshipers.\" And Lord Kingsborough in his Mexican  Antiquities (vol. vi, p. 220) gives a record of a \"most Holy Supper\"  in which these people ate the flesh of their god. It was a cake made of  certain seeds, \"and having made it, they blessed it in their manner, and  broke it into pieces, which the high priest put into certain very clean  vessels, and took a thorn of maguey which resembles a very thick needle,  with which he took up with the utmost reverence single morsels, which  he put into the mouth of each individual in the manner of a communion.\"  Acostas (4) confirms this and similar accounts. The Peruvians partook of  a sacrament consisting of a pudding of coarsely ground maize, of which  a portion had been smeared on the idol. The priest sprinkled it with the  blood of the victim before distributing it to the people. Priest and  people then all took their shares in turn, \"with great care that no  particle should be allowed to fall to the ground--this being looked upon  as a great sin.\" (5)       (1) See Doane's Bible Myths, p. 306.

Moving from Peru to China (instead of 'from China to Peru') we find that  \"the Chinese pour wine (a very general substitute for blood) on a straw  image of Confucius, and then all present drink of it, and taste the  sacrificial victim, in order to participate in the grace of Confucius.\"  (Here again the Corn and Wine are blended in one rite.) And of Tartary  Father Grueber thus testifies: \"This only I do affirm, that the devil so  mimics the Catholic Church there, that although no European or Christian  has ever been there, still in all essential things they agree so  completely with the Roman Church, as even to celebrate the Host with  bread and wine: with my own eyes I have seen it.\" (1) These few  instances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion of  Totem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world.     (1) For these two quotations see Jevons' Introduction to the  History of Religion, pp. 148 and 219.          V. FOOD AND VEGETATION MAGIC    I have wandered, in pursuit of Totems and the Eucharist, some way from  the astronomical thread of Chapters II and III, and now it would appear  that in order to understand religious origins we must wander still  farther. The chapters mentioned were largely occupied with Sungods and  astronomical phenomena, but now we have to consider an earlier period  when there were no definite forms of gods, and when none but the vaguest  astronomical knowledge existed. Sometimes in historical matters it is  best and safest to move thus backwards in Time, from the things recent  and fairly well known to things more ancient and less known. In this way  we approach more securely to some understanding of the dim and remote  past.    It is clear that before any definite speculations on heaven-dwelling  gods or divine beings had arisen in the human mind--or any clear  theories of how the sun and moon and stars might be connected with the  changes of the seasons on the earth--there were still certain obvious  things which appealed to everybody, learned or unlearned alike. One of  these was the return of Vegetation, bringing with it the fruits or the  promise of the fruits of the earth, for human food, and also bringing  with it increase of animal life, for food in another form; and the other  was the return of Light and Warmth, making life easier in all ways. Food  delivering from the fear of starvation; Light and Warmth delivering from  the fear of danger and of cold. These were three glorious things which  returned together and brought salvation and renewed life to man. The  period of their return was 'Spring,' and though Spring and its benefits  might fade away in time, still there was always the HOPE of its  return--though even so it may have been a long time in human evolution  before man discovered that it really did always return, and (with  certain allowances) at equal intervals of time.    Long then before any Sun or Star gods could be called in, the return of  the Vegetation must have enthralled man's attention, and filled him with  hope and joy. Yet since its return was somewhat variable and uncertain  the question, What could man do to assist that return? naturally  became a pressing one. It is now generally held that the use of  Magic--sympathetic magic--arose in this way. Sympathetic magic seems to  have been generated by a belief that your own actions cause a similar  response in things and persons around you. Yet this belief did not rest  on any philosophy or argument, but was purely instinctive and sometimes  of the nature of a mere corporeal reaction. Every schoolboy knows how  in watching a comrade's high jump at the Sports he often finds himself  lifting a knee at the moment 'to help him over'; at football matches  quarrels sometimes arise among the spectators by reason of an  ill-placed kick coming from a too enthusiastic on-looker, behind one;  undergraduates running on the tow-path beside their College boat in  the races will hurry even faster than the boat in order to increase its  speed; there is in each case an automatic bodily response increased  by one's own desire. A person ACTS the part which he desires to be  successful. He thinks to transfer his energy in that way. Again, if by  chance one witnesses a painful accident, a crushed foot or what-not,  it commonly happens that one feels a pain in the same part oneself--a  sympathetic pain. What more natural than to suppose that the pain  really is transferred from the one person to the other? and how easy the  inference that by tormenting a wretched scape-goat or crucifying a human  victim in some cases the sufferings of people may be relieved or their  sins atoned for?    Simaetha, it will be remembered, in the second Idyll of Theocritus,  curses her faithless lover Delphis, and as she melts his waxen image she  prays that HE TOO MAY MELT. All this is of the nature of Magic, and is  independent of and generally more primitive than Theology or Philosophy.  Yet it interests us because it points to a firm instinct in early  man--to which I have already alluded--the instinct of his unity and  continuity with the rest of creation, and of a common life so close  that his lightest actions may cause a far-reaching reaction in the world  outside.    Man, then, independently of any belief in gods, may assist the arrival  of Spring by magic ceremonies. If you want the Vegetation to appear you  must have rain; and the rain-maker in almost all primitive tribes has  been a MOST important personage. Generally he based his rites on quite  fanciful associations, as when the rain-maker among the Mandans wore a  raven's skin on his head (bird of the storm) or painted his shield with  red zigzags of lightning (1); but partly, no doubt, he had observed  actual facts, or had had the knowledge of them transmitted to him--as,  for instance that when rain is impending loud noises will bring about  its speedy downfall, a fact we moderns have had occasion to notice on  battlefields. He had observed perhaps that in a storm a specially loud  clap of thunder is generally followed by a greatly increased downpour  of rain. He had even noticed (a thing which I have often verified in  the vicinity of Sheffield) that the copious smoke of fires will generate  rain-clouds--and so quite naturally he concluded that it was his smoking  SACRIFICES which had that desirable effect. So far he was on the track  of elementary Science. And so he made \"bull-roarers\" to imitate the  sound of wind and the blessed rain-bringing thunder, or clashed  great bronze cymbals together with the same object. Bull-voices and  thunder-drums and the clashing of cymbals were used in this connection  by the Greeks, and are mentioned by Aeschylus (2); but the bull-roarer,  in the form of a rhombus of wood whirled at the end of a string, seems  to be known, or to have been known, all over the world. It is described  with some care by Mr. Andrew Lang in his Custom and Myth (pp. 29-44),  where he says \"it is found always as a sacred instrument employed in  religious mysteries, in New Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, ancient  Greece, and Africa.\"     (1) See Catlin's North American Indians, Letter 19.     (2) Themis, p. 61.      Sometimes, of course, the rain-maker was successful; but of the inner  causes of rain he knew next to nothing; he was more ignorant even than  we are! His main idea was a more specially 'magical' one--namely, that  the sound itself would appeal to the SPIRITS of rain and thunder and  cause them to give a response. For of course the thunder (in Hebrew  Bath-Kol, \"the daughter of the Voice\") was everywhere regarded as  the manifestation of a spirit. (1) To make sounds like thunder would  therefore naturally call the attention of such a spirit; or he, the  rain-maker, might make sounds like rain.

Within 200,000,000 or 300,000,000 miles from the  sun, the one hundred and ninety-two minute bodies that have been  already discovered move in paths very nearly the same--indeed two of  them traverse the same orbit, being one hundred and eighty degrees  apart;--they look alike, yet the eye of man in a few observations  so determines the curve of each orbit, that one is never mistaken  for another. But astronomy has higher uses than fixing time,  establishing landmarks, and guiding the sailor. It greatly quickens  and enlarges thought, excites a desire to know, leads to the utmost  exactness, and ministers to adoration and love of the Maker of  the innumerable suns.          [Page 75]  V.    THE SUN.    \"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and  the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.\"--_Gen._  i. 16.    [Page 76]  \"It is perceived that the sun of the world, with all its essence,  which is heat and light, flows into every tree, and into every  shrub and flower, and into every stone, mean as well as precious;  and that every object takes its portion from this common influx,  and that the sun does not divide its light and heat, and dispense  a part to this and a part to that. It is similar with the sun of  heaven, from which the Divine love proceeds as heat, and the Divine  wisdom as light; these two flow into human minds, as the heat and  light of the sun of the world into bodies, and vivify them according  to the quality of the minds, each of which takes from the common  influx as much as is necessary.\"--SWEDENBORG.          [Page 77]  V.    _THE SUN._    Suppose we had stood on the dome of Boston Statehouse November 9th,  1872, on the night of the great conflagration, and seen the fire  break out; seen the engines dash through the streets, tracking their  path by their sparks; seen the fire encompass a whole block, leap  the streets on every side, surge like the billows of a storm-swept  sea; seen great masses of inflammable gas rise like dark clouds  from an explosion, then take fire in the air, and, cut off from  the fire below, float like argosies of flame in space. Suppose we  had felt the wind that came surging from all points of the compass  to fan that conflagration till it was light enough a mile away to  see to read the finest print, hot enough to decompose the torrents  of water that were dashed on it, making new fuel to feed the flame.  Suppose we had seen this spreading fire seize on the whole city,  extend to its environs, and, feeding itself on the very soil, lick  up Worcester with its tongues of flame--Albany, New York, Chicago,  St. Louis, Cincinnati--and crossing the plains swifter than a prairie  fire, making each peak of the Rocky Mountains hold up aloft a separate  torch of flame, and the Sierras whiter with heat than they ever were  with snow, the waters of the Pacific resolve into their constituent  elements of oxygen and hydrogen, and [Page 78] burn with  unquenchable fire! We withdraw into the air, and see below a world  on fire. All the prisoned powers have burst into intensest activity.  Quiet breezes have become furious tempests. Look around this flaming  globe--on fire above, below, around--there is nothing but fire. Let  it roll beneath us till Boston comes round again. No ember has yet  cooled, no spire of flame has shortened, no surging cloud has been  quieted. Not only are the mountains still in flame, but other ranges  burst up out of the seething sea. There is no place of rest, no  place not tossing with raging flame! Yet all this is only a feeble  figure of the great burning sun. It is but the merest hint, a  million times too insignificant.    The sun appears small and quiet to us because we are so far away.  Seen from the various planets, the relative size of the sun appears  as in Fig. 30. Looked for from some of the stars about us, the  sun could not be seen at all. Indeed, seen from the earth, it is  not always the same size, because the distance is not always the  same. If we represent the size of the sun by one thousand on the  23d of September or 21st of March, it would be represented by nine  hundred and sixty-seven on the 1st of July, and by one thousand  and thirty-four on the 1st of January.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Relative Size of Sun as seen from Different  Planets.]    We sometimes speak of the sun as having a diameter of 860,000 miles.  We mean that that is the extent of the body as soon by the eye.  But that is a small part of its real diameter. So we say the earth  has an equatorial diameter of 7925-1/2 miles, and a polar one of  7899. But the air is as much a part of the earth as the rocks are.  The electric currents are as much a part of the [Page 79] earth as  the ores and mountains they traverse. What the diameter of the earth  is, including these, no man can tell. We used to say the air  extended forty-five miles, but we now know that it reaches vastly  farther. So of the sun, we might almost say that its diameter is  infinite, for its light and heat reach beyond our measurement. Its  living, throbbing heart sends out pulsations, keeping all space full  of its tides of living light.    [Page 80]  [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Zodiacal Light.]    We might say with evident truth that the far-off planets are a  part of the sun, since the space they traverse is filled with the  power of that controlling king; not only with light, but also with  gravitating power.    But come to more ponderable matters. If we look [Page 81] into our  western sky soon after sunset, on a clear, moonless night in March  or April, we shall see a dim, soft light, somewhat like the  milky-way, often reaching, well defined, to the Pleiades. It is  wedge-shaped, inclined to the south, and the smallest star can  easily be seen through it. Mairan and Cassini affirm that they have  seen sudden sparkles and movements of light in it. All our best  tests show the spectrum of this light to be continuous, and  therefore reflected; which indicates that it is a ring of small  masses of meteoric matter surrounding the sun, revolving with it and  reflecting its light. One bit of stone as large as the end of one's  thumb, in a cubic mile, would be enough to reflect what light we see  looking through millions of miles of it. Perhaps an eye sufficiently  keen and far away would see the sun surrounded by a luminous disk,  as Saturn is with his rings. As it extends beyond the earth's orbit,  if this be measured as a part of the sun, its diameter would be  about 200,000,000 miles.    Come closer. When the sun is covered by the disk of the moon at  the instant of total eclipse, observers are startled by strange  swaying luminous banners, ghostly and weird, shooting in changeful  play about the central darkness (Fig. 32). These form the corona.  Men have usually been too much moved to describe them, and have  always been incapable of drawing them in the short minute or two  of their continuance. But in 1878 men travelled eight thousand  miles, coming and returning, in order that they might note the  three minutes of total eclipse in Colorado. Each man had his work  assigned to him, and he was drilled to attend to that and nothing  else. Improved instruments were put into his [Page 82] hands, so  that the sun was made to do his own drawing and give his own picture  at consecutive instants. Fig. 33 is a copy of a photograph of the  corona of 1878, by Mr. Henry Draper. It showed much less  changeability that year than common, it being very near the time of  least sun-spot. The previous picture was taken near the time of  maximum sun-spot.    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--The Corona in 1858, Brazil.]    It was then settled that the corona consists of reflected light,  sent to us from dust particles or meteoroids swirling in the vast  seas, giving new densities and [Page 83] rarities, and hence this  changeful light. Whether they are there by constant projection, and  fall again to the sun, or are held by electric influence, or by  force of orbital revolution, we do not know. That the corona cannot  be in any sense an atmosphere of any continuous gas, is seen from  the fact that the comet of 1843, passing within 93,000 miles of the  body of the sun, was not burned out of existence as a comet, nor in  any perceptible degree retarded in its motion. If the sun's diameter  is to include the corona, it will be from 1,260,000 to 1,460,000  miles.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--The Corolla in 1878, Colorado.]   [Page 84] Come closer still. At the instant of the totality of the   eclipse red flames of most fantastic shape play along the edge of   the moon's disk. They can be seen at any time by the use of a   proper telescope with a spectroscope attached. I have seen them   with great distinctness and brilliancy with the excellent   eleven-inch telescope of the Wesleyan University. A description of   their appearance is best given in the language of Professor Young,   of Princeton College, who has made these flames the object of most   successful study. On September 7th, 1871, he was observing a large   hydrogen cloud by the sun's edge. This cloud was about 100,000   miles long, and its upper side was some 50,000 miles above the   sun's surface, the lower side some 15,000 miles. The whole had the   appearance of being supported on pillars of fire, these seeming   pillars being in reality hydrogen jets brighter and more active   than the substance of the cloud. At half-past twelve, when   Professor Young chanced to be called away from his observatory,   there were no indications of any approaching change, except that   one of the connecting stems of the southern extremity of the cloud   had grown considerably brighter and more curiously bent to one   side; and near the base of another, at the northern end, a little   brilliant lump had developed itself, shaped much like a summer   thunderhead.
