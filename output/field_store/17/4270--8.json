For here, for six long years, the world-renowned,    The tender lover of all living things,    Fasted and watched and wrestled for the light,    Less for himself than for a weeping world.    And here arrived, he ate his simple meal,    And then in silent meditation sat    The livelong day, heedless of noon's fierce heat    That sent to covert birds and panting beasts,    And from the parched and glowing plain sent up,    As from a furnace, gusts of scorching air,    Through which the city's walls, the rocks and trees.    All seemed to tremble, quiver, glow and shake,    As if a palsy shook the trembling world;    Heedless of loosened rocks that crashed so near,    And dashed and thundered to the depths below,    And of the shepherds, who with wondering awe    Came near to gaze upon his noble form    And gentle, loving but majestic face,    And thought some god had deigned to visit men.    And thus he sat, still as the rock his seat,    Seeking to pierce the void from whence man came,    To look beyond the veil that shuts him in,    To find a clue to life's dark labyrinth,    Seeking to know why man is cast adrift    Upon the bosom of a troubled sea,    His boat so frail, his helm and compass lost,    To sink at last in dull oblivion's depths;    When nature seems so perfect and complete,    Grand as a whole, and perfect all its parts,    Which from the greatest to the least proclaims    That Wisdom, Watchfulness, and Power and Love    Which built the mountains, spread the earth abroad,    And fixed the bounds that ocean cannot pass;    Which taught the seasons their accustomed rounds,    Lest seed-time and the happy harvests fail;    Which guides the stars in their celestial course,    And guides the pigeon's swift unerring flight    O'er mountain, sea and plain and desert waste,    Straight as an arrow to her distant home;    Teaching the ant for winter to prepare;    Clothing the lily in its princely pride;    Watching the tiny sparrow when it falls;    Nothing too great for His almighty arm;    Nothing too small for His all-seeing eye;    Nothing too mean for His paternal care.      And thus he mused, seeking to find a light    To guide men on their dark and weary way,    And through the valley and the shades of death,    Until the glories of the setting sun    Called him to vespers and his evening meal.      Then roused from revery, ablutions made,    Eight times he bowed, just as the setting sun,    A fiery red, sunk slowly out of sight    Beyond the western plains, gilded and tinged,    Misty and vast, beneath a brilliant sky,    Shaded from brightest gold to softest rose.    Then, after supper, back and forth he paced    Upon the narrow rock before his cave,    Seeking to ease his numbed and stiffened limbs;    While evening's sombre shadows slowly crept    From plain to hill and highest mountain-top,    And solemn silence settled on the world,    Save for the night-jar's cry and owl's complaint;    While many lights from out the city gleam,    And thickening stars spangle the azure vault,    Until the moon, with soft and silvery light,    Half veils and half reveals the sleeping world.    And then he slept--for weary souls must sleep,    As well as bodies worn with daily toil;    And as he lay stretched on his hard, cold bed,    His youthful blood again bounds freely on,    Repairing wastes the weary day had made.    And then he dreamed.  Sometimes he dreamed of home,    Of young Rahula, reaching out his arms,    Of sweet Yasodhara with loving words    Cheering him on, as love alone can cheer.    Sometimes he dreamed he saw that living light    For which his earnest soul so long had yearned--    But over hills and mountains far away.    And then he seemed with labored steps to climb    Down giddy cliffs, far harder than ascent,    While yawning chasms threatened to devour,    And beetling cliffs precluded all retreat;    But still the way seemed opening step by step,    Until he reached the valley's lowest depths,    Where twilight reigned, and grim and ghastly forms,    With flaming swords, obstruct his onward way,    But his all-conquering love still urged him on,    When with wild shrieks they vanished in thin air;    And then he climbed, clinging to jutting cliffs,    And stunted trees that from each crevice grew,    Till weary, breathless, he regained the heights,    To see that light nearer, but still so far.      And thus he slept, and thus sometimes he dreamed,    But rose before the dawn had tinged the east,    Before the jungle-cock had made his call,    When thoughts are clearest, and the world is still,    Refreshed and strengthened for his daily search    Into the seeds of sorrow, germs of pain,    After a light to scatter doubts and fears.      But when the coming day silvered the east,    And warmed that silver into softest gold,    And faintest rose-tints tinged the passing clouds,    He, as the Vedas taught, each morning bathed    In the clear stream that murmured near his cave,    Then bowed in reverence to the rising sun,    As from behind the glittering mountain-peaks    It burst in glory on the waking world.      Then bowl and staff in hand, he took his way    Along his mountain-path and through the grove,    And through the gardens, through the fruitful fields,    Down to the city, for his daily alms;    While children his expected coming watch,    And running cry: \"The gracious Rishi comes.\"    All gladly gave, and soon his bowl was filled,    For he repaid their gifts with gracious thanks,    And his unbounded love, clearer than words,    Spoke to their hearts as he passed gently on.    Even stolid plowmen after him would look,    Wondering that one so stately and so grand    Should even for them have kind and gracious words,    Sometimes while passing through the sacred grove,    He paused beneath an aged banyan-tree,    Whose spreading branches drooping down took root    To grow again in other giant trunks,    An ever-widening, ever-deepening shade,    Where five, like him in manhood's early prime,    Each bound to life by all its tender ties,    High born and rich, had left their happy homes,    Their only food chance-gathered day by day,    Their only roof this spreading banyan-tree;    And there long time they earnestly communed,    Seeking to aid each other in the search    For higher life and for a clearer light.    And here, under a sacred peepul's shade,    Two Brahmans, famed for sanctity, had dwelt    For many years, all cares of life cast off,    Who by long fastings sought to make the veil    Of flesh translucent to the inner eye;    Eyes fixed intently on the nose's tip,    To lose all consciousness of outward things;    By breath suppressed to still the outer pulse,    So that the soul might wake to conscious life,    And on unfolded wings unchecked might rise.    And in the purest auras freely soar,    Above cross-currents that engender clouds    Where thunders roll, and quick cross-lightnings play,    To view the world of causes and of life,    And bathe in light that knows no night, no change.    With eager questionings he sought to learn,    While they with gentle answers gladly taught    All that their self-denying search had learned.    And thus he passed his days and months and years,    In constant, patient, earnest search for light,    With longer fastings and more earnest search,    While day by day his body frailer grew,    Until his soul, loosed from its earthly bonds,    Sometimes escaped its narrow prison-house,    And like the lark to heaven's gate it soared,    To view the glories of the coming dawn.    But as he rose, the sad and sorrowing world,    For which his soul with tender love had yearned,    Seemed deeper in the nether darkness sunk,    Beyond his reach, beyond his power to save,    When sadly to his prison-house he turned,    Wishing no light that did not shine for all.      Six years had passed, six long and weary years,    Since first he left the world to seek for light.    Knowledge he found, knowledge that soared aloft    To giddy heights, and sounded hidden depths,    Secrets of knowledge that the Brahmans taught    The favored few, but far beyond the reach    Of those who toil and weep and cry for help;    A light that gilds the highest mountain-tops,    But leaves the fields and valleys dark and cold;    But not that living light for which he yearned,    To light life's humble walks and common ways,    And send its warmth to every heart and home,    As spring-time sends a warm and genial glow    To every hill and valley, grove and field,    Clothing in softest verdure common grass,    As well as sandal-trees and lofty palms.      One night, when hope seemed yielding to despair,    Sleepless he lay upon the earth--his bed--    When suddenly a white and dazzling light    Shone through the cave, and all was dark again.    Startled he rose, then prostrate in the dust,    His inmost soul breathed forth an earnest prayer[1]    That he who made the light would make it shine    Clearer and clearer to that perfect day,    When innocence, and peace, and righteousness    Might fill the earth, and ignorance and fear,    And cruelty and crime, might fly away,    As birds of night and savage prowling beasts    Fly from the glories of the rising sun.    Long time he lay, wrestling in earnest prayer,    When from the eastern wall, one clothed in light,    Beaming with love, and halo-crowned, appeared,    And gently said: \"Siddartha, rise! go forth!    Waste not your days in fasts, your nights in tears!    Give what you have; do what you find to do;    With gentle admonitions check the strong;    With loving counsels aid and guide the weak,    And light will come, the day will surely dawn.\"    This said, the light grew dim, the form was gone,    But hope revived, his heart was strong again.      Joyful he rose, and when the rising sun    Had filled the earth's dark places full of light,    With all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#12)"],[1,"who can count  a few girls amongst her party. I may as well add here that girls are  almost \"non est\" in the camp, many districts for leagues and leagues  round not being able to boast of one English girl.    [Illustration: _Tennis Party at Vera_.]    Most clubs hold a Gymkhana Meeting in the Autumn, which makes one more  excitement in the year: it is a very merry meeting as a rule, with  always a dance or two if enough girls can be found. During the Winter  season (from April 1st to September 1st) the shooting is very good in  most parts, and many good shooting parties are given where there is  enough game to make it worth while asking one's friends. The bag  consists of partridges, martinetta (similar to the pheasant) and hares  (which are not considered worth picking up); when there are a number of  guns, dogs are not used, but two men on horseback drag a wire through  the grass (several in a line, if a big party), which forces the birds to  rise, and the guns walk behind. Peons on horseback, carrying sacks, keep  close up to them and pick up the birds as they fall, and close on their  heels comes a big brake, into which are emptied the contents of the  sacks as they get too heavy. The ladies of the party follow in all sorts  and conditions of vehicles, cheering on the shooters and dispensing  much-needed refreshments. A shoot is always followed up by a jolly  evening, after a hot bath and a good dinner. The men, forgetting how  tired they are, are quite ready to sing, dance, or play bridge until the  small hours. Another great event not to be forgotten is the visit of the  Camp Chaplain: he goes from one district to another holding services,  every Sunday in a different place. In a well-populated district he would  hold one about every two months, but to some places, where there are  next to no English people, he would probably only go about once or twice  a year. Church Sunday is quite an event, and again gives one an  opportunity of meeting friends from a distance. The parson is very  lenient with us as a rule, and does not object to any form of amusement  in the afternoon, such as polo, tennis, cricket, football, or golf, and  encourages the young men to come to _Church_ (usually a room hired for  the occasion) in costumes suitable for such. Our poor Camp Chaplain does  not have an easy time; distances are so great that more than half his  time is spent on the train.    [Illustration: _Carnival at Vera_.]          CARNIVAL IN THE ARGENTINE.      Carnival falls every year during the week before the beginning of Lent.  It is a general holiday, and much fun and amusement are crammed into the  few days which precede the dull season of fasting.    Carnival is more observed in camp towns than in the bigger cities, where  the custom of celebrating it is very much on the wane, and where the law  forbids water-throwing and other such damp forms of amusement, which are  winked at by the more lenient authorities in local towns.    It is really quite a pretty sight to see a camp town during carnival.  The one main street, which does not boast of pavements, and is generally  a yard deep in dust, is gaily decorated with bunting and festoons. Small  stands are put up every ten yards or so, in which the \"caballeros\" take  up their positions and pelt the \"senoritas\" with confetti and  \"serpentinas\" (blocks of different coloured paper which look like rolls  of tape about 30 or 50 yards long). The elite of the \"pueblo\" drive  round in the procession; ladies, some in the very latest creations, and  some in beautiful fancy dresses, parade round in flower and ribbon  bedecked carriages. A prize is generally given to the best decorated  conveyance, and to the best fancy costume, which causes a lot of  competition and jealousy amongst the fair sex.    On an estancia, carnival is celebrated in a much more drastic fashion.  On one place, the giddy members of the household have a very rowdy time  of it, and make things very lively for the unwary. On one occasion, they  determined to give the mayor-domo his share of the general drenching  which he had missed; so when he rode in at midday, after a long and busy  morning's work in the camp, he was welcomed with a volley of buckets of  water, which were emptied over him from the top of the house, where the  delinquents had taken up their advantageous position.    Another time a certain young damsel, a guest in the same house, saw from  the window her hostess entertaining one of the boys, a fresh arrival  from England, who had ridden over from a neighbouring estancia. Prompted  by her daring friends she was induced to take up a jug of water, and  stealing up behind his chair, emptied the contents of the vessel over  the visitor's head, and then bolted; the injured party, after recovering  his self-possession, rose to the occasion and gave chase, and after a  desperate struggle, and in spite of penitent apologies, she was borne  off by her captor and deposited in the first tub he happened to see,  which turned out to be a freshly painted rubbish barrel.    There is not much respecting of persons on these occasions, the girls  generally combine against the boys, who, as a rule, come off best. The  most binding promises are made on both sides, who vow not to throw  anything larger than a \"globo\" (a small balloon filled with water, which  bursts when it touches anything solid) or \"poms\" (leaden squirt full of  scent); but in the excitement of the fray which follows all is  forgotten, and buckets of water, the garden hose, and even the ducking  of some in water troughs, are the final outcome.    The scene after an afternoon or evening's battle is very funny; girls,  with their hair lying in dripping masses over their faces and shoulders,  their dresses, generally the oldest of thin cotton ones, clinging  hopelessly to their wearied forms, present a truly comic sight. When  they are all tired of strife, they retire by common consent to the  house, where, after discarding their soaking garments and taking a warm  bath, they are ready to discuss the glories of the day over a  much-wanted dinner.          HORSE-RACING IN THE ARGENTINE.          HORSE-RACING IN THE ARGENTINE.      In this country a great deal more racing goes on than in Europe, and it  is not confined to the moneyed classes only. Even the \"peones\" hold  their small meetings and match their grass-fed ponies. Estancieros and  mayor-domos have camp race-meetings once or twice yearly at all the  larger polo clubs, and at Palermo and Hurlingham every class of society  in Buenos Aires may be seen on the stands.    At Palmero race-meetings are held frequently, almost weekly in fact, on  Sunday afternoons; and the stands are generally well filled. On days of  festival, when there is a special programme, the place is crowded, and  these occasions correspond, more or less, with the more important  meetings in England.    The course is of earth, and perfectly flat, so that the only thing which  interferes with the view is dust. The stands are magnificent and the  different grades of society are divided by railings, while at the back  of each may be seen the row of offices of the \"Sport,\" which is the  betting system of the country.    This consists of tickets, which are sold at a fixed price, with the name  of one of the entries. After the race there is a great rush to the  offices, made by those who have bought the winner, to collect their  winnings, which are the total receipts, minus a small percentage,  divided by the number of those who bought the winner. In this way a very  hot favourite will pay very little more than the original purchase  money, while an outsider who wins will pay his backers perhaps ten, or  even twenty times their deposit. There is also private betting, of  course, but no public bookmakers.    The horses are of very good quality, though not up to the standard of  the classic races in Europe. A number of youngsters are imported yearly  from England and the United States, and among them usually some good  selling-plate winners, and one or two that have been placed in  first-class flat races. The country also produces some excellent horses,  and they are improving every year; the stud farms are already well known  in Europe as some of the best in the world. Of these, the most  important, perhaps, is the \"Ojo de Agua,\" so-called from its famous  spring, which waters all the stables as well as dwelling quarters. It is  the home of the famous Cyllene, whose offspring we expect to see winning  races in the near future; Polar Star, scarcely less known, and  Ituzaingo, a native of this country, are his present companions; while  the remains of Gay Hermit, Stiletto, Pietermaritzburg, and Kendal, all  of whom are well known among turf circles at home, rest beneath its  soil. There are several other equally famous stud farms, such as the  \"San Jacinto,\" the present home of Val d'Or, who won the Eclipse Stakes  from Cicero, the Derby winner of that year; at another, Diamond Jubilee,  whose list of victories is long, resided for the latter part of his  life.    Nor are the jockeys unworthy of their mounts, and some very fine riding  may be witnessed both at Palermo and Hurlingham.    In contrast to these races, run on a well-ordered course, and watched  from luxurious stands, are the native \"cancha\" meetings, held, probably,  at some country public-house, and run on a \"cancha,\" consisting of a  soft piece of road, or along a fence where there are no holes. The races  consist of matches arranged between two ponies, over short distances.  The start is made only by agreement of both the jockeys, and thus many  hours are wasted in their manoeuvres to get the advantage of one another  at the start. If the judges have money on the loser, the race is often  given a dead heat, and has to be run again. The pony of most endurance  has usually the best chance of winning, though the race itself is short,  as his rival may be tired"]]]
