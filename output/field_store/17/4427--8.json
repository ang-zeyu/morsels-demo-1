If you do not abandon this evil  purpose, then our intercourse must end. More than that, I shall become  your enemy.\"    \"You are my only friend,\" said Debendra; \"I would lose half of what I  possess rather than lose you. Still, I confess I would rather lose you  than give up the hope of seeing Kunda Nandini.\"    \"Then it must be so. I can no longer associate with you.\"    Thus saying, Surendra departed with a sorrowful heart.    Debendra, greatly afflicted at losing his one friend, sat some time in  repentant thought. At length he said: \"Let it go! in this world who  cares for any one? Each for himself!\"    Then filling his glass he drank, and under the influence of the  liquor his heart quickly became joyous. Closing his eyes, he began to  sing some doggerel beginning--        \"My name is Hira, the flower girl.\"    Presently a voice answered from without--        \"My name is Hira Malini.    He is talking in his cups; I can't bear to see it.\"    Debendra, hearing the voice, called out noisily, \"Who are you--a male  or female spirit?\"    Then, jingling her bangles, the spirit entered and sat down by  Debendra. The spirit was covered with a _sari_, bracelets on her arms,  on her neck a charm, ornaments in her ears, silver chain round her  waist, on her ankles rings. She was scented with attar.    Debendra held a light near to the face of the spirit. He did not know  her.    Gently he said, \"Who are you? and from whence do you come?\" Then  holding the light in another direction, he asked, \"Whose spirit are  you?\" At last, finding he could not steady himself, he said, \"Go for  to-day; I will worship you with cakes and flesh of goat on the night  of the dark moon.\"[10]    [Footnote 10: At the time of the dark moon the Hindus worship Kalee and  her attendant spirits.]    Then the spirit, laughing, said, \"Are you well, _Boisnavi Didi_?\"    \"Good heavens!\" said the tipsy one, \"are you a spirit from the Datta  family?\" Thus saying, he again held the lamp near her face; moving it  hither and thither all round, he gravely examined the woman. At last,  throwing down the lamp, he began to sing, \"Who are you? Surely I know  you. Where have I seen you?\"    The woman replied, \"I am Hira.\"    \"Hurrah! Three cheers for Hira!\" Exclaiming thus, the drunken man  began to jump about. Then, falling flat on the floor, he saluted Hira,  and with glass in hand began to sing in her praise.    Hira had discovered during the day that Haridasi _Boisnavi_ and  Debendra Babu were one and the same person. But with what design  Debendra had entered the house of the Dattas it was not so easy to  discover. To find this out, Hira had come to Debendra's house; only  Hira would have had courage for such a deed. She now said:    \"What is my purpose? To day a thief entered the Datta's house and  committed a robbery--I have come to seize the robber.\"    Hearing this, the Babu said: \"It is true I went to steal; but, Hira, I  went not to steal jewels or pearls, but to seek flowers and fruits.\"    \"What flower? Kunda?\"    \"Hurrah! Yes, Kunda. Three cheers for Kunda Nandini! I adore her.\"    \"I have come from Kunda Nandini.\"    \"Hurrah! Speak! speak! What has she sent you to say? Yes, I remember;  why should it not be? For three years we have loved each other.\"    Hira was astonished, but wishing to hear more, she said: \"I did not  know you had loved so long. How did you first make love to her?\"    \"There is no difficulty in that. From my friendship with Tara Charan,  I asked him to introduce me to his wife. He did so, and from that time  I have loved her.\"    \"After that what happened?\" asked Hira.    \"After that, because of your mistress's anger, I did not see Kunda for  many days. Then I entered the house as a _Boisnavi_. The girl is very  timid, she will not speak; but the way in which I coaxed her to-day is  sure to take effect. Why should it not succeed? Am I not Debendra?  Learn well, oh lover! the art of winning hearts!\"    Then Hira said: \"It has become very late; now good-bye,\" and smiling  gently she arose and departed.    Debendra fell into a drunken sleep.    Early the next morning Hira related to Surja Mukhi all that she had  heard from Debendra--his three years' passion, and his present attempt  to play the lover to Kunda Nandini in the disguise of a _Boisnavi_.    Then Surja Mukhi's blue eyes grew inflamed with anger, the crimson  veins on her temples stood out. Kamal also heard it all.    Surja Mukhi sent for Kunda Nandini, and when she came said to her--    \"Kunda, we have learned who Haridasi _Boisnavi_ is. We know that he  is your paramour. I now know your true character. We give no place in  our house to such a woman. Take yourself away from here, otherwise  Hira shall drive you away with a broom.\"    Kunda trembled. Kamal saw that she was about to fall, and led her away  to her own chamber. Remaining there, she comforted Kunda as well as  she could, saying, \"Let the _Bou_ (wife) say what she will, I do not  believe a word of it.\"          CHAPTER XV.    THE FORLORN ONE.      In the depth of night, when all were sleeping, Kunda Nandini opened  the door of her chamber and went forth. With but one dress, the  seventeen-year-old girl left the house of Surja Mukhi, and leaped  alone into the ocean of the world. Kunda had never set foot outside  the house; she could not tell in which direction to go.    The dark body of the large house loomed against the sky. Kunda  wandered for some time in the dark; then she remembered that a light  was usually to be seen from Nagendra's room. She knew how to reach  the spot; and thinking that she would refresh her eyes by seeking that  light, she went to that side of the house. The shutters were open, the  sash closed. In the darkness three lights gleamed; insects were  hovering near trying to reach the light, but the glass repelled them.  Kunda in her heart sympathized with these insects. Her infatuated eyes  dwelt upon the light; she could not bring herself to leave it. She sat  beneath some casuarina-trees near the window, every now and then  watching the fireflies dancing in the trees. In the sky black clouds  chased each other, only a star or two being visible at intervals. All  round the house rows of casuarina-trees raising their heads into the  clouds, stood like apparitions of the night. At the touch of the wind  these giant-faced apparitions whispered in their ghost language over  Kunda Nandini's head. The very ghosts, in their fear of the terrible  night, spoke in low voices. Occasionally the open shutters of the  window flapped against the walls. Black owls hooted as they sat upon  the house; sometimes a dog seeing another animal rushed after it;  sometimes a twig or a fruit fell to the ground. In the distance the  cocoanut palms waved their heads, the rustling of the leaves of the  fan palm reached the ear. Over all the light streamed, and the insect  troop came and went. Kunda sat there gazing.    A sash is gently opened; the figure of a man appears against the  light. Alas! it is Nagendra's figure. Nagendra, what if you should  discover the flower, Kunda, under the trees? What if, seeing you in  the window, the sound of her beating heart should make itself heard?  What if, hearing this sound, she should know that if you move and  become invisible her happiness will be gone? Nagendra, you are  standing out of the light; move it so that she can see you. Kunda is  very wretched; stand there that the clear water of the pool with the  stars reflected in it may not recur to her mind. Listen! the black owl  hoots! Should you move, Kunda will be terrified by the lightning. See  there! the black clouds, pressed by the wind, meet as though in  battle. There will be a rainstorm: who will shelter Kunda? See there!  you have opened the sash, swarms of insects are rushing into your  room. Kunda thinks, \"If I am virtuous, shall I be born again as an  insect?\" Kunda thinks she would like to share the fate of the insects.  \"I have scorched myself, why do I not die?\"    Nagendra, shutting the sash, moves away. Cruel! what harm you have done.  You have no business waking in the night; go to sleep. Kunda Nandini is  dying; let her die!--she would gladly do so to save you a headache. Now  the lightened window has become dark. Looking--looking--wiping her eyes,  Kunda Nandini arose and took the path before her. The ghost-like shrubs,  murmuring, asked, \"Whither goest thou?\" the fan palms rustled, \"Whither  dost thou go?\" the owl's deep voice asked the same question. The window  said, \"Let her go--no more will I show to her _Nagendra_.\" Then foolish  Kunda Nandini gazed once more in that direction.    Oh, iron-hearted Surja Mukhi, arise! think what you have done. Make  the forlorn one return.    Kunda went on, on, on; again the clouds clashed, the sky became as  night, the lightning flashed, the wind moaned, the clouds thundered.  Kunda! Kunda! whither goest thou? The storm came--first the sound,  then clouds of dust, then leaves torn from the trees borne by the  wind; at last, plash, plash, the rain. Kunda, with thy one garment,  whither goest thou?    By the flashes of lightning Kunda saw a hut: its walls were of mud,  supporting a low roof. She sat down within the doorway, resting  against the door. In doing this she made some noise. The house owner  being awake heard the noise, but thought it was made by the storm; but  a dog, who slept within near the door, barking loudly, alarmed the  householder, who timidly opened the door, and seeing only a desolate  woman, asked, \"Who is there?\" No reply. \"Who are you, woman?\"    Kunda said, \"I am standing here because of the storm.\"    \"What? What? Speak again.\"    Kunda repeated her words.    The householder recognizing the voice, drew Kunda indoors, and, making  a fire, discovered herself to be Hira. She comforted Kunda, saying,  \"I understand--you have run away from the scolding; have no fear, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#12)"],[1,"inscription, \"In nomine Domini: di me  Giuseppe Haydn, maia 1791, in London;\" and on the last page, \"Fine, Laus  Deo, 238.\"    That genius may sometimes be trusted to judge of its own work may be  gathered from Haydn's own estimate of these great symphonies.    \"Sir,\" said the well-satisfied Salomon, after a successful performance  of one of them, \"I am strongly of opinion that you will never surpass  these symphonies.\"    \"No!\" replied Haydn; \"I never mean to try.\"    The public, as we have said, was enthusiastic; but such a full banquet  of severe orchestral music was a severe trial to many, and not a few  heads would keep time to the music by steady nods during the slow  movements. Haydn, therefore, composed what is known as the \"Surprise\"  symphony. The slow movement is of the most lulling and soothing  character, and about the time the audience should be falling into its  first snooze, the instruments having all died away into the softest  _pianissimo_, the full orchestra breaks out with a frightful BANG. It is  a question whether the most vigorous performance of this symphony would  startle an audience nowadays, accustomed to the strident effects of  Wagner and Liszt. A wag in a recent London journal tells us, indeed,  that at the most critical part in the work a gentleman opened one eye  sleepily and said, \"Come in.\"    Simple-hearted Haydn was delighted at the attention lavished on him  in London. He tells us how he enjoyed his various entertainments and  feastings by such dignitaries as William Pitt, the Lord Chancellor, and  the Duke of Lids (Leeds). The gentlemen drank freely the whole night,  and the songs, the crazy uproar, and smashing of glasses were very  great. He went down to stay with the Prince of Wales (George IV.) who  played on the violoncello, and charmed the composer by his kindness. \"He  is the handsomest man on God's earth. He has an extraordinary love of  music, and a great deal of feeling, but very little money.\"    To stem the tide of Haydn's popularity, the Italian faction had recourse  to Giardini; and they even imported a pet pupil of Haydn, Pleyel, to  conduct the rival concerts. Our composer kept his temper, and wrote: \"He  [Pleyel] behaves himself with great modesty.\" Later we read, \"Pleyel's  presumption is a public laughingstock;\" but he adds, \"I go to all his  concerts and applaud him.\"    Far different were the amenities that passed between Haydn and Giardini.  \"I won't know the German hound,\" says the latter. Haydn wrote, \"I  attended his concert at Ranelagh, and he played the fiddle like a hog.\"    Among the pleasant surprises Haydn had in England was his visit to  Herschel, the great astronomer, in whom he recognized one of his old  oboe-players. The big telescope amazed him, and so did the patient  star-gazer, who often sat out-of-doors in the most intense cold for five  or six hours at a time.    Our composer returned to Vienna in May, 1795. with the little fortune of  12,000 florins in his pocket.      V.    In his charming little cottage near Vienna Haydn was the centre of a  brilliant society. Princes and nobles were proud to do honor to him;  and painters, poets, scholars, and musicians made a delightful coterie,  which was not even disturbed by the political convulsions of the time.  The baleful star of Napoleon shot its disturbing influences throughout  Europe, and the roar of his cannon shook the established order of things  with the echoes of what was to come. Haydn was passionately attached to  his country and his emperor, and regarded anxiously the rumblings and  quakings of the period; but he did not intermit his labor, or allow  his consecration to his divine art to be in the least shaken. Like  Archimedes of old, he toiled serenely at his appointed work, while the  political order of things was crumbling before the genius and energy of  the Corsican adventurer.    In 1798 he completed his great oratorio of \"The Creation,\" on which he  had spent three years of toil, and which embodied his brightest genius.  Haydn was usually a very rapid composer, but he seems to have labored  at the \"Creation\" with a sort of reverential humility, which never  permitted him to think his work worthy or complete. It soon went the  round of Germany, and passed to England and France, everywhere awakening  enthusiasm by its great symmetry and beauty. Without the sublimity  of Handel's \"Messiah,\" it is marked by a richness of melody, a serene  elevation, a matchless variety in treatment, which make it the most  characteristic of Haydn's works. Napoleon, the first consul, was  hastening to the opera-house to hear this, January 24, 1801, when he was  stopped by an attempt at assassination.    Two years after \"The Creation\" appeared \"The Seasons,\" founded on  Thomson's poem, also a great work, and one of his last; for the grand  old man was beginning to think of rest, and he only composed two or  three quartets after this. He was now seventy years old, and went but  little from his own home. His chief pleasure was to sit in his shady  garden, and see his friends, who loved to solace the musical patriarch  with cheerful talk and music. Haydn often fell into deep melancholy, and  he tells us that God revived him; for no more sweet, devout nature ever  lived. His art was ever a religion. A touching incident of his old age  occurred at a grand performance of \"The Creation\" in 1808. Haydn was  present, but he was so old and feeble that he had to be wheeled in a  chair into the theatre, where a princess of the house of Ester-hazy  took her seat by his side. This was the last time that Haydn appeared  in public, and a very impressive sight it must have been to see the aged  father of music listening to \"The Creation\" of his younger days, but too  old to take any active share in the performance. The presence of the old  man roused intense enthusiasm among the audience, which could no longer  be suppressed as the chorus and orchestra burst in full power upon the  superb passage, \"And there was light.\"    Amid the tumult of the enraptured audience the old composer was seen  striving to raise himself. Once on his feet, he mustered up all his  strength, and, in reply to the applause of the audience, he cried out  as loud as he was able: \"No, no! not from me, but,\" pointing to heaven,  \"from thence--from heaven above--comes all!\" saying which, he fell back  in his chair, faint and exhausted, and had to be carried out of the  room.    One year after this Vienna was bombarded by the French, and a shot fell  in Haydn's garden. He requested to be led to his piano, and played the  \"Hymn to the Emperor\" three times over with passionate eloquence and  pathos. This was his last performance. He died five days afterward, aged  seventy-seven, and lies buried in the cemetery of Gumpfenzdorf, in his  own beloved Vienna.      VI.    The serene, genial face of Haydn, as seen in his portraits, measures  accurately the character of his music. In both we see health fulness,  good-humor, vivacity, devotional feeling, and warm affections; a mind  contented, but yet attaching high importance to only one thing in life,  the composing of music. Haydn pursued this with a calm, insatiable  industry, without haste, without rest. His works number eight hundred,  comprising cantatas, symphonies, oratorios, masses, concertos, trios,  sonatas, quartets, minuets, etc., and also twenty-two operas, eight  German and fourteen Italian.    As a creative mind in music, Haydn was the father of the quartet and  symphony. Adopting the sonata form as scientifically illustrated by  Emanuel Bach, he introduced it into compositions for the orchestra  and the chamber. He developed these into a completeness and full-orbed  symmetry, which have never been improved. Mozart is richer, Beethoven  more sublime, Schubert more luxuriant, Mendelssohn more orchestral and  passionate; but Haydn has never been surpassed in his keen perception  of the capacities of instruments, his subtile distribution of parts, his  variety in treating his themes, and his charmingly legitimate effects.  He fills a large space in musical history, not merely from the number,  originality, and beauty of his compositions, but as one who represents  an era in art-development.    In Haydn genius and industry were happily united. With a marvelously  rich flow of musical ideas, he clearly knew what he meant to do, and  never neglected the just elaboration of each one. He would labor on a  theme till it had shaped itself into perfect beauty.    Haydn is illustrious in the history of art as a complete artistic life,  which worked out all of its contents as did the great Goethe. In the  words of a charming writer: \"His life was a rounded whole. There was no  broken light about it; it orbed slowly, with a mild, unclouded lustre,  into a perfect star. Time was gentle with him, and Death was kind, for  both waited upon his genius until all was won. Mozart was taken away at  an age when new and dazzling effects had not ceased to flash through  his brain: at the very moment when his harmonies began to have a  prophetic ring of the nineteenth century, it was decreed that he should  not see its dawn. Beethoven himself had but just entered upon an unknown  'sea whose margin seemed to fade forever and forever as he moved;' but  good old Haydn had come into port over a calm sea and after a prosperous  voyage. The laurel wreath was this time woven about silver locks; the  gathered-in harvest was ripe and golden.\"          MOZART.      I.    The life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the immortal names in music,  contradicts the rule that extraordinary youthful talent is apt to be  followed by a sluggish and commonplace maturity. His father entered the  room one day with a friend, and found the child bending over a music  score. The little Mozart, not yet five years old, told his father he was  writing a concerto for the piano. The latter examined it, and tears of  joy and"]]]
