Through this  valley twisted the beck which I had heard faintly in the night. It ran  through the oak plantation and so to the sea, some two or three miles  further on, said my landlady; but nobody would have thought it was so  near.    \"T'squire was to be away to-day,\" observed the woman, with the broad  vowel sound which I shall not attempt to reproduce in print. \"He was  going to Lancaster, I believe.\"    \"So I understood,\" said I. \"I didn't think of troubling him, if that's  what you mean. I'm going to take his advice and fish the beck.\"    And I proceeded to do so after a hearty early dinner: the keen, chill  air was doing me good already: the \"perfect quiet\" was finding its  way into my soul. I blessed my specialist, I blessed Squire Rattray, I  blessed the very villains who had brought us within each other's ken;  and nowhere was my thanksgiving more fervent than in the deep cleft  threaded by the beck; for here the shrewd yet gentle wind passed  completely overhead, and the silence was purged of oppression by the  ceaseless symphony of clear water running over clean stones.    But it was no day for fishing, and no place for the fly, though I went  through the form of throwing one for several hours. Here the stream  merely rinsed its bed, there it stood so still, in pools of liquid  amber, that, when the sun shone, the very pebbles showed their shadows  in the deepest places. Of course I caught nothing; but, towards the  close of the gold-brown afternoon, I made yet another new acquaintance,  in the person of a little old clergyman who attacked me pleasantly from  the rear.    \"Bad day for fishing, sir,\" croaked the cheery voice which first  informed me of his presence. \"Ah, I knew it must be a stranger,\" he  cried as I turned and he hopped down to my side with the activity of a  much younger man.    \"Yes,\" I said, \"I only came down from London yesterday. I find the spot  so delightful that I haven't bothered much about the sport. Still, I've  had about enough of it now.\" And I prepared to take my rod to pieces.    \"Spot and sport!\" laughed the old gentleman. \"Didn't mean it for a  pun, I hope? Never could endure puns! So you came down yesterday, young  gentleman, did you? And where may you be staying?\"    I described the position of my cottage without the slightest hesitation;  for this parson did not scare me; except in appearance he had so  little in common with his type as I knew it. He had, however, about the  shrewdest pair of eyes that I have ever seen, and my answer only served  to intensify their open scrutiny.    \"How on earth did you come to hear of a God-forsaken place like this?\"  said he, making use, I thought, of a somewhat stronger expression than  quite became his cloth.    \"Squire Rattray told me of it,\" said I.    \"Ha! So you're a friend of his, are you?\" And his eyes went through and  through me like knitting-needles through a ball of wool.    \"I could hardly call myself that,\" said I. \"But Mr. Rattray has been  very kind to me.\"    \"Meet him in town?\"    I said I had, but I said it with some coolness, for his tone had dropped  into the confidential, and I disliked it as much as this string of  questions from a stranger.    \"Long ago, sir?\" he pursued.    \"No, sir; not long ago,\" I retorted.    \"May I ask your name?\" said he.    \"You may ask what you like,\" I cried, with a final reversal of all my  first impressions of this impertinent old fellow; \"but I'm hanged if  I tell it you! I am here for rest and quiet, sir. I don't ask you your  name. I can't for the life of me see what right you have to ask me mine,  or to question me at all, for that matter.\"    He favored me with a brief glance of extraordinary suspicion. It faded  away in mere surprise, and, next instant, my elderly and reverend friend  was causing me some compunction by coloring like a boy.    \"You may think my curiosity mere impertinence, sir,\" said he; \"you would  think otherwise if you knew as much as I do of Squire Rattray's friends,  and how little you resemble the generality of them. You might even feel  some sympathy for one of the neighboring clergy, to whom this godless  young man has been for years as a thorn in their side.\"    He spoke so gravely, and what he said was so easy to believe, that I  could not but apologize for my hasty words.    \"Don't name it, sir,\" said the clergyman; \"you had a perfect right to  resent my questions, and I enjoy meeting young men of spirit; but not  when it's an evil spirit, such as, I fear, possesses your friend! I do  assure you, sir, that the best thing I have heard of him for years is  the very little that you have told me. As a rule, to hear of him at all  in this part of the world, is to wish that we had not heard. I see him  coming, however, and shall detain you no longer, for I don't deny that  there is no love lost between us.\"    I looked round, and there was Rattray on the top of the bank, a long  way to the left, coming towards me with a waving hat. An extraordinary  ejaculation brought me to the right-about next instant.    The old clergyman had slipped on a stone in mid-stream, and, as he  dragged a dripping leg up the opposite bank, he had sworn an oath worthy  of the \"godless young man\" who had put him to flight, and on whose  demerits he had descanted with so much eloquence and indignation.          CHAPTER X. WINE AND WEAKNESS      \"Sporting old parson who knows how to swear?\" laughed Rattray. \"Never saw  him in my life before; wondered who the deuce he was.\"    \"Really?\" said I. \"He professed to know something of you.\"    \"Against me, you mean? My dear Cole, don't trouble to perjure yourself.  I don't mind, believe me. They're easily shocked, these country clergy,  and no doubt I'm a bugbear to 'em. Yet, I could have sworn I'd never  seen this one before. Let's have another look.\"    We were walking away together. We turned on the top of the bank. And  there the old clergyman was planted on the moorside, and watching us  intently from under his hollowed hands.    \"Well, I'm hanged!\" exclaimed Rattray, as the hands fell and their  owner beat a hasty retreat. My companion said no more; indeed, for some  minutes we pursued our way in silence. And I thought that it was with an  effort that he broke into sudden inquiries concerning my journey and my  comfort at the cottage.    This gave me an opportunity of thanking him for his little attentions.  \"It was awfully good of you,\" said I, taking his arm as though I had  known him all my life; nor do I think there was another living man with  whom I would have linked arms at that time.    \"Good?\" cried he. \"Nonsense, my dear sir! I'm only afraid you find  it devilish rough. But, at all events, you're coming to dine with me  to-night.\"    \"Am I?\" I asked, smiling.    \"Rather!\" said he. \"My time here is short enough. I don't lose sight of  you again between this and midnight.\"    \"It's most awfully good of you,\" said I again.    \"Wait till you see! You'll find it rough enough at my place; all my  retainers are out for the day at a local show.\"    \"Then I certainly shall not give you the trouble.\"    He interrupted me with his jovial laugh.    \"My good fellow,\" he cried, \"that's the fun of it! How do you suppose  I've been spending the day? Told you I was going to Lancaster, did I?  Well, I've been cooking our dinner instead--laying the table--getting  up the wines--never had such a joke! Give you my word, I almost forgot I  was in the wilderness!\"    \"So you're quite alone, are you?\"    \"Yes; as much so as that other beggar who was monarch of all he  surveyed, his right there was none to dispute, from the what-is-it down  to the glade--\"    \"I'll come,\" said I, as we reached the cottage. \"Only first you must let  me make myself decent.\"    \"You're decent enough!\"    \"My boots are wet; my hands--\"    \"All serene! I'll give you five minutes.\"    And I left him outside, flourishing a handsome watch, while, on my way  upstairs, I paused to tell Mrs. Braithwaite that I was dining at the  hall. She was busy cooking, and I felt prepared for her unpleasant  expression; but she showed no annoyance at my news. I formed the  impression that it was no news to her. And next minute I heard a  whispering below; it was unmistakable in that silent cottage, where not  a word had reached me yet, save in conversation to which I was myself a  party.    I looked out of window. Rattray I could no longer see. And I confess  that I felt both puzzled and annoyed until we walked away together, when  it was his arm which was immediately thrust through mine.    \"A good soul, Jane,\" said he; \"though she made an idiotic marriage, and  leads a life which might spoil the temper of an archangel. She was my  nurse when I was a youngster, Cole, and we never meet without a yarn.\"  Which seemed natural enough; still I failed to perceive why they need  yarn in whispers.    Kirby Hall proved startlingly near at hand. We descended the bare  valley to the right, we crossed the beck upon a plank, were in the  oak-plantation about a minute, and there was the hall upon the farther  side.    And a queer old place it seemed, half farm, half feudal castle: fowls  strutting at large about the back premises (which we were compelled to  skirt), and then a front door of ponderous oak, deep-set between walls  fully six feet thick, and studded all over with wooden pegs. The facade,  indeed, was wholly grim, with a castellated tower at one end, and a  number of narrow, sunken windows looking askance on the wreck and  ruin of a once prim, old-fashioned, high-walled garden. I thought that  Rattray might have shown more respect for the house of his ancestors.  It put me in mind of a neglected grave. And yet I could forgive a bright  young fellow for never coming near so desolate a domain.    We dined delightfully in a large and lofty hall, formerly used (said  Rattray)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#12)"],[1,"\"    So the creditors came, but they were so numerous that by evening the  Prince had but twopence left for himself, and could not go further on  his journey.    Now it so happened that Jack the Giant-Killer on his way to Wales passed  through the town, and, hearing of the Prince's plight, was so taken with  his kindness and generosity that he determined to be the Prince's  servant. So this was agreed upon, and next morning, after Jack had paid  the reckoning with his last farthing, the two set out together. But as  they were leaving the town, an old woman ran after the Prince and called  out, \"Justice! Justice! The dead man owed me twopence these seven years.  Pay me as well as the others.\"    And the Prince, kind and generous, put his hand to his pocket and gave  the old woman the twopence that was left to him. So now they had not a  penny between them, and when the sun grew low the Prince said:    \"Jack! Since we have no money, how are we to get a night's lodging?\"    Then Jack replied, \"We shall do well enough, Master; for within two or  three miles of this place there lives a huge and monstrous giant with  three heads, who can fight four hundred men in armour and make them fly  from him like chaff before the wind.\"    \"And what good will that be to us?\" quoth the Prince. \"He will for sure  chop us up in a mouthful.\"    \"Nay,\" said Jack, laughing. \"Let me go and prepare the way for you. By  all accounts this giant is a dolt. Mayhap I may manage better than  that.\"    So the Prince remained where he was, and Jack pricked his steed at full  speed till he came to the giant's castle, at the gate of which he  knocked so loud that he made the neighbouring hills resound.    On this the giant roared from within in a voice like thunder:    \"Who's there?\"    Then said Jack as bold as brass, \"None but your poor cousin Jack.\"    \"Cousin Jack!\" quoth the giant, astounded. \"And what news with my poor  cousin Jack?\" For, see you, he was quite taken aback; so Jack made haste  to reassure him.    \"Dear coz, heavy news, God wot!\"    \"Heavy news,\" echoed the giant, half afraid. \"God wot, no heavy news can  come to me. Have I not three heads? Can I not fight five hundred men in  armour? Can I not make them fly like chaff before the wind?\"    \"True,\" replied crafty Jack, \"but I came to warn you because the great  King Arthur's son with a thousand men in armour is on his way to kill  you.\"    At this the giant began to shiver and to shake. \"Ah! Cousin Jack! Kind  cousin Jack! This is heavy news indeed,\" quoth he. \"Tell me, what am I  to do?\"    [Illustration: \"Ah! Cousin Jack! Kind cousin Jack! This is heavy news  indeed\"]    \"Hide yourself in the vault,\" says crafty Jack, \"and I will lock and  bolt and bar you in; and keep the key till the Prince has gone. So you  will be safe.\"    Then the giant made haste and ran down into the vault, and Jack locked,  and bolted, and barred him in. Then being thus secure, he went and  fetched his master, and the two made themselves heartily merry over what  the giant was to have had for supper, while the miserable monster  shivered and shook with fright in the underground vault.    Well, after a good night's rest Jack woke his master in early morn, and  having furnished him well with gold and silver from the giant's  treasure, bade him ride three miles forward on his journey. So when Jack  judged that the Prince was pretty well out of the smell of the giant,  he took the key and let his prisoner out. He was half dead with cold and  damp, but very grateful; and he begged Jack to let him know what he  would be given as a reward for saving the giant's life and castle from  destruction, and he should have it.    \"You're very welcome,\" said Jack, who always had his eyes about him.  \"All I want is the old coat and cap, together with the rusty old sword  and slippers which are at your bed-head.\"    When the giant heard this he sighed and shook his head. \"You don't know  what you are asking,\" quoth he. \"They are the most precious things I  possess, but as I have promised, you must have them. The coat will make  you invisible, the cap will tell you all you want to know, the sword  will cut asunder whatever you strike, and the slippers will take you  wherever you want to go in the twinkling of an eye!\"    So Jack, overjoyed, rode away with the coat and cap, the sword and the  slippers, and soon overtook his master; and they rode on together until  they reached the castle where the beautiful lady lived whom the Prince  sought.    Now she was very beautiful, for all she was possessed of seven devils,  and when she heard the Prince sought her as a suitor, she smiled and  ordered a splendid banquet to be prepared for his reception. And she  sate on his right hand, and plied him with food and drink.    And when the repast was over she took out her own handkerchief and  wiped his lips gently, and said, with a smile:    \"I have a task for you, my lord! You must show me that kerchief  to-morrow morning or lose your head.\"    And with that she put the handkerchief in her bosom and said,  \"Good-night!\"    The Prince was in despair, but Jack said nothing till his master was in  bed. Then he put on the old cap he had got from the giant, and lo! in a  minute he knew all that he wanted to know. So, in the dead of the night,  when the beautiful lady called on one of her familiar spirits to carry  her to Lucifer himself, Jack was beforehand with her, and putting on his  coat of darkness and his slippers of swiftness, was there as soon as she  was. And when she gave the handkerchief to the Devil, bidding him keep  it safe, and he put it away on a high shelf, Jack just up and nipped it  away in a trice!    So the next morning, when the beauteous enchanted lady looked to see the  Prince crestfallen, he just made a fine bow and presented her with the  handkerchief.    At first she was terribly disappointed, but, as the day drew on, she  ordered another and still more splendid repast to be got ready. And this  time, when the repast was over, she kissed the Prince full on the lips  and said:    \"I have a task for you, my lover. Show me to-morrow morning the last  lips I kiss to-night or you lose your head.\"    Then the Prince, who by this time was head over ears in love, said  tenderly, \"If you will kiss none but mine, I will.\" Now the beauteous  lady, for all she was possessed by seven devils, could not but see that  the Prince was a very handsome young man; so she blushed a little, and  said:    \"That is neither here nor there: you must show me them, or death is your  portion.\"    So the Prince went to his bed, sorrowful as before; but Jack put on the  cap of knowledge and knew in a moment all he wanted to know.    Thus when, in the dead of the night, the beauteous lady called on her  familiar spirit to take her to Lucifer himself, Jack in his coat of  darkness and his shoes of swiftness was there before her.    \"Thou hast betrayed me once,\" said the beauteous lady to Lucifer,  frowning, \"by letting go my handkerchief. Now will I give thee something  none can steal, and so best the Prince, King's son though he be.\"    With that she kissed the loathly demon full on the lips, and left him.  Whereupon Jack with one blow of the rusty sword of strength cut off  Lucifer's head, and, hiding it under his coat of darkness, brought it  back to his master.    Thus next morning when the beauteous lady, with malice in her beautiful  eyes, asked the Prince to show her the lips she had last kissed, he  pulled out the demon's head by the horns. On that the seven devils,  which possessed the poor lady, gave seven dreadful shrieks and left her.  Thus the enchantment being broken, she appeared in all her perfect  beauty and goodness.    So she and the Prince were married the very next morning. After which  they journeyed back to the court of King Arthur, where Jack the  Giant-Killer, for his many exploits, was made one of the Knights of the  Round Table.      V    This, however, did not satisfy our hero, who was soon on the road again  searching for giants. Now he had not gone far when he came upon one,  seated on a huge block of timber near the entrance to a dark cave. He  was a most terrific giant. His goggle eyes were as coals of fire, his  countenance was grim and gruesome; his cheeks, like huge flitches of  bacon, were covered with a stubbly beard, the bristles of which  resembled rods of iron wire, while the locks of hair that fell on his  brawny shoulders showed like curled snakes or hissing adders. He held a  knotted iron club, and breathed so heavily you could hear him a mile  away. Nothing daunted by this fearsome sight, Jack alighted from his  horse and, putting on his coat of darkness, went close up to the giant  and said softly: \"Hullo! is that you? It will not be long before I have  you fast by your beard.\"    [Illustration: Seated on a huge block of timber near the entrance to a  dark cave]    So saying he made a cut with the sword of strength at the giant's head,  but, somehow, missing his aim, cut off the nose instead, clean as a  whistle! My goodness! How the giant roared! It was like claps of  thunder, and he began to lay about him with the knotted iron club, like  one possessed. But Jack in his coat of darkness easily dodged the  blows, and running in behind, drove the sword up to the hilt into the  giant's back, so that he fell stone dead.    Jack then cut off the head and sent it to King Arthur by a waggoner whom  he hired for the purpose. After which he began to search the giant's  cave to find his treasure. He passed through many windings and turnings  until he came to a huge hall paved and roofed with freestone. At the  upper end of this was an immense fireplace where hung an iron cauldron,  the like of which, for size, Jack had never seen before. It was boiling  and gave out a savoury steam; while beside it, on the right hand, stood  a big massive table set out with huge platters and mugs. Here it was  that the"]]]
