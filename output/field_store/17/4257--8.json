[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#12)"],[1,"years  before the pointillists; _La Pensee_, this masterpiece, evokes  Hoppner. But in everything reappears the invincible French instinct: the  _Jeune Fille au panier_ is a Greuze painted by an Impressionist; the  delightful _Jeune Fille a la promenade_ is connected with Fragonard; the  _Box_, a perfect marvel of elegance and knowledge, condenses the whole  worldliness of 1875. The portrait of _Jeanne Samary_ is an evocation of  the most beautiful portraits of the eighteenth century, a poem of white  satin and golden hair.    [Illustration: RENOIR    YOUNG GIRL PROMENADING]    Renoir's realism bears in spite of all, the imprint of the lyric spirit  and of sweetness. It has neither the nervous veracity of Manet, nor the  bitterness of Degas, who both love their epoch and find it interesting  without idealising it and who have the vision of psychologist novelists.  Before everything else he is a painter. What he sees in the _Bal au  Moulin de la Galette_, are not the stigmata of vice and impudence, the  ridiculous and the sad sides of the doubtful types of this low resort.  He sees the gaiety of Sundays, the flashes of the sun, the oddity of a  crowd carried away by the rhythm of the valses, the laughter, the  clinking of glasses, the vibrating and hot atmosphere; and he applies  to this spectacle of joyous vulgarity his gifts as a sumptuous  colourist, the arabesque of the lines, the gracefulness of his bathers,  and the happy eurythmy of his soul. The straw hats are changed into  gold, the blue jackets are sapphires, and out of a still exact realism  is born a poem of light. The _Dejeuner des Canotiers_ is a subject which  has been painted a hundred times, either for the purpose of studying  popular types, or of painting white table-cloths amidst sunny foliage.  Yet Renoir is the only painter who has raised this small subject to the  proportions and the style of a large canvas, through the pictorial charm  and the masterly richness of the arrangement. The _Box_, conceived in a  low harmony, in a golden twilight, is a work worthy of Reynolds. The  pale and attentive face of the lady makes one think of the great English  master's best works; the necklace, the flesh, the flounce of lace and  the hands are marvels of skill and of taste, which the greatest modern  virtuosos, Sargent and Besnard, have not surpassed, and, as far as the  man in the background is concerned, his white waistcoat, his  dress-coat, his gloved hand would suffice to secure the fame of a  painter. The _Sleeping Woman_, the _First Step_, the _Terrace_, and the  decorative _Dance_ panels reveal Renoir as an _intimiste_ and as an  admirable painter of children. His strange colouring and his gifts of  grasping nature and of ingenuity--strangers to all decadent  complexity--have allowed him to rank among the best of those who have  expressed childhood in its true aspect, without overloading it with  over-precocious thoughts. Finally, Renoir is a painter of flowers of  dazzling variety and exquisite splendour. They supply him with  inexhaustible pretexts for suave and subtle harmonies.    [Illustration: RENOIR    WOMAN'S BUST]    His third manner has surprised and deceived certain admirers of his. It  seems to mix his two first techniques, combining the painting with the  palette knife and the painting in touches of divided tones. He searches  for certain accords and contrasts almost analogous to the musical  dissonances. He realises incredible \"false impressions.\" He seems to  take as themes oriental carpets: he abandons realism and style and  conceives symphonies. He pleases himself in assembling those tones  which one is generally afraid of using: Turkish pink, lemon, crushed  strawberry and viridian. Sometimes he amuses himself with amassing faded  colours which would be disheartening with others, but out of which he  can extract a harmony. Sometimes he plays with the crudest colours. One  feels disturbed, charmed, disconcerted, as one would before an Indian  shawl, a barbaric piece of pottery or a Persian miniature, and one  refrains from forcing into the limits of a definition this exceptional  virtuoso whose passionate love of colour overcomes every difficulty. It  is in this most recent part of his evolution, that Renoir appears the  most capricious and the most poetical of all the painters of his  generation. The flowers find themselves treated in various techniques  according to their own character: the gladioles and roses in pasty  paint, the poor flowers of the field are defined by a cross-hatching of  little touches. Influenced by the purple shadow of the large  flower-decked hats, the heads of young girls are painted on coarse  canvas, sketched in broad strokes, with the hair in one colour only.  Some little study appears like wool, some other has the air of agate,  or is marbled and veined according to his inexplicable whim. We have  here an incessant confusion of methods, a complete emancipation of the  virtuoso who listens only to his fancy. Now and then the harmonies are  false and the drawing incorrect, but these weaknesses do at least no  harm to the values, the character and the general movement of the work,  which are rather accentuated by them.    [Illustration: RENOIR    YOUNG WOMAN IN EMPIRE COSTUME]    Surely, it would be false to exclude ideologist painting which has  produced wonders, and not less iniquitous to reproach Impressionism with  not having taken any interest in it! One has to avoid the kind of  criticism which consists in reproaching one movement with not having had  the qualities of the others whilst maintaining its own, and we have  abandoned the idea of Beauty divided into a certain number of clauses  and programmes, towards the sum total of which the efforts of the  eclectic candidates are directed. M. Renoir is probably the most  representative figure of a movement where he seems to have united all  the qualities of his friends. To criticise him means to criticise  Impressionism itself. Having spent half of its strength in proving to  its adversaries that they were wrong, and the other half in inventing  technical methods, it is not surprising to find that Impressionism has  been wanting in intellectual depth and has left to its successors the  care of realising works of great thought. But it has brought us a sunny  smile, a breath of pure air. It is so fascinating, that one cannot but  love its very mistakes which make it more human and more accessible.  Renoir is the most lyrical, the most musical, the most subtle of the  masters of this art. Some of his landscapes are as beautiful as those of  Claude Monet. His nudes are as masterly in painting as Manet's, and more  supple. Not having attained the scientific drawing which one finds in  Degas's, they have a grace and a brilliancy which Degas's nudes have  never known. If his rare portraits of men are inferior to those of his  rivals, his women's portraits have a frequently superior distinction.  His great modern compositions are equal to the most beautiful works by  Manet and Degas. His inequalities are also more striking than theirs.  Being a fantastic, nervous improvisator he is more exposed to radical  mistakes. But he is a profoundly sincere and conscientious artist.    [Illustration: RENOIR    ON THE TERRACE]    The race speaks in him. It is inexplicable that he should not have met  with startling success, since he is voluptuous, bright, happy and  learned without heaviness. One has to attribute his relative isolation  to the violence of the controversies, and particularly to the dignity of  a poet gently disdainful of public opinion and paying attention solely  to painting, his great and only love. Manet has been a fighter whose  works have created scandal. Renoir has neither shown, nor hidden  himself: he has painted according to his dream, spreading his works,  without mixing up his name or his personality with the tumult that raged  around his friends. And now, for that very reason, his work appears  fresher and younger, more primitive and candid, more intoxicated with  flowers, flesh and sunlight.          VII    THE SECONDARY PAINTERS OF IMPRESSIONISM--CAMILLE PISSARRO, ALFRED  SISLEY, PAUL CEZANNE, BERTHE MORISOT, MISS MARY CASSATT, EVA GONZALES,  GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE, BAZILLE, ALBERT LEBOURG, EUGENE BOUDIN.      Manet, Degas, Monet and Renoir will present themselves as a glorious  quartet of masters, in the history of painting. We must now speak of  some personalities who have grown up by their side and who, without  being great, offer nevertheless a rich and beautiful series of works.    Of these personalities the most considerable is certainly that of M.  Camille Pissarro. He painted according to some wise and somewhat timid  formulas, when Manet's example won him over to Impressionism to which he  has remained faithful. M. Pissarro has been enormously productive. His  work is composed of landscapes, rustic scenes, and studies of streets  and markets. His first landscapes are in the manner of Corot, but bathed  in blond colour: vast cornfields, sunny woods, skies with big, flocking  clouds, effects of soft light--these are the motifs of some charming  canvases which have a solid, classic quality. Later the artist adopted  the method of the dissociation of tones, from which he obtained some  happy effects. His harvest and market scenes are luminous and alive. The  figures in these recall those of Millet. They bear witness to high  qualities of sincere observation, and are the work of a man profoundly  enamoured of rustic life. M. Pissarro excels in grouping the figures, in  correctly catching their attitudes and in rendering the medley of a  crowd in the sun. Certain fans in particular will always remain  delightful caprices of fresh colour, but it would be vain to look in  this attractive, animated and clear painting for the psychologic gifts,  the profound feeling for grand silhouettes, and the intuition of the  worn and gloomy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#12)"],[1,"by  Teddy and the sons, two chauffeurs appeared from the region of the  kitchen and brought Mr. Lawrence Carmine's car and the visitor family's  car to the front door, and everybody drifted gaily through the moonlight  and the big trees to the front of the house. And Mr. Direck saw the  perambulator waiting--the mysterious perambulator--a little in the dark  beyond the front door.    The visitor family and Mr. Carmine and his young Indian departed. \"Come  to hockey!\" shouted Mr. Britling to each departing car-load, and Mr.  Carmine receding answered: \"I'll bring three!\"    Then Mr. Direck, in accordance with a habit that had been growing on him  throughout the evening, looked around for Miss Cissie Corner and failed  to find her. And then behold she was descending the staircase with the  mysterious baby in her arms. She held up a warning finger, and then  glanced at her sleeping burthen. She looked like a silvery Madonna. And  Mr. Direck remembered that he was still in doubt about that baby....    Teddy, who was back in his flannels, seized upon the perambulator. There  was much careful baby stowing on the part of Cecily; she displayed an  infinitely maternal solicitude. Letty was away changing; she reappeared  jauntily taking leave, disregarding the baby absolutely, and Teddy  departed bigamously, wheeling the perambulator between the two sisters  into the hazes of the moonlight. There was much crying of good nights.  Mr. Direck's curiosities narrowed down to a point of great intensity....    Of course, Mr. Britling's circle must be a very \"Advanced\" circle....      Section 10    Mr. Direck found he had taken leave of the rest of the company, and  drifted into a little parlour with Mr. Britling and certain glasses and  siphons and a whisky decanter on a tray....    \"It is a very curious thing,\" said Mr. Direck, \"that in England I find  myself more disposed to take stimulants and that I no longer have the  need for iced water that one feels at home. I ascribe it to a greater  humidity in the air. One is less dried and one is less braced. One is no  longer pursued by a thirst, but one needs something to buck one up a  little. Thank you. That is enough.\"    Mr. Direck took his glass of whisky and soda from Mr. Britling's hand.    Mr. Britling seated himself in an armchair by the fireplace and threw  one leg carelessly over the arm. In his black velvet cloak and cap, and  his black silk tights, he was very like a minor character, a court  chamberlain for example, in some cloak and rapier drama. \"I find this  week-end dancing and kicking about wonderfully wholesome,\" he said.  \"That and our Sunday hockey. One starts the new week clear and bright  about the mind. Friday is always my worst working day.\"    Mr. Direck leant against the table, wrapped in his golden pheasants, and  appreciated the point.    \"Your young people dance very cheerfully,\" he said.    \"We all dance very cheerfully,\" said Mr. Britling.    \"Then this Miss Corner,\" said Mr. Direck, \"she is the sister, I presume,  is she? of that pleasant young lady who is married--she is married,  isn't she?--to the young man you call Teddy.\"    \"I should have explained these young people. They're the sort of young  people we are producing over here now in quite enormous quantity. They  are the sort of equivalent of the Russian Intelligentsia, an  irresponsible middle class with ideas. Teddy, you know, is my secretary.  He's the son, I believe, of a Kilburn solicitor. He was recommended to  me by Datcher of _The Times_. He came down here and lived in lodgings  for a time. Then suddenly appeared the young lady.\"    \"Miss Corner's sister?\"    \"Exactly. The village was a little startled. The cottager who had let  the rooms came to me privately. Teddy is rather touchy on the point of  his personal independence, he considers any demand for explanations as  an insult, and probably all he had said to the old lady was, 'This is  Letty--come to share my rooms.' I put the matter to him very gently.  'Oh, yes,' he said, rather in the manner of some one who has overlooked  a trifle. 'I got married to her in the Christmas holidays. May I bring  her along to see Mrs. Britling?' We induced him to go into a little  cottage I rent. The wife was the daughter of a Colchester journalist and  printer. I don't know if you talked to her.\"    \"I've talked to the sister rather.\"    \"Well, they're both idea'd. They're highly educated in the sense that  they do really think for themselves. Almost fiercely. So does Teddy. If  he thinks he hasn't thought anything he thinks for himself, he goes off  and thinks it different. The sister is a teacher who wants to take the  B.A. degree in London University. Meanwhile she pays the penalty of her  sex.\"    \"Meaning--?\" asked Mr. Direck, startled.    \"Oh! that she puts in a great deal too much of her time upon housework  and minding her sister's baby.\"    \"She's a very interesting and charming young lady indeed,\" said Mr.  Direck. \"With a sort of Western college freedom of mind--and something  about her that isn't American at all.\"    Mr. Britling was following the train of his own thoughts.    \"My household has some amusing contrasts,\" he said. \"I don't know if you  have talked to that German.    \"He's always asking questions. And you tell him any old thing and he  goes and writes it down in his room upstairs, and afterwards asks you  another like it in order to perplex himself by the variety of your  answers. He regards the whole world with a methodical distrust. He wants  to document it and pin it down. He suspects it only too justly of  disorderly impulses, and a capacity for self-contradiction. He is the  most extraordinary contrast to Teddy, whose confidence in the universe  amounts almost to effrontery. Teddy carries our national laxness to a  foolhardy extent. He is capable of leaving his watch in the middle of  Claverings Park and expecting to find it a month later--being carefully  taken care of by a squirrel, I suppose--when he happens to want it. He's  rather like a squirrel himself--without the habit of hoarding. He is  incapable of asking a question about anything; he would be quite sure it  was all right anyhow. He would feel that asking questions betrayed a  want of confidence--was a sort of incivility. But my German, if you  notice,--his normal expression is one of grave solicitude. He is like a  conscientious ticket-collector among his impressions. And did you notice  how beautifully my pianola rolls are all numbered and catalogued? He did  that. He set to work and did it as soon as he got here, just as a good  cat when you bring it into the house sets to work and catches mice.  Previously the pianola music was chaos. You took what God sent you.    \"And he _looks_ like a German,\" said Mr. Britling.    \"He certainly does that,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"He has the fair type of complexion, the rather full habit of body, the  temperamental disposition, but in addition that close-cropped head, it  is almost as if it were shaved, the plumpness, the glasses--those are  things that are made. And the way he carries himself. And the way he  thinks. His meticulousness. When he arrived he was delightful, he was  wearing a student's corps cap and a rucksack, he carried a violin; he  seemed to have come out of a book. No one would ever dare to invent so  German a German for a book. Now, a young Frenchman or a young Italian or  a young Russian coming here might look like a foreigner, but he wouldn't  have the distinctive national stamp a German has. He wouldn't be plainly  French or Italian or Russian. Other peoples are not made; they are  neither made nor created but proceeding--out of a thousand indefinable  causes. The Germans are a triumph of directive will. I had to remark the  other day that when my boys talked German they shouted. 'But when one  talks German one _must_ shout,' said Herr Heinrich. 'It is taught so in  the schools.' And it is. They teach them to shout and to throw out their  chests. Just as they teach them to read notice-boards and not think  about politics. Their very ribs are not their own. My Herr Heinrich is  comparatively a liberal thinker. He asked me the other day, 'But why  should I give myself up to philology? But then,' he reflected, 'it is  what I have to do.'\"    Mr. Britling seemed to have finished, and then just as Mr. Direck was  planning a way of getting the talk back by way of Teddy to Miss Corner,  he snuggled more deeply into his chair, reflected and broke out again.    \"This contrast between Heinrich's carefulness and Teddy's  easy-goingness, come to look at it, is I suppose one of the most  fundamental in the world. It reaches to everything. It mixes up with  education, statecraft, morals. Will you make or will you take? Those are  the two extreme courses in all such things. I suppose the answer of  wisdom to that is, like all wise answers, a compromise. I suppose one  must accept and then make all one can of it.... Have you talked at all  to my eldest son?\"    \"He's a very interesting young man indeed,\" said Mr. Direck. \"I should  venture to say there's a very great deal in him. I was most impressed by  the few words I had with him.\"    \"There, for example, is one of my perplexities,\" said Mr. Britling.    Mr. Direck waited for some further light on this sudden transition.    \"Ah! your troubles in life haven't begun yet. Wait till you're a father.  That cuts to the bone. You have the most delicate thing in the world in  hand, a young kindred mind. You feel responsible for it, you know you  are responsible for it; and you lose touch with it. You can't get at it.  Nowadays we've lost the old tradition of fatherhood by divine right--and  we haven't got a new one. I've tried not to be a cramping ruler, a  director, a domestic tyrant to that lad--and in effect it's meant his  going his own way.... I don't dominate. I hoped to advise. But you see  he loves my respect and good opinion. Too much. When"]]]
