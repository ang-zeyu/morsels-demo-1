I  had not the heart to turn it away, as it seemed quite homeless, and so  the forlorn little mongrel was permitted to make its home in my  house--and a very happy home it proved to be. For three years all went  well, and then the end came swiftly and unexpectedly. I was in  Blackheath at the time, and the mongrel was in Bath. It was All Hallow  E'en, but there was no hempseed sowing, for no one in the house but  myself took the slightest interest in anything appertaining to the  superphysical or mystic. Eleven o'clock came, and I retired to rest; my  bed being one of those antique four-posters, hung with curtains that  shine crimson in the ruddy glow of a cheerful fire. All my preparations  complete, I had pulled back the hangings, and was about to slip in  between the sheets, when, to my unbounded amazement, what should I see  sitting on the counterpane but the black-and-tan mongrel. It was he  right enough, there could not be another such ugly dog, though, unlike  his usual self, he evinced no demonstrations of joy. On the contrary, he  appeared downright miserable. His ears hung, his mouth dropped, and his  bleared little eyes were watery and sad.    \"Greatly perplexed, if not alarmed, at so extraordinary a phenomenon, I  nevertheless felt constrained to put out my hand to comfort him--when,  as I had half anticipated, he immediately vanished. Two days later I  received a letter from Bath, and in a postscript I read that 'the  mongrel' (we never called it by any other name) 'had been run over and  killed by a motor, the accident occurring on All Hallow E'en, about  eleven o'clock.' 'Of course,' my sister wrote, 'you won't mind very  much--it was so extremely ugly, and--well--we were only too glad it was  none of the other dogs.' But my sister was wrong, for notwithstanding  its unsightly appearance and hopeless lack of breed, I had grown to like  that little black-and-tan more than any of my rare and choice pets.\"    The following account, which concludes my notes on hauntings by dog  phantasms, was sent me many years ago by a gentleman then living in  Virginia, U.S.A. It runs thus:--      _The Strange Disappearance of Mr. Jeremiah Dance_    \"Twenty pounds a year for a twelve-roomed house with large front lawn,  good stabling and big kitchen gardens. That sounds all right,\" I  commented. \"But why so cheap?\"    \"Well,\" the advertiser--Mr. Baldwin by name, a short, stout gentleman,  with keen, glittering eyes--replied, \"Well, you see, it's a bit of a  distance from the town, and--er--most people prefer being nearer--like  neighbours and all that sort of thing.\"    \"Like neighbours!\" I exclaimed. \"I don't. I've just seen about enough of  them. Drains all right?\"    \"Oh, yes! Perfect.\"    \"Water?\"    \"Excellent.\"    \"Everything in good condition?\"    \"First rate.\"    \"Loneliness the only thing people object to?\"    \"That is so.\"    \"Then I'll oblige you to send someone to show me over the house, for I  think it is just the sort of place we want. You see, after being bottled  up in a theatre all the afternoon and evening, one likes to get away  somewhere where it is quiet--somewhere where one can lie in bed in the  morning inhaling pure air and undisturbed by street traffic.\"    \"I understand,\" Mr. Baldwin responded, \"but--er--it is rather late now;  wouldn't you prefer to see over it in the morning? Everything looks at  its worst--its very worst--in the twilight.\"    \"Oh, I'll make allowances for the dusk,\" I said. \"You haven't got any  ghosts stowed away there, have you?\" And he went off into a roar of  laughter.    \"No, the house is not haunted,\" Mr. Baldwin replied. \"Not that it would  much matter to you if it were, for I can see you don't believe in  spooks.\"    \"Believe in spooks!\" I cried. \"Not much. I would as soon believe in  patent hair restorers. Let me see over it at once.\"    \"Very well, sir. I'll take you there myself,\" Mr. Baldwin replied,  somewhat reluctantly. \"Here, Tim--fetch the keys of the Crow's Nest and  tell Higgins to bring the trap round.\"    The boy he addressed flew, and in a few minutes the sound of wheels and  the jingling of harness announced the vehicle was at the door.    Ten minutes later and I and my escort were bowling merrily over the  ground in the direction of the Crow's Nest. It was early autumn, and the  cool evening air, fragrant with the mellowness of the luscious Virginian  pippin, was tinged also with the sadness inseparable from the demise of  a long and glorious summer. Evidences of decay and death were  everywhere--in the brown fallen leaves of the oaks and elms; in the bare  and denuded ditches. Here a giant mill-wheel, half immersed in a dark,  still pool, stood idle and silent; there a hovel, but recently inhabited  by hop-pickers, was now tenantless, its glassless windows boarded over,  and a wealth of dead and rotting vegetable matter in thick profusion  over the tiny path and the single stone doorstep.    \"Is it always as quiet and deserted as this?\" I asked of my companion,  who continually cracked his whip as if he liked to hear the  reverberations of its echoes.    \"Always,\" was the reply, \"and sometimes more so. You ain't used to the  country?\"    \"Not very. I want to try it by way of a change. Are you well versed in  the cry of birds? What was that?\"    We were fast approaching an exceedingly gloomy bit of the road where  there were plantations on each side, and the trees united their  fantastically forked branches overhead. I thought I had never seen so  dismal-looking a spot, and a sudden lowering of the temperature made me  draw my overcoat tighter round me.    \"That--oh, a night bird of some sort,\" Mr. Baldwin replied. \"An ugly  sound, wasn't it? Beastly things, I can't imagine why they were created.  Whoa--steady there, steady.\"    The horse reared as he spoke, and taking a violent plunge forward, set  off at a wild gallop. A moment later, and I uttered an exclamation of  astonishment. Keeping pace with us, although apparently not moving at  more than an ordinary walking pace, was a man of medium height, dressed  in a panama hat and albert coat. He had a thin, aquiline nose, a rather  pronounced chin, was clean-shaven, and had a startlingly white  complexion. By the side of him trotted two poodles, whose close-cropped  skins showed out with remarkable perspicuity.    \"Who the deuce is he?\" I asked, raising my voice to a shout on account  of the loud clatter made by the horse's hoofs and the wheels.    \"Who? what?\" Mr. Baldwin shouted in return.    \"Why, the man walking along with us!\"    \"Man! I can see no man!\" Mr. Baldwin growled.    I looked at him curiously. It may, of course, have been due to the  terrific speed we were going, to the difficulty of holding in the horse,  but his cheeks were ashy pale, and his teeth chattered.    \"Do you mean to say,\" I cried, \"that you can see no figure walking on my  side of the horse and actually keeping pace with it?\"    \"Of course I can't,\" Mr. Baldwin snapped. \"No more can you. It's an  hallucination caused by the moonlight through the branches overhead.  I've experienced it more than once.\"    \"Then why don't you have it now?\" I queried.    \"Don't ask so many questions, please,\" Mr. Baldwin shouted. \"Don't you  see it is as much as I can do to hold the brute in? Heaven preserve us,  we were nearly over that time.\"    The trap rose high in the air as he spoke, and then dropped with such a  jolt that I was nearly thrown off, and only saved myself by the skin of  my teeth. A few yards more the spinney ceased, and we were away out in  the open country, plunging and galloping as if our very souls depended  on it. From all sides queer and fantastic shadows of objects, which  certainly had no material counterparts in the moon-kissed sward of the  rich, ripe meadows, rose to greet us, and filled the lane with their  black-and-white wavering, ethereal forms. The evening was one of  wonders for which I had no name--wonders associated with an iciness that  was far from agreeable. I was not at all sure which I liked best--the  black, Stygian, tree-lined part of the road we had just left, or the  wide ocean of brilliant moonbeams and streaked suggestions.    The figures of the man and the dogs were equally vivid in each. Though I  could no longer doubt they were nothing mortal, they were altogether  unlike what I had imagined ghosts. Like the generality of people who are  psychic and who have never had an experience of the superphysical, my  conception of a phantasm was a \"thing\" in white that made ridiculous  groanings and still more ridiculous clankings of chains. But here was  something different, something that looked--save, perhaps, for the  excessive pallor of its cheeks--just like an ordinary man. I knew it was  not a man, partly on account of its extraordinary performance--no man,  even if running at full speed, could keep up with us like that; partly  on account of the unusual nature of the atmosphere--which was altogether  indefinable--it brought with it; and also because of my own  sensations--my intense horror which could not, I felt certain, have been  generated by anything physical.    I cogitated all this in my mind as I gazed at the figure, and in order  to make sure it was no hallucination, I shut first one eye and then the  other, covering them alternately with the palm of my hand. The figure,  however, was still there, still pacing along at our side with the  regular swing, swing of the born walker. We kept on in this fashion till  we arrived at a rusty iron gate leading, by means of a weed-covered  path, to a low, two-storied white house. Here the figures left us, and  as it seemed to me vanished at the foot of the garden wall.    \"This is the house,\" Mr. Baldwin panted, pulling up with the greatest  difficulty, the horse evincing obvious antipathy to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#12)"],[1,"a hole in a tree. On April 28th  he saw a hornbill inspecting the hole, regardless of the noisy  protests of the paroquets. On the 30th he observed that the hole had  become smaller, and suspected that the hornbills had taken possession.  On May 1st all that was left of the hole was a slit. On May 6th Mr.  Currie watched the cock hornbill feeding the hen. First the male bird  came carrying a fig in his bill. Seeing human beings near the nest, he  did not give the fig to the hen but swallowed it and flew off.  Presently the cock reappeared with a fig which he put into the slit in  the plastering; after he had parted with the fig he began to feed the  hen by bringing up food from his crop. During the process the beak of  the hen did not appear at the slit.    On May 7th Mr. Currie opened out the nest. The hole was sixteen feet  from the ground and the orifice had a diameter of three inches; all of  this except a slit, broadest at the lower part, was filled up by  plaster. This plaster was odourless and contained embedded in it a  number of fig seeds.    The nest hole was capacious, its dimensions being roughly 1 foot by 1  foot by 2 feet. From the bottom five handfuls of pieces of dry bark  were extracted. Three white eggs were found lying on these pieces of  bark. The sitting hen resented the \"nest-breaking,\" and, having pecked  viciously at the intruder, tried to escape by climbing up to the top  of the nest hole. She was dragged out of her retreat by the beak,  after an attempt to pull her out by the tail had resulted in all her  tail feathers coming away in her captor's hand!    The young green parrots have all left their nests and are flying about  in noisy flocks. They may be distinguished from the adults by the  short tail and comparatively soft call.    Most pairs of hoopoes are now accompanied by at least one young bird  which is almost indistinguishable from the adults. The young birds  receive, with squeaks of delight, the grubs or caterpillars proffered  by the parents. Occasionally a pair of hoopoes may be seen going  through the antics of courtship preparatory to raising a second brood.    In scrub-jungle parties of partridges, consisting of father, mother  and five or six little chicks, wander about.    As the shades of night begin to fall family parties of spotted owlets  issue from holes in trees or buildings. The baby birds squat on the  ground in silence, while the parents make sallies into the air after  flying insects which they bring to the young birds.    The peafowl and sarus cranes are indulging in the pleasures of  courtship. The young cranes, that were hatched out in the monsoon of  last year, are now nearly as big as their parents, and are well able  to look after themselves; ere long they will be driven away and made  to do so. The display of the sarus is not an elaborate process. The  cock turns his back on the hen and then partially opens his wings, so  that the blackish primaries droop and the grey secondary feathers are  arched. In this attitude he trumpets softly.    The water-hens have already begun their uproarious courtship. Their  weird calls must be heard to be appreciated. They consist of series of  _kok_, _koks_ followed by roars, hiccups, cackles and gurgles.    Black partridges, likewise, are very noisy throughout the month of  May. Their nesting season is fast approaching.    Even as April showers in England bring forth May flowers, so does the  April sunshine in India draw forth the marriage adornments of the  birds that breed in the rains. The pheasant-tailed jacanas are  acquiring the long tail feathers that form the wedding ornaments of  both sexes.    The various species of egret and the paddy bird all assume their  nuptial plumes in May.    In the case of the egret these plumes are in great demand and are  known to the plumage trade as \"ospreys.\"    The plumes in question consist of long filamentous feathers that grow  from the neck of the egret and also from its breast. In most countries  those who obtain these plumes wait until the birds are actually  nesting before attempting to secure them, taking advantage of the fact  that egrets nest in colonies and of the parental affection of the  breeding birds. A few men armed with guns are able to shoot every  adult member of the colony, because the egrets continue to feed their  young until they are shot. As the plumes of these birds are worth  nearly their weight in gold, egrets have become extinct in some parts  of the world.    The export of plumage from India is unlawful, but this fact does not  prevent a very large feather trade being carried on, since it is not  difficult to smuggle \"ospreys\" out of the country.    Doubtless the existing Notification of the Government of India,  prohibiting the export of plumage, has the effect of checking, to some  extent, the destruction of egrets, but there is no denying the fact  that many of the larger species are still shot for their plumes while  breeding.    In the case of cattle-egrets (_Bubulcus coromandus_) the custom of  shooting them when on the nest has given place to a more humane and  more sensible method of obtaining their nuchal plumes. These, as we  have seen, arise early in May, but the birds do not begin to nest  until the end of June. The cattle-egret is gregarious; it is the large  white bird that accompanies cattle in order to secure the insects put  up by the grazing quadrupeds. Taking advantage of the social habits of  these egrets the plume-hunters issue forth early in May and betake  themselves, in parties of five or six, to the villages where the birds  roost. Their apparatus consists of two nets, each some eight feet long  and three broad. These are laid flat on the ground in shallow water,  parallel to one another, about a yard apart. The inner side of each  net is securely pegged to the ground. By an ingenious arrangement of  sticks and ropes a man, taking cover at a distance of twenty or thirty  yards, by giving a sharp pull at a pliable cane, can cause the outer  parts of each net to spring up and meet to form an enclosure which is,  in shape, not unlike a sleeping-pal tent. When the nets have been set  in a pond near the trees where the cattle-egrets roost at night and  rest in the day-time, two or three decoy birds--captured egrets with  their eyes sewn up to prevent them struggling or trying to fly  away--are tethered in the space between the two nets; these last,  being laid flat under muddy water, are invisible. Sooner or later an  egret in one of the trees near by, seeing some of its kind standing  peacefully in the water, alights near them. Almost before it has  touched the ground the cane is pulled and the egret finds itself a  prisoner. One of the bird-catchers immediately runs to the net,  secures the victim, opens out its wings, and, holding each of these  between the big and the second toe, pulls out the nuchal plumes. This  operation lasts about five seconds. The bird is then set at liberty,  far more astonished than hurt. It betakes itself to its wild  companions, and the net is again set. Presently another egret is  caught and divested of its plumes, and the process continues all day.    The bird-catchers spend six weeks every year in obtaining cattle-egret  plumes in this manner. They sell the plumes to middle-men, who dispose  of them to those who smuggle them out of India.    If stuffed birds were used as decoys and the plumes of the captured  birds were snipped off with scissors instead of being pulled out, the  operation could be carried on without any cruelty, and, if legalised  and supervised by the Government, it could be made a source of  considerable revenue.          JUNE      'Tis raging noon; and, vertical, the sun    Darts on the head direct his forceful rays;    O'er heaven and earth, far as the ranging eye    Can sweep, a dazzling deluge reigns; and all    From pole to pole is undistinguish'd blaze.           *       *       *       *       *      All-conquering heat, oh, intermit thy wrath,    And on my throbbing temples potent thus    Beam not so fierce! incessant still you flow,    And still another fervent flood succeeds.

With dancing feet glad peafowl greet    Bright flash and rumbling cloud;    Down channels steep red torrents sweep;    The frogs give welcome loud;           *       *       *       *       *      No stars in skies, but lantern-flies    Seem stars that float to earth.                           WATERFIELD, _Indian Ballads_.      There are two Indian Junes--the June of fiction and the June of fact.  The June of fiction is divided into two equal parts--the dry half and  the wet half. The former is made up of hot days, dull with dust haze,  when the shade temperature may reach 118 degrees, and of oppressive  nights when the air is still and stagnant and the mercury in the  thermometer rarely falls below 84 degrees. Each succeeding period of  four-and-twenty hours seems more disagreeable and unbearable than its  predecessor, until the climax is reached about the 15th June, when  large black clouds appear on the horizon and roll slowly onwards,  accompanied by vivid lightning, loud peals of thunder and torrential  rain. In the June of fact practically the whole month is composed of  hot, dry, dusty, oppressive days; for the monsoon rarely reaches  Northern India before the last week of the month and often tarries  till the middle of July, or even later.    The first rain causes the temperature to fall immediately. It is no  uncommon thing for the mercury in the thermometer to sink 20 degrees  in a few minutes.
