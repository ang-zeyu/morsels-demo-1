At last the dishes were set  on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.  Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving knife, prepared to plunge  it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long-expected gush of  stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all around the board,  and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table  with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried hurrah!    There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was  such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavor, size and cheapness, were  the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by the apple-sauce and  mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family;  indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small  atom of a bone on the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every  one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular were  steeped in sage and onion to the eye-brows! But now, the plates being  changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous  to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up, and bring it in.    Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning  out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard, and  stolen it, while they were merry with the goose; a supposition at which  the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were  supposed.    Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell  like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and  a pastry cook's next door to each other, with a laundress next door to  that! That was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered,  flushed, but smiling proudly, with the pudding like a speckled  cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of  ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.    Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he  regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since  their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind,  she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour.  Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it  was at all a small pudding for so large a family. It would have been  flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a  thing.    At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth  swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and  considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a  shovelful of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew  round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a  one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass--two  tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.    These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden  goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while  the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob  proposed:    \"A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"    Which all the family re-echoed.    \"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.           *       *       *       *       *        GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE        JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY        [From \"Sketches in Prose.\"]        \"God bless us every one!\" prayed Tiny Tim,        Crippled, and dwarfed of body, yet so tall      Of soul, we tiptoe earth to look on him,            High towering over all.        He loved the loveless world, nor dreamed, indeed,        That it, at best, could give to him, the while,      But pitying glances, when his only need            Was but a cheery smile.        And thus he prayed, \"God bless us every one!\"        Enfolding all the creeds within the span      Of his child-heart; and so, despising none,            Was nearer saint than man.        I like to fancy God, in Paradise,        Lifting a finger o'er the rhythmic swing      Of chiming harp and song, with eager eyes            Turned earthward, listening--        The Anthem stilled--the angels leaning there        Above the golden walls--the morning sun      Of Christmas bursting flower-like with the prayer,            \"God bless us Every One!\"           *       *       *       *       *        BELLS ACROSS THE SNOWS        FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL        O Christmas, merry Christmas!        Is it really come again,      With its memories and greetings,        With its joy and with its pain?      There's a minor in the carol,        And a shadow in the light,      And a spray of cypress twining        With the holly wreath to-night.      And the hush is never broken        By laughter light and low,      As we listen in the starlight        To the \"bells across the snow.\"        O Christmas, merry Christmas!        'Tis not so very long      Since other voices blended        With the carol and the song!      If we could but hear them singing        As they are singing now,      If we could but see the radiance        Of the crown on each dear brow;      There would be no sigh to smother,        No hidden tear to flow,      As we listen in the starlight        To the \"bells across the snow.\"        O Christmas, merry Christmas!        This never more can be;      We cannot bring again the days        Of our unshadowed glee.      But Christmas, happy Christmas,        Sweet herald of good-will,      With holy songs of glory        Brings holy gladness still.      For peace and hope may brighten,        And patient love may glow,      As we listen in the starlight        To the \"bells across the snow.\"           *       *       *       *       *        CHRISTMAS BELLS        HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW        I heard the bells on Christmas Day      Their old, familiar carols play,        And wild and sweet        The words repeat      Of peace on earth, good-will to men!        And thought how, as the day had come,      The belfries of all Christendom        Had rolled along        The unbroken song      Of peace on earth, good-will to men!        Till, ringing, swinging on its way,      The world revolved from night to day        A voice, a chime,        A chant sublime      Of peace on earth, good-will to men!        Then from each black, accursed mouth      The cannon thundered in the South        And with the sound        The carols drowned      Of peace on earth, good-will to men!        It was as if an earthquake rent      The hearth-stones of a continent,        And made forlorn        The households born      Of peace on earth, good-will to men!        And in despair I bowed my head;      \"There is no peace on earth,\" I said;        \"For hate is strong        And mocks the song      Of peace on earth, good-will to men!\"        Then pealed the bells more loud and deep.      \"God is not dead; nor doth He sleep!        The Wrong shall fail,        The Right prevail,      With peace on earth, good-will to men!\"           *       *       *       *       *        MINSTRELS AND MAIDS        WILLIAM MORRIS        Outlanders, whence come ye last?        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      Through what green seas and great have ye past?        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        From far away, O masters mine,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      We come to bear you goodly wine,        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        From far away we come to you,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      To tell of great tidings strange and true,        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        News, news of the Trinity,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      And Mary and Joseph from over the sea!        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        For as we wandered far and wide,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      What hap do you deem there should us betide!        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        Under a bent when the night was deep,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      There lay three shepherds tending their sheep.        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        \"O ye shepherds, what have ye seen,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      To slay your sorrow, and heal your teen?\"        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        \"In an ox-stall this night we saw,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      A babe and a maid without a flaw.        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        \"There was an old man there beside,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      His hair was white and his hood was wide.        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        \"And as we gazed this thing upon,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      Those twain knelt down to the Little One,        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        \"And a marvellous song we straight did hear,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      That slew our sorrow and healed our care.\"        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._        News of a fair and marvellous thing,        _The snow in the street and the wind on the door._      Nowell, nowell, nowell, we sing!        _Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor._           *       *       *       *       *    INEXHAUSTIBILITY OF THE SUBJECT OF CHRISTMAS    LEIGH HUNT    So many things have been said of late years about Christmas, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#12)"],[1,"the war?

On the map of the world you will find it not,    'Twas fought by the mothers of men.    Nay, not with cannon or battle shot,    With sword or nobler pen,  Nay, not with eloquent words or thought    From mouths of wonderful men;    But deep in the walled-up woman's heart--    Of woman that would not yield,  But bravely, silently, bore her part--    Lo, there is the battle field!    No marshaling troup, no bivouac song,    No banner to gleam or wave,  But oh, these battles, they last so long--    From babyhood to the grave.    Yet, faithful as a bridge of stars,    She fights in her walled-up town--  Fights on and on in the endless wars,    Then, silent, unseen, goes down.    Oh, ye with banner and battle shot,    And soldiers to shout and praises  I tell you the kingliest victories fought    Were fought in those silent ways.    Oh, spotless in a world of shame,    With splendid and silent scorn,  Go back to God as white as you came--    The kingliest warrior born!        _Joaquin Miller._          Plain Bob and a Job      Bob went lookin' for a job--  Didn't want a situation; didn't ask a lofty station:  Didn't have a special mission for a topnotcher's position;  Didn't have such fine credentials--but he had the real essentials--  Had a head that kept on workin' and two hands that were not shirkin';  Wasn't either shirk or snob;  Wasn't Mister--just plain Bob,  Who was lookin' for a job.    Bob went lookin' for a job;  And he wasn't scared or daunted when he saw a sign--\"Men Wanted,\"  Walked right in with manner fittin' up to where the Boss was sittin',  And he said: \"My name is Bob, and I'm lookin' for a job;  And if you're the Boss that hires 'em, starts 'em working and that            fires 'em,  Put my name right down here, Neighbor, as a candidate for labor;  For my name is just plain 'Bob,  And my pulses sort o' throb  For that thing they call a job.\"  Bob kept askin' for a job,  And the Boss, he says: \"What kind?\" And Bob answered:  \"Never mind;  For I am not a bit partic'ler and I never was a stickler  For proprieties in workin'--if you got some labor lurkin'  Anywhere around about kindly go and trot it out.  It's, a job I want, you see--  Any kind that there may be  Will be good enough for me.\"    Well, sir, Bob he got a job.

Got a feller name of Bob who just asked me for a job--  Never asks when he engages about overtime in wages;  Never asked if he'd get pay by the hour or by the day;  Never asked me if it's airy work and light and sanitary;  Never asked me for my notion of the chances of promotion;  Never asked for the duration of his annual vacation;  Never asked for Saturday half-a-holiday with pay;  Never took me on probation till he tried the situation;  Never asked me if it's sittin' work or standin', or befittin'  Of his birth and inclination--he just filed his application,  Hung his coat up on a knob,  Said his name was just plain Bob--  And went workin' at a job!\"        _James W. Foley._          Aunt Tabitha      Whatever I do and whatever I say,  Aunt Tabitha tells me it isn't the way  When _she_ was a girl (forty summers ago);  Aunt Tabitha tells me they never did so.    Dear aunt! If I only would take her advice!  But I like my own way, and I find it _so_ nice!  And besides, I forget half the things I am told;  But they all will come back to me--when I am old.    If a youth passes by, it may happen, no doubt,  He may chance to look in as I chance to look out;  _She_ would never endure an impertinent stare--  It is _horrid_, she says, and I mustn't sit there.    A walk in the moonlight has pleasures, I own,  But it isn't quite safe to be walking alone;  So I take a lad's arm--just for safety you know--  But Aunt Tabitha tells me _they_ didn't do so.    How wicked we are, and how good they were then!  They kept at arm's length those detestable men;  What an era of virtue she lived in!--But stay--  Were the _men_ all such rogues in Aunt Tabitha's day?    If the men _were_ so wicked, I'll ask my papa  How he dared to propose to my darling mamma;  Was he like the rest of them? Goodness! Who knows?  And what shall _I_ say, if a wretch should propose?    I am thinking if aunt knew so little of sin,  What a wonder Aunt Tabitha's aunt must have been!  And her grand-aunt--it scares me--how shockingly sad  That we girls of to-day are so frightfully bad!    A martyr will save us, and nothing else can,  Let _me perish_--to rescue some wretched young man!  Though when to the altar a victim I go,  Aunt Tabitha'll tell me _she_ never did so!          The Flag Goes By      Hats off!  Along the street there comes  A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,    A flash of color beneath the sky:  Hats off!    The flag is passing by!    Blue and crimson and white it shines,  Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.  Hats off!  The colors before us fly;  But more than the flag is passing by.    Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,  Fought to make and to save the State;  Weary marches and sinking ships;  Cheers of victory on dying lips;    Days of plenty and years of peace,  March of a strong land's swift increase:  Equal justice, right and law,  Stately honor and reverent awe;    Sign of a nation, great and strong,  To ward her people from foreign wrong;  Pride and glory and honor, all  Live in the colors to stand or fall.    Hats off!  Along the street there comes  A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,    And loyal hearts are beating high:  Hats off!    The flag is passing by!        _H.H. Bennett._          The Rivers of France      The rivers of France are ten score and twain,    But five are the names that we know:  The Marne, the Vesle, the Oureq and the Aisne,    And the Somme of the swampy flow.    The rivers of France, from source to sea,    Are nourished by many a rill,  But these five, if ever a drouth there be    The fountains of sorrow would fill.    The rivers of France shine silver white,    But the waters of five are red  With the richest blood, in the fiercest fight    For freedom that ever was shed.    The rivers of France sing soft as they run,    But five have a song of their own,  That hymns the fall of the arrogant one    And the proud cast down from his throne.    The rivers of France all quietly take    To sleep in the house of their birth,  But the carnadined wave of five shall break    On the uttermost strands of earth.    Five rivers of France--see! their names are writ    On a banner of crimson and gold,  And the glory of those who fashioned it    Shall nevermore cease to be told.        _H.J.M., in London \"Times.\"_          Seven Times One      There's no dew left on the daisies and clover,    There's no rain left in heaven;  I've said my \"seven times\" over and over:    Seven times one are seven.    I am old, so old I can write a letter;    My birthday lessons are done;  The lambs play always, they know no better,    They are only one times one.    O Moon! in the night I have seen you sailing    And shining so round and low;  You were bright! but your light is failing,    You are nothing now but a bow.    You Moon, have you done something wrong in heaven,    That God has hidden your face?  I hope if you have, you'll soon be forgiven,    And shine again in your place.    O velvet Bee, you're a dusty fellow;    You've powdered your legs with gold!  O brave Marshmary buds, rich and yellow,    Give me your money to hold!    O Columbine, open your folded wrapper     Where two twin turtle-doves dwell!  O Cuckoo-pint, toll me the purple clapper     That hangs in your clear green bell!    And show me your nest, with the young ones in it,     I will not steal them away;  I am old! you may trust me, linnet, linnet,     I am seven times one to-day.        _Jean Ingelow._          Seven Times Two      You bells in the steeple, ring, ring out your changes,      How many soever they be,  And let the brown meadow-lark's note as he ranges,      Come over, come over to me.    Yet birds' clearest carol by fall or by swelling      No magical sense conveys,  And bells have forgotten their old art of telling      The fortune of future days.    \"Turn again, turn again,\" once they rang cheerily.      While a boy listened alone;  Made his heart yearn again, musing so wearily      All by himself on a stone.    Poor bells! I forgive you; your good days are over,      And mine, they are yet to be;  No listening, no longing shall aught, aught discover:      You leave the story to me.    The foxglove shoots out of the green matted heather,      Preparing her hoods of snow:  She was idle, and slept till the sunshiny weather:      Oh, children take long to grow.    I wish and I wish that the spring would go faster,      Nor long summer bide so late;  And I could grow on like the foxglove and aster,      For some things are ill to wait.    I wait for the day when dear hearts shall discover,      While dear hands are laid on my head:  \"The child is a woman, the book may close over,      For all the lessons are said.\"    I wait for my story--the birds cannot sing it,      Not one, as he sits on the tree;  The bells cannot ring it, but long years, oh bring it!      Such as I wish it to be.        _Jean Ingelow._          Seven Times Three    LOVE      I leaned out of window, I smelt the white clover,    Dark, dark was the garden, I saw not the gate;  \"Now, if there be "]]]
