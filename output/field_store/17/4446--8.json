During the period    1986-91, real GDP expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%.    Tourism makes a direct contribution to GDP of about 13% and also    affects growth in other sectors - particularly in construction,    communications, and public utilities. In 1992, reduced government    capital spending and private sector investment, dampened by recession    in the major world economies, slowed economic growth.

Winona kept very quiet, so as not to attract  the mistress' attention. Marjorie Kemp and Olave Parry had already  translated half of the fatal page, with tolerable credit. Miss Huntley's  eye was wandering in the direction of Irene Mills. Winona dared to  breathe. Then, alas! alas! Some unlucky star caused the mistress to look  back towards the middle of the room. In a spasm of nervousness, Winona  jerked her elbow, and away went her pencil-box, clattering on to the  floor, and dispersing its collection of pens, pencils, nibs and other  treasures beneath the neighboring desks. There was a dead silence, and  the culprit was instantly the center of attention.    \"A clumsy thing to do! Leave those things where they are! You can pick  them up after the lesson,\" observed Miss Huntley grimly. \"Go on now with  the translation.\"    Winona's hot face had been hidden under Audrey Redfern's desk. She rose  reluctantly. Her confusion made the hard passage seem twice as  difficult. Even the words which she had carefully looked up in the  dictionary and learned by heart escaped her fickle memory. She stumbled  and floundered hopelessly, getting redder and redder with shame. Miss  Huntley preserved an ominous silence, and did not attempt to help her  out.    \"That will do!\" she said, at the end of about eight lines. \"After such a  complete exhibition of incompetence we won't inflict any more of your  bungling upon the form. We must see if we can find a way of sharpening  your wits. Your brain seems to have been lying fallow since you came to  school! You will report yourself to Miss Bishop at four o'clock this  afternoon.\"    The rest of the morning passed like a bad dream to Winona. It was a rare  event for a teacher to send a girl to the head mistress. The prospect of  the coming interview made her cold with apprehension. She avoided Garnet  at one o'clock, and hurried out of the dressing-room without speaking  to any one. She had a wild project of pleading a headache, and begging  Aunt Harriet to let her stop at home for the rest of the day. But then  to-morrow's explanations would be infinitely worse. No, it was better to  face the horrible ordeal and get it over. As it happened, Miss Beach had  gone out to lunch, so that leave of absence was an impossibility. Winona  ate her early dinner alone.    \"Aren't you well, miss? Would you like me to make you a cup of tea?\"  asked Alice the housemaid, noticing that the pudding was unappreciated,  and divining that something must be amiss.    \"No, thanks! I'm in a hurry, and must fly off to school as quickly as I  can. It's my early afternoon.\"    Winona had a music lesson at a quarter past two on Thursdays. It was  always rather a rush to get back in time for it. She crammed her \"Bach's  Preludes\" and \"Schubert's Impromptus\" automatically into her portfolio,  and started. It was only when she was half-way down Church Street that  she remembered she had left her book of studies on the top of the piano.  Needless to say, her lesson that day was hardly a success. In the  disturbed state of her mind she was quite incapable of concentrating her  attention on music. Miss Catteral looked surprised at her wrong notes  and imperfect phrasing.    \"I shall expect to find some improvement in this 'Impromptu' next week,\"  she remarked. \"Have you practiced your hour daily? You must take these  bars, which I have marked, separately, and play each twenty times in  succession, slowly at first and then faster, and remember here that it  is the left hand which gives the melody, and the right is only the  accompaniment. I thought you had sufficient music in you to appreciate  that! The way you thumped out those chords was painful. I am not pleased  at all.\"    Miss Catteral so rarely scolded that Winona felt doubly humiliated. It  was all a part and parcel of the general ill-luck of the day. She  fetched her drawing-board, and went to the art class. Here at least she  would have peace for an hour, though every one of the sixty minutes was  bringing her nearer to her dreaded interview. At four o'clock, with a  horrible sinking feeling in her heart, and a trembling sensation in her  knees, she knocked at the door of the head-mistress's study, and entered  in response to the \"Come in!\" which followed. Miss Bishop looked up from  some papers, motioned her to a chair, and went on writing for several  minutes. To Winona it seemed worse than waiting at the dentist's. The  suspense was ghastly.    At last the Principal paused, laid down her pen, and blotted her pages.    \"Come here, Winona Woodward,\" she said quietly. \"I wish to have a  straight talk with you.\"    Miss Bishop's eyes were her most striking feature. They were large and  clear, but the pupils were unusually small, appearing mere black specks  in the midst of a wide circle of blue. This peculiarity gave her a  particularly intense and penetrating expression. Winona, standing at  attention beside the desk, dropped her own eyes before the steady,  searching gaze.    \"Miss Huntley's report of your work is not at all satisfactory,\" began  Miss Bishop. \"I have been watching your progress since you joined the  school, and I cannot think you are trying your best. At first, when you  were totally new to your Form, I suspended judgment, but you have been  here nearly half a term now--quite long enough to accustom yourself to  our methods. I confess I am greatly disappointed. I had hoped for better  things from the holder of a County Scholarship.\"    Winona remained silent. She could think of nothing to say in  self-defense.    \"It must be sheer lack of grit and effort,\" continued Miss Bishop. \"I  cannot understand how a girl who did so remarkably well in the entrance  examination can rest content with such a low record. How long do you  take over your preparation?\"    \"Until my aunt sends me to bed,\" replied Winona, in a very subdued  voice. \"I spend the whole evening at my lessons.\"    Miss Bishop looked puzzled.    \"Then the work must be too difficult for you. If that is the case, I  must remove you to V.b.\"    V.b. was notorious in the school as a refuge for incompetence.  It was mainly composed of girls of sixteen and seventeen who could not  reach the standard of the Sixth, and who went by the nickname of \"owls\"  or \"stupids.\" The prospect of being relegated to such an intellectual  backwater spread palpable dismay over Winona's face. Miss Bishop smiled  rather grimly.    \"We can't win honors without paying the price! You must know that  already by experience. I conclude that you studied hard for the  Scholarship examination? Well, your Form work requires equally close  application. Here is Miss Huntley's report: 'French, weak; Latin,  beneath criticism; mathematics, extremely bad.' Yet in all these three  subjects you gained a high percentage in the entrance examination. I  have your papers here--yes, Latin 85, French 87, mathematics 92\"  (rapidly turning over the pages), \"it is simply incredible how you have  fallen off.\"    Winona was gazing at the sheets of foolscap in the Principal's hand.    \"Those aren't my papers,\" she faltered.    \"Certainly they are. They're marked with your number, 11.\"    \"But I wasn't number 11, I was number 10.\"    Miss Bishop stooped, opened a drawer in her bureau, and took out a book.    \"Here it is in black and white,\" she replied. \"No. 11, Winona Woodward.\"    Winona's shaking hands clutched the edge of the bureau. In a flash the  whole horrible truth was suddenly revealed to her. Until that moment she  had almost forgotten how she and the ruddy-haired girl had collided at  the door of the examination-room, and dropped their cards. In picking  them up, they must have effected an exchange. She remembered that she  had been too agitated to notice her number until after the accident had  happened. She now related the circumstance as best she could. Miss  Bishop listened aghast.    \"What number did you say you took in the examination-room? Ten? That is  entered in my book as Marjorie Kaye. I have the rest of the candidates'  papers in this bundle. Let me see--yes, here is No. 10. Is this your  handwriting? Then I'm afraid there has been a terrible blunder, and the  scholarship has been awarded to the wrong girl.\"    The Principal's consternation was equalled by Winona's. To the latter  the ground seemed slipping from under her feet. She tried to speak, but  failed. A great lump rose in her throat. For a moment the room whirled  round.    \"This set of papers, No. 10, was marked so low as to be out of the  running,\" continued Miss Bishop. \"It is a most unfortunate mistake, and  places the school in an extremely awkward position. I must consult with  the Governors at once. Pending their decision, it will be better not to  mention the matter to anybody. You may go now.\"    Winona managed somehow to get herself out of the study, to put on her  hat and coat, and to walk home to Abbey Close. Her aunt was still  absent, for which she was intensely thankful, and ignoring the tea that  was waiting on the dining-room table, she rushed upstairs to her  bedroom. Her one imperative need was to be alone. She must face the  situation squarely. Her world had suddenly turned topsy-turvy; instead  of being the winner of the County Scholarship, she was among the  rejected candidates. In her heart of hearts she had always marveled how  her indifferent papers could have scored such a success. She wondered  this explanation had never occurred to her before. All this time she had  been wearing another girl's laurels. What was going to happen next? She  supposed the scholarship would be taken from her, and given to its  rightful owner. And herself? She would probably be packed home, as Percy  had prophesied, \"like a whipped puppy.\" Possibly Aunt Harriet might  offer to pay her fee as an ordinary pupil at the High School, but in  either case the humiliation would be supreme.    Winona dreaded returning home. In spite of the difficulty of "]]]
