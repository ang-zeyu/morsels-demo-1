The war  cost so much money that many people were made poor by it; but the  strength of the Indians was broken, and they never dared to trouble  the people of Southern New England again.

Summary.--In 1675 King Philip began a great Indian war against  the people of Southeastern New England. His object was to kill off  the white settlers, and get back the land for the Indians. He did  kill a large number, and he destroyed many villages, but in the end  the white men gained the victory. Philip's wife and child were sold  as slaves, and he was shot. The Indians never attempted another war  in this part of the country.      Who was Wamsutta? What happened to him? Who was \"King Philip\"? Why  did he hate the white men? What did he say to himself?

King Charles the Second gives William Penn a great piece of land,  and names it Pennsylvania.--King Charles the Second of England owed  a large sum of money to a young Englishman named William Penn. The  king was fond of pleasure, and he spent so much money on himself and  his friends that he had none left to pay his just debts. Penn knew  this; so he told His Majesty that if he would give him a piece of  wild land in America, he would ask nothing more.    [Illustration: WILLIAM PENN AT THE AGE OF 22.]    Charles was very glad to settle the account so easily. He therefore  gave Penn a great territory[1] north of Maryland[2] and west of the  Delaware River. This territory was nearly as large as England. The  king named it Pennsylvania, a word which means Penn's Woods. At that  time the land was not thought to be worth much. No one then had  discovered the fact that beneath Penn's Woods there were immense  mines of coal and iron, which would one day be of greater value than  all the riches of the king of England.    [Footnote 1: Territory: any very large extent of land.]    [Footnote 2: See map in paragraph 97.]      97. William Penn's religion; what he wanted to do with his American  land.--Penn belonged to a religious society called the Society of  Friends; to-day they are generally spoken of as Quakers. They are  a people who try to find out what is right by asking their own hearts.  They believe in showing no more signs of respect to one man than to  another, and at that time they would not take off their hats even  to the king himself.    [Illustration: Map of eastern Pennsylvania and surroundings.]    Penn wanted the land which had been given him here as a place where  the Friends or Quakers might go and settle. A little later the whole  of what is now the state of New Jersey was bought by Penn and other  Quakers for the same purpose. We have seen[3] that neither the  Pilgrims nor the Catholics had any real peace in England. The Quakers  suffered even more still; for oftentimes they were cruelly whipped,  thrown into dark and dirty prisons where many died of the bad  treatment they received. William Penn himself had been shut up in  jail four times on account of his religion; and though he was no  longer in such danger, because the king was his friend, yet he wanted  to provide a safe place for others who were not so well off as he  was.    [Footnote 3: See paragraphs 62 and 76.]      98. Penn sends out emigrants to Pennsylvania; he gets ready to go  himself; his conversation with the king.--Penn accordingly sent out  a number of people who were anxious to settle in Pennsylvania. The  next year, 1682, he made ready to sail, himself with a hundred more  emigrants. Just before he started, he called on the king in his palace  in London. The king was fond of joking, and he said to him that he  should never expect to see him again, for he thought that the Indians  would be sure to catch such a good-looking young man as Penn was and  eat him. 'But, Friend Charles,' said Penn, 'I mean to buy the land  of the Indians, so they will rather keep on good terms with me than  eat me.' 'Buy their lands!' exclaimed the king. 'Why, is not the whole  of America mine?' 'Certainly not,' answered Penn. 'What!' replied  the king; 'didn't my people discover it?[4] and so haven't I the right  to it?' 'Well, Friend Charles,' said Penn, 'suppose a canoe full of  Indians should cross the sea and should discover England, would that  make it theirs? Would you give up the country to them?' The king did  not know what to say to this; it was a new way of looking at the matter.  He probably said to himself, These Quakers are a strange people; they  seem to think that even American savages have rights which should  be respected.    [Footnote 4: Referring to the discovery of the American continent  by the Cabots, sent out by Henry the Seventh of England, see paragraph  22.]      99. Penn founds[5] the city of Philadelphia; his treaty[6] with the  Indians; his visit to them; how the Indians and the Quakers got on  together.--When William Penn reached America, in 1682, he sailed up  the broad and beautiful Delaware River for nearly twenty miles. There  he stopped, and resolved to build a city on its banks. He gave the  place the Bible name of Philadelphia,[7] or the City of Brotherly  Love, because he hoped that all of its citizens would live together  like brothers. The streets were named from the trees then growing  on the land, and so to-day many are still called Walnut, Pine, Cedar,  Vine, and so on.    Penn said, \"We intend to sit down lovingly among the Indians.\" On  that account, he held a great meeting with them under a  wide-spreading elm. The tree stood in what is now a part of  Philadelphia. Here Penn and the red men made a treaty or agreement  by which they promised each other that they would live together as  friends as long as the water should run in the rivers, or the sun  shine in the sky.    [Illustration: PENN MAKING THE TREATY WITH THE INDIANS.]    Nearly a hundred years later, while the Revolutionary War was going  on, the British army took possession of the city. It was cold, winter  weather, and the men wanted fire-wood; but the English general  thought so much of William Penn that he set a guard of soldiers round  the great elm, to prevent any one from chopping it down.    Not long after the great meeting under the elm, Penn visited some  of the savages in their wigwams. They treated him to a dinner--or  shall we say a lunch?--of roasted acorns. After their feast, some  of the young savages began to run and leap about, to show the  Englishman what they could do. When Penn was in college at Oxford  he had been fond of doing such things himself. The sight of the Indian  boys made him feel like a boy again; so he sprang up from the ground,  and beat them all at hop, skip, and jump. This completely won the  hearts of the red men.    [Illustration: STATUE OF WILLIAM PENN. (On the Tower of the new City  Hall, Philadelphia.)]    From that time, for sixty years, the Pennsylvania settlers and the  Indians were fast friends. The Indians said, \"The Quakers are honest  men; they do no harm; they are welcome to come here.\" In New England  there had been, as we have seen,[8] a terrible war with the savages,  but in Pennsylvania, no Indian ever shed a drop of Quaker blood.    [Footnote 5: Founds: begins to build.]    [Footnote 6: Treaty: an agreement; and see paragraph 69.]    [Footnote 7: See Rev. i. 11 and iii. 7.]    [Footnote 8: See paragraph 90.]      100. How Philadelphia grew; what was done there in the Revolution;  William Penn's last years and death.--Philadelphia grew quite fast.  William Penn let the people have land very cheap, and he said to them,  \"You shall be governed by laws of your own making.\" Even after  Philadelphia became quite a good-sized town, it had no poor-house,  for none was needed; everybody seemed to be able to take care of  himself.    When the Revolution began, the people of Pennsylvania and of the  country north and south of it sent men to Philadelphia to decide what  should be done. This meeting was called the Congress. It was held  in the old State House, a building which is still standing, and in  1776 Congress declared the United States of America independent of  England. In the war, the people of Delaware and New Jersey fought  side by side with those of Pennsylvania.    William Penn spent a great deal of money in helping Philadelphia and  other settlements. After he returned to England he was put in prison  for debt by a rascally fellow he had employed. He did not owe the  money, and proved that the man who said that he did was no better  than a thief. Penn was released from prison; but his long confinement  in jail had broken his health down. When he died, the Indians of  Pennsylvania sent his widow some beautiful furs, in remembrance of  their \"Brother Penn,\" as they called him. They said that the furs  were to make her a cloak, \"to protect her while passing through this  thorny wilderness without her guide.\"    [Illustration: WILLIAM PENN'S GRAVE AT JORDANS'S MEETING-HOUSE,  ENGLAND.]    About twenty-five miles west of London, on a country road within  sight of the towers of Windsor Castle,[9] there stands a Friends'  meeting-house, or Quaker church.

There  was no trace of resentment at the recent incident in his voice.    \"I do perfectly.\"    \"Then do you not think it somewhat strange that a man like you should be  travelling to Berlin, on the way to Warsaw, on the very day when war was  declared against Russia? Is it not strange also that you should be here  after Great Britain has declared war?\"    \"When I set out for Berlin war had not been declared between Germany and  Russia. On Monday when I was arrested war had not been declared against  Germany by Great Britain. I was arrested on the flimsiest pretext and  upon the word of a deliberately lying youth before war had been declared  with my country!\"    \"Ah! we shall see. You do not think it strange to be travelling through  Germany at such a perilous time with so much photographic apparatus?\"    \"No! I was not using it!\"    \"So you took no photographs in Germany?\"    \"No!\" And the lie flew out in spite of myself. But I felt perfectly  secure because I knew exactly where the film, which I had exposed, was.  It was beyond their reach!    \"Then what is this?\" And to my surprise he held up somewhat  triumphantly the length of photographic film from the camera with which  I had taken the two farewell pictures of my family.    Up to this point I had successfully maintained a stiff upper lip and  perfect composure. But at the sight of the film carrying the parting  pictures, my thoughts flew to home and its associations. I broke down.    The court was jubilant. My spontaneous outburst of weakness at memories  of home was misconstrued into a recognition of the fact that I had been  trapped.    Amid a silence which was soul-burning and which caused my voice,  quivering at first but rapidly regaining strength and its natural ring,  to echo strangely through the room, I narrated the history of that film.  As I had expected it provoked a fearful wrangle. The fight was sharp and  hot while it lasted, but I thanked my lucky stars that I was not only  well skilled in the technics of photography but the chemistry side as  well. The film in question was sufficient for six exposures. Three had  been made. In addition to the two pictures of my family's farewell which  corresponded to exposures two and three there was another picture, of  archaeological interest, concerning a Sussex church, which was exposure  number one. The rest of the film, which would have corresponded to  pictures 4, 5 and 6, had never been exposed.    The film which was held up had been developed by order of the court. The  unexposed portion had been passed through the development processes, and  I experienced a thrill of joy. I saw that I was now on solid ground.    \"How did you expose this film?\"    \"In the usual way. The church was taken first, followed by the two  pictures of my family. The rest of the film has never been exposed.\"    \"That is what you say. But the Court thinks differently. Listen, the two  pictures of your family were taken first and this of the church  last--possibly, indeed probably, in Germany?\"    \"It was not. No photographer, even the tyro, would pass half a film  through his camera before making an exposure.\"    For ten minutes we fought tooth and nail over the way in which that film  had been passed through the camera. Then, seeing that they could not  shake my evidence, and doubtless impressed by my vehemence, they turned  round completely to return to the attack.    \"Well, granted, as you say, that the church was taken first, the second  half of the film was exposed in Germany. But you, seeing the danger of  your position upon arrest, contrived to ruin these last three pictures  before the camera was taken away from you,\" snapped the Chairman.    In spite of myself I laughed.    \"The second half of the film has never been exposed at all,\" I rejoined.    \"How can you prove that?\"    \"Very easily. If I had ruined it by exposing it to the light as you  suggest, _the film upon development would have come out black! But it is  quite transparent!_\" I replied in triumph.    My retort floored the Court. We were dipping into matters about which  they were completely ignorant. There was a hurried whispering and then  the Chairman commented:    \"We'll soon prove that you are wrong!\"    Proceedings were suspended. A clerk left the room to return a little  later with a civilian who proved to be a photographer in Wesel.    The problem was presented to him, but I saw at once that he knew nothing  whatever about the chemistry of photography. He was turned over to me  for cross-examination, and within three minutes I had so pulverised his  statements that he was quite bewildered, and he left the Tribunal with  his photographic reputation sadly shattered.    Another witness was summoned, the Court being determined to get at the  bottom of the problem which had been raised. They certainly recognised  the significance of my contention. This time it was a military officer.  He was examined by the Court, and then I was given the liberty to  cross-examine. My very first question was adequate to satisfy myself  that he knew even less about the subject than the previous witness. But  he was nervously anxious not to betray his ignorance. He had been called  in as an expert and fervently desired to maintain this reputation. He  did so by acquiescing in every statement which I put to him concerning  the action of light upon nitrate of silver.    \"Now,\" I asked emphatically, when I had completely caught him, \"under  these circumstances, and according to what you have been explaining to  the court, the second half of this film which is transparent has never  been exposed?\"    \"It has not.\"    His negative was so emphatic as to convince the Court. I had scored the  crucial point and felt, now my supreme difficulty had been subjugated so  conclusively, that all was plain sailing. It was only too evident that  everything had turned upon that short length of unexposed film, and I  felt devoutly thankful to Providence that the light had not accidentally  penetrated to the sensitised surface. Had the unexposed section been  black my fate would have been irrevocably sealed.    Now I was asked to present my defence.    \"Can you give us a complete and detailed narrative of your journey, say  from the time you left Brighton by the 5.10 p.m. train, on Saturday,  August 1, up to your arrest.\"    I nodded affirmatively.    \"Well, go ahead!\"    Forthwith I launched out. I am naturally a rapid speaker and although my  interpreter was confronted with a gigantic task, he performed his work  magnificently. Only once or twice did he falter for a moment or two. But  I was never interrupted nor asked to repeat a statement, so that the  thread of my story remained unbroken. For two hours and a half I spoke  and I think the readiness and clearness with which I proceeded must have  impressed the Court. As I warmed to the subject my head grew clearer and  clearer. I knew I was fighting for my life, but the whole of the  episodes and scenes during the critical fifty odd hours passed through  my mind as if delineated upon a continuous cinematograph ribbon of film.    Midnight had passed before I had finished. The clerks of the Court had  been steadily writing during the whole period, and I knew that every  word I had uttered had been faithfully recorded. The Tribunal gave a  sigh of relief as I intimated that I had nothing more to say. I was  returned to my cell, accompanied by my interpreter, whom I thanked for  his assistance which I could never repay. The Court might decide what it  liked. I had put up a stiff fight and could do no more. I thought I was  to be left alone for the night. I was sorely in need of rest, and the  nervous tension under which I had been labouring now began to reveal  itself. The reaction commenced to set in. But there was no rest for me  yet. Hardly had I sat down upon my plank bed before I was re-summoned.  By this time I was so weak that I could hardly stand. The perspiration  was pouring out all over my body. Indeed, I had to be assisted up the  stairs.    To my utter surprise, when I entered the court, I found the record of my  defence completed. There it was in a pile of neatly inscribed sheets,  numbered, and secured together. The Chairman pushed the depositions  before me.    \"Sign here,\" and he indicated the foot of the last page.    I picked up the papers. They were in German. I returned them unsigned to  the table.    \"I decline!\" I replied emphatically.    \"But you must!\"    \"Well, I shall not. I don't understand German. I don't know what it's  about!\"    \"It's your defence!\"    \"So it may be, but I have only your word for that. I decline to sign  anything I do not understand. It may be my death warrant!\"    \"If you don't sign I can tell you that we have means of making you do  so,\" he continued somewhat menacingly.    \"I don't care. You can do as you like, but I am not going to sign those  papers.\"    My determination provoked another animated discussion. Finally another  pile was pushed towards me, I could not curb a start. It was my defence  written throughout in English, and had undoubtedly been written  simultaneously with the German version. I eyed the Clerk of the Court  narrowly and he returned the gaze just as keenly.    I ran through the depositions. They were perfect. Picking up the pen I  signed my name without hesitation. The signature was inspected, and then  the original German papers were once more presented with the invitation  to sign. Again, I refused.    \"But,\" expostulated the Chairman, \"this is a literal German translation  from the English which you have signed!\"    \"So it may be, but the fact remains that I don't understand German,\" I  retorted.
