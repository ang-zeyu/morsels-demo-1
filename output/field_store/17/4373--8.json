This conception is perhaps secondary in Buddhism but it is also as old  as the Upanishads and only another form of the doctrine that the  spirit in every man (antaryamin) is identical with the Supreme Spirit.  It is developed in many works still popular in the Far East[118] and  was the fundamental thesis of Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen  school. But the practical character of the Chinese and Japanese has  led them to attach more importance to the moral and intellectual side  of this doctrine than to the metaphysical and pantheistic side.

My present object  is to speak of the Sanskrit literature, chiefly sutras, which appeared  contemporaneously with the rise of Mahayanism in India.    The Mahayanist scriptures are the largest body of sacred writings  extant in the world, but it is not easy either to define the limits of  the Canon or to say when it was put together. According to a common  tradition Kanishka played for the Church of the Great Vehicle much the  same part as Asoka for the Theravadins and summoned a Council which  wrote commentaries on the Tripitaka. This may be reasonably held to  include a recension of the text commented on but we do not know what  that text was, and the brief and perplexing accounts of the Council  which we possess indicate not that it gave its imprimatur to  Mahayanist sutras but that it was specially concerned with the  Abhidharma works of the Sarvastivadin school.    In any case no Canon formed in the time of Kanishka can have been  equivalent to the collections of writings accepted to-day in China and  Tibet, for they contain works later than any date which can be  assigned to his reign, as do also the nine sacred books revered in  Nepal. It was agreed among Indian Buddhists that the scriptures were  divided among the three Pitakas or baskets, but we may surmise that  there was no unanimity as to the precise contents of each basket. In  India the need for unanimity in such matters is not felt. The Brahmans  always recognized that the most holy and most jealously preserved  scriptures could exist in various recensions and the Mahabharata shows  how generations of respectful and uncritical hearers may allow  adventitious matter of all sorts to be incorporated in a work.  Something of the same kind happened with the Pitakas. We know that the  Pali recension which we possess was not the only one, for fragments of  a Sanskrit version have been discovered.    There was probably a large floating literature of sutras, often  presenting several recensions of the same document worked up in  different ways. Just as additions were made to the list of Upanishads  up to the middle ages, although the character of the later works was  different from that of the earlier, so new sutras, modern in date and  in tone, were received in the capacious basket. And just as the  Puranas were accepted as sacred books without undermining the  authority of the Vedas, so new Buddhist scriptures superseded without  condemning the old ones. Various Mahayanist schools had their own  versions of the Vinaya which apparently contain the same rules as the  Pali text but also much additional narrative, and Asanga quotes from  works corresponding to the Pali Nikayas, though his doctrine belongs  to another age.[119] The Abhidharma section of the Pali Canon seems  however to have been peculiar to the Theravada school. The  Sarvastivadin Pitaka of the same name was entirely different and,  judging from the Chinese Canon, the Mahayanists gave the title to  philosophic works by such authors as Asanga and Vasubandhu, some of  which were described as revelations from Maitreya.    Specially characteristic of Mahayanist Buddhism are the Vaipulya[120]  sutras, that is sutras of great extension or development. These works,  of which the Lotus is an example, follow the same scheme as the older  sutras but are of wider scope and on a much larger scale, for they  often consist of twenty or more chapters. They usually attempt to give  a general exposition of the whole Dharma, or at least of some aspect  of it which is extolled as sufficient for the right conduct of life.  The chief speaker is usually the Buddha, who is introduced as teaching  on the Vulture Peak, or some other well-known locality, and surrounded  by a great assemblage many of whom are superhuman beings. The occasion  of the discourse is commonly signalized by his sending forth rays of  light which illuminate the universe until the scene includes other  worlds. As early as the Anguttara Nikaya[121] we find references to  the danger of a taste for ornate and poetic sutras and these  compositions seem to be the outcome of that taste. The literary ideas  and methods which produced them are illustrated by the Sutralankara of  Asvaghosha, a collection of edifying tales, many of which use the  materials supplied by the Pali Nikayas and Vinaya but present them in  a more effective and artistic form. It was thought a pious task to  amplify and embellish the simple narratives handed down by tradition.    The Mahayanist scriptures are composed in Sanskrit not in Pali, but it  is only rarely--for instance in the works of Asvaghosha--that Buddhist  Sanskrit conforms to the rules of the classical language. Usually the  words deviate from this standard both in form and meaning and often  suggest that the text as we have it is a Sanskritized version of an  older work in some popular dialect, brought into partial conformity  with literary usage. In the poetical portions, this process of  sanskritization encountered greater difficulties than in prose,  because metre and prosody often refused to admit the changes required  by grammar, so that this poetical dialect cannot be called either  Sanskrit, Pali or Magadhi but remains a mixture of learned and popular  speech. But Sanskrit did not become a sacred language for the  Mahayanists like Latin for Roman Catholics. It is rather Pali which  has assumed this position among the Hinayanists, for Burmese and  Sinhalese translations of the Pitakas acquired no authority. But in  the north the principle[122] that every man might read the Buddha's  word in his own vernacular was usually respected: and the populations  of Central Asia, the Chinese, the Tibetans, and the Mongols translated  the scriptures into their own languages without attaching any  superstitious importance to the original words, unless they were  Dharanis or spells.
