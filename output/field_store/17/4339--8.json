There are many motions of the body, belonging to the irritative class,  which might by a hasty observer be mistaken for associated ones; as the  peristaltic motion of the stomach and intestines, and the contractions of  the heart and arteries, might be supposed to be associated with the  irritative motions of their nerves of sense, rather than to be excited by  the irritation of their muscular fibres by the distention, acrimony, or  momentum of the blood. So the distention or elongation of muscles by  objects external to them irritates them into contraction, though the  cuticle or other parts may intervene between the stimulating body and the  contracting muscle. Thus a horse voids his excrement when its weight or  bulk irritates the rectum or sphincter ani. These muscles act from the  irritation of distention, when he excludes his excrement, but the muscles  of the abdomen and diaphragm are brought into motion by association with  those of the sphincter and rectum.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. XII.    OF STIMULUS, SENSORIAL EXERTION, AND FIBROUS CONTRACTION.        I. Of fibrous contraction. 1. _Two particles of a fibre cannot approach      without the intervention of something, as in magnetism, electricity,      elasticity. Spirit of life is not electric ether. Galvani's      experiments._ 2. _Contraction of a fibre._ 3. _Relaxation succeeds._ 4.      _Successive contractions, with intervals. Quick pulse from debility,      from paucity of blood. Weak contractions performed in less time, and      with shorter intervals._ 5. _Last situation of the fibres continues      after contraction._ 6. _Contraction greater than usual induces pleasure      or pain._ 7. _Mobility of the fibres uniform. Quantity of sensorial      power fluctuates. Constitutes excitability._ II. Of sensorial exertion.      1. _Animal motion includes stimulus, sensorial power, and contractile      fibres. The sensorial faculties act separately or conjointly. Stimulus      of four kinds. Strength and weakness defined. Sensorial power      perpetually exhausted and renewed. Weakness from defect of stimulus.      From defect of sensorial power, the direct and indirect debility of Dr.      Brown. Why we become warm in Buxton bath after a time, and see well      after a time in a darkish room. Fibres may act violently, or with their      whole force, and yet feebly. Great exertion in inflammation explained.      Great muscular force of some insane people._ 2. _Occasional      accumulation of sensorial power in muscles subject to constant      stimulus. In animals sleeping in winter. In eggs, seeds, schirrous      tumours, tendons, bones._ 3. _Great exertion introduces pleasure or      pain. Inflammation. Libration of the system between torpor and      activity. Fever-fits._ 4. _Desire and aversion introduced. Excess of      volition cures fevers._ III. Of repeated stimulus. 1. _A stimulus      repeated too frequently looses effect. As opium, wine, grief. Hence old      age. Opium and aloes in small doses._ 2. _A stimulus not repeated too      frequently does not lose effect. Perpetual movement of the vital      organs._ 3. _A stimulus repeated at uniform times produces greater      effect. Irritation combined with association._ 4. _A stimulus repeated      frequently and uniformly may be withdrawn, and the action of the organ      will continue. Hence the bark cures agues, and strengthens weak      constitutions._ 5. _Defect of stimulus repeated at certain intervals      causes fever-fits._ 6. _Stimulus long applied ceases to act a second      time._ 7. _If a stimulus excites sensation in an organ not usually      excited into sensation, inflammation is produced._ IV. Of stimulus      greater than natural. 1. _A stimulus greater than natural diminishes      the quantity of sensorial power in general._ 2. _In particular organs._      3. _Induces the organ into spasmodic actions._ 4. _Induces the      antagonist fibres into action._ 5. _Induces the organ into convulsive      or fixed spasms._ 6. _Produces paralysis of the organ._ V. Of stimulus      less than natural. 1. _Stimulus less than natural occasions      accumulation of sensorial power in general._ 2. _In particular organs,      flushing of the face in a frosty morning. In fibres subject to      perpetual stimulus only. Quantity of sensorial power inversely as the      stimulus._ 3. _Induces pain. As of cold, hunger, head-ach._ 4. _Induces      more feeble and frequent contraction. As in low fevers. Which are      frequently owing to deficiency of sensorial power rather than to      deficiency of stimulus._ 5. _Inverts successive trains of motion.      Inverts ideas._ 6. _Induces paralysis and death._ VI. Cure of increased      exertion. 1. _Natural cure of exhaustion of sensorial power._ 2.      _Decrease the irritations. Venesection. Cold. Abstinence._ 3. _Prevent      the previous cold fit. Opium. Bark. Warmth. Anger. Surprise._ 4.      _Excite some other part of the system. Opium and warm bath relieve      pains both from defect and from excess of stimulus._ 5. _First increase      the stimulus above, and then decrease it beneath the natural quantity._      VII. Cure of decreased exertion. 1. _Natural cure by accumulation of      sensorial power. Ague-fits. Syncope._ 2. _Increase the stimulation, by      wine, opium, given so as not to intoxicate. Cheerful ideas._ 3. _Change      the kinds of stimulus._ 4. _Stimulate the associated organs. Blisters      of use in heart-burn, and cold extremities._ 5. _Decrease the      stimulation for a time, cold bath._ 6. _Decrease the stimulation below      natural, and then increase it above natural. Bark after emetics. Opium      after venesection. Practice of Sydenham in chlorosis._ 7. _Prevent      unnecessary expenditure of sensorial power. Decumbent posture, silence,      darkness. Pulse quickened by rising out of bed._ 8. _To the greatest      degree of quiescence apply the least stimulus. Otherwise paralysis or      inflammation of the organ ensues. Gin, wine, blisters, destroy by too      great stimulation in fevers with debility. Intoxication in the      slightest degree succeeded by debility. Golden rule for determining the      best degree of stimulus in low fevers. Another golden rule for      determining the quantity of spirit which those, who are debilitated by      drinking it, may safely omit._    I. _Of fibrous contraction._    1. If two particles of iron lie near each other without motion, and  afterwards approach each other; it is reasonable to conclude that something  besides the iron particles is the cause of their approximation; this  invisible something is termed magnetism. In the same manner, if the  particles, which compose an animal muscle, do not touch each other in the  relaxed state of the muscle, and are brought into contact during the  contraction of the muscle, it is reasonable to conclude, that some other  agent is the cause of this new approximation. For nothing can act, where it  does not exist; for to act includes to exist; and therefore the particles  of the muscular fibre (which in its state of relaxation are supposed not to  touch) cannot affect each other without the influence of some intermediate  agent; this agent is here termed the spirit of animation, or sensorial  power, but may with equal propriety be termed the power, which causes  contraction; or may be called by any other name, which the reader may  choose to affix to it.    The contraction of a muscular fibre may be compared to the following  electric experiment, which is here mentioned not as a philosophical  analogy, but as an illustration or simile to facilitate the conception of a  difficult subject. Let twenty very small Leyden phials properly coated be  hung in a row by fine silk threads at a small distance from each other; let  the internal charge of one phial be positive, and of the other negative  alternately, if a communication be made from the internal surface of the  first to the external surface of the last in the row, they will all of them  instantly approach each other, and thus shorten a line that might connect  them like a muscular fibre. See Botanic Garden, p. 1. Canto I. 1. 202, note  on Gymnotus.    The attractions of electricity or of magnetism do not apply philosophically  to the illustration of the contraction of animal fibres, since the force of  those attractions increases in some proportion inversely as the distance,  but in muscular motion there appears no difference in velocity or strength  during the beginning or end of the contraction, but what may be clearly  ascribed to the varying mechanic advantage in the approximation of one bone  to another. Nor can muscular motion be assimilated with greater  plausibility to the attraction of cohesion or elasticity; for in bending a  steel spring, as a small sword, a less force is required to bend it the  first inch than the second; and the second than the third; the particles of  steel on the convex side of the bent spring endeavouring to restore  themselves more powerfully the further they are drawn from each other. See  Botanic Garden, P. I. addit. Note XVIII.    I am aware that this may be explained another way, by supposing the  elasticity of the spring to depend more on the compression of the particles  on the concave side than on the extension of them on the convex side; and  by supposing the elasticity of the elastic gum to depend more on the  resistance to the lateral compression of its particles than to the  longitudinal extension of them. Nevertheless in muscular contraction, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#12)"],[1,"mple, how an  actual enterprise was carried out, a writer may be able to give his  readers, without their realizing it, all the information they need to  accomplish a similar undertaking. When he analyzes such articles, the  student should not be misled into thinking that the writer did not have  the definite purpose of imparting practical information. If the same  material can be developed into an article of interesting information or  into one of practical guidance, it is desirable to do the latter and, if  necessary, to disguise the purpose.    STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. In order to define his purpose clearly and to keep  it constantly before him, a writer will do well to put down on paper his  exact aim in a single sentence. If, for example, he desired to write a  constructive article about an Americanization pageant held in his home  city on the Fourth of July, he might write out the statement of his aim  thus: \"I desire to show how the Americanization of aliens may be  encouraged in small industrial centers of from 3000 to 20,000  inhabitants, by describing how the last Fourth of July Americanization  pageant was organized and carried out in a typical Pennsylvania  industrial town of 5000.\"    Such a statement will assist a writer in selecting his material, in  sticking to his subject, and in keeping to one point of view. Without  this clearly formulated aim before him, it is easy for him to dwell too  long on some phase of the subject in which he is particularly interested  or on which he has the most material, to the neglect of other phases  that are essential to the accomplishment of his purpose. Or, failing to  get his aim clearly in mind, he may jump from one aspect of the subject  to another, without accomplishing anything in particular. Many a  newspaper and magazine article leaves a confused, hazy impression on the  minds of readers because the writer failed to have a definite objective.          CHAPTER V    TYPES OF ARTICLES      METHODS OF TREATMENT. After choosing a subject and formulating his  purpose, a writer is ready to consider methods of treatment. Again it is  desirable to survey all the possibilities in order to choose the one  method best adapted to his subject and his purpose. His chief  consideration should be the class of readers that he desires to reach.  Some topics, he will find, may be treated with about equal success in  any one of several ways, while others lend themselves to only one or two  forms of presentation. By thinking through the various possible ways of  working out his subject, he will be able to decide which meets his needs  most satisfactorily.    EXPOSITION BY NARRATION AND DESCRIPTION. The commonest method of  developing a special feature article is that which combines narration  and description with exposition. The reason for this combination is not  far to seek. The average person is not attracted by pure exposition. He  is attracted by fiction. Hence the narrative and descriptive devices of  fiction are employed advantageously to supplement expository methods.  Narratives and descriptions also have the advantage of being concrete  and vivid. The rapid reader can grasp a concrete story or a word  picture. He cannot so readily comprehend a more general explanation  unaccompanied by specific examples and graphic pictures of persons,  places, and objects.    Narration and description are used effectively for the concrete examples  and the specific instances by which we illustrate general ideas. The  best way, for example, to make clear the operation of a state system of  health insurance is to relate how it has operated in the case of one or  more persons affected. In explaining a new piece of machinery the writer  may well describe it in operation, to enable readers to visualize it  and follow its motions. Since the reader's interest will be roused the  more quickly if he is given tangible, concrete details that he can  grasp, the examples are usually put first, to be followed by the more  general explanation. Sometimes several examples are given before the  explanatory matter is offered. Whole articles are often made up of  specific examples and generalizations presented alternately.    To explain the effects of a new anaesthetic, for example, Mr. Burton J.  Hendrick in an article in _McClure's Magazine_, pictured the scene in  the operating-room of a hospital where it was being given to a patient,  showed just how it was administered, and presented the results as a  spectator saw them. The beginning of the article on stovaine, the new  anaesthetic, illustrating this method of exposition, follows:        A few months ago, a small six-year-old boy was wheeled into the      operating theater at the Hospital for Ruptured and Crippled      Children, in New York City. He was one of the several thousand      children of the tenements who annually find their way into this      great philanthropic institution, suffering from what, to the lay      mind, seems a hopelessly incurable injury or malformation. This      particular patient had a crippled and paralyzed leg, and to restore      its usefulness, it was necessary to cut deeply into the heel,      stretch the \"Achilles tendon,\" and make other changes which, without      the usual anesthetic, would involve excruciating suffering.      According to the attendant nurses, the child belonged to the \"noisy\"      class; that is, he was extremely sensitive to pain, screamed at the      approach of the surgeon, and could be examined only when forcibly      held down.        As the child came into the operating-room he presented an extremely      pathetic figure--small, naked, thin, with a closely cropped head of      black hair, and a face pinched and blanched with fear. Surrounded by      a fair-sized army of big, muscular surgeons and white-clothed      nurses, and a gallery filled with a hundred or more of the leading      medical men of the metropolis, he certainly seemed a helpless speck      of humanity with all the unknown forces of science and modern life      arrayed against him. Under ordinary conditions he would have been      etherized in an adjoining chamber and brought into the      operating-room entirely unconscious. This cripple, however, had      been selected as a favorable subject for an interesting experiment      in modern surgery, for he was to undergo an extremely torturous      operation in a state of full consciousness.        Among the assembled surgeons was a large-framed, black moustached      and black-haired, quick-moving, gypsy-like Rumanian--Professor      Thomas Jonnesco, dean of the Medical Department of the University of      Bucharest, and one of the leading men of his profession in Europe.      Dr. Jonnesco, who had landed in New York only two days before, had      come to the United States with a definite scientific purpose. This      was to show American surgeons that the most difficult operations      could be performed without pain, without loss of consciousness, and      without the use of the familiar anesthetics, ether or chloroform.      Dr. Jonnesco's reputation in itself assured him the fullest      opportunity of demonstrating his method in New York, and this      six-year-old boy had been selected as an excellent test subject.        Under the gentle assurances of the nurses that \"no one was going to      hurt\" him, the boy assumed a sitting posture on the operating-table,      with his feet dangling over the edge. Then, at the request of Dr.      Jonnesco, he bent his head forward until it almost touched his      breast. This threw the child's back into the desired position--that      of the typical bicycle \"scorcher,\"--making each particular vertebra      stand out sharply under the tight drawn skin. Dr. Jonnesco quickly      ran his finger along the protuberances, and finally selected the      space between the twelfth dorsal and the first lumbar vertebrae--in      other words, the space just above the small of the back. He then      took an ordinary hypodermic needle, and slowly pushed it through the      skin and tissues until it entered the small opening between the      lower and upper vertebrae, not stopping until it reached the open      space just this side of the spinal cord.        As the needle pierced the flesh, the little patient gave a sharp      cry--the only sign of discomfiture displayed during the entire      operation. When the hollow needle reached its destination, a few      drops of a colorless liquid spurted out--the famous cerebro-spinal      fluid, the substance which, like a water-jacket, envelops the brain      and the spinal cord. Into this same place Dr. Jonnesco now      introduced an ordinary surgical syringe, which he had previously      filled with a pale yellowish liquid--the much-famed stovaine,--and      slowly emptied its contents into the region that immediately      surrounds the spinal cord.        For a few minutes the child retained his sitting posture as if      nothing extraordinary had happened. Dr. Jonnesco patted him on the      back and said a few pleasant words in French, while the nurses and      assistants chatted amiably in English.        \"How do you feel now?\" the attending surgeon asked, after the lapse      of three or four minutes.        \"All right,\" replied the boy animatedly, \"'cept that my legs feel      like they was going to sleep.\"        The nurses now laid the patient down upon his back, throwing a      handkerchief over his eyes, so that he could not himself witness the      subsequent proceedings. There was, naturally, much holding of breath      as Dr. Virgil P. Gibney, the operating surgeon, raised his knife and      quickly made a deep incision in the heel of this perfectly conscious      patient. From the child, however, there was not the slightest      evidence of sensation.        \"Didn't you feel anything, my boy?\" asked Dr. Gibney, pausing.        \"No, I don't feel nothin',\" came the response from"]]]
