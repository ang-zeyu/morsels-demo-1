With axe and dagger  in hand, he reached the entrance of a dark passage leading into the  mountain of Mashu,* \"whose gate is guarded day and night by supernatural  beings.\"         * The land of Mashu is the land to the west of the       Euphrates, coterminous on one part with the northern regions       of the Red Sea, on the other with the Persian Gulf; the name       appears to be preserved in that of the classic Mesene, and       possibly in the land of Massa of the Hebrews.    [Illustration: 071.jpg THE SCORPION-MEN OF THE MOUNTAINS OF MASHU.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an Assyrian intaglio.    \"The scorpion-men, of whom the stature extends upwards as far as the  supports of heaven, and of whom the breasts descend as low as Hades,  guard the door. The terror which they inspire strikes down like a  thunderbolt; their look kills, their splendour confounds and overturns  the mountains; they watch over the sun at his rising and setting.  Grilgames perceived them, and his features were distorted with fear and  horror; their savage appearance disturbed his mind. The scorpion-man  said to his wife: 'He who comes towards us, his body is marked by the  gods.'* The scorpion-woman replied to him: 'In his mind he is a god, in  his mortal covering he is a man.' The scorpion-man spoke and said:  'It is as the father of the gods, has commanded, he has travelled over  distant regions before joining us, thee and me.'\" Gilgames learns  that the guardians are not evilly disposed towards him, and becomes  reassured, tell them his misfortunes and implores permission to pass  beyond them so as to reach \"Sha-mashnapishtim, his father, who was  translated to the gods, and who has at his disposal both life and  death.\" The scorpion-man in vain shows to him the perils before him, of  which the horrible darkness enveloping the Mashu mountains is not the  least: Gilgames proceeds through the depths of the darkness for long  hours, and afterwards comes out in the neighbourhood of a marvellous  forest upon the shore of the ocean which encircles the world. One tree  especially excites his wonder: \"As soon as he sees it he runs towards  it. Its fruits are so many precious stones, its boughs are splendid  to look upon, for the branches are weighed down with lapis, and their  fruits are superb.\" When his astonishment had calmed down, Gilgames  begins to grieve, and to curse the ocean which stays his steps. \"Sabitu,  the virgin who is seated on the throne of the seas,\" perceiving him  from a distance, retires at first to her castle, and barricades herself  within it. He calls out to her from the strand, implores and threatens  her in turn, adjures her to help him in his voyage. \"If it can be done,  I will cross the sea; if it cannot be done, I will lay me down on the  land to die.\" The goddess is at length touched by his tears. \"Gilgames,  there has never been a passage hither, and no one from time immemorial  has been able to cross the sea. Shamash the valiant crossed the sea;  after Shamash, who can cross it? The crossing is troublesome, the way  difficult, perilous the Water of Death, which, like a bolt, is drawn  between thee and thy aim. Even if, Gilgames, thou didst cross the  sea, what wouldest thou do on arriving at the Water of Death?\" Arad-Ea,  Shamashnapishtim's mariner, can alone bring the enterprise to a happy  ending: \"if it is possible, thou shalt cross the sea with him; if it is  not possible, thou shalt retrace thy steps.\"    * We must not forget that Gilgames is covered with leprosy; this is the  disease with which the Chaldaean gods mark their enemies when they wish  to punish them in a severe fashion.    [Illustration: 073.jpg GILGAMES AND ARAD-EA NAVIGATING THEIR VESSEL.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a Chaldaean intaglio in the       British Museum. The original measures a little over an inch.    Arad-Ea and the hero took ship: forty days' tempestuous cruising brought  them to the Waters of Death, which with a supreme effort they passed.  Beyond these they rested on their oars and loosed their girdles: the  happy island rose up before them, and Shamashnapishtim stood upon the  shore, ready to answer the questions of his grandson.    None but a god dare enter his mysterious paradise: the bark bearing  an ordinary mortal must stop at some distance from the shore, and the  conversation is carried on from on board. Gilgames narrated once  more the story of his life, and makes known the object of his visit;  Shamashnapishtim answers him stoically that death follows from an  inexorable law, to which it is better to submit with a good grace.  \"However long the time we shall build houses, however long the time we  shall put our seal to contracts, however long the time brothers shall  quarrel with each other, however long the time there shall be hostility  between kings, however long the time rivers shall overflow their banks,  we shall not be able to portray any image of death. When the spirits  salute a man at his birth, then the genii of the earth, the great gods,  Mamitu the moulder of destinies, all of them together assign a fate to  him, they determine for him his life and death; but the day of his death  remains unknown to him.\" Gilgames thinks, doubtless, that his forefather  is amusing himself at his expense in preaching resignation, seeing that  he himself had been able to escape this destiny. \"I look upon thee,  Shamashnapishtim, and thy appearance has not changed: thou art like me  and not different, thou art like me and I am like thee. Thou wouldest  be strong enough of heart to enter upon a combat, to judge by thy  appearance; tell me, then, how thou hast obtained this existence among  the gods to which thou hast aspired?\" Shamashnapishtim yields to his  wish, if only to show him how abnormal his own case was, and indicate  the merits which had marked him out for a destiny superior to that of  the common herd of humanity. He describes the deluge to him, and relates  how he was able to escape from it by the favour of Ea, and how by that  of Bel he was made while living a member of the army of the gods. \"'And  now,' he adds, 'as far as thou art concerned, which one of the Gods will  bestow upon thee the strength to obtain the life which thou seekest?  Come, go to sleep!' Six days and seven nights he is as a man whose  strength appears suspended, for sleep has fallen upon him like a blast  of wind. Shamashnapishtim spoke to his wife: 'Behold this man who asks  for life, and upon whom sleep has fallen like a blast of wind.' The wife  answers Shamashnapishtim, the man of distant lands: 'Cast a spell upon  him, this man, and he will eat of the magic broth; and the road by which  he has come, he will retrace it in health of body; and the great gate  through which he has come forth, he will return by it to his country.'  Shamashnapishtim spoke to his wife: 'The misfortunes of this man  distress thee: very well, cook the broth, and place it by his head.'  And while Gilgames still slept on board his vessel, the material for the  broth was gathered; on the second day it was picked, on the third it was  steeped, on the fourth Shamashnapishtim prepared his pot, on the fifth  he put into it 'Senility,' on the sixth the broth was cooked, on the  seventh he cast his spell suddenly on his man, and the latter consumed  the broth. Then Gilgames spoke to Shamashnapishtim, the inhabitant of  distant lands: 'I hesitated, slumber laid hold of me; thou hast cast a  spell upon me, thou hast given me the broth.'\" The effect would not have  been lasting, if other ceremonies had not followed in addition to this  spell from the sorcerer's kitchen: Gilgames after this preparation could  now land upon the shore of the happy island and purify himself there.  Shamashnapishtim confided this business to his mariner Arad-Ea: \"'The  man whom thou hast brought, his body is covered with ulcers, the leprous  scabs have spoiled the beauty of his body. Take him, Arad-Ea, lead him  to the place of purification, let him wash his ulcers white as snow in  the water, let him get rid of his scabs, and let the sea bear them away  so that at length his body may appear healthy. He will then change  the fillet which binds his brows, and the loin-cloth which hides his  nakedness: until he returns to his country, until he reaches the end of  his journey, let him by no means put off the loin-cloth, however ragged;  then only shall he have always a clean one.' Then Arad-Ea took him and  conducted him to the place of purification: he washed his ulcers white  as snow in the water, he got rid of his scabs, and the sea carried them  away, so that at length his body appeared healthy. He changed the fillet  which bound his brows, the loincloth which hid his nakedness: until  he should reach the end of his journey, he was not to put off the  loin-cloth, however ragged; then alone was he to have a clean one.\" The  cure effected, Gilgames goes again on board his bark, and returns to the  place where Shamashnapishtim was awaiting him.    Shamashnapishtim would not send his descendant back to the land of the  living without making him a princely present. \"His wife spoke to him,  to him Shamashnapishtim, the inhabitant of distant lands: 'Gilgames has  come, he is comforted, he is cured; what wilt thou give to him, now that  he is about to return to his country?' He took the oars, Gilgames, he  brought the bark near the shore, and Shamashnapishtim spoke to him, to  Gilgames: 'Gilgam"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#12)"],[1," names within a cartouche, they assumed  notwithstanding the plenitude of royal power. A favourable opportunity  was therefore offered to an invader, and the Chaldaeans might have  attacked with impunity a people thus divided among themselves.* They  stopped short, however, at the southern frontier of Syria, or if they  pushed further forward, it was without any important result: distance  from head-quarters, or possibly reiterated attacks of the Elamites,  prevented them from placing in the field an adequate force for such a  momentous undertaking. What they had not dared to venture, others more  audacious were to accomplish. At this juncture, so runs the Egyptian  record, \"there came to us a king named Timaios. Under this king, then,  I know not wherefore, the god caused to blow upon us a baleful wind, and  in the face of all probability bands from the East, people of ignoble  race, came upon us unawares, attacked the country, and subdued it easily  and without fighting.\"         * The theory that the divisions of Egypt, under the XIVth       dynasty, and the discords between its feudatory princes,       were one of the main causes of the success of the Shepherds,       is now admitted to be correct.    It is possible that they owed this rapid victory to the presence  in their armies of a factor hitherto unknown to the African--the  war-chariot--and before the horse and his driver the Egyptians gave way  in a body.* The invaders appeared as a cloud of locusts on the banks of  the Nile. Towns and temples were alike pillaged, burnt, and ruined;  they massacred all they could of the male population, reduced to slavery  those of the women and children whose lives they spared, and then  proclaimed as king Salatis, one of their chiefs.** He established a  semblance of regular government, chose Memphis as his capital, and  imposed a tax upon the vanquished. Two perils, however, immediately  threatened the security of his triumph: in the south the Theban lords,  taking matters into their own hands after the downfall of the Xoites,  refused the oath of allegiance to Salatis, and organized an obstinate  resistance;*** in the north he had to take measures to protect  himself against an attack of the Chaldaeans or of the Elamites who were  oppressing Chaldaea.****         * The horse was unknown, or at any rate had not been       employed in. Egypt prior to the invasion; we find it,       however, in general use immediately after the expulsion of       the Shepherds, see the tomb of Pihiri. Moreover, all       historians agree in admitting that it was introduced into       the country under the rule of the Shepherds. The use of the       war-chariot in Chaldaea at an epoch prior to the Hyksos       invasion, is proved by a fragment of the Vulture Stele; it       is therefore, natural to suppose that the Hyksos used the       chariot in war, and that the rapidity of their conquest was       due to it.         ** The name Salatis (var. Saitos) seems to be derived from a       Semitic word, Siialit = \"the chief,\" \"the governor;\" this       was the title which Joseph received when Pharaoh gave him       authority over the whole of Egypt (Gen. xli. 43). Salatis       may not, therefore, have been the real name of the first       Hyksos king, but his title, which the Egyptians       misunderstood, and from which they evolved a proper name:       Uhlemann has, indeed, deduced from this that Manetho, being       familiar with the passage referring to Joseph, had forged       the name of Salatis. Ebers imagined that he could decipher       the Egyptian form of this prince's name on the Colossus of       Tell-Mokdam, where Naville has since read with certainty the       name of a Pharaoh of the XIIIth and XIVth dynasties,       Nahsiri.         *** The text of Manetho speaks of taxes which he imposed on       the high and low lands, which would seem to include the       Thebaid in the kingdom; it is, however, stated in the next       few pages that the successors of Salatis waged an incessant       war against the Egyptians, which can only refer to       hostilities against the Thebans. We are forced, therefore,       to admit, either that Manetho took the title of lord of the       high and low lands which belonged to Salatis, literally, or       that the Thebans, after submitting at first, subsequently       refused to pay tribute, thus provoking a war.         **** Manetho here speaks of Assyrians; this is an error       which is to be explained by the imperfect state of       historical knowledge in Greece at the time of the Macedonian       supremacy. We need not for this reason be led to cast doubt       upon the historic value of the narrative: we must remember       the suzerainty which the kings of Babylon exercised over       Syria, and read _Chaldaeans_ where Manetho has written       _Assyrians_. In Herodotus \"Assyria\" is the regular term for       \"Babylonia,\" and Babylonia is called \"the land of the       Assyrians.\"    From the natives of the Delta, who were temporarily paralysed by their  reverses, he had, for the moment, little to fear: restricting himself,  therefore, to establishing forts at the strategic points in the Nile  valley in order to keep the Thebans in check, he led the main body of  his troops to the frontier on the isthmus. Pacific immigrations had  already introduced Asiatic settlers into the Delta, and thus prepared  the way for securing the supremacy of the new rulers; in the midst of  these strangers, and on the ruins of the ancient town of Hawarit-Avaris,  in the Sethro'ifce nome--a place connected by tradition with the myth  of Osiris and Typhon--Salatis constructed an immense entrenched camp,  capable of sheltering two hundred and forty thousand men. He visited it  yearly to witness the military manoeuvres, to pay his soldiers, and  to preside over the distribution of rations. This permanent garrison  protected him from a Chaldaean invasion, a not unlikely event as long as  Syria remained under the supremacy of the Babylonian kings; it furnished  his successors also with an inexhaustible supply of trained soldiers,  thus enabling them to complete the conquest of Lower Egypt. Years  elapsed before the princes of the south would declare themselves  vanquished, and five kings--Anon, Apachnas, Apophis I., Iannas, and  Asses--passed their lifetime \"in a perpetual warfare, desirous of  tearing up Egypt to the very root.\" These Theban kings, who were  continually under arms against the barbarians, were subsequently classed  in a dynasty by themselves, the XVth of Manetho, but they at last  succumbed to the invader, and Asses became master of the entire country.  His successors in their turn formed a dynasty, the XVIth, the few  remaining monuments of which are found scattered over the length and  breadth of the valley from the shores of the Mediterranean to the rocks  of the first cataract.    The Egyptians who witnessed the advent of this Asiatic people called  them by the general term Amuu, Asiatics, or Monatiu, the men of the  desert.* They had already given the Bedouin the opprobrious epithet of  Shausu--pillagers or robbers--which aptly described them;** and they  subsequently applied the same name to the intruders--Hiq Shausu--from  which the Greeks derived their word Hyksos, or Hykoussos, for this  people.***         * The meaning of the term _Moniti_ was discovered by E. de       Rouge, who translated it _Shepherd_, and applied it to the       Hyksos; from thence it passed into the works of all the       Egyptologists who concerned themselves with this question,       but _Shepherd_ has not been universally accepted as the       meaning of the word. It is generally agreed that it was a       generic term, indicating the races with which their       conquerors were supposed to be connected, and not the       particular term of which Manetho's word _Hoiveves_ would be       the literal translation.         ** The name seems, in fact, to be derived from a word which       meant \"to rob,\" \"to pillage.\" The name Shausu, Shosu, was       not used by the Egyptians to indicate a particular race. It       was used of all Bedouins, and in general of all the       marauding tribes who infested the desert or the mountains.       The Shausu most frequently referred to on the monuments are       those from the desert between Egypt and Syria, but there is       a reference, in the time of Ramses II., to those from the       Lebanon and the valley of Orontes. Krall finds an allusion       to them in a word (_Shosim_) in _Judges_ ii. 14, which is       generally translated by a generic expression, \"the       spoilers.\"         *** Manetho declares that the people were called Hyksos,       from _Syk_, which means \"king\" in the sacred language, and       _sos_, which means \"shepherd\" in the popular language. As a       matter of fact, the word _Hyku_ means \"prince \"in the       classical language of Egypt, or, as Manetho styles it, the       _sacred language_, i.e. in the idiom of the old religious,       historical, and literary texts, which in later ages the       populace no longer understood. Shos, on the contrary,       belongs to the spoken language of the later time, and does       not occur in the ancient inscriptions, so that Manetho's       explanation is valueless; there is but one material fact to       be retained from his evidence, and that is the name _Hyk-       Shos_ or _Hyku-Shos_ given by its inventors to the alien       kings. Cham-pollion and Rosellini were the first to identify       these Shos with the Shausu whom they found represented on       the monuments, and their opinion, adopted by some, seems to       me an extremely plausible one: the Egyptians, at a given       moment, bestowed the generic name of Shausu on these       strangers, just as they had given those of Amuu and Manatiu.
