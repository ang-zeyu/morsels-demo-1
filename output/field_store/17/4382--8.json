The star [beta] Librae is a beautiful light-green star to the naked eye;  in the telescope a wide double, pale emerald and light blue.    In Scorpio there are several very beautiful objects:--    The star Antares or Cor Scorpionis is one of the most beautiful of the  red stars. It has been termed the Sirius of red stars, a term better  merited perhaps by Aldebaran, save for this that, in our latitude,  Antares is, like Sirius, always seen as a brilliant \"scintillator\"  (because always low down), whereas Aldebaran rises high above the  horizon. Antares is a double star, its companion being a minute green  star. In southern latitudes the companion of Antares may be seen with a  good 4-inch, but in our latitudes a larger opening is wanted. Mr. Dawes  once saw the companion of Antares shining alone for seven seconds, the  primary being hidden by the moon. He found that the colour of the  secondary is not merely the effect of contrast, but that this small star  is really a green sun.    The star [beta] Scorpionis is a fine double, the components 13\".1 apart,  their magnitudes 2 and 5-1/2, colours white and lilac. It has been  supposed that this pair is only an optical double, but a long time must  elapse before a decisive opinion can be pronounced on such a point.    The star [sigma] Scorpionis is a wider but much more difficult double,  the smaller component being below the 9th magnitude. The colour of the  primary (4) is white, that of the secondary maroon.    The star [xi] Scorpionis is a neat double, the components 7\".2 apart,  their magnitudes 4-1/2 and 7-1/2, their colours white and grey. This  star is really triple, a fifth-magnitude star lying close to the  primary.    In Ophiuchus, a constellation covering a wide space immediately above  Scorpio, there are several fine doubles. Among others--    39 Ophiuchi, distance between components 12\".1, their magnitudes 5-1/2  and 7-1/2, their colours orange and blue.    The star 70 Ophiuchi, a fourth-magnitude star on the right shoulder of  Ophiuchus, is a noted double. The distance between the components about  5-1/2\", their magnitudes 4-1/2 and 7, the colours yellow and red. The  pair form a system whose period of revolution is about 95 years.    36 Ophiuchi (variable), distance 5\".2, magnitudes 4-1/2 and 6-1/2,  colours red and yellow.    [rho] Opiuchi, distance 4\", colours yellow and blue, magnitudes 5 and 7.    Between [alpha] and [beta] Scorpionis the fine nebula 80 M may be looked  for. (Or more closely thus:--below [beta] is the wide Double [omega]^{1}  and [omega]^{2} Scorpionis; about as far to the right of Antares is the  star [sigma] Scorpionis, and immediately above this is the  fifth-magnitude star 19.) The nebula we seek lies between 19 and  [omega], nearer to 19 (about two-fifths of the way towards [omega]).  This nebula is described by Sir W. Herschel as \"the richest and most  condensed mass of stars which the firmament offers to the contemplation  of astronomers.\"    There are two other objects conveniently situated for observation, which  the observer may now turn to. The first is the great cluster in the  sword-hand of Perseus (see Plate 4), now lying about 28 deg. above the  horizon between N.E. and N.N.E. The stars [gamma] and [delta] Cassiopeiae  (see Map 3 of Frontispiece) point towards this cluster, which is rather  farther from [delta] than [delta] from [gamma], and a little south of  the produced line from these stars. The cluster is well seen with the  naked eye, even in nearly full moonlight. In a telescope of moderate  power this cluster is a magnificent object, and no telescope has yet  revealed its full glory. The view in Plate 5 gives but the faintest  conception of the glories of [chi] Persei. Sir W. Herschel tried in  vain to gauge the depths of this cluster with his most powerful  telescope. He spoke of the most distant parts as sending light to us  which must have started 4000 or 5000 years ago. But it appears  improbable that the cluster has in reality so enormous a longitudinal  extension compared with its transverse section as this view would imply.  On the contrary, I think we may gather from the appearance of this  cluster, that stars are far less uniform in size than has been commonly  supposed, and that the mere irresolvability of a cluster is no proof of  excessive distance. It is unlikely that the faintest component of the  cluster is farther off than the brightest (a seventh-magnitude star) in  the proportion of more than about 20 to 19, while the ordinary estimate  of star magnitudes, applied by Herschel, gave a proportion of 20 or 30  to 1 at least. I can no more believe that the components of this cluster  are stars greatly varying in distance, but accidentally seen in nearly  the same direction, (or that they form an _enormously long system_  turned by accident directly towards the earth), than I could look on the  association of several thousand persons in the form of a procession as a  fortuitous arrangement.    Next there is the great nebula in Andromeda--known as \"the  transcendantly beautiful queen of the nebulae.\" It will not be difficult  to find this object. The stars [epsilon] and [delta] Cassiopeiae (Map 3,  Frontispiece) point to the star [beta] Andromedae. Almost in a vertical  line above this star are two fourth-magnitude stars [mu] and [gamma],  and close above [nu], a little to the right, is the object we  seek--visible to the naked eye as a faint misty spot. To tell the truth,  the transcendantly beautiful queen of the nebulae is rather a  disappointing object in an ordinary telescope. There is seen a long  oval or lenticular spot of light, very bright near the centre,  especially with low powers. But there is a want of the interest  attaching to the strange figure of the Great Orion nebula. The Andromeda  nebula has been partially resolved by Lord Rosse's great reflector, and  (it is said) more satisfactorily by the great refractor of Harvard  College. In the spectroscope, Mr. Huggins informs us, the spectrum is  peculiar. Continuous from the blue to the orange, the light there  \"appears to cease very abruptly;\" there is no indication of gaseity.    Lastly, the observer may turn to the pair Mizar and Alcor, the former  the middle star in the Great Bear's tail, the latter 15' off. It seems  quite clear, by the way, that Alcor has increased in brilliancy of late,  since among the Arabians it was considered an evidence of very good  eyesight to detect Alcor, whereas this star may now be easily seen even  in nearly full moonlight. Mizar is a double star, and a fourth star is  seen in the same field of view with the others (see Plate 5). The  distance between Mizar and its companion is 14\".4; the magnitude of  Mizar 3, of the companion 5; their colours white and pale green,  respectively.          CHAPTER V.    A HALF-HOUR WITH ANDROMEDA, CYGNUS, ETC.      Our last half-hour with the double stars, &c., must be a short one, as  we have already nearly filled the space allotted to these objects. The  observations now to be made are supposed to take place during the fourth  quarter of the year,--at ten o'clock on October 23rd; or at nine on  November 7th; or at eight on November 22nd; or at seven on December 6th;  or at hours intermediate to these on intermediate days.    We look first, as in former cases, for the Great Bear, now lying low  down towards the north. Towards the north-east, a few degrees easterly,  are the twin-stars Castor and Pollux, in a vertical position, Castor  uppermost. Above these, a little towards the right, we see the brilliant  Capella; and between Capella and the zenith is seen the festoon of  Perseus. Cassiopeia lies near the zenith, towards the north, and the  Milky Way extends from the eastern horizon across the zenith to the  western horizon. Low down in the east is Orion, half risen above  horizon. Turning to the south, we see high up above the horizon the  square of Pegasus. Low down towards the south-south-west is Fomalhaut,  pointed to by [beta] and [alpha] Pegasi. Towards the west, about  half-way between the zenith and the horizon, is the noble cross in  Cygnus; below which, towards the left, we see Altair, and his companions  [beta] and [gamma] Aquilae: while towards the right we see the brilliant  Vega.    During this half-hour we shall not confine ourselves to any particular  region of the heavens, but sweep the most conveniently situated  constellations.    [Illustration: PLATE V.]    First, however, we should recommend the observer to try and get a good  view of the great nebula in Andromeda, which is _not_ conveniently  situated for observation, but is so high that after a little trouble the  observer may expect a more distinct view than in the previous quarter.  He will see [beta] Andromedae towards the south-east, about 18 deg. from the  zenith, [mu] and [nu] nearly in a line towards the zenith, and the  nebula about half-way between [beta] and the zenith.    With a similar object it will be well to take another view of the great  cluster in Perseus, about 18 deg. from the zenith towards the  east-north-east (_see_ the pointers [gamma] and [delta] Cassiopeiae in  Map 4, Frontispiece), the cluster being between [delta] Cassiopeiae and  [alpha] Persei.    Not very far off is the wonderful variable Algol, now due east, and  about 58 deg. above the horizon. The variability of this celebrated object  was doubtless discovered in very ancient times, since the name Al-gol,  or \"the Demon\" seems to point to a knowledge of the peculiarity of this  \"slowly winking eye.\" To Goodricke, however, is due the rediscovery of  Algol's variability. The period of variation is 2d. 20h. 48m.; during  2h. 14m. Algol appears of the second magnitude; the remaining 6-3/4  hours are occupied by the gradual decline of the star to the fourth  magnitude, and its equally gradual return to the second. It will be  found easy to watch the variations of this singular object,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16772"],[0,"The Story of a Soul (L'Histoire d'une Âme): The Autobiography of St. Thérèse of (#12)"],[1,"afternoon I read the act of consecration to Our Lady,  for myself and my companions. I was chosen probably because I had  been deprived of my earthly Mother while still so young. With all  my heart I consecrated myself to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and  asked her to watch over me. She seemed to look lovingly on her  Little Flower and to smile at her again, and I thought of the  visible smile which had once cured me, and of all I owed her. Had  she not herself, on the morning of that 8th of May, placed in the  garden of my soul her Son Jesus--\"the Flower of the field and the  Lily of the valleys\"?[4]    On the evening of this happy day Papa and I went to the Carmel,  and I saw Pauline, now become the Spouse of Christ. She wore a  white veil like mine and a crown of roses. My joy was unclouded,  for I hoped soon to join her, and at her side to wait for Heaven.    I was pleased with the feast prepared for me at home, and was  delighted with the beautiful watch given to me by Papa. My  happiness was perfect, and nothing troubled the inward peace of my  soul. Night came, and so ended that beautiful day. Even the  brightest days are followed by darkness; one alone will know no  setting, the day of the First and Eternal Communion in our true  Home. Somehow the next day seemed sorrowful. The pretty clothes  and the presents I had received could not satisfy me. Henceforth  Our Lord alone could fill my heart, and all I longed for was the  blissful moment when I should receive Him again.    I made my second Communion on Ascension Day, and had the happiness  of kneeling at the rails between Papa and Marie. My tears flowed  with inexpressible sweetness; I kept repeating those words of St.  Paul: \"I live now, not I; but Christ liveth in me.\"[5] After this  second visit of Our Lord I longed for nothing else but to receive  Him. Alas! the feasts seemed so far apart. . . .    On the eve of these happy days Marie helped me to prepare, as she  had done for my First Communion. I remember once she spoke of  suffering, and said that in all probability, instead of making me  walk by this road, God, in His goodness, would carry me always  like a little child. Her words came into my mind next day after my  Communion; my heart became inflamed with an ardent desire for  suffering, and I felt convinced that many crosses were in store  for me. Then my soul was flooded with such consolation as I have  never since experienced. Suffering became attractive, and I found  in it charms which held me spellbound, though as yet I did not  appreciate them to the full.    I had one other great wish; it was to love God only, and to find  my joy in Him alone. During my thanksgiving after Holy Communion I  often repeated this passage from the _Imitation of Christ:_ \"O my  God, who art unspeakable sweetness, turn for me into bitterness  all the consolations of earth.\"[6] These words rose to my lips  quite naturally; I said them like a child, who, without well  understanding, repeats what a friend may suggest. Later on I will  tell you, dear Mother, how Our Lord has been pleased to fulfill my  desire, how He, and He alone, has always been my joy; but if I  were to speak of it now I should have to pass on to my girlhood,  and there is still much to tell you of my early days.    Soon after my First Communion I went into retreat again, before  being confirmed. I prepared myself with the greatest care for the  coming of the Holy Ghost; I could not understand anyone not doing  so before receiving this Sacrament of Love. As the ceremony could  not take place on the day fixed, I had the consolation of  remaining somewhat longer in retreat. How happy I felt! Like the  Apostles, I looked with joy for the promised Comforter, gladdened  by the thought that I should soon be a perfect Christan, and have  the holy Cross, the symbol of this wondrous Sacrament, traced upon  my forehead for eternity. I did not feel the mighty wind of the  first Pentecost, but rather the gentle breeze which the prophet  Elias heard on Mount Horeb. On that day I received the gift of  fortitude in suffering--a gift I needed sorely, for the martyrdom  of my soul was soon to begin.    When these delightful feasts, which can never be forgotten, were  over, I had to resume my life as a day scholar, at the Abbey. I  made good progress with my lessons, and remembered easily the  sense of what I read, but I had the greatest difficulty in  learning by heart; only at catechism were my efforts crowned with  success. The Chaplain called me his little \"Doctor of  Theology,\"[7] no doubt because of my name, Therese.    During recreation I often gave myself up to serious thoughts,  while from a distance I watched my companions at play. This was my  favourite occupation, but I had another which gave me real  pleasure. I would search carefully for any poor little birds that  had fallen dead under the big trees, and I then buried them with  great ceremony, all in the same cemetery, in a special grass plot.  Sometimes I told stories to my companions, and often even the big  girls came to listen; but soon our mistress, very rightly, brought  my career as an orator to an end, saying she wanted us to exercise  our bodies and not our brains. At this time I chose as friends two  little girls of my own age; but how shallow are the hearts of  creatures! One of them had to stay at home for some months; while  she was away I thought about her very often, and on her return I  showed how pleased I was. However, all I got was a glance of  indifference--my friendship was not appreciated. I felt this very  keenly, and I no longer sought an affection which had proved so  inconstant. Nevertheless I still love my little school friend, and  continue to pray for her, for God has given me a faithful heart,  and when once I love, I love for ever.    Observing that some of the girls were very devoted to one or other  of the mistresses, I tried to imitate them, but I never succeeded  in winning special favour. O happy failure, from how many evils  have you saved me! I am most thankful to Our Lord that He let me  find only bitterness in earthly friendships. With a heart like  mine, I should have been taken captive and had my wings clipped,  and how then should I have been able to \"fly away and be at  rest\"?[8]    How can a heart given up to human affections be closely united to  God? It seems to me that it is impossible. I have seen so many  souls, allured by this false light, fly right into it like poor  moths, and burn their wings, and then return, wounded, to Our  Lord, the Divine fire which burns and does not consume. I know  well Our Lord saw that I was too weak to be exposed to temptation,  for, without doubt, had the deceitful light of created love  dazzled my eyes, I should have been entirely consumed. Where  strong souls find joy and practise detachment faithfully, I only  found bitterness. No merit, then, is due to me for not having  given up to these frail ties, since I was only preserved from them  by the Mercy of God. I fully realised that without Him I should  have fallen as low as St. Mary Magdalen, and the Divine Master's  words re-echoed sweetly in my soul. Yes, I know that \"To whom less  is forgiven he loveth less,\"[9] but I know too that Our Lord has  forgiven me more than St. Mary Magdalen. Here is an example which  will, at any rate, show you some of my thoughts.    Let us suppose that the son of a very clever doctor, stumbling  over a stone on the road, falls and breaks his leg. His father  hastens to him, lifts him lovingly, and binds up the fractured  limb, putting forth all his skill. The son, when cured, displays  the utmost gratitude, and he has excellent reason for doing so.  But let us take another supposition.    The father, aware that a dangerous stone lies in his son's path,  is beforehand with the danger and removes it, unseen by anyone.  The son, thus tenderly cared for, not knowing of the mishap from  which his father's hand has saved him, naturally will not show him  any gratitude, and will love him less than if he had cured him of  a grievous wound. But suppose he heard the whole truth, would he  not in that case love him still more? Well now, I am this child,  the object of the foreseeing love of a Father \"Who did not send  His son to call the just, but sinners.\"[10] He wishes me to love  Him, because He has forgiven me, not much, but everything. Without  waiting for me to love Him much, as St. Mary Magdalen did, He has  made me understand how He has loved me with an ineffable love and  forethought, so that now my love may know no bounds.    I had often heard it said, both in retreats and elsewhere, that He  is more deeply loved by repentant souls than by those who have not  lost their baptismal innocence. Ah! If I could but give the lie to  those words. . . .    But I have wandered so far from my subject that I hardly know  where to begin again. It was during the retreat before my second  Communion that I was attacked by the terrible disease of scruples.  One must have passed through this martyrdom to understand it. It  would be quite impossible for me to tell you what I suffered for  nearly two years. All my thoughts and actions, even the simplest,  were a source of trouble and anguish to me; I had no peace till I  had told Marie everything, and this was most painful, since I  imagined I was obliged to tell absolutely all my thoughts, even  the most extravagant. As soon as I had unburdened myself I felt a  momentary peace, but it passed like a flash, and my martyrdom  began again. Many an occasion for patience did I provide for my  dear sister.    That year we spent a fortnight of our holidays at the sea-side. My  aunt, who always showed us such motherly care, treated us to all  possible pleasures--donkey rides, shrimping, and the rest. She  even spoiled us in the matter of clothes. I remember one day she  gave me some pale blue ribbon; although I was twelve and a half, I  was still such a"]]]
