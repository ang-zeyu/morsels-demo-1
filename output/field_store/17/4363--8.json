[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#12)"],[1,"  The English are marvelously trained in making use of ground. One       never sees them, and one is constantly under fire. The French       airmen perform wonderful feats. We cannot get rid of them. As soon       as an airman has flown over us, ten minutes later we get their       shrapnel fire in our positions. We have little artillery in our       corps; without it we cannot get forward.         Three days ago our division took possession of these heights and       dug itself in. Two days ago, early in the morning, we were attacked       by an immensely superior English force, one brigade and two       battalions, and were turned out of our positions. The fellows took       five guns from us. It was a tremendous hand-to-hand fight.         How I escaped myself I am not clear. I then had to bring up       supports on foot. My horse was wounded, and the others were too       far in the rear. Then came up the Guards Jager Battalion, Fourth       Jager, Sixth Regiment, Reserve Regiment Thirteen, and Landwehr       Regiments Thirteen and Sixteen, and with the help of the artillery       we drove the fellows out of the position again. Our machine guns       did excellent work; the English fell in heaps.         In our battalion three Iron Crosses have been given, one to C.O.,       one to Capt. ----, and one to Surgeon ----. [Names probably       deleted.] Let us hope that we shall be the lucky ones next time.         During the first two days of the battle I had only one piece of       bread and no water. I spent the night in the rain without my       overcoat. The rest of my kit was on the horses which had been left       behind with the baggage and which cannot come up into the battle       because as soon as you put your nose up from behind cover the       bullets whistle.         War is terrible. We are all hoping that a decisive battle will end       the war, as our troops already have got round Paris. If we beat the       English the French resistance will soon be broken. Russia will be       very quickly dealt with; of this there is no doubt.         We received splendid help from the Austrian [Transcriber: original       'Austrain'] heavy artillery at Maubeuge. They bombarded Fort       Cerfontaine in such a way that there was not ten meters a parapet       which did not show enormous craters made by the shells. The armored       turrets were found upside down.         Yesterday evening, about 6, in the valley in which our reserves       stood there was such a terrible cannonade that we saw nothing of       the sky but a cloud of smoke. We had few casualties.    Recently a pilot and observer of the Royal Flying Corps were forced by a  breakage in their aeroplane to descend in the enemy's lines. The pilot  managed to pancake his machine down to earth, and the two escaped into  some thick under-growth in the woods.    The enemy came up and seized and smashed the machine, but did not search  for our men with much zeal. The latter lay hid till dark and then found  their way to the Aisne, across which they swam, reaching camp in safety,  but barefooted.    Numerous floating bridges have been thrown across the Aisne and some of  the pontoon bridges have been repaired under fire. On the 20th, Lieut.  [name deleted] of the Third Signal Corps, Royal Engineers, was  unfortunately drowned while attempting to swim across the river with a  cable in order to open up fresh telegraphic communication on the north  side.    Espionage is still carried on by the enemy to a considerable extent.  Recently the suspicions of some of the French troops were aroused by  coming across a farm from which the horses had been removed. After some  search they discovered a telephone which was connected by an underground  cable with the German lines, and the owner of the farm paid the penalty  in the usual way in war for his treachery.    After some cases of village fighting which occurred earlier in the war  it was reported by some of our officers that the Germans had attempted  to approach to close quarters by forcing prisoners to march in front of  them. The Germans have recently repeated the same trick on a larger  scale against the French, as is shown by the copy of an order printed  below. It is therein referred to as a ruse, but, if that term can be  accepted, a distinctly illegal ruse.    \"During a recent night attack,\" the order reads, \"the Germans drove a  column of French prisoners in front of them. This action is to be  brought to the notice of all our troops (1) in order to put them on  their guard against such a dastardly ruse; (2) in order that every  soldier may know how the Germans treat their prisoners. Our troops must  not forget if they allow themselves to be taken prisoners the Germans  will not fail to expose them to French bullets.\"    Further evidence has now been collected of the misuse of the white flag  and other signs of surrender. During an action on the 17th, owing to  this, one officer was shot. During recent fighting, also, some German  ambulance wagons advanced in order to collect the wounded. An order to  cease firing was consequently given to our guns, which were firing on  this particular section of ground. The German battery commanders at once  took advantage of the lull in the action to climb up their observation  ladders and on to a haystack to locate our guns, which soon afterward  came under a far more accurate fire than any to which they had been  subjected up to that time.    A British officer, who was captured by the Germans and has since  escaped, reports that while a prisoner he saw men who had been fighting  subsequently put on Red Cross brassards.    That irregular use of the protection afforded by the Geneva Convention  is not uncommon is confirmed by the fact that on one occasion men in the  uniform of combatant units have been captured wearing a Red Cross  brassard hastily slipped over the arm. The excuse given has been that  they had been detailed after the fight to look after the wounded.    It is reported by a cavalry officer that the driver of a motor car with  a machine gun mounted on it, which was captured, was wearing a Red  Cross.    Full details of the actual damage done to the cathedral at Rheims will  doubtless have been cabled home, so that no description of it is  necessary. The Germans bombarded the cathedral twice with their heavy  artillery.    One reason it caught alight so quickly was that on one side of it was  some scaffolding which had been erected for restoration work. Straw had  also been laid on the floor for the reception of the German wounded. It  is to the credit of the French that practically all the German wounded  were successfully extricated from the burning building.    There was no justification on military grounds for this act of  vandalism, which seems to have been caused by exasperation born of  failure--a sign of impotence rather than strength. It is noteworthy that  a well-known hotel not far from the cathedral, which was kept by a  German, was not touched.          III.    *Two September Days.*    [Made Public Sept. 28.]      For four days there has been a comparative lull all along our front.  This has been accompanied [Transcriber: original 'acompanied'] by a  spell of fine weather, though the nights have been much colder. One  cannot have everything, however, and one evil result of the sunshine  has been the release of flies, which were torpid during the wet days.    Advantage has been taken of the arrival of reinforcements to relieve by  fresh troops the men who have been on the firing line for some time.  Several units, therefore, have received their baptism of fire during the  week.    Since the last letter left headquarters evidence has been received which  points to the fact that during the counter attacks on the night of Sept.  20 German detachments of infantry fired into each other. This was the  result of an attempt to carry out the dangerous expedient of a  converging advance in the dark. Opposite one portion of our position  considerable massing of hostile forces was observed before dark. Some  hours later a furious fusillade [Transcriber: original 'fusilade'] was  heard in front of our line, though no bullets came over our trenches.    This narrative begins with Sept. 21 and covers only two days. There was  but little rain on Sept. 21 and the weather took a turn for the better,  which has been maintained. The action has been practically confined to  the artillery, our guns at one point shelling and driving the enemy, who  endeavored to construct a redoubt.    The Germans expended a large number of heavy shells in a long range  bombardment of the village of Missy (Department of the Aisne).  Reconnoitring parties sent out during the night of Sept. 21-22  discovered some deserted trenches. In them or in the woods over 100 dead  and wounded were picked up. A number of rifles, ammunition and equipment  were also found. There were other signs that portions of the enemy's  forces had withdrawn some distance.    The weather was also fine on Sept. 22 with less wind, and it was one of  the most uneventful days we have passed since we reached the Aisne, that  is, uneventful for the British. There was less artillery work on either  side, the Germans giving the village of Paissy (Aisne) a taste of the  \"Jack Johnsons.\" The spot thus honored is not far from the ridge where  there has been some of the most severe close fighting in which we have  taken part. All over this No Man's Land, between the lines, bodies of  German infantrymen were still lying in heaps where they had fallen at  different times.    Espionage plays so large a part in the conduct of the war by the Germans  that it is difficult to avoid further reference to the subject. They  have evidently never forgotten the saying of Frederick the Great: \"When  Marshall Soubise goes to war he is followed by a hundred cooks. When I  take the field I am preceded by a hundred spies.\" Indeed until "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#12)"],[1,"  serve as a means of attachment and articulation for the radius and  metacarpal bones.    The transverse diameter of this joint is long, thus giving it contacting  surfaces that are sufficiently extensive to minimize the strain upon the  mesial and lateral ligaments (internal and external lateral common  ligaments). Motion is that of flexion and extension; slight rotation is  possible when the position is that of flexion. While supporting weight  the carpus is fixed in position by a slight dorsal flexion, but undue  dorsal flexion is prevented by the flexor muscles and tendons and  volar-carpal or annular ligament, together with the superior check  ligament.    The metacarpophalangeal articulation (fetlock joint), is a hinge joint  and its articular surfaces contact one another, with respect to their  having a long bearing surface from side to side, as do all ginglymus  (hinge) joints. Two common lateral ligaments bind the bones together.  While bearing weight, there is assumed a position of slight dorsal  flexion, undue flexion being checked by the inhibitory apparatus of the  joint--check ligaments, and their tendons and the suspensory ligament.  The inhibitory apparatus of the fetlock joint is materially reinforced  by the proximal sesamoid bones. Situated as they are, between the  bifurcating portions of the suspensory ligament and the posterior part  of the distal end of the metacarpus--with which they articulate--the  sesamoid bones serve to change the course of the branches of the  suspensory ligament in a manner that they give firm support to this  joint. Volar flexion is limited by the extensors of the phalanges.    [Illustration: Fig. 4--Sagital Section of Digit and Distal Part of  Metacarpus.    A, Metacarpal bone; B, first phalanx; C, second phalanx, D, third  phalanx; E, distal sesamoid bone; 1, volar pouch of capsule of fetlock  joint; 2, inter-sesamoidean ligament; 3, 4, proximal end of digital  synovial sheath; 5, ring formed by superficial flexor tendon; 6, fibrous  tissue underlying ergot; 7, ergot; 8, 9, 9', branches of digital  vessels; 10, distal ligament of distal sesamoid bone; 11, suspensory  ligament of distal sesamoid bone; 12, 12', proximal and distal ends of  bursa podotrochlearis. (From Sisson's \"Anatomy of the Domestic  Animals\").]    The first phalanx (os suffraginis) normally sets at an angle of about  50 to 55 degrees from a horizontal plane while weight is being  supported. Its distal end articulates with the second or median phalanx  (os corona) and forms the proximal interphalangeal (pastern or  suffraginocoronary) joint. This also, is a ginglymus joint, having but  slight lateral motion, and that only when it is in a state of flexion. A  rather broad articular surface--from side to side--exists here,  lessening the strain on the collateral ligaments somewhat. Dorsal  flexion is checked by the flexor tendons and dorsal ligaments. Volar  flexion is restrained by the extensor tendons.    The distal end of the second phalanx (os corona) has but slight lateral  motion and this is manifested principally when it is in a state of volar  flexion. Undue dorsal flexion is prevented by the deep flexor tendon  (perforans) and volar flexion is inhibited by the extensor of the digit  (extensor pedis). Thus it is seen, that when the leg is a weight-bearing  member, weight is supported by the bony framework whose constituent  parts are joined together by ligaments and tendons and each one of the  several bones articulates in such manner that the joint is locked. The  articular parts of bones rest upon or against an inhibitory apparatus,  and are slightly flexed, as in the carpus, or considerably flexed such  as in the fetlock joint when weight is being supported. In the first  instance, for example, the flexors of the carpus and the superior check  ligament assisted by the flexors of the phalanges constitute the  inhibitory apparatus.    It will be noted that provision for weight bearing is so arranged that  muscular energy is not required except in the matter of suspension of  the body between the scapulae and here tonic impulses only are necessary  to maintain an equilibrium[6], yet in every instance where weight is not  supported by bones, inelastic ligaments or tendinous structures relieve  the musculature of this constant strain. This explains the fact that  some horses do not lie in the stall, yet in spite of their constant  standing position, they are able to rest and sleep.    The student of lameness is interested in the function of the legs in the  role of supporting weight and as propelling parts, and not particularly  in the capacity of these members for inflicting offense or as weapons  of defense. Yet, in the exercise of their functions other than that of  locomotive appliances, injury often results, but usually it is the  recipient of a blow that suffers the injury, such as an animal may  receive upon being kicked. Therefore, we do not often concern ourselves  with strains or other injuries that the subject experiences as the  result of efforts put forth in kicking or striking. Where such injuries  occur, however, a diagnosis is established by making use of the  principles heretofore discussed.    As propelling members the front legs bear weight and are advanced  alternately when the horse is walking or trotting--in cantering this is  not so. When the normal subject travels in a straight line, at a walk or  a trot, the length of the stride is the same with the right and left  members. The stride of the right foot then, for example, is equally  divided by the imprint of the left foot, in the normal horse, when  traveling at a walk and in a straight line.      Shoulder Lameness.    This enigmatical term is frequently employed by the diagnostician when  he is baffled in the matter of definitely locating the cause of  lameness; when he has by exclusion and otherwise arrived at a decision  that lameness is \"high up.\" Shoulder lameness may be caused by any one  or several of a number of conditions, e.g., fractures of the scapula or  humerus; arthritis of the shoulder or elbow joint; luxation of the  shoulder or elbow joint (rarely); injuries of muscles and tendons of the  region due to strains, contusions or penetrant wounds; paralysis of the  brachial plexus or of the prescapular nerve; involvement of lymph  glands; arterial thrombosis; metastatic infections; rheumatic  disturbances; and as the result of inflammation, infectious or  non-infectious occasioned by collar bruises. In some instances such  inflammation is due to the manner of treatment of collar injuries.  Therefore, when one considers the numerous and dissimilar possible  causes of shoulder lameness, it behooves the practitioner to become  proficient in diagnostic principles.    A principle which is elemental in the diagnosis of locomotory  impediment, is that lameness of the shoulder or hip is usually  manifested by more or less difficulty in swinging the affected member.  Swinging-leg-lameness, then, is usually present in shoulder affections.  In some instances lameness is mixed as in joint ailments, involvement of  the bicipital bursa (bursa intertubercularis), etc. In affections of the  extremity there exists supporting leg lameness. Consequently, we employ  this elemental principle, and, by a visual examination of the subject,  which is being made to travel suitably, one may decide that lameness is  either \"high up\"--shoulder lameness or, \"low down\"--of the extremity.    [Illustration: Fig. 5--Ordinary type of heavy sling.]    To make practical use of this principle, the examiner must be thoroughly  familiar with the anatomy of the various structures concerned in  advancing the leg--those which support weight as well as those concerned  both in weight bearing and swinging the member.      Fracture of the Scapula.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Fractures of the body of the scapula are of  infrequent occurrence in horses for the reason that protection is  afforded this bone because of its position. Its function, too, is such  that very unusual conditions are necessary to subject it to fracture.  The spine is occasionally broken due to blows such as kicks, etc., and  here frequently a compound fracture exists.    [Illustration: Fig. 6--A sling made in two parts so that horses may be  supported without use of central part or bodice. This sling is more  comfortable than is the ordinary style and is particularly useful in  cases that require a long period of this manner of confinement.]    Where fractures of the body of the scapula occur, heavy contusions have  been the cause as a rule, and serious injury is done the subject;  consequently, treatment of fracture of the body of the scapula is seldom  successfully practised. Fractures of the body of this bone resulting  from accidents not involving internal injury or other disturbances and  which would not seriously interfere with the vitality of the subject,  are not necessarily serious unless compound.    Fractures of the neck of the scapula are serious because of the fact  that there occurs displacement of the broken parts and perfect  apposition of the fractured ends is difficult, if not impossible.    Fractures that extend to the articular surface are very serious, and  complete recovery in such instances is practically impossible. The  cartilage of prolongation of the scapula is sometimes seriously involved  in certain cases of fistulous withers, and in some instances it has been  separated from its attachment to the rhomboidea muscles, and lameness  has resulted. In such instances, the upper portion of the scapula is  disjoined from all attachment, and with every movement the animal makes,  the scapula is moved back and forth. Complete recovery in such cases  does not occur.    Symptomatology.--Fractures of the scapular spine are ordinarily  readily recognized because there is usually visible displacement of the  broken part. Crepitation is also detected without"]]]
