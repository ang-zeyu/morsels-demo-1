About such a proposition I would not decide  hastily. Give me leave to think of it until to-morrow.\"    \"Most certainly.\"    [Illustration]    They now made their way to the chamber of Flora, and they heard from  George that nothing of an alarming character had occurred to disturb him  on his lonely watch. The morning was now again dawning, and Henry  earnestly entreated Mr. Marchdale to go to bed, which he did, leaving  the two brothers to continue as sentinels by Flora's bed side, until the  morning light should banish all uneasy thoughts.    Henry related to George what had taken place outside the house, and the  two brothers held a long and interesting conversation for some hours  upon that subject, as well as upon others of great importance to their  welfare. It was not until the sun's early rays came glaring in at the  casement that they both rose, and thought of awakening Flora, who had  now slept soundly for so many hours.          CHAPTER VI.    A GLANCE AT THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY.--THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE  MYSTERIOUS APPARITION'S APPEARANCE.      [Illustration]    Having thus far, we hope, interested our readers in the fortunes of a  family which had become subject to so dreadful a visitation, we trust  that a few words concerning them, and the peculiar circumstances in  which they are now placed, will not prove altogether out of place, or  unacceptable. The Bannerworth family then were well known in the part of  the country where they resided. Perhaps, if we were to say they were  better known by name than they were liked, on account of that name, we  should be near the truth, for it had unfortunately happened that for a  very considerable time past the head of the family had been the very  worst specimen of it that could be procured. While the junior branches  were frequently amiable and most intelligent, and such in mind and  manner as were calculated to inspire goodwill in all who knew them, he  who held the family property, and who resided in the house now occupied  by Flora and her brothers, was a very so--so sort of character.    This state of things, by some strange fatality, had gone on for nearly a  hundred years, and the consequence was what might have been fairly  expected, namely--that, what with their vices and what with their  extravagances, the successive heads of the Bannerworth family had  succeeded in so far diminishing the family property that, when it came  into the hands of Henry Bannerworth, it was of little value, on account  of the numerous encumbrances with which it was saddled.    The father of Henry had not been a very brilliant exception to the  general rule, as regarded the head of the family. If he were not quite  so bad as many of his ancestors, that gratifying circumstance was to be  accounted for by the supposition that he was not quite so bold, and that  the change in habits, manners, and laws, which had taken place in a  hundred years, made it not so easy for even a landed proprietor to play  the petty tyrant.    He had, to get rid of those animal spirits which had prompted many of  his predecessors to downright crimes, had recourse to the gaming-table,  and, after raising whatever sums he could upon the property which  remained, he naturally, and as might have been fully expected, lost them  all.    He was found lying dead in the garden of the house one day, and by his  side was his pocket-book, on one leaf of which, it was the impression of  the family, he had endeavoured to write something previous to his  decease, for he held a pencil firmly in his grasp.    The probability was that he had felt himself getting ill, and, being  desirous of making some communication to his family which pressed  heavily upon his mind, he had attempted to do so, but was stopped by the  too rapid approach of the hand of death.    For some days previous to his decease, his conduct had been extremely  mysterious. He had announced an intention of leaving England for  ever--of selling the house and grounds for whatever they would fetch  over and above the sums for which they were mortgaged, and so clearing  himself of all encumbrances.    He had, but a few hours before he was found lying dead, made the  following singular speech to Henry,--    \"Do not regret, Henry, that the old house which has been in our family  so long is about to be parted with. Be assured that, if it is but for  the first time in my life, I have good and substantial reasons now for  what I am about to do. We shall be able to go some other country, and  there live like princes of the land.\"    Where the means were to come from to live like a prince, unless Mr.  Bannerworth had some of the German princes in his eye, no one knew but  himself, and his sudden death buried with him that most important  secret.    There were some words written on the leaf of his pocket-book, but they  were of by far too indistinct and ambiguous a nature to lead to  anything. They were these:--    \"The money is ----------\"    And then there was a long scrawl of the pencil, which seemed to have  been occasioned by his sudden decease.    Of course nothing could be made of these words, except in the way of a  contradiction as the family lawyer said, rather more facetiously than a  man of law usually speaks, for if he had written \"The money is not,\" he  would have been somewhere remarkably near the truth.    However, with all his vices he was regretted by his children, who chose  rather to remember him in his best aspect than to dwell upon his faults.    For the first time then, within the memory of man, the head of the  family of the Bannerworths was a gentleman, in every sense of the word.  Brave, generous, highly educated, and full of many excellent and noble  qualities--for such was Henry, whom we have introduced to our readers  under such distressing circumstances.    And now, people said, that the family property having been all  dissipated and lost, there would take place a change, and that the  Bannerworths would have to take to some course of honourable industry  for a livelihood, and that then they would be as much respected as they  had before been detested and disliked.    Indeed, the position which Henry held was now a most precarious one--for  one of the amazingly clever acts of his father had been to encumber the  property with overwhelming claims, so that when Henry administered to  the estate, it was doubted almost by his attorney if it were at all  desirable to do so.    An attachment, however, to the old house of his family, had induced the  young man to hold possession of it as long as he could, despite any  adverse circumstance which might eventually be connected with it.    Some weeks, however, only after the decease of his father, and when he  fairly held possession, a sudden and a most unexpected offer came to him  from a solicitor in London, of whom he knew nothing, to purchase the  house and grounds, for a client of his, who had instructed him so to do,  but whom he did not mention.    The offer made was a liberal one, and beyond the value of the place.  The lawyer who had conducted Henry's affairs for him since his father's  decease, advised him by all means to take it; but after a consultation  with his mother and sister, and George, they all resolved to hold by  their own house as long as they could, and, consequently, he refused the  offer.    He was then asked to let the place, and to name his own price for the  occupation of it; but that he would not do: so the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],[0,"The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#12)"],[1,"that he scarcely heard  McVay. He began to guess something of the motives that led Holland to  shield this offender against the law, nor had he ever found it unwise to  yield to the whims of young millionaires.    Cecilia, who was too gentle or too politic to betray the fact that she  heard the interesting name of Picklebody for the first time, remarked in  a tone as cheerful as she could make it:    \"I suppose that if Mr. Picklebody could get in we can get out now.\"    \"Can and will,\" rejoined McVay beamingly. \"Hen comes as he has always  come to his friends, as a rescuer.\"    \"I seem to require a great deal of rescuing,\" said the girl, looking up  at the monopolist in the art who had so far said nothing.    \"Ah, but you don't understand, my dear,\" went on McVay ruthlessly  cutting into the look which the lovers were exchanging; \"You don't yet  understand how fortunate we are in our friends. Henderson did not, it is  true, come to find me. It was the greatest coincidence his meeting me  here. It seems that he and Holland are both interested in a mine in  Mexico, and what do you think?\" McVay paused and rubbed his hands;  \"Really, we have the kindest friends; they have been arranging between  them to offer me a job down there. What do you think of that?\"    Cecilia who had been trying to imagine any future after they left the  shelter of the grey stone house, would have answered if she had been  thoroughly candid that she thought Mexico was a terribly long distance  away, but she only observed:    \"How very kind of them. I am sure we shall like Mexico.\"    \"There, there, do you hear that? 'We.' Gentlemen,\" cried McVay, throwing  up his hands, \"I cannot leave my sister alone,--deserted. Consider it  all off.\"    \"Oh, I wasn't to go?\" asked Cecilia, looking up with more enthusiasm.    \"My dear,\" replied McVay, \"I must own that I was base enough to consider  a plan that would separate us. The mine, it seems, is no place for  ladies. But we will think no more about it. I see by your manner that  your feelings...\"    \"Dear Billy,\" said the girl gently, \"you must not give it up. You know  that I can always go to the Lees, until--until I get a position. And  nothing is so important as that you should have work that is  satisfactory to you. Of course you must accept.\"    \"Did you ever hear anything so noble?\" asked McVay. \"Yes, I suppose I  ought to accept. So they both tell me. I must go, mustn't I, Hen?\"    \"Well, it looks like it would be better for you if you did,\" replied the  detective, who had fortunately his legitimate share of American humour.    \"There is another point, Cecilia,\" McVay went on, \"if I do accept, I  shall have to leave at once. When did you say, Hen?\"    \"Train to New York this afternoon,--steamer sails to-morrow.\"    \"Oh, dear. That's very sudden,\" said Cecilia.    \"At a word from you, dear, I'll give it up,\" remarked McVay.    \"No, no, of course not. I should never forgive myself. You must go.  Perhaps it is all the better that I did not know beforehand. It saves me  just that amount.\"    \"We've no time to lose,\" remarked McVay briskly, \"if we are going to try  for that afternoon train. I suppose we can get a sleigh at the  gardener's, Holland, if we can struggle as far as that. Well, well, we  must hurry off.\"    It was McVay who urged on the preparations for departure, hurrying his  sister, flitting about the house at such a rate that the detective, who  was of a solider build, found it hard to keep up with.    Nor was it only physical agility that McVay required of the unfortunate  man. Having overheard Geoffrey telling him that he was not to betray the  real state of things before Miss McVay, under penalty of losing his  money, McVay took special delight in making him look like a fool,  calling upon him to remember happenings which existed only in McVay's  own fertile brain.    \"What, Hen,\" he would cry suddenly, \"was the name of that pretty black  haired girl you were so sweet on,--you know, the daughter of the  canal-boat man.\"    The detective, looking very much alarmed, would of course reply that he  did not know what McVay was talking about.    \"There, there,\" McVay would reply soothingly patting him on the  shoulder, \"I'm not going into the story of the pink blanket. You can  always trust to my discretion. But I would like just to remember her  name. It was so peculiar,--a name I never heard before.\"    The detective, who had been respectably married since he was twenty,  found himself unable to remember any female names and finally in agony  suggested \"Mary.\"    \"Mary, my dear fellow, no; that was your friend the paper-girl. There is  nothing very unusual about Mary, is there, Holland? No, the name I was  trying to think of was Ethelberta. Now you remember, don't you?\"    \"No, I don't,\" said the detective crossly, casting an appealing look at  Geoffrey.    \"How sad that is,\" said McVay philosophically. \"You don't even remember  her name, and at one time--well, well.\"    Or again, he would exclaim brightly, studying the detective's  countenance.    \"Ah, Henderson, I see the mark of Sweeney's bullet has entirely gone. I  was afraid it would leave a scar. Tell my sister that yarn. I think it  would interest her.\"    \"Yes, do, Mr. Picklebody,\" said the girl politely and McVay, when he had  sufficiently tortured his victim, would at length launch out into a  story himself. Miserable as the detective was under this sort of  treatment, it soon appeared that McVay's ease and facility had made an  impression on him, and that he looked at his prisoner with a sort of  wondering admiration.    \"Now, Holland, are we all ready? Cecilia, have you got your little bag?\"  he began when they were about to depart. \"Holland, my dear fellow, don't  think me interfering if I ask whether you have locked to all the doors  and windows? Tramps and thieves are so apt to break into shut-up houses,  and it would be such a pity if anything happened to any of your pretty  things. Ah, what an expanse of snow. Beautiful, isn't it? You may talk  about your tropical scenery, Hen, but we shan't see anything finer than  this the world over. What a contrast the south will be though, eh, old  man?\" and, drawing the detective's arm through his, leaning heavily upon  him meanwhile, McVay moved forward, talking volubly.    Cecilia and Geoffrey hesitated a moment looking up at the house that had  seen such momentous changes in their lives.    \"When we come back, it will be spring,\" said Geoffrey softly.    \"Oh,\" said the girl in rather a shaky voice, \"you like me well enough to  ask me to stay again?\"    \"Well enough,\" said Geoffrey, \"to ask you to stay forever.\""]]]
