Up to this point, an elderly Frenchman in the carriage had been  extremely offensive, from the evil odour of his Macintosh coat; but in  answer to a remark upon the improvement which the railway would effect,  by providing ventilation for the forest, he gave so much information on  that subject, and gave it so pleasantly, and had evidently so good a  knowledge of the topography of Franche Comte, that his coat speedily  lost its smell, and we became excellent friends.    It is a tantalising thing to be whirled on a hot and dusty day through  districts famous for their wines, the dust and heat standing out in  more painful colours by contrast with the recollection of cooling  draughts which other occasions have owed to such vineyards; though,  after all, the true method of facing heat with success is to drink no  wine. At any rate, the vineyards of Arbois must always be interesting,  and if the stories of the Templars' orgies be true, we may be sure  that the chapelry which they possessed in that town would be a  favourable place of residence with the order; possibly Rule XVI. might  there be somewhat relaxed. 'The good wine of Arbois,' _la meilleure  cave de Bourgougne_, a judicious old writer says, had free entry into  all the towns of the Comte; and when Burgundy was becoming imperial,  Maximilian extended this privilege through all the towns of the  empire. A hundred years later, it had so high a character, that the  troops of Henri IV. turned away from the town, announcing that they  did not wish to attack _ceulx estoient du naturel de leur vin, qui  frappe partout_;[26] and the king was forced to come himself, with his  constable and marshals, to beat down the walls, in the course of which  undertaking his men felt the vigour of the inhabitants to a greater  extent than he liked. It is said that when he had taken the town, the  municipality received him in state, and supplied him with wine of the  country. He praised the wine very highly, on which one of the body had  the ill taste to assure him that they had a better wine than that.  'You keep it, perhaps,' was the royal rebuke, 'for a better occasion.'  Henry had a great opinion of this wine; and the Duc de Sully states,  in his Memoirs, that when the Duc de Mayenne retired from the league  against the king, and came to Monceaux to tender his allegiance, Henry  punished him for past offences by walking so fast about the grounds of  the chateau, that the poor duke, what with his sciatica, and what with  his fat, at last told him with an expressive gesture that a minute  more of it would kill him. The king thereupon let him go, and promised  him some _vin d'Arbois_ to set him right again.[27]    The present appearance of the town, as seen from the high level followed  by the railway, scarcely recalls the time when Arbois was known as _le  jardin de noblesse_, and Barbarossa dated thence his charters, or Jean  Sans-peur held there the States of Burgundy. Gollut[28] tells a story of  a dowager of Arbois, mother-in-law to Philip V. and Charles IV. of  France, which outdoes legend of Bishop Hatto. Mahaut d'Artois was an  elderly lady remarkable for her charities, and was by consequence always  surrounded by large crowds of poor folk during her residence at the  Chatelaine, the ruins of which lie a mile or two from Arbois. On the  occasion of a severe famine in Burgundy, she collected a band of her  mendicant friends in a stable, and burned them all, saying that '_par  pitie elle hauoit faict cela, considerant les peines que ces pauvres  debuoient endurer en temps de si grande et tant estrange famine_.'    There is a Val d'Amour near Arbois, but the more beautiful valley of  that name lies between Dole and Besancon, and, as we passed its  neighbourhood, my friend with the Macintosh informed me that as it was  clear from my questions that I was drawing up a history of the Franche  Comte, he must beg me to insert a legend respecting the origin of this  name, Val d'Amour, which, he believed, had never appeared in print. I  disclaimed the history, but accepted the legend, and here it is:--The  Seigneur of Chissey was to marry the heiress of a neighbouring  seigneurie, and, it is needless to add, she was very lovely, and he was  handsome and brave. A lake separated the two chateaux, and the young man  not unfrequently returned by water rather late in the evening; and so it  fell out that one night he was drowned. The lady naturally grieved  sorely for her loss, and put in train all possible means for recovering  her lover's body. Time, however, passed on, and no success attended her  efforts, till at length she caused the hills which dammed up the waters  to be pierced, and then De Chissey was found. A village sprang up near  the outlet thus made, and took thence its name Percee, or, as men now  spell it, Parcey; and the rich vegetation which speedily covered the  valley, where once the lake had been, gave it such an air of happiness  and beauty, that the people remembered its origin, and called it the  Valley of Love. It is a fact that Parcy was not always so spelled, for  Noble Constantin Thiehault, Sieur de Perrecey, was a witness to the  treaty for the transference of a miraculous host from Faverney to Dole  in 1608, and old maps and books give it as Perrecey and Parrecey  indifferently. The De Chisseys, whose names may be found among the  female prebends of Chateau-Chalon, with its necessary sixteen quarters,  filled a considerable place in the history of the Comte from the  Crusades downwards, and known as _les Fols de Chissey_, the brave[29]  and dashing, and witty De Chisseys--qualities which no doubt were  possessed by the poor young man for whom the fair Chatelaine drained the  Val d'Amour.    As we drew nearer to Besancon, each turn of the small streams, and each  low rounded hill, might have served as an illustration to Caesar's  'Commentaries.' Now at length it was seen how, whatever the result of a  battle, there was always a _proximus collis_ for the conquered party to  retire to; and it would have been easy to find many suitable scenes for  the critical engagement, where the woods sloped down to a strip of  grass-land between their foot and the stream.    The Frenchman knew his Caesar, but he put that general in the fourth  century B.C. He made mistakes, too, in quoting him, which were easily  detected by a memory bristling with the details of his phraseology, the  indelible result of extracting the principal parts of his verbs, and the  nominatives of his irregular nouns, from half a dozen generations of  small boys. He promised me a rich Julian feast in Besancon, and was  greatly affected when he found that the Englishman could give him  Caesar's description of his native town. He wholly denied the  amphitheatre with which one of our handbooks has gifted it; and this  denial was afterwards echoed by every one in Besancon, some even  thinking it necessary to explain the difference between an amphitheatre  and an arch of triumph, the latter still existing in the town. The  Jesuit Dunod relates that the amphitheatre was to be seen at the  beginning of the seventeenth century, in the ruined state in which the  Alans and Vandals had left it after their successful siege in 406. It  seems to have stood near the present site of the Madeleine.    It was a great satisfaction to find that the Frenchman had himself  visited the glaciere which was the object of my search, and was able to  give some idea as to the manner of reaching it, for my information on  the subject was confined to a vague notice that there was an ice-cave  five leagues from Besancon. As so often happened in other cases, he  advised me not to go to it, but rather, if I must see a cave, to go to  the Grotto of Ocelles,[30] a collection of thirty or more caverns and  galleries near the Doubs, below Besancon. Seeing, however, that I was  bent on visiting the glaciere, he advised me not to go on Sunday, for  the Cardinal Archbishop had ordered the Trappists at the Chartreuse near  not to receive guests on that day; while Saturday, he thought, was  almost as bad, for nothing better than an omelette could be obtained on  days of abstinence. Saturday, then, was clearly the day to be chosen.    The first sight of Besancon explains at once why Caesar was so anxious  to forestall Ariovistus by occupying Vesontio, although the hill on  which the citadel stands is not so striking as the similar hill at  Salins, and the engines of modern warfare would promptly print their  telegrams on every stone and man in the place, from the neighbouring  heights. The French Government has wisely taken warning from the  bombardment by the Allies, and has covered the heights which command it  on either side with friendly fortifications, in which lie the keys of  the place. Historically, Besancon is a place of great interest. It  witnessed the catastrophe of Julius Vindex, who had made terms with  Rufus, the general sent against him by Nero, but was attacked by the  troops of Rufus before they learned the alliance concluded between the  two generals. Vindex was so much grieved by the slaughter of his troops,  and the blow thus struck, by an unhappy accident, at his designs against  the emperor, that he put himself to death at the gates of the town,  while the fight was still going on.[31] The Bisuntians claim to  themselves the glory acquired by the Sequani, whose chief city Vesontio  was, by the overthrow of Julius Sabinus, who asserted that he was the  grandson of a son of Julius Caesar, and proclaimed himself emperor in  the time of Vespasian. The Sequani proceeded against him of their own  accord, and conquered him in the interest of the reigning emperor; and  he and his wife Peponilla lived hid in a tomb for nine years. Here two  sons were born to them; and when they were all discovered and carried to  Rome, Peponilla prettily told the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#12)"],[1," girls, and campaigned it not without  honor; but now this wall, which guards the left side of [the statue] of  sea-born Venus, shall have my arms and my lyre discharged from warfare.  Here, here, deposit the shining flambeaux, and the wrenching irons, and  the bows, that threatened the resisting doors. O thou goddess, who  possessest the blissful Cyprus, and Memphis free from Sithonian snow, O  queen, give the haughty Chloe one cut with your high-raised lash.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XXVII.    TO GALATEA, UPON HER GOING TO SEA.      Let the omen of the noisy screech-owl and a pregnant bitch, or a tawny  wolf running down from the Lanuvian fields, or a fox with whelp conduct  the impious [on their way]; may the serpent also break their undertaken  journey, if, like an arrow athwart the road, it has frightened the  horses. What shall I, a provident augur, fear? I will invoke from the  east, with my prayers, the raven forboding by his croaking, before the  bird which presages impending showers, revisits the stagnant pools.  Mayest thou be happy, O Galatea, wheresoever thou choosest to reside,  and live mindful of me and neither the unlucky pye nor the vagrant crow  forbids your going on. But you see, with what an uproar the prone Orion  hastens on: I know what the dark bay of the Adriatic is, and in what  manner Iapyx, [seemingly] serene, is guilty. Let the wives and children  of our enemies feel the blind tumults of the rising south, and the  roaring of the blackened sea, and the shores trembling with its lash.  Thus too Europa trusted her fair side to the deceitful bull, and bold as  she was, turned pale at the sea abounding with monsters, and the cheat  now become manifest. She, who lately in the meadows was busied about  flowers, and a composer of the chaplet meet for nymphs, saw nothing in  the dusky night put stars and water. Who as soon as she arrived at  Crete, powerful with its hundred cities, cried out, overcome with rage,  \"O father, name abandoned by thy daughter! O my duty! Whence, whither am  I come? One death is too little for virgins' crime. Am I awake, while I  deplore my base offense; or does some vain phantom, which, escaping from  the ivory gate, brings on a dream, impose upon me, still free from  guilt. Was it better to travel over the tedious waves, or to gather the  fresh flowers? If any one now would deliver up to me in my anger this  infamous bull, I would do my utmost to tear him to pieces with steel,  and break off the horns of the monster, lately so much beloved.  Abandoned I have left my father's house, abandoned I procrastinate my  doom. O if any of the gods hear this, I wish I may wander naked among  lions: before foul decay seizes my comely cheeks, and moisture leaves  this tender prey, I desire, in all my beauty, to be the food of tigers.\"  \"Base Europa,\" thy absent father urges, \"why do you hesitate to die? you  may strangle your neck suspended from this ash, with your girdle that  has commodiously attended you. Or if a precipice, and the rocks that are  edged with death, please you, come on, commit yourself to the rapid  storm; unless you, that are of blood-royal, had rather card your  mistress's wool, and be given up as a concubine to some barbarian dame.\"  As she complained, the treacherously-smiling Venus, and her son, with  his bow relaxed, drew near. Presently, when she had sufficiently rallied  her, \"Refrain (she cried) from your rage and passionate chidings, since  this detested bull shall surrender his horns to be torn in pieces by  you. Are you ignorant, that you are the wife of the invincible Jove?  Cease your sobbing; learn duly to support your distinguished good  fortune. A division of the world shall bear your name.\"           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XXVIII.    TO LYDE.      What can I do better on the festal day of Neptune? Quickly produce,  Lyde, the hoarded Caecuban, and make an attack upon wisdom, ever on her  guard. You perceive the noontide is on its decline; and yet, as if the  fleeting day stood still, you delay to bring out of the store-house the  loitering cask, [that bears its date] from the consul Bibulus. We will  sing by turns, Neptune, and the green locks of the Nereids; you, shall  chant, on your wreathed lyre, Latona and the darts of the nimble  Cynthia; at the conclusion of your song, she also [shall be celebrated],  who with her yoked swans visits Gnidos, and the shining Cyclades, and  Paphos: the night also shall be celebrated in a suitable lay.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XXIX.    TO MAECENAS.      O Maecenas, thou progeny of Tuscan kings, there has been a long while  for you in my house some mellow wine in an unbroached hogshead, with  rose-flowers and expressed essence for your hair. Disengage yourself  from anything that may retard you, nor contemplate the ever marshy  Tibur, and the sloping fields of Aesula, and the hills of Telegonus the  parricide. Leave abundance, which is the source of daintiness, and yon  pile of buildings approaching near the lofty clouds: cease to admire the  smoke, and opulence, and noise of flourishing Rome. A change is  frequently agreeable to the rich, and a cleanly meal in the little  cottage of the poor has smoothed an anxious brow without carpets or  purple. Now the bright father of Andromeda displays his hidden fire; now  Procyon rages, and the constellation of the ravening Lion, as the sun  brings round the thirsty season. Now the weary shepherd with his languid  flock seeks the shade, and the river, and the thickets of rough  Sylvanus; and the silent bank is free from the wandering winds. You  regard what constitution may suit the state, and are in an anxious dread  for Rome, what preparations the Seres and the Bactrians subject to  Cyrus, and the factious Tanais are making. A wise deity shrouds in  obscure darkness the events of the time to come, and smiles if a mortal  is solicitous beyond the law of nature. Be mindful to manage duly that  which is present. What remains goes on in the manner of the river, at  one time calmly gliding in the middle of its channel to the Tuscan Sea,  at another, rolling along corroded stones, and stumps of trees, forced  away, and cattle, and houses, not without the noise of mountains and  neighboring woods, when the merciless deluge enrages the peaceful  waters. That man is master of himself and shall live happy, who has it  in his power to say, \"I have lived to-day: to-morrow let the Sire invest  the heaven, either with a black cloud, or with clear sunshine;  nevertheless, he shall not render ineffectual what is past, nor undo or  annihilate what the fleeting hour has once carried off. Fortune, happy  in the execution of her cruel office, and persisting to play her  insolent game, changes uncertain honors, indulgent now to me, by and by  to another. I praise her, while she abides by me. If she moves her fleet  wings, I resign what she has bestowed, and wrap myself up in my virtue,  and court honest poverty without a portion. It is no business of mine,  if the mast groan with the African storms, to have recourse to piteous  prayers, and to make a bargain with my vows, that my Cyprian and Syrian  merchandize may not add to the wealth of the insatiable sea. Then the  gale and the twin Pollux will carry me safe in the protection of a skiff  with two oars, through the tumultuous Aegean Sea.\"           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XXX.    ON HIS OWN WORKS.      I have completed a monument more lasting than brass, and more sublime  than the regal elevation of pyramids, which neither the wasting shower,  the unavailing north wind, nor an innumerable succession of years, and  the flight of seasons, shall be able to demolish. I shall not wholly  die; but a great part of me shall escape Libitina. I shall continualy be  renewed in the praises of posterity, as long as the priest shall ascend  the Capitol with the silent [vestal] virgin. Where the rapid Aufidus  shall murmur, and where Daunus, poorly supplied with water, ruled over a  rustic people, I, exalted from a low degree, shall be acknowledged as  having originally adapted the Aeolic verse to Italian measures.  Melpomene, assume that pride which your merits have acquired, and  willingly crown my hair with the Delphic laurel.           *       *       *       *       *          THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE ODES OF HORACE.        ODE I.    TO VENUS.      After a long cessation, O Venus, again are you stirring up tumults?  Spare me, I beseech you, I beseech you. I am not the man I was under the  dominion of good-natured Cynara. Forbear, O cruel mother of soft  desires, to bend one bordering upon fifty, now too hardened for soft  commands: go, whither the soothing prayers of youths, invoke you. More  seasonably may you revel in the house of Paulus Maximus, flying thither  with your splendid swans, if you seek to inflame a suitable breast. For  he is both noble and comely, and by no means silent in the cause of  distressed defendants, and a youth of a hundred accomplishments; he  shall bear the ensigns of your warfare far and wide; and whenever, more  prevailing than the ample presents of a rival, he shall laugh [at his  expense], he shall erect thee in marble under a citron dome near the  Alban lake. There you shall smell abundant frankincense, and shall be  charmed with the mixed music of the lyre and Berecynthian pipe, not  without the flageolet. There the youths, together with the tender  maidens, twice a day celebrating your divinity, shall, Salian-like, with  white foot thrice shake the ground. As for me, neither woman, nor youth,  nor the fond hopes of mutual inclination, nor to contend in wine, nor to  bind my temples with fresh flowers, delight me [any longer]. But why;  ah! why, Ligurinus, does the tear every now and then trickle down my  cheeks? Why does my fluent tongue falter between my words with an  unseemly silence? Thee in my"]]]
