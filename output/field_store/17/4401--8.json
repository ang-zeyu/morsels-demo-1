Note how the chief characters are emphasized. Can you  discover the quality called \"restraint,\" in this fragment of a play? How  is it gained, and what is its value?      EXERCISES[8]    Select a short passage from some book that you like, and try to put it  into dramatic form, using this selection as a kind of model. Do not  attempt too much at once, but think out carefully the setting, the stage  directions, and the dialogue for a brief fragment of a play.    Make a series of dramatic scenes from the same book, so that a connected  story is worked out.    Read a part of some modern drama, such as _The Piper_, or _The Blue  Bird_, or one of Mr. Howells's little farces, and notice how it makes  use of setting and stage directions; how the conversation is broken up;  how the situation is brought out in the dialogue; how each person is  made to speak in his own character.    After you have done the reading suggested above, make another attempt at  dramatizing a scene from a book, and see what improvement you can make  upon the sort of thing you did at first.    It might be interesting for two or three persons to work on a bit of  dramatization together, and then give the fragment of a play in simple  fashion before the class. Or the whole class may work on the play, and  then select some of their number to perform it.

The grave had received that which it was to hold until the crack  of doom, and was now being rapidly filled with sand. The crew of  deep-dyed villains worked or stood or sat in silence, but all looked at  the grave, and saw me not. As the last handful of sand made it level  with the beach, I walked into their midst, and found myself face to face  with the three candidates for the now vacant captaincy.    \"Give you good-day, gentlemen,\" I cried. \"Is it your captain that you  bury or one of your crew, or is it only pezos and pieces of eight?    \"The sun shining on so much bare steel hurts my eyes,\" I said. \"Put up,  gentlemen, put up! Cannot one rover attend the funeral of another  without all this crowding and display of cutlery? If you will take the  trouble to look around you, you will see that I have brought to the  obsequies only myself.\"    One by one cutlass and sword were lowered, and those who had drawn them,  falling somewhat back, spat and swore and laughed. The man in black and  silver only smiled gently and sadly. \"Did you drop from the blue?\" he  asked. \"Or did you come up from the sea?\"    \"I came out of it,\" I said. \"My ship went down in the storm yesterday.  Your little cockboat yonder was more fortunate.\" I waved my hand toward  that ship of three hundred tons, then twirled my mustaches and stood at  gaze.    \"Was your ship so large, then?\" demanded Paradise, while a murmur of  admiration, larded with oaths, ran around the circle.    \"She was a very great galleon,\" I replied, with a sigh for the good ship  that was gone.    A moment's silence, during which they all looked at me. \"A galleon,\"  then said Paradise softly.    \"They that sailed her yesterday are to-day at the bottom of the sea,\" I  continued. \"Alackaday! so are one hundred thousand pezos of gold, three  thousand bars of silver, ten frails of pearls, jewels uncounted, cloth  of gold and cloth of silver. She was a very rich prize.\"    The circle sucked in their breath. \"All at the bottom of the sea?\"  queried Red Gil, with gloating eyes fixed upon the smiling water. \"Not  one pezo left, not one little, little pearl?\"    I shook my head and heaved a prodigious sigh. \"The treasure is gone,\" I  said, \"and the men with whom I took it are gone. I am a captain with  neither ship nor crew. I take you, my friends, for a ship and crew  without a captain. The inference is obvious.\"    The ring gaped with wonder, then strange oaths arose. Red Gil broke into  a bellow of angry laughter, while the Spaniard glared like a catamount  about to spring. \"So you would be our captain?\" said Paradise, picking  up another shell, and poising it upon a hand as fine and small as a  woman's.    \"Faith, you might go farther and fare worse,\" I answered, and began to  hum a tune. When I had finished it, \"I am Kirby,\" I said, and waited to  see if that shot should go wide or through the hull.    For two minutes the dash of the surf and the cries of the wheeling sea  fowl made the only sound in that part of the world; then from those  half-clad rapscallions arose a shout of \"Kirby!\"--a shout in which the  three leaders did not join. That one who looked a gentleman rose from  the sand and made me a low bow. \"Well met, noble captain,\" he cried in  those his honey tones. \"You will doubtless remember me who was with you  that time at Maracaibo when you sunk the galleasses. Five years have  passed since then, and yet I see you ten years younger and three inches  taller.\"    \"I touched once at the Lucayas, and found the spring de Leon sought,\" I  said. \"Sure the waters have a marvelous effect, and if they give not  eternal youth at least renew that which we have lost.\"    \"Truly a potent aqua vitae,\" he remarked, still with thoughtful  melancholy. \"I see that it hath changed your eyes from black to gray.\"    \"It hath that peculiar virtue,\" I said, \"that it can make black seem  white.\"    The man with the woman's mantle drawn about him now thrust himself from  the rear to the front rank. \"That's not Kirby!\" he bawled. \"He's no more  Kirby than I am Kirby! Didn't I sail with Kirby from the Summer Isles to  Cartagena and back again? He's a cheat, and I am a-going to cut his  heart out!\" He was making at me with a long knife, when I whipped out my  rapier.    \"Am I not Kirby, you dog?\" I cried, and ran him through the shoulder.    He dropped, and his fellows surged forward with a yell. \"Yet a little  patience, my masters!\" said Paradise in a raised voice and with genuine  amusement in his eyes. \"It is true that that Kirby with whom I and our  friend there on the ground sailed was somewhat short and as swart as a  raven, besides having a cut across his face that had taken away part of  his lip and the top of his ear, and that this gentleman who announces  himself as Kirby hath none of Kirby's marks. But we are fair and  generous and open to conviction\"--    \"He'll have to convince my cutlass!\" roared Red Gil.    I turned upon him. \"If I do convince it, what then?\" I demanded. \"If I  convince your sword, you of Spain, and yours, Sir Black and Silver?\"    The Spaniard stared. \"I was the best sword in Lima,\" he said stiffly. \"I  and my Toledo will not change our minds.\"    \"Let him try to convince Paradise; he's got no reputation as a  swordsman!\" cried out the grave-digger with the broken head.    A roar of laughter followed this suggestion, and I gathered from it and  from the oaths and allusions to this or that time and place that  Paradise was not without reputation.    I turned to him. \"If I fight you three, one by one, and win, am I  Kirby?\"    He regarded the shell with which he was toying with a thoughtful smile,  held it up that the light might strike through its rose and pearl, then  crushed it to dust between his fingers.    \"Ay,\" he said with an oath. \"If you win against the cutlass of Red Gil,  the best blade of Lima, and the sword of Paradise, you may call yourself  the devil an you please, and we will all subscribe to it.\"    I lifted my hand. \"I am to have fair play?\"    As one man that crew of desperate villains swore that the odds"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17164"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#12)"],[1," some being as fair as those on  the coast, whilst others are as black as the darkest negroes of Central  Africa. The Sheikh and two or three patriarchs of the village were  polite and hospitable, and showed every disposition to comply with the  orders sent by the Pasha of Mourzuk to supply us with fresh provisions  without payment. I accepted a sheep and two fowls; but the dates for our  blacks I paid for, and added a few presents.    The valley of Edree is very shallow, and this portion of it is mostly  covered with bushes of wild palm and with coarse herbage; it looks green  and grateful amidst the surrounding aridity. There are still remaining  many fruit-bearing date-trees--about seven thousand, scattered at great  distances. The water is good, although the surface of the valley is in  parts covered with a whitish crust of salt. Some large springs are  continually overflowing with bubbles of gas, like the great well of  Ghadamez.    In the garden-fields of Edree are cultivated wheat and barley, the  former white and of the finest quality. A good deal of grain has already  been got in this year. With industry, and a few more animals to draw the  water for irrigation, a great quantity of wheat might be grown in this  oasis. The gardens contain also a few figs and grapes. Doves were  fluttering in the branches of the palms, and swallows darting through  their waving foliage. There were thousands of native flies here, besides  those that had come with us. When we complained, we were answered, \"This  is a country of dates!\"    Shaty has eighteen districts, some very limited, but having date-palms,  and paying contributions to Mourzuk. Edree, itself, is drained of four  hundred mahboubs per annum.    _27th._--I rose at sunrise and went to see the ancient dwellings of  Edree, where the people lived underground: they are excavations out of  the rock, some fifty yards from the surface beneath the modern town. The  entrances are choked with sand, and they are not entered by the people,  who say \"They are the abodes of serpents.\" At present, there is nothing  remarkable about them. Probably they were originally natural caves,  which were enlarged and arranged as dwellings.    On returning to the encampment, I found that the Kaid, or commander of  the troops of the Shaty district, had arrived with some Arab cavaliers:  he has in all thirty horsemen. Our visitors offered to \"play powder\" in  order to do us honour; but were compelled to beg us to supply the  ammunition. It was a very animating scene, after the dreary journey over  the Fezzanee deserts. A dozen mounted cavaliers dashed to and fro,  shaking the earth, scouting and firing from time to time. Everybody  enjoyed it; even the half-naked, dirty, brown-black ladies of the town,  stopped with their water-jugs, and looked on with satisfaction. The Kaid  was the best man of his men; but Yusuf afterwards dressed and beat the  victor, riding with great dexterity, and attracting the spontaneous  applause of all the spectators. The Kaid trembled whilst contending with  Yusuf, who was set down as a marabout in consequence by our chaouch.    I gave the Kaid, who was a mild and respectful man, a handkerchief, a  little bit of writing-paper, and some soap, and sent him off to his  station, whence he had come on purpose to visit us. Three handkerchiefs  formed also an appropriate present to the Sheikhs of Edree.    Yusuf has been reading an Arabic book, which I at first thought was some  commentary on the Koran; but to-day I was undeceived. He related what he  read; it reminded me of Gulliver's Travels. A tall man walks through the  sea, cooks fish in the sun, and destroys a whole town, whose inhabitants  had insulted him, by the same means that our comparative giant saved the  palace of Lilliput from conflagration.    This evening it was announced as an event that the Zintanah, a servant  of the Germans, was going to Tripoli, having resolved to return home.  Some said one thing about him, some another; but most, \"He's afraid of  the fever of Mourzuk.\" The fellow came afterwards to me, asking for  letters to Tripoli. I told him to go about his business; that he was a  man of words and had no heart, otherwise he would continue with us to  Mourzuk. I wished to discourage such acts of desertion, for they produce  always a bad effect. My German companions seemed glad to get rid of him.    We started again on Sunday morning (the 28th). This was our first day of  sand. We had almost forgotten that there was such a thing as sand in the  desert; but we shall have two days more of the same kind of travelling,  to keep us in mind of this unpleasant truth. However, we were glad  enough to leave Edree. Our marabout, comparing this place with El-Wady,  for which we are now journeying, says, \"Edree is like a jackass; El-Wady  is like a camel!\" Yusuf calls Edree \"the city of camel-bugs.\" These  vermin are the leeches of the camels. During the morning we passed two  or three forests of palms, and afterwards traversed a flat valley, where  was a little herbage. The people said; \"There is no tareek (track): the  tareek is in our heads.\" Bou Keta noted the route in many parts by the  presence of camels' dung; but the shape of the sand-hills in these parts  seems to be perfectly familiar to these men. We saw one or two lizards,  but no birds or other signs of life, except two brown-black Fezzanees,  trudging over the desert.    At four in the afternoon, after a day of hot wind, we encamped in Wady  Guber, where there is water two or three feet below the surface; and a  small forest of palms belonging to our camel-drivers, having descended  to them in small groups from their grandfathers.    Next day (29th) we again went on over the sand, which extends beyond  Ghadamez and Souf, to the west, and even to Egypt on the east. It is met  at different points by the khafilahs, and crossed in different numbers  of days. We found it very hard work to cross it, and understood why, in  these parts, the words _raml_, sand, and _war_, difficult, have become  convertible terms. Bou Keta had considerable trouble in keeping to the  route, being reduced to depend chiefly on the camels' dung, which rolls  about the surface of the sand. Here and there was a patch of coarse  herbage, scattered like black spots on the bright, white surface. Every  object was very much magnified at a little distance; I saw what seemed  to me to be a horse on the top of one of the hills, but on drawing near  it proved to be our own greyhound bitch smelling the hot air.    Bou Keta gave some account of himself to-day. It seems that \"Fezzanee\"  is not a very respectable epithet in those countries.    \"I am not a Fezzanee,\" said Bou Keta, abruptly.    \"Then what are you?\"    \"My mother was a Tuarick woman, and my father one of the Walad  Suleiman.\"    \"Then the Walad Suleiman are gentlemen, whilst the Fezzanees are Turks  and dogs?\"    \"That's the truth,\" quoth he.    To-day I found the veil of my sister-in-law of essential service.  Doubled, it shielded my eyes perfectly from the hot wind and sand. It  serves also as an excellent protection for the eyes against the flies  whilst I am writing. This is the second day of the hot wind. In the  evening we heard crickets singing in the scorching sand. At mid-day the  thermometer, when buried, rose to 122 deg. Fahr. We encamped in Wady  El-Makmak, where we had good water, far superior to that at Guber. As in  nearly all sandy places, a hole is scooped in the sand and then covered  over, or left to be filled by the action of the wind after the khafilah  is supplied. Two pretty palms point, as with two fingers, to the buried  wells of El-Makmak.    Some of our people noticed the lizard to-day. This seems to be the  omnipresent animal of the Sahara, inhabiting its most desolate regions  when no other living creature is seen. It changes in species with the  nature of the country. To-day, those seen are large; very soon they will  become small, meagre, and will change colour. In the valleys I have  observed them nearly the same colour as the sandy soil. Perhaps the  beetle is nearly as common as the lizard in the desert, being found in  its most arid and naked wastes. It is generally a big, round,  black-bottle beetle, which produces a trail in the sand that may be  mistaken for that of the serpent.    Still the following day we had to cross the same kind of desert, under  the enervating influence of the gheblee, or hot wind; the thermometer in  the sand reached 130 deg.. Although the camels were eight hours on foot,  little progress was made. I stopped an hour to rest in Wady El-Jumar,  where were two or three palm-groves. One of the Fezzanees ferreted out a  lot of dates, hidden in the sand, and taking some distributed them  amongst us.    Thus refreshed we pushed on to encamp in Wady El-Takadafah, where there  is a well of water, good to drink, but disagreeable in smell, like that  of Bonjem. The odour resembles that of a sewer, and is produced by  hydrogen of sulphur. We have had good water every day in this sandy  tract, and I have no doubt that some may be found in every wady, a  little below the surface. Birds begin now to reappear: a few swallows, a  dove, and some small twitterers, were seen to give life to the otherwise  melancholy wadys.    Dr. Overweg examined the sand, which rolled in great heaps on every  side, and found it to consist of grains of four kinds,--white, yellow,  red, and black; the latter colour caused by the presence of iron. These  variegated sands form the basis of sandstone, and may be a decomposition  of sandstone. The sand near Tripoli is of a finer sort, consisting  mostly of a decomposition of limestone. There is a blue-black earth in  the wadys, arising from the wood, a species of crumbling coal.    This evening we had a famous _embroglio_ between our chaouch and the  marabout. The latter had caught a waran, or large species of lizard, and  skinned it to"]]]
