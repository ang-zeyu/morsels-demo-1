Can't you imagine that I may prefer to talk to Mm for a little  rather than to any one else, even if only with pen, ink and paper?\" she  added, with a charming blush and smile.    \"Oh, yes, indeed! for I know you're very fond of him. And I don't wonder,  for I think he's the very best and handsomest man in the world,\" cried Max  enthusiastically, and both Lulu and Gracie said, \"So do I.\"    \"Then we are all agreed so far,\" laughed Vi. \"Come, Gracie, darling, I  will be your maid to-night.\"    \"No, no! not my maid, but my dear, sweet, pretty mamma!\" returned the  little one, throwing her arms around Violet's neck and kissing her with  ardent affection.    Lulu had risen to go for her books, but paused to say with a slight effort  and heightened color, \"Yes, Mamma Vi, you are sweet and pretty, and very,  very kind to us.\"    The child was by no means devoid of gratitude, though her pride and  prejudice were hard to conquer. Expressions of gratitude and affection  toward their young stepmother were far less frequent from her than from  her brother and sister, but were perhaps all the more valued because of  their rarity.    \"Thank you, dear,\" returned Violet, happy tears glistening in her eyes;  \"if I am, it is because I love you for both your own and your father's  sake.\"    She knew his heart always rejoiced in every demonstration of affection  from his children toward her, and in the letter she presently began  writing she recounted all that had been shown her that evening, and also  others carefully treasured up in her memory for that purpose.          CHAPTER IX.        \"The sober comfort, all the peace which springs       From the large aggregate of little things,       On these small cares of--daughter--wife--or friend,       The almost sacred joys of home depend.\"                                   --Hannah More.      Mrs. Elsie Travilla and her family were greatly beloved in their own  neighborhood, and as there had been no opportunity hitherto for showing  attention to the three young married ladies, or any one of them, there was  quite an influx of callers for a week or two after the return to Ion, and  these calls were presently succeeded by a round of dinner and evening  parties given in their honor.    The death of Mr. Love having occurred within the year, Zoe, of course,  declined all such invitations; and it was only occasionally that Edward  could be persuaded to go without her.    Violet accepted when it would have been deemed impolite or unkind to  decline, but scarcely yet more than a bride, she felt a trifle forlorn  going into society without her husband, and much preferred the quiet and  seclusion of home.    This was to the advantage of the children, Max and Lulu thereby gaining  much assistance with their evening studies, Gracie a great deal of  motherly care and petting.    So the duty of representing the family at these social gatherings devolved  largely upon Lester and Elsie Leland, who laughingly declared themselves  martyrs to the social reputation of the family.    \"A very nice way to be martyred, I think,\" said Rosie. \"I only wish they'd  have the politeness to include me in their invitations.\"    \"It would do you little good,\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore, \"since you would not  be allowed to accept.\"    \"Are you quite sure, grandpa, that mamma wouldn't allow it?\" she asked,  with an arch look up into his face.    \"Quite; since she never allows anything which I do not approve.\"    \"Well,\" Rosie said, seating herself upon his knee and putting an arm  around his neck, \"I believe it isn't worth while to fret about it, since,  as I'm not invited, I couldn't go any how.\"    \"A sensible conclusion,\" he returned laughingly. \"Fretting is an  unprofitable business at any time.\"    \"Ordinarily I should be very much of Rosie's opinion,\" Zoe said aside to  her husband, \"for I was always fond of parties; but of course, just now I  couldn't take the least pleasure in them,\" and she hastily brushed away a  tear.    \"No, love, I'm sure you could not,\" he said, tenderly clasping the little  hand she had laid in his. \"But the truest, purest happiness is found at  home. And,\" he added with a smile, \"it is quite to the advantage of your  plans for study that society can claim so little of your time and strength  at present. You are doing so nicely that I am very proud of my pupil.\"    She flushed with pleasure, but with a roguish smile, and shaking her  finger warningly at him, \"Take care,\" she said, \"don't let the husband be  lost in the tutor, or I shall----\"    \"What? go over to grandpa?\"    \"Oh, no, no!\" she cried, snatching her hand from his grasp, and lifting  both in mimic horror.    \"What are you two chatting so cosily about in that far-off corner?\" asked  Mrs. Leland's cheery voice from the midst of the larger group at the  farther side of the room.    \"It's merely a little private confab between man and wife, in which the  public can have no interest,\" returned Edward.    \"Quite a mistake, so far as this part of the public is concerned,\" said  his mother, her soft brown eyes gazing lovingly upon them, \"but we won't  pry into your secrets, only invite you to join our circle when you have  finished your private chat.\"    For some weeks all went well with our friends at Ion; the family machinery  worked smoothly, with no jarring or jostling; everybody in good humor and  behaving kindly toward everybody else.    Max and Lulu made good progress in their studies, and were able to give a  good report of each day in their diaries, which, of their own accord, they  brought each evening to Violet for her inspection.    She reminded them that they were not required to do so; but they answered  that they preferred it; they wanted to know if she thought they were  representing themselves as better than they really were.    She was glad to be able to answer with truth that she did not think so,  and that she could report them to their father as worthy of all praise in  regard to both conduct and diligence in study.    \"You have both been so pleasant tempered,\" she remarked in conclusion,  \"Lulu neither grumbling nor so much as looking sour over her tasks, or  even the sewing lessons, which I know are particularly distasteful to her.  Dear child, you have been very good, and I know it will rejoice your  father's heart to hear it,\" she added, kissing the little girl's cheek.    Lulu's face flushed and her eyes shone, Mrs. Scrimp had been always ready  to blame, never to praise, but with Mamma Vi it was just the other way.  She was almost blind to faults, but particularly keen-sighted where  virtues were concerned.    Violet turned toward Max to find him regarding her with wistful, longing  looks.    \"Well, what is it, Max, my dear boy?\" she asked, half laughingly.    \"Don't be partial, Mamma Vi,\" he answered. \"I do believe a boy likes a  kiss from a sweet, pretty lady that he has a right to care for, quite as  well as a girl does.\"    \"Then come and get it,\" she said, offering her lips. \"Max, you may feel as  free always to ask for it as if I were your own mother or sister.\"    Edward had, perhaps, the most trying pupil of all; she had done well at  first, but as the novelty of the undertaking wore off, lost her interest,  and now found so many excuses for not being prepared at the proper time  for recitation; and if he so much as looked grave over the failure, was so  hurt, and felt herself so ill-used, that an extra amount of coaxing and  petting became necessary to restore her to cheerfulness and good humor.    He was growing very weary of it all, and at times felt tempted to cease  trying to improve the mind of his little wife; but no, he could not do  that if he would have her a fit companion for him intellectually as well  as in other respects, for though she had naturally a fine mind, its  cultivation had been sadly neglected.    He opened his heart to his mother on the subject, entreating her advice  and assistance, but without finding fault with Zoe (Elsie would hardly  have listened for a moment to that), and she comforted him with words of  encouragement to persevere in his own efforts, and promises to aid him in  every way in her power.    In pursuance of that object she put in Zoe's way, and recommended to her  notice, books that would be likely to interest and at the same time  instruct her. Also considered her needs, as well as those of her own  pupils, in making her selections for the afternoon readings in the  school-room.    There was much gained by the child wife in these ways, and also from the  conversation of the highly educated and intelligent older members of the  family, of which she had now become a part.    She was very desirous to become their equal in these respects, especially  for Edward's sake, but she was so much used to self-indulgence, so  unaccustomed to self-control, that her good resolutions were made only to  be broken till she herself was nearly ready to give up in despair.    Elsie was alone in her own apartments one afternoon, an hour or more after  dismissing her pupils to their play, when Zoe came to her with flushed  cheeks, quivering lips, and eyes full of tears.    \"What is wrong with you, my dear little daughter?\" Elsie asked in tender,  motherly tones, as she looked up into the troubled face.    \"O mamma, I don't know what to do! I wish you could help me!\" cried Zoe,  dropping upon her knees at Elsie's feet, and hiding her face on her lap,  the tears falling fast now, mingled with sobs.    \"Only tell me what is wrong, dear, and you shall have all the help I can  give,\" Elsie said, smoothing the weeper's fair hair with soft, caressing  hand.    \"Edward is vexed with me,\" sobbed Zoe. \"I know he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#12)"],[1,"mother,  who went and purchased provisions enough to last them some time. After  this manner they lived, till Aladdin had sold the twelve dishes singly,  as necessity pressed, to the Jew, for the same money; who, after the  first time, durst not offer him less, for fear of losing so good a  bargain. When he had sold the last dish, he had recourse to the tray,  which weighed ten times as much as the dishes, and would have carried it  to his old purchaser, but that it was too large and cumbersome;  therefore he was obliged to bring him home with him to his mother's,  where, after the Jew had examined the weight of the tray, he laid down  ten pieces of gold, with which Aladdin was very well satisfied.    When all the money was spent, Aladdin had recourse again to the lamp. He  took it in his hands, looked for the part where his mother had rubbed it  with the sand, rubbed it also, when the genie immediately appeared, and  said, \"What wouldst thou have? I am ready to obey thee as thy slave, and  the slave of all those who have that lamp in their hands; I, and the  other slaves of the lamp.\" \"I am hungry,\" said Aladdin, \"bring me  something to eat.\" The genie disappeared, and presently returned with a  tray, the same number of covered dishes as before, set them down, and  vanished.    As soon as Aladdin found that their provisions were again expended, he  took one of the dishes, and went to look for his Jew chapman; but  passing by a goldsmith's shop, the goldsmith perceiving him, called to  him, and said, \"My lad, I imagine that you have something to sell to the  Jew, whom I often see you visit; but perhaps you do not know that he is  the greatest rogue even among the Jews. I will give you the full worth  of what you have to sell, or I will direct you to other merchants who  will not cheat you.\"    This offer induced Aladdin to pull his plate from tinder his vest and  show it to the goldsmith; who at first sight saw that it was made of the  finest silver, and asked him if he had sold such as that to the Jew;  when Aladdin told him that he had sold him twelve such, for a piece of  gold each. \"What a villain!\" cried the goldsmith. \"But,\" added he, \"my  son, what is past cannot be recalled. By showing you the value of this  plate, which is of the finest silver we use in our shops, I will let you  see how much the Jew has cheated you.\"    The goldsmith took a pair of scales, weighed the dish, and assured him  that his plate would fetch by weight sixty pieces of gold, which he  offered to pay down immediately.    Aladdin thanked him for his fair dealing, and never after went to any  other person.    Though Aladdin and his mother had an inexhaustible treasure in their  lamp, and might have had whatever they wished for, yet they lived with  the same frugality as before, and it may easily be supposed that the  money for which Aladdin had sold the dishes and tray was sufficient to  maintain them some time.    During this interval, Aladdin frequented the shops of the principal  merchants, where they sold cloth of gold and silver, linens, silk  stuffs, and jewellery, and, oftentimes joining in their conversation,  acquired a knowledge of the world, and a desire to improve himself. By  his acquaintance among the jewellers, he came to know that the fruits  which he had gathered when he took the lamp were, instead of coloured  glass, stones of inestimable value; but he had the prudence not to  mention this to any one, not even to his mother.    One day as Aladdin was walking about the town, he heard an order  proclaimed, commanding the people to shut up their shops and houses, and  keep within doors while the Princess Buddir al Buddoor, the sultan's  daughter, went to the bath and returned.    This proclamation inspired Aladdin with eager desire to see the  princess's face, which he determined to gratify, by placing himself  behind the door of the bath, so that he could not fail to see her face.    Aladdin had not long concealed himself before the princess came. She was  attended by a great crowd of ladies, slaves, and mutes, who walked on  each side and behind her. When she came within three or four paces of  the door of the bath, she took off her veil, and gave Aladdin an  opportunity of a full view of her face.    The princess was a noted beauty: her eyes were large, lively, and  sparkling; her smile bewitching; her nose faultless; her mouth small;  her lips vermilion. It is not therefore surprising that Aladdin, who had  never before seen such a blaze of charms, was dazzled and enchanted.    After the princess had passed by, and entered the bath, Aladdin quitted  his hiding-place, and went home. His mother perceived him to be more  thoughtful and melancholy than usual; and asked what had happened to  make him so, or if he was ill. He then told his mother all his  adventure, and concluded by declaring, \"I love the princess more than I  can express, and am resolved that I will ask her in marriage of the  sultan.\"    Aladdin's mother listened with surprise to what her son told her; but  when he talked of asking the princess in marriage, she laughed aloud.  \"Alas! child,\" said she, \"what are you thinking of? You must be mad to  talk thus.\"    \"I assure you, mother,\" replied Aladdin, \"that I am not mad, but in my  right senses. I foresaw that you would reproach me with folly and  extravagance; but I must tell you once more, that I am resolved to  demand the princess of the sultan in marriage; nor do I despair of  success. I have the slaves of the lamp and of the ring to help me, and  you know how powerful their aid is. And I have another secret to tell  you: those pieces of glass, which I got from the trees in the garden of  the subterranean palace, are jewels of inestimable value, and fit fit  for the greatest monarchs. All the precious stones the jewellers have in  Bagdad are not to be compared to mine for size or beauty; and I am sure  that the offer of them will secure the favour of the sultan. You have a  large porcelain dish fit to hold them; fetch it, and let us see how they  will look, when we have arranged them according to their different  colours.\"    Aladdin's mother brought the china dish, when he took the jewels out of  the two purses in which he had kept them, and placed them in order,  according to his fancy. But the brightness and lustre they emitted in  the daytime, and the variety of the colours, so dazzled the eyes both of  mother and son, that they were astonished beyond measure. Aladdin's  mother, emboldened by the sight of these rich jewels, and fearful lest  her son should be guilty of greater extravagance, complied with his  request, and promised to go early in the next morning to the palace of  the sultan. Aladdin rose before daybreak, awakened his mother, pressing  her to go to the sultan's palace, and to get admittance, if possible,  before the grand vizier, the other viziers, and the great officers of  state went in to take their seats in the divan, where the sultan always  attended in person.    Aladdin's mother took the china dish, in which they had put the jewels  the day before, wrapped it in two fine napkins, and set forward for the  sultan's palace. When she came to the gates, the grand vizier, the other  viziers, and most distinguished lords of the court were just gone in;  but notwithstanding the crowd of people was great, she got into the  divan, a spacious hall, the entrance into which was very magnificent.  She placed herself just before the sultan, grand vizier, and the great  lords, who sat in council, on his right and left hand. Several causes  were called, according to their order, pleaded and adjudged, until the  time the divan generally broke up, when the sultan, rising, returned to  his apartment, attended by the grand vizier; the other viziers and  ministers of state then retired, as also did all those whose business  had called them thither.    Aladdin's mother, seeing the sultan retire, and all the people depart,  judged rightly that he would not sit again that day, and resolved to go  home; and on her arrival said, with much simplicity, \"Son, I have seen  the sultan, and am very well persuaded he has seen me, too, for I placed  myself just before him; but he was so much taken up with those who  attended on all sides of him that I pitied him, and wondered at his  patience. At last I believe he was heartily tired, for he rose up  suddenly, and would not hear a great many who were ready prepared to  speak to him, but went away, at which I was well pleased, for indeed I  began to lose all patience, and was extremely fatigued with staying so  long. But there is no harm done; I will go again to-morrow; perhaps the  sultan may not be so busy.\"    The next morning she repaired to the sultan's palace with the present,  as early as the day before; but when she came there, she found the gates  of the divan shut. She went six times afterward on the days appointed,  placed herself always directly before the sultan, but with as little  success as the first morning.    On the sixth day, however, after the divan was broken up, when the  sultan returned to his own apartment, he said to his grand vizier; \"I  have for some time observed a certain woman, who attends constantly  every day that I give audience, with something wrapped up in a napkin;  she always stands up from the beginning to the breaking up of the  audience, and affects to place herself just before me. If this woman  comes to our next audience, do not fail to call her, that I may hear  what she has to say.\" The grand vizier made answer by lowering his hand,  and then lifting it up above his head, signifying his willingness to  lose it if he failed.    On the next audience day, when Aladdin's mother went to the divan, and  placed herself in front of the sultan as usual, the grand vizier  immediately called the chief of the mace-bearers, and pointing to her  bade him bring her before the sultan. The old woman at once followed the  "]]]
