I  contemplated him with deep interest, analysing in silence the strange  expression of his countenance. Leaning on his elbow against an angle of  a costly mosaic table, he no longer saw me,--he had forgotten my  presence.    I did not disturb this reverie, and continued my observation of the  curiosities which enriched this drawing-room.    Under elegant glass cases, fixed by copper rivets, were classed and  labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been  presented to the eye of a naturalist.  My delight as a professor may be  conceived.    The division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious  specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes. In the first  group, the tubipores, were gorgones arranged like a fan, soft sponges  of Syria, ises of the Moluccas, pennatules, an admirable virgularia of  the Norwegian seas, variegated unbellulairae, alcyonariae, a whole  series of madrepores, which my master Milne Edwards has so cleverly  classified, amongst which I remarked some wonderful flabellinae  oculinae of the Island of Bourbon, the \"Neptune's car\" of the Antilles,  superb varieties of corals--in short, every species of those curious  polypi of which entire islands are formed, which will one day become  continents. Of the echinodermes, remarkable for their coating of  spines, asteri, sea-stars, pantacrinae, comatules, asterophons, echini,  holothuri, etc., represented individually a complete collection of this  group.    A somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before  other more numerous cases, in which were classified the specimens of  molluscs. It was a collection of inestimable value, which time fails me  to describe minutely. Amongst these specimens I will quote from memory  only the elegant royal hammer-fish of the Indian Ocean, whose regular  white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground, an imperial  spondyle, bright-coloured, bristling with spines, a rare specimen in  the European museums--(I estimated its value at not less than L1000); a  common hammer-fish of the seas of New Holland, which is only procured  with difficulty; exotic buccardia of Senegal; fragile white bivalve  shells, which a breath might shatter like a soap-bubble; several  varieties of the aspirgillum of Java, a kind of calcareous tube, edged  with leafy folds, and much debated by amateurs; a whole series of  trochi, some a greenish-yellow, found in the American seas, others a  reddish-brown, natives of Australian waters; others from the Gulf of  Mexico, remarkable for their imbricated shell; stellari found in the  Southern Seas; and last, the rarest of all, the magnificent spur of New  Zealand; and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which  science has given appropriate names.    Apart, in separate compartments, were spread out chaplets of pearls of  the greatest beauty, which reflected the electric light in little  sparks of fire; pink pearls, torn from the pinna-marina of the Red Sea;  green pearls of the haliotyde iris; yellow, blue and black pearls, the  curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean, and certain  mussels of the water-courses of the North; lastly, several specimens of  inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines.  Some of these pearls were larger than a pigeon's egg, and were worth as  much, and more than that which the traveller Tavernier sold to the Shah  of Persia for three millions, and surpassed the one in the possession  of the Imaum of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivalled in the  world.    Therefore, to estimate the value of this collection was simply  impossible.  Captain Nemo must have expended millions in the  acquirement of these various specimens, and I was thinking what source  he could have drawn from, to have been able thus to gratify his fancy  for collecting, when I was interrupted by these words:    \"You are examining my shells, Professor?  Unquestionably they must be  interesting to a naturalist; but for me they have a far greater charm,  for I have collected them all with my own hand, and there is not a sea  on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches.\"    \"I can understand, Captain, the delight of wandering about in the midst  of such riches.  You are one of those who have collected their  treasures themselves.  No museum in Europe possesses such a collection  of the produce of the ocean.  But if I exhaust all my admiration upon  it, I shall have none left for the vessel which carries it.  I do not  wish to pry into your secrets:  but I must confess that this Nautilus,  with the motive power which is confined in it, the contrivances which  enable it to be worked, the powerful agent which propels it, all excite  my curiosity to the highest pitch.  I see suspended on the walls of  this room instruments of whose use I am ignorant.\"    \"You will find these same instruments in my own room, Professor, where  I shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you.  But first  come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use.  You  must see how you will be accommodated on board the Nautilus.\"    I followed Captain Nemo who, by one of the doors opening from each  panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist.  He conducted me towards  the bow, and there I found, not a cabin, but an elegant room, with a  bed, dressing-table, and several other pieces of excellent furniture.    I could only thank my host.    \"Your room adjoins mine,\" said he, opening a door, \"and mine opens into  the drawing-room that we have just quitted.\"    I entered the Captain's room:  it had a severe, almost a monkish  aspect.  A small iron bedstead, a table, some articles for the toilet;  the whole lighted by a skylight.  No comforts, the strictest  necessaries only.    Captain Nemo pointed to a seat.    \"Be so good as to sit down,\" he said.  I seated myself, and he began  thus:        CHAPTER XI    ALL BY ELECTRICITY    \"Sir,\" said Captain Nemo, showing me the instruments hanging on the  walls of his room, \"here are the contrivances required for the  navigation of the Nautilus.  Here, as in the drawing-room, I have them  always under my eyes, and they indicate my position and exact direction  in the middle of the ocean.  Some are known to you, such as the  thermometer, which gives the internal temperature of the Nautilus; the  barometer, which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the  changes of the weather; the hygrometer, which marks the dryness of the  atmosphere; the storm-glass, the contents of which, by decomposing,  announce the approach of tempests; the compass, which guides my course;  the sextant, which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun;  chronometers, by which I calculate the longitude; and glasses for day  and night, which I use to examine the points of the horizon, when the  Nautilus rises to the surface of the waves.\"    \"These are the usual nautical instruments,\" I replied, \"and I know the  use of them.  But these others, no doubt, answer to the particular  requirements of the Nautilus.  This dial with movable needle is a  manometer, is it not?\"    \"It is actually a manometer.  But by communication with the water,  whose external pressure it indicates, it gives our depth at the same  time.\"    \"And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?\"    \"Here, Professor, I ought to give you some explanations.  Will you be  kind enough to listen to me?\"    He was silent for a few moments, then he said:    \"There is a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to  every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel.  Everything is done  by means of it.  It lights, warms it, and is the soul of my mechanical  apparatus.  This agent is electricity.\"    \"Electricity?\"  I cried in surprise.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Nevertheless, Captain, you possess an extreme rapidity of movement,  which does not agree well with the power of electricity.  Until now,  its dynamic force has remained under restraint, and has only been able  to produce a small amount of power.\"    \"Professor,\" said Captain Nemo, \"my electricity is not everybody's.  You know what sea-water is composed of.  In a thousand grammes are  found 96 1/2 per cent. of water, and about 2 2/3 per cent.  of chloride  of sodium; then, in a smaller quantity, chlorides of magnesium and of  potassium, bromide of magnesium, sulphate of magnesia, sulphate and  carbonate of lime.  You see, then, that chloride of sodium forms a  large part of it.  So it is this sodium that I extract from the  sea-water, and of which I compose my ingredients.  I owe all to the  ocean; it produces electricity, and electricity gives heat, light,  motion, and, in a word, life to the Nautilus.\"    \"But not the air you breathe?\"    \"Oh!  I could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption, but it  is useless, because I go up to the surface of the water when I please.  However, if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe, it  works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious  reservoirs, and which enable me to prolong at need, and as long as I  will, my stay in the depths of the sea.  It gives a uniform and  unintermittent light, which the sun does not.  Now look at this clock;  it is electrical, and goes with a regularity that defies the best  chronometers.  I have divided it into twenty-four hours, like the  Italian clocks, because for me there is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#12)"],[1,"to submerged stones or plants. The Chironomus pupa is usually  found in an elongate gelatinous case adhering to a stone. From this case  the pupa rises to the surface of the water, that the midge may emerge  into the air. Miall and Hammond (1900) describe the arrangement by  which, when the pupal stage ends, and these gills are no longer  required, their connection with the air-tube system is severed 'without  undue violence.' The walls of the fine air-tubes that pass into the  gills are specially strengthened, but just below the pupal cuticle these  walls are exceedingly thin and delicate. Thus when the pupal cuticle is  cast, they are readily broken there, and the cuticle of the midge  forming beneath has a spiracular opening into the main air-trunk, ready  for use during the insect's aerial life.    Among those Diptera whose larva is the headless maggot a most  remarkable arrangement for protecting the pupa is to be found. The last  larval cuticle, instead of being as usual worked off and cast, after  separation from the underlying structures, becomes hard and firm,  forming a protective case (_puparium_) within which by the processes of  histolysis and histogenesis already described the organs of the pupa and  imago are built up. This puparium (fig. 22 _d_) is usually dark in  colour, often brown and barrel-shaped, and a subcircular lid splits off  from it at the head-end to allow the emergence of the fly[11]. While the  maggot breathes by its tail-spiracles, the functional spiracles of the  puparium (connected with the tracheal system of the enclosed pupa) are  far forward, and these may be situated at the tips of long sometimes  branching processes, which recall the thoracic gills of the aquatic  pupae mentioned a few pages above. Adaptations, various and beautiful,  to special modes of life, are thus seen to characterise pupae as well as  larvae.    [11] The presence of this sub-circular lid characterises Brauer's  suborder Cyclorrhapha. Those Diptera in which the pupal cuticle splits  in the normal, longitudinal manner are included in the Orthorrhapha (see  p. 67).          CHAPTER VIII    THE LIFE-STORY AND THE SEASONS      A number of interesting questions are associated with the seasonal cycle  of an insect's life-history. In a previous chapter (IV. pp. 30, 34)  reference has been made to the contrast between the long aquatic life of  the larval dragon-fly or may-fly, extending over several years, and the  short aerial existence of the winged adult restricted in the case of the  may-flies to a few hours. Here we see that the feeding activities of the  insect are carried on during the larval stage only; the may-fly in its  winged condition takes no food, pairing and egg-laying form the whole of  its appointed task. A similar though less extreme shortening of the  imaginal life may be noticed in many endopterygote insects. For example,  the bot- and warble-flies have the jaws so far reduced that they are  unable to feed, and the parasitic life of the maggot (see p. 74)  extending over eight or nine months in the body of the horse or ox,  prepares for a winged existence of probably but a few days. Again in  many moths the jaws are reduced or vestigial so that no food can be  taken in the winged state, as for example in the 'Eggars'  (Lasiocampidae) and the 'Tussocks' (Lymantriidae). It is noteworthy  that in these short-lived insects the male is often provided with  elaborate sense-organs which, we may believe, assist him to find a mate  with as little delay as possible; the male may-fly has especially  complex eyes, while the feelers of the male silk-moth or eggar are  comb-like or feathery, the branches bearing thousands of sensory hairs.  A box with a captive living female of one of these moths, if taken into  a wood haunted by the species becomes rapidly surrounded by a swarm of  would-be suitors, attracted by the odour emitted from the prisoner's  scent-glands.    Very exceptionally the imaginal stage may be omitted from the life-story  altogether. Nearly fifty years ago N. Wagner (1865) made the remarkable  discovery that in the larvae of certain gall-midges (Cecidomyidae) the  ovaries might become precociously mature and unfertilised eggs might be  developed into small larvae observable within the body of the  mother-larva; ultimately these abnormally reared young break their way  out. In this case therefore there may be a series of larval generations,  neither pupa nor imago being formed. Extended observations on the  precocious reproductive processes of these midges have lately been  published by W. Kahle (1908). A less extreme instance of an abbreviated  life-story was made known by O. Grimm (1870) who saw pupae of  Harlequin-midges (Chironomus) lay unfertilised eggs, which developed  into larvae. Here the imaginal stage only is omitted from the  life-history. Not always however is it the imaginal stage of the  life-history which is shortened. Reference (p. 18) has already been made  to the case of the virgin female aphids, whose eggs develop within the  mother's body, so that active, formed young are brought forth. Among the  Diptera it is not unusual to find similar cases, the female fly giving  birth to young maggots instead of laying eggs. Such is the habit of the  great flesh-fly (Sarcophaga), of some allied genera (Tachina, etc.)  whose larvae live as parasites on other insects, and occasionally of the  Sheep Bot-fly (Oestrus). In such cases we recognise the beginning of a  shortened larval period, and Brace's investigations in 1895, summarised  by E.E. Austen (1911), have shown that females of the dreaded African  Tsetse flies (Glossinia) bring forth nearly mature larvae, which pupate  soon after birth. In another group of Diptera, the blood-sucking  parasites of the Hippoboscidae and allied families, the whole larval  development is passed through within the mother's body, and a full-grown  larva is born the cuticle of which hardens and darkens immediately to  form a puparium; hence these flies are often called, though incorrectly,  Pupipara. Still more astonishing is the mode of reproduction in the  allied family of the Termitoxeniidae, curious, degraded, wingless  'guests' of the termites, or 'white ants,' lately made known through the  researches of E. Wasmann (1901). Here the individual is hermaphrodite--a  most exceptional condition among insects--and lays a large egg, whence  is usually hatched a fully-developed adult! Here then we find that all  the early stages, usual in the higher insects, are omitted from the  life-story.    Interesting comparison may be made between the total duration of various  insect life-stories. To some extent at least, the length of an insect's  life is correlated with its size, its food, the season of the year when  it breeds. Small insects have, as a rule, shorter lives than large ones;  those whose larvae devour highly nutritive food generally develop more  quickly than those which have to live on dry, poor, substances;  life-cycles follow one another most rapidly in summer weather when  temperature is high and food plentiful.    In early chapters we have already noticed the long aquatic life of the  larva and nymph of a dragon-fly, relatively a large insect, and the  rapid multiplication of the repeated summer broods of virgin aphids (p.  18). Within the one order of the Coleoptera it is instructive to compare  the small jumping leaf-beetles, the 'turnip-flies' of the farmer, whose  larvae mine in the green tissues, and complete their transformations so  rapidly that several successive broods appear in the spring and early  summer, with the larger click-beetles whose larvae, the equally  notorious 'wireworms,' feed on roots for three or four years before they  become fully grown. Among the Diptera, the 'leather-jacket' grub of the  crane-fly, feeding like the wireworm on roots, has a larval life  extending through the greater part of a year, while the maggot of the  bluebottle, feeding on a rich meat diet, becomes mature in a few days.  As examples of excessively long life-cycles the 'thirteen-year' and  'seventeen-year' cicads of North America, described by C.L. Marlatt  (1895), are noteworthy. Certain specially populous 'broods' of these  insects are known and localised, so that the appearance of the imagos in  future years can be accurately predicted. Here again we have to do with  bulky insects whose subterranean larvae and nymphs feed on comparatively  innutritious roots.    In our own climate, it is of interest to notice the variation among  insects as to the stage which carries the race over the winter. The  click-beetles, mentioned just above, emerge from their buried pupae in  summer, hibernate under stones or clods, and lay eggs among the herbage  next spring. At the same time of course, owing to the extended term of  the larval life, many more individuals of the species are wintering  underground as 'wireworms' of various ages, and these, except in very  severe frosts, can continue their occupation of feeding on roots. But in  the case of the 'turnip-flies' the food-supply is cut off in winter, and  all those beetles of the latest summer brood that survive hibernate in  some sheltered spot, waiting for the return of spring, that they may lay  their eggs, and start the life-cycle once again. Among the Diptera, most  species pass the winter as pupae, the sheltering puparium being a good  protection against most adverse conditions, or as flies. But where there  is a prolonged parasitic larval life, as with the bot- and warble-flies,  the maggot, warm and well-fed within the body of its mammalian host,  affords an appropriate wintering stage.    Among the Hymenoptera an especially interesting seasonal life-cycle is  afforded by the alternation of summer and winter generations in many  Gall-flies (Cynipidae) as H. Adler (1881, 1896) demonstrated for most of  our common species. The well-known 'oak-apples' are tenanted in summer  by"]]]
