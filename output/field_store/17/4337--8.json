[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15675"],[0,"A Voyage to New Holland, Etc. in the Year 1699 (#12)"],[1,".    The curresos (called here mackeraws) are such as are in the Bay of  Campeachy.    Turtledoves are in great plenty here; and two sorts of wild pigeons; the  one sort blackish, the other a light grey: the blackish or dark grey are  the bigger, being as large as our wood-quests, or wood-pigeons in  England. Both sorts are very good meat; and are in such plenty from May  till September that a man may shoot 8 or 10 dozen in several shots at one  standing, in a close misty morning, when they come to feed on berries  that grow in the woods.    The jenetee is a bird as big as a lark with black feathers, and yellow  legs and feet. It is accounted very wholesome food.    CLOCKING-HEN, CRAB-CATCHER, GALDEN, AND BLACK HERON: THE DUCKS, WIDGEON  AND TEAL; AND OSTRICHES TO THE SOUTHWARD, AND OF THE DUNGHILL-FOWLS.    Clocking-hens are much like the crab-catchers which I have described, but  the legs are not altogether so long. They keep always in swampy wet  places, though their claws are like land-fowls' claws. They make a noise  or cluck like our brood-hens, or dunghill-hens, when they have chickens,  and for that reason they are called by the English clocking-hens. There  are many of them in the Bay of Campeachy (though I omitted to speak of  them there) and elsewhere in the West Indies. There are both here and  there four sorts of these long-legged fowls, near akin to each other as  so many sub-species of the same kind; namely crab-catchers,  clocking-hens, galdens (which three are in shape and colour like herons  in England, but less; the galden, the biggest of the three, the  crab-catcher the smallest) and a fourth sort which are black, but shaped  like the other, having long legs and short tails; these are about the  bigness of crab-catchers, and feed as they do.    Currecoos are waterfowls, as big as pretty large chickens, of a bluish  colour, with short legs and tail; they feed also in swampy ground and are  very good meat. I have not seen of them elsewhere.    The wild ducks here are said to be of two sorts, the muscovy and the  common ducks. In the wet season here are abundance of them, but in the  dry time but few. Widgeon and teal also are said to be in great plenty  here in the wet season.    To the southward of Bahia there are also ostriches in great plenty,  though it is said they are not so large as those of Africa: they are  found chiefly in the southern parts of Brazil, especially among the large  savannahs near the river of Plate; and from thence further south towards  the Straits of Magellan.    As for tame fowl at Bahia the chief beside their ducks are  dunghill-fowls, of which they have two sorts; one sort much of the size  of our cocks and hens; the other very large: and the feathers of these  last are a long time coming forth: so that you see them very naked when  half grown; but when they are full-grown and well feathered they appear  very large fowls, as indeed they are; neither do they want for price; for  they are sold at Bahia for half-a-crown or three shillings apiece, just  as they are brought first to market out of the country, when they are so  lean as to be scarce fit to eat.    OF THEIR CATTLE, HORSES, ETC.    The land animals here are horses, black cattle, sheep, goats, rabbits,  hogs, leopards, tigers, foxes, monkeys, peccary (a sort of wild hogs  called here pica) armadillo, alligators, iguanas (called quittee)  lizards, serpents, toads, frogs, and a sort of amphibious creatures  called by the Portuguese cachoras-de-agua, in English water-dogs.    LEOPARDS AND TIGERS.    The leopards and tigers of this country are said to be large and very  fierce: but here on the coast they are either destroyed or driven back  towards the heart of the country; and therefore are seldom found but in  the borders and out-plantations, where they oftentimes do mischief. Here  are three or four sorts of monkeys, of different sizes and colours. One  sort is very large; and another sort is very small: these last are ugly  in shape and feature and have a strong scent of musk.    OF THEIR SERPENTS; THE RATTLESNAKE, SMALL GREEN SNAKE. AMPHISBAENA, SMALL  BLACK AND SMALL GREY SNAKE; THE GREAT LAND-SNAKE, AND THE GREAT  WATERSNAKE; AND OF THE WATER-DOG.    They have here also the amphisbaena, or two-headed snake, of a grey  colour, mixed with blackish stripes, whose bite is reckoned to be  incurable. It is said to be blind, though it has two small specks in each  head like eyes: but whether it sees or not I cannot tell. They say it  lives like a mole, mostly underground; and that when it is found above  ground it is easily killed, because it moves but slowly: neither is its  sight (if it hath any) so good as to discern anyone that comes near to  kill it: as few of these creatures fly at a man or hurt him but when he  comes in their way. It is about 14 inches long and about the bigness of  the inner joint of a man's middle finger; being of one and the same  bigness from one end to the other, with a head at each end (as they said;  for I cannot vouch it, for one I had was cut short at one end) and both  alike in shape and bigness; and it is said to move with either head  foremost, indifferently; whence it is called by the Portuguese  cobra-de-dos-cabesas, the snake with two heads.    The small black snake is a very venomous creature.    There is also a grey snake, with red and brown spots all over its back.  It is as big as a man's arm and about 3 foot long, and is said to be  venomous. I saw one of these.    Here are two sorts of very large snakes or serpents: one of them a  land-snake, the other a water-snake. The land-snake is of a grey colour,  and about 18 or 20 foot long: not very venomous, but ravenous. I was  promised the sight of one of their skins but wanted opportunity.    The water-snake is said to be near 30 foot long. These live wholly in the  water, either in large rivers or great lakes, and prey upon any creature  that comes within their reach, be it man or beast. They draw their prey  to them with their tails: for when they see anything on the banks of the  river or lake where they lurk they swing about their tails 10 or 12 foot  over the bank; and whatever stands within their sweep is snatched with  great violence into the river, and drowned by them. Nay it is reported  very credibly that if they see only a shade of any animal at all on the  water, they will flourish their tails to bring in the man or beast whose  shade they see and are oftentimes too successful in it. Wherefore men  that have business near any place where these water-monsters are  suspected to lurk are always provided with a gun, which they often fire,  and that scares them away or keeps them quiet. They are said to have  great heads and strong teeth about 6 inches long. I was told by an  Irishman who lived here that his wife's father was very near being taken  by one of them, about this time of my first arrival here, when his father  was with him up in the country: for the beast flourished his tail for  him, but came not nigh enough by a yard or two; however it scared him  sufficiently.    The amphibious creatures here which I said are called by the Portuguese  cachoras-de-agua or water-dogs, are said to be as big as small mastiffs,  and are all hairy and shaggy from head to tail. They have 4 short legs, a  pretty long head and short tail; and are of a blackish colour. They live  in fresh-water ponds and oftentimes come ashore and sun themselves; but  retire to the water if assaulted. They are eaten and said to be good  food. Several of these creatures which I have now spoken of I have not  seen, but informed myself about them while I was here at Bahia, from  sober and sensible persons among the inhabitants, among whom I met with  some that could speak English.    OF THEIR SEA-FISH AND TURTLE; AND OF ST. PAUL'S TOWN.    In the sea upon this coast there is great store and diversity of fish,  namely jew-fish for which there is a great market at Bahia in Lent:  tarpon, mullet, grouper, snook, garfish (called here goolions) gorasses,  barramas, coquindas, cavallies, cachoras (or dogfish) conger eels,  herring (as I was told) the serrew, the olio-de-boy (I write and spell  them just as they were named to me) whales, etc.    Here is also shellfish (though in less plenty about Bahia than on other  parts of the coast) namely lobsters, crawfish, shrimps, crabs, oysters of  the common sort, conches, wilks, cockles, mussels, periwinkles, etc. Here  are three sorts of sea-turtle, namely hawksbill, loggerhead, and green:  but none of them are in any esteem, neither Spaniards nor Portuguese  loving them: nay they have a great antipathy against them, and would much  rather eat a porpoise, though our English count the green turtle very  extraordinary food. The reason that is commonly given in the West Indies  for the Spaniards not caring to eat of them is the fear they have lest,  being usually foul-bodied and many of them poxed (lying, as they do, so  promiscuously with their negrines and other she-slaves) they should break  out loathsomely like lepers; which this sort of food, it is said, does  much incline men to do, searching the body, and driving out any such  gross humours: for which cause many of our English valetudinarians have  gone from Jamaica (though there they have also turtle) to the island  Cayman, at the laying time, to live wholly upon turtle that then abound  there; purposely to have their bodies scoured by this food, and their  distempers driven out; and have been said to have found many of them good  success in it. But this by the way. The hawksbill-turtle on this coast of  Brazil is most sought after of any, for its shell; which by report of  those I have conversed with at Bahia, is the clearest and best clouded  tortoise-shell in the world. I had some of it shown me which was indeed  as good as ever I saw. They get a pretty deal of it in some parts on this  coast; but it is very dear.    Beside this port of Bahia de"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#12)"],[1,"of Boston to be his guests. At the head of  the table, in our great chair, sat Sir William Phips himself, treating  these hard handed men as his brethren, cracking jokes with them, and  talking familiarly about old times. I know not whether he wore his  embroidered dress, but I rather choose to imagine that he had on a suit of  rough clothes, such as he used to labor in, while he was Phips the  ship-carpenter.\"    \"An aristocrat need not be ashamed of the trade,\" observed Laurence; \"for  the czar Peter the Great once served an apprenticeship to it.\"    \"Did Sir William Phips make as good a governor as he was a  ship-carpenter?\" asked Charley.    \"History says but little about his merits as a ship-carpenter,\" answered  Grandfather; \"but, as a governor, a great deal of fault was found with  him. Almost as soon as he assumed the government, he became engaged in a  very frightful business, which might have perplexed a wiser and better  cultivated head than his. This was the witchcraft delusion.\"    And here Grandfather gave his auditors such details of this melancholy  affair, as he thought it fit for them to know. They shuddered to hear that  a frenzy, which led to the death of many innocent persons, had originated  in the wicked arts of a few children. They belonged to the Rev. Mr.  Parris, minister of Salem. These children complained of being pinched, and  pricked with pins, and otherwise tormented by the shapes of men and women,  who were supposed to have power to haunt them invisibly, both in darkness  and daylight. Often, in the midst of their family and friends, the  children would pretend to be seized with strange convulsions, and would  cry out that the witches were afflicting them.    These stories spread abroad, and caused great tumult and alarm. From the  foundation of New England, it had been the custom of the inhabitants, in  all matters of doubt and difficulty, to look to their ministers for  council. So they did now; but, unfortunately, the ministers and wise men  were more deluded than the illiterate people. Cotton Mather, a very  learned and eminent clergyman, believed that the whole country was full of  witches and wizards, who had given up their hopes of heaven, and signed a  covenant with the Evil One.    Nobody could be certain that his nearest neighbor, or most intimate  friend, was not guilty of this imaginary crime. The number of those who  pretended to be afflicted by witchcraft, grew daily more numerous; and  they bore testimony against many of the best and worthiest people. A  minister, named George Burroughs, was among the accused. In the months of  August and September, 1692, he, and nineteen other innocent men and women,  were put to death. The place of execution was a high hill, on the  outskirts of Salem; so that many of the sufferers, as they stood beneath  the gallows, could discern their own habitations in the town.    The martyrdom of these guiltless persons seemed only to increase the  madness. The afflicted now grew bolder in their accusations. Many people  of rank and wealth were either thrown into prison, or compelled to flee  for their lives. Among these were two sons of old Simon Bradstreet, the  last of the Puritan governors. Mr. Willard, a pious minister of Boston,  was cried out upon as a wizard, in open court. Mrs. Hale, the wife of the  minister of Beverly, was likewise accused. Philip English, a rich merchant  of Salem, found it necessary to take flight, leaving his property and  business in confusion. But a short time afterwards, the Salem people were  glad to invite him back.    \"The boldest thing that the accusers did,\" continued Grandfather, \"was to  cry out against the governor's own beloved wife. Yes; the lady of Sir  William Phips was accused of being a witch, and of flying through the air  to attend witch meetings. When the governor heard this, he probably  trembled, so that our great chair shook beneath him.\"    \"Dear Grandfather,\" cried little Alice, clinging closer to his knee, \"is  it true that witches ever come in the night-time to frighten little  children?\"    \"No, no, dear little Alice,\" replied Grandfather. \"Even if there were any  witches, they would flee away from the presence of a pure-hearted child.  But there are none; and our forefathers soon became convinced, that they  had been led into a terrible delusion. All the prisoners on account of  witchcraft were set free. But the innocent dead could not be restored to  life; and the hill where they were executed, will always remind people of  the saddest and most humiliating passage in our history.\"    Grandfather then said, that the next remarkable event, while Sir William  Phips remained in the chair, was the arrival at Boston of an English  fleet, in 1693. It brought an army, which was intended for the conquest of  Canada. But a malignant disease, more fatal than the small-pox, broke out  among the soldiers and sailors, and destroyed the greater part of them.  The infection spread into the town of Boston, and made much havoc there.  This dreadful sickness caused the governor, and Sir Francis Wheeler, who  was commander of the British forces, to give up all thoughts of attacking  Canada.    \"Soon after this,\" said Grandfather, \"Sir William Phips quarrelled with  the captain of an English frigate, and also with the Collector of Boston.  Being a man of violent temper, he gave each of them a sound beating with  his cane.\"    \"He was a bold fellow,\" observed Charley, who was himself somewhat  addicted to a similar mode of settling disputes.    \"More bold than wise,\" replied Grandfather; \"for complaints were carried  to the king, and Sir William Phips was summoned to England, to make the  best answer he could. Accordingly he went to London, where, in 1695, he  was seized with a malignant fever, of which he died. Had he lived longer,  he would probably have gone again in search of sunken treasure. He had  heard of a Spanish ship, which was cast away in 1502, during the lifetime  of Columbus. Bovadilla, Roldan, and many other Spaniards, were lost in  her, together with the immense wealth of which they had robbed the South  American kings.\"    \"Why, Grandfather,\" exclaimed Laurence, \"what magnificent ideas the  governor had! Only think of recovering all that old treasure, which had  lain almost two centuries under the sea! Me thinks Sir William Phips ought  to have been buried in the ocean, when he died; so that he might have gone  down among the sunken ships, and cargoes of treasure, which he was always  dreaming about in his lifetime.\"    \"He was buried in one of the crowded cemeteries of London,\" said  Grandfather. \"As he left no children, his estate was inherited by his  nephew, from whom is descended the present Marquis of Normandy. The noble  Marquis is not aware, perhaps, that the prosperity of his family  originated in the successful enterprise of a New England ship carpenter.\"          Chapter III      \"At the death of Sir William Phips,\" proceeded Grandfather, \"our chair was  bequeathed to Mr. Ezekiel Cheever, a famous school-master in Boston. This  old gentleman came from London in 1637, and had been teaching school ever  since; so that there were now aged men, grandfathers like myself, to whom  Master Cheever had taught their alphabet. He was a person of venerable  aspect, and wore a long white beard.    \"Was the chair placed in his school?\" asked Charley.    \"Yes, in his school,\" answered Grandfather; \"and we may safely say that it  had never before been regarded with such awful reverence--no, not even when  the old governors of Massachusetts sat in it. Even you, Charley, my boy,  would have felt some respect for the chair, if you had seen it occupied by  this famous school-master.\"    And here Grandfather endeavored to give his auditors an idea how matters  were managed in schools above a hundred years ago. As this will probably  be an interesting subject to our readers, we shall make a separate sketch  of it, and call it        THE OLD-FASHIONED SCHOOL      Now imagine yourselves, my children, in Master Ezekiel Cheever's  school-room. It is a large, dingy room, with a sanded floor, and is  lighted by windows that turn on hinges, and have little diamond shaped  panes of glass. The scholars sit on long benches, with desks before them.  At one end of the room is a great fire-place, so very spacious, that there  is room enough for three or four boys to stand in each of the chimney  corners. This was the good old fashion of fire-places, when there was wood  enough in the forests to keep people warm, without their digging into the  bowels of the earth for coal.    It is a winter's day when we take our peep into the school-room. See what  great logs of wood have been rolled into the fire-place, and what a broad,  bright blaze goes leaping up the chimney! And every few moments, a vast  cloud of smoke is puffed into the room, which sails slowly over the heads  of the scholars, until it gradually settles upon the walls and ceiling.  They are blackened with the smoke of many years already.                                    [Image #2]    Next, look at our old historic chair! It is placed, you perceive, in the  most comfortable part of the room, where the generous glow of the fire is  sufficiently felt, without being too intensely hot. How stately the old  chair looks, as if it remembered its many famous occupants, but yet were  conscious that a greater man is sitting in it now! Do you see the  venerable school-master, severe in aspect, with a black scull-cap on his  head, like an ancient Puritan, and the snow of his white beard drifting  down to his very girdle? What boy would dare to play, or whisper, or even  glance aside from his book, while Master Cheever is on the look-out,  behind his spectacles! For such offenders, if any such there be, a rod of  birch is hanging over the fire-place, and a heavy ferule lies on the  master's desk.    And now school is begun. What a murmur of"]]]
