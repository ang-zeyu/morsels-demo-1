Ernest was about to withdraw discreetly, when the electric  light that was burning in the hallway fell upon her face and illumined  it.    Then indeed surprise overcame him. \"Ethel,\" he cried, \"is it you?\"          XXIII      Ernest conducted Ethel Brandenbourg to his room and helped her to remove  her cloak.    While he was placing the garment upon the back of a chair, she slipped a  little key into her hand-bag. He looked at her with a question in his  eyes.    \"Yes,\" she replied, \"I kept the key; but I had not dreamed that I would  ever again cross this threshold.\"    Meanwhile it had grown quite dark. The reflection of the street lanterns  without dimly lit the room, and through the twilight fantastic shadows  seemed to dance.    The perfume of her hair pervaded the room and filled the boy's heart  with romance. Tenderness long suppressed called with a thousand voices.  The hour, the strangeness and unexpectedness of her visit, perhaps even  a boy's pardonable vanity, roused passion from its slumbers and once  again wrought in Ernest's soul the miracle of love. His arm encircled  her neck and his lips stammered blind, sweet, crazy and caressing  things.    \"Turn on the light,\" she pleaded.    \"You were not always so cruel.\"    \"No matter, I have not come to speak of love.\"    \"Why, then, have you come?\"    Ernest felt a little awkward, disappointed, as he uttered these words.    What could have induced her to come to his rooms? He loosened his hold  on her and did as she asked.    How pale she looked in the light, how beautiful! Surely, she had  sorrowed for him; but why had she not answered his letter? Yes, why?    \"Your letter?\" She smiled a little sadly. \"Surely you did not expect me  to answer that?\"    \"Why not?\" He had again approached her and his lips were close to hers.  \"Why not? I have yearned for you. I love you.\"    His breath intoxicated her; it was like a subtle perfume. Still she did  not yield.    \"You love me now--you did not love me then. The music of your words was  cold--machine-made, strained and superficial. I shall not answer, I told  myself: in his heart he has forgotten you. I did not then realise that a  dangerous force had possessed your life and crushed in your mind every  image but its own.\"    \"I don't understand.\"    \"Do you think I would have come here if it were a light matter? No, I  tell you, it is a matter of life and death to you, at least as an  artist.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"Have you done a stroke of work since I last saw you?\"    \"Yes, let me see, surely, magazine articles and a poem.\"    \"That is not what I want to know. Have you accomplished anything big?  Have you grown since this summer? How about your novel?\"    \"I--I have almost finished it in my mind, but I have found no chance to  begin with the actual writing. I was sick of late, very sick.\"    No doubt of it! His face was pinched and pale, and the lines about the  mouth were curiously contorted, like those of a man suffering from a  painful internal disease.    \"Tell me,\" she ventured, \"do you ever miss anything?\"    \"Do you mean--are there thieves?\"    \"Thieves! Against thieves one can protect oneself.\"    He stared at her wildly, half-frightened, in anticipation of some  dreadful revelation. His dream! His dream! That hand! Could it be more  than a dream? God! His lips quivered.    Ethel observed his agitation and continued more quietly, but with the  same insistence: \"Have you ever had ideas, plans that you began without  having strength to complete them? Have you had glimpses of vocal visions  that seemed to vanish no sooner than seen? Did it ever seem to you as if  some mysterious and superior will brutally interfered with the workings  of your brain?\"    Did it seem so to him! He himself could not have stated more plainly  the experience of the last few months. Each word fell from her lips like  the blow of a hammer. Shivering, he put his arm around her, seeking  solace, not love. This time she did not repulse him and, trustingly, as  a child confides to his mother, he depicted to her the suffering that  harrowed his life and made it a hell.    As she listened, indignation clouded her forehead, while rising tears of  anger and of love weighed down her lashes. She could bear the pitiful  sight no longer.    \"Child,\" she cried, \"do you know who your tormentor is?\"    And like a flash the truth passed from her to him. A sudden intimation  told him what her words had still concealed.    \"Don't! For Christ's sake, do not pronounce his name!\" he sobbed. \"Do  not breathe it. I could not endure it. I should go mad.\"          XXIV      Very quietly, with difficulty restraining her own emotion so as not to  excite him further, Ethel had related to Ernest the story of her  remarkable interview with Reginald Clarke. In the long silence that  ensued, the wings of his soul brushed against hers for the first time,  and Love by a thousand tender chains of common suffering welded their  beings into one.    Caressingly the ivory of her fingers passed through the gold of his hair  and over his brow, as if to banish the demon-eyes that stared at him  across the hideous spaces of the past. In a rush a thousand incidents  came back to him, mute witnesses of a damning truth. His play, the  dreams that tormented him, his own inability to concentrate his mind  upon his novel which hitherto he had ascribed to nervous disease--all,  piling fact on fact, became one monstrous monument of Reginald Clarke's  crime. At last Ernest understood the parting words of Abel Felton and  the look in Ethel's eye on the night when he had first linked his fate  with the other man's. Walkham's experience, too, and Reginald's remarks  on the busts of Shakespeare and Balzac unmistakably pointed toward the  new and horrible spectre that Ethel's revelation had raised in place of  his host.    And then, again, the other Reginald appeared, crowned with the lyric  wreath. From his lips golden cadences fell, sweeter than the smell of  many flowers or the sound of a silver bell. He was once more the divine  master, whose godlike features bore no trace of malice and who had  raised him to a place very near his heart.    \"No,\" he cried, \"it is impossible. It's all a dream, a horrible  nightmare.\"    \"But he has himself confessed it,\" she interjected.    \"Perhaps he has spoken in symbols. We all absorb to some extent other  men's ideas, without robbing them and wrecking their thought-life.  Reginald may be unscrupulous in the use of his power of impressing upon  others the stamp of his master-mind. So was Shakespeare. No, no, no!  You are mistaken; we were both deluded for the moment by his picturesque  account of a common, not even a discreditable, fact. He may himself have  played with the idea, but surely he cannot have been serious.\"    \"And your own experience, and Abel Felton's and mine--can they, too, be  dismissed with a shrug of the shoulder?\"    \"But, come to think of it, the whole theory seems absurd. It is  unscientific. It is not even a case of mesmerism. If he had said that he  hypnotised his victims, the matter would assume a totally different  aspect. I admit that something is wrong somewhere, and that the home of  Reginald Clarke is no healthful abode for me. But you must also remember  that probably we are both unstrung to the point of hysteria.\"    But to Ethel his words carried no conviction.    \"You are still under his spell,\" she cried, anxiously.    A little shaken in his confidence, Ernest resumed: \"Reginald is utterly  incapable of such an action, even granting that he possessed the  terrible power of which you speak. A man of his splendid resources, a  literary Midas at whose very touch every word turns into gold, is under  no necessity to prey on the thoughts of others. Circumstances, I admit,  are suspicious. But in the light of common day this fanciful theory  shrivels into nothing. Any court of law would reject our evidence as  madness. It is too utterly fantastic, utterly alien to any human  experience.\"    \"Is it though?\" Ethel replied with peculiar intonation.    \"Why, what do you mean?\"    \"Surely,\" she answered, \"you must know that in the legends of every  nation we read of men and women who were called vampires. They are  beings, not always wholly evil, whom every night some mysterious impulse  leads to steal into unguarded bedchambers, to suck the blood of the  sleepers and then, having waxed strong on the life of their victims,  cautiously to retreat. Thence comes it that their lips are very red. It  is even said that they can find no rest in the grave, but return to  their former haunts long after they are believed to be dead. Those whom  they visit, however, pine away for no apparent reason. The physicians  shake their wise heads and speak of consumption. But sometimes, ancient  chronicles assure us, the people's suspicions were aroused, and under  the leadership of a good priest they went in solemn procession to the  graves of the persons suspected. And on opening the tombs it was found  that their coffins had rotted away and the flowers in their hair were  black. But their bodies were white and whole; through no empty sockets  crept the vermin, and their sucking lips were still moist with a little  blood.\"    Ernest was carried away in spite of himself by her account, which  vividly resembled his own experience. Still he would not give in.    \"All this is impressive. I admit it is very impressive. But you yourself  speak of such stories as legends. They are unfounded upon any tangible  fact, and you cannot expect a man schooled in modern sciences to admit,  as having any possible bearing upon his life, the crude belief of the  Middle Ages!\"    \"Why not?\" she responded. \"Our scientists have proved true the wildest  theories of mediaeval scholars.

If you are just an ordinary person,  you won't pay any attention to this because there is only a little of it  and because what you are after is the coke and gas. You regard the  nasty, smelly mess that comes in between as merely a nuisance because it  clogs up and spoils your nice, clean tube.    Now that is the way the gas-makers and coke-makers--being for the most  part ordinary persons and not born chemists--used to regard the water  and tar that got into their pipes. They washed it out so as to have the  gas clean and then ran it into the creek. But the neighbors--especially  those who fished in the stream below the gas-works--made a fuss about  spoiling the water, so the gas-men gave away the tar to the boys for use  in celebrating the Fourth of July and election night or sold it for  roofing.

The coke is being pushed out of  one of the ovens into the waiting car. The vapors given off from the  coal contain ammonia and the benzene compound used to make dyes and  explosives]    [Illustration: IN THESE MIXING VATS AT THE BUFFALO WORKS, ANILINE DYES  ARE PREPARED]    But this same tar, which for a hundred years was thrown away and nearly  half of which is thrown away yet in the United States, turns out to be  one of the most useful things in the world. It is one of the strategic  points in war and commerce. It wounds and heals. It supplies munitions  and medicines. It is like the magic purse of Fortunatus from which  anything wished for could be drawn. The chemist puts his hand into the  black mass and draws out all the colors of the rainbow. This  evil-smelling substance beats the rose in the production of perfume and  surpasses the honey-comb in sweetness.    Bishop Berkeley, after having proved that all matter was in your mind,  wrote a book to prove that wood tar would cure all diseases. Nobody  reads it now. The name is enough to frighten them off: \"Siris: A Chain  of Philosophical Reflections and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tar  Water.\" He had a sort of mystical idea that tar contained the  quintessence of the forest, the purified spirit of the trees, which  could somehow revive the spirit of man. People said he was crazy on the  subject, and doubtless he was, but the interesting thing about it is  that not even his active and ingenious imagination could begin to  suggest all of the strange things that can be got out of tar, whether  wood or coal.    The reason why tar supplies all sorts of useful material is because it  is indeed the quintessence of the forest, of the forests of untold  millenniums if it is coal tar. If you are acquainted with a village  tinker, one of those all-round mechanics who still survive in this age  of specialization and can mend anything from a baby-carriage to an  automobile, you will know that he has on the floor of his back shop a  heap of broken machinery from which he can get almost anything he wants,  a copper wire, a zinc plate, a brass screw or a steel rod. Now coal tar  is the scrap-heap of the vegetable kingdom. It contains a little of  almost everything that makes up trees. But you must not imagine that all  that comes out of coal tar is contained in it. There are only about a  dozen primary products extracted from coal tar, but from these the  chemist is able to build up hundreds of thousands of new substances.  This is true creative chemistry, for most of these compounds are not to  be found in plants and never existed before they were made in the  laboratory. It used to be thought that organic compounds, the products  of vegetable and animal life, could only be produced by organized  beings, that they were created out of inorganic matter by the magic  touch of some \"vital principle.\" But since the chemist has learned how,  he finds it easier to make organic than inorganic substances and he is  confident that he can reproduce any compound that he can analyze. He  cannot only imitate the manufacturing processes of the plants and  animals, but he can often beat them at their own game.    When coal is heated in the open air it is burned up and nothing but the  ashes is left. But heat the coal in an enclosed vessel, say a big  fireclay retort, and it cannot burn up because the oxygen of the air  cannot get to it. So it breaks up. All parts of it that can be volatized  at a high heat pass off through the outlet pipe and nothing is left in  the retort but coke, that is carbon with the ash it contains. When the  escaping vapors reach a cool part of the outlet pipe the oily and tarry  matter condenses out. Then the gas is passed up through a tower down  which water spray is falling and thus is washed free from ammonia and  everything else that is soluble in water.    This process is called \"destructive distillation.\" What products come  off depends not only upon the composition of the particular variety of  coal used, but upon the heat, pressure and rapidity of distillation. The  way you run it depends upon what you are most anxious to have. If you  want illuminating gas you will leave in it the benzene. If you are after  the greatest yield of tar products, you impoverish the gas by taking out  the benzene and get a blue instead of a bright yellow flame. If all you  are after is cheap coke, you do not bother about the by-products, but  let them escape and burn as they please. The tourist passing across the  coal region at night could see through his car window the flames of  hundreds of old-fashioned bee-hive coke-ovens and if he were of  economical mind he might reflect that this display of fireworks was  costing the country $75,000,000 a year besides consuming the  irreplaceable fuel supply of the future. But since the gas was not  needed outside of the cities and since the coal tar, if it could be sold  at all, brought only a cent or two a gallon, how could the coke-makers  be expected to throw out their old bee-hive ovens and put in the  expensive retorts and towers necessary to the recovery of the  by-products? But within the last ten years the by-product ovens have  come into use and now nearly half our coke is made in them.    Although the products of destructive distillation vary within wide  limits, yet the following table may serve to give an approximate idea of  what may be got from a ton of soft coal:      1 ton of coal may give        Gas, 12,000 cubic feet        Liquor (Washings) ammonium sulfate (7-25 pounds)        Tar (120 pounds)  benzene (10-20 pounds)                          toluene (3 pounds)                          xylene  (1-1/2 pounds)                          phenol  (1/2 pound)                          naphthalene (3/8 pound)                          anthracene  (1/4 pound)                          pitch (80 pounds)        Coke (1200-1500 pounds)    When the tar is redistilled we get, among other things, the ten \"crudes\"  which are fundamental material for making dyes. Their names are:  benzene, toluene, xylene, phenol, cresol, naphthalene, anthracene,  methyl anthracene, phenanthrene and carbazol.    There! I had to introduce you to the whole receiving line, but now that  that ceremony is over we are at liberty to do as we do at a reception,  meet our old friends, get acquainted with one or two more and turn our  backs on the rest. Two of them, I am sure, you've met before, phenol,  which is common carbolic acid, and naphthalene, which we use for  mothballs. But notice one thing in passing, that not one of them is a  dye. They are all colorless liquids or white solids. Also they all have  an indescribable odor--all odors that you don't know are  indescribable--which gives them and their progeny, even when odorless,  the name of \"aromatic compounds.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Diagram of the products obtained from coal and  some of their uses.]    The most important of the ten because he is the father of the family is  benzene, otherwise called benzol, but must not be confused with  \"benzine\" spelled with an _i_ which we used to burn and clean our  clothes with. \"Benzine\" is a kind of gasoline, but benzene _alias_  benzol has quite another constitution, although it looks and burns the  same. Now the search for the constitution of benzene is one of the most  exciting chapters in chemistry; also one of the most intricate chapters,  but, in spite of that, I believe I can make the main point of it clear  even to those who have never studied chemistry--provided they retain  their childish liking for puzzles. It is really much like putting  together the old six-block Chinese puzzle. The chemist can work better  if he has a picture of what he is working with. Now his unit is the  molecule, which is too small even to analyze with the microscope, no  matter how high powered. So he makes up a sort of diagram of the  molecule, and since he knows the number of atoms and that they are  somehow attached to one another, he represents each atom by the first  letter of its name and the points of attachment or bonds by straight  lines connecting the atoms of the different elements. Now it is one of  the rules of the game that all the bonds must be connected or hooked up  with atoms at both ends, that there shall be no free hands reaching out  into empty space. Carbon, for instance, has four bonds and hydrogen only  one. They unite, therefore, in the proportion of one atom of carbon to  four of hydrogen, or CH_{4}, which is methane or marsh gas and obviously  the simplest of the hydrocarbons. But we have more complex hydrocarbons  such as C_{6}H_{14}, known as hexane. Now if you try to draw the  diagrams or structural formulas of these two compounds you will easily  get        H        H H H H H H      "]]]
