(#12)"],[1,"that Darwin's  \"theory turns the Creator--and his occasional intervention in the  revolutions of the earth and in the production of species--without any  hesitation out of doors, inasmuch as it does not leave the smallest room  for the agency of such a Being. The first living germ being granted, out  of it the creation develops itself progressively by natural selection,  through all the geological periods of our planets, by the simple law of  descent--no new species arises by creation and none perishes by divine  annihilation--the natural course of things, the process of evolution of  all organisms and of the earth itself, is of itself sufficient for the  production of all we see. Thus Man is not a special creation, produced  in a different way, and distinct from other animals, endowed with an  individual soul and animated by the breath of God; on the contrary, Man  is only the highest product of the progressive evolution of animal life  springing from the group of apes next below him.\"[28]    After this no one can be surprised to hear him say, that \"the pulpits of  the orthodox, the confessionals of the priests, the platforms of the  interior missions, the presidential chairs of the consistories, resound  with protestations against the assaults made by Materialism and  Darwinism against the very foundations of society.\" (p. 286) This he  calls \"Das Wehgeschrei der Moralisten\" (the Wail of the Moralists). The  designation Moralists is a felicitous one, as applied to the opponents  of Vogt and his associates. It distinguishes them as men who have not  lost their moral sense; who refuse to limit their faith to what can be  proved by the five senses; who bow to the authority of the law written  by the finger of God, on the hearts of men, which neither sophistry nor  wickedness can effectually erase. All Vogt thinks it necessary to reply  to these Moralists is, \"Lasst sie bellen, bis sie ausgebellt haben\" (Let  them bark till they are tired). \"Ende.\"    FOOTNOTE:    [28] _Vorlesungen ueber den Menschen, seine Stellung in der Schoepfung  und in der Geschichte der Erde_. Von Carl Vogt. Giessen, 1863, vol. ii.  p. 260.      _Haeckel._    Dr. Ernst Haeckel, Professor in the University of Jena, is said to stand  at the head of the living naturalists of Germany. His work on \"Natural  History of Creation\" contains a course of lectures delivered to the  professors, students, and citizens of Jena. It is, therefore, somewhat  popular in its character. The ability of the writer is manifest on every  page. The distinctness of his perceptions, precision of language,  perspicuity of style, and the strength of his convictions, give the  impression of a man fully master of his subject, who has thought himself  through, and is perfectly satisfied with the conclusions at which he has  arrived. At the same time it is the impression of a man who is developed  only on one side; who never looks within; who takes no cognizance of the  wonders revealed in consciousness; to whom the intuitions of reason and  of the conscience, the sense of dependence on a will higher than our  own--the sense of obligation and responsibility are of no account,--in  short a man to whom the image of God enstamped on the soul of man is  invisible. This being the case, he that is least in the kingdom of  heaven is greater than he.    Haeckel admits that the title of his book, \"Natural Creation,\" _i. e._  creation by natural laws, is a contradiction. He distinguishes,  however, between the creation of substance and the creation of form. Of  the former he says science knows nothing. To the scientist matter is  eternal. If any one chooses to assume that it was created by an  extramundane power, Haeckel says he will not object. But that is a  matter of faith; and \"where faith begins, science ends.\" The very  reverse of this is true. Science must begin with faith. It cannot take a  single step without it. How does Haeckel know that his senses do not  deceive him? How does he know that he can trust to the operations of his  intellect? How does he know that things are as they appear? How does he  know that the universe is not a great phantasmagoria, as so many men  have regarded it, and man the mere sport of chimeras? He must believe in  the laws of belief impressed on his nature. Knowledge implies a mind  that knows, and confidence in the act of knowing implies belief in the  laws of mind. \"An inductive science of nature,\" says President Porter,  \"presupposes a science of induction, and a science of induction  presupposes a science of man.\"[29] Haeckel, however, says faith is the  mere product of the poetic imagination; science, of the understanding;  if its conclusions come into conflict with the creations of the  imagination, the latter, of course, must give way.[30]    He says, there have ever been two conflicting theories of the universe:  the one, monistic; the other, dualistic. The one admits of only one  substance, matter; the other of two, matter and mind. He prefers to call  the former monism rather than materialism, because the latter term often  includes the idea of moral materialism, _i. e._ the doctrine that  sensual pleasure is the end of life; a doctrine, he says, much more  frequently held by princely church-men than by men of science. He  maintains, however, that \"all knowable nature is one; that the same  eternal, immutable (ehernen, brazen) laws are active in the life of  animals and plants, in the formation of crystals, and the power of  steam; in the whole sphere of biology, zooelogy, and botany. We have,  therefore, the right to hold fast the monistic and mechanical view,  whether men choose to brand the system as Materialism or not. In this  sense, all natural science, with the law of causation at its head, is  thoroughly materialistic.\" (p. 32)    The monistic theory he calls \"mechanical or causal,\" as distinguished  from the dualistic theory, which he calls \"teleological or vitalistic.\"  According to the latter, \"the vegetable and animal kingdoms are  considered as the products of a creative agency, working with a definite  design. In looking on an organism, the conviction seems unavoidable that  so skilfully constructed a machine, such a complicated working  apparatus, as an organism is, could be produced only by an agency  analogous to, although far more perfect than the agency of man.\" \"This,\"  he says, \"supposes the Creator to be an organism analogous to man,  although infinitely more perfect; who contemplates his formative powers,  lays the plan of the machine, and then, by the use of appropriate means,  produces an effect answering to the preconceived plan.... However highly  the Creator may be exalted, this view involves the ascription to Him of  human attributes, in virtue of which he can form a plan, and construct  organisms to correspond with it. That is the view to which Darwin's  doctrine is directly opposed, and of which Agassiz is, among  naturalists, the most important advocate. The famous work of Agassiz,  'Essay on Classification,' which is in direct opposition to Darwin's,  and appeared about the same time, has carried out logically to the  utmost the absurd anthropomorphic doctrine of a Creator.\" (p. 17)    The monistic theory is called \"mechanical and causal,\" because it  supposes that all the phenomena of the universe, organic and inorganic,  vegetable and animal, vital and mental, are due to mechanical or  necessarily operating causes (causae efficientes); just as the dualistic  theory is called \"teleological or vitalistic,\" because it refers natural  organisms to causes working for the accomplishment of a given end (causae  finales). (p. 67)    The grand difficulty in the way of the mechanical or monistic theory was  the occurrence of innumerable organisms, apparently at least, indicative  of design. To get over this difficulty, Haeckel says, some who could not  believe in a creative and controlling mind adopted the idea of a  metaphysical ghost called vitality. The grand service rendered by Darwin  to science is, that his theory enables us to account for the  appearances of design in nature without assuming final causes, or, a  mind working for a foreseen and intended end. \"All that had appeared  before Darwin,\" he says, \"failed to secure success, and to meet with  general acceptance of the doctrine of the mechanical production of  vegetable and animal organisms. This was accomplished by Darwin's  theory.\" (p. 20)    The precise difficulty which Mr. Darwin's doctrine has, according to  Haeckel, enabled men of science to surmount, is thus clearly stated on  p. 633. It is, \"that organs for a definite end should be produced by  undesigning or mechanical causes.\" This difficulty is overcome by the  doctrine of evolution. \"Through the theory of descent, we are for the  first time able to establish the monistic doctrine of the unity of  nature, that a mechanic-causal explanation of the most complicated  organisms, _e. g._ the formation and constitution of the organs of  sense, have no more difficulty for the common understanding, than the  mechanical explanation of any physical process, as, for example,  earthquakes, the direction of the winds, or the currents of the sea. We  thus arrive at the conviction of the last importance, that all natural  bodies with which we are acquainted are equally endowed with life  (gleichmaessig belebt sind); that the distinction between living and dead  matter does not exist. When a stone is thrown into the air and falls by  certain laws to the ground, or when a solution of salt forms a crystal,  the result is neither more nor less a mechanical manifestation of life,  than the flowering of a plant, the generation or sensibility of animals,  or the feelings or the mental activity of man. In thus establishing the  monistic theory of nature lies the highest and most comprehensive merit  of the doctrine of descent, as reformed by Darwin.\" (p. 21) \"As to the  much vaunted design in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],[0,"The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#12)"],[1,"from a photographed copy of the volume in  the British Museum:           *       *       *       *       *         \"We have succeeded in obtaining for our use from a man close to us,       now deceased, a manuscript in which are described with unusual       precision and clearness the course and progress of the universal       fatal mystery aiming to bring the apostate world to an inevitable       catastrophe. This manuscript was given to us about four years ago       (in 1901) with the assurance that it was an accurate copy--a       translation of the original documents stolen by a woman from one of       the most powerful and sacred directors of Freemasonry after one of       the secret meetings of the 'initiates' in France, the present nest       of the Freemason's sect. This manuscript under the general title       'Protocols of Meetings of the Wise Men of Zion' I now call to the       attention of all who wish to see or hear. These 'Protocols' at a       first cursory glance might seem to be what we are accustomed to       call truisms; they are more or less commonplaces although expressed       with a boldness and a hatred not altogether customary in       commonplaces. A proud, deeply-rooted, ancient, for a long time       secretly growing,--and what is more frightful than all,--a religious       rage boils between the lines, bubbling over and escaping from the       overfilled vessel of violence and vengeance, already approaching       complete triumph.         \"It must be mentioned, by the way, that the title of the manuscript       does not fully justify the contents: these are not protocols of a       meeting but rather the report of someone in power, divided into       parts which are not even always logically connected: the impression       remains that this is a fragment of something much more significant,       the beginning of which has been lost. The origin of the manuscript,       as given by us above, furnishes sufficient explanation of this.           *       *       *       *       *         \"We may perhaps be reproached, and justly, for the apocryphal       character of the document presented.

In the       complexity of the present criminally-earthly process _we must not       search for direct evidence_; we are forced to content ourselves       with indirect proof and of these it seems that the attention of the       sad Christian observer is fully satisfied.         \"The history of the Rothschilds show that the whole republican era       of France is due to Zion and that not a single one of those elected       to office has to this time ever done what he promised to do, if the       demands of his electors did not coincide with the plans of the       government of Zion.         \"What has become of unfortunate France!...         \"'Let him who has ears, listen!'\"           *       *       *       *       *         \"'Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some       shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and       doctrines of devils;         \"'Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a       hot iron;         \"'Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which       God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which       believe and know the truth.'         \"Is not this Tolstoy and his followers scattered over the whole       world?!\"           *       *       *       *       *         \"In every age there have been many women 'drowning in sin and led       on by various lusts': the ebb and flow of this sin in woman's heart       characterized whole epochs of particular human defection but at no       time of the seeming triumph of sin have there been women       'constantly studying'--this sign represents entirely a universal       inheritance and is an exclusive characteristic of our epoch.         \"Who is ignorant of the so-called 'woman question,' the       emancipation of woman, that has already succeeded in breaking up so       many families and which threatens an even greater disruption in the       future?!...         \"For the sake of some phantom the bride and mother abandons her       true mission.

C. E.--The \"Symbolic Snake\"--Universal Suffrage a Jewish Device--Every  Jew Familiar with Plot.      In the book issued by G. Butmi to which reference has been made, and  which contains the \"Rabbi's Speech\" already considered, there is to be  found still another version of the protocols. Butmi was a Black Hundred  writer. It appeared in 1907 and was dedicated to the Black Hundred  organization. Appropriately enough it was published by the Society of  Deaf and Dumb, as will be seen from the facsimile reproduction of the  title page. With exceeding _naivete_ Butmi published the forged speech  attributed by Retcliffe-Goedsche to a Jewish Rabbi as proof of the  genuineness of the protocols, and side by side with the fabricated  speech appears the Butmi version of the protocols which had undergone  further changes subsequent to the publication in 1905 of \"the documents\"  by Serge Nilus.    The headlines over the protocols in the Butmi 1907 version read as  follows:         \"PROTOCOLS TAKEN OUT OF THE SECRET DEPOSITORIES OF THE MAIN OFFICE       OF ZION.         \"'(Extracts from ancient and modern protocols of the Sages of Zion       of the Universal Organization of Freemasons.)'    Thus the Protocols were in 1907 presented by G. Butmi, dedicated to the  Black Hundreds, as Masonic, not as Jewish documents. In his introduction  the author says, in part, as follows:         \"'These secret protocols were secured with great difficulty in       fragmentary form, and were translated into Russian in December,       1901. It is almost impossible to get at the secret depositories       again where they are hidden, and therefore they cannot be       reinforced by definite information as to the place, day, month,       year, where and when they were composed.         \"'The reader who is more or less familiar with the secrets of       Freemasonry will draw from the general character of the criminal       plot, outlined in the protocols, the conclusion as to their       authenticity, and from several details he will suppose with great       certainty that the mentioned protocols were taken from the       documents of the Masonic lodge of Egyptian ritual, or Mizraim,       which is joined mostly "]]]
