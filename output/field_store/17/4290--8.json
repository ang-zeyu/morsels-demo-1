She wears a quaint little scarlet cap,  And a little green bowl she holds in her lap,  Filled with bread and milk to the brim,  And a wreath of marigolds round the rim:  \"Ha! ha!\" laughs little Gustava.    3.  Up comes her little gray, coaxing cat,  With her little pink nose, and she mews, \"What's that ?\"  Gustava feeds her,--she begs for more,  And a little brown hen walks in at the door:  \"Good day!\" cries little Gustava.    4.  She scatters crumbs for the little brown hen,  There comes a rush and a flutter, and then  Down fly her little white doves so sweet,  With their snowy wings and their crimson feet:  \"Welcome!\" cries little Gustava.    5.  So dainty and eager they pick up the crumbs.  But who is this through the doorway comes?

He would rarely pass people in the  street without being guilty of some sort of abuse.     THIRD READER.  159  2. If a person were well dressed he would cry out,  \"Dandy!\" If a person's clothes were dirty or torn, he would  throw stones at him, and annoy him in every way.  3. One afternoon, just as the school was dismissed, a  stranger passed through the village. His dress was plain and  somewhat old, but neat and clean. He carried a cane in his  hand, on the end of which was a bundle, and he wore a  broad-brimmed hat.  4. No sooner did James see the stranger, than he winked to  his playmates, and said, \"Now for some fun!\" He then  silently went toward the stranger from behind, and, knocking  off his hat, ran away.  5. The man turned and saw him, but James was out of  hearing before he could speak. The stranger put on his hat,  and went on his way. Again did James approach; but this  time, the man caught him by the arm, and held him fast.  6. However, he contented himself with looking James a  moment in the face, and then pushed him from him. No  sooner did the naughty boy find himself free again, than he  began to pelt the stranger with dirt and stones.     160  ECLECTIC SERIES.      7. But he was much frightened when the \"rowdy,\" as he  foolishly called the man, was struck on the head by a brick,  and badly hurt. All the boys now ran away, and James  skulked across the fields to his home.  8. As he drew near the house, his sister Caroline came out  to meet him, holding up     THIRD READER.  161  a beautiful gold chain and some new books for him to see.  9. She told James, as fast as she could talk, that their  uncle, who had been away several years, had come home,  and was now in the house; that he had brought beautiful  presents for the whole family; that he had left his carriage at  the tavern, a mile or two off, and walked on foot, so as to  surprise his brother, their father.  10. She said, that while he was coming through the  village, some wicked boys threw stones at him, and hit him  just over the eye, and that mother had bound up the wound.  \"But what makes you look so pale?\" asked Caroline,  changing her tone.  11. The guilty boy told her that nothing was the matter  with him; and running into the house, he went upstairs into  his chamber. Soon after, he heard his father calling him to  come down. Trembling from head to foot, he obeyed. When  he reached the parlor door, he stood, fearing to enter.  12. His mother said, \"James, why do you not come in?  You are not usually so bashful. See this beautiful watch,  which your uncle has brought for you.\"  3, 11.     162  ECLECTIC SERIES,  13. What a sense of shame did James now feel! Little  Caroline seized his arm, and pulled him into the room. But  he hung down his head, and covered his face with his hands.  14. His uncle went up to him, and kindly taking away his  hands, said, \"James, will you not bid me welcome?\" But  quickly starting back, he cried, \"Brother, this is not your son.  It is the boy who so shamefully insulted me in the street!\"  15. With surprise and grief did the good father and mother  learn this. His uncle was ready to forgive him, and forget the  injury. But his father would never permit James to have the  gold watch, nor the beautiful books, which his uncle had  brought for him.  16. The rest of the children were loaded with presents.  James was obliged to content himself with seeing them  happy. He never forgot this lesson so long as he lived. It  cured him entirely of his low and insolent manners.         THIRD READER.  163    LESSON LXIII.    WE ARE SEVEN.    1. I met a little cottage girl:  She was eight years old, she said;  Her hair was thick with many a curl,  That clustered round her head.    2. She had a rustic, woodland air,  And she was wildly clad:  Her eyes were fair, and very fair;--  Her beauty made me glad.    3. \"Sisters and brothers, little maid,  How many may you be?\"  \"How many? Seven in all,\" she said,  And, wondering, looked at me.    4. \"And where are they? I pray you tell.\"  She answered, \"Seven are we;  And two of us at Conway dwell,  And two are gone to sea.     l64 ECLECTIC SERIES.    5. \"Two of us in the churchyard lie,  My sister and my brother;  And, in the churchyard cottage, I  Dwell near them with my mother,\"        6. \"You say that two at Conway dwell,  And two are gone to sea,  Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,  Sweet maid, how this may be.\"     THIRD READER.  165    7. Then did the little maid reply,  \"Seven boys and girls are we;  Two of us in the churchyard lie,  Beneath the churchyard tree.\"    8. \"You run about, my little maid,  Your limbs, they are alive;  If two are in the churchyard laid,  Then ye are only five.\"    9. \"Their graves are green, they may be seen,\"  The little maid replied,  \"Twelve steps or more from mother's door,  And they are side by side.    10. \"My stockings there I often knit,  My kerchief there I hem;  And there upon the ground I sit,  And sing a song to them.    11. \"And often after sunset, sir,  When it is light and fair,  I take my little porringer,  And eat my supper there.    12. \"The first that died was sister Jane;  In bed she moaning lay,    166  ECLECTIC SERIES.    Till God released her from her pain;  And then she went away.    13. \"So in the churchyard she was laid;  And, when the grass was dry,  Together round her grave we played,  My brother John and I.    14. \"And when the ground was white with snow,  And I could run and slide,  My brother John was forced to go,  And he lies by her side.\"    15. \"How many are you, then?\" said I,  \"If they two are in heaven?\"  Quick was the little maid's reply,  \"O master! we are seven.\"    16. \"But they are dead; those two are dead!  Their spirits are in heaven!\"  'T was throwing words away: for still  The little maid would have her will,  And said, \"Nay, we are seven.\"  William Wordsworth.           THIRD READER.  167    LESSON LXIV.    MARY'S DIME.  1. There! I have drawn the chairs into the right corners,  and dusted the room nicely. How cold papa and mamma will  be when they return from their long ride! It is not time to  toast the bread yet, and I am tired of reading.  2. What shall I do? Somehow, I can't help thinking about  the pale face of that little beggar girl all the time. I can see  the glad light filling her eyes, just as plain as I did when I  laid the dime in her little dirty hand.  3. How much I had thought of that dime, too! Grandpa  gave it to me a whole month ago, and I had kept it ever since  in my red box upstairs; but those sugar apples looked so  beautiful, and were so cheap--only a dime apiece--that I  made up my mind to have one.  4. I can see her--the beggar girl, I mean--as she stood  there in front of the store, in her old hood and faded dress,  looking at the candies laid all in a row. I wonder    168  ECLECTIC SERIES.  what made me say, \"Little girl, what do you want?\"  5. How she stared at me, just as if nobody had spoken  kindly to her before. I guess    she thought I was sorry for her, for she said, so earnestly and  sorrowfully, \"I was thinking how good one of those  gingerbread rolls would taste. I have n't had anything to eat  to-day.\"     THIRD READER.  169  6. Now, I thought to myself, \"Mary Williams, you have  had a good breakfast and a good dinner this day, and this  poor girl has not had a mouthful. You can give her your  dime; she needs it a great deal more than you do.\"  7. I could not resist that little girl's sorrowful, hungry  look--so I dropped the dime right into her hand, and, without  waiting for her to speak, walked straight away. I'm so glad I  gave her the dime, if I did have to go without the apple lying  there in the window, and looking just like a real one.        LESSON LXV.

All the same, I would not dog Acton's  footsteps quite so much.\"    \"He's a monitor.\"    \"Who'll make you useful. Take my word for it.\"    \"We'll see.\"    \"Oh! Certainly we shall.\"    Jack was thoroughly unhinged by his brother's dry bantering tone, and  said hotly--    \"I cannot understand, Phil, why he didn't get his cap. He deserved it.\"    \"There's no need for you to understand it, young 'un.\"    \"My opinion is----\"    \"Not worth the breath you're going to waste.\"    \"It's considered a shame pretty generally.\"    \"I've heard so; but, still, that does not alter matters. However, I did  not want to talk politics with you, Jack. Don't put your innocent little  toes into any scrape--that is all I wanted to tell you. Here is half a  crown for you to buy butterscotch, and while you're sucking it think over  what I've said. What! Little boys given up toffee? Then I'd better say  good night, Jack.\" Jack went out pretty sore.    About a week or so after this, Acton and young Bourne sped down to the  old Lodestone Farm, and as they pedalled in at the gate young Hill, the  farmer's son, said to Acton--    \"The man's been here since twelve, sir.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Acton. \"Has he got the stable ready?\"    \"He's been putting it to rights the last hour.\"    \"I say, Bourne,\" said Acton, turning to Jack, \"ever heard of the Alabama  Coon?\"    \"The fellow who won that fight in Holland? The prize-fighter?\"    \"The very same.\"    \"Rather!\"    \"Well, I've engaged him to give me a few lessons here. I'm going to try  for the Heavy at Aldershot. Like to see the fun?\"    \"Rather!\"    \"Then come along.\"    Together they went into the stable, and therein found \"The Coon,\" a  coal-black negro, busily shovelling sand upon the floor, smoking an  enormous cigar the while.    \"Making ready the cockpit,\" said Acton to Jack, who was staring open-eyed  at the worker. \"Lusty looking animal, eh?\"    \"My aunt!\" said Jack.    \"Hallo, Coon, you're about ready!\"    \"Yaas, sir,\" said the negro. \"I'm almost through.\"    \"Brought the mittens with you, too?\"    \"Yaas, sir, I have the feather beds.\"    \"Then when you've peeled we'll start.\"    The Coon put down his spade and slipped behind a stall.    \"You see, young 'un, the sergeant at the gym is a good old hand, but he  is an old hand, so to speak--hasn't got the polish. Seeing that at  Aldershot they tie us down to a very few rounds, if St. Amory's have to  make any show at all they must get all the points they can first round or  so. That's why I've got the Coon down here. He is the most scientific  boxer we have.\"    \"The figure will be pretty stiff, Acton, eh?\"    \"No matter about that if I can beat Jarvis. By the way, Bourne, you need  not say anything about this to any one. I have particular reasons for  keeping this quiet.\"    \"All serene. I'm mum, of course.\"    \"Thanks. You watch the Coon, and you'll pick up no end of wrinkles.\"    The Coon came out from behind the stall dressed in a vest, trousers, and  thin boots; his black arms were bare, and he had exchanged his cigar for  a straw, which he chewed vigorously. Acton changed his shoes and took off  his coat, and the lesson began.    Acton's opinion of the Coon's knowledge was, in Jack's mind, absolutely  corroborated by the display. His marvellous parrying of Acton's  attentions; his short step inwards, which invariably followed a mis-hit  by Acton; his baits to lure his opponent to deliver himself a gift into  his hands; his incredible ducking and lightning returns, held Bourne  fascinated. Everything was done so easily, so lithely, so lightly, and so  surely, that Jack gasped in admiration. Acton in the hands of the nigger  was a lamb indeed.    \"This is an eye-opener,\" said Jack. \"I'll try that left feint on Rogers,  the cocky ass!\"    The negro stopped now and then to show Acton where and how to avail  himself of opportunities; and Acton, who was in grim earnest, applied  himself whole-heartedly to the business in hand, and, in consequence, as  Jack afterwards told us, \"you could almost hear old Acton travelling on  the right road.\"    After about half an hour of instruction, Acton said--    \"That is enough of jawing for the afternoon, Coon. Let us have three  rounds to finish up with. Take the time, young 'un.\"    Jack, with immense pride, took out his watch and prepared to act as  timekeeper.    \"Better take it easily first two, sir, and put in all you know for the  last. A little hurricane in the third round is my advice.\"    Jack had an ecstatic ten minutes, the final round putting him in the  seventh heaven of enjoyment.    \"All I could make out was Acton's white arms mixed with Alabama's black  ones, and the sand flying in all directions. Stunning isn't the word for  it!\"    As Acton and young Bourne pedalled leisurely home for roll call, Jack  said--    \"I think Jarvis' chance of collaring the Heavy for his place is a trifle  'rocky.'\"    \"I hope so.\"    \"Crumbs! How Alabama does get home!\"          CHAPTER XI    TODD PAYS THE BILL      Another youth had come back to St. Amory's with resolutions as fixed and  steady, though more legitimate than Acton's. Augustus Vernon Robert Todd  returned to school with pockets more scantily lined than ever from the  parental source, with his mind constantly fixed on the conversation which  he had had with his house-master on that awful concluding day last term,  and his chin still thrust out valiantly. Gus's square chin meant an  undeviating attention to serious study, and Gus, armed _cap-a-pie_,  against all his old friends.    For Todd had taken his precautions. His watch--a gold one, \"jewelled in  numberless holes,\" as its owner pathetically remarked--had been left with  the family jeweller for three bright golden sovereigns, an eight-and-six  brass turnip, which went jolly well, although its tick was a trifle  vigorous under Gus's pillow, and an agreement. This document, drawn up by  himself, Gus regarded as a very masterpiece of business-like acumen. Gus  could have his gold watch back again within the year by paying three  sovereigns, and buying the brass turnip for half a sovereign, the profit  accruing on this latter transaction being, as Gus explained proudly, the  jeweller's percentage on the loan. The family jeweller had informed Gus  casually that he couldn't keep a wife and growing family on such  percentages, but to oblige, etc.    Todd received Mr. James Cotton blandly and politely, and Jim, in his  heavy way, mistook this airiness for non-paying symptoms on Gus's part.    \"Had a good time, old cock, during the holidays?\"    \"Beastly,\" said Gus.    \"Governor rusty?\"    \"No end. Been making the will again, and leaving me out.\"    \"Perry _fiasco_, eh?\"    \"Yes, and other things.\"    \"Well, I hope you can pay up all you owe me, old chap.\"    \"Oh yes!\" said Gus. \"I said I would keep my word, although you were so  good as to have your doubts.\"    \"All right, glad you can manage it.\"    \"Here you are,\" said Gus, thrusting his hand into his pocket and bringing  up his coins. \"Three three for that rotten bet, and the other fifteen bob  I owed you. It's all there.\"    Cotton opened his eyes.    \"You said the governor was rusty, Gus?\"    \"So he was, beastly; but I can pay you all the same.\"    \"Well,\" said Cotton, after a little awkward pause, \"I don't want to clean  you out quite, so pay half now and the rest next term. Would that suit  you better, Gus?\"    \"Thanks, I don't mind,\" said Gus, airily. \"Here's half, then.\"    Cotton left his friend's room considerably puzzled, but when he came next  night with his books for his old jackal's attentions as before, he was  more than puzzled, for Gus said--    \"Can give you half an hour, Jim.\"    \"We won't be able to screw up enough for Merishall in that time, old  man.\"    \"Then you'll have to do the rest yourself, Jim. I'm not going to piffle  about any more.\"    \"Oh, don't be an ass, Gus! I've heard that footle before,\" said Cotton,  with his heavy selfishness.    \"Not quite, for this time I mean what I say.\"    \"Oh no, you don't!\"    \"Oh yes, I do!\"    \"You wouldn't leave a fellow in the lurch like this, after all I--\"    \"I was left in the lurch last term, Jim, dear, and I'd rather you had a  taste of it this go. Do you remember when old Corker was savaging me  before all the school!\"    The ghost of a smile flitted over Cotton's lips as he said--    \"Rather!\"    \"The entire school, from the meanest fag up to Carr, was laughing at me,  and, by Jove! Jim, your laugh was the loudest and longest.\"    \"It was your tips I was thinking of, and Corker's frothing through your  list of names,\" said Cotton, apologetically.    \"All right,\" said Todd, acidly. \"If you had left me alone I wouldn't have  wanted those tips, and as for my names, I did not christen myself. If you  want half an hour to shake out your work roughly I'll do it, but I can't  do more, Jim, honour bright.\"    \"I don't want _that_!\" said Cotton, angrily, gathering up his  books.    \"Am deucedly glad you don't. And here, Jim, is the other half of the  money. Since I'm not obliging you in any way, why should you me?\"    \"You're logical, Todd, at any rate,\" said Jim, with half a sneer.    \"Didn't know you could spot logic when you heard it, Cotton,\" said Gus,  with an equal amount of acid, and yet good-naturedly too.    \"I suppose I clean you out?\"    \"You do. I've got a shilling to look at when you've taken up that heap.\"    \"Is that your last word?\"    \"It is, but there's no need to quarrel--we're as we were before I began  to take your hire, Jim.\"    \"Not quite,\" said Cotton, who was hit by Gus's decision. \"I'll leave you  to your odd shilling and your forsaken tips.\"    He stumped off to his own room, and called Todd pet names till bedtime.  What made Cotton so angry was that, deep down in his own mind, he knew  that Gus was about to do a sensible and a manly thing, and just because  he himself was going to"]]]
