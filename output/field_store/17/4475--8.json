After the material came the spiritual revival; the whole life of the  Middle Ages awoke on the conversion of the Northern nations and of  Hungary; but in the abundant and brilliant energy of the eleventh, the  twelfth, the thirteenth centuries, we must recognise the offspring of  the irrepressible Norsemen as well as of the Irish and Frank and English  missionaries, who in the Dark Ages of Christendom were working out the  empire of Innocent III.    In exploration, especially, it was true that theory followed  achievement. Flavio Gioja, of Amalphi, did not apply the magnet to  navigation--did not \"give sailors the use of the magnet\"--till  navigation itself had begun to venture into the unknown Atlantic. The  history of geographical advance in the earlier Middle Ages is thus  rather a chronicle of adventure than of science.    But the Norse discoveries are not only the first, they are the leading  achievements of Western travel and enterprise in the true Unknown,  between the time of Constantine and the Crusades. The central fact of  European expansion in the Dark Ages (from the seventh to the eleventh  century) is the advance of the Vikings to the Arctic Continent and to  America about the year 1000. All that precedes this on the same line is  doubtful and unimportant. For, of the other voyages to the West in the  sixth, the eighth, the tenth centuries, which, on Columbus' success,  turned into prior claims to the finding of the New World, there is not  one that deserves notice.    St. Brandon in 565, the Seven Spanish Bishops in 734, the Basques in 990  may or may not have sighted their islands of \"Antillia,\" of \"Atlantis,\"  of the \"Seven Cities.\" They cannot be verified or valued, any more than  the journeys of the Enchanted Horse or the Third Calendar. We only know  for certain a few unimportant, half-accidental facts, such as the visits  of Irish hermits to Iceland and the Faeroes during the eighth century,  and the traces of their cells and chapels--in bells and ruins and  crosses--found by the Northmen in the ninth.    It was in 787 that the Vikings first landed in England; by the opening  of the next century they were threatening the whole coast line of  Christendom, from Gallicia to the Elbe; in 874 they began to colonise  Iceland; in 877 they sighted Greenland; in 922 Rolf the Ganger won his  \"Normandy\" from Charles the Simple, by the Treaty of Clair-sur-Epte; as  early as 840 was founded the first Norse or Ostman kingdom in Ireland,  and in 878 the Norse earldom of the Orkneys, while about the same time  the first Vikings seem to have reached the White Sea and the extreme  North of Europe.    This advance is almost as rapid as that of the early Saracens; within a  hundred years from the first disturbance of Danes and Northmen by the  growing, all-including power of the new national kingdoms,--within three  generations from Halfdan the Black,--first the flying rebels, and then  the royalists in pursuit of them, had reached the farthest western and  northern limits of the known world, from Finisterre in \"Spanland\" to  Cape Farewell in Greenland, from the North Cape in Finland to the  Northwest Capes of \"Irland,\" from Novgorod or \"Holmgard\" in Russia to  \"Valland,\" between the Garonne and the Loire.    The chief lines of Northern advance were three--by the north-west,  south-west, and north-east, but each of these divided, after a time,  with important results.    The first sea-path, running by Caithness, Orkneys, Shetlands, and  Faeroes, reached Iceland, Greenland, and at last Vinland on the North  American Continent; but from the settlements on the coasts and islands  of northern Scotland, a fresh wave of pirate colonists swept down  south-west into the narrow seas of St. George's Channel and beat upon  the east and north and south of Ireland and the western coasts of  England and of \"Bretland.\"    The second invasion ran along the North German coast, and on reaching  the Straits of Dover, fell upon both sides of the English Channel,  according as the resistance was stronger or weaker in Wessex or in  Frankland. The advanced guard reunited with Ostmen and Orkneyers in the  Scilly Isles, and in Cornwall, and pressed on to the plunder of the Bay  of Biscay and its coasts. The most restless of all were not long in  finding out the wealth of the Moslem Caliphate of Cordova, and trying to  force their way up the Douro and the Tagus.    The expansion on this side was not to stop till it had founded, from the  Norman colony on the Seine, a Norman kingdom of England, and a dominion  in the Two Sicilies, but this was the work of the eleventh century, the  time of organisation and settled empire.    On the third side of northern expansion, to east and north-east, there  were two separate roads from the first; one taking the Baltic for its  track, and dividing northwards to Finland, up the Gulf of Bothnia,  eastwards to Russia and Novgorod (\"Gardariki\" and \"Holmgard\"), the other  coasting along \"Halogaland\" to Biarmaland, along Lapland to Perm and the  Archangel of later time.    Of these three lines of movement by far the most vital to our subject is  the first, which is also the earliest; the second, to south and  south-west, hardly gives any direct results for our story; and the  third, to east and north, is mainly concerned with Russian history.  While King Alfred was yet unborn, Norse settlements had been permanently  founded in the outlying points, coasts, and islands of Scotland and  Ireland, and in the years of his boyhood, about 860, Nadodd the Faeeroe  Jarl sighted Iceland, which had been touched at by the Irish monks in  795 but was now to be first added as a lasting gain to Europe, as a new  country, \"Snowland\"--something more than a hermitage for religious  exiles from the world. Four years later (in 864) Gardar the Swede  reached this new Ultima Thule, and re-named it from himself \"Gardar's  Holm.\" Yet another Viking, Raven Floke, followed the track of the first  explorer in 867, before Iceland got its final name and earliest  colonisation from the Norsemen Ingolf and Leif and the sheep-farmers of  the Faeroes in 874, the third year of Alfred's reign in Wessex.    [Illustration: THE ANGLO-SAXON MAP. (SEE LIST OF MAPS)]    Three years later, 877-8, at the very time of the farthest Danish  advance in England, when Guthrum had driven the English King into the  Isle of Athelney, the Norsemen reached their farthest point of northern  advance in Europe; Gunnbiorn sighted a new land to the north-west, which  he called \"White Shirt,\" from its snow-fields, and which Red Eric a  century later re-named Greenland--\"for there is nothing like a good name  to attract settlers.\" By this the Old World had come nearer than ever  before to the discovery of a new one.    Geographically, this side of the Arctic Continent falls to the share of  North America, and once its fiords had been made in their turn centres  of colonisation and of further progress, the actual reaching of  Newfoundland and Cape Cod was natural enough. The real voyage lay  between Cape Farewell and the European mainland; it was a stormy and  dangerous passage from the Greenland Bays to Labrador, but not a long  one, and, as far as can be judged from scanty records, neither so cold  nor so icebound as at present.    But exploration had outrun settlement. It was not till 986, more than  one hundred years after Gunnbiorn's discovery, that Eric the Red, one of  the chiefs of the Iceland colonists, led a band of followers and  friends into a permanent exile in the unknown land. The beginnings of  several villages were made in the next few years, and the first American  discoveries followed at once. About 989 one Bjarni Herjulfson, following  his father from Iceland to Eric's Fiord in Greenland, was driven west by  storms first to a flat, well-wooded country, then to a mountainous  island, covered with glaciers. He bore away with a fresh breeze and  reached his home in Eric's Fiord in four days.    But his report aroused great interest; the time had come, and the men,  and Norse rovers, who after so much in the past were ready to dare  anything in the future, eagerly volunteered to follow up the new route;  Bjarni himself visiting Norway and telling his story, was blamed for his  slackness, and when he went back to Greenland there was \"much talk of  finding unknown lands.\" In the year 1000 Leif, a son of Red Eric,  started with a definite purpose of discovery. He bought Bjarni's ship,  manned it with five and twenty men and put out. First they came to the  land Bjarni had sighted last, and went on shore. There was no grass to  be seen, but great snowy ridges far inland, \"and all the way from the  coast to these mountains was one field of snow, and it seemed to them a  land of no profit,\"--so they left, calling it Helluland, or Slate-land,  perhaps the Labrador of the sixteenth century.    They put to sea again and found another land, flat and wooded, with a  white sand shore, low-lying towards the sea. This, said Leif, we will  call after its nature, Markland (Woodland). Thence driving for two days  before a north-east wind, they came to an island, where they landed to  wait for good weather. They tasted the dew on the grass and thought they  had never known anything so sweet. Sailing on again into a sound between  the island and a ness, they reached a place where a river came out of a  lake; into this they towed the ship and anchored, carrying their beds  out on the shore and setting up their tents, with a large hut in the  middle, and made all ready for wintering there.    There was no want of fish food--\"the largest salmon in the lake they had  ever seen\"--and the country seemed to them so good that they would need  no fodder for cattle in the winter.

The  noble animal did not chastise them in the manner he might have done, and  seemed to think they were too contemptible to be angry with them. But he  took other means to punish them for their cruelty. He filled his trunk  with water of a dirty quality, and advancing toward them in his ordinary  manner, spouted the whole of the puddle over them. The punishment was  highly applauded by those who witnessed it, and the poor cobblers were  laughed at for their pains.          [Illustration: THE LION.]    The Lion.      I have read a thrilling story of a poor Hottentot, who was sent to take  his master's cattle to water at a pool not far off from the house. When  he came to the watering-place, he perceived that a huge lion was lying  there, apparently bathing himself. He immediately ran, with the greatest  terror, through the midst of the herd of cattle, hoping the lion would  be satisfied with one of the cattle, and allow him to escape. He was  mistaken, however. The lion dashed through the herd, and made directly  after the man. Throwing his eyes over his shoulder, he saw that the  furious animal had singled him out. Not knowing what else to do to get  clear of his enemy, he scrambled up an aloe-tree, that happened to be  near. At that very moment the lion made a spring at him, but  unsuccessfully, and fell to the ground. There was in the tree a cluster  of nests of the bird called the sociable grosbeak; and the Hottentot hid  himself among these nests, in hopes that he could get out of the lion's  sight, and that the beast would leave him. So he remained silent and  motionless for a great while, and then ventured to peep out of his  retreat. To his surprise, he perceived that he was still watched. In  this way, he was kept a prisoner for more than twenty-four hours, when,  at last, the lion, parched with thirst, went to the pool to drink, and  the Hottentot embraced the opportunity to come down, and run home as  fast as his legs would carry him.    There is a thrilling anecdote told of a settler in the back districts of  the Cape of Good Hope, who was a hunter. Returning, one day, with some  friends, from an excursion, they suddenly came upon two large full-grown  lions. Their horses were already jaded, and the utmost consternation for  a moment seized them. They immediately saw that their only hope of  safety lay in separation. They started in somewhat different directions,  at the top of their speed, holding their rifles on the cock. Those who  were most lightly loaded made good way, but the third was left behind,  and, as his companions disappeared below the brow of a hill, the two  beasts came directly after him. He quickly loosed a deer which was tied  to his saddle, but the prey was not sufficient to distract them from  their purpose. Happily, as is the custom, both barrels of his piece were  loaded with ball--a most timely precaution in that country--and he was a  good marksman. Turning for a moment, he leveled his gun with as much  precision as at such a time he could command, and fired. He waited not  for the result, but again scampered off as quickly as his horse could  carry him, but he heard a deep, short, and outrageous roar. The ball was  afterward found to have entered the animal's breast, and lodged in his  back. His work, however, was but half done. The time he had lost  sufficed to bring the other within reach, and, with a tremendous bound,  he leaped upon the horse's back, lacerating it in a dreadful manner, but  missed his hold, for the poor creature, mad with agony and fear, kicked  with all his force, and hurried forward with increased rapidity. A  second attempt was more successful, and the hunter was shaken from his  seat; the horse, however, again escaped.    The poor fellow gave himself up for lost, but he was a brave man, and he  determined not to die without every attempt to save his life should  fail. Escape he saw was hopeless; so planting himself with the energy of  despair, he put his rifle hastily to his shoulder, and just as the lion  was stooping for his spring, he fired. He was a little too late; the  beast had moved, and the ball did not prove so effective as he hoped. It  entered the side of the wild beast, though it did him no mortal harm,  and he leaped at his victim. The shot had, nevertheless, delayed his  bound for an instant, and the hunter avoided its effect by a rapid jump,  and with the butt-end of his gun struck at the lion with all his power,  as he turned upon him. The dreadful creature seized it with his teeth,  but with such force, that instead of twisting it out of the hunter's  hand, he broke it short off by the barrel. The hunter immediately  attacked him again, but his weapon was too short, and the lion fixed his  claws in his breast, tearing off all his flesh, and endeavored to gripe  his shoulder with his mouth, but the gun-barrel was of excellent  service. Driving it into the mouth of the beast with all his strength,  he seized one of the creature's jaws with his left hand, and, what with  the strength and energy given by the dreadful circumstances, and the  purchase obtained by the gun-barrel, he succeeded in splitting the  animal's mouth. At the same time they fell together on their sides, and  a struggle for several minutes ensued upon the ground. Blood flowed  freely in the lion's mouth, and nearly choked him. His motions were thus  so frustrated that the hunter was upon his feet first, and, aiming a  blow with all his might, he knocked out one of the lion's eyes. He  roared terrifically with pain and rage, and, during the moments of delay  caused by the loss of his eye, the hunter got behind him, and, animated  by his success, hit him a dreadful stroke on the back of the neck, which  he knew was the most tender part. The stroke, however, appeared to have  no effect, for the lion immediately leaped at him again; but, it is  supposed from a defect of vision occasioned by the loss of his eye,  instead of coming down upon the hunter, he leaped beside him, and shook  his head, as if from excess of pain. The hunter felt his strength  rapidly declining, but the agony he endured excited him, and thus gave  new power to strike the lion again across the eyes. The beast fell  backward, but drew the hunter with him with his paw, and another  struggle took place upon the ground. He felt that the gun-barrel was his  safeguard; and though it rather seemed to encumber his hands, he clung  tenaciously to it. Rising up from the ground in terrible pain, he  managed to thrust it into the throat of the lion with all his might.  That thrust was fatal; and the huge animal fell on his side, powerless.  The hunter dragged himself to a considerable distance, and then fell  exhausted and senseless. His friends shortly afterward returned to his  assistance.    A lion had broken into a walled inclosure for cattle, and had done  considerable damage. The people belonging to the farm were well assured  that he would come again by the same way. They therefore stretched a  rope directly across the entrance, to which several loaded guns were  fastened, in such a manner that they must necessarily discharge  themselves into the lion's body, as soon as he should push against the  cord with his breast. But the lion, who came before it was dark, and had  probably some suspicion of the cord, struck it away with his foot, and  without betraying the least alarm in consequence of the reports made by  the loaded pieces, went fearlessly on, and devoured the prey he had left  untouched before.    The strength of the lion is so prodigious, that a single stroke of his  paw is sufficient to break the back of a horse; and one sweep of his  tail will throw a strong man to the ground. Kolbein says, that when he  comes up to his prey, he always knocks it down dead, and seldom bites it  till the mortal blow has been given. A lion at the Cape of Good Hope  was once seen to take a heifer in his mouth; and though that animal's  legs dragged on the ground, yet he seemed to carry her off with as much  ease as a cat does a rat.    One of the residents in South Africa--according to the Naturalist's  History--shot a lion in the most perilous circumstances that can be  conceived. We must tell the story in his own words. \"My wife,\" he says,  \"was sitting in the house, near the door. The children were playing  around her. I was outside, busily engaged in doing something to a wagon,  when suddenly, though it was mid-day, an enormous lion came up and laid  himself quietly down in the shade, upon the very threshold of the door.  My wife, either stupefied with fear, or aware of the danger attending  any attempt to fly, remained motionless in her place, while the children  took refuge in her lap. The cry they uttered immediately attracted my  attention. I hastened toward the door; but my astonishment may well be  conceived, when I found the entrance to it barred in such a way.  Although the animal had not seen me, unarmed as I was, escape seemed  impossible; yet I glided gently, scarcely knowing what I meant to do, to  the side of the house, up to the window of my chamber, where I knew my  loaded gun was standing, and which I found in such a condition, that I  could reach it with my hand--a most fortunate circumstance; and still  more so, when I found that the door of the room was open, so that I  could see the whole danger of the scene. The lion was beginning to move,  perhaps with the intention of making a spring. There was no longer any  time to think. I called softly to the mother not to be alarmed; and,  invoking the name of the Lord, fired my piece. The ball passed directly  over the hair of my boy's head, and lodged in the forehead of the lion,  immediately above his eyes, which shot forth, as it were, sparks of  fire, and stretched him on the ground, so that he never stirred more.\"    Nothing is more common than for the keepers of wild beasts to play with"]]]
