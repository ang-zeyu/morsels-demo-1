[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14990"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement No. 819, September 12, 1891 (#12)"],[1," steel chain is said to be twice that of an  ordinary one, the price per length is little more than that of best  iron chains.    They are made in lengths of from 40 to 50 feet, being compressed from  a solid rolled steel bar, the section of which is shaped like a  four-pointed star. In the first place holes are pierced at intervals  down the length of the bar, thus determining the length of the several  links. Then the bar is notched between the holes so as to give the  external form of the links. The next step is \"flattening out,\" which  presses the links into shape on their inner side, but leaves the  openings still closed by a plate of metal. They are then stamped out  so as to round them up, and the metal inside them is punched out, and  the edges \"cleaned,\" or trimmed off. The links are now parted from one  another and stamped again, to insure equal thickness in all parts of  the chain. The only processes now to be gone through are dressing and  finishing. According to the die used, the shape of the links can be  varied to suit any required pattern. The lengths of chain thus made  are joined by spiral rings made of soft steel, the convolutions being  afterward hammered together till they become solid. A ring of this  description, 3/4 inch diameter, underwent a strain of 46,200 lb., that  is, 23 tons to the square inch, its elongation being 21 per cent.    These chains have passed satisfactorily the tests of the Bureau  Veritas, and both that association and Lloyd's have accepted their use  on the same conditions and under the same tests as ordinary chains.    So much for the general idea of punching steel chains. We will now  describe a recent invention by which superior steel chains are  produced, the author of which is Mr. Hippolyte Rongier, of Birmingham,  Eng. He says:    My invention has for its object the manufacture of weldless stayed  chains, whereof each link, together with its cross strut or stay, is  made of one piece of metal without any weld or joint; and the  invention consists in producing a chain of stayed links from a bar of  cruciform section by the consecutive series of punching, twisting and  stamping operations hereinafter described, the punching operations  being entirely performed on the metal when in the cold state.    Figs. 1 to 10 show the progressive stages in the manufacture of the  chain, and the remaining figures show the series of tools that are  employed.    The general method of operation of making stayed chains according to  my invention is so far similar to the methods heretofore proposed for  making unstayed chains from the bar of cruciform section that the  links are formed alternately out of the one and the other pair of  diametrically opposite webs of the rod, the links, when severed and  completed, being already enchained together at the time of their  formation. The successive operations differ, however, in many  important practical respects from those heretofore proposed, as will  appear from the following detailed description of the successive steps  in the process illustrated by Figs. 1 to 10.    I will distinguish the one pair of diametrically opposite webs of the  bar and the notches and mortises punched therein and the links formed  therefrom from the other pair by an index figure 1 affixed to the  reference letters appertaining thereto.    _a a_ are one pair of diametrically opposite webs, and _a' a'_ the  other pair of webs of the bar.    [Illustration: Figures 2_a-_b, 6_a_, 4_a-b_, 7 _a-b_ and 10 _a-b_                 MANUFACTURE OF WELDLESS CHAINS]    The first operation illustrated in Fig. 1 is to punch out of the edge  of one of the webs, _a_, a series of shallow notches, _b_, at equal  intervals apart, corresponding to the pitch of the links to be formed  out of that pair of webs and situated where the spaces will ultimately  be formed between the ends of that series of links. The notches are  made with beveled ends, and are no deeper than is absolutely necessary  (for the purpose of a guide stop in the subsequent operations, as  hereinafter described), so as to avoid, as far as possible, weakening  the bar transversely. This operation is repeated upon one of the pairs  of webs _a'_; but whereas in the first operation of notching the web  the \"pitch\" of the notches is determined by the feed mechanism, in  this second operation of notching the notches, _b_, cut in the web,  _a_, serve as guides to influence and compensate for any inaccuracy of  the feed mechanism, so that the second set of notches, _b'_, shall be  intermediate of and rigorously equidistant from the first set of  notches, _b_. This compensation is effected by the notches, _b_,  fitting on to a beveled stop on the bed of the punching tool by which  the notches, _b'_, are cut, the beveled ends of the notches, _b_,  causing the bar under the pressure of the punch to adjust itself in  the longitudinal direction (if necessary) sufficiently to rectify any  inaccuracy of feed. These notches, _b b'_, similarly serve as guides  to insure uniformity of spacing in the subsequent operations of  punching out the links.    The second operation (illustrated in Fig. 2) is to punch out of the  pair of opposite webs, _a a_, pairs of oblong mortises--two pairs, _c  c_, and one pair, _d d_. These three pairs of mortises (which might be  punched at separate operations, but are preferably punched at one  stroke of the press) are situated as close as possible up to the faces  of the other pairs of webs, _a' a'_, the pairs of mortises, _c c_,  being so spaced as to correspond in position to the eyes of the links  to be formed, to which they correspond approximately in form, while  the pair, _d_, correspond in position to the notches, _b_, and  therefore to the intervals by which the links formed out of the same  pair of webs, _a a_, will be separated when completed. This operation  is continued along the whole length of the pair of webs, _a_. It will  be observed that a considerable thickness of metal is left at _a*_  between the notches, _b_, and the mortises, _d_. This is of primary  importance and is one of the essential features of my method of  manufacture, inasmuch as by first punching out the mortises, _d_, the  subsequent removal of the metal from between the outer ends of the  links is greatly facilitated, while by leaving the solid metal, _a*_,  the transverse strength of the webs, _a a_, is not materially  diminished, so that when the operation of punching the mortises, _c_  and _d_, in the other pair of webs, _a'_, is performed the bar will  not be bent and crippled, as would inevitably be the case were the  whole of the metal opposite the notches, _b_, which is ultimately to  be removed, to be punched out at so early a stage of the manufacture.  The operation of punching the pairs of mortises, _c'_ and _d_, having  been repeated along the other pair of webs, _a'_, it will be observed  that like the notches, _b_, the mortises, _c d_, in the one pair of  webs alternate with those, _c' d'_, in the other pair of webs.    The third operation (illustrated in Fig. 3) is to elongate the  mortises, _c d_, and bring the mortises, _c c'_, more nearly to the  final form. This is performed by punches similar to but larger (in the  direction of the length of the rod) than those used in the second  operation.    The third operation, which is repeated upon both pairs of webs, _a a  a' a'_, may be considered as a second stage of the second operation,  it being preferable to punch out the mortises in two stages in order  to remove sufficient metal without unduly straining the bar.    The fourth operation (illustrated in Fig. 4) consists in roughly  shaping the ends of the links externally by punching out the portions,  _a*_, of the webs, _a_, between the links lying in the same plane or  formed out of the same pair of webs. This operation is repeated on the  other pair of webs, _a'_. Up to this point a continuous core of metal  has been left at the intersection of the two pairs of webs.    The fifth operation (illustrated in Fig. 5) consists in punching out  the portions, _e_, of the core at each side of the cross stay of the  link, so as to separate the cross stay from the outer ends of the  adjacent links. This operation is performed by removing a portion only  of the metal of the core which intervenes between the cross stay and  the outer ends of the adjacent links enchained with the link under  operation--that is to say, portions, _e*_, of the core are temporarily  left attached to the outer ends of the links in order to avoid  crippling or bending the bar, which might occur were the whole of this  metal, which is ultimately to be removed, to be punched out at once,  these portions, _e*_, being supported by the bed die in the operation  of punching out the spaces, _e_, as hereinafter described. This  operation having been repeated upon both pairs of webs, it will be  observed that the rod-like form of the chain is now only maintained by  the portion of the core at the points, _f_, where the inner side of  the eye or bow of one link is united with that of the next one. The  severing of these intervening portions of the core and the breaking up  of the rod into the constituent links of the chain constitute the  sixth operation.    The sixth operation (illustrated in Fig. 6) is performed by torsion,  and for this purpose one end of the rod is held fixed while the other  is twisted once or twice in opposite directions, until by fatigue of  the metal at the points, _f_, the whole of the links are severed  almost at the same instant, and a chain of roughly formed stayed links  is produced.    The seventh operation (illustrated in Fig. 7) is to remove the  superfluous projecting pieces of metal both from the inside and  outside of the ends of the links. For this purpose the two ends of  each link are operated on at the same time by two pairs of punches  corresponding to the outline of the ends of the link.

Like Knox, he  was insensible to the charms of Mary Stuart, and that is a  deficiency hard to forgive in a man. Yet who can deny that Elizabeth  only did to Mary as Mary would have done to her? The morality of the  Guises was as much a part of Mary as her scholarship, her grace, her  profound statecraft, the courage which a voluptuous life never  imparted. Froude was not thinking of her, or of any woman. He was  thinking of England. Between the fall of Wolsey and the defeat of  the Armada was decided the great question whether England should be  Catholic or Protestant, bond or free. The dazzling Queen of Scots,  like the virtuous Chancellor and the holy Bishop, were on the wrong  side. Henry and Elizabeth, with all their faults, were on the right  one. That is the pith and marrow of Froude's book. Those who think  that in history there is no side may blame him. He followed Carlyle.  \"Froude is a man of genius,\" said Jowett: \"he has been abominably  treated.\" \"Il a vu iuste,\" said a young critic of our own day* in  reply to the usual charges of inaccuracy. The real object of his  attack was that ecclesiastical corruption which belongs to no Church  exclusively, and is older than Christianity itself.    --  * Arthur Strong.  --    The main portion of Froude's life for nearly twenty years was  occupied with his History of England from the fall of Wolsey to the  defeat of the Spanish Armada. It is on a large scale, in twelve  volumes. Every chapter bears ample proof of laborious study. Froude  neglected no source of information, and spared himself no pains in  pursuit of it. At the Record Office, in the British Museum, at  Hatfield, among the priceless archives preserved in the Spanish  village of Simancas, he toiled with unquenchable ardour and  unrelenting assiduity. Nine-tenths of his authorities were in  manuscript. They were in five languages. They filled nine hundred  volumes. Excellent linguist as he was, Froude could hardly avoid  falling into some errors. With his general accuracy as an historian  I shall have to deal in a later part of this book. Here I am only  concerned to prove that he took unlimited pains. He kept no  secretary, he was his own copyist, and he was not a good proof-  reader. Those natural blots, quas aut incuria fudit, aut humaria  parum cavit natura, are to be found, no doubt, in his pages.  From a  conscientious obedience to truth as he understood it, and a resolute  determination to present it as he saw it, he never swerved. He was  not a chronicler, but an artist, a moralist, and a man of genius.  Unless an historian can put himself into the place of the men about  whom he is writing, think their thoughts, share their hopes, their  aspirations, and their fears, he had better be taking a healthy walk  than poring over dusty documents. A paste-pot, a pair of scissors,  the mechanical precision of a copying clerk, are all useful in their  way; but they no more make an historian than a cowl makes a monk.    Polloi men narthekophoroi Bakchoi de te pauroi  [\"There are many officials, but few inspired.\" Zenobius, 5.77]    There are many writers of history, but very few historians. Froude  wrote with a definite purpose, which he never concealed from  himself, or from others. He believed, and he thought he could prove,  that the Reformation freed England from a cruel and degrading yoke,  that the things which were Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar,  and that the Church should be restricted within its own proper  sphere. Those, if such there be, who think that an historian should  have no opinions are entitled to condemn him. Those who simply  disagree with him are not. No man is hindered by any other cause  than laziness, incompetence, or more immediately profitable  occupations, from writing a history of the same period in exactly  the opposite sense.    Froude's earliest chapters were set in type, and distributed among a  few friends whose judgment he trusted. The most sympathetic was  Carlyle, who pronounced the introductory survey of England's social  condition at the opening of the sixteenth century to be just what it  ought to have been. Carlyle's marginal notes upon the first two  chapters are extremely interesting, and doubly characteristic,  because they illustrate at the same time his practical shrewdness  and his intense prejudice. For these reasons, and also because in  many instances his advice was followed, it may be worth while to  give some account of his pencil jottings, written when Carlyle's  hand was still firm, and as legible as they were fifty years ago.  Upon the first chapter as a whole, Carlyle's judgment, though  critical, was highly favourable.    \"This,\" he wrote, \"is a vigorous, sunny, calm, and wonderfully  effective delineation; pleasant to read; and bids fair to give much  elucidation to what is coming. Curious too as got mainly from good  reading of the Statutes at large! Might there be with advantage (or  not) some subdivision into sections, with headings, etc? Also, here  and there, some condensation of the excerpts given--condensation  into narrative where too longwinded? Item, for symmetry's sake (were  there nothing else) is not some outline of spiritual England a  little to be expected? Or will that come piece-meal as we proceed?  Hint, then, somewhere to that effect? Also remember a little that  there was an Europe as well as an England? In sum, Euge.\" Such  praise from such a man was balm to Froude's wounds and tonic to his  nerves. Practically expelled from his college, regarded by his own  family as almost a black sheep, he found himself taken up, and  treated as an equal, by a writer of European fame, whom of all his  contemporaries he most admired. In deference to Carlyle he rewrote  his opening paragraphs, and added useful dates. European history and  spiritual England do come into far greater prominence \"as we  proceed.\" The abbreviation and summary of extracts might, I think,  have been carried farther with advantage. But it is curious that  Froude was attacked for the precisely opposite fault of treating his  authorities with too much freedom. Carlyle, who knew what historical  labour was, saw at once that Froude dealt with his material as a  born student and an ardent lover of truth. His suggestions were  always excellent, as sound and just as they were careful and kind.  One criticism, which Froude disregarded, shows not only Carlyle's  wide knowledge (that appears throughout), but also that his long  residence south of the Tweed never made him really English. It  refers to Froude's description of the English volunteers at Calais  who \"were for years the terror of Normandy,\" and of Englishmen  generally as \"the finest people in all Europe,\" nurtured in profuse  abundance on \"great shins of beef.\"    \"This,\" says Carlyle, \"seems to me exaggerated; what we call John-  Bullish. The English are not, in fact, stronger, braver, truer, or  better than the other Teutonic races: they never fought better than  the Dutch, Prussians, Swedes, etc., have done. For the rest, modify  a little: Frederick the Great was brought up on beer-sops (bread  boiled in beer), Robert Burns on oatmeal porridge; and Mahomet and  the Caliphs conquered the world on barley meal.\"    David Hume would have thoroughly approved of this note. Froude's  patriotism was incorrigible, and he left the passage as it stood. A  little farther on Carlyle's hatred of political economy, in which  Froude fully shared, breaks out with amusing vigour. \"If,\" wrote the  younger historian, \"the tendency of trade to assume a form of mere  self-interest be irresistible,\" etc. \"And is it?\" comments the  elder. \"Let us all get prussic acid, then.\" A recent speculator  preferred cyanide of potassium. But if \"mere self-interest\"  comprises fraudulent balance-sheets, it cannot claim any support  from political economy. When Carlyle drew up a petition to the House  of Commons for amending the law of copyright, he was guided by self-  interest, but it was not a counsel of despair. The City Companies,  says Froude, \"are all which now remain of a vast organisation which  once penetrated the entire trading life of England--an organisation  set on foot to realise that impossible condition of commercial  excellence under which man should deal faithfully with his brother,  and all wares offered for sale, of whatever kind, should honestly be  what they pretend to be.\"    For \"impossible\" Carlyle proposed \"highly necessary, if highly  difficult,\" and a similar change was made. But why people who do not  understand political economy should be more honest than those who do  neither master nor disciple condescended to explain. It is much  easier to preach than to argue. More valuable than these gibes is  Carlyle's reminder that guilds were not peculiar to England.    \"In Lubeck, Augsburg, Nurnberg, Dantzig, not to speak of Venice,  Genoa, Pisa,--George Hudson and the Gospel of Cheap and Nasty were  totally unknown entities. The German Gilds even made poetry  together; Herr Sachs of Nurnberg was one of the finest pious genial  master shoemakers that ever lived anywhere--his shoes and rhymes  alike genuine (I can speak for the rhymes) and worthy.\"    It is strange that Carlyle should have taken the trouble to correct  a misquotation from Juvenal, and still stranger that Froude should  have left the words uncorrected. Misquotation was a too frequent  habit with him. In his second chapter he applies to Henry the famous  passage in Tacitus's character of Galba, and changes capax imperii  to dignus imperil, though dignus would have required imperio, and  would then have made inferior sense. Some of Carlyle's queries were  productive of really substantial results; for instance, the simple  words \"such as\" brought out the fact that the spoils of the  monasteries were in part devoted to national defence. \"Inveterate  frenzy\" is Froude's description of the years covered by the reign of  Edward IV. \"Fine healthy"]]]
