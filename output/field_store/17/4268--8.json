If you know  any one who is gay, beguiling and amusing, you will, if you are wise, do  everything you can to make him prefer your house and your table to any  other; for where he is, the successful party is also. What he says is of  no matter, it is the twist he gives to it, the intonation, the personality  he puts into his quip or retort or observation that delights his hearers,  and in his case the ordinary rules do not apply.    Eugene Field could tell a group of people that it had rained to-day and  would probably rain to-morrow, and make everyone burst into laughter--or  tears if he chose--according to the way it was said. But the ordinary rest  of us must, if we would be thought sympathetic, intelligent or agreeable,  \"go fishing.\"      =GOING FISHING FOR TOPICS=    The charming talker is neither more nor less than a fisherman.  (Fisherwoman rather, since in America women make more effort to be  agreeable than men do.) Sitting next to a stranger she wonders which \"fly\"  she had better choose to interest him. She offers one topic; not much of a  nibble. So she tries another or perhaps a third before he \"rises\" to the  bait.      =THE DOOR SLAMMERS=    There are people whose idea of conversation is contradiction and flat  statement. Finding yourself next to one of these, you venture:    \"Have you seen any good plays lately?\"    \"No, hate the theater.\"    \"Which team are you for in the series?\"    \"Neither. Only an idiot could be interested in baseball.\"    \"Country must have a good many idiots!\" mockingly.    \"Obviously it has.\" Full stop. In desperation you veer to the personal.    \"I've never seen Mrs. Bobo Gilding as beautiful as she is to-night.\"    \"Nothing beautiful about her. As for the name 'Bobo,' it's asinine.\"    \"Oh, it's just one of those children's names that stick sometimes for  life.\"    \"Perfect rot. Ought to be called by his name,\" etc.    Another, not very different in type though different in method, is the  self-appointed instructor whose proper place is on the lecture platform,  not at a dinner table.    \"The earliest coins struck in the Peloponnesus were stamped on one side  only; their alloy----\" etc.    Another is the expounder of the obvious: \"Have you ever noticed,\" says he,  deeply thinking, \"how people's tastes differ?\"    Then there is the vulgarian of fulsome compliment: \"Why are you so  beautiful? It is not fair to the others----\" and so on.      =TACTLESS BLUNDERERS=    Tactless people are also legion. The means-to-be-agreeable elderly man  says to a passee acquaintance, \"Twenty years ago you were the prettiest  woman in town\"; or in the pleasantest tone of voice to one whose only son  has married. \"Why is it, do you suppose, that young wives always dislike  their mothers-in-law?\"    If you have any ambition to be sought after in society you must not talk  about the unattractiveness of old age to the elderly, about the joys of  dancing and skating to the lame, or about the advantages of ancestry to  the self-made. It is also dangerous, as well as needlessly unkind, to  ridicule or criticize others, especially for what they can't help. If a  young woman's familiar or otherwise lax behavior deserves censure, a  casual unflattering remark may not add to your own popularity if your  listener is a relative, but you can at least, without being shamefaced,  stand by your guns. On the other hand to say needlessly \"What an ugly  girl!\" or \"What a half-wit that boy is!\" can be of no value except in  drawing attention to your own tactlessness.    The young girl who admired her own facile adjectives said to a casual  acquaintance: \"How _can_ you go about with that moth-eaten, squint-eyed,  bag of a girl!\" \"Because,\" answered the youth whom she had intended to  dazzle, \"the lady of your flattering epithets happens to be my sister.\"    It is scarcely necessary to say that one whose tactless remarks ride  rough-shod over the feelings of others, is not welcomed by many.      =THE BORE=    A bore is said to be \"one who talks about himself when you want to talk  about yourself!\" which is superficially true enough, but a bore might more  accurately be described as one who is interested in what does not interest  you, and insists that you share his enthusiasm, in spite of your  disinclination. To the bore life holds no dullness; every subject is of  unending delight. A story told for the thousandth time has not lost its  thrill; every tiresome detail is held up and turned about as a morsel of  delectableness; to him each pea in a pod differs from another with the  entrancing variety that artists find in tropical sunsets.    On the other hand, to be bored is a bad habit, and one only too easy to  fall into. As a matter of fact, it is impossible, almost, to meet anyone  who has not _something_ of interest to tell you if you are but clever  enough yourself to find out what it is. There are certain always  delightful people who refuse to be bored. Their attitude is that no  subject need ever be utterly uninteresting, so long as it is discussed for  the first time. Repetition alone is deadly dull. Besides, what is the  matter with trying to be agreeable yourself? Not _too_ agreeable. Alas!  it is true: \"Be polite to bores and so shall you have bores always round  about you.\" Furthermore, there is no reason why you should be bored when  you can be otherwise. But if you find yourself sitting in the hedgerow  with nothing but weeds, there is no reason for shutting your eyes and  seeing nothing, instead of finding what beauty you may in the weeds. To  put it cynically, life is too short to waste it in drawing blanks.  Therefore, it is up to you to find as many pictures to put on your blank  pages as possible.      =A FEW IMPORTANT DETAILS OF SPEECH IN CONVERSATION=    Unless you wish to stamp yourself a person who has never been out of  \"provincial\" society, never speak of your husband as \"Mr.\" except to an  inferior. Mrs. Worldly for instance in talking with a stranger would say  \"my husband,\" and to a friend, meaning one not only whom she calls by her  first name, but anyone on her \"dinner list,\" she says, \"Dick thought the  play amusing\" or \"Dick said----\". This does not give her listener the  privilege of calling him \"Dick.\" The listener in return speaks of her own  husband as \"Tom\" even if he is seventy--unless her hearer is a very young  person (either man or woman), when she would say \"my husband.\" Never \"Mr.  Older.\" To call your husband Mr. means that you consider the person you  are talking to, beneath you in station. Mr. Worldly in the same way speaks  of Mrs. Worldly as \"my wife\" to a gentleman, or \"Edith\" in speaking to a  lady. _Always._    In speaking about other people, one says \"Mrs.,\" \"Miss\" or \"Mr.\" as the  case may be. It is bad form to go about saying \"Edith Worldly\" or \"Ethel  Norman\" to those who do not call them Edith or Ethel, and to speak thus  familiarly of one whom you do not call by her first name, is unforgivable.  It is also effrontery for a younger person to call an older by her or his  first name, without being asked to do so. Only a very underbred,  thick-skinned person would attempt it.    Also you must not take your conversation \"out of the drawing-room.\"  Operations, ills or personal blemishes, details and appurtenances of the  dressing-room, for instance, are neither suitable nor pleasant topics, nor  are personal jokes in good taste.      =THE \"OMNISCIENCE\" OF THE VERY RICH=    Why a man, because he has millions, should assume that they confer  omniscience in all branches of knowledge, is something which may be left  to the psychologist to answer, but most of those thrown much in contact  with millionaires will agree that an attitude of infallibility is typical  of a fair majority.    A professor who has devoted his life to a subject modestly makes a  statement. \"You are all wrong,\" says the man of millions, \"It is this  way----\". As a connoisseur he seems to think that because he can pay for  anything he fancies, he is accredited expert as well as potential owner.  Topics he does not care for are \"bosh,\" those which he has a smattering  of, he simply appropriates; his prejudices are, in his opinion, expert  criticism; his taste impeccable; his judgment infallible; and to him the  world is a pleasance built for his sole pleasuring. But to the rest of us  who also have to live in it with as much harmony as we can, such persons  are certainly elephants at large in the garden. We can sometimes induce  them to pass through gently, but they are just as likely at any moment to  pull up our fences and push the house itself over on our defenseless  heads.    There are countless others of course, very often the richest of all, who  are authoritative in all they profess, who are experts and connoisseurs,  who are human and helpful and above everything respecters of the garden  enclosure of others.      =DANGERS TO BE AVOIDED=    In conversation the dangers are very much the same as those to be avoided  in writing letters. Talk about things which you think will be agreeable to  your hearer. Don't dilate on ills, misfortune, or other unpleasantnesses.  The one in greatest danger of making enemies is the man or woman of  brilliant wit. If sharp, wit is apt to produce a feeling of mistrust even  while it stimulates. Furthermore the applause which follows every witty  sally becomes in time breath to the nostrils, and perfectly  well-intentioned, people, who mean to say nothing unkind, in the flash of  a second \"see a point,\" and in the next second, score it with no more  power to resist than a drug addict can resist a dose put into his hand!    The mimic is a joy to his present company, but the eccentric mannerism of  one is much easier to imitate than the charm of another, and the subjects  of the habitual mimic are all too apt to become his enemies.    You need not, however, be dull because you refrain from the rank habit of  a critical attitude, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#12)"],[1,"replied, \"you will not be in want of money. Have you  anything more to ask?\"    No one spoke, and the silence that followed was interrupted by a loud  rustling of the wind. The darkness then lifted; but nothing was to be  seen--nothing save the trees and bushes, moon and stars.

As  we went all that way last night to oblige you, Leon, I think it is  only fair you should stand us treat. I'll bet you have some nickels  stowed away, somewhere, in those pockets of yours--it wouldn't be you  if you hadn't! What do you say, Matt?\"    \"I think as you do,\" Kelson replied. \"We've stood by Leon, he should  stand by us. How much have you, Leon?\"    \"How much have you?\" Curtis echoed, \"come, out with it--no jew-jewing  pals for me.\"    \"I might manage a dollar,\" Hamar said ruefully, as the prospect of a  good meal all to himself, at his favourite restaurant, faded away.  \"Where shall we go?\"    Just then, Kelson, happening to look behind him, saw a young woman of  prepossessing appearance ascending the steps of a dive in Clay Street.  He was instantly attracted, as he always was attracted by a pretty  woman, and something--a kind of intuition he had never had  before--told him that she was a waitress; that she was discontented  with her present situation; that she was engaged to be married to a  pen driver at Hastings & Hastings in Sacramento Street; and that she  had a mother, of over seventy, whom she kept. All this came to Kelson  like a flash of lightning.    Yielding to an impulse which he did not stay to analyse, he gripped  Hamar and Curtis, each too astonished even to remonstrate, by the arm,  and, dragging them along with him, followed the girl.    The dive had only just been opened, and was being dusted and swept by  two slatternly women with dago complexions, and voices like hyenas. It  still reeked of stale drink and tobacco.    \"What's the good of coming to a place like this?\" Hamar demanded, as  soon as he had freed himself from Kelson's clutches. \"We can't get  breakfast here.\"    \"Matt's mad, that's what's the matter with him,\" Curtis added in  disgust. \"Let's get out.\"    He turned to go--then, halted--and stood still. He appeared to be  listening. \"What's up with you?\" Hamar asked. \"Both you fellows are  behaving like lunatics this morning--there's not a pin to choose  between you.\"    \"They're playing cards, that's all,\" Curtis said. \"Can't you hear  them?\"    Hamar shook his head. \"Not a sound,\" he said. \"Just look at Matt!\"    While the other two were talking, Kelson had followed the girl to the  bar, and catching her up, just as she entered it, said in a manner  that was peculiar to him--a manner seldom without effect upon girls of  his class--\"I beg your pardon, miss, are we too early to be served?  Jerusalem! Haven't I met you somewhere before?\"    The girl looked him square in the eyes and then smiled. \"As like as  not,\" she said. \"I go pretty near everywhere! What do you want?\"    \"Well!\" Kelson soliloquized; \"breakfast is what we are particularly  anxious for--but I suppose that is out of the question in a dive!\"    \"Then why did you come here?\" the girl queried.    \"Because of you! Simply because of you,\" Kelson replied. \"You  hypnotized me!\"    \"That being so, then I reckon you can have your breakfast,\" the girl  laughed, \"though we don't provide them as a rule before nine. Indeed,  the management have only just decided--this morning--on providing them  at all.\"    \"How odd!\"    \"Why odd?\" the girl questioned, taking off her hat and arranging her  curls before a mirror.    \"Why, that I should have happened to strike the right moment! Had I  come here yesterday it would have been useless. As I said, you  hypnotized me. Evidently fate intended us to meet.\"    \"Do you believe in fate?\" the girl asked, shrugging her shoulders. \"I  believe in nothing--least of all in men!\"    \"You say so!\" Kelson observed, before he knew what he was saying. \"And  yet you have just got engaged to one. But you've got a bad attack of  the pip this morning, you have had enough of it here--you want to get  another post.\"    The girl ceased doing her hair and eyed him in amazement. \"Well!\" she  said. \"Of all the queer men I've ever met you are the queerest. Are  you a seer?\"    \"No!\" Hamar observed, suddenly joining in. \"He's only very hungry,  miss. Hungry body and soul! hungry all over. And so are we.\"    \"Well, then, go into the room over there,\" the girl cried, pointing in  the direction of a half-open door, \"and breakfast will be brought you  in half a jiffy.\"    \"Who's that playing cards?\" Curtis asked.    \"How do you know any one is playing cards?\" the girl queried with an  incredulous stare. \"You can't see through walls, can you?\"    \"No! and I'm hanged if I can explain,\" Curtis said, \"I seem to hear  them. There are two--one is called Arnold, and the other Lemon, or  some such name, and they are rehearsing certain card tricks they mean  to play to-night.\"    \"That's right,\" the girl said, \"two men named Arnold and Lemon are  here. They were playing all last night with two of the clerks in  Willows Bank, in Sacramento Street, and they cleared them out of every  cent. You knew it!\"    \"No! I didn't,\" Curtis growled, \"I don't lie for fun, and I'm just as  much in a fog, as to how I know, as you are. Let's have breakfast now,  and we'll look up these two gents afterwards, if they haven't gone.\"    \"Your friend's a brute, I don't like him,\" the girl whispered to  Kelson. \"Let him lose all he's got--you stay out here.\"    \"Nothing I should like better,\" Kelson said, \"it's a bargain!\"    The breakfast was so good that they lingered long over it, and the  bar-room had a fair sprinkling of people when they re-entered it.  Leaving Kelson to chat with the girl, Hamar and Curtis, obeying her  directions, found their way to a small parlour in the rear of the  building, where two men were lolling over a card table, smoking and  drinking, and reading aloud extracts from a pink sporting paper.    \"It's a funny thing,\" one of them exclaimed, \"we can't be allowed to  sit here in peace--when there's so much spare space in the house.\"    \"We beg your pardon for intruding,\" Curtis said, \"but my friend and I  came in here for a quiet game of cards. We're farmers down Missouri  way, and don't often get the chance to run up to town.\"    \"Farmers, are you!\" the man who had not yet spoken said, eyeing them  both closely. \"You don't look it. My friend Lemon, here, and I were  also wanting to have a game--would you care to join us?\"    \"By all means,\" Curtis at once exclaimed. \"What do you play?\"    \"Poker!\" the man said, \"Nap! Don! But I'll show you something first,  which, being fresh from the country, you've probably never seen  before, though they do tell me people in Missouri are mighty cute.\" He  then proceeded to show them what he called the Bull and Buffalo trick,  the secret of which he offered to sell them for ten dollars.    \"I wouldn't give you a cent for it!\" Curtis snapped. \"Any one can see  how it is done.\"    \"You can't!\" the man retorted, turning red. \"I'll wager twenty dollars  you can't.\" Curtis accepted the wager, and at once did the trick. He  had seen through it at a glance--there appeared no difficulty in it at  all; and yet he was quite certain if he had been asked to do it the  day before, he would have utterly failed.    \"Now,\" he said, \"give me the money,\"--and the man complied with an  oath.    \"Any more tricks?\" Curtis asked complacently.    \"I know heaps,\" the man rejoined. \"There's one you won't guess--the  seven card trick.\"    He did it. And so did Curtis.    \"Well I'm----\" the man called Lemon ejaculated.    \"He's the dandiest cove at tricks we've ever struck. Try him with the  Prince and Slipper, Arnold!\"    Arnold rather reluctantly assented, and Curtis burst out laughing.    \"Why!\" he said, \"that's the simplest of all! See!\" And it was done.  \"You two had better come to an understanding with us or you'll not  shine to-night. How about a game of Don?\"    Lemon and Arnold agreed, but they had barely begun before Curtis cried  out, \"It's no use, Lemon, I can see those deuces up your sleeve.  You've some up yours, too, Arnold--the deuce of clubs and the deuce of  hearts. Moreover, you can tell our cards by notches and thumb smears  on the backs. I'll show you how.\" He told the cards correctly--there  was no gainsaying it. The men were overwhelmed.    \"What are you, anyway?\" Lemon asked; \"tecs?\"    \"Never mind what we are!\" Curtis said"]]]
