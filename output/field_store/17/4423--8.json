The agent presently appeared pushing the truck of outgoing express,  a cheap trunk and a basket \"telescope\" belonging to one of the hotel  girls--who had quit her job and was sitting now inside waiting for  the train and seeing what she could of the Flying U boys through the  window--and the mail sack. He placed the truck where the baggage car  would come to a halt, stood for a minute looking down the track where a  smudge of smoke might at any moment be expected to show itself over the  low ridge of a hill, glanced at the lazy group in the patch of shade and  went back into the office.    \"There's her smoke,\" Cal Emmett announced in the midst of an apathetic  silence.    Weary looked up from whittling a notch in the end of a platform plank  and closed his jack-knife languidly.    Andy pushed his hat backward and then tilted it forward over one eyebrow  and threw away his cigarette.    \"Wonder if Florence Grace will be riding point on the bunch?\" he  speculated aloud. \"If she is, I'm liable to have my hands full. Florence  Grace will sure be sore when she finds out how I got into the game.\"    \"Aw, I betche there ain't no such a person,\" said Happy Jack, doubter to  the last.    \"I wish there wasn't,\" sighed Andy. \"Florence Grace is kinda getting  on my nerves. If I done what I feel like doing, I'd crawl under the  platform and size up the layout through a crack. Honest to gracious,  Boys, I hate to meet that lady.\"    They grinned at him heartlessly and stared at the black smudge that was  rolling toward them. \"She's sure hittin' her up,\" Pink vouchsafed with a  certain tenseness of tone. That train was not as ordinary trains; dimly  they felt that it was relentlessly bringing them trouble, perhaps;  certainly a problem--unless the homeseekers hovered only so long as  it took them to see that wisdom lay in looking elsewhere for a home.  Still--    \"If this was August instead of May, I wouldn't worry none about them  pilgrims staying long,\" Jack Bates voiced the thought that was uppermost  in their minds.    \"There comes two livery rigs to haul 'em to the hotel,\" Pink pointed out  as he glanced toward town. \"And there's another one. Johnny told me every  room they've got is spoke for, and two in every bed.\"    \"That wouldn't take no crowd,\" Happy Jack grumbled, remembering the  limitations of Dry Lake's hotel. \"Here come Chip and the missus. Wonder  what they want?\"    The Little Doctor left Chip to get their tickets and walked quickly  toward them.    \"Hello, boys! Waiting for someone, or just going somewhere?\"    \"Waiting. Same to you, Mrs. Chip,\" Weary replied.    \"To me? Well, we're going up to make our filings. Claude won't take a  homestead, because we'll have to stay on at the Flying U, of course, and  we couldn't hold one. But we'll both file desert claims. J. G. hasn't  been a bit well, and I didn't dare leave him before--and of course  Claude wouldn't go till I did. That the passenger coming, or a freight?\"    \"It's the train--with the dry-farmers,\" Andy informed her with a glance  at the nearing smoke-smudge.    \"Is it? We aren't any too soon then, are we? I left Son at home--and he  threatened to run away and live with you boys. I almost wish I'd brought  him along. He's been perfectly awful. So have the men Claude hired to  take your places, if you want to know, boys. I believe that is what  made J. G. sick--having those strange men on the place. He's been like a  bear.\"    \"Didn't Chip tell him--\"    \"He did, yes. He told him right away, that evening. But--J. G. has such  stubborn ideas. We couldn't make him believe that anyone would be crazy  enough to take up that land and try to make a living farming it. He--\"  She looked sidewise at Andy and pursed her lips to Keep from smiling.    \"He thinks I lied about it, I suppose,\" said that young man shrewdly.    \"That's what he says. He pretends that you boys meant to quit, and just  thought that up for an excuse. He'll be all right--you mustn't pay any  attention--\"    \"Here she comes!\"    A black nose thrust through a Deep cut that had a curve to it. At their  feet the rails began to hum. The Little Doctor turned hastily to see if  Chip were coming. The agent came out with a handful of papers and stood  waiting with the rest. Stragglers moved quickly, and the discharged  waitress appeared and made eyes covertly at Pink, whom she considered  the handsomest one of the lot.    The train slid up, slowed and stopped. Two coaches beyond the platform a  worried porter descended and placed the box-step for landing passengers,  and waited. From that particular coach began presently to emerge a  fluttering, exclaiming stream of humanity--at first mostly feminine.  They hovered there upon the cindery path and lifted their faces to watch  for others yet to come, and the babble of their voices could be, heard  above the engine sounds.    The Happy Family looked dumbly at one another and drew back closer to  the depot wall.    \"Aw, I knowed there was some ketch to it!\" blurted Happy Jack with  dismal satisfaction. \"That there ain't no colony--It's nothin' but a  bunch of schoolma'ams!\"    \"That lady ridin' point is the lady herself,\" Andy murmured, edging  behind Weary and Pink as the flutter came closer. \"That's Florence Grace  Hallman, boys.\"    \"Well, by golly, git out and speak your little piece, then!\" muttered  Slim, and gave Andy an unexpected push that sent him staggering out into  the open just as the leaders were coming up.    \"Why, how de do, Mr. Green!\" cried the blonde leader of the flock. \"This  is an unexpected pleasure, I'm sure.\"    \"Yes ma'am, it is,\" Andy assented mildly, with an eye cocked sidewise in  search of the guilty man.    The blonde leader paused, her flock coming to a fluttering, staring  stand behind her. The nostrils of the astonished Happy Family caught a  mingled odor of travel luncheons and perfume.    \"Well, where have you been, Mr. Green? Why didn't you come and see me?\"  demanded Florence, Grace Hallman in the tone of one who has a right  to ask leading questions. Her cool, brown, calculating eyes went  appraisingly over the Happy Family while she spoke.    \"I've been right around here, all the time,\" Andy gave meek account of  himself. \"I've been busy.\"    \"Oh. Did you go over the tract, Mr. Green?\" she lowered her voice.    \"Yes-s--I went over it.\"    \"And what do you think of it--privately?\"    \"Privately--it's pretty big.\" Andy sighed. The bigness of that tract had  worried the Happy Family a good deal.    \"Well, the bigger the better. You see I've got 'em started.\" She  flicked a glance backward at her waiting colony. \"You men are perfectly  exasperating! Why didn't you tell me where you were and what you were  doing?\" She looked up at him with charming disapproval. \"I feel like  shaking you! I could have made good use of you, Mr. Green.\"    \"I was making pretty good use of myself,\" Andy explained, and wished he  knew who gave him that surreptitious kick on the ankle. Did the chump  want an introduction? Well! In that case--    \"Miss Hallman, if you don't mind I'd like to introduce some men I  rounded up and brought here,\" he began before the Happy Family could  move out of the danger zone of his imagination. \"Representative  citizens, you see. You can sic your bunch onto 'em and get a lot of  information. This is Mr. Weary Davidson, Miss Hallman: He's a hayseed  that lives out that way and he talks spuds better than anything else.  And here's Slim--I don't know his right name--he raises hogs to a  fare-you-well. And this is Percy Perkins\"--meaning Pink--\"and he's  another successful dryfarmer. Goats is his trade. He's got a lot of 'em.  And Mr. Jack Bates, he raises peanuts--or he's trying 'em this year--and  has contracts to supply the local market. Mr. Happy Jack is our local  undertaker. He wants to sell out if he can, because nobody ever dies  in this country and that makes business slow. He's thinking some of  starting a duck-ranch. This man\"--indicating Big Medicine--\"has got  the finest looking crop of volunteer wild oats in the country. He knows  all about 'em. Mr. Emmett, here, can put you wise to cabbage-heads;  that's his specialty. And Mr. Miguel Rapponi is up here from Old Mexico  looking for a favorable location for an extensive rubber plantation. The  natural advantages here are simply great for rubber.    \"I've gone to some trouble gathering this bunch together for you, Miss  Hallman. I don't reckon you knew there was that many dry-farmers in the  country. They've all got ranches of their own, and the prettiest folders  you ever sent under a four-cent stamp can't come up to what these men  can tell you. Your bunch won't have to listen to one man, only--here's  half a dozen ready and waiting to talk.\"    Miss Hallman was impressed. A few of the closest homeseekers she  beckoned and introduced to the perspiring Happy Family--mostly feminine  homeseekers, of whom there were a dozen or so. The men whom the hotel  had sent down with rigs waited impatiently, and the unintroduced male  colonists stared at the low rim of Lonesome Prairie and wondered if over  there lay their future prosperity.    When the Happy Family finally made their escape, red-faced and muttering  threats, Andy Green had disappeared, and no one knew when he went or  where. He was not in Rusty Brown's place when the Happy Family went to  that haven and washed down their wrongs in beer. Pink made a hurried  trip to the livery stable and reported that Andy's horse was gone.    They were wondering among themselves whether he would have the nerve to  go home and await their coming--home at this stage of the game meaning  One Man coulee, which Andy had taken as a homestead and desert claim and  where the Happy Family camped together until such time as their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#12)"],[1," Perrynung and  Ahjereenya should be transposed.         _Class names_             _Feminine_    IX.
