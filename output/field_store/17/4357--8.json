We found here and elsewhere in the Cabinet, fine specimens of the  sulphate of Magnesia, (or Epsom salts,) a foot or two long, and three  inches in thickness.    Leaving the quiet and beautiful \"Cabinet,\" you come suddenly upon the  \"Rocky Mountains,\" furnishing a contrast so bold and striking, as  almost to startle you. Clambering up the rough side some thirty feet,  you pass close under the roof of the cavern you have left, and find  before you an immense transverse cave, 100 feet or more from the  ceiling to the floor, with a huge pile of rocks half filling the  hither side--they were probably dashed from the roof in the great  earthquake of 1811. Taking the left hand branch, you are soon brought  to \"Croghan's Hall,\" which is nine miles from the mouth, and is the  farthest point explored in that direction. The \"Hall\" is 50 or 60 feet  in diameter, and perhaps, thirty-five feet high, of a semi-circular  form. Fronting you as you enter, are massive stalactites, ten or  fifteen feet in length, attached to the rock, like sheets of ice, and  of a brilliant color. The rock projects near the floor, and then  recedes with a regular and graceful curve, or swell, leaving a cavity  of several feet in width between it and the floor. At intervals,  around this swell, stalactites of various forms are suspended, and  behind the sheet of stalactites first described, are numerous  stalagmites, in fanciful forms. I brought one away that resembles the  horns of the deer, being nearly translucent. In the centre of this  hall, a very large stalactite hangs from the roof; and a corresponding  stalagmite rises from the floor, about three feet in height and a foot  in diameter, of an amber color, perfectly smooth and translucent, like  the other formations. On the right, is a deep pit, down which the  water dashes from a cascade that pours from the roof. Other avenues  could most likely be found by sounding the sides of the pit, if any  one had the courage to attempt the descent. We are far enough from  _terra supra_, and our dinner which we had left at the \"Vineyard.\" We  hastened back to the Rocky Mountains, and took the branch which we  left at our right on emerging from the Cabinet. Pursuing the uneven  path for some distance, we reached \"Serena's Arbor,\" which was  discovered but three months since, by our guide \"Mat.\" The descent to  the Arbor seemed so perilous, from the position of the loose rocks  around, that several of the party would not venture. Those of us who  scrambled down regarded this as the crowning object of interest. The  \"Arbor\" is not more than twelve feet in diameter, and of about the  same height, of a circular form; but is, of itself, floor, sides,  roof, and ornaments, one perfect, seamless stalactite, of a beautiful  hue, and exquisite workmanship. Folds or blades of stalactitic matter  hang like drapery around the sides, reaching half way to the floor;  and opposite the door, a canopy of stone projects, elegantly  ornamented, as if it were the resting-place of a fairy bride. Every  thing seemed fresh and new; indeed, the invisible architect has not  quite finished this master-piece; for you can see the pure water,  trickling down its tiny channels and perfecting the delicate points of  some of the stalactites. Victoria, with all her splendor, has not in  Windsor Castle, so beautiful an apartment as \"Serena's Arbor.\"    Such is the description of Cleveland's Avenue, as given by this  clerical gentleman. It is perfectly graphic, and corresponds with all  the glowing accounts I have read of this famous place. Exquisitely  beautiful and rare as are the formations in this avenue, it will soon  be, I fear, like the Grotto of Pensico--shorn of its beauties. Many a  little Miss, to decorate her centre table or boudoir, and many a  thoughtless dandy to present a specimen to his lady fair, have broken  from the walls (regardless of the published rules prohibiting it,)  those lovely productions of the Almighty, which required ages to  perfect; thus destroying in a moment the work of centuries. These  beautiful and gorgeous formations were encrusted on the walls by the  hands of our Maker, and who so impious as to desecrate them--to tear  them from their place? there they are, all lovely and beautiful, and  there they ought to remain, _untouched_ by the hands of man, for the  admiration and wonder of all future ages. If the comparatively small  cave of Adelburg which belongs to the Emperor of Austria, be placed  for the preservation of its formations under the protecting care of  the government [Transcriber's note: sic] (as is the case,) what ought  not to be done to preserve the mineralogical treasures, in this great  Cave of America, and especially in Cleveland's Cabinet, which are  worth more than all the caves in Europe, indeed of the world, so far  as our knowledge of caverns extends.    Returning from Serena's Arbor, we passed on our left the mouth of an  avenue more than three miles long, lofty and wide, and at its  termination there is a hall, which in the opinion of the guide is  larger than any other in the Cave. It is as yet without a name.  Equidistant from the commencement and the termination of Cleveland's  Avenue, is a huge rock, nearly circular, flat on the top and three  feet high. This is the \"_dining table_.\" More than one hundred persons  could be seated around this table; on it the guide arranged our  dinner, and we luxuriated on \"flesh and fowl\" and \"choice old sherry.\"  Never did a set of fellows enjoy dinner more than we did ours. Our  friend B. was perfectly at his ease and happy; and, in the exuberance  of his spirits, proposed the following toast:        \"Prosperity to the subterranean territory of Cimmeria; large      enough, if not populous enough, for admission into the Union as      an independent State.\"    We emptied our glasses and gave nine hearty cheers in honor of the  sentiment. A proposition was made to adjourn, but B. was not inclined  to locomotion, and opposed it with great warmth, insisting that it was  too soon to move after such a dinner, and that a state of rest was  absolutely essential to healthy digestion. We had much argument on the  motion to adjourn; when our sagacious guide Stephen, with a meaning  look interposed, saying \"we had as well be going, for the river might  take a rise and shut us up here.\" \"What!\" exclaimed B. in utter  consternation, and with a start, literally bouncing from his seat,  cried aloud \"Let's be off!\" at the same time suiting the action to the  word. In a second we were all in motion, and hurrying past beautiful  incrustations, through galleries long and tortuous, down one hill and  up another, (poor B. puffing and blowing, and all the while exclaiming  against the _terrible_ length and ruggedness of the way,) we at last  reached the Echo, which we found to our great relief had _not risen_.  It seems, the guide had used this stratagem for our own advantage, to  break off our banquet, lest it trenched too far upon the night. We  were too happy in having our fears relieved, to fall out with him. On  our homeward bound passage over the rivers, our admiration was rather  increased than diminished. The death-like stillness! the awful  silence! the wild grandeur and sublimity of the scene, tranquilizing  the feeling and disposing to pensive musings and quiet contemplation;  on a sudden a pistol is fired--a tremendous report ensues--its echoes  are heard reverberating from wall to wall, in caves far away, like the  low murmuring sound of distant thunder--the spell of silence and deep  reverie is broken--we become roused and animated, and the mighty  cavern resounds with our song. We believe every one will, under  similar circumstances, experience this sudden transition from pensive  musings to joyous hilarity. Leaving the rivers, we hastened onward to  the outlet to the upper world. Far ahead we perceive the first  _dawnings of day_, shining with a silvery pallid hue on the walls, and  increasing in brightness as we advance, until it bursts forth in all  the golden rays and glorious effulgence of the setting sun. This  _parting_ scene is lovely and interesting. We bid adieu to the \"Great  Monarch of Caves.\" We here terminate our subterranean tour. Standing  on the grassy terrace above, we inhale the cool, pure air, and take a  last look at the \"great Wonder of Wonders!\" To all we would say \"go  and see--explore the greatest of the Almighty's subterranean works.\"  No description can give you an idea of it--neither can inspection of  other caves; it is \"the Monarch of Caves!\" none that have ever been  measured can at all compare with it, in extent, in grandeur, in wild,  solemn, serene, unadorned majesty; it stands entirely alone.--\"It has  no brother; it has no brother.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#12)"],[1," the capital of one of the circular figures; and  Mr. Lewis made a few slight drawings of one of the grotesque heads in the  exterior, of which the hair is of an uncommon fashion. The _Saxon whiskers_  are discoverable upon several of these faces. Upon the whole, it is  possible that parts of this church may have been built at the latter end of  the tenth century, after the Normans had made themselves completely masters  of this part of the kingdom; yet it is more probable that there is no  vestige left which claims a more ancient date than that of the end of the  eleventh century. I ought just to notice the church of _St. Sever_,[60]  supposed by some to be yet more ancient: but I had no opportunity of taking  a particular survey of it.    Thus much, or rather thus little, respecting the ECCLESIASTICAL ANTIQUITIES  of Rouen. They merit indeed a volume of themselves. This city could once  boast of upwards of _thirty parish churches_; of which very nearly a  _dozen_ have been recently (I mean during the Revolution) converted into  _warehouses_. It forms a curious, and yet melancholy melange--this strange  misappropriation of what was formerly held most sacred, to the common and  lowest purposes of civil life! You enter these warehouses, or offices of  business, and see the broken shaft, the battered capital, and  half-demolished altar-piece--the gilded or the painted frieze--in the midst  of bales of goods--casks, ropes, and bags of cotton: while, without, the  same spirit of demolition prevails in the fractured column, and tottering  arch way. Thus time brings its changes and decays--premature as well as  natural: and the noise of the car-men and injunctions of the clerk are now  heard, where formerly there reigned a general silence, interrupted only by  the matin or evening chaunt! I deplored this sort of sacrilegious  adaptation, to a respectable-looking old gentleman, sitting out of doors  upon a chair, and smoking his pipe--\"c'est dommage, Monsieur, qu'on a  converti l'eglise a\"--He stopped me: raised his left hand: then took away  his pipe with his right; gave a gentle whiff, and shrugging up his  shoulders, half archly and half drily exclaimed--\"Mais que voulez vous,  Monsieur?--ce sont des evenemens qu'on ne peut ni prevoir ni prevenir.  Voila ce que c'est!\" Leaving you to moralize upon this comfortable morceau  of philosophy, consider me ever, &c.      [36] A most ample and correct view of this west front will be found in Mr.      _Cotman's Norman Antiquities_.    [37] It is about 180 English feet in width, by about 150 in the highest      part of its elevation. The plates which I saw at Mr. Frere's,      bookseller, upon the Quai de Paris, from the drawings of Langlois,      were very inadequate representations of the building.    [38] The ravages committed by the Calvinists throughout nearly the whole of      the towns in Normandy, and especially in the cathedrals, towards the      year 1560, afford a melancholy proof of the effects of RELIGIOUS      ANIMOSITY. But the Calvinists were bitter and ferocious persecutors.      Pommeraye, in his quarto volume, _Histoire de l'Eglise Cathedrale de      Rouen_, 1686, has devoted nearly one hundred pages to an account of      Calvinistic depredations.    [39] [Mr. Cotman has a plate of the elevation of the front of this south      transept; and a very minute and brilliant one will be found in the      previous edition of this Tour--by Mr. Henry le Keux: for which that      distinguished Artist received the sum of 100 guineas. The remuneration      was well merited.]    [40] [Mons. Licquet says each clustered pillar contains thirty-one      columns.]    [41] This chapel is about ninety-five English feet in length, by thirty in      width, and sixty in heighth. The sprawling painting by Philippe de      Champagne, at the end of it, has no other merit than that of covering      so many square feet of wall. The architecture of this chapel is of the      XIVth century: the stained glass windows are of the latter end of the      XVth. On completing the circuit of the cathedral, one is surprised to      count not fewer than _twenty-five_ chapels.    [42] [Mons. Licquet is paraphrastically warm in his version, here. He      renders it thus: \"les atteintes effroyables du vandalisme      revolutionaire,\" vol. i. p. 64.]    [43] Sandford, after telling us that he thinks there \"never was any      portraiture\" of the Duke, thus sums up his character. \"He was justly      accounted one of the best generals that ever blossomed out of the      royal stem of PLANTAGENET. His valour was not more terrible to his      enemies than his memory honourable; for (doubtful whether with more      glory to him, or to the speaker) King Lewis the Eleventh being      counselled by certain envious persons to deface his tomb (wherein with      him, saith one, was buried all English men's good fortune in France)      used these indeed princely words: 'What honour shall it be to us, or      you, to break this monument, and to pull out of the ground the bones      of HIM, whom, in his life time, neither my father nor your      progenitors, with all their puissance, were once able to make flie a      foot backwarde? who, by his strength, policy and wit kept them all out      of the principal dominions of France, and out of this noble duchy of      Normandy? Wherefore, I say first, GOD SAVE HIS SOUL; and let his body      now lie in rest, which when he was alive, would have disquieted the      proudest of us all. And for THIS TOMB, I assure you it is not so      worthy or convenient as his honour and acts have deserved.'\" p. 314-5,      Ed. 1707[A] The famous MISSAL, once in the possession of this      celebrated nobleman, and containing the only authenticated portrait of      him (which is engraved in the _Bibliog. Decameron_, vol. i. p.      cxxxvii.) is now the property of John Milner, Esq. of York Place,      Portman Square, who purchased it of the Duke of Marlborough. The Duke      had purchased it at the sale of the library of the late James Edwards,      Esq. for 687l. 15s.            [A] [Upon this, Mons. Licquet, with supposed shrewdness and          success, remarks,--\"All very well: but we must not forget that the          innocent Joan of Arc was burnt alive--thanks to this said Duke of          Bedford, as every one knows!\"]    [44] [A different tale may be told of ONE of his Successors in the same      Anglo-Norman pursuit. The expenses attending the graphic      embellishments alone of the previous edition of this work, somewhat      exceeded the sum of _four thousand seven hundred pounds._ The risk was      entirely my own. The result was the loss of about 200l.: exclusively      of the expences incurred in travelling about 2000 miles. The      _copper-plates_ (notwithstanding every temptation, and many      entreaties, to _multiply_ impressions of several of the subjects      engraved) were DESTROYED. There may be something more than a mere      negative consolation, in finding that the work is RISING in price,      although its author has long ceased to partake of any benefit      resulting from it.]    [45] A plate of this Monument is published in the Tour of Normandy by      Dawson Turner, Esq.    [46] The Cardinal died in his fiftieth year only; and his funeral was      graced and honoured by the presence of his royal master. Guicciardini      calls him \"the oracle and right arm of Louis.\" Of eight brothers, whom      he left behind, four attained to the episcopal rank. His nephew      succeeded him as Archbishop. See also _Historia Genealogica Magnatum      Franciae_; vol. vii. p. 129; quoted in the _Gallia Christiana_, vol.      xi. col. 96.        It was during the archiepiscopacy of the successor of the nephew of      Amboise--namely, that of CHARLES of BOURBON--that the _Calvanistic      persecution_ commenced. \"Tunc vero coepit civitas, dioecesis,      universaque provincia lamentabilem in modum conflictari, saevientibus      ob religionis dissidia plusquam civilibus bellis,\" &c. But then the      good Archbishop, however bountiful he might have been towards the poor      at _Roncesvalles_, (when he escorted Philip II.'s first wife      Elizabeth, daughter of Henry II. to the confines of Spain, after he      had married her to that wretched monarch) should not have inflamed the      irritated minds of the Calvinists, by BURNING ALIVE, in 1559, _John      Cottin_, one of their most eminent preachers, by way of striking      terror into the rest! Well might the Chronicler observe, as the      result, \"novas secta illa in dies acquirebat vires.\" About 1560-2, the      Calvinists got the upper hand; and repaid the Catholics with a      vengeance. Charles of Bourbon died in 1590: so that he had an arduous      and agitated time of it.    [47] How long will this monument--(matchless of its kind)--continue      unrepresented by the BURIN? If Mr. Henry Le Keux were to execute it in      his best style, the world might witness in it a piece of Art entirely      perfect of its kind. But let the pencils of Messrs. Corbould and Blore      be first exercised on the subject. In the mean while, why is GALLIC      ART inert?    [48] The choir was formerly separated from the surrounding chapels, or      rather from the space between it and the chapels, by a superb brass      grating, full of the most beautiful arabesque ornaments--another      testimony of the magnificent spirit of the Cardinal and Prime Minister      of Louis XII.: whose arms, as well as the figure of his patron, St.      George, were seen in the centre of every compartment ... The      Revolution has not left a vestige behind!
