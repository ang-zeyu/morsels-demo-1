It was necessary to go into these details in order that we might  understand as much as possible of the process by which the gods of the  Sibylline books were assimilated into the body of Roman religion. We see  how in the main they were superfluous and therefore unnecessary and even  undesirable because by their presence they robbed old Roman deities of  their existence, and how those elements in them which were least in  accord with the old Roman spirit were most apt to develop, and how in  general their adoption was a purely mechanical process, like any act in  witchcraft, where the form is all important because the meaning cannot  be understood, and how totally different therefore the estate of these  gods was in Rome from what it had been in Greece, because in Rome they  were introduced, stripped of all their mythology, worshipped only for  their practical bearings, and compelled therefore to work for their  living.    The importation of grain from Cumae meant more to Rome than the mere  satisfaction of her physical needs; it meant much more than the addition  of three deities to her state-cult, for the grain thus imported was  carried from Cumae to Ostia by sea and so up the Tiber to Rome, and the  whole matter therefore marks one of the important steps in Rome's  interest in commerce generally but especially in ocean commerce. As yet  she did not do the actual carrying herself, but she began to be  interested in it, and the sea began to mean something to this inland  town. This increased interest in trade in general and this inceptive  interest in those who \"go down to the sea in ships\" have both of them  left their reflexion in the religious life of the time; two new deities  are introduced, both of them almost certainly by means of the Sibylline  oracles, though some accidental blanks in our historical tradition have  deprived us of details.    The chronicle of the year B.C. 495 tells us that there was a dispute in  that year as to who should dedicate the temple of Mercury. This is  Mercury's first appearance in our sources. The circumstances of the  vowing of the temple have been omitted through some oversight, but in  spite of this the connexion of his introduction with the Sibylline books  is beyond all reasonable doubt, for the simple reason that the guardians  of the oracles always looked after his cult in all subsequent time.  Notwithstanding the suddenness of his appearance and the silence of the  chronicle, his story is quite clear and his past history easy to  restore, at least in outline.    The versatile Hermes, who as messenger of the gods plays a part in so  many Greek myths, became in the course of time among other things  associated with travelling, as god of roads, and also with trade,  partly because trading necessitates travelling, and partly because  Hermes was also the protector of the market-place in which the trading  was done. Thus he was called \"Hermes Protector of the Merchant\"  (_Empolaios_) and in this capacity went into the colonies of Greece,  including those of Southern Italy. Thus Hermes travelled with the grain  merchant from Cumae and became known to the Romans. They however knew  him merely as the god of trade, and their name for him is nothing but  the translation into Latin of his Greek cult-title: _Empolaios_ =  _Mercurius_. For a long time it was thought that there had existed a  Mercurius among the original gods of Rome, but the traces of this old  god are apparent rather than real and suggest one phase of that pastime  of which the later Romans were so fond, that of writing history  backwards and putting an artificial halo of antiquity about the gods  whom they borrowed from Greece. Thus Mercury was received into the  state-cult at about the time when the grain trade began, and was, as it  were, the divine representative of the interest which the Roman state  took in the whole transaction. His temple was outside the _pomerium_ on  the Aventine side of the Circus Maximus. It was in this temple of the  merchant god that the primitive Chamber of Commerce (_collegium  mercatorum_) had its beginning, an association, partly sacral, partly  commercial, whose members, the _mercuriales_, are frequently met with  in literature and also in inscriptions, one of which has been found as  far away as the island of Delos. In the actual cult of the Romans  Mercury never regained the many-sidedness which he had lost in coming to  them merely as a god of trade. In this capacity he appears on the  sextans of the old copper coinage, and under the empire he went into the  provinces as the companion of Mars, since the merchant went side by side  with the soldier. On the contrary when in the third century before  Christ Greek literature came to Rome, this simple idea of Mercury was  reinforced by many new Greek ideas and he entered into Roman poetry with  all the attributes and functions of Hermes; but this had little or no  effect on the cult and there were no great rivals to the old temple near  the Circus Maximus, no cult-centre with advanced Greek ideas, as we have  seen spring up in the case of Hercules, Castor, Minerva, and Diana.    We have already seen how the rise of the grain trade brought four new  deities to Rome, but there is one more chapter to our story. The grain  itself and the trade itself had now obtained their divine complements,  but the sea had not yet received its due; it too must have its parallel  among the gods of Rome. And so it came to pass that again under the  influence of the fateful books, though exactly when or how we cannot  say, the Greek Poseidon came into Rome. The sea had always meant much  to the Greeks, and the joyful shout of Xenophon's troops \"The sea! the  sea!\" finds an echo all through the centuries of Greek history before  and after the Anabasis. But the multitude of islands and harbours in  Greece is in marked contrast to the dearth of them in Italy, where even  to-day there is no good port of call on the west coast between Naples  and Civitavecchia--and the latter would be useless, were it not for  Trajan's mole. In Italy accordingly the sea-god Poseidon was worshipped  only in the Greek colonies, where however he had two famous cults, one  at Tarentum, later called Colonia Neptunia, and one at Paestum, whose  old name was Poseidonia. The Romans had worshipped deities of water in  abundance, as became an agricultural people, for water meant life, and  drought, death; but their deities were those of the sweet waters of  springs and rivers, they knew no god of the sea. But when the oracles  brought Poseidon to Rome he was identified with an old Roman water-god  Neptune, whose cult henceforward included the sea. We do not know where  the shrine of the old sweet-water Neptune had been, but his old festival  had occurred on July 23. The new Poseidon-Neptune was given a temple  outside the _pomerium_ in the Campus Martius, but the new was connected  with the old in so far at least that the dedication day of the new  temple was July 23, the day of the old Neptune festival.    With the introduction of Neptune, the sea-god, the state had  accomplished, as it were, a sort of divine marine insurance; the  transport of the grain was now watched over by a Roman god; but it was  not to be expected that the cult of a sea-god would ever mean very much  to the Romans. The maritime commerce of the Eternal City was very slow  in developing, and it grew to its subsequent proportions, not because  the Romans of Italy engaged in it, but because those foreigners who took  to the sea by nature later became Romans. Nor did naval warfare fall to  her lot until the First Punic War, and even then her victories were  gained by the tactics of land fighting transferred to the decks of two  ships, her own and the enemy's, fastened together by landing-bridges,  and the glory of victory was due not to Neptune but to Mars. It was not  until the civil wars at the close of the republic that real naval  battles occurred, and that Neptune received his share of glory for the  victory at Actium in B.C. 31, and later over Sextus Pompeius, in a  temple erected by Agrippa in the Campus Martius, behind the beautiful  columns of which the Roman Stock-Exchange transacts its business to-day.    In the first decade of the republic therefore, as we have seen, a group  of Greek gods was introduced by the Sibylline oracles, no one of whom  can be said to have been really needed, no one of whom except the  sea-element in Neptune represented any new and vital principles not  already present in the religious world, if not of Numa, at least of  Servius. The best that can be said of these gods is that one or two of  them, notably Mercury and Neptune, exerted no positively detrimental  influences on later generations. For the next two centuries our  chronicles are silent, so far as the actual introduction of new deities  by the aid of the books is concerned, and it is not until B.C. 293 that  the narrative of new gods begins again. But in other ways the oracles  were not idle during these two hundred years. We must rid ourselves of  the idea that it was necessary that their consultation should always  result in the importation of some new Greek deity. The oracles might  order the carrying out of some new religious rite regarding the deities  already present, and these religious rites, especially the public  processions so frequently performed, feed the ever-growing superstition  of the populace. It is essential to a charm or incantation that it  should contain something strange or foreign, it is above all things"]]]
