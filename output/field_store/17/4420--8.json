Hoelderlin eagerly sought after happiness and contentment, but fortune  eluded him at every turn. Lenau on the contrary thrust it from him with  true ascetic spirit.    The mere thought of submitting to the ordinary process of negotiations  and recommendations for a vacant professorship of Esthetics in Vienna is  so repulsive to his pride, that the whole matter is at once allowed to  drop, notwithstanding that he has been preparing for the place by  diligent philosophical studies.[137] The asceticism with which he  regarded life in general is expressed in a letter to Emilie Reinbeck,  1843, in which he says: \"Wer die Welt gestalten helfen will, muss darauf  verzichten, sie zu geniessen.\"[138] But more often this resignation  becomes a defiant challenge: \"Ich habe dem Leben gegenueber nun einmal  meine Stellung genommen, es soll mich nicht hinunterkriegen. Dass mein  Widerstand nicht der eines ruhigen Weisen ist, sondern viel Trotziges an  sich hat, das liegt in meinen Temperament.\"[139]    Another characteristic difference between Lenau's Weltschmerz and  Hoelderlin's lies in the fact that the writings of the latter do not  exhibit that absolute and abject despair which marks Lenau's lyrics.  Typical for both poets are the lines addressed by each to a rose:        Ewig traegt im Mutterschosse,      Suesse Koenigin der Flur,      Dich und mich die stille, grosse,      Allbelebende Natur.        Roeschen unser Schmuck veraltet,      Sturm entblaettert dich und mich,      Doch der ew'ge Keim entfaltet      Bald zu neuer Bluete sich![140]    Unmistakable as is the melancholy strain of these verses, they are not  without a hopeful afterthought, in which the poet turns from  self-contemplation to a view of a larger destiny. Not so in Lenau's  poem, \"Welke Rosen\":        In einem Buche blaetternd, fand      Ich eine Rose welk, zerdrueckt,      Und weiss auch nicht mehr, wessen Hand      Sie einst fuer mich gepflueckt.        Ach mehr und mehr im Abendhauch      Verweht Erinn'rung; bald zerstiebt      Mein Erdenlos; dann weiss ich auch      Nicht mehr, wer mich geliebt.[141]    The intensely personal note of the last stanza is in marked contrast  with the corresponding stanza of Hoelderlin's poem just quoted. Further  evidence that Lenau's Weltschmerz was constitutional, while Hoelderlin's  was the result of experience, lies in this very fact, that nowhere do  the writings of the former exhibit that stage of buoyant expectation,  youthful enthusiasm, or hopeful striving, which we find in some of the  earlier poems of the latter. In Hoelderlin's ode \"An die Hoffnung,\" he  apostrophizes hope as \"Holde! guetig Geschaeftige!\"        Die du das Haus der Trauernden nicht verschmaehst.[142]    Lenau, in his poem of the same title, tells us he has done with hope:        All dein Wort ist Windesfaecheln;      Hoffnung! dann nur trau' ich dir,      Weisest du mit Trosteslaecheln      Mir des Todes Nachtrevier.[143]    Even his Faust gives himself over almost from the outset to abject  despair.    Logically consequent upon this state of mind is the poet's oft-repeated  longing for death. The persistency of this thought may be best  illustrated by a few quotations from poems and letters, arranged  chronologically:    1831. Mir wird oft so schwer, als ob ich einen Todten in mir  herumtruege.[144]    1833.      Und mir verging die Jugend traurig,             Des Fruehlings Wonne blieb versaeumt,             Der Herbst durchweht mich trennungsschaurig,             Mein Herz dem Tod entgegentraeumt.[145]    1837. Heute dachte ich oefter an den Tod, nicht mit bitterem Trotz        und stoerrischem Verlangen, sondern mit freundlichem Appetit.[146]    1837. Soll ich Dir alles sagen? Wisse, dass ich wirklich daran        dachte, mir den Tod zu geben.[147]    1838. Der Gedanke des Todes wird mir immer freundlicher, und ich        verschwende mein Leben gerne.[148]    1838.      Durchs Fenster kommt ein duerres Blatt             Vom Wind hereingetrieben;             Dies leichte offne Brieflein hat             Der Tod an mich geschrieben.[149]    1840. Oft will mich's gemahnen, als haette ich auf Erden nichts        mehr zu thun, und ich wuenschte dann, Gervinus moechte        recht haben, indem er, wie Georg mir erzaehlte, mir einen        baldigen Zusammenbruch und Tod prophezeite.[150]    1842. Ich habe ein wolluestiges Heimweh, in Deinen Armen zu        sterben.[151]    1843. Selig sind die Betaeubten! noch seliger sind die Toten![152]    1844.      In dieses Waldes leisem Rauschen             Ist mir, als hoer' ich Kunde wehen,             Dass alles Sterben und Vergehen             Nur heimlichstill vergnuegtes Tauschen.[153]    If we should seek for the Leit-motif of Lenau's Weltschmerz, we should  unquestionably have to designate it as the _transientness of life_. Thus  in the poem \"Die Zweifler,\" he exclaims:        Vergaenglichkeit! wie rauschen deine Wellen      Durch's weite Labyrinth des Lebens fort![154]    Ten per cent, of all Lenau's lyrics bear titles which directly express  or suggest this thought, as for example, \"Vergangenheit,\"  \"Vergaenglichkeit,\" \"Das tote Glueck,\" \"Einst und Jetzt,\" \"Aus!,\" \"Eitel  Nichts,\" \"Verlorenes Glueck,\" \"Welke Rose,\" \"Vanitas,\" \"Scheiden,\"  \"Scheideblick,\" and the like; while in not less than seventy-one per  cent of his lyrics there are allusions, more or less direct, to this  same idea, which shows beyond a doubt how large a component it must have  been of the poet's characteristic mood.    If Hoelderlin, the idealist, judges the things which are, according to  his standard of things as they _ought to be_, Lenau, on the other hand,  measures them by the things which _have been_.        Friedhof der entschlafnen Tage,      Schweigende Vergangenheit!      Du begraebst des Herzens Klage,      Ach, und seine Seligkeit![155]    Nowhere is this mental attitude of the poet toward life in all its forms  more clearly defined than in his views of nature. That this is an  entirely different one from Hoelderlin's goes without saying. Lenau has  nothing of that naive and unsophisticated childlike nature-sense which  Hoelderlin possessed, and which enabled him to find comfort and  consolation in nature as in a mother's embrace. So that while for  Hoelderlin intercourse with nature afforded the greatest relief from his  sorrows, Lenau's Weltschmerz was on the contrary intensified thereby.  For him the rose has no fragrance, the sunlight no warmth, springtime no  charms, in a word, nature has neither tone nor temper, until such has  been assigned to it by the poet himself. And as he is fully aware of the  artistic possibilities of the mantle of melancholy \"um die wunde Brust  geschlungen,\"[156] it follows consistently that he should select for  poetic treatment only those aspects of nature which might serve to  intensify the expression of his grief.    Among the titles of Lenau's lyrics descriptive of nature are \"Herbst,\"  \"Herbstgefuehl\" (twice), \"Herbstlied,\" \"Ein Herbstabend,\"  \"Herbstentschluss,\" \"Herbstklage,\" and many others of a similar kind,  such as \"Das duerre Blatt,\" \"In der Wueste,\" \"Fruehlings Tod,\" etc. If we  disregard a few quite exceptional verses on spring, the statement will  hold that Lenau sees in nature only the seasons and phenomena of  dissolution and decay. So in \"Herbstlied\":        Ja, ja, ihr lauten Raben,      Hoch in der kuehlen Luft,      's geht wieder ans Begraben,      Ihr flattert um die Gruft![157]    \"Je mehr man sich an die Natur anschliesst,\" the poet writes to Sophie  Schwab, \"je mehr man sich in Betrachtungen ihrer Zuege vertieft, desto  mehr wird man ergriffen von dem Geiste der Sehnsucht, des schwermuetigen  Hinsterbens, der durch die Natur auf Erden weht.\"[158] Characteristic is  the setting which the poet gives to the \"Waldkapelle\":        Der dunkle Wald umrauscht den Wiesengrund,      Gar duester liegt der graue Berg dahinter,      Das duerre Laub, der Windhauch gibt es kund,      Geschritten kommt allmaehlig schon der Winter.        Die Sonne ging, umhuellt von Wolken dicht,      Unfreundlich, ohne Scheideblick von hinnen,      Und die Natur verstummt, im Daemmerlicht      Schwermuetig ihrem Tode nachzusinnen.[159]    The sunset is represented as a dying of the sun, the leaves fall sobbing  from the trees, the clouds are dissolved in tears, the wind is described  as a murderer. We see then that Lenau's treatment of nature is  essentially different from Hoelderlin's. The latter explains man through  nature; Lenau explains nature through man. Hoelderlin describes love as a  heavenly plant,[160] youth as the springtime of the heart,[161] tears as  the dew of love;[162] Lenau, on the other hand, characterizes rain as  the tears of heaven, for him the woods are glad,[163] the brooklet  weeps,[164] the air is idle, the buds and blossoms listen,[165] the  forest in its autumn foliage is \"herbstlich geroetet, so wie ein  Kranker, der sich neigt zum Sterben, wenn fluechtig noch sich seine  Wangen faerben.\"[166] A remarkable simile, and at the same time  characteristic for Lenau in its morbidness is the following:        Wie auf dem Lager sich der Seelenkranke,      Wirft sich der Strauch im Winde hin und her.[167]    Hoelderlin speaks of a friend's bereavement as \"ein schwarzer  Sturm\";[168] when he had grieved Diotima he compares himself to the  cloud passing over the serene face of the moon;[169] gloomy thoughts he  designates by the common metaphor \"der Schatten eines Woelkchens auf der  Stirne.\"[170] Lenau turns the comparison and says:        Am Himmelsantlitz wandelt ein Gedanke,      Die duestre Wolke dort, so bang, so schwer.[171]    Where Hoelderlin finds delight in the incorporeal elements of nature,  such as light, ether, and ascribes personal qualities and functions to  them, Lenau on the contrary always chooses the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17373"],[0,"The Madonna in Art (#12)"],[1,"of the Pomegranate is another work by Botticelli which  belongs in this class of pictures. It is a _tondo_ in the Uffizi,  showing the figures in half length. The Virgin, encircled by angels,  holds the child half reclining on her lap. Her face is inexpressibly  sad, and the child shares her mood, as he raises his little hand to  bless the spectator. Two angels bear the Virgin's flowers, roses and  lilies; two others hold books. They bend towards the queen as the  petals of a rose bend towards the centre, with the serious grace  peculiar to Botticelli.    [Illustration: BOTTICELLI.--MADONNA OF THE  POMEGRANATE .]    In connection with the peculiar type of melancholy exhibited on the  face of Botticelli's Madonna, it will be of interest to refer to the  work of Francia. The two artists were, in some points, kindred  spirits; both felt the burden of life's mystery and sorrow. Francia,  as we have seen, imbibed from the works of Perugino something of the  spirit of mysticism common to the Umbrian school. But while there is a  certain resemblance between his Madonna and Perugino's, the former has  less of sentimentality than the latter, and more real melancholy. Like  Botticelli's Virgin, she acts her part half-heartedly, as if the sword  had already begun to pierce her heart. Francia's favorite Madonna  subjects were of the higher order, the Madre Pia and the Madonna as  Witness. In treating the latter, his Christ-child is always in keeping  with the mother, a grave little fellow who gives the blessing with  almost touching dignity. Enthroned Madonnas illustrating the theme are  those of the Hermitage at St. Petersburg, of the Belvedere at Vienna,  and the famous Bentivoglio Madonna in S. Jacopo Maggiore at Bologna.  The last-named is one of the works which enable us to understand  Raphael's high praise of the Bolognese master. It is a noble  composition, full of strong religious feeling.    [Illustration: MURILLO.--MADONNA AND CHILD.]    It is a long leap from the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries,  taking us from a period of genuine religious fervor in art, into an  age of artificial imitation. In the midst of the decadence of old  ideals and the birth of art methods entirely new, arose one who seemed  to be the reincarnation of the old spirit in a form peculiar to his  age and race. This was Murillo, the peasant-painter of Spain, than  whom was never artist more pious, not even excepting the angelic  brother of San Marco. He alone in the seventeenth century kept  alive the pure flame of religious fervor, which had burned within the  devout Italians of the early school. Through all his pictures of the  Virgin and child we can see that the Madonna as the Christ-bearer is  the ideal he always has in view. He falls short of it, not through any  lack of earnestness, but because his type of womanhood is incapable of  expressing such lofty idealism. His virgins are modelled upon the  simple Andalusian maidens, sweet, timid, dark-eyed creatures. Their  faces glow with gentle affection as they look wistfully out of the  picture, or raise their eyes to heaven, as if dimly discerning the  heights which they have never reached.    The Pitti Madonna is one of this sweet company, and perhaps the  loveliest of them all. Both she and her beautiful boy are full of  gentle earnestness, and if they are too simple-minded to realize what  is in store for them, they are none the less ready to do the Father's  will.    One more picture remains for us to consider as an illustration of the  Madonna as Witness. Had we mentioned it first, nothing further could  have been said on the subject. The Sistine Madonna is the greatest  ever produced, from every point of view. We have already noted the  superiority of its artistic composition over all other enskied  Madonnas, and are the more ready to appreciate its higher merits; for  its strongest hold upon our admiration is in its moral and religious  significance. Its theme is the transfiguration of loving and  consecrated motherhood. Mother and child, united in love, move towards  the glorious consummation of the heavenly kingdom.    [Illustration: RAPHAEL.--SISTINE MADONNA.]    It has been said that Raphael made no preparatory studies for this  Madonna, but, in a larger sense, he spent his life in preparation  for it. He had begun by imitating the mystic sweetness of Perugino's  types, drawn by an intuitive delicacy of perception to this spiritual  idealism, while yet too inexperienced to express any originality.  Then, by an inevitable reaction, he threw himself into the creation of  a purely naturalistic Madonna, and carried the Mater Amabilis to its  utmost perfection. Having mastered all the secrets of woman's beauty,  he returned once more to the higher realm of idealism to send forth  his matured conception of the Madonna as the Christ-bearer.    The Sistine Madonna is above all words of praise; all extravagance of  expression is silenced before her simplicity. Hers is the beauty of  symmetrically developed womanhood; the perfect poise of her figure is  not more marked than the perfect poise of her character. Not one  false note, not one exaggerated emphasis, jars upon the harmony of  body, soul, and spirit. Confident, but entirely unassuming; serious,  but without sadness; joyous, but not to mirthfulness; eager, but  without haste; she moves steadily forward with steps timed to the  rhythmic music of the spheres. The child is no burden, but a part of  her very being. The two are one in love, thought, and purpose. Sharing  the secret of his sacred calling, the mother bears her son forth to  meet his glorious destiny.    Art can pay no higher tribute to Mary, the Mother of Jesus, than to  show her in this phase of her motherhood. We sympathize with her  maternal tenderness, lavishing fond caresses upon her child. We go  still deeper into her experience when we see her bowed in sweet  humility before the cares and duties she is called upon to assume.  But we are admitted to the most cherished aspirations of her soul,  when we see her oblivious of self, carrying her child forth to the  service of humanity. It is thus that she becomes one of his \"witnesses  unto the people;\" it is thus that \"all generations shall call her  blessed.\"          BIBLIOGRAPHY.      MRS.
