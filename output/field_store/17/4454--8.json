When a man desires to clear or plant a field or to build a  house, he summons his friends to aid him and they respond with no idea  of payment other than their food and drink, and the return of like  services when they are in similar need.    BIRTH.    For about six months before and after the birth of a child the mother is  relieved from hard labor; she is not allowed to taste of any thing sour,  neither may she eat dried fish or flesh, lest her child be thin and  weak. The father is under no restrictions other than that he is expected  to remain near to his home for a few days following the birth of a  child. Other action on his part would be considered by the spirits as an  admission that he does not care for the child, and they would cause the  umbilical cord to decay so that the child would die. The mother is  delivered in the regular dwelling, where she is attended by two or more  midwives or _mabalian_.[34] She is placed with her back against an  inclined board, while in her hands she holds a rope which is attached to  the roof. With the initial pains, one of the midwives massages the  abdomen, while another prepares a drink made from leaves, roots, and  bark, and gives it to the expectant woman. The preparation of this  concoction was taught by friendly spirits, and it is supposed to insure  an easy delivery. Still another _mabalian_ spreads a mat in the middle  of the room, and on it places valuable cloths, weapons, and gongs, which  she offers to the spirits; praying that they will make the birth easy  and give good health to the infant. The articles offered at this time  can be used by their former owners but as they are now the property of  the spirits they must not be sold or traded. The writer was very anxious  to secure an excellent weapon which had been thus offered. The user  finally agreed to part with it but first he placed it beside another of  equal value, and taking a piece of betel nut he rubbed each weapon with  it a number of times, then dipping his fingers in the water he touched  both the old and the new blades, all the time asking the spirit to  accept and enter the new weapon. The child is removed by the _mabalian_  who, in cutting the umbilical cord, makes use of the kind of knife used  by the members of the child's sex, otherwise the wound would never heal.  The child is placed on a piece of soft betel bark, \"for its bones are  soft and our hands are hard and are apt to break the soft bones,\" then  water is poured over it and its body is rubbed with _pogonok_.[35] The  afterbirth is placed in a bamboo tube, is covered with ashes and a leaf,  and the whole is hung against the side of the dwelling where it remains  until it falls of its own accord or the house is destroyed. In Cibolan  the midwife applies a mixture of clay and herbs called _karamir_ to the  eyes of all who have witnessed the birth \"so that they will not become  blind.\" Having done this she gives the child its name, usually that of a  relative, and her duties are over. As payment she will receive a large  and a small knife, a plate, some cloth, and a needle.[36]    [34] In Cibolan the midwife is called _taratEk-Ekn_, and need not be a  _mabalian_.    [35] A medicine made of bark and rattan.    [36] The payment given at the birth of a boy is somewhat greater than  that for a girl.    In Malilla the naming does not take place until three clays after the  birth, and the eyes are not always anointed, although the old people  agree that it is an ancient custom and \"a good thing to do.\" At that  time the mat containing the gifts is spread on the floor and the  offerings are again called to the attention of the spirits, who are  urged to look to the welfare of the child. Should the infant be ailing,  or cry a great deal, it is a sign that the spirits are displeased with  the name given to it and another will be substituted; however, this does  not seem to be done with an idea of fooling the spirits, as is the case  with some other tribes. The child is nursed until two or three years of  age, or until another takes its place. There is no superstition  concerning twins, but triplets are at once put to death by filling their  mouths with ashes, otherwise \"the parents would die, for they are like  dogs.\"    When questioned concerning abortion, Datu Tongkaling asserted that he  considered it \"very bad,\" and that he would prohibit any _mabalian_ who  assisted in such a practice from continuing her profession, but he said  that despite his orders secret medicines which produce that result are  sometimes administered. Such a practice is not common, however, as  children are greatly desired and no worse slur can be applied to a woman  than to speak of her as barren.    So far as could be learned there is no ceremony or celebration of any  kind when a child reaches the age of puberty but soon thereafter its  teeth will be filed and blackened. In some villages the boys are  circumcised, but the practice is not compulsory, neither is it general  throughout the territory.    MARRIAGE.    Marriage among the Bagobo takes place much later than is common among  most Philippine tribes, the couple often being eighteen or twenty years  of age. As a rule the parents of the boy select the girl and negotiate  the match. Going to the house of the girl they casually broach the  subject and if her parents are favorable, a day is set to discuss the  details. This meeting is attended by the friends and relatives of both  families, and two head-men or _datu_ must also be present to represent  the contracting parties. The price the girl should bring varies  according to the wealth of the interested parties and the  accomplishments of the bride. Whatever the sum paid, the father of the  girl must make a return present equal to one-half the value of the  marriage gift \"so that he does not sell his daughter like a slave.\"  Usually marriage does not take place until a year or more after this  settlement, and during the interval the boy must serve his father-in-law  to be. When the time for the final ceremony arrives the relatives and  friends assemble and for two or three days they feast and make merry. A  _mabalian_ spreads a mat on the floor, places on it many valuable  articles and then offers all to the spirits, in order that they may be  pleased to give the couple a long and prosperous life together. Finally,  she puts a dish of rice on the mat and, after offering it to the  spirits, places it between the boy and the girl as they sit on the  floor. The girl takes a handful of the rice and feeds it to the boy who,  in turn, feeds her, and the ceremony is complete. The couple may then go  to their new home, but for several years the girl's family will exact a  certain amount of service from the groom.    A slight variation of the usual order occurred recently at the marriage  of one of Datu Tongkaling's sons. At that time all the details were  arranged by the _datu_, who, accompanied by his son and a number of  relatives, went to the girl's house and proposed the union. After the  girl had brought wine, betel nut, and food, and had placed them before  the visitors, she was directed by her mother to make a carrying bag for  her lover. Had she objected to the union and refused to make this gift,  her decision would probably have been accepted as final and all  negotiations abandoned. However, it is not customary for the young  people to refuse to carry out the wishes of their elders. As the girl  offered no objections, the party fell to discussing the price the groom  should pay, and finally, after several hours of bargaining, decided that  he should furnish her father with one _agong_,[37] one horse, and a  double betel box.[38] Five days later, when he paid this sum, he  received a return gift of one _agong_ and ten skirts from the bride's  mother. About one-half the value of the groom's gift was distributed  among the girl's relatives, who were at the same time admonished that,  in case a separation should occur, they would be expected to return an  equal amount. In the presence of about a hundred friends, the pair drank  wine from the same dish, then submitted to having a little hair cut from  their heads, and were pronounced man and wife. Before they retired for  the night the _mabalian_ combed their hair, then, having directed the  groom to precede his bride to their sleeping place, she secured a child  and placed it on the mat between the pair. This, she explained, was an  old custom, and was done so that the girl might not be ashamed, for she  was not the first to sleep there. Having finished this duty, she  returned to the center of the room and placed a number of plates and a  knife on the _tambara_, where they were allowed to remain for four days  as offerings to the _anito_, Manama, Toglai and the _tigyama_.[39] At  the end of that period the plates were attached to the outside walls of  the house, and the knife returned to its former owner. This completed  the duties of the _mabalian_ who returned home carrying an _agong_, the  payment for her services.    [37] Large copper gong.    [38] Much more is often given. One girl in Cibolan brought six horses,  five agongs, and several spears and knives.    [39] See p. 107. [Transcriber's note: 5 pages after this.]    A man may have as many wives as he desires and can afford, but he may  not take a second mate until a child has been born to the first union,  or the wife has been proved beyond doubt to be barren. The groom renders  no services to the father of the second wife, but instead of this pays a  double price for the girl, for he not only pays her parents but is  forced also to give a like sum to his first wife, who, in turn, presents  it to her father. Should a third wife be added to the family a sum equal  to her cost is divided among the earlier wives. The first wife is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#12)"],[1,"ond, where he lurks in seclusion till the eggs  develop. Frogs do not need frequent doses of food--their meals are  often few and far between--and during the six or eight weeks that the  eggs take to mature the father probably eats very little, though he  may possibly sally forth at night, unobserved, in search of provender.  At the end of that time the devoted parent, foreseeing developments,  takes to the water once more, so that the tadpoles may be hatched in  their proper element. I may add that this frog is a great musician in  the breeding season, but that as soon as the tadpoles are hatched out  he loses his voice entirely, and does not recover his manly croak till  the succeeding spring. This is also the case with the song of many  birds, the crest of the newt, the plumes of certain highly-decorated  trogons and nightjars, and, roughly speaking, the decorative and  attractive features of the male sex in general. Such features are  given them during the mating period as allurements for their  consorts: they disappear, for the time at least, like a ball-dress  after a ball, as soon as no immediate use can any longer be made of  them.    [Illustration: POUCHED FROG.]    Some American tree-frogs, on the other hand, imitate rather the  motherly Solenostoma than the fatherly instincts of the pipe-fish or  the stickleback. These pretty little creatures have a pouch like the  kangaroo, but in their case (as in the kangaroo's) it is the female  who bears it. Within this safe receptacle the eggs are placed by the  male, who pushes them in with his hind feet; and they not only undergo  their hatching in the pouch, but also pass through their whole tadpole  development in the same place. Owing to the care which is thus  extended to the eggs and young, these advanced tree-frogs are enabled  to lay only about a dozen to fifteen eggs at a time, instead of the  countless hundreds often produced by many of their relations.    Tree-frogs have, of course, in most circumstances much greater  difficulty in getting at water than pond-frogs; and this is especially  true in certain tropical or desert districts. Hence most of the frogs  which inhabit such regions have had to find out or invent some  ingenious plan for passing through the tadpole stage with a minimum of  moisture. The devices they have hit upon are very curious. Some of  them make use of the little pools collected at the bases of huge  tropical leaf-stalks, like those of the banana plant; others dispense  with the aid of water altogether, and glue their new-laid eggs to  their own backs, where the fry pass through the tadpole stage with the  slimy mucus which surrounds them. Nature always discovers such cunning  schemes to get over apparent difficulties in her way: and the  tree-frogs have solved the problem for themselves in half a dozen  manners in different localities. Oddest of all, perhaps, is the dodge  invented by \"Darwin's frog,\" a Chilean species, in which the male  swallows the eggs as soon as laid, and gulps them into the  throat-pouch beneath his capacious neck: there they hatch out and pass  through their tadpole stage: and when at last they arrive at frogly  maturity, they escape into the world through the mouth of their  father.    [Illustration: NO. 8. THE SURINAM TOAD.]    The Surinam toad, represented in No. 8, is also the possessor of one  of the strangest nurseries known to science. It lives in the dense  tropical forests of Guiana and Brazil, and is a true water-haunter.  But at the breeding season the female undergoes a curious change of  integument. The skin on her back grows pulpy, soft, and jelly-like.  She lays her eggs in the water: but as soon as she has laid them, her  lord and master plasters them on to her impressionable back with his  feet, so as to secure them from all assaults of enemies. Every egg is  pressed separately into a bed of the soft skin, which soon closes over  it automatically, thus burying each in a little cell or niche, where  it undergoes its further development. The tadpoles pass through their  larval stage within the cell, and then hop out, in the four-legged  condition. As soon as they have gone off to shift for themselves, the  mother toad finds herself with a ragged and honeycombed skin, which  must be very uncomfortable. So she rubs the remnant of it off against  stones or the bark of trees, and re-develops a similar back afresh at  the next breeding season.    Almost never do we find a device in nature which occurs once only. The  unique hardly exists: nature is a great copyist. At least two animals  of wholly unlike kinds are all but sure to hit independently upon the  self-same mechanism. So it is not surprising to learn that a cat-fish  has invented an exactly similar mode of carrying its young to that  adopted by the Surinam toad: only, here it is on the under surface,  not the upper one, that the spawn is plastered. The eggs of this  cat-fish, whose scientific name is Aspredo, are pressed into the skin  below the body, and so borne about by the mother till they hatch. This  is the second instance of which I spoke above, where the female fish  herself assumes the care of her offspring, instead of leaving it  entirely to her excellent partner.    Higher up in the scale of life we get many instances which show  various stages in the same progressive development towards greater  care for the safety and education of the young. Among the larger  lizards, for example, a distinct advance may be traced between the  comparatively uncivilized American alligator and his near ally, the  much more cultivated African crocodile. On the banks of the  Mississippi, the alligator lays a hundred eggs or thereabouts, which  she deposits in a nest near the water's edge, and then covers them up  with leaves and other decaying vegetable matter. The fermentation of  these leaves produces heat and so does for the alligator's eggs what  sitting does for those of hens and other birds: the mother deputes her  maternal functions, so to speak, to a festering heap of decomposing  plant-refuse. Nevertheless, she loiters about all the time, like  Miriam round the ark which contained Moses, to see what happens; and  when the eggs hatch out, she leads her little ones down to the river,  and there makes alligators of them. This is a simple and relatively  low stage in the nursery arrangements of the big lizards.    The African crocodile, on the other hand, goes a stage higher. It lays  only about thirty eggs, but these it buries in warm sand, and then  lies on top of them at night, both to protect them from attack and to  keep them warm during the cooler hours. In short, it sits upon them.  When the young crocodiles within the eggs are ready to hatch, they  utter an acute cry. The mother then digs down to the eggs, and lays  them freely on the surface, so that the little reptiles may have space  to work their way out unimpeded. This they do by biting at the shell  with a specially developed tooth; at the end of two hours' nibbling  they are free, and are led down to the water by their affectionate  parent. In these two cases we see the beginnings of the instinct of  hatching, which in birds, the next in order in the scale of being, has  become almost universal.    I say _almost_ universal, because even among birds there are a few  kinds which have not to this day progressed beyond the alligator  level. Australia is the happy hunting-ground of the zooelogist in  search of antiquated forms, elsewhere extinct, and several Australian  birds, such as the brush-turkeys, still treat their eggs essentially  on the alligator method. The cock birds heap up huge mounds of earth  and decaying vegetable matter, as much as would represent several  cartloads of mould; and in this natural hot-bed the hens lay their  eggs, burying each separately with a good stock of leaves around it.  The heat of the sun and the fermenting mould hatch them out between  them; to expedite the process, the birds uncover the eggs during the  warmer part of the day, expose them to the sun, and bury them again in  the hot-beds towards evening. Several intermediate steps may also be  found between this early stage of communal nesting by proxy and the  true hatching instinct; a good one is supplied by the ostrich, which  partially buries its eggs in hot sand, but sits on them at intervals,  both father and mother birds taking shares by turn in the duties of  incubation.    The vast subject which I have thus lightly skimmed is not without  interest, again, from its human implications. Savages as a rule  produce enormous families; but then, the infant mortality in savage  tribes is proportionally great. Among civilized races, families are  smaller, and deaths in infancy are far less numerous. The higher the  class or the natural grade of a stock, the larger as a rule the  proportion of children safely reared to the adult age. The goal  towards which humanity is slowly moving would thus seem to be one  where families in most cases will be relatively small--perhaps not  more on an average than three to a household--but where most or all of  the children brought into the world will be safely reared to full  maturity. This is already becoming the rule in certain favored ranks  of European society.
