It is, of course, true that many of the strong masters had deep  faults of character, but their faults always show in their work. It is  true that some could not govern their passions; if so, they died young,  or they painted ill when old. But the greater part of our  misapprehension in the whole matter is from our not having well known  who the great painters were, and taking delight in the petty skill that  was bred in the fumes of the taverns of the North, instead of theirs who  breathed empyreal air, sons of the morning, under the woods of Assisi  and the crags of Cadore.      73. It is true however also, as I have pointed out long ago, that the  strong masters fall into two great divisions, one leading simple and  natural lives, the other restrained in a Puritanism of the worship of  beauty; and these two manners of life you may recognise in a moment by  their work. Generally the naturalists are the strongest; but there are  two of the Puritans, whose work if I can succeed in making clearly  understandable to you during my three years here, it is all I need care  to do. But of these two Puritans one I cannot name to you, and the other  I at present will not. One I cannot, for no one knows his name, except  the baptismal one, Bernard, or \"dear little Bernard\"--Bernardino, called  from his birthplace, (Luino, on the Lago Maggiore,) Bernard of Luino.  The other is a Venetian, of whom many of you probably have never heard,  and of whom, through me, you shall not hear, until I have tried to get  some picture by him over to England.      74. Observe then, this Puritanism in the worship of beauty, though  sometimes weak, is always honourable and amiable, and the exact reverse  of the false Puritanism, which consists in the dread or disdain of  beauty. And in order to treat my subject rightly, I ought to proceed  from the skill of art to the choice of its subject, and show you how the  moral temper of the workman is shown by his seeking lovely forms and  thoughts to express, as well as by the force of his hand in expression.  But I need not now urge this part of the proof on you, because you are  already, I believe, sufficiently conscious of the truth in this matter,  and also I have already said enough of it in my writings; whereas I have  not at all said enough of the infallibleness of fine technical work as a  proof of every other good power. And indeed it was long before I myself  understood the true meaning of the pride of the greatest men in their  mere execution, shown for a permanent lesson to us, in the stories  which, whether true or not, indicate with absolute accuracy the general  conviction of great artists;--the stories of the contest of Apelles and  Protogenes in a line only, (of which I can promise you, you shall know  the meaning to some purpose in a little while),--the story of the circle  of Giotto, and especially, which you may perhaps not have observed, the  expression of Duerer in his inscription on the drawings sent him by  Raphael. These figures, he says, \"Raphael drew and sent to Albert Duerer  in Nuernberg, to show him\"--What? Not his invention, nor his beauty of  expression, but \"sein Hand zu weisen,\" \"To show him his _hand_.\" And you  will find, as you examine farther, that all inferior artists are  continually trying to escape from the necessity of sound work, and  either indulging themselves in their delights in subject, or pluming  themselves on their noble motives for attempting what they cannot  perform; (and observe, by the way, that a great deal of what is mistaken  for conscientious motive is nothing but a very pestilent, because very  subtle, condition of vanity); whereas the great men always understand at  once that the first morality of a painter, as of everybody else, is to  know his business; and so earnest are they in this, that many, whose  lives you would think, by the results of their work, had been passed in  strong emotion, have in reality subdued themselves, though capable of  the very strongest passions, into a calm as absolute as that of a deeply  sheltered mountain lake, which reflects every agitation of the clouds in  the sky, and every change of the shadows on the hills, but is itself  motionless.      75. Finally, you must remember that great obscurity has been brought  upon the truth in this matter by the want of integrity and simplicity in  our modern life. I mean integrity in the Latin sense, wholeness.  Everything is broken up, and mingled in confusion, both in our habits  and thoughts; besides being in great part imitative: so that you not  only cannot tell what a man is, but sometimes you cannot tell whether  he is, at all!--whether you have indeed to do with a spirit, or only  with an echo. And thus the same inconsistencies appear now, between the  work of artists of merit and their personal characters, as those which  you find continually disappointing expectation in the lives of men of  modern literary power; the same conditions of society having obscured or  misdirected the best qualities of the imagination, both in our  literature and art. Thus there is no serious question with any of us as  to the personal character of Dante and Giotto, of Shakespeare and  Holbein; but we pause timidly in the attempt to analyse the moral laws  of the art skill in recent poets, novelists, and painters.      76. Let me assure you once for all, that as you grow older, if you  enable yourselves to distinguish, by the truth of your own lives, what  is true in those of other men, you will gradually perceive that all good  has its origin in good, never in evil; that the fact of either  literature or painting being truly fine of their kind, whatever their  mistaken aim, or partial error, is proof of their noble origin: and  that, if there is indeed sterling value in the thing done, it has come  of a sterling worth in the soul that did it, however alloyed or defiled  by conditions of sin which are sometimes more appalling or more strange  than those which all may detect in their own hearts, because they are  part of a personality altogether larger than ours, and as far beyond our  judgment in its darkness as beyond our following in its light. And it is  sufficient warning against what some might dread as the probable effect  of such a conviction on your own minds, namely, that you might permit  yourselves in the weaknesses which you imagined to be allied to genius,  when they took the form of personal temptations;--it is surely, I say,  sufficient warning against so mean a folly, to discern, as you may with  little pains, that, of all human existences, the lives of men of that  distorted and tainted nobility of intellect are probably the most  miserable.      77. I pass to the second, and for us the more practically important  question, What is the effect of noble art upon other men; what has it  done for national morality in time past: and what effect is the extended  knowledge or possession of it likely to have upon us now? And here we  are at once met by the facts, which are as gloomy as indisputable, that,  while many peasant populations, among whom scarcely the rudest practice  of art has ever been attempted, have lived in comparative innocence,  honour and happiness, the worst foulness and cruelty of savage tribes  have been frequently associated with fine ingenuities of decorative  design; also, that no people has ever attained the higher stages of art  skill, except at a period of its civilisation which was sullied by  frequent, violent and even monstrous crime; and, lastly, that the  attaining of perfection in art power has been hitherto, in every nation,  the accurate signal of the beginning of its ruin.      78. Respecting which phenomena, observe first, that although good never  springs out of evil, it is developed to its highest by contention with  evil. There are some groups of peasantry, in far-away nooks of Christian  countries, who are nearly as innocent as lambs; but the morality which  gives power to art is the morality of men, not of cattle.    Secondly, the virtues of the inhabitants of many country districts are  apparent, not real; their lives are indeed artless, but not innocent;  and it is only the monotony of circumstances, and the absence of  temptation, which prevent the exhibition of evil passions not less real  because often dormant, nor less foul because shown only in petty faults,  or inactive malignities.      79. But you will observe also that _absolute_ artlessness, to men in any  kind of moral health, is impossible; they have always, at least, the art  by which they live--agriculture or seamanship; and in these industries,  skilfully practised, you will find the law of their moral training;  while, whatever the adversity of circumstances, every rightly-minded  peasantry, such as that of Sweden, Denmark, Bavaria, or Switzerland, has  associated with its needful industry a quite studied school of  pleasurable art in dress; and generally also in song, and simple  domestic architecture.      80. Again, I need not repeat to you here what I endeavoured to explain  in the first lecture in the book I called \"The Two Paths,\" respecting  the arts of savage races: but I may now note briefly that such arts are  the result of an intellectual activity which has found no room to  expand, and which the tyranny of nature or of man has condemned to  disease through arrested growth. And where neither Christianity, nor any  other religion conveying some moral help, has reached, the animal energy  of such races necessarily flames into ghastly conditions of evil, and  the grotesque or frightful forms assumed by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#12)"],[1,"answer that, but once on the doorstep Lorraine turned and  faced him. Quite suddenly it came to her--the knowledge of why she did  not like this man. She stared at him, her eyes wide and bright.    \"Your hat's brown!\" she exclaimed unguardedly. \"I--I saw a man with a  brown hat----\"    He laughed suddenly. \"If you stay around here long you'll see a good  many,\" he said, taking off his hat and turning it on his hand before  her. \"This here hat I traded for yesterday. I had a gray one, but it  didn't suit me. Too narrow in the brim. Brown hats are getting to be the  style. If I can borrow half a dozen matches, Miss Hunter, I'll be  going.\"    Lorraine looked at him again doubtfully and went after the matches. He  thanked her, smiling down at her quizzically. \"A man can get along  without lots of things, but he's plumb lost without matches. You've  maybe saved my life, Miss Hunter, if you only knew it.\"    She watched him as he rode away, opening the gate and letting himself  through without dismounting. He disappeared finally around a small spur  of the hill, and Lorraine found her knees trembling under her.    \"Ket, you're an awful fool,\" she exclaimed fiercely. \"Why did you let me  give myself away to that man? I--I believe he _was_ the man. And if I  really did see him, it wasn't my imagination at all. He saw me there,  perhaps. Ket, I'm scared! I'm not going to stay on this ranch all alone.  I'm going to saddle the family skeleton, and I'm going to ride till  dark. There's something queer about that man from Whisper. I'm afraid  of him.\"    After awhile, when she had finished her breakfast and was putting up a  lunch, Lorraine picked up the nameless gray cat and holding its head  between her slim fingers, looked at it steadily. \"Ket, you're the  humanest thing I've seen since I left home,\" she said wistfully. \"I  _hate_ a country where horrible things happen under the surface and the  top is just gray and quiet and so dull it makes you want to scream. Lone  Morgan lied to me. He lied--he lied!\" She hugged the cat impulsively and  rubbed her cheek absently against it, so that it began purring  immediately.    \"Ket--I'm afraid of that man at Whisper!\" she breathed miserably against  its fur.          CHAPTER EIGHT    \"IT TAKES NERVE JUST TO HANG ON\"      Brit was smoking his pipe after supper and staring at nothing, though  his face was turned toward the closed door. Lorraine had washed the  dishes and was tidying the room and looking at her father now and then  in a troubled, questioning way of which Brit was quite oblivious.    \"Dad,\" she said abruptly, \"who is the man at Whisper?\"    Brit turned his eyes slowly to her face as if he had not grasped her  meaning and was waiting for her to repeat the question. It was evident  that his thoughts had pulled away from something that meant a good deal  to him.    \"Why?\"    \"A man came this morning, and said he was the man at Whisper, and that  he would come again to see you.\"    Brit took his pipe from his mouth, looked at it and crowded down the  tobacco with a forefinger. \"He seen me ride away from the ranch, this  morning,\" he said. \"He was coming down the Whisper trail as I was taking  the fork over to Sugar Spring, Frank and me. What did he say he wanted  to see me about?\"    \"He didn't say. He asked for you and Frank.\" Lorraine sat down and  folded her arms on the oilcloth-covered table. \"Dad, what _is_ Whisper?\"    \"Whisper's a camp up against a cliff, over west of here. It belongs to  the Sawtooth. Is that all he said? Just that he wanted to see me?\"    \"He--talked a little,\" Lorraine admitted, her eyebrows pulled down. \"If  he saw you leave, I shouldn't think he'd come here and ask for you.\"    \"He knowed I was gone,\" Brit stated briefly.    With a finger nail Lorraine traced the ugly, brown pattern on the  oilcloth. It was not easy to talk to this silent man who was her father,  but she had done a great deal of thinking during that long, empty day,  and she had reached the point where she was afraid not to speak.    \"Dad!\"    \"What do you want, Raine?\"    \"Dad, was--has any one around here died, lately?\"    \"Died? Nobody but Fred Thurman, over here on Granite. He was drug with a  horse and killed.\"    Lorraine caught her breath, saw Brit looking at her curiously and moved  closer to him. She wanted to be near somebody just then, and after all,  Brit was her father, and his silence was not the inertia of a dull mind,  she knew. He seemed bottled-up, somehow, and bitter. She caught his hand  and held it, feeling its roughness between her two soft palms.    \"Dad, I've got to tell you. I feel trapped, somehow. Did his horse have  a white face, dad?\"    \"Yes, he's a blaze-faced roan. Why?\" Brit moved uncomfortably, but he  did not take his hand away from her. \"What do you know about it, Raine?\"    \"I saw a man shoot Fred Thurman and push his foot through the stirrup.  And, dad, I believe it was that man at Whisper. The one I saw had on a  brown hat, and this man wears a brown hat--and I was advised not to tell  any one I had been at that place they call Rock City, when the storm  came. Dad, would an innocent man--one that didn't have anything to do  with a crime--would he try to cover it up afterwards?\"    Brit's hand shook when he removed the pipe from his mouth and laid it on  the table. His face had turned gray while Lorraine watched him  fearfully. He laid his hand on her shoulder, pressing down hard--and at  last his eyes met her big, searching ones.    \"If he wanted to _live_--in this country--he'd have to. Leastways, he'd  have to keep his mouth shut,\" he said grimly.    \"And he'd try to shut the mouths of others----\"    \"If he cared anything about them, he would. You ain't told anybody what  you saw, have yuh?\"    Lorraine hid her face against his arm. \"Just Lone Morgan, and he thought  I was crazy and imagined it. That was in the morning, when he found me.  And he--he wanted me to go on thinking it was just a nightmare--that I'd  imagined the whole thing. And I did, for awhile. But this man at Whisper  tried to find out where I was that night----\"    Brit pulled abruptly away from her, got up and opened the door. He  stood there for a time, looking out into the gloom of early nightfall.  He seemed to be listening, Lorraine thought. When he came back to her  his voice was lower, his manner intangibly furtive.    \"You didn't tell him anything, did you?\" he asked, as if there had been  no pause in their talk.    \"No--I made him believe I wasn't there. Or I tried to. And dad! As I was  going to cross that creek just before you come to Rock City, two men  came along on horseback, and I hid before they saw me. They stopped to  water their horses, and they were talking. They said something about the  TJ had been here a long time, but they would get theirs, and it was like  sitting into a poker game with a nickel. They said the little ones  aren't big enough to fight the Sawtooth, and they'd carry lead under  their hides if they didn't leave. Dad, isn't your brand the TJ? That's  what it looks like on Yellowjacket.\"    Brit did not answer, and when Lorraine was sure that he did not mean to  do so, she asked another question. \"Dad, why didn't you want me to leave  the ranch to-day? I was nervous after that man was here, and I did go.\"    \"I didn't want you riding around the country unless I knew where you  went,\" Brit said. \"My brand is the TJ up-and-down. We never call it just  the TJ.\"    \"Oh,\" said Lorraine, relieved. \"They weren't talking about you, then.  But dad--it's horrible! We simply _can't_ let that murder go and not do  anything. Because I know that man was shot. I heard the shot fired, and  I saw him start to fall off his horse. And the next flash of lightning I  saw----\"    \"Look here, Raine. I don't want you talking about what you saw. I don't  want you _thinkin'_ about it. What's the use? Thurman's dead and buried.  The cor'ner come and held an inquest, and the jury agreed it was an  accident. I was on the jury. The sheriff's took charge of his property.  You couldn't prove what you saw, even if you was to try.\" He looked at  her very much as Lone Morgan had looked at her. His next words were very  nearly what Lone Morgan had said, Lorraine remembered. \"You don't know  this country like I know it. Folks live in it mainly because they don't  go around blatting everything they see and hear and think.\"    \"You have laws, don't you, dad? You spoke about the sheriff----\"    \"The sheriff!\" Brit laughed harshly. \"Yes, we got a sheriff, and we got  a jail, and a judge--all the makin's of law. But we ain't got one thing  that goes with it, and that's justice. You'd best make up your mind like  the cor'ner's jury done, that Fred Thurman was drug to death by his  horse. That's all that'll ever be proved, and if you can't prove nothing  else you better keep your mouth shut.\"    Lorraine sprang up and stood facing her father, every nerve taut with  protest. \"You don't mean to tell me, dad, that you and Frank Johnson and  Lone Morgan and--everybody in the country are _cowards_, do you?\"    Brit looked at her patiently. \"No,\" he said in the tone of acknowledged  defeat, \"we ain't cowards, Raine. A man ain't a coward when he stands  with his hands over his head. Most generally it's because some one's got  the drop on 'im.\"    Lorraine would not accept that. \"You think so, because you don't fight,\"  she cried hotly. \"No one is holding a gun at your head. Dad! I thought  Westerners never quit. It's fight to the finish, always. Why, I've seen  one man fight a whole outfit and win. He couldn't be beaten because he  wouldn't give up. Why----\"    Brit gave her a tolerant glance. \"Where'd you see all that, Raine?\" He  moved to the table picked up his pipe and knocked out the ashes on the  stove hearth. His movements were those of an aging man,--yet Brit Hunter  was not old, as age is reckoned.    \"Well--in stories--but it was reasonable and logical and possible,"]]]
