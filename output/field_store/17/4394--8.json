[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#12)"],[1,"fore-ordained unto the peoples and kindreds of the earth is now  come. The promises of God, as recorded in the holy Scriptures, have all  been fulfilled. Out of Zion hath gone forth the Law of God, and Jerusalem,  and the hills and land thereof, are filled with the glory of His  Revelation. Happy is the man that pondereth in his heart that which hath  been revealed in the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.  Meditate upon this, O ye beloved of God, and let your ears be attentive  unto His Word, so that ye may, by His grace and mercy, drink your fill  from the crystal waters of constancy, and become as steadfast and  immovable as the mountain in His Cause.          \"VERILY I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold...\"      VERILY I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold the Face, and  hear the Voice, of the Promised One. The Call of God hath been raised, and  the light of His countenance hath been lifted up upon men. It behoveth  every man to blot out the trace of every idle word from the tablet of his  heart, and to gaze, with an open and unbiased mind, on the signs of His  Revelation, the proofs of His Mission, and the tokens of His glory.    Great indeed is this Day! The allusions made to it in all the sacred  Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. The soul of every  Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this wondrous  Day. All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to  attain it. No sooner, however, had the Day Star of His Revelation  manifested itself in the heaven of God's Will, than all, except those whom  the Almighty was pleased to guide, were found dumbfounded and heedless.    O thou that hast remembered Me! The most grievous veil hath shut out the  peoples of the earth from His glory, and hindered them from hearkening to  His call. God grant that the light of unity may envelop the whole earth,  and that the seal, 'the Kingdom is God's', may be stamped upon the brow of  all its peoples.          \"O YE children of men! The fundamental purpose animating...\"      O YE children of men! The fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God  and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of  the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst  men. Suffer it not to become a source of dissension and discord, of hate  and enmity. This is the straight Path, the fixed and immovable foundation.  Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the  world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless  centuries undermine its structure. Our hope is that the world's religious  leaders and the rulers thereof will unitedly arise for the reformation of  this age and the rehabilitation of its fortunes. Let them, after  meditating on its needs, take counsel together and, through anxious and  full deliberation, administer to a diseased and sorely-afflicted world the  remedy it requires.... It is incumbent upon them who are in authority to  exercise moderation in all things. Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of  moderation will cease to exert a beneficial influence. Consider for  instance such things as liberty, civilization and the like. However much  men of understanding may favourably regard them, they will, if carried to  excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon men.... Please God, the  peoples of the world may be led, as the result of the high endeavours  exerted by their rulers and the wise and learned amongst men, to recognize  their best interests. How long will humanity persist in its waywardness?  How long will injustice continue? How long is chaos and confusion to reign  amongst men? How long will discord agitate the face of society? The winds  of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife that  divideth and afflicteth the human race is daily increasing. The signs of  impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the  prevailing order appeareth to be lamentably defective. I beseech God,  exalted be His glory, that He may graciously awaken the peoples of the  earth, may grant that the end of their conduct may be profitable unto  them, and aid them to accomplish that which beseemeth their station.          \"O CONTENDING peoples and kindreds of the earth! Set...\"      O CONTENDING peoples and kindreds of the earth! Set your faces towards  unity, and let the radiance of its light shine upon you. Gather ye  together, and for the sake of God resolve to root out whatever is the  source of contention amongst you. Then will the effulgence of the world's  great Luminary envelop the whole earth, and its inhabitants become the  citizens of one city, and the occupants of one and the same throne. This  wronged One hath, ever since the early days of His life, cherished none  other desire but this, and will continue to entertain no wish except this  wish. There can be no doubt whatever that the peoples of the world, of  whatever race or religion, derive their inspiration from one heavenly  Source, and are the subjects of one God. The difference between the  ordinances under which they abide should be attributed to the varying  requirements and exigencies of the age in which they were revealed. All of  them, except a few which are the outcome of human perversity, were  ordained of God, and are a reflection of His Will and Purpose. Arise and,  armed with the power of faith, shatter to pieces the gods of your vain  imaginings, the sowers of dissension amongst you. Cleave unto that which  draweth you together and uniteth you. This, verily, is the most exalted  Word which the Mother Book hath sent down and revealed unto you. To this  beareth witness the Tongue of Grandeur from His habitation of glory.          \"THE Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of...\"      THE Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and  tranquillity of the world and the advancement of its peoples, hath  written: The time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding  of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally  realized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and,  participating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as  will lay the foundations of the world's Great Peace amongst men. Such a  peace demandeth that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the  tranquillity of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled among  themselves. Should any king take up arms against another, all should  unitedly arise and prevent him. If this be done, the nations of the world  will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving  the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within  their territories. This will ensure the peace and composure of every  people, government and nation. We fain would hope that the kings and  rulers of the earth, the mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of God,  may attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught of  tyranny.... The day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will  have adopted one universal language and one common script. When this is  achieved, to whatsoever city a man may journey, it shall be as if he were  entering his own home. These things are obligatory and absolutely  essential. It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to  strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and  action.... That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the  service of the entire human race. The Great Being saith: Blessed and happy  is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and  kindreds of the earth. In another passage He hath proclaimed: It is not  for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him  who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its  citizens.          \"THE All-Knowing Physician hath His finger on the...\"      THE All-Knowing Physician hath His finger on the pulse of mankind. He  perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom, the  remedy. Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular  aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions  can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be  anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your  deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.    We can well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed with great,  with incalculable afflictions. We see it languishing on its bed of  sickness, sore-tried and disillusioned. They that are intoxicated by  self-conceit have interposed themselves between it and the Divine and  infallible Physician. Witness how they have entangled all men, themselves  included, in the mesh of their devices. They can neither discover the  cause of the disease, nor have they any knowledge of the remedy. They have  conceived the straight to be crooked, and have imagined their friend an  enemy.    Incline your ears to the sweet melody of this Prisoner. Arise, and lift up  your voices, that haply they that are fast asleep may be awakened. Say: O  ye who are as dead! The Hand of Divine bounty proffereth unto you the  Water of Life. Hasten and drink your fill. Whoso hath been re-born in this  Day, shall never die; whoso remaineth dead, shall never live.          \"O PEOPLES of the earth! God, the Eternal Truth, is My...\"      O PEOPLES of the earth! God, the Eternal Truth, is My witness that streams  of fresh and soft-flowing waters have gushed from the rocks, through the  sweetness of the words uttered by your Lord, the Unconstrained; and still  ye slumber. Cast away that which ye possess, and, on the wings of  detachment, soar beyond all created things. Thus biddeth you the Lord of  creation, the movement of Whose Pen hath revolutionized the soul of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16996"],[0,"Two Old Faiths (#12)"],[1,"a garden, the ground of wrought gold, the walks of  silver, the meadows of emeralds, rivulets of pearls, and flowers and  fruits of diamonds, rubies, and rare gems. The precious metals lost  their conventional value, gold was parted with for its weight in silver;  and so on.[43]    [Sidenote: Success in battle ascribed to divine aid.]  It is the virtue of Islam that it recognizes a special providence,  seeing the hand of God, as in every thing, so pre-eminently also in  victory. When Sad, therefore, had established himself in the palace of  the Chosroes he was not forgetful to render thanks in a service of  praise. One of the princely mansions was turned for the moment into a  temple, and there, followed by his troops, he ascribed the victory to  the Lord of Hosts. The lesson accompanying the prayers was taken from a  Sura (or chapter of the Koran) which speaks of Pharaoh and his riders  being overwhelmed in the Red Sea, and contains this passage, held to be  peculiarly appropriate to the occasion:        \"How many gardens and fountains did they leave behind,        And fields of corn, and fair dwelling-places,      And pleasant things which they enjoyed!        Even thus have We made another people to inherit the same.\"[44]    [Sidenote: \"Martyrdom\" in the field coveted by Moslem crusaders.  The Moslem crown of martyrdom.]  Such as fell in the conflict were called martyrs; a halo of glory  surrounded them, and special joys awaited them even on the battlefield.  And so it came to pass that the warriors of Islam had an unearthly  longing for the crown of martyrdom. The Caliph Omar was inconsolable at  the loss of his brother, Zeid, who fell in the fatal \"Garden of Death,\"  at the battle of Yemama: \"Thou art returned home,\" he said to his son,  Abdallah, \"safe and sound, and Zeid is dead. Wherefore wast not thou  slain before him? I wish not to see thy face.\" \"Father,\" answered  Abdallah, \"he asked for the crown of martyrdom, and the Lord granted it.  I strove after the same, but it was not given unto me.\"[45] It was the  proud boast of the Saracens in their summons to the craven Greeks and  Persians that \"they loved death more than their foes loved life.\"  Familiar with the pictures drawn in the Koran of the beautiful  \"houries\" of Paradise,[46] the Saracens believed that immediate fruition  on the field of battle was the martyr's special prize. We are told of a  Moslem soldier, four-score years of age, who, seeing a comrade fall by  his side, cried out, \"O Paradise! how close art thou beneath the arrow's  point and the falchion's flash! O Hashim! even now I see heaven opened,  and black-eyed maidens all bridally attired, clasping thee in their fond  embrace.\" And shouting thus the aged warrior, fired again with the ardor  of youth, rushed upon the enemy and met the envied fate. For those who  survived there was the less ethereal but closer prospect of Persian,  Greek, or Coptic women, both maids and matrons, who, on \"being taken  captive by their right hand,\" were forthwith, according to the Koran,  without stint of number, at the conqueror's will and pleasure. These,  immediately they were made prisoners, might (according to the example  of Mohammed himself at Kheibar) be carried off without further ceremony  to the victor's tent; and in this respect the Saracens certainly were  nothing loath to execute upon the heathen the judgment written in their  law. So strangely was religious fanaticism fed and fostered in the  Moslem camp by incentives irresistible to the Arab--fight and foray, the  spoil of war and captive charms.    [Sidenote: Martial passages from Koran recited on field of battle.]  The courage of the troops was stimulated by the divine promises of  victory, which were read (and on like occasions still are read) at the  head of each column drawn up for battle. Thus, on the field of Cadesiya[d],  which decided the fate of Persia, the Sura _Jehad_, with the stirring  tale of the thousand angels that fought on the Prophet's side at Bedr  was recited, and such texts as these:    _Stir up the faithful unto battle. If there be twenty steadfast among  you they shall put two hundred to flight of the unbelievers, and a  hundred shall put to flight a thousand. Victory is from the Lord. He is  mighty and wise. I the Lord will cast terror into the hearts of the  infidels. Strike off their heads and their fingers' ends. Beware lest ye  turn your back in battle. Verily, he that turneth his back shall draw  down upon himself the wrath of God. His abode shall be hell fire; an  evil journey thither._    And we are told that on the recital of these verses \"the heart of the  people was refreshed and their eyes lightened, and they felt the  tranquillity that ensueth thereupon.\" Three days they fought, and on the  morning of the fourth, returning with unabated vigor to the charge, they  scattered to the winds the vast host of Persia.[47]    [Sidenote: Defeat of Byzantine army on the Yermuk, A.D. 634.]  Nor was it otherwise in the great battle of the Yermuk, which laid Syria  at the feet of the Arabs. The virgin vigor of the Saracens was fired by  a wild fanatical zeal \"to fight in the ways of the Lord,\" obtaining thus  heavenly merit and a worldly prize--the spoil of Syria and its fair  maidens ravished from their homes; or should they fall by the sword, the  black-eyed houries waiting for them on the field of battle. \"Of warriors  nerved by this strange combination of earth and heaven, of the flesh and  of the spirit, of the incentives at once of faith and rapine, of  fanatical devotion to the prophet and deathless passion for the sex, ten  might chase a hundred half-hearted Romans. The forty thousand Moslems  were stronger far than the two hundred and forty thousand of the enemy.\"  The combat lasted for weeks; but at the last the Byzantine force was  utterly routed, and thousands hurled in wild confusion over the beetling  cliffs of the Yermuk into the yawning chasm of Wacusa.[48]    [Sidenote: Islam planted by aid of material force.]  Such, then, was the nature of the Moslem propaganda, such the agency by  which the faith was spread, and such the motives at once material and  spiritual by which its martial missionaries were inspired. No wonder  that the effete empires of Rome and Persia recoiled and quivered at the  shock, and that province after province quickly fell under the sway of  Islam. It is far from my intention to imply that the truths set forth by  the new faith had nothing to do with its success. On the contrary, it  may well be admitted that but for those truths success might have been  impossible. The grand enunciation of the Divine Unity, and the duty of  an absolute submission to the same; the recognition of a special  providence reaching to the minutest details of life; the inculcation of  prayer and other religious duties; the establishment of a code in which  the leading principles of morality are enforced, and the acknowledgment  of previous revelations in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, told  not only on the idolaters of Arabia and the fire-worshipers of Persia,  but on Jews and Samaritans and the followers of a debased and  priest-ridden Christianity. All this is true; but it is still not the  less true that without the sword Islam would never have been planted  even in Arabia, much less ever have spread to the countries beyond. The  weapons of its warfare were \"carnal,\" material, and earthly; and by them  it conquered.    [Sidenote: Alternatives offered to the conquered nations: Islam, the  Sword, or Tribute.]  The pressure brought to bear on the inhabitants of the countries overrun  by Saracen arms was of the most stringent character. They were offered  the triple alternative--Islam, the Sword, or Tribute. The first brought  immediate relief. Acceptance of the faith not only stayed the enemy's  hand, and conferred immunity from the perils of war, but associated the  convert with his conquerors in the common brotherhood and in all the  privileges of Islam.    [Sidenote: Acceptance of Islam, immediate relief from the sword.]  Reading the story of the spread of Islam, we are constantly told of this  and that enemy, that \"being beaten, he _believed_ and embraced the  faith.\" Take as an example of an every-day occurrence the story of  Hormuzan. A Persian prince of high rank long maintained a border  warfare against the Moslems. At last he was taken prisoner and sent in  chains to Medina. As he was conducted into the Great Mosque, Omar  exclaimed, \"Blessed be the Lord, that hath humbled this man and the like  of him!\" He bade them disrobe the prisoner and clothe him in sackcloth.  Then, whip in hand, he upbraided him for his oft-repeated attacks and  treachery. Hormuzan made as if fain to reply; then gasping, like one  faint from thirst, he begged for water to drink. \"Give it him,\" said the  caliph, \"and let him drink in peace.\" \"Nay,\" cried the wretched captive,  trembling, \"I fear to drink, lest some one slay me unawares.\" \"Thy life  is safe,\" said Omar, \"until thou hast drunk the water up.\" The words  were no sooner said than Hormuzan emptied the vessel on the ground. \"I  wanted not the water,\" he said, \"but quarter, and thou hast given it  me.\" \"Liar!\" cried Omar, angrily, \"thy life is forfeit.\" \"But not,\"  interposed the by-standers, \"until he drink the water up.\" \"Strange,\"  said Omar, \"the fellow hath deceived me; and yet I cannot spare the life  of one who hath slain so many noble Moslems. I swear that thou shalt not  gain by thy deceit unless thou wilt forthwith embrace Islam.\" Upon  that, \"_believing_, he made profession of the true faith upon the spot;\"  and thenceforth, residing at Medina, he received a pension of the  highest grade.[49]    [Sidenote: Tribute and humiliation.  Disabilities imposed on Jews and Christians.]  On the other hand, for those who held to their ancestral faith there was  no escape from the second or the third alternative.
