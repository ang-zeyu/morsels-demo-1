In the throne room now the American alumni were to present their  addresses to the Pope. As we entered, undergraduates of the college were  discovered already there singing. Until the addresses were read, the  singing was continued. It was all a magnificent sight, the little white  father on his splendid throne, his court about him, his special body  servant holding his red cape (to be used in case of drafts), and, as a  background for all the colors of the court scene, several hundred  black-robed priests.    Monseigneur Kennedy, rector of the college, read an address, as did Rev.  Father Wall of Baltimore, president of the association. To these the  Pope replied, reading from a manuscript. After this, he rose, mingled  with his entourage, and chatted pleasantly with bishops and others. A  picture was then taken of the court, the priests and students. These  American priests and undergraduates were a fine company of men. The Pope  finally gave his blessing to all who were assembled in the room, and the  great function was over.          THE ASCENT OF THE DOME OF ST. PETER'S[20]    BY GEORGE STILLMAN HILLARD      The visitor to St. Peter's should not fail to ascend to the dome; a long  journey, but involving no danger and not a great amount of fatigue. From  the church to the roof the passage is by an inclined plane of pavement,  with so gradual an ascent that loaded mules pass up without difficulty.  In stepping out upon the roof, it is difficult to believe that we are  more than one hundred and fifty feet from the ground, or that so  extensive an architectural surface could have been reared in air by the  patient labor of men's hands. It rather seems as if a little village had  been lifted up by some geological convulsion. Here are wide spaces to  walk about in, houses for human habitation, a fountain playing, and all  the signs of life. The views are everywhere fine, and one can fancy that  the air is purer and the sky more blue than to those left below. The  dome soars high above the eye, and a new sense of its magnitude seizes  upon the mind. The two cupolas which flank the facade are upward of one  hundred feet high, and the five smaller ones which crown the chapels are  of great size; but here they seem like dwarfs clinging about a giant's  knee.    The dome of St. Peter's, as is well known, is double; and between the  outer and inner wall is a series of winding passages and staircases, by  which the ascent is made to the top. The length of these passages and  staircases, their number, and the time it takes to traverse them, are a  new revelation of the size of this stupendous structure. We begin to  comprehend the genius and courage which planned and executed a work so  novel and so bold. From the galleries inside, the view of the interior  below is most striking. It looks as the earth may look from a balloon.  The men moving upon the pavement appear like that \"small infantry warred  on by cranes\"; and even the baldacchino hardly swells beyond the  dimensions of a candelabrum.    At the base of the ball, a railing, unseen from below, enables the  visitor whose nerves are tolerably good to enjoy an extensive and  beautiful prospect, embracing a region interesting not merely to the eye  but to the mind: the cradle of that mighty Roman race which here began  its ever-widening circle of conquest and annexation. It comprises the  Campagna, the Tiber, the distant Mediterranean, the Apennines, the Alban  and Sabine hills, and the isolated bulk of Soracte. From no point on  earth can the eye rest upon so many spots on which the undying light of  human interest lingers.    From this place the ascent is made to the interior of the ball itself,  into which most travelers climb, probably more for the sake of saying  that they have been there than anything else. Tho the ball looks like a  mere point from below, it is nearly eight feet in diameter; and the  interior will hold a dozen persons without inconvenience. Altho I  visited it on a winter's day, the atmosphere was extremely hot and  uncomfortable, from the effect of the sun's rays upon the gilded bronze.  By means of an exterior ladder, it is possible to climb to the foot of  the cross; a feat which few landsmen would have the nerve to undertake.          SANTA MARIA MAGGIORE[21]    BY HIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE      We followed the street which ascends and descends, bordered with palaces  and old hedges of thorn, as far as Santa Maria Maggiore. This basilica,  standing upon a large eminence, surmounted with its domes, rises nobly  upward, at once simple and complete, and when you enter it, it affords  still greater pleasure. It belongs to the fifth century; on being  rebuilt at a later period, the general plan, its antique idea, was  preserved. An ample nave, with a horizontal roof, is sustained by two  rows of white Ionic columns. You are rejoiced to see so fine an effect  obtained by such simple means; you might almost imagine yourself in a  Greek temple.    It is said that a temple of Juno was robbed of these columns. Each of  them bare and polished, with no other ornament than the delicate curves  of its small capital, is of healthful and charming beauty. You  appreciate here the good sense, and all that is agreeable in genuine  natural construction, the file of trunks of trees which bear the beams,  resting flat and providing a long walk. All that has since been added is  barbarous, and first, the two chapels of Sixtus V. and Paul V., with  their paintings by Guido, Josepin, and Cigoli, and the sculptures of  Bernini, and the architecture of Fontana and Flaminio. These are  celebrated names, and money has been prodigally spent, but instead of  the slight means with which the ancients produced a great effect, the  moderns produce a petty effect with great means.    When the bewildered eye is satiated with the elaborate sweep of these  arches and domes, with the splendors of polychromatic marbles, with  friezes and pedestals of agate, with columns of oriental jasper, with  angels hanging by their feet, and with all these bas-reliefs of bronze  and gold, the visitor hastens to get away from it as he would to escape  from a confectioner's shop. It seems as if this grand, glittering box,  gilded and labored from pavement to lantern, caught up and tore at every  point of its finery the delicate web of poetic reverie; the slender  profile of the least of the columns impresses one far more than any of  this display of the art of upholsterers and parvenus. Similarly to this  the facade, loaded with balustrades, and round and angular pediments,  and statues roosting on its stones, is a \"hotel-de-ville\" frontage.    The campanile, belonging to the fourteenth century, alone presents an  agreeable object; at that time it was one of the towers of the city, a  distinctive sign which marked it on the old plans so black and sharp,  and stamped it forever on the still corporeal imaginations of monks and  wayfarers. There are traces of every age in these old basilicas; you see  the diverse states of Christianity, at first enshrined in pagan forms,  and then traversing the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to muffle itself  up finally, and bedeck itself with modern finery. The Byzantine epoch  has left its imprint in the mosaics of the great nave and the apsis,  and in its bloodless and lifeless Christs and Virgins, so many staring  specters motionless on their gold backgrounds and red panels, the  fantoms of an extinct art and a vanished society.          CATACOMBS AND CRYPTS[22]    BY CHARLES DICKENS      There is an upper chamber in the Mamertine prison, over what is said to  have been--and very possibly may have been--the dungeon of St. Peter.  This chamber is now fitted up as an oratory, dedicated to that saint;  and it lives, as a distinct and separate place, in my recollection, too.  It is very small and low-roofed; and the dread and gloom of the  ponderous, obdurate old prison are on it, as if they had come up in a  dark mist through the floor. Hanging on the walls, among the clustered  votive offerings, are objects, at once strangely in keeping, and  strangely at variance, with the place--rusty daggers, knives, pistols,  clubs, divers instruments of violence and murder, brought here, fresh  from use, and hung up to propitiate offended Heaven; as if the blood  upon them would drain off in consecrated air, and have no voice to cry  with. It is all so silent and so close, and tomb-like; and the dungeons  below are so black and stealthy, and stagnant, and naked; that this  little dark spot becomes a dream within a dream; and in the vision of  great churches which come rolling past me like a sea, it is a small  wave by itself, that melts into no other wave, and does not flow on with  the rest.    It is an awful thing to think of the enormous caverns that are entered  from some Roman churches, and undermine the city. Many churches have  crypts and subterranean chapels of great size, which, in the ancient  time, were baths, and secret chambers of temples, and what not; but I do  not speak of them. Beneath the church of St. Giovanni and St. Paolo,  there are the jaws of a terrific range of caverns, hewn out of the rock,  and said to have another outlet underneath the Coliseum--tremendous  darknesses of vast extent, half-buried in the earth and unexplorable,  where the dull torches, flashed by the attendants, glimmer down long  ranges of distant vaults branching to the right and left, like streets  in a city of the dead; and show the cold damp stealing down the walls,  drip-drop, drip-drop, to join the pools of water that lie here and  there, and never saw, and never will see, one ray of sun. Some accounts  make these the prisons of the wild beasts destined for the amphitheater;  some, the prisons of the condemned gladiators; some, both. But the  legend most appalling to the fancy is, that in the upper range (for  there are two stories"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#12)"],[1,"been sent by an absent man to hunt his  enemies was a eerie puzzle.    \"Lumbrilo is not here.\" Nymani's thoughts must have been moving along  the same path.    Dane could hear movements in the dark beside him.    \"There's a long-distance com unit in that third hut,\" Tau observed.    \"So I see,\" Jellico snapped. \"Could you reach your men over the mountain  with that, sir?\"    \"I do not know. But if Lumbrilo is not here, how can he make his image  walk the night?\" the Chief Ranger demanded impatiently.    \"We shall see. If Lumbrilo is not here--he shall come.\" And the promise  in Tau's tone was sure. \"Those off-worlders will have to be out of  action first. And with that walking thing sent to drive us in, they must  be waiting for us.\"    \"If they have sentries out, I will silence them!\" promised Nymani.    \"You have a plan?\" Asaki's wide shoulders and upheld head showed for an  instant against the light from the camp.    \"You want Lumbrilo,\" Tau replied. \"Very well, sir, I believe I can give  him to you, and in the doing discredit him with your Khatkans. But not  with the off-worlders free to move.\"    The program was not going to be easy, Dane decided. Every one of the  poachers was armed with a Patrol blaster of the latest type, and a small  part of his mind speculated as to what would be the result of that  information conveyed to official quarters. Free Traders and Patrolmen  did not always see eye-to-eye over the proper action to be taken on the  galactic frontier. The _Queen's_ crew had had one such brush with  authority in the immediate past. But each realized that the other had an  important role in the general scheme of things, and if it came to a  clash between the law and outlaws, Free Traders fought beside the  Patrol.    \"Why not give them what they expect--with reservations?\" inquired  Jellico. \"They've set us up to be stampeded into camp, flying ahead of  that tame ghost of theirs. Suppose we do stampede--after Nymani has  removed any sentries--stampede so well we sweep right over them? I want  to get at that com unit.\"    \"You don't think they'll just mow us down as we come in?\"    \"You delivered a blow to Lumbrilo's pride; he won't be satisfied with  just your burning,\" the captain answered Tau, \"not if I'm any judge of  character. And we'd furnish hostages of a sort--especially the Chief  Ranger. No, if they had wanted to kill us they would have shot us off  those islands when we came here. There would have been no playing around  with ghosts and goblins.\"    \"There is reason in your words. And it is true they would like to have  me, those outlaws down there,\" Asaki commented. \"I am of the Magawaya  and we have pressed always for stronger security methods to be used  against such as they. But I do not see how we can take the camp.\"    \"We won't go in from the front--as they expect us to do. But a try from  the north, getting at the off-worlders first.... Three men causing  enough disturbance to cover operations of the other two....\"    \"So?\" There was a moment of silence as the Chief Ranger evaluated that.  Then he added a few comments of his own.    \"That off-worlder who wears spaceman's clothing, his weapon is not  drawn, though the others are ready. But I believe that you are right in  thinking they expect to be warned by sentries. Those we can see to.  Suppose then, Captain, you and I play the fear-crazed men running from  demons. Nymani will cover us from the dark and your two men--\"    Tau spoke up, \"Give me leave to flush out our other quarry, sir. I  believe I can keep him occupied. Dane, you'll take the drum.\"    \"Drum?\" With his mind on blasters, it was startling to be offered a  noise-maker.    \"It's your business to get that drum. And when you get it I want you to  beat out 'Terra Bound.' You certainly can play that, can't you?\"    \"I don't understand,\" Dane began and then swallowed the rest of his  protest, knowing that Tau was not going to explain why he needed to have  the hackneyed popular song of the spaceways played in a Khatkan swamp.  As a Free Trader he had had quite a few odd jobs handed him during the  past couple of years, but this was the first time he had been ordered to  serve as a musician.    They waited for Nymani through dragging minutes. Surely those in the  camp would expect their arrival soon now? Dane's fire ray was in his  hand as he measured the distance to the drummer's stand.    \"It is done,\" Nymani whispered from the darkness behind them. Jellico  and the Chief Ranger moved to the left; Tau crept to the right and Dane  pushed level with the medic.    \"When they move,\" Tau's lips were beside his ear, \"jump for that drum. I  don't care how you get it, but get it and keep it!\"    \"Yes, sir!\"    There was a wailing cry from the north, a howl of witless fear. The  singers stopped in mid-note, the drummer paused, his hand uplifted. Dane  darted forward in a plunge which carried him to that man. The Khatkan  did not have time to rise from his knees as the barrel of the fire rod  struck his head, sending him spinning. Then the drum was cradled in the  spaceman's arm, close to his chest, his weapon aimed across it at the  startled natives.    The crackle of blaster fire, the shrill whine of needlers in action,  raised a bedlam from the other end of the camp. Backing up a little,  Dane went down on one knee, his weapon ready to sweep over the  bewildered natives, the drum resting on the earth against his body.  Keeping the fire rod steady, his left hand went to work, not in the  muted cadence the Khatkan drummer had chosen, but in hard and vigorous  thumps which rolled across the clamor of the fight. There was no  forgetting the beat of \"Terra Bound\" and he delivered it with force, so  that the familiar da-dah-da-da droned loud enough to awaken the whole  camp.    Dane's move appeared to completely baffle the Khatkan outlaws. They  stared at him, the whites of their eyes doubly noticeable in their dark  faces, their mouths a little agape. As usual the unexpected had driven  them off guard. He dared not look away from that gathering to see how  the fight at the other end of the camp was progressing. But he did see  Tau's advance.    The medic came into the light of the fire, not with his ordinary  loose-limbed spaceman's stride, but mincingly, with a dancing step, and  he was singing to the drum beat of \"Terra Bound.\" Dane could not  understand the words, but he knew that they patterned in and out of the  drum beats, weaving a net between singer and listeners as Lumbrilo had  woven his net on the mountain terrace.    Tau had them! Had every one of the native outlaws ensnared, so that Dane  rested his weapon across his knee and took up the lower beat with the  fingers of his right hand as well.    _Da-dah-da-da_.... The innocuous repetitive refrain of the original song  which had been repeating itself in his mind faded, and somehow he  caught the menace in the new words Tau was mouthing.    Twice the medic shuffled about a circle of his own making. Then he  stooped, took a hunting knife from the belt of the nearest Khatkan and  held it point out toward the dark east. Dane would not have believed the  medic knew the drill he now displayed, for with no opponent save the  dancing firelight he fought a knife duel, feinting, striking, twisting,  retreating, attacking, all in time to the beat of the drum Dane was no  longer conscious of playing. And as he strove it was very easy to  picture another fighting against him. So that when the knife came up in  a vicious thrust which was the finish of his last attack, Dane stared  stupidly at the ground, half expecting to see a body lying there.    Once more Tau ceremoniously saluted with his blade to the east. Then he  laid it on the ground and stood astride its gleaming length.    \"Lumbrilo!\" His confident voice arose above the call of the drum.  \"Lumbrilo--I am waiting.\"          VIII      Vaguely aware that the clamor at the other end of the camp had died  away, Dane muted the sound of his drum. Over its round top he could  watch the Khatkan outlaws; their heads bobbed and swayed in time to the  beat of his fingers. He, too, could feel the pull of Tau's voice. But  what would come in answer? That shadowy thing which had been loosed to  drive them here? Or the man himself?    To Dane, the ruddy light of the fire dimmed, yet there was no actual  dying of those flames which coiled and thrust around the wood. And the  acrid scent of burning was thick. How much of what followed was real,  how much the product of his tense nerves, Dane was never afterwards able  to tell. In fact, whether all the witnesses there saw the same sights  could be questioned. Did each man, Khatkan and off-worlder, see only  what his particular set of emotions and memories dictated?    Something swept in from the east, something which was not as tangible as  the creature born of swamp mist. Rather it came as an unseen menace to  the fire, and all that fire signifies to human kind--security,  comradeship, a weapon against the age-old forces of the dangerous night.  Was that threat, too, only in their minds? Or had Lumbrilo some power to  so shape his hatred?    The unseen was cold; it sapped a man's strength, bit at his brain,  weighted his hands and feet, weakened him. It strove to soften him into  clay another could remold. Nothingness, darkness, all that was opposed  to life and warmth and reality, arose in the night, gathered together  against them.    Yet still Tau fronted that invisible wave, his head high. And between  his sturdily planted feet the knife gleamed bright with a radiance of  its own.    \"Ahhh--\" Tau's voice curled out, to pierce that creeping menace. Then he  was singing again, the cadence of his unknown words rising a little  above the pattern wrought by the drum.    Dane forced his heavy hands to continue the beat, his wrists to rise and  fall in defiance of that which crept to eat their strength and make them  less then men.    \""]]]
