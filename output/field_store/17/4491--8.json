[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#12)"],[1," the bird  depicted on Pl. 28, fig. 2, will probably identify it as a vulture, and,  if the square ornament above the beak certainly is part of the figure,  it is unquestionably the king vulture. The knob is not, however, clearly  on the bird's beak. There are two interesting glyphs which occur on the  eastern facade of the Monjas at Chichen Itza. The glyphs in this  inscription are unlike the usual Maya hieroglyphs, although several of  the so-called constellation signs can be made out. The two glyphs in  question represent the entire body possibly of a vulture, that on Pl.  17, fig. 13, probably the king vulture, and that on Pl. 18, fig. 14, the  black vulture.    HARPY EAGLE (_Thrasaetos harpyia_). In the Nuttall Codex, what is  undoubtedly the harpy eagle is of frequent occurrence. This great bird  is not uncommon in the forests of southern Mexico and Central America,  and must have attracted the notice of the people from its size. The  elongated feathers at the back of the head form a conspicuous crest, a  feature that characterizes this species in most of the representations.  A stone carving from Chichen Itza (Pl. 20, fig. 10) pictures a harpy  eagle eating an egg-shaped object, and another similarly engaged is  copied from the Codex Vaticanus 3773 (Pl. 20, fig. 14). The former is  considered to be a vulture by Maudslay, but the presence of feathers  covering the head excludes this interpretation. In two stone glyphs (Pl.  20, fig. 1, 3), occurs a large bird apparently devouring something held  in its talons, as in Pl. 20, fig. 10. From this general resemblance, it  seems probable that both represent the harpy, although no crests are  shown on the glyphs. In the Dresden and the Tro-Cortesianus occur a few  figures of crested birds that probably are the same species. The crest  feathers are reduced to two, however, or, in some cases, what may be a  third projecting forward from the base of the bill (Pl. 20, figs. 5, 7,  12, 13). The last two figures are not certainly identifiable, though it  is probable that they represent the harpy.    The eagle seems to be the bird associated with warriors in the codices.  Seler (1900-1901, p. 89) notes that the eagle and the jaguar are both  the mark of brave warriors among the Nahuas. In the Aubin manuscript,  the warrior god, _Yaotl_, is always associated with the eagle  (_quauhtli_). In the Maya pantheon, god M is usually considered the war  god, as he is almost always armed with a spear. He is seen in Dresden 74  (Pl. 20, fig. 13), and in Tro-Cortesianus 109c with an eagle as a  head-dress. There are other gods, however, who wear a similar head  covering. God L appears in Dresden 14b (Pl. 20, fig. 7) and again in 14c  (Pl. 20, fig. 5) with an eagle head-dress. God D in Dresden 23c (Pl. 20,  fig. 11) has an eagle coming from a _Tun_ sign on top of his head. The  eagle is probably represented at the prow of a boat in Dresden 43c (Pl.  20, fig. 12) in which god B is rowing. In Tro-Cortesianus 88c (Pl. 20,  fig. 4), a bird which may represent the eagle appears sitting on a  _Cimi_ (death) sign. Above in the glyphs the character for the south is  shown. Here, clearly, there is some connection between the signs of the  cardinal points in the line of glyphs and the various creatures pictured  below.    There seems to be only one glyph which can in any way be taken for that  of the eagle in the Maya manuscripts and this appears only once, in  Tro-Cortesianus 107c (Pl. 20, fig. 9). This identification may be  questioned, as there is no drawing of an eagle associated with the  glyph. Attention has already been called to the two stone glyphs in Pl.  20, figs. 1, 3. There are various drawings of the glyph for the eagle in  the Nahua and Zapotecan codices (Pl. 20, fig. 8), as the Nahua day,  _Quauhtli_, has the meaning eagle. It is interesting to note in the  glyph from the Nuttall Codex (Pl. 20, fig. 8) the tips of the feathers  are crowned with stone points, a frequent way of representing birds of  prey among the Mexican peoples.    YUCATAN HORNED OWL (_Bubo virginianus mayensis_). Stempell makes a  serious mistake by confusing the eared owl shown in full face with that  shown in profile in the drawings, for he considers both to represent the  great horned owl. The figures are, however, quite different in every  way. The owl in full face view is unquestionably the great horned owl  (Maya, _ikim_), the Yucatan form of which is recognized by the  subspecific title _mayensis_. This is the bird opposed to the  \"Moan-bird\" which, as will be shown later, is associated with death. In  Pl. 21 are some truly remarkable figures which seem to represent this  horned owl, the first modelled in stucco from Palenque, the second  carved in stone from Yaxchilan, and the third carved in wood from Tikal.  Figs. 1 and 3 show the bird in flight with extended wings. The two  erectile tufts of feathers or \"horns\" are conspicuously represented in  fig. 3, at either side of the bird's head and between them the flat top  of the crown is secondarily divided in like manner into three parts,  representing the \"horns\" and the top of the head. The beetling brows,  heavy hooked beak, and spread talons combine to give a fierce and  spirited mien to the great bird. Pl. 21, fig. 2, may be a greatly  conventionalized owl in which the essential characteristics of the bird  are reproduced in a rectangular design. The large bill is conspicuous in  the center, and in each upper corner terminates one of the ears. The  eyes are represented by rectangular areas at the base of the bill, each  with three vertical bars across it. Below the beak, or at either side of  the tip, are the feet, each with the claw cross-hatched. What seem to be  the reduced and highly conventionalized wings fill the lower corner of  each side of the figure.    The shield in the center of the Tablet of the Sun at Palenque (Pl. 22,  fig. 6) shows a face in which the motif seems to be the full-face view  of the horned owl. The hooked bill curves over the mouth at each side of  which is the curious scroll seen in the same connection in the figures  of Pl. 21. The ears are somewhat shorter in proportion than usual and  below each, at the sides of the face, is a large ear-plug, similar to  that elsewhere found. The eyes are still further conventionalized with a  decorative scroll surrounding each. Another example of the  conventionalized owl's head is on Stela 1 from Cankuan (Maler, 1908, Pl.  13). We are not yet ready to advance an explanation of the reason why  the owl should occupy such a prominent position in the art of the Mayas.    In only one case is the horned owl found in the Maya manuscripts. In  Tro-Cortesianus 95c (Pl. 22, fig. 2), this owl appears as the head-dress  of a woman in that portion of the codex where baptism and naming are  shown. An owl's head seems to be shown on the end of a warrior's staff  in the bas-relief of the Lower Chamber of the Temple of the Tigers at  Chichen Itza (Pl. 22, fig. 4). Pl. 22, figs. 5, 7, show two owls from  the Aubin manuscript; the first is considered to be the screech owl  (_chiqualli_) and the second the horned owl (_tecolotl_, in Nahuatl).  Pl. 22, figs. 1, 3, show two drawings of owls from Nahua manuscripts.    YUCATAN SCREECH OWL or MOAN BIRD (_Otus choliba thompsoni_). A second  species of owl is represented by the figures on Pl. 23. This has  likewise two feathered tufts or \"ears\" on its head and is always shown  with the head, at least, in profile, but the tufts one in front, the  other at the back of the head. The facial disc is not very prominent the  beak rather long, the tail short, and the plumage somewhat mottled. A  dark ring usually surrounds the eye. It is, with little doubt, the  screech owl, the only other form of eared owl commonly met with in the  Central American region, and in Yucatan is represented by the race above  indicated. This owl, under the name of the Moan bird,[338-*] is always  associated with the idea of death among the Mayas. The familiarity of  this species and its mournful quavering cry uttered at night have no  doubt led to its association with death and mystery as with owls in  other parts of the world.    This Moan bird has an important place in the Maya pantheon, as it is the  representative in many places of god A, the Death god. It appears with a  human body in Dresden 7c (Pl. 23, fig. 1), 10a (Pl. 23, fig. 8), and 11a  (Pl. 23, fig. 3) and in Tro-Cortesianus 66a (Pl. 23, fig. 2). In each of  these places, it occupies the space in which one of the regular gods is  usually found. In Dresden 10a, the day reached in the _tonalamatl_  reckoning is _Cimi_, meaning death, and here, as has been noted, is  found the Moan bird, the symbol of death, with another sign of death in  the circle just above the head of the bird (Pl. 23, fig. 8).    This owl is used as a head-dress itself, but always for women, Dresden  16a (Pl. 23, fig. 19), 18b (Pl. 23, fig. 5), Tro-Cortesianus 94c (Pl.  23, fig. 4), and 95c (Pl. 23, fig. 20). It occurs in both manuscripts in  the pages mentioned several times before, where birth, baptism, and the  naming of children are shown. The curious figure, with a head similar to  Pl. 23, fig. 21, carried on the back of some of the women, is the Moan  sign, referring to the idea of death, possibly to still-birth, as  copulation and birth are shown in this section of the codex (Dresden  18c, 19c). The Moan is found associated with man only once in the  manuscripts. In Tro-Cortesianus 73b (Pl. 23, fig. 18), he is found  perching on a curious frame-like structure in which god B is sitting.    There are several glyphs representing the Moan bird or screech owl; the  first type is easily identifiable, as the head of the bird is clearly  pictured (Pl. 23, figs. 11-14, 16). This head is frequently associated  with the number thirteen (Dresden 8b). It may occur in the line of  glyphs (Dresden 16c), and refer to the Moan pictured below, or it may  occur "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#12)"],[1,"because I should be more  comfortable when I could understand and make myself understood, and  because I supposed that the authorities would hardly teach me the  language if they intended any cruel usage towards me afterwards.  We  began at once, and I learnt the names of everything in the room, and also  the numerals and personal pronouns.  I found to my sorrow that the  resemblance to European things, which I had so frequently observed  hitherto, did not hold good in the matter of language; for I could detect  no analogy whatever between this and any tongue of which I have the  slightest knowledge,--a thing which made me think it possible that I  might be learning Hebrew.    I must detail no longer; from this time my days were spent with a  monotony which would have been tedious but for the society of Yram, the  jailor's daughter, who had taken a great fancy for me and treated me with  the utmost kindness.  The man came every day to teach me the language,  but my real dictionary and grammar were Yram; and I consulted them to  such purpose that I made the most extraordinary progress, being able at  the end of a month to understand a great deal of the conversation which I  overheard between Yram and her father.  My teacher professed himself well  satisfied, and said he should make a favourable report of me to the  authorities.  I then questioned him as to what would probably be done  with me.  He told me that my arrival had caused great excitement  throughout the country, and that I was to be detained a close prisoner  until the receipt of advices from the Government.  My having had a watch,  he said, was the only damaging feature in the case.  And then, in answer  to my asking why this should be so, he gave me a long story of which with  my imperfect knowledge of the language I could make nothing whatever,  except that it was a very heinous offence, almost as bad (at least, so I  thought I understood him) as having typhus fever.  But he said he thought  my light hair would save me.    I was allowed to walk in the garden; there was a high wall so that I  managed to play a sort of hand fives, which prevented my feeling the bad  effects of my confinement, though it was stupid work playing alone.  In  the course of time people from the town and neighbourhood began to pester  the jailor to be allowed to see me, and on receiving handsome fees he let  them do so.  The people were good to me; almost too good, for they were  inclined to make a lion of me, which I hated--at least the women were;  only they had to beware of Yram, who was a young lady of a jealous  temperament, and kept a sharp eye both on me and on my lady visitors.  However, I felt so kindly towards her, and was so entirely dependent upon  her for almost all that made my life a blessing and a comfort to me, that  I took good care not to vex her, and we remained excellent friends.  The  men were far less inquisitive, and would not, I believe, have come near  me of their own accord; but the women made them come as escorts.  I was  delighted with their handsome mien, and pleasant genial manners.    My food was plain, but always varied and wholesome, and the good red wine  was admirable.  I had found a sort of wort in the garden, which I sweated  in heaps and then dried, obtaining thus a substitute for tobacco; so that  what with Yram, the language, visitors, fives in the garden, smoking, and  bed, my time slipped by more rapidly and pleasantly than might have been  expected.  I also made myself a small flute; and being a tolerable  player, amused myself at times with playing snatches from operas, and  airs such as \"O where and oh where,\" and \"Home, sweet home.\"  This was of  great advantage to me, for the people of the country were ignorant of the  diatonic scale and could hardly believe their ears on hearing some of our  most common melodies.  Often, too, they would make me sing; and I could  at any time make Yram's eyes swim with tears by singing \"Wilkins and his  Dinah,\" \"Billy Taylor,\" \"The Ratcatcher's Daughter,\" or as much of them  as I could remember.    I had one or two discussions with them because I never would sing on  Sunday (of which I kept count in my pocket-book), except chants and hymn  tunes; of these I regret to say that I had forgotten the words, so that I  could only sing the tune.  They appeared to have little or no religious  feeling, and to have never so much as heard of the divine institution of  the Sabbath, so they ascribed my observance of it to a fit of sulkiness,  which they remarked as coming over me upon every seventh day.  But they  were very tolerant, and one of them said to me quite kindly that she knew  how impossible it was to help being sulky at times, only she thought I  ought to see some one if it became more serious--a piece of advice which  I then failed to understand, though I pretended to take it quite as a  matter of course.    Once only did Yram treat me in a way that was unkind and unreasonable,--at  least so I thought it at the time.  It happened thus.  I had been playing  fives in the garden and got much heated.  Although the day was cold, for  autumn was now advancing, and Cold Harbour (as the name of the town in  which my prison was should be translated) stood fully 3000 feet above the  sea, I had played without my coat and waistcoat, and took a sharp chill  on resting myself too long in the open air without protection.  The next  day I had a severe cold and felt really poorly.  Being little used even  to the lightest ailments, and thinking that it would be rather nice to be  petted and cossetted by Yram, I certainly did not make myself out to be  any better than I was; in fact, I remember that I made the worst of  things, and took it into my head to consider myself upon the sick list.  When Yram brought me my breakfast I complained somewhat dolefully of my  indisposition, expecting the sympathy and humouring which I should have  received from my mother and sisters at home.  Not a bit of it.  She fired  up in an instant, and asked me what I meant by it, and how I dared to  presume to mention such a thing, especially when I considered in what  place I was.  She had the best mind to tell her father, only that she was  afraid the consequences would be so very serious for me.  Her manner was  so injured and decided, and her anger so evidently unfeigned, that I  forgot my cold upon the spot, begging her by all means to tell her father  if she wished to do so, and telling her that I had no idea of being  shielded by her from anything whatever; presently mollifying, after  having said as many biting things as I could, I asked her what it was  that I had done amiss, and promised amendment as soon as ever I became  aware of it.  She saw that I was really ignorant, and had had no  intention of being rude to her; whereon it came out that illness of any  sort was considered in Erewhon to be highly criminal and immoral; and  that I was liable, even for catching cold, to be had up before the  magistrates and imprisoned for a considerable period--an announcement  which struck me dumb with astonishment.    I followed up the conversation as well as my imperfect knowledge of the  language would allow, and caught a glimmering of her position with regard  to ill-health; but I did not even then fully comprehend it, nor had I as  yet any idea of the other extraordinary perversions of thought which  existed among the Erewhonians, but with which I was soon to become  familiar.  I propose, therefore, to make no mention of what passed  between us on this occasion, save that we were reconciled, and that she  brought me surreptitiously a hot glass of spirits and water before I went  to bed, as also a pile of extra blankets, and that next morning I was  quite well.  I never remember to have lost a cold so rapidly.    This little affair explained much which had hitherto puzzled me.  It  seemed that the two men who were examined before the magistrates on the  day of my arrival in the country, had been given in charge on account of  ill health, and were both condemned to a long term of imprisonment with  hard labour; they were now expiating their offence in this very prison,  and their exercise ground was a yard separated by my fives wall from the  garden in which I walked.  This accounted for the sounds of coughing and  groaning which I had often noticed as coming from the other side of the  wall: it was high, and I had not dared to climb it for fear the jailor  should see me and think that I was trying to escape; but I had often  wondered what sort of people they could be on the other side, and had  resolved on asking the jailor; but I seldom saw him, and Yram and I  generally found other things to talk about.    Another month flew by, during which I made such progress in the language  that I could understand all that was said to me, and express myself with  tolerable fluency.  My instructor professed to be astonished with the  progress I had made; I was careful to attribute it to the pains he had  taken with me and to his admirable method of explaining my difficulties,  so we became excellent friends.    My visitors became more and more frequent.  Among them there were some,  both men and women, who delighted me entirely by their simplicity,  unconsciousness of self, kindly genial manners, and last, but not least,  by their exquisite beauty; there came others less well-bred, but still  comely and agreeable people, while some were snobs pure and simple.    At the end of the third month the jailor and my instructor came together  to visit me and told me that communications had been received from the  Government to the effect that if I had behaved well and seemed generally  reasonable, and if there could be no suspicion at all about my bodily  health and vigour, and if my hair was really light, and my eyes blue and  complexion fresh, I was to be sent up at once to the metropolis in order  that the King and Queen might see me and"]]]
