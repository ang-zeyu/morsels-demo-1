The forest-dwelling  Botokudos of the upper San Francisco River in Brazil are fairer than the  kindred Kayapo tribe, who inhabit the open campos; and the Arawak of the  Purus River forests are lighter than their fellows in the central Matto  Grosso.[57] Sea-faring coast folk, who are constantly exposed to the  sun, especially in the Tropics, show a deeper pigmentation than their  kindred of the wooded interior.[58] The coast Moros of western Mindanao  are darker than the Subanos, their Malay brethren of the back country,  the lightness of whose color can be explained by their forest life.[59]  So the Duallas of the Kamerun coast of Africa are darker than the  Bakwiri inhabiting the forested mountains just behind them, though both  tribes belong to the Bantu group of people.[60] Here light, in  contradistinction to heat, appears the dominant factor in pigmentation.  A recent theory, advanced by von Schmaedel in 1895, rests upon the  chemical power of light. It holds that the black pigment renders the  negro skin insensitive to the luminous or actinic effects of solar  radiation, which are far more destructive to living protoplasm than the  merely calorific effects.[61]    [Sidenote: Pigmentation and altitude]    Coloration responds to other more obscure influences of environment. A  close connection between pigmentation and elevation above sea level has  been established: a high altitude operates like a high latitude.  Blondness increases appreciably on the higher slopes of the Black  Forest, Vosges Mountains, and Swiss Alps, though these isolated  highlands are the stronghold of the brunette Alpine race.[62] Livi, in  his treatise on military anthropometry, deduced a special action of  mountains upon pigmentation on observing a prevailing increase of  blondness in Italy above the four-hundred meter line, a phenomenon which  came out as strongly in Basilicata and Calabria provinces of the south  as in Piedmont and Lombardy in the north.[63] The dark Hamitic Berbers  of northern Africa have developed an unmistakable blond variant in high  valleys of the Atlas range, which in a sub-tropical region rises to the  height of 12,000 feet. Here among the Kabyles the population is fair;  grey, blue or green eyes are frequent, as is also reddish blond or  chestnut hair.[64] Waitz long ago affirmed this tendency of mountaineers  to lighter coloring from his study of primitive peoples.[65] The  modification can not be attributed wholly to climatic contrast between  mountain and plain. Some other factor, like the economic poverty of the  environment and the poor food-supply, as Livi suggests, has had a hand  in the result; but just what it is or how it has operated cannot yet be  defined.[66]    [Sidenote: Difficulty of Generalization]    Enough has been said to show that the geographer can formulate no broad  generalization as to the relation of pigmentation and climate from the  occurrence of the darkest skins in the Tropics; because this fact is  weakened by the appearance also of lighter tints in the hottest  districts, and of darker ones in arctic and temperate regions. The  geographer must investigate the questions when and where deeper shades  develop in the skins of fair races; what is the significance of dark  skins in the cold zones and of fair ones in hot zones. His answer must  be based largely on the conclusions of physiologists and physicists, and  only when these have reached a satisfactory solution of each detail of  the problem can the geographer summarize the influence of environment  upon pigmentation. The rule can therefore safely be laid down that in  all investigation of geographic influences upon the permanent physical  characteristics of races, the geographic distribution of these should be  left out of consideration till the last, since it so easily  misleads.[67] Moreover, owing to the ceaseless movements of mankind,  these effects do not remain confined to the region that produced them,  but pass on with the wandering throng in whom they have once developed,  and in whom they endure or vanish according as they prove beneficial or  deleterious in the new habitat.    [Sidenote: Psychical effects.]    II. More varied and important are the psychical effects of geographic  environment. As direct effects they are doubtless bound up in many  physiological modifications; and as influences of climate, they help  differentiate peoples and races in point of temperament. They are  reflected in man's religion and his literature, in his modes of thought  and figures of speech. Blackstone states that \"in the Isle of Man, to  take away a horse or ox was no felony, but a trespass, because of the  difficulty in that little territory to conceal them or to carry them  off; but to steal a pig or a fowl, which is easily done, was a capital  misdemeanour, and the offender punished with death.\" The judges or  deemsters in this island of fishermen swore to execute the laws as  impartially \"as the herring's backbone doth lie in the middle of the  fish.\"[68] The whole mythology of the Polynesians is an echo of the  encompassing ocean. The cosmography of every primitive people, their  first crude effort in the science of the universe, bears the impress of  their habitat. The Eskimo's hell is a place of darkness, storm and  intense cold;[69] the Jew's is a place of eternal fire. Buddha, born in  the steaming Himalayan piedmont, fighting the lassitude induced by heat  and humidity, pictured his heaven as Nirvana, the cessation of all  activity and individual life.    [Sidenote: Indirect effect upon language]    Intellectual effects of environment may appear in the enrichment of a  language in one direction to a rare nicety of expression; but this may  be combined with a meager vocabulary in all other directions. The  greatest cattle-breeders among the native Africans, such as the Hereros  of western Damaraland and the Dinkas of the upper White Nile, have an  amazing choice of words for all colors describing their animals--brown,  dun, red, white, dapple, and so on in every gradation of shade and hue.  The Samoyedes of northern Russia have eleven or twelve terms to  designate the various grays and browns of their reindeer, despite their  otherwise low cultural development.[70] The speech of nomads has an  abundance of expressions for cattle in every relation of life. It  includes different words for breeding, pregnancy, death, and  slaughtering in relation to every different kind of domestic animal. The  Magyars, among whom pastoral life still survives on the low plains of  the Danube and Theiss, have a generic word for herd, _csorda_, and  special terms for herds of cattle, horses, sheep, and swine.[71] While  the vocabulary of Malays and Polynesians is especially rich in nautical  terms, the Kirghis shepherd tribes who wander over the highlands of  western Asia from the Tian Shan to the Hindu Kush have four different  terms for four kinds of mountain passes. A _daban_ is a difficult, rocky  defile; an _art_ is very high and dangerous; a _bel_ is a low, easy  pass, and a _kutal_ is a broad opening between low hills.[72]    To such influences man is a passive subject, especially in the earlier  stages of his development; but there are more important influences  emanating from his environment which affect him as an active agent,  challenge his will by furnishing the motives for its exercise, give  purpose to his activities, and determine the direction which they shall  take.[73] These mold his mind and character through the media of his  economic and social life, and produce effects none the less important  because they are secondary. About these anthropo-geography can reach  surer conclusions than regarding direct psychical effects, because it  can trace their mode of operation as well as define the result. Direct  psychical effects are more matters of conjecture, whose causation is  asserted rather than proved. They seem to float in the air, detached  from the solid ground under foot, and are therefore subject matter for  the psychologist rather than the geographer.    [Sidenote: The great man in history.]    What of the great man in this geographical interpretation of history? It  seems to take no account of him, or to put him into the melting-pot with  the masses. Both are to some extent true. As a science,  anthropo-geography can deal only with large averages, and these exclude  or minimize the exceptional individual. Moreover, geographic conditions  which give this or that bent to a nation's purposes and determine its  aggregate activities have a similar effect upon the individual; but he  may institute a far-seeing policy, to whose wisdom only gradually is the  people awakened. The acts of the great man are rarely arbitrary or  artificial; he accelerates or retards the normal course of development,  but cannot turn it counter to the channels of natural conditions. As a  rule he is a product of the same forces that made his people. He moves  with them and is followed by them under a common impulse. Daniel Boone,  that picturesque figure leading the van of the westward movement over  the Allegheny Mountains, was born of his frontier environment and found  a multitude of his kind in that region of backwoods farms to follow him  into the wilderness. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, in the Louisiana  Purchase, carried out the policy of expansion adumbrated in Governor  Spottswood's expedition with the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe over  the Blue Ridge in 1712. Jefferson's daring consummation of the purchase  without government authority showed his community of purpose with the  majority of the people. Peter the Great's location of his capital at St.  Petersburg, usually stigmatized as the act of a despot, was made in  response to natural conditions offering access to the Baltic nations,  just as certainly as ten centuries before similar conditions and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15299"],[0,"Drake, Nelson and Napoleon (#12)"],[1,"reports if I separated from her, which I would do      with pleasure the moment we can be united. I want to see her no      more; therefore we must manage till we can quit this country, or      your uncle dies. I love you: I never did love any one else. I      never had a dear pledge of love till you gave me one; and you,      thank my God, never gave one to anybody else. I think before      March is out, you will either see us back, or so victorious that      we shall ensure a glorious issue to our toils. Think what my      Emma will feel at seeing return safe, perhaps with a little      more fame, her own dear Nelson. Never, if I can help it, will I      dine out of my ship or go on shore, except duty calls me. Let      Sir Hyde have any glory he can catch, I envy him not. You, my      beloved Emma, and my country, are the two dearest objects of my      fond heart. _A heart susceptible and true._ Only place      confidence in me, and you shall never be disappointed. I burn      all your dear letters, because it is right for your sake; and I      wish you would burn all mine--they can do no good, and will do      us both harm if any seizure of them; or the dropping even one of      them would fill the mouths of the world sooner than we intend.      My longing for you, both person and conversation, you may      readily imagine (especially the person). No, my heart, person,      and mind are in perfect union of love towards my own dear,      beloved Emma, the real bosom friend of her, all hers, all      Emma's.        NELSON AND BRONTE.    The Prince of Wales had dined with and paid suspicious attentions to  Emma, and her fond lover, knowing this, advised her to warn him off.  He probably had an instinct that his \"beloved Emma,\" who is \"the  dearest object of his fond heart,\" was not quite strong enough to  resist temptation. Especially would she be likely to fall under the  fascinating influence of this little princely scamp. Nelson's mind  turned to his wife, and he emphasized the desire that he might never  see his aversion again. Nor did he.    Some of his contemporaries doubted the paternity of Horatia; Nelson  never did, and it would be hard to find a more beautiful outpouring of  love than that which he unfailingly gave to his little daughter. Every  thought of his soul was divided between her and the audacious flirt of  a mother whom Nelson, always lavish, calls \"his love\"; \"his darling  angel\"; \"his heaven-given wife\"; \"the dearest, only true wife of his  own till death.\" The \"till death\" finish is quite sailorly!    No one will doubt his amazing faculty for love-making and  love-writing, and it must always be a puzzle how he managed to mix it  so successfully with war. His guilty love-making was an occasional  embarrassment to him, and though he was the greatest naval tactician  of his time, his domestic methods were hopelessly clumsy and  transparent. For instance, in pouring out his grievances to his  mistress he refers to himself by the name of Thompson, and to Lady  Nelson as Aunt. Here are a few examples:--\"Thompson desires me to say  he has never wrote his Aunt since he sailed.\" \"In twelve hours we  shall be across the water, and freed from all the nonsense of his  friends, or rather, pretended ones.\" \"His\" means Hamilton, and  \"friends\" means the Prince of Wales, whom he looked upon as a rival  for Emma's accommodating affections. Again, he says, \"If I separated  from her, which I would do with pleasure the moment we can be united.\"  \"Her\" is Lady Nelson, but in discussing delicate matters of domestic  policy he thinks it desirable to conceal that he would not weep were  he to hear of Sir William's death, or be broken with grief to separate  entirely from Lady Nelson, so that he might become \"united to his  heaven-given wife,\" \"our darling angel, Emma.\"      V    The Admiralty did a great injustice to the victor of the Nile by  appointing Sir Hyde Parker commander-in-chief, instead of one who was  known to be the most brilliant officer in the Navy. It must have cut  deeply into Nelson's proud soul to have to serve under a man who had  not a particle of initiative; and, but for the splendid bravery and  matchless talents of his second, the wooden walls of old England would  have been sent to Davy Jones by the forts of Copenhagen and the Danish  fleet. Sir Hyde did not relish having Nelson with him at all. He  sulked, and treated him in a way that was observed and resented by  those who served under him. The commander-in-chief acted like a  jealous maiden, his intention being to freeze and humiliate the man  who was destined to win the victory and save the British fleet from  entire destruction. There always has been tremendous jealousy in the  Navy. But Sir Hyde Parker should have known that he was dealing with  an officer (who was the genius of the Navy) who would stand no  nonsense from any Lord High Admiral or other fussy dignitary whom he  could put in his pocket whenever he liked to exercise his personality.  Nelson never shirked responsibility when his country's interests were  being endangered by a dignified snob. Discipline, so far as he was  concerned until his object was gained, was pushed aside, and the great  spirit swept into the vortex of the danger and extinguished all  opposition. He said on one occasion, \"I hate your pen-and-ink men. A  fleet of British warships are the best negotiators in Europe.\"    I have said that Parker was in the \"sulks,\" so Nelson adopted a  humorous plan of thawing the ice by catching a turbot on the Dogger  Bank on the passage out to the Baltic. A sly seaman had told him that  this kind of fish was easily caught, so when they arrived on the Bank  the fishing commenced, and the turbot was caught. Nelson knew his  commander-in-chief was never averse to eating, so he gave orders to  have it sent to Sir Hyde, and although the sea was dangerous for a  small boat, the fish was in due course presented to Parker, who sent  back a cordial note of thanks. This ingenious stratagem eased the  strained relations between the two men, but there still remained a  feeling on the part of the commander-in-chief that the electric and  resourceful spirit of Nelson would, in any engagement, be the  dominating factor, with or without official sanction. He knew how  irresistibly Nelson's influence permeated the fleet, for no man knew  better than this much-envied Vice-Admiral how to enthuse his comrades  (high and low) in battle, and also what confidence the nation as a  whole had in what he called the \"Nelson touch.\" Sir Hyde Parker,  knowing Nelson's superb qualities, should have paused and considered  the consequences before he slyly sought to put such a man in the  shade. There was not a man in the whole squadron who would not have  gone to his doom under Nelson's lead rather than live under any  other's. Nelson inspired men with the same love of glory which he  craved for himself. No real sailor ever did like to sail under a  hesitating, nervous commander. Parker, at the battle of Copenhagen,  gives one (from all accounts) the impression of unsureness, afraid to  take any risk lest it be the wrong one. Nelson was always sure, and  never hesitated to put into practice his considered views.    Parker, at a critical moment in the battle of Copenhagen, hoisted No.  39, which meant \"Leave off action.\" Nelson shrugged his shoulders, and  Said, \"No, I'm damned if I do,\" and kept his own \"Engage the enemy  more closely\" flying. He then added to Captain Foley, \"I have only one  eye, and have a right to be blind sometimes.\" He then put the  telescope to his blind eye, and said, \"I really do not see the  signal.\" Unfortunately, some of the ships retired, and one able  fellow, Captain Riou, who knew it was a wrong move, was so distressed  that he called out in despair to one of his officers beside him, \"What  will Nelson think of us?\" The poor captain was subsequently killed.  There can be no doubt now that the signal 39 was not permissive or  optional, nor that Nelson, having the enemy by the throat, refused to  let go until he had strangled him, nor that he did dramatically act  the blind-eye trick. He deliberately disobeyed orders, and saved  England's honour and fleet by doing so. It was one of his splendid  performances, and the story of it will live on into distant ages.    Who can calculate the loss of national prestige or the lives that  have been thrown away by putting severely decorous senior officers  over the heads of men who knew their business better and had the  courage and capacity to carry through big naval or military tasks? And  how tempting it must be to many a gallant fellow to take the business  into his own hands! Nelson knew well enough that he had laid himself  open to the full penalty of naval law, but he knew also that if any of  the moth-eaten crew at Whitehall even hinted it there would be \"wigs  on the green.\" No man knew the pulse of the nation better, and no  commander played up to it less. One can imagine hearing him say to  some of his officers (perhaps Captain Hardy of Trafalgar fame), after  he had wrecked the Danish fleet and battered the forts into a  dilapidated condition, \"Well, I have fought contrary to orders, and  they will perhaps hang me; never mind, let them.\" A significant \"let  them\" this, which means more than he cares to express. The Danes  frankly admitted that they had been beaten, and that even their  defence was destroyed, as the Crown batteries could not be held.  Instead of any talk of \"hanging\" him because of his \"disobedience,\" he  was made a Viscount and his Rear-Admiral (Graves) a Knight of the  Bath. These were the only two significant honours conferred. When he  landed at Copenhagen, it is said that the people viewed him with a  mixture of admiration and hostility. He thought they were extremely  amiable. They cheered and shouted \"God bless Lord Nelson!\" There can  be no reason for their doing this, except"]]]
