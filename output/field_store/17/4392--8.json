Her  interest in her whole household and in all those immediately around  her is evident on almost every page. To quote again: \"She is, indeed,  the Mother of her People, taking the deepest interest in all that  concerns them, without respect of persons, from the highest to the  lowest.\"    As a picture of the Royal Court in those days this is exceedingly  valuable, for it shows what an example the Queen and her husband were  setting to the whole nation in the simple life they led in their  Highland home.    That the old people especially loved her can be seen from the  greetings and blessings she received in the cottages she used to  visit. \"May the Lord attend ye with mirth and with joy; may He ever  be with ye in this world, and when ye leave it.\"    [Illustration: Queen Victoria in the Highlands  G. Amato]    The Queen was never weary of the beauties of the Highlands, and quotes  the following lines from a poem by Arthur Hugh Clough to describe  'God's glorious works':                                      The gorgeous bright October,    Then when brackens are changed, and heather blooms are faded,    And amid russet of heather and fern, green trees are bonnie;    Alders are green, and oaks; the rowan scarlet and yellow;    One great glory of broad gold pieces appears the aspen,    And the jewels of gold that were hung in the hair of the birch tree;    Pendulous, here and there, her coronet, necklace, and earrings,    Cover her now, o'er and o'er; she is weary and scatters them from        her.    In the year 1883 the Queen published _More Leaves from the Journal_,  and dedicated it \"To my loyal Highlanders, and especially to the  memory of my devoted personal attendant and faithful friend, John  Brown.\" They are records of her life in Scotland during the years  1862 to 1882.    In the August of 1862 a huge cairn, thirty-five feet high, was erected  to the memory of the Prince Consort. It was set on the summit of Craig  Lowrigan, where it could be seen all down the valley.    A short extract will serve as a specimen of the Queen's style of  writing:    \"At a quarter to twelve I drove off with Louise and Leopold in the  waggonette up to near the 'Bush' (the residence of William Brown,  the farmer) to see them 'juice the sheep.' This is a practice pursued  all over the Highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low  country for the winter. It is done to preserve the wool. Not far from  the burnside, where there are a few hillocks, was a pen in which the  sheep were placed, and then, just outside it, a large sort of trough  filled with liquid tobacco and soap, and into this the sheep were  dipped one after the other; one man took the sheep one by one out  of the pen and turned them on their backs; and then William and he,  holding them by their legs, dipped them well in, after which they  were let into another pen into which this trough opened, and here  they had to remain to dry. To the left, a little lower down, was a  cauldron boiling over a fire and containing the tobacco with water  and soap; this was then emptied into a tub, from which it was  transferred into the trough. A very rosy-faced lassie, with a plaid  over her head, was superintending this part of the work, and helped  to fetch the water from the burn, while children and many collie dogs  were grouped about, and several men and shepherds were helping. It  was a very curious and picturesque sight.\"          CHAPTER X: _The Great Exhibition_      The idea of a \"great exhibition of the Works and Industries of all  Nations\" was Prince Albert's. The scheme when first proposed in 1849  was coldly received in this country. It was intended, to use the  Prince's own words, \"To give us a true test and a living picture of  the point of development at which the whole of mankind has arrived  in this great task, and a new starting-point from which all nations  will be able to direct their further exertions.\"    _The Times_ led the attack against the proposed site in Hyde Park,  and the public was uneasy at the thought of large numbers of  foreigners congregating in London, and at the expected importation  of foreign goods.    As showing the absurd things which 'John Bull' could say at this time  in his jealousy and dislike of foreigners the Prince wrote: \"The  strangers, they give out, are certain to commence a thorough  revolution here, to murder Victoria and myself, and to proclaim the  Red Republic in England; the Plague is certain to ensue from the  confluence of such vast multitudes, and to swallow up those whom  the increased price of everything has not already swept away. For  all this I am to be responsible, and against all this I have to make  efficient provision.\"    _Punch_ pictured the young Prince begging, cap in hand, for  subscriptions:        Pity the sorrows of a poor, young Prince      Whose costly schemes have borne him to your door;      Who's in a fix, the matter not to mince,      Oh! help him out, and Commerce swell your store!    Such constant worry and anxiety affected the Prince's health, but  the support of Sir Robert Peel and of many great firms gradually wore  down the opposition.    The building was designed by Paxton, who had risen from being a  gardener's boy in the Duke of Devonshire's service to the position  of the greatest designer of landscape-gardening in the kingdom.    He took his main ideas for the Crystal Palace from the great  conservatories at Kew and Chatsworth. It was like a huge greenhouse  in shape, nearly one thousand feet long and ninety feet high, with  fountains playing in the naves and a great elm-tree in full leaf under  the roof.    On May 1, 1851, the opening day, everything went well. The crowds  in the streets were immense, and there were some 34,000 visitors  present in the building during the opening ceremony.    Lord Macaulay was much impressed with the Exhibition, for he wrote  after the opening: \"I was struck by the numbers of foreigners in the  streets. All, however, were respectable and decent people. I saw none  of the men of action with whom the Socialists were threatening  us. . . . I should think there must have been near three hundred  thousand people in Hyde Park at once. The sight among the green boughs  was delightful. The boats, and little frigates, darting across the  lake; the flags; the music; the guns;--everything was exhilarating,  and the temper of the multitude the best possible. . . .    \"I made my way into the building; a most gorgeous sight; vast;  graceful; beyond the dreams of the Arabian romances. I cannot think  that the Caesars ever exhibited a more splendid spectacle. I was  quite dazzled, and I felt as I did on entering St Peter's. I wandered  about, and elbowed my way through the crowd which filled the nave,  admiring the general effect, but not attending much to details.\"    And again on the last day he wrote: \"Alas! alas! it was a glorious  sight; and it is associated in my mind with all whom I love most.  I am glad that the building is to be removed. I have no wish to see  the corpse when the life has departed.\"    The Royal Party were received with acclamation all along the route.  \"It was a complete and beautiful triumph,--a glorious and touching  sight, one which I shall ever be proud of for my beloved Albert and  my country,\" wrote the Queen. Six million people visited the Great  Fair during the time it remained open.    In one respect, however, it could scarcely be considered a triumph  for this country. It was still an ugly, and in some respects a vulgar,  age. The invention of machinery had done little or nothing to raise  the level of the public taste for what was appropriate and beautiful  in design. That an article cost a large sum of money to manufacture  and to purchase seemed sufficient to satisfy the untrained mind.    Generally speaking, the taste of the producers was uneducated and  much inferior to that of the French. Most of the designs in carpets,  hangings, pottery, and silks were merely copies, and were often  extremely ugly. England, at this time the first among the Industrial  Nations, had utterly failed to hold her own in the Arts.    Machinery had taken the place of handwork, and with the death of the  latter art and industry had ceased to have any relation. Public taste  in architecture was equally bad. A 'revival' of the art of the Middle  Ages resulted only in a host of poor imitations. \"Thirty or forty  years ago, if you entered a cathedral in France or England, you could  say at once, 'These arches were built in the age of the  Conqueror--that capital belonged to the earlier Henrys.' . . . Now  all this is changed. You enter a cathedral, and admire some iron work  so rude you are sure it must be old, but which your guide informs  you has just been put up by Smith of Coventry. You see . . . some  painted glass so badly drawn and so crudely coloured it must be  old--Jones of Newcastle.\"[9]    [Footnote 9: Fergusson, _History of Modern Styles of Architecture_.]    John Ruskin, who was in many ways the greatest art teacher of his  age, was the first to point out the value and the method of correct  observation of all that is beautiful in nature and in art.    In an address on \"Modern Manufacture and Design,\" delivered to the  working men of Bradford, he declared: \"Without observation and  experience, no design--without peace and pleasurableness in  occupation, no design--and all the lecturings, and teachings, and  prizes and principles of art, in the world are of no use, so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#12)"],[1,"task requiring much  experience, especially as the coloring principles are associated in  different qualities of each class of dyewood with different  proportions of other constituents which often give much trouble to the  unpracticed experimenter. Extracts made from logwood roots are now  largely manufactured and often substituted or mixed with the extracts  of real logwood, and have in some instances been palmed of as logwood  extracts of high quality. The correct determination of such  admixtures, like the fixing of anything like the exact commercial  value of dyewood extracts, requires nothing less than a complete  chemical investigation coupled with numerous dyeing trials in  comparison with standard preparations, and should be left to an  expert.    The presence in dyewood extracts of coloring matters in various stages  of development has hitherto militated against their use in place of  the raw materials by many dyers and printers who are still employing  inherited and antiquated processes in which the whole of the coloring  matter is not rendered available. It is often asserted by these that  even the best of extracts fail to give anything like the results  attained by the use of well-prepared woods, and that, indeed, their  application proves a complete failure. Such failure, however, is  simply due to the want of chemical knowledge on the part of the dyers,  for there is no real difficulty in making any good and pure extract  serve all the purposes for which the woods were used. It is to be  hoped that in this branch of industry, as well as in many others, the  employment of chemists will become more general than at present, and  not be restricted, as is often the case, to young men without  experience and without the trained intellect so essential to success  in chemical investigations. High class chemical skill is of course  available to the manufacturer, but the man of science who brings  matured knowledge and valuable brain work into the business required  social as well as pecuniary recognition, and the sooner and more  fuller this fact is appreciated the better it will be for the  maintenance and progress of our industries.    With regard to the astringent extracts, such as sumac, myrabolam,  divi, valonia, quebracho, oak, etc., it is the aim of the  manufacturer, whenever such extracts are intended for the purposes of  dyeing and printing, to obtain the tannin in a form in which it is  best calculated to fix itself upon the fiber. The case is somewhat  different when the same extracts are required for tanning. For this  purpose it is necessary that the extract shall have considerable  permeating power, and that the tannin contained in it shall readily  yield leather of the desired texture, color, and permanency. Extracts  specially suited for this purpose are by no means always the most  suitable for the dyer, and _vice versa_.    A brief description of the processes by which the astringent extracts  may be tested with particular reference to their fitness for definite  purposes concluded the paper.    With regard to the question as to whether experimental dyeing with  bichromate of potash should be employed as a test even in works where  all the dyeing was done with other mordants, he was decidedly of  opinion that it should always be resorted to as one of the tests,  inasmuch as it was the only simple and expeditious method giving a  fair idea of the actual wood strength and money value of the extract.  The test should, in such cases, be supplemented by dyeing trials with  the mordants used at the works, and, if necessary, also by a chemical  analysis. Printing trials were not necessarily bad tests, since  oxidizing was usually added in these where it was necessary, and any  undeveloped coloring matter would thus be oxidized during the steaming  process: but, as he had stated before, it was essentially necessary in  such cases to have a fair idea of the amount of actual coloring matter  in the extract and to adjust the proportion of mordant accordingly.  Such trials should therefore be preceded by carefully conducted dyeing  trials with bichromate of potash. Mr. Thomson had raised the question  whether it would not be well for the manufacturer to prepare these  extracts in such a manner that they would contain all the coloring  matter in one condition only, in order to insure greater uniformity in  their quality and mode of application. This would, no doubt, be a  desirable step to take if the owners of dye and print works were more  in the habit of availing themselves of the service of competent  chemists experienced in this branch, for then they would be able to  make any extract do its full work irrespective of the state of  development of the coloring matter. Such, however, was not the case,  and it was a very common thing for the consumer of dyewood extracts to  require the manufacturer to prepare them specially for him so as to  suit his own dyeing recipes, or in other words to give exactly the  same shades, weight for weight, by his own method of dyeing as the  article he was in the habit of using. The manufacturer was thus often  compelled to make many different qualities of the same extract to suit  different customers. For the same reason adulterated articles were  often preferred to the pure ones. There was, perhaps, no branch of  industry in which chemical skill of a high order could be applied with  greater advantage than in dyeing, and nowhere was this fact less  recognized. Some of the processes of dyeing were exceedingly wasteful  and stood in much need of improvement. He (Mr. Siebold) knew a large  works in which a ton of logwood extract was used daily for black  dyeing only, and he might safely assert that of this enormous quantity  only a very small proportion would be fixed on the fiber, while by far  the greater proportion was utterly wasted. Such a waste could only be  prevented by a searching investigation of its causes by trained skill.  Mr. Thomson had further alluded to the color obtained with logwood or  logwood extract and wool mordanted with bichromate of potash, and  seemed to be under the impression that the color thus obtained was not  black, but blue. This was undoubtedly the case in dyeing trials  performed as tests, as these were conducted purposely with a very  small proportion of coloring matter in order to admit of a better  comparison of the resulting depth of shades. But with larger  proportions of logwood the color obtained was a fine bluish-black, and  with the addition of a small proportion of fustic or quercitron bark  to the logwood a jet black was readily produced. With regard to Mr.  Watson Smith's observation as to fractional dyeing, he (Mr. Siebold)  did not regard this method as a suitable trial for ascertaining the  strength of an extract, but he admitted it was occasionally very  valuable for detecting an admixture of extracts of other dyewoods,  such as quercitron bark extract in logwood extract. It was also a good  method of ascertaining the speed of dyeing and hence the relative  proportion of fully developed coloring matter of an extract.--_Jour.  Soc. Chem.

LITZKOW.      What I want to show is the manner in which the process has been  tested. My employer, Mr. Bierstadt, has given me permission to show  you some samples, and also his chart containing the spectrum colors:  violet, indigo blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and black. This chart  has been photographed in the orthochromatic and also in the ordinary  way.    There are many ways of producing an orthochromatic effect; one is the  use of a glass tank placed behind or in front of the lens, in which a  coloring matter from either a vegetable or mineral product is placed;  this tank or cell is, however, only for use in the studio, as for  outdoor photography we have a colored glass screen, so as not to be  bothered with carrying colored solution.    The tank is constructed as follows: Procure two pieces of best white  plate glass, about 6 inches square; between these place a piece of  rubber of the same size square, and about 3/8 of an inch thick. In the  center of this rubber cut out a circle about 4 inches diameter, and  from one of the corners to the center of the circle cut out a narrow  strip 1/4 inch wide; this serves as the mouth of the tank. The two  pieces of glass and the rubber are cemented together with rubber  cement; then, to hold it firmly together, two brass flanges are used  as a clamp, with four screws at an equal distance apart; a thin sheet  of rubber is on the glass side of the flanges to prevent direct  contact with the glass, the center remaining clear for the rays of  light to pass through solution and glass.    One of the best orthochromatic effects made through this tank is with  a three-grains-to-the-ounce solution of bichromatic of ammonia or  bichromate of potassium. In this method there is no preparation used  on the plate. A common rapid dry plate is exposed through this  solution; the exposure, however, is about twenty times longer than it  would be if you removed the tank with the yellow solution, or, in  other words, if a dry-plate is exposed one minute without the yellow  solution it would have to be exposed twenty minutes through a  three-grain solution of bichromate of potassium or ammonia. It  produces wonderful results on an oil painting or any highly colored  object.    Another method, and the one best adapted for landscapes, is to bathe  the plate in erythrosine and then expose it through a yellow glass  screen.    As an illustration, suppose we have before us a beautiful landscape.  In the foreground beautiful foliage, in the center a lake, in the  distance hills, with a bluish haze appearing pleasing to the eye, also  a nice sky with light clouds. Now "]]]
