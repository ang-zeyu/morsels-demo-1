The great men  of the East rode, in later times, on \"white asses\" (Judges v. 10); the  Egyptian of Sneferu's age had to trudge to court, or to make calls upon  his friends, by the sole aid of those means of locomotion which nature  had given him.    Women, who in most civilized countries claim to themselves far more  elaboration in dress and variety of ornament than men, were content, in  the Egypt of which we are here speaking, with a costume, and a personal  decoration, scarcely less simple than that of their husbands. The  Egyptian _materfamilias_ of the time wore her hair long, and gathered  into three masses, one behind the head, and the other two in front of  either shoulder. Like her spouse, she had but a single garment--a short  gown or petticoat reaching from just below the breasts to half way down  the calf of the leg, and supported by two broad straps passed over the  two shoulders. She exposed her arms and bosom to sight, and her feet  were bare, like her husband's. Her only ornaments were bracelets.    [Illustration: GROUP OF STATUARY, CONSISTING OF A HUSBAND AND WIFE.]    There was no seclusion of women at any time among the ancient Egyptians.  The figure of the wife on the early monuments constantly accompanies  that of her husband. She is his associate in all his occupations. Her  subordination is indicated by her representation being on an unduly  smaller scale, and by her ordinary position, which is behind the figure  of her \"lord and master.\" In statuary, however, she appears seated with  him on the same seat or chair. There is no appearance of her having been  either a drudge or a plaything. She was regarded as man's true  \"helpmate,\" shared his thoughts, ruled his family, and during their  early years had the charge of his children. Polygamy was unknown in  Egypt during the primitive period; even the kings had then but one wife.  Sneferu's wife was a certain Mertitefs, who bore him a son, Nefer-mat,  and after his death became the wife of his successor. Women were  entombed with as much care, and almost with as much pomp, as men. Their  right to ascend the throne is said to have been asserted by one of the  kings who preceded Sneferu; and from time to time women actually  exercised in Egypt the royal authority.        FOOTNOTES:    [7] R. Stuart Poole, \"Cities of Egypt,\" pp. 24, 25.          IV.    THE PYRAMID BUILDERS.      It is difficult for a European, or an American, who has not visited  Egypt, to realize the conception of a Great Pyramid. The pyramidal form  has gone entirely out of use as an architectural type of monumental  perfection; nay, even as an architectural embellishment. It maintained  an honourable position in architecture from its first discovery to the  time of the Maccabee kings (1 Mac. xiii. 28); but, never having been  adopted by either the Greeks or the Romans, it passed into desuetude in  the Old World with the conquest of the East by the West. In the New  World it was found existent by the early discoverers, and then held a  high place in the regards of the native race which had reached the  furthest towards civilization; but Spanish bigotry looked with horror on  everything that stood connected with an idolatrous religion, and the  pyramids of Mexico were first wantonly injured, and then allowed to fall  into such a state of decay, that their original form is by some  questioned. A visit to the plains of Teotihuacan will not convey to the  mind which is a blank on the subject the true conception of a great  pyramid. It requires a pilgrimage to Ghizeh or Saccarah, or a lively  and _well-instructed_ imagination, to enable a man to call up before his  mind's eye the true form and appearance and impressiveness of such a  structure.    Lord Houghton endeavoured to give expression to the feelings of one who  sees for the first time these wondrous, these incomprehensible creations  in the following lines:          After the fantasies of many a night,          After the deep desires of many a day,        Rejoicing as an ancient Eremite          Upon the desert's edge at last I lay:        Before me rose, in wonderful array,          Those works where man has rivalled Nature most,        Those Pyramids, that fear no more decay          Than waves inflict upon the rockiest coast,      Or winds on mountain-steeps, and like endurance boast.          Fragments the deluge of old Time has left          Behind in its subsidence--long long walls        Of cities of their very names bereft,--          Lone columns, remnants of majestic halls,        Rich traceried chambers, where the night-dew falls,--          All have I seen with feelings due, I trow,        Yet not with such as these memorials          Of the great unremembered, that can show      The mass and shape they wore four thousand years ago.    The Egyptian idea of a pyramid was that of a structure on a square base,  with four inclining sides, each one of which should be an equilateral  triangle, all meeting in a point at the top. The structure might be  solid, and in that case might be either of hewn stone throughout, or  consist of a mass of rubble merely held together by an external casing  of stone; or it might contain chambers and passages, in which case the  employment of rubble was scarcely possible. It has been demonstrated by  actual excavation, that all the _great_ pyramids of Egypt were of the  latter character that they were built for the express purpose of  containing chambers and passages, and of preserving those chambers and  passages intact. They required, therefore, to be, and in most cases are,  of a good construction throughout.    There are from sixty to seventy pyramids in Egypt, chiefly in the  neighbourhood of Memphis. Some of them are nearly perfect, some more or  less in ruins, but most of them still preserving their ancient shape,  when seen from afar. Two of them greatly exceed all the others in their  dimensions, and are appropriately designated as \"the Great Pyramid\" and  \"the Second Pyramid.\" A third in their immediate vicinity is of very  inferior size, and scarcely deserves the pre-eminence which has been  conceded to it by the designation of \"the Third Pyramid.\"    Still, the three seem, all of them, to deserve description, and to  challenge a place in \"the story of Egypt,\" which has never yet been told  without some account of the marvels of each of them. The smallest of the  three was a square of three hundred and fifty-four feet each way, and  had a height of two hundred and eighteen feet. It covered an area of two  acres, three roods, and twenty-one poles, or about that of an ordinary  London square. The cubic contents amounted to above nine million feet of  solid masonry, and are calculated to have weighed 702,460 tons. The  height was not very impressive. Two hundred and twenty feet is an  altitude attained by the towers of many churches, and the \"Pyramid of  the Sun\" at Teotihuacan did not fall much short of it; but the mass was  immense, the masonry was excellent, and the ingenuity shown in the  construction was great. Sunk in the rock from which the pyramid rose,  was a series of sepulchral chambers. One, the largest, almost directly  under the apex of the pyramid, was empty. In another, which had an  arched roof, constructed in the most careful and elaborate way, was  found the sarcophagus of the king, Men-kau-ra, to whom tradition  assigned the building, formed of a single mass of blue-black basalt,  exquisitely polished and beautifully carved, externally eight feet long,  three feet high, and three feet broad, internally six feet by two. In  the sarcophagus was the wooden coffin of the monarch, and on the lid of  the coffin was his name. The chambers were connected by two long  passages with the open air; and another passage had, apparently, been  used for the same purpose before the pyramid attained its ultimate size.  The tomb-chamber, though carved in the rock, had been paved and lined  with slabs of solid stone, which were fastened to the native rock by  iron cramps. The weight of the sarcophagus which it contained, now  unhappily lost, was three tons.    [Illustration: SECTION OF THE THIRD PYRAMID, SHOWING PASSAGES.]    [Illustration: TOMB-CHAMBER OF THE THIRD PYRAMID.]    The \"Second Pyramid,\" which stands to the north-east of the Third, at  the distance of about two hundred and seventy yards, was a square of  seven hundred and seven feet each way, and thus covered an area of  almost eleven acres and a half, or nearly double that of the greatest  building which Rome ever produced--the Coliseum. The sides rose at an  angle of 52 deg. 10'; and the perpendicular height was four hundred and  fifty-four feet, or fifty feet more than that of the spire of  Salisbury Cathedral. The cubic contents are estimated at 71,670,000  feet; and their weight is calculated at 5,309,000 tons. Numbers of this  vast amount convey but little idea of the reality to an ordinary reader,  and require to be made intelligible by comparisons. Suppose, then, a  solidly built stone house, with walls a foot thick, twenty feet of  frontage, and thirty feet of depth from front to back; let the walls be  twenty-four feet high and have a foundation of six feet; throw in  party-walls to one-third the extent of the main walls--and the result  will be a building containing four thousand cubic feet of masonry. Let  there be a town of eighteen thousand such houses, suited to be the abode  of a hundred thousand inhabitants--then pull these houses to pieces, and  pile them up into a heap to a height exceeding that of the spire of the  Cathedral of Vienna, and you will have a rough representation of the  \"Second Pyramid of Ghizeh.\" Or lay down the contents of the structure in  a line a foot in breadth and depth--the line would be above 13,500 miles  long, and would reach more than half-way round the earth at the equator.
