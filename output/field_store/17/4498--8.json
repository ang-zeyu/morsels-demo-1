Neither of my two  Chungking men would re-engage to go further. Yet in Chungking Laokwang  the cook had declared that he was prepared to go with me all the way to  Talifu. But now he feared the loneliness of the road to Chaotong. The  way, he said, was mountainous and little trodden, and robbers would see  the smallness of our party and \"come down and stab us.\" I was then glad  that I had not paid him the retaining fee he had asked in Chungking to  take me to Tali.    I called upon the famous Catholic missionaries, the Provicaire Moutot  and Pere Beraud, saw the more important sights and visited some  newly-arrived missionaries of the American Board of Missions. Four of  the Americans were living together. I called with the Inland missionary  at a time when they were at dinner. We were shown into the drawing-room,  where the most conspicuous ornament was a painted scroll with a well  executed drawing of the poppy in flower, a circumstance which would  confirm the belief of the Chinese who saw it, that the poppy is held in  veneration by foreigners. While we waited we heard the noise of dinner  gradually cease, and then the door opened and one of the single ladies  entered. She was fierce to look at, tall as a grenadier, with a stride  like a camel; she was picking her teeth with a hairpin. She courteously  expressed her regret that she could not invite us to dinner. \"Waal now,\"  she said, looking at us from under her spectacles, \"ahm real sorry I  caan't ask you to have somethin' to eat, but we've just finished, and I  guess there ain't nothin' left.\"    Fourteen American missionaries were lately imported into Suifu in one  shipment. Most of them are from Chicago. One of their earliest efforts  will be to translate into Chinese Mr. Stead's \"If Christ came to  Chicago,\" in order the better to demonstrate to the Chinese the lofty  standard of morality, virtue, probity, and honour attained by the  Christian community that sent them to China to enlighten the poor  benighted heathen in this land of darkness.    Szechuen is a Catholic stronghold. There are nominally one hundred  thousand Catholics in the province, representing the labours of many  French missionaries for a period of rather more than two hundred years.  Actually, however, there are only sixty thousand Chinese in the province  who could be called Catholics. To use the words of the Provicaire, the  Chinese are \"_trop materialistes_\" to become Christian, and, as they are  all \"liars and robbers,\" the faith is not easily propagated amongst  them. Rarely have I met two more charming men than these brave  missionaries. French, they told me, I speak with the \"_vrai accent  parisien_,\" a compliment which I have no doubt is true, though it  conflicts with my experience in Paris, where most of the true Parisians  to whom I spoke in their own language gave me the same look of  intelligence that I observe in the Chinaman when I address him in  English. Pere Moutot has been twenty-three years in China--six years at  the sacred Mount Omi, and seventeen years in Suifu; Pere Beraud has been  twenty-three years in Suifu. They both speak Chinese to perfection, and  have been co-workers with the bishop in the production of a  Mandarin-French dictionary just published at Sicawei; they dress as  Chinese, and live as Chinese in handsome mission premises built in  Chinese style. There is a pretty chapel in the compound with scrolls and  memorial tablets presented by Chinese Catholics, a school for boys  attended by fifty ragamuffins, a nunnery and girls' school, and a fit  residence for the venerable bishop. When showing me the chapel, the  Provicaire told me of the visit of one of Our Lord's Apostles to Suifu.  He seemed to have no doubt himself of the truth of the story. Tradition  says that St. Thomas came to China, and, if further proof were wanting,  there is the black image of Tamo worshipped to this day in many of the  temples of Szechuen. Scholars, however, identify this image and its  marked Hindoo features with that of the Buddhist evangelist Tamo, who is  known to have visited China in the sixth century.    In Suifu there is a branch of the China Inland Mission under an  enthusiastic young missionary, who was formerly a French polisher in  Hereford. He is helped by an amiable wife and by a charming English girl  scarcely out of her teens. The missionary's work has, he tells me, been  \"abundantly blessed,\"--he has baptised six converts in the last three  years. A fine type of man is this missionary, brave and self-reliant,  sympathetic and self-denying, hopeful and self-satisfied. His views as a  missionary are well-defined. I give them in his own words:--\"Those  Chinese who have never heard the Gospel will be judged by the Almighty  as He thinks fit\"--a contention which does not admit of dispute--\"but  those Chinese who have heard the Christian doctrine, and still steel  their hearts against the Holy Ghost, will assuredly go to hell; there is  no help for them, they can believe and they won't; had they believed,  their reward would be eternal; they refuse to believe and their  punishment will be eternal.\" But the destruction that awaits the Chinese  must be pointed out to them with becoming gentleness, in accordance with  the teaching of the Rev. S. F. Woodin, of the American Baptist Mission,  Foochow, who says:--\"There are occasions when we must speak that awful  word 'hell,' but this should always be done in a spirit of earnest  love.\" (_Records_ of the Shanghai Missionary Conference, 1877, p. 91.)  It was a curious study to observe the equanimity with which this  good-natured man contemplates the work he has done in China, when to  obtain six dubious conversions he has on his own confession sent some  thousands of unoffending Chinese _en enfer bouillir eternellement_.    But, if the teaching of this good missionary is unwelcome to the  Chinese, and there are hundreds in China who teach as he does, how  infinitely more distasteful must be the teaching of both the Founder and  the Secretary of the Mission which sent him to China.    \"They are God's lost ones who are in China,\" says Mr. C. L. Morgan,  editor of _The Christian_, \"and God cares for them and yearns over  them.\" (_China's Millions_, 1879, p. 94.) \"The millions of Chinese,\"  (who have never heard the Gospel,) says Mr. B. Broomhall, secretary of  the China Inland Mission, and editor of _China's Millions_, \"where are  they going, what is to be their future? What is to be their condition  beyond the grave? Oh, tremendous question! It is an awful thing to  contemplate--but they perish; that is what God says.\" (\"Evangelisation  of the World,\" p. 70.) \"The heathen are all guilty in God's eyes; as  guilty they perish.\" (_Id._, 101.) \"Do we believe that these millions  are without hope in the next world? We turn the leaves of God's Word in  vain, for there we find no hope; not only that, but positive words to  the contrary. Yes! we believe it.\" (_Id._, p. 199.)    The Rev. Dr. Hudson Taylor, the distinguished Founder of the Mission,  certainly believes it, and has frequently stated his belief in public.  Ancestral worship is the keystone of the religion of the Chinese; \"the  keystone also of China's social fabric.\" And \"the worship springs,\" says  the Rev. W. A. P. Martin, D.D., LL.D., of the Tung Wen College, Peking,  \"from some of the best principles of human nature. The first conception  of a life beyond the grave was, it is thought, suggested by a desire to  commune with deceased parents.\" (\"The Worship of Ancestors--a plea for  toleration.\") But Dr. Hudson Taylor condemned bitterly this plea for  toleration. \"Ancestral worship,\" he said (it was at the Shanghai  Missionary Conference of May, 1890), \"Ancestral worship is idolatry from  beginning to end, the whole of it, and everything connected with it.\"  China's religion is idolatry, the Chinese are universally idolatrous,  and the fate that befalls idolaters is carefully pointed out by Dr.  Taylor:--\"Their part is in the lake of fire.\"    \"These millions of China,\" I quote again from Dr. Taylor, \"These  millions of China\" (who have never heard the Gospel), \"are unsaved. Oh!  my dear friends, may I say one word about that condition? The Bible says  of the heathen, that they are without hope; will you say there is good  hope for them of whom the Word of God says, 'they are without hope,  without God in the world'?\" (Missionary Conference of 1888, _Records_,  i., 176.)    \"There are those who know more about the state of the heathen than did  the Apostle Paul, who wrote under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,  'They that sin without law, perish without law,' nay, there are those  who are not afraid to contradict the revelation of Jesus Christ, which  God gave unto Him to shew unto His servants, in which He solemnly  affirms that 'idolators and all liars, their part shall be in the lake  that burneth with fire and brimstone.' Such being the state of the  unsaved of China, do not their urgent needs claim from us that with  _agonising eagerness_ we should hasten to proclaim everywhere the  message through which alone deliverance can be found?\" (_Ut supra_, ii.,  31.)    Look then at the enormous difficulty which the six hundred and eleven  missionaries, of the China Inland Mission, raise up against themselves,  the majority of whom are presumably in agreement with the teaching of  their director, Dr. Hudson Taylor. They tell the Chinese inquirer that  his unconverted father, who never heard the Gospel, has, like Confucius,  perished eternally. But the chief of all virtues in China is filial  piety; the strongest emotion that can move the heart of a Chinaman is  the supreme desire to follow in the footsteps of his father. Conversion  with him means not only eternal separation from the father who gave him  life, but the \"immediate liberation of his ancestors to a life of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19180"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXIV., No. 12,  March 18, 1871 (#12)"],[1," the stuffing closing up the tube), running through the  mattress in all directions.

Our English cotemporary, _Engineering_, appears to have seriously  exercised itself in the perusal of our good-natured article  on \"English and American Scientific and Mechanical Engineering  Journalism,\" which appeared in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, February  4th; at least, we so judge from the tenor of an article in response  thereto, covering a full page of that journal. The article in question  is a curiosity in literature. It deserves a much wider circulation  than _Engineering_ can give it, and we would gladly transfer it to our  columns, but for its exceeding length--a serious fault generally, not  only with _Engineering's_ articles, but most other technical journals  published in England. It would scarcely do for them to be brief in  their discussions, and above all other things, spice and piquancy  must always be excluded. _Engineering_ evidently labors under the  conviction that the heavier it can make its discussions, the more  profoundly will it be able to impress its readers. Hence, we are  equally astonished and gratified to find a gleam of humor flashing out  from the ordinary sober-sided composition of our learned contemporary.  The article came to us just as we were laboring under an attack of  dyspepsia, and its reading fairly shook our atrabilious _corpus_. We  said to ourselves, \"can it be possible that _Engineering_ is about to  experience the new birth, to undergo regeneration, and a baptism of  fire?\" The article is really worth reading, and we begin to indulge  the hope that at least one English technical is going to try to make  itself not only useful, but readable and interesting. And what is  most perplexingly novel in this new manifestation, is the display of  a considerable amount of egotism, which we had always supposed to be  a sinful and naughty thing in technical journalism. And, as if to  magnify this self-complaisance, it actually alludes to its \"_own  extensive and ever-increasing circulation in America_.\" Now to show  how small a thing can impart comfort to the soul of our cotemporary,  we venture to say that the circulation of _Engineering_ in this  country cannot much exceed three hundred copies per week.    It evidently amazes our English cotemporary that a journal like the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, which, according to its own notions, is chiefly  the work of \"scissors and paste,\" should circulate so widely; and it  even belittles our weekly circulation by several thousand copies,  in order to give point to its very amusing, and, we will also add,  generally just criticism.    The writer in _Engineering_, whoever he may be, appears to be a sort  of literary Rip Van Winkle, just waking out of a long sleep; and  he cannot get the idea through his head that it is possible that a  technical journal can become a vehicle of popular information to  the mass of mankind, instead of being the organ of a small clique of  professional engineers or wealthy manufacturers, such as seems to  hold control of the columns of _Engineering_, and who use it either  to ventilate their own pet schemes and theories, or to advertise, by  illustration and otherwise, in the reading columns, a repetition of  lathes, axle-boxes brakes, cars, and other trade specialities, which  can lay little or no claim to novelty. It is, furthermore, a crying  sin in the estimation of our English critic that American technical  journals do not separate their advertisements from the subject matter;  and he thinks that when Yankee editors learn that trade announcements  are out of place in the body of a journal, they will see how to make  their journals pay by making them higher priced. Now we venture to  say, without intending to give offence, that Yankee editors understand  their business quite as well as do English editors; and it is  presumable, at least, that they know what suits their readers on  this side, much better than do English editors. We venture to  suggest--modestly, of course--that journalism in the two countries  is not the same, and should the editor of _Engineering_ undertake  to transfer his system of intellectual labor to this side of the  Atlantic, he would not be long in making the discovery that those  wandering Bohemian engineers, who, he tells us, are in sorrow and  heaviness over the short-comings of American technical journals, would  turn out after all to be slender props for him to lean upon. We think  it probable, however, that with a little more snap, a journal like  _Engineering_ might possibly attain a circulation, in this country, of  500 or 1000 copies weekly.    Why, American engineers have scarcely yet been able to organize  themselves into an association for mutual advancement in their  profession, much less to give the reading public the benefit of their  experience and labors! This fact alone ought, of itself, to satisfy  _Engineering_ that no such journal could profitably exist in this  country. Whenever our American engineers are ready to support such a  journal, there will be no difficulty in finding a publisher.    _Engineering_, in its casual reference to the various technical  journals of America, omits to name our leading scientific monthly, but  introduces with just commendation a venerable cotemporary, now upwards  of three score years of age. Now, it is no disparagement of this  really modest monthly to say, that perhaps there are not sixty hundred  people in the States who know it, even by name; and so far as the use  of \"scissors and paste\" are made available in our technical journals,  we venture the assertion that the editorial staff expenses of the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN are as great, if not greater, than those of  _Engineering_. The question, however, is not so much one of original  outlay, but which of the two journals gives most for the money. In  this very essential particular, and with no intention to depreciate  the value of _Engineering_, we assert, with becoming modesty, that the  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN occupies a position which _Engineering_ will never  be able to attain.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SHERMAN PROCESS.      When people boast of extraordinary successes in processes the details  of which are kept profoundly hidden from public scrutiny, and when the  evidences of success are presented in the doubtful form of specimens  which the public has no means of tracing directly to the process, the  public is apt to be skeptical, and to express skepticism often in not  very complimentary terms.    For a considerable time, the public has been treated to highly-colored  accounts of a wonderful metallurgic process whereby the best iron and  steel were said to be made, from the very worst materials, almost  in the twinkling of an eye. This process has been called after its  assumed inventor, or discoverer, the \"Sherman Process.\" The details of  the process are still withheld, but we last week gave an extract from  an English contemporary, which throws a little light upon the subject.    The agent relied upon to effect the remarkable transformation claimed,  is iodine, used preferably in the form of iodide of potassium, and  very little of it is said to produce a most marvellous change in the  character of the metal.    A very feeble attempt at explaining the rationale of this effect has  been made, in one or two English journals, which we opine will not  prove very satisfactory to chemists and scientific metallurgists. The  _Engineer_ has published two three-column articles upon the subject,  the first containing very little information, and the second a great  number of unnecessary paragraphs, but which gives the proportion of  the iodide used, in the extremely scientific and accurate formula  expressed in the terms \"a small quantity.\"    Assertions of remarkable success have also been given. Nothing,  however, was said of remarkable failures, of which there have  doubtless been some. A series of continued successes would, we  should think, by this time, have sufficed for the parturition of  this metallurgic process, and the discovery would ere this have been  introduced to the world, had there not been some drawbacks.    We are not prepared to deny _in toto_ that the process is all that is  claimed for it; but the way in which it has been managed is certainly  one not likely to encourage faith in it.    The very name of \"process\" implies a system perfected, and if it be  still so far back in the experimental stage that nothing definite in  the way of results can be relied upon, it is not yet a process. If, in  the use of iodine, in some instances, fine grades of iron or steel are  produced, and in as many other experiments, with the same material,  failures result, it is just as fair to attribute the failures to the  iodine, as the successes. A process worthy the name is one that acts  with approximate uniformity, and when, in its use, results vary  widely from what is usual, the variation may be traced to important  differences in the conditions of"]]]
