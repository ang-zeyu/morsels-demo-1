A similar occurrence took place  at Aston, July 20, 1875; and a third happened at Solihull Lodge Valley,  October 27, 1880, when about 80ft. of an embankment 30-ft. high  collapsed.    ~Canal Reservoir,~ better known as \"The Reservoir,\" near Monument Lane,  a popular place of resort, covers an area of 62A. 1R. 5P., and is  three-quarters of a mile long. Visitors and others fond of boating can  be accommodated here to their heart's content.    ~Cannon.~--The first appearance of these instruments of destruction in  connection with the English army was in the time of Edward III. in his  wars with the Scotch and the French, the first great battle of  historical note in which they were used being that of Cressy, in 1346.  The manufacture of \"small arms,\" as they are called, has been anything  but a small feature in the trade history of our past, but  cannon-founding does not appear to have been much carried on, though a  local newspaper of 1836 mentioned that several 250 and 300-pounder guns  were sent from here in that year for the fortifications on the  Dardanelles.    ~Cannon Hill Park~ covers an area of 57a. 1r. 9p., and was presented to  the town by Miss Ryland, the deed of conveyance bearing date April 18th,  1873. The nearest route to this Park is by way of Pershore Road and  Edgbaston Lane, omnibuses going that way every half-hour.    ~Caps.~--The inventor of percussion caps is not known, but we read of  them as being made here as early as 1816, though they were not  introduced into \"the service\" until 1839. The manufacture of these  articles has several times led to great loss of life among the workers,  notes of which will be found under the head of \"_Explosions_.\" See also  \"_Trades_.\"    ~Carlyle.~--The celebrated philosopher, Thomas Carlyle, resided here for  a short time in 1824; and his notes about Birmingham cannot but be worth  preserving. Writing to his brother John under date Aug. 10, he says:--        \"Birmingham I have now tried for a reasonable time, and I cannot    complain of being tired of it. As a town it is pitiful enough--a mean    congeries of bricks, including one or two large capitalists, some    hundreds of minor ones, and, perhaps, a hundred and twenty thousand    sooty artisans in metals and chemical produce. The streets are    ill-built, ill-paved, always flimsy in their aspect--often poor,    sometimes miserable. Not above one or two of them are paved with    flagstones at the sides; and to walk upon the little egg-shaped,    slippery flints that supply their places is something like a penance.    Yet withal it is interesting for some of the commons or lanes that    spot and intersect the green, woody, undulating environs to view this    city of Tubal Cain. Torrents of thick smoke, with ever and anon a    burst of dingy flame, are issuing from a thousand funnels. 'A thousand    hammers fall by turns.' You hear the clank of innumerable steam    engines, the rumbling of cars and vans, and the hum of men interrupted    by the sharper rattle of some canal boat loading or disloading, or,    perhaps, some fierce explosion when the cannon founders [qy: the    proof-house] are proving their new-made ware. I have seen their    rolling-mills, their polishing of teapots, and buttons and    gun-barrels, and lire-shovels, and swords, and all manner of toys and    tackle. I have looked into their ironworks where 150,000 men are    smelting the metal in a district a few miles to the north: their coal    mines, fit image, of Arvenus; their tubes and vats, as large as    country churches, full of copperas and aqua fortis and oil of vitroil;    and the whole is not without its attractions, as well as repulsions,    of which, when we meet, I will preach to you at large.\"      ~Carr's Lane.~--Originally this is believed to have been known as  \"Goddes Cart Lane,\" and was sufficiently steep to be dangerous, as  evidenced by accidents noted in past history.    ~Carr's Lane Chapel,~ the meeting house of the old Independents, or as  they are now called, the Congregationalists, will be noticed under  \"_Places of Worship_.\"    ~Cartoons.~--If some of our fore-fathers could but glance at the  illustrations or the portait caricatures of local public men and their  doings, now given us almost daily, we fear they would not credit us  moderns with much advancement in the way of political politeness,  however forward we may be in other respects. Many really good cartoons  _have_ appeared, and neither side can be said to hold a monopoly of such  sketchy skilfulness, but one of the best (because most truthful) was the  cartoon issued in October 1868, giving the portrait of a  \"Vote-as-you're-told\" electer, led by the nose by his _Daily Post_.    ~Castle.~--Birmingham Castle is named in an ancient document as being  situated a \"bowshot southwestward of the church,\" but the exact site  thereof has never been traced. It is supposed to have been erected about  the year 1140, and to have been demolished by order of King Stephen, in  1176.    ~Castle Street~ takes its name from the hostlery once so famous among  our coach officers.    ~Catacombs.~--There is a large number of massively-built stone vaults  underneath Christ Church, each divided into tiers of catacombs, or  receptacles for the dead. It is in one of these that the remains of  Baskerville at last found a resting place.--The catacombs at the General  Cemetery are many, being cut out of the sandstone rock known as Key  Hill, and a large number have been and can be excavated underneath the  church in the Warstone Lane Cemetery.    ~Cathedral.~--See \"_Places of Warship--Catholic_.\"    ~Cat Shows.~--The first Cat Show held here was opened November 29th,  1873, and was a very successful speculation; but the exhibitions of the  two following years did not pay and since then the grimalkins have been  left at home.    ~Cattle Show.~--As first started (in 1849, when it was held near Kent  Street), and at Bingley Hall in the following year, this was an annual  show of cattle, sheep, and pigs only, but after years has made it a  gathering place for specimens, of nearly everything required on a farm,  and the \"Show\" has become an \"_Exhibition_,\" under which heading full  notice will be found.    ~Cemeteries.~--The burial grounds attached to the Churches were formerly  the only places of interment save for suicides and murderers--the former  of whom were buried at some cross-road, with a stake driven through the  body, while the latter were frequently hung in chains and got no burial  at all. In 1807 the first addendum to our churchyards was made by the  purchase of 13,192 square yards of land in Park Street, which cost  L1,600. Having been laid out and enclosed with substantial railed walls  at a further outlay of L764, the ground was duly consecrated July 16,  1813, and for some years was the chief receptacle for decaying humanity  of all classes, many thousands of whom were there deposited. By degrees  the ground came to be looked upon as only fit for the poorest of the  poor, until, after being divided by the railway, this \"God's Acre\" was  cared fir by none, and was well called the \"black spot\" of the town.  Since the passing of the Closed Burial Grounds Bill (March 18, 1878) the  Corporations have taken possession, and at considerable expense have  re-walled the enclosure and laid it out as a place of health resort for  the children of the neighbourhood. The burial grounds of St.  Bartholomew's, St. Martin's, St. Mary's, and St. George's have also been  carefully and tastefully improved in appearance, and we can now venture  to look at most of our churchyards without shame.    The General Cemetery at Key Hill was originated at a meeting held Oct.  18, 1832, when a proprietary Company was formed, and a capital fixed at  L12,000, in shares of L10 each. The total area of the property is about  twelve acres, eight of which are laid out for general burials, in a  edition to the catacombs cut into the sandstone rock.    The Church of England Cemetery in Warstone Lane is also the property of  a private Company, having a capital of L20,000 in L10 shares. The area  is nearly fifteen acres, the whole of which was consecrated as a burial  ground for the Church on August 20, 1848.    The Catholic Cemetery of St. Joseph, at Nechell's Green, received its  first consignment in 1850.    The introduction and extension of railways have played sad havoc with a  number of the old burial grounds belonging to our forefathers. As  mentioned above the London and North Western took a slice out of Park  Street Cemetery. The Great Western cleared the Quakers' burial ground in  Monmouth Street (where the Arcade now stands) the remains of the  departed Friends being removed to their chapel yard in Bull Street, and  a curious tale has been told in connection therewith. It is said that  the representative of the Society of Friends was a proper man of  business, as, indeed, most of them are, and that he drove rather a hard  bargain with the railway directors, who at last were obliged to give in  to what they considered to be an exorbitant demand for such a small bit  of freehold. The agreement was made and the contract signed, and Friend  Broadbrim went on his way rejoicing; but not for long. In selling the  land he apparently forgot that the land contained bones, for when the  question of removing the dead was mooted, the Quaker found he had to pay  back a goodly portion of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#12)"],[1,"their parents about clamorous for food, which was plentiful in the Vale  in the shape of numerous small beetles, caterpillars, and very small  snails. The young were mostly hatched by the beginning of July, but I  found one nest with young still in it in a furze-bush about ten yards  from high water-mark as late as the 27th of July, but the young were all  flown when I visited the nest two days afterwards. The Tree Pipits have  all departed by the middle of October, and I have never seen any there  in November.    The Tree Pipit is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, but no letters  marking the distribution of the species amongst the Islands are given.  There is no specimen of this or either of the other Pipits in the  Museum.      56. MEADOW PIPIT. _Anthus pratensis_, Linnaeus. French, \"Le cujelier,\"  \"Pipit des pres,\" \"Pipit Farlouse.\"--The Meadow Pipit is resident and  breeds in all the Islands, but is by no means so numerous as the Tree  Pipit is during the summer. I think, however, its numbers are slightly  increased in the autumn, about the time of the departure of the Tree  Pipits, by migrants.    It is included by Professor Ansted in his list, but marked as occurring  only in Guernsey.      57. ROCK PIPIT. _Anthus obscurus_, Latham. French, \"Pipit obsur,\" \"Pipit  spioncelle.\"--Resident and numerous, breeding amongst the rocks and  round the coast of all the Islands. It is also common in all the small  outlying Islands, such as Burhou, and all the little rocky Islands that  stretch out to the northward of Herm, and are especially the home of the  Puffin and the Lesser Black-backed Gull. On all of these the Rock Pipit  may be found breeding, but its nest is generally so well concealed  amongst the thrift samphire, wild stock, and other seaside plants which  grow rather rankly amongst those rocks, considering how little soil  there generally is for them and what wild storms they are subject to,  that it is by no means easy to find it, though one may almost see the  bird leave the nest.    The Bock Pipit is included in Professor Ansted's list, but marked as  only occurring in Guernsey. All the Rock Pipits I have seen in the  Channel Islands have been the common form, _Anthus obscurus_; I have  never seen one of the rufous-breasted examples which occur in  Scandinavia and the Baltic, and have by some been separated as a  distinct species under the name of _Anthus rupestris_.      58. SKY LARK. _Alauda arvensis_, Linnaeus. French, \"Alouette des  champs.\"--Mr. Metivier, in his 'Dictionary,' gives Houedre as the local  Guernsey-French name of the Sky Lark. As may be supposed by its having a  local name, it is a common and well-known bird, and is resident in all  the Islands. I have not been able to find that its numbers are much  increased by migrants at any time of year, though probably in severe  weather in the winter the Sky Larks flock a good deal, as they do in  England. The Sky Lark breeds in all the Islands, and occasionally places  its nest in such exposed situations that it is wonderful how the young  escape. One nest we found by a roadside near Ronceval; it was within  arm's length of the road, and seemed exposed to every possible danger.  When we found it, on the 15th of June, there were five eggs in it,  fresh, or, at all events, only just sat on, as I took one and blew it  for one of my daughters. On the 19th we again visited the nest; there  were then four young ones in it, but they were so wonderfully like the  dry grass which surrounded the nest in colour that it was more difficult  to find it then than when the eggs were in it, and except for the young  birds moving as they breathed I think we should not have found it a  second time. A few days after--July the 3rd--there was very heavy rain  all night. Next day we thought the Sky Larks must be drowned (had they  been Partridges under the care of a keeper they would have been), but as  it was only one was washed out of the nest and drowned; the rest were  all well and left the nest a few days after. So in spite of the exposed  situation close to a frequented road, on a bit of common ground where  goats and cows were tethered, nets and seaweed, or \"vraic,\" as it is  called in Guernsey, spread for drying, dogs, cats, and children  continually wandering about, and without any shelter from rain, the old  birds brought off three young from their five eggs.    The Sky Lark is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list as occurring only  in Guernsey and Sark. It is, however, quite as common in Alderney and  Herm. There is no specimen in the Museum.      59. SNOW BUNTING. _Plectrophanes nivalis_, Linnaeus. French, \"Ortolan  de neige,\" \"Bruant de neige.\"--The Snow Bunting is probably a regular,  though never very numerous, autumnal visitant, remaining on into the  winter. It seems to be more numerous in some years than others. Mr. Mac  Culloch tells me a good many Snow Buntings were seen in November, 1850.    Mr. Couch records one in the 'Zoologist' for 1874 as having been killed  at Cobo on the 28th of September of that year. This seems rather an  early date. When I was in Guernsey in November, 1875, I saw a few flocks  of Snow Buntings, and one--a young bird of the year--which had been  killed by a boy with a catapult, was brought into Couch's shop about the  same time, and I have one killed at St. Martin's, Guernsey, in November,  1878; and Captain Hubbach writes me word that he shot three out of a  flock of five in Alderney in January, 1863.    Professor Ansted mentions the Snow Bunting in his list as occurring in  Guernsey and Sark, and there is a specimen at present in the Museum.    60. BUNTING. _Emberiza miliaria_, Linnaeus. French, \"Le proyer,\" \"Bruant  proyer.\"--The Bunting is resident in Guernsey and breeds there, but in  very small numbers, and it is very local in its distribution. I have  seen a few in the Vale. I saw two or three about the grounds of the  Vallon in July, 1878, which were probably the parents and their brood  which had been hatched somewhere in the grounds.    It is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list as occurring only in  Guernsey. There is one specimen in the Museum.      61. YELLOW HAMMER. _Emberiza citrinella_, Linnaeus. French, \"Bruant  jaune.\"--The Yellow Hammer, though resident and breeding in all the  Islands, is by no means as common as in many parts of England. In  Alderney perhaps it is rather more common than in Guernsey, as I saw  some near the Artillery Barracks this summer, 1878, and Captain Hubbach  told me he had seen two or three pairs about there all the year. In  Guernsey, on the other hand, I did not see one this summer, 1878. I  have, however, shot a young bird there which certainly could not have  been long out of the nest. I have never seen the Cirl Bunting in any of  the Islands, nor has it, as far as I know, been recorded from them,  which seems rather surprising, as it is common on the South Coast of  Devon, and migratory, but not numerous, on the North Coast of  France;[12] so it is very probable that it may yet occur.    The Yellow Hammer is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are also a pair in the Museum.      62. CHAFFINCH. _Fringilla caelebs_, Linnaeus. French, \"Pinson  ordinaire,\" \"Grosbec pinson.\"--- The Chaffinch is resident, tolerably  common, and generally distributed throughout the Islands, but is nowhere  so common as in England. In Guernsey this year, 1878, it seemed to me  rather to have decreased in numbers, as I saw very few,--certainly not  so many as in former years,--though I could not find that there was any  reason for the decrease.    It is, of course, mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, but by him only  marked as occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is only one--a  female--at present in the Museum.      63. BRAMBLING. _Fringilla montifringilla_, Linnaeus. French, \"Pinson  d'Ardennes.\" \"Grosbec d'Ardennes.\"--The Brambling can only be considered  an occasional autumn and winter visitant, and probably never very  numerous. I have never seen the bird in the Channel Islands myself. I  have, however, one specimen--a female--killed in Brock Road, Guernsey,  in December, 1878, and I have been informed by Mr. MacCulloch that he  had a note of the occurrence of the Brambling or Mountain Finch in  January, 1855. It cannot, however, be looked upon as anything more than  a very rare occasional straggler, by no means occurring every year.    It is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as occurring in  Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen at present in the Museum.      64. TREE SPARROW. _Passer montanus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Friquet.\"--The  Tree Sparrow breeds, and is probably resident in the Islands. Up to this  year, 1878, I have only seen it once myself, and that was on the 7th of  June, 1876, just outside the grounds of the Vallon in Guernsey. From the  date and from the behaviour of the bird I have no doubt it had a nest  just inside the grounds. I could not then, however, make any great  search for the nest without trespassing, though I got sufficiently near  the bird to be certain of its identity. This year, 1878, I could not see  one anywhere about the Vallon, either inside or outside the grounds. I  saw, however, one or two about the Vale, but they were very scarce. I  have not myself seen the Tree Sparrow in any of the other Islands.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as occurring in  Sark only. I have not seen a specimen at Mr. Couch's, or any of the  other bird-stuffers, but there is one in the Museum and some eggs, all  of which are probably Guernsey.      65. HOUSE SPARROW. _Passer domesticus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Moineau  domestique,\" \"Grosbec moineau.\"--The House Sparrow is very numerous  throughout the Islands, abounding where there are any buildings  inhabited by either man, horses, or cattle. In the gardens near the town  of St. Peter's Port, in Guernsey, it is very common,"]]]
