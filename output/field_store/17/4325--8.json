Still another  agricultural change is to increase the crops of beans, peas, and  lentils--vegetables which contain when dried as much nutrition as meat.  Germany will need to increase its home production of these crops to  replace the 300,000 tons of them hitherto imported.    Such are the principal points covered by these experts. Their conclusion  is that, if their recommendations be carried out fully, and various  economies be practiced--they could not be touched on in the limits of  this article--Germany can manage to feed its people. But they insist, in  their earnest, concluding words, that this can only be done by carrying  out thoroughly all the methods of producing and saving food products  advised by them. It is a serious problem, indeed, but one which, all  Germany is convinced, can and will be solved.          HOCH DER KAISER    BY GEORGE DAVIES          _HOCH DER KAISER! Amen! Amen!      We of the pulpit and bar,      We of the engine and car;      Hail to the Caesar who's given us men,      Our rightful heritage back again._        Who kicks the dancing shoes from our feet;      Snatches our mouths from the hot forced meat;      Drags us away from our warm padded stalls;      From our ivory keys, our song books and balls;      Orders man's hands from the children's go-carts;      Closes our fool schools of \"ethics\" and \"arts.\"      Puts our ten fingers on triggers and swords,      Marshals us into War's legions by hordes.        _Hoch der Kaiser! Amen! Amen!      We of the sea and the land;      We of the clerking band;      Hail to the Caesar who's given us men      Our rightful heritage back again._        _WHO SUMMONS:_        These women who write of loves that are loose,      (Those little perversionist scribes of the Deuce!)      Laughter of lies lilting lewd at their lips,      Their souls and brains both in a maudlin eclipse;      Their bosoms as bare as their stories and songs;      These coaxers of dogs with their \"rights\" and their wrongs.        _WHO COMMANDS:_        Strike from their shoulders the transparent mesh;      Mark the Red Cross on the cloth for their flesh.        _WHO ORDAINS:_        Ye, men who seem women in work and at play;      Ye, who do blindly as women may say;      Ye, who kill life in the smug cabarets;      Ye, all, at the beck of the little tea-tray;      Ye, all, of the measure of daughters of clay.        Waken to face me: be women no more;      But fellow-men born, from top branch to the core;      Men who must fight--who can kill, who can die,      While women once more shall be covered and shy.        _Hoch der Kaiser!

Instructions for building such a boat are given in detail, and  it has been conjectured that Cornelius van Drebbel, a Dutch physician,  used this information for the construction of the vessel with which in  the early part of the seventeenth century he carried out some  experiments on the Thames. It is doubtful, however, whether van  Drebbel's boat was ever entirely submerged, and the voyage with which he  was credited, from Westminster to Greenwich, is supposed to have been  made in an awash condition, with the head of the inventor above the  surface. More than one writer at the time referred to van Drebbel's boat  and endeavored to explain the apparatus by which his rowers were enabled  to breathe under water.    Van Drebbel died in 1634, and no illustration of his boat has been  discovered. Nineteen years later the vessel illustrated here was  constructed at Rotterdam from the designs of a Frenchman named de Son.  This is supposed to be the earliest illustration of any submarine, and  the inscription under the drawing, which was printed at Amsterdam in the  Calverstraat, (in the Three Crabs,) is in old Dutch, of which the  following is a translation:         The inventor of this ship will undertake to destroy in a       single day a hundred vessels, and such destruction could not       be prevented by fire, storm, bad weather, or the force of the       waves, saving only that the Almighty should otherwise will it.    [Illustration: The figures on the drawing refer to the following  explanations:    1. The beam wherewith power shall be given to the ship.    2. The rudder of the ship, somewhat aft.    3. The keel plate.    4. The two ends of the ship, iron plated.    5. Iron bolts and screws.    6. How deep the ship goes into the water when awash.    7. The pivots on which the paddle-wheel turns.    8. Air holes.    9. Gallery along which men can move.    The inset is a drawing of the paddle-wheels which fill the centre  portion of the boat and which work upon the pivot marked 7.]         Vain would it be for ships lying in harbor to be regarded as       safe, for the inventor could reach anywhere unless prevented       by betrayal. None but he could control the craft. Therefore it       may truly be called the lightning of the sea.         Its power shall be proven by a trip to the East Indies in six       weeks or to France and back in a day, for as fast as a bird       flieth can one travel in this boat.    This boat was 72 feet in length, and her greatest height was 12 feet,  while the greatest breadth was 8 feet, tapering off to points at the  end. Capt. Murray Sueter in his book on submarines gives these and other  particulars of the vessel. At either end the boat had a cabin, the air  in which remained good for about three hours, and in the middle of the  boat was a large paddlewheel rotated by clockwork mechanism, which, it  was claimed, would run for eight hours when once wound up. The iron tips  at the ends of the vessel were intended for ramming, and the inventor  was confident he could sink the biggest English ship afloat by crushing  in her hull under water. The boat was duly launched, but on trial of the  machinery being made the paddlewheel, though it revolved in air, would  not move in the water, the machinery being not powerful enough. This,  says Capt. Sueter, was apparently the only reason for de Son's failure,  for his principles were distinctly sound, and he was certainly the first  inventor of the mechanically propelled semi-submarine boat. After her  failure de Son exhibited her for a trifle to any casual passer-by.          THE TORPEDO.    By Katharine Drayton Mayrant Simons, Jr.      Death, our mother, gave us her three gray gifts from the sea--    (Cherish your birthright, Brothers!)--speed, cunning, and certainty.  And mailed Mars, he blest us--but his blessing was most to me!    For the swift gun sometimes falters, sparing the foe afar,    And the hid mine wastes destruction on the drag's decoying spar,  But I am the wrath of the Furies' path--of the war god's avatar!    Mine is the brain of thinking steel man made to match his own,   To guard and guide the death disks packed in the war head's hammered cone,  To drive the cask of the thin air flask as the gyroscope has shown.    My brother, the gun, shrieks o'er the sea his curse from the covered deck,   My brother, the mine, lies sullen-dumb, agape for the dreadnought's wreck,  I glide on the breath of my mother, Death, and my goal is my only check!    More strong than the strength of armored ships is the firing pin's frail      spark,    More sure than the helm of the mighty fleet are my rudders to their mark,  The faint foam fades from the bright screw blades--and I strike from the      under dark!    Death, our mother, gave us her three gray gifts from the sea--    (Cherish your birthright, Brothers!)--speed, cunning, and certainty.  And mailed Mars, he blest us--but his blessing was most to me!          \"God Punish England, Brother\"    A New Hymn of Germany's Gospel of Hatred    [From Public Opinion, London, Feb. 5, 1915.]      The amazing outburst of hatred against England in Germany is responsible  for a new form of greeting which has displaced the conventional formulas  of salutation and farewell: \"God punish England!\" (\"Gott strafe  England!\") is the form of address, to which the reply is: \"May God  punish her!\" (\"Gott moeg'es strafen!\")    \"This extraordinary formula,\" says The Mail, \"which is now being used  all over Germany, is celebrated in a set of verses by Herr Hochstetter  in a recent number of the well-known German weekly, Lustige Blaetter. In  its way this poem is as remarkable as Herr Ernst Lissauer's famous 'Hymn  of Hate.'\"    Among the prayers at Bruges Cathedral on the Kaiser's birthday was this  German chant of hate, \"God Punish England!\"    A HYMN OF HATE.    Translated by    G. VALENTINE WILLIAMS.        This is the German greeting      When men their fellows meet,      The merchants in the market-place,      The beggars in the street.      A pledge of bitter enmity,      Thus runs the winged word:      \"God punish England, brother!--      Yea! Punish her, O Lord!\"        With raucous voice, brass-throated,      Our German shells shall bear      This curse that is our greeting      To the \"cousin\" in his lair.      This be our German battle cry,      The motto on our sword:      \"God punish England, brother!--Yea!      Punish her, O Lord!\"        By shell from sea, by bomb from air,      Our greeting shall be sped,      Making each English homestead      A mansion of the dead.      And even Grey will tremble      As falls each iron word:      \"God punish England, brother!--      Yea! Punish her, O Lord!\"        This is the German greeting      When men their fellows meet,      The merchants in the market-place,      The beggars in the street.      A pledge of bitter enmity,      Thus runs the winged word:   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#12)"],[1,"line on April 15, 1915.]    On Oct. 28, Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria declared in an army order that  his troops \"had just been fighting under very difficult conditions,\"  and he added: \"It is our business now not to let the struggle with our  most detested enemy drag on longer.... The decisive blow is still to be  struck.\" On Oct. 30, General von Deimling, commanding the Fifteenth Army  Corps (belonging to General von Fabeck's command,) issued an order  declaring that \"the thrust against Ypres will be of decisive  importance.\" It should be noted also that the Emperor proceeded in  person to Thielt and Courtrai to exalt by his presence the ardor of his  troops. Finally, at the close of October, the entire German press  incessantly proclaimed the importance of the \"Battle of Calais.\" It is  superfluous to add that events in Poland explain in a large measure the  passionate resolve of the German General Staff to obtain a decision in  the Western theatre of operations at all costs. This decision would be  obtained if our left were pierced or driven in. To reach Calais, that  is, to break our left; to carry Ypres, that is, to cut it in half;  through both points to menace the communications and supplies of the  British expeditionary corps, perhaps even to threaten Britain in her  island--such was the German plan in the Battle of Flanders. It was a  plan that could not be executed.      CHECK OF GERMAN ATTACK.    The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable quantity of heavy  artillery, directed his efforts at first upon the coast and the country  to the north of Dixmude. His objective was manifestly the capture of  Dunkirk, then of Calais and Boulogne, and this objective he pursued  until Nov. 1.    On Oct. 23 the Belgians along the railway line from Nieuport to Dixmude  were strengthened by a French division. Dixmude was occupied by our  marines (fusiliers marins). During the subsequent day our forces along  the railway developed a significant resistance against an enemy superior  in number and backed by heavy artillery. On the 29th the inundations  effected between the canal and the railway line spread along our front.  On the 30th we recaptured Ramscapelle, the only point on the railway  which Belgians had lost. On the 1st and 2d of November the enemy  bombarded Furnes, but began to show signs of weariness. On the 2d he  evacuated the ground between the Yser and the railway, abandoning  cannon, dead and wounded. On the 3d our troops were able to re-enter the  Dixmude district. The success achieved by the enemy at Dixmude at this  juncture was without fruit. They succeeded in taking the town. They  could not debouch from it. The coastal attack had thus proved a total  failure. Since then it has never been renewed. The Battle of Calais, so  noisily announced by the German press, amounted to a decided reverse for  the Germans.      GERMAN DEFEAT AT YPRES.    The enemy had now begun an attack more important than its predecessor,  in view of the numbers engaged in it. This attack was intended as a  renewal to the south of the effort which had just been shattered in the  north. Instead of turning our flank on the coast, it was now sought to  drive in the right of our northern army under the shock of powerful  masses. This was the Battle of Ypres.    In order to understand this long, desperate, and furious battle, we must  hark back a few days in point of time. At the moment when our cavalry  reached Roulers and Cortemark (Oct. 28) our territorial divisions from  Dunkirk, under General Biden, had occupied and organized a defensive  position at Ypres. It was a point d'appui, enabling us to prepare and  maintain our connections with the Belgian Army. From Oct. 23 two British  and French army corps were in occupation of this position, which was to  be the base of their forward march in the direction of Roulers-Menin.  The delays already explained and the strength of the forces brought up  by the enemy soon brought to a standstill our progress along the line  Poelcapelle, Paschendaele, Zandvorde, and Gheluvelt. But in spite of the  stoppage here, Ypres was solidly covered, and the connections of all the  allied forces were established. Against the line thus formed the German  attack was hurled from Oct. 25 to Nov. 13, to the north, the east, and  the south of Ypres. From Oct. 26 on the attacks were renewed daily with  extraordinary violence, obliging us to employ our reinforcements at the  most threatened points as soon as they came up. Thus, on Oct. 31, we  were obliged to send supports to the British cavalry, then to the two  British corps between which the cavalry formed the connecting link, and  finally to intercalate between these two corps a force equivalent to two  army corps. Between Oct. 30 and Nov. 6 Ypres was several times in  danger. The British lost Zandvorde, Gheluvelt, Messines, and Wytschaete.  The front of the Allies, thus contracted, was all the more difficult to  defend; but defended it was without a recoil.      REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE.    The arrival of three French divisions in our line enabled us to resume  from the 4th to the 8th a vigorous offensive. On the 10th and 11th this  offensive, brought up against fresh and sharper German attacks, was  checked. Before it could be renewed the arrival of fresh reinforcements  had to be awaited, which were dispatched to the north on Nov. 12. By the  14th our troops had again begun to progress, barring the road to Ypres  against the German attacks, and inflicting on the enemy, who advanced in  massed formation, losses which were especially terrible in consequence  of the fact that the French and British artillery had crowded nearly 300  guns on to these few kilometers of front.    Thus the main mass of the Germans sustained the same defeat as the  detachments operating further to the north along the coast. The support  which, according to the idea of the German General Staff, the attack on  Ypres was to render to the coastal attack, was as futile as that attack  itself had been.    During the second half of November the enemy, exhausted and having lost  in the Battle of Ypres alone more than 150,000 men, did not attempt to  renew his effort, but confined himself to an intermittent cannonade.  We, on the contrary, achieved appreciable progress to the north and  south of Ypres, and insured definitely by a powerful defensive  organization of the position the inviolability of our front.    [The compiler of the report here adds a footnote saying that the bodies  of more than 40,000 Germans were found on the battlefield during these  three weeks of battle. The report next proceeds to summarize the  character and results of the operations since the Battle of  Flanders--that is, during the period Nov. 30-Feb. 1.]    Since the former date the French supreme command had not thought it  advisable to embark upon important offensive operations. It has confined  itself to local attacks, the main object of which was to hold in front  of us as large a number of German corps as possible, and thus to hinder  the withdrawal of the troops which to our knowledge the German General  Staff was anxious to dispatch to Russia.      FEW SENT TO THE EAST.    As a matter of fact, the numbers transported to the eastern front have  been very moderate. Of the fifty-two army corps which faced us on the  western front, Germany has only been able to take four and one-half  corps for the eastern front. On the other hand, climatic conditions--the  rain, mud, and mist--were such as to diminish the effectiveness of  offensive operations and to add to the costliness of any undertaken,  which was another reason for postponing them. Still another reason lies  in the fact that from now on the allied forces can count upon a steadily  expanding growth, equally in point of numbers and units as of material,  while the German forces have attained the maximum of their power, and  can only diminish now both in numbers and in value. These conditions  explain the character of the siege warfare which the operations have  assumed during the period under review.    [Illustration: Map illustrating the Battle of Flanders, the Battle of  Ypres, and the terrain of the frustrated German efforts to reach Dunkirk  and Calais.]    Meanwhile, it is by no means the case that the siege warfare has had the  same results for the Germans as for us. From Nov. 15 to Feb. 1, our  opponents, in spite of very numerous attacks, did not succeed in taking  anything from us, except a few hundred metres of ground to the north of  Soissons. We, on the contrary, have obtained numerous and appreciable  results.    [The French writer here proceeds to strike a balance of gains and losses  between the allied and the German forces in France during the Winter  campaign. The result he sums up as follows:]    1. A general progress of our troops; very marked at certain points.    2. A general falling back of the enemy, except to the northeast of  Soissons.    To complete the balance it must be added that:    1. The German offensive in Poland was checked a month ago.    2. The Russian offensive continues in Galicia and the Carpathians.    3. A large part of the Turkish Caucasian army has been annihilated.    4. Germany has exhausted her resources of officers, (there are now on an  average twelve officers to a regiment,) and henceforth will only be able  to develop her resources in men to the detriment of the existing units.    5. The allied armies, on the contrary, possess the power of reinforcing  themselves in a very considerable degree.    It may, therefore, be declared that in order to obtain complete success  it is sufficient for France and her allies to know how to wait and to  prepare victory with indefatigable patience.    The German offensive is broken.    The German defensive will be broken in its turn.
