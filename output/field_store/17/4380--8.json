And the knowledge, this time, brought into his heart a strange little  wayward emotion that was hard to account for--a feeling of unexplained  uneasiness and disquieting joy. For behind it, woven through it rather,  ran a faint exhilaration that connected remotely somewhere with that  touch of delicious alarm, that tiny anticipating \"dread,\" that so  puzzled him when he thought of his next meeting with his skating  companion of the night. It lay beyond all words, all telling, this queer  relationship between the two; but somehow the girl and snow ran in a  pair across his mind.    Perhaps for imaginative writing-men, more than for other workers, the  smallest change of mood betrays itself at once. His work at any rate  revealed this slight shifting of emotional values in his soul. Not that  his writing suffered, but that it altered, subtly as those changes of  sky or sea or landscape that come with the passing of afternoon into  evening--imperceptibly. A subconscious excitement sought to push  outwards and express itself ... and, knowing the uneven effect such  moods produced in his work, he laid his pen aside and took instead to  reading that he had to do.    Meanwhile the brilliance passed from the sunshine, the sky grew slowly  overcast; by dusk the mountain tops came singularly close and sharp; the  distant valley rose into absurdly near perspective. The moisture  increased, rapidly approaching saturation point, when it must fall in  snow. Hibbert watched and waited.    And in the morning the world lay smothered beneath its fresh white  carpet. It snowed heavily till noon, thickly, incessantly, chokingly, a  foot or more; then the sky cleared, the sun came out in splendour, the  wind shifted back to the east, and frost came down upon the mountains  with its keenest and most biting tooth. The drop in the temperature was  tremendous, but the ski-ers were jubilant. Next day the \"running\" would  be fast and perfect. Already the mass was settling, and the surface  freezing into those moss-like, powdery crystals that make the ski run  almost of their own accord with the faint \"sishing\" as of a bird's wings  through the air.          IV      That night there was excitement in the little hotel-world, first because  there was a _bal costume_, but chiefly because the new snow had come.  And Hibbert went--felt drawn to go; he did not go in costume, but he  wanted to talk about the slopes and ski-ing with the other men, and at  the same time....    Ah, there was the truth, the deeper necessity that called. For the  singular connection between the stranger and the snow again betrayed  itself, utterly beyond explanation as before, but vital and insistent.  Some hidden instinct in his pagan soul--heaven knows how he phrased it  even to himself, if he phrased it at all--whispered that with the snow  the girl would be somewhere about, would emerge from her hiding place,  would even look for him.    Absolutely unwarranted it was. He laughed while he stood before the  little glass and trimmed his moustache, tried to make his black tie sit  straight, and shook down his dinner jacket so that it should lie upon  the shoulders without a crease. His brown eyes were very bright. \"I  look younger than I usually do,\" he thought. It was unusual, even  significant, in a man who had no vanity about his appearance and  certainly never questioned his age or tried to look younger than he was.  Affairs of the heart, with one tumultuous exception that left no fuel  for lesser subsequent fires, had never troubled him. The forces of his  soul and mind not called upon for \"work\" and obvious duties, all went to  Nature. The desolate, wild places of the earth were what he loved;  night, and the beauty of the stars and snow. And this evening he felt  their claims upon him mightily stirring. A rising wildness caught his  blood, quickened his pulse, woke longing and passion too. But chiefly  snow. The snow whirred softly through his thoughts like white, seductive  dreams.... For the snow had come; and She, it seemed, had somehow come  with it--into his mind.    And yet he stood before that twisted mirror and pulled his tie and coat  askew a dozen times, as though it mattered. \"What in the world is up  with me?\" he thought. Then, laughing a little, he turned before leaving  the room to put his private papers in order. The green morocco desk that  held them he took down from the shelf and laid upon the table. Tied to  the lid was the visiting card with his brother's London address \"in case  of accident.\" On the way down to the hotel he wondered why he had done  this, for though imaginative, he was not the kind of man who dealt in  presentiments. Moods with him were strong, but ever held in leash.    \"It's almost like a warning,\" he thought, smiling. He drew his thick  coat tightly round the throat as the freezing air bit at him. \"Those  warnings one reads of in stories sometimes ...!\"    A delicious happiness was in his blood. Over the edge of the hills  across the valley rose the moon. He saw her silver sheet the world of  snow. Snow covered all. It smothered sound and distance. It smothered  houses, streets, and human beings. It smothered--life.          V      In the hall there was light and bustle; people were already arriving  from the other hotels and chalets, their costumes hidden beneath many  wraps. Groups of men in evening dress stood about smoking, talking  \"snow\" and \"ski-ing.\" The band was tuning up. The claims of the  hotel-world clashed about him faintly as of old. At the big glass  windows of the verandah, peasants stopped a moment on their way home  from the _cafe_ to peer. Hibbert thought laughingly of that conflict he  used to imagine. He laughed because it suddenly seemed so unreal. He  belonged so utterly to Nature and the mountains, and especially to those  desolate slopes where now the snow lay thick and fresh and sweet, that  there was no question of a conflict at all. The power of the newly  fallen snow had caught him, proving it without effort. Out there, upon  those lonely reaches of the moonlit ridges, the snow lay ready--masses  and masses of it--cool, soft, inviting. He longed for it. It awaited  him. He thought of the intoxicating delight of ski-ing in the  moonlight....    Thus, somehow, in vivid flashing vision, he thought of it while he stood  there smoking with the other men and talking all the \"shop\" of ski-ing.    And, ever mysteriously blended with this power of the snow, poured also  through his inner being the power of the girl. He could not disabuse his  mind of the insinuating presence of the two together. He remembered that  queer skating-impulse of ten days ago, the impulse that had let her in.  That any mind, even an imaginative one, could pass beneath the sway of  such a fancy was strange enough; and Hibbert, while fully aware of the  disorder, yet found a curious joy in yielding to it. This insubordinate  centre that drew him towards old pagan beliefs had assumed command. With  a kind of sensuous pleasure he let himself be conquered.    And snow that night seemed in everybody's thoughts. The dancing couples  talked of it; the hotel proprietors congratulated one another; it meant  good sport and satisfied their guests; every one was planning trips and  expeditions, talking of slopes and telemarks, of flying speed and  distance, of drifts and crust and frost. Vitality and enthusiasm pulsed  in the very air; all were alert and active, positive, radiating currents  of creative life even into the stuffy atmosphere of that crowded  ball-room. And the snow had caused it, the snow had brought it; all this  discharge of eager sparkling energy was due primarily to the--Snow.    But in the mind of Hibbert, by some swift alchemy of his pagan  yearnings, this energy became transmuted. It rarefied itself, gleaming  in white and crystal currents of passionate anticipation, which he  transferred, as by a species of electrical imagination, into the  personality of the girl--the Girl of the Snow. She somewhere was waiting  for him, expecting him, calling to him softly from those leagues of  moonlit mountain. He remembered the touch of that cool, dry hand; the  soft and icy breath against his cheek; the hush and softness of her  presence in the way she came and the way she had gone again--like a  flurry of snow the wind sent gliding up the slopes. She, like himself,  belonged out there. He fancied that he heard her little windy voice come  sifting to him through the snowy branches of the trees, calling his name  ... that haunting little voice that dived straight to the centre of his  life as once, long years ago, two other voices used to do....    But nowhere among the costumed dancers did he see her slender figure. He  danced with one and all, distrait and absent, a stupid partner as each  girl discovered, his eyes ever turning towards the door and windows,  hoping to catch the luring face, the vision that did not come ... and at  length, hoping even against hope. For the ball-room thinned; groups left  one by one, going home to their hotels and chalets; the band tired  obviously; people sat drinking lemon-squashes at the little tables, the  men mopping their foreheads, everybody ready for bed.    It was close on midnight. As Hibbert passed through the hall to get his  overcoat and snow-boots, he saw men in the passage by the \"sport-room,\"  greasing their ski against an early start. Knapsack luncheons were being  ordered by the kitchen swing doors. He sighed. Lighting a cigarette a  friend offered him, he returned a confused reply to some question as to  whether he could join their party in the morning. It seemed he did not  hear it properly. He passed through the outer vestibule between the  double glass doors, and went into the night.    The man who asked the question watched him go, an expression of anxiety  momentarily in his eyes.    \"Don't think he heard you,\" said another, laughing. \"You've got to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#12)"],[1,"off the bark from trees.         _Membranes_, thin, flexible, expanded skins, connecting the       toes of water-fowl and amphibious animals, and thus enabling       them to swim with greater ease.      Where do Beavers usually fix their habitations?    Their houses are always situated in the water; they are composed of  clay, which they make into a kind of mortar with their paws: these  huts are of an oval figure, divided into three apartments raised one  above the other, and erected on piles driven into the mud. Each beaver  has his peculiar cell assigned him, the floor of which he strews with  leaves or small branches of the pine tree. The whole building is  generally capable of containing eight or ten inhabitants.      On what does the Beaver feed?    Its food consists of fruit and plants; and in winter, of the wood of  the ash and other trees. The hunters and trappers in America formerly  killed vast numbers for their skins, which were in great demand, as  they were used in making hats, but as the only use they are now put to  is for trimming, and for men's gloves and collars, the demand has  fallen off.      Of what are stockings made?    Of cotton, silk, or wool, woven or knitted. Anciently, the only  stockings in use were made of cloth, or stuff sewed together; but  since the invention of knitting and weaving stockings of silk, &c.,  the use of cloth has been discontinued.      From what country is it supposed that the invention of silk knitted  stockings originally came?    From Spain, in 1589. The art of weaving stockings in a frame was  invented by William Lee, M.A., of St. John's College, Cambridge,  England.      Explain the signification of M.A.    Master of Arts, a degree of honor conferred by the Universities.      What are Shoes?    A covering for the foot, now usually made of leather. In different  ages and countries, shoes have been made of various materials, as raw  skins, rushes, broom, paper, silk, wool, iron, silver, and gold.      What nation wore Shoes made of the bark of the papyrus?    The Egyptians. The Turks always take off their shoes, and leave them  at the door, when they enter Mosques or dwelling-houses. The same  custom also prevails in other Eastern nations.      What is a Mosque?    A Mahomedan church or temple.      What is meant by Mahomedan?    Belonging to the religion of Mahomed, the warrior and prophet of  Arabia and Turkey, who was its founder. He was born at Mecca, a city  of Arabia, in 571; and died in 631, at Medina, a city situated between  Arabia Felix and Arabia Deserta. His creed maintains that there is but  one God, and that Mahomed is his Prophet; it enjoins the observance of  prayers, washings, almsgiving, fasting, sobriety, pilgrimage to Mecca,  &c.      What do the appellations of Felix and Deserta signify?    Arabia, a country of Asia, lying on the borders of the Red Sea, is  divided into Petraea, Deserta, and Felix; Petraea, signifying the Stony;  Deserta, the Desert; and Felix, the fortunate or fruitful.      What is Leather?    The skins of various animals, as oxen, cows, calves, &c., dressed and  prepared for use.      How is the Leather prepared?    By tanning; that is, steeping the skins in an infusion of tan, by  which they are rendered firm, durable, and, in a great degree,  impervious to water.         _Infusion_, a liquor made by steeping anything in water, or       other liquids, without boiling.      What is Tan?    The bark of the oak-tree, &c., ground by a mill into a coarse powder.      What is Lime?[5]    A white, soft, friable, earthy substance, prepared from marble, chalk,  and other lime-stones, or from shells, by burning in a kiln.    [Footnote 5: For a further account of it, see Chapters XIII. & XVI.]         _Friable_, easily powdered.      For what is it used?    Its greatest use is in the composition of mortar for building; it is  also much used by tanners, skinners, &c., in the preparation of  leather; by soap-boilers in the manufacture of soap; and by  sugar-bakers for refining sugar.      What is a Kiln?    A fabric of brick or stone, formed for admitting heat in order to dry  or burn materials placed in it.      Of what are Gloves made?    Of leather, silk, thread, cotton, worsted, &c.      What skins are generally used for Gloves?    Those of the chamois, kid, lamb, dog, doe, and many other animals.      What are Furs, and how are they prepared?    Furs are the skins of wild animals, dressed with the hair on, and used  as apparel, either for warmth, ornament, or distinction of rank or  dignity.      Name a few of the principal furs in use.    The fur of the ermine, an animal inhabiting the cold regions of Europe  and America, is highly valued, and much used for ornamental purposes.  In summer, the upper part of the body is of a yellowish-brown color;  the under parts white, slightly tinged with yellow. It is then called  a _stoat_. In winter, the fur is closer and finer, and is of a snowy  white color; the tip of the tail is black throughout the year. In  Europe the fur is much used for ornamenting the state robes of  sovereigns and nobles. The sable is another animal much prized for its  rich fur; it is a native of Northern Europe and America. The skins of  the marten, found in North America, as well as in Northern Asia and  the mountains of Kamtschatka; and also of the bear, fox, raccoon,  badger, lynx, musk-rat, rabbit, hare, and squirrel, which are all  procured in North America, are valuable. One of the most valuable  descriptions of fur is that of the seal.      How is it procured?    By hunting the animals, which is the employment both of natives and  settlers from other countries; the hunters sell the skins for money,  to a company established for the purpose of trading in furs, or more  frequently exchange them for clothes, arms, and other articles. The  Alaska Commercial Company of San Francisco is granted by the United  States Government the exclusive privilege of catching the fur seal.      What is Alum?    A kind of mineral, of a strong, sharp taste. It dissolves both in cold  and boiling water, but best in the latter. It is of some use in  medicine; a principal ingredient in dyeing and coloring, neither of  which can be well performed without it, as it sets and brightens the  colors, and prevents them from washing out. It is also extremely  useful in many arts and manufactures.      Are there not different sorts of this material?    The principal kinds are native alums: _viz._ those prepared and  perfected underground by the spontaneous operations of nature; as the  roch, commonly called rock alum, from Rocha, in Syria, whence it is  brought.         _Spontaneous_, unassisted by art.         _Orientals_, inhabitants of the Eastern parts of the world.      What is Ink?    A liquor used in writing on paper or parchment, made of copperas,  galls; and gum arabic[6] mixed together. There are likewise several  plants that may serve for the making of ink, as oak-bark, red roses,  log-wood, &c. It is also made from an infusion of oak galls and iron  filings: there are also many other ways, as well as materials,  employed in the making of this useful article. Ink is the name applied  to all liquids used in writing, of whatever color they may be, as red,  blue, &c., though black is the most used for common purposes. The ink  of the ancients seems to have been of a thick, oily nature, unlike the  modern ink; it consisted of nothing more than a species of soot, or  ivory black, mixed with one fourth of gum.    [Footnote 6: See Chapter XI.]      What is Copperas?    A kind of vitriol. Copperas is the name given to green vitriol, which  is a preparation from iron. The blue vitriol is a sulphate of copper,  and the white vitriol a sulphate of zinc.      For what is Vitriol used?    In the making of glass, to color it; in many arts and manufactures;  and in medicine.      What are Galls?    Excrescences formed on a kind of oak tree in certain warm climates;  perforations are made by an insect into the bark of the tree, whence  issues a liquid which hardens by exposure. They are used in dyeing,  making ink, and other compositions. There are two sorts of oak galls  in our shops, brought from the Levant, and the southern parts of  Europe.      What does the word Levant signify?    A country to the eastward. It is applied to the countries of Turkey,  Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, &c., which are washed by the eastern  part of the Mediterranean.      Is the Ink used in Printing the same as writing Ink?    No; it is more of the nature of paint, being thicker and more  glutinous: it chiefly consists of a mixture of oil and lamp-black, or  some other ingredient, according to the color required; and is  remarkable for the ease with which it adheres to paper that is  moistened.         _Glutinous_, gummy, resembling glue.      What is Indian, or Chinese Ink?    An admirable composition, not liquid like our ink, but solid, and made  into cakes somewhat like the mineral colors we use in painting. It is  made into all sorts of figures, usually long, and about an inch thick;  sometimes gilt with the figures of birds, flowers, &c. To use this  ink, it must be rubbed with water, on stone or earthenware, till it  produces a beautiful, liquid, shining black. It is used in drawing,  &c., and is brought from China. It is composed of lamp-black and size,  or animal glue, or gum, to which perfumes and other substances are  sometimes added.          CHAPTER X.    ASBESTUS, SALT, COAL, IRON, COPPER, BRASS, ZINC, AND LAPIS  CALAMINARIS.      What is the name of the remarkable stone of which a cloth has been  made, that resists the action of fire?    The Asbestus, a mineral substance of a whitish or silver color. There  are several species of this mineral, which are distinguished by  different names, according to the appearance of each, as fibrous  asbestus, hard asbestus, and woody asbestus; it is the fibrous sort  which is most noted for its "]]]
