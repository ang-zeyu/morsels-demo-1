[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#12)"],[1," saddled and accoutred as quietly as  possible--his warm clothing put over the saddle immediately, and everything  kept as much in the usual course as possible, so that the noble animal's  temper might not be ruffled by unaccustomed trouble or unusual objects.  Leather having seen that the horse could not eject Mr. Sponge even in  trousers, had little fear of his dislodging him in boots and breeches;  still it was desirable to avoid all unseemly contention, and maintain the  high character of the stud, by which means Leather felt that his own  character and consequence would best be maintained. Accordingly, he  refrained from calling in the aid of any of the stable assistants,  preferring for once to do a little work himself, especially when the rider  was up to the trick, and not 'a gent' to be cajoled into 'trying a horse.'  Mr. Sponge, punctual to his time, appeared at the stable, and after much  patting, whistling, so--so--ing, my man, and general ingratiation, the  redoubtable nag was led out of the stable into a well-littered straw-yard,  where, though he might be gored by a bull if he fell, the 'eyes of England'  at all events would not witness the floorer. Horses, however, have  wonderful memories and discrimination. Though so differently attired to  what he was on the occasion of his trial, the horse seemed to recognize Mr.  Sponge, and independently of a few snorts as he was led out, and an  indignant stamp or two of his foot as it was let down, after Mr. Sponge was  mounted he took things very quietly.    'Now,' said Leather, in an undertone, patting the horse's arched neck,  'I'll give you a hint; they're a goin' to run a drag to try what he's made  on, so be on the look-out.'    'How do you know?' asked Mr. Sponge, in surprise, drawing his reins as he  spoke.    '_I know_,' replied Mr. Leather with a wink.    Just then the horse began to plunge, and paw, and give symptoms of  uneasiness, and not wishing to fret or exhibit his weak points, Mr. Sponge  gave him his head, and passing through the side-gate was presently in the  street. He didn't exactly understand it, but having full confidence in his  horsemanship, and believing the one he was on required nothing but riding,  he was not afraid to take his chance.    Not being the man to put his candle under a bushel, Mr. Sponge took the  principal streets on his way out of town. We are not sure that he did not  go rather out of his way to get them in, but that is neither here nor  there, seeing he was a stranger who didn't know the way. What a sensation  his appearance created as the gallant brown stepped proudly and freely up  Coronation Street, showing his smart, clean, well-put-on head up and down  on the unrestrained freedom of the snaffle.    'Oh, d--n it, there he is!' exclaimed Mr. Spareneck, jumping up from the  breakfast-table, and nearly sweeping the contents off by catching the cloth  with his spur.    'Where?' exclaimed half-a-dozen voices, amid a general rush to the windows.    'What a fright!' exclaimed little Miss Martindale, whispering into Miss  Beauchamp's ear: 'I'm sure anybody may have him for me,' though she felt in  her heart that he was far from bad looking.    'I wonder how long he's taken to put on that choker,' observed Mr.  Spareneck, eyeing him intently, not without an inward qualm that he had set  himself a more difficult task than he imagined, to 'cut him down,'  especially when he looked at the noble animal he bestrode, and the masterly  way he sat him.    'What a pair of profligate boots,' observed Captain Whitfield, as our  friend now passed his lodgings.    'It would be the duty of a right-thinking man to ride over a fellow in such  a pair,' observed his friend, Mr. Cox, who was breakfasting with him.    'Ride over a fellow in such a pair!' exclaimed Whitfield. 'No well-bred  horse would face such things, I should think.'    'He seems to think a good deal of himself!' observed Mr. Cox, as Sponge  cast an admiring eye down his shining boot.    'Shouldn't wonder,' replied Whitfield; 'perhaps he'll have the conceit  taken out of him before night.'    'Well, I hope you'll be in time, old boy!' exclaimed Mr. Waffles to  himself, as looking down from his bedroom window, he espied Mr. Sponge  passing up the street on his way to cover. Mr. Waffles was just out of bed,  and had yet to dress and breakfast.    One man in scarlet sets all the rest on the fidget, and without troubling  to lay 'that or that' together, they desert their breakfasts, hurry to the  stables, get out their horses and rattle away, lest their watches should be  wrong or some arrangement made that they are ignorant of. The hounds too,  were on, as was seen as well by their footmarks, as by the bob, bob,  bobbing of sundry black caps above the hedges, on the Borrowdon road as the  huntsman and whips proceeded at that pleasant post-boy trot, that has  roused the wrath of so many riders against horses that they could not get  to keep in time.    Now look at old Tom, cocked jauntily on the spicey bay and see what a  different Tom he is to what he was last night. Instead of a battered,  limping, shabby-looking little old man, he is all alive and rises to the  action of his horse, as though they were all one. A fringe of grey hair  protrudes beneath his smart velvet cap, which sets off a weather-beaten but  keen and expressive face, lit up with little piercing black eyes. See how  chirpy and cheery he is; how his right arm keeps rising and falling with  his whip, beating responsive to the horse's action with the butt-end  against his thigh. His new scarlet coat imparts a healthy hue to his face,  and good boots and breeches hide the imperfections of his bad legs. His  hounds seem to partake of the old man's gaiety, and gather round his horse  or frolic forward on the grassy sidings of the road, till, getting almost  out of earshot, a single 'yooi doit!--Arrogant!'--or 'here again, Brusher!'  brings them cheerfully back to whine and look in the old man's  face for applause. Nor is he chary of his praise. 'G--oood  betch!--Arrogant!--g--oood betch!' says he, leaning over his horse's  shoulder towards her, and jerking his hand to induce her to proceed forward  again. So the old man trots gaily on, now making of his horse, now coaxing  a hound, now talking to a 'whip,' now touching or taking off his cap as he  passes a sportsman, according to the estimation in which he holds him.    As the hounds reach Whirleypool Windmill, there is a grand rush of  pedestrians to meet them. First comes a velveteen-jacketed,  leather-legginged keeper, with whom Tom (albeit suspicious of his honesty)  thinks it prudent to shake hands; the miller and he, too, greet; and  forthwith a black bottle with a single glass make their appearance, and  pass current with the company. Then the earth-stopper draws nigh, and,  resting a hand on Tom's horse's shoulder, whispers confidentially in his  ear. The pedestrian sportsman of the country, too, has something to say;  also a horse-breaker; while groups of awe-stricken children stand staring  at the mighty Tom, thinking him the greatest man in the world.    Railways and fox-hunting make most people punctual, and in less than five  minutes from the halting of the hounds by the Windmill, the various roads  leading up to it emit dark-coated grooms, who, dismounting, proceed to  brush off the mud sparks, and rectify any little derangement the horses or  their accoutrements may have contracted on the journey. Presently Mr.  Sponge, and such other gentlemen as have ridden their own horses on, cast  up, while from the eminence the road to Laverick Wells is distinctly  traceable with scarlet coats and flys, with furs and flaunting feathers.  Presently the foremost riders begin to canter up the hill, when          All around is gay, men, horses, dogs,      And in each smiling countenance appears      Fresh blooming health and universal joy.    Then the ladies mingle with the scene, some on horseback, some in flys, all  chatter and prattle as usual, some saying smart things, some trying, all  making themselves as agreeable as possible, and of course as captivating.  Some were in ecstasies at dear Miss Jumpheavy's ball--she was such a _nice_  creature--such a charming ball, and so well managed, while others were  anticipating the delights of Mrs. Tom Hoppey's, and some again were asking  which was Mr. Sponge. Then up went the eye-glasses, while Mr. Sponge sat  looking as innocent and as killing as he could. 'Dear me!' exclaimed one,  'he's younger than I thought.' 'That's him, is it?' observed another; 'I  saw him ride up the street'; while the propriety-playing ones praised his  horse, and said it was a beauty.    The hounds, which they all had come to see, were never looked at.    Mr. Waffles, like many men with nothing to do, was most unpunctual. He  never seemed to know what o'clock it was, and yet he had a watch, hung in  chains, and gewgaws, like a lady's chatelaine. Hunting partook of the  general confusion. He did not profess to throw off till eleven, but it was  often nearly twelve before he cast up. Then he would come up full tilt,  surrounded by 'scarlets,' like a general with his staff; and once at the  meet, there was a prodigious hurry to begin, equalled only by the eagerness  to leave off. On this auspicious day he hove in sight, coming best pace  along the road, about twenty minutes before twelve, with a more numerous  retinue than usual. In dress, Mr. Waffles was the light, butterfly order of  sportsman--once-round tie, French polish, paper boots, and so on. On this  occasion he sported a shirt-collar with three or four blue lines, and then  a white space followed by three or more blue lines, the whole terminating  in blue spots about the size of fourpenny pieces at the points; a  once-round blue silk tie, with white spots and flying ends. His coat was a  light, jackety sort of thing, with little pockets behind, something in the  style"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#12)"],[1,"proprietary character until the  Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their  governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees  of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,  retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone  had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.    The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed  high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every  turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,  appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and  reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief  of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in  time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except  Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of  the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.  He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower  house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and  he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America  all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had  protested and Cromwell had battled in England.    [Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]    The colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of  office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen  of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The  pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges  granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen  popular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to  adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The  reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which  they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.    =The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward  administration through royal governors was the second and opposite  tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.  The voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and  law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early  introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when  its first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of  Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of  the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was  adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative  system under their \"Fundamental Orders\" of 1639, and the entire colony  was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical  considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William  Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any  considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every  one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.    It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was  finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning  toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to  be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no  house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.  In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter  of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year  at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In  Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres  or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons  worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.    Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very  considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of  the towns, who were by no means content with their position.  Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small  freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion  of the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the  limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.    The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged  in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by  the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,  the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the  interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of  money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a  treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the  mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious  officials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to  force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.    =Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many  and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors  and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how  the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to  sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly  humor, Franklin adds: \"Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our  proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in  legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own  before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value  of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so  blessed.\"    It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily  as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like  Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon  executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If  we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America  was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the  friends of the governor complained in 1747 that \"the inhabitants of  plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon  republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of  royal authority remains in the Northern colonies.\" \"Here,\" echoed the  governor of South Carolina, the following year, \"levelling principles  prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if  he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their  whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the  assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical  preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people.\"    Though baffled by the \"levelling principles\" of the colonial assemblies,  the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved  a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the  obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters  to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal  officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures  by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was  to be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to  be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.    Such a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many  ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army  independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry  out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both  practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh  from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It  failed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing  strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the  tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or  how benevolent its intentions.      =References=    A.M.
