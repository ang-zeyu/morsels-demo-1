In the case of the  Antarctic flights (which were engaged on what may be described as a  return trip without touch-down) the southernmost waypoint, like each of  the intermediate positions, was really a reference point to which the  pilot knew the aircraft would be committed if it were left to follow the  computer-directed flight track. And as mentioned the southern point for  the preferred route to the McMurdo area was a ground installation at  Williams Field.    During 1977 the co-ordinates for each waypoint which comprised the  Antarctic routes had not been stored on magnetic tape for automatic  retrieval and insertion into the navigation computer units of the  aircraft. Instead the flight plan was dealt with manually and upon issue  to the aircrew at the time of departure was manually typed by the pilot  concerned into the aircraft computer units. When the Air New Zealand  ground based computer was used in 1978 to produce computerised Antarctic  flight plans they followed the same format as those that had been  produced earlier. But before the ground computer could be programmed it  had been necessary for an officer of the navigation section to prepare a  written worksheet containing all the waypoints and their respective  latitude and longitude co-ordinates which then were transcribed from the  worksheet. And by reference to the original flight plan used in February  1977 this was done by Mr Hewitt, one of the four members of the  navigation section at airline headquarters. He said in evidence before  the Royal Commission that when he went on to take from his written  worksheet the longitude co-ordinates of the McMurdo waypoint he  mistakenly transcribed the correct figures of 166 deg. 48' as 164 deg.  48' by inadvertently typing the figure \"4\" twice. This had the effect of  moving the McMurdo waypoint 25 nautical miles to the west and once in the  aircraft's system the navigation track which then it would follow from  Cape Hallett when under automatic control would be over the[1] Sound  rather than directly to Williams Field.    At this point it should be mentioned that the print-out of a flight plan  shows not merely the co-ordinate waypoints but also a finely calculated  statement of the direction and distance between them. This last  information is obtained independently from what is called the NV90  programme of the computer which is able automatically to calculate the  rhumb line track and distance between each of the respective waypoints  once the co-ordinates have been fed into it. This information forms the  basis for the data required to produce the computerised flight plan. So  that finally when a print-out of the plan is obtained it will disclose  not merely the geographical co-ordinates for each waypoint but the true  track direction and the distance in nautical miles from one to the next.  That last information is needed prior to a flight departure in order to  calculate tonnages of fuel during the prospective journey and  accordingly as a flight proceeds it enables the quantity of fuel already  consumed to be checked against the anticipated consumption in the flight  plan print-out. Thus the precise track and distance is used for purposes  of fuel calculations and has importance as a check in navigation.    All this information is disclosed on page 96 of the Royal Commission  Report where the print-out is shown for the flight plan with the  co-ordinates for McMurdo showing the longitude as 164 deg. 48' east. In the  next column the track direction is given as 188.9 deg. (grid) and the  distance between Cape Hallett and McMurdo as 337 miles. On the facing  page 97 there is a print-out of the flight plan actually used on the  fatal flight which shows the correction made to the longitude, 166 deg. 58'  east. It will shortly be mentioned that when that correction was made  the navigation section say it was thought to involve a minor movement of  only 2.1 miles or 10 minutes of longitude. Despite the very small change  that this could make to the track and distance between the two points a  re-calculation was made and entered into the computer programme as  188.5 deg. (grid) and the distance 336 miles. Compared with the other  figures the difference seems minimal but it was still thought necessary  to assess it and it was done.      The Western Waypoint    The circumstances surrounding the use of the 164 deg. 48' E figures were in  issue before the Royal Commission. It was suggested against the airline  they had not been introduced accidentally: that the movement of the  position 25 miles to the west had been deliberate. If that were so it  would seem that a re-calculation of track and distance would have been  needed and made both for the fuel plan and also as a check for purposes  of navigation. However, no re-calculation of track and distance was made  and entered with the 164 deg. 48' co-ordinate. The figures which actually  appear for track and distance to that point remain precisely the track  and distance figures which were shown in the flight plan to the 166 deg.  48' point for the first flight in February 1977. For purposes of comparison  a calculation to the \"false\" waypoint was prepared and put before the  Royal Commission. It showed that a direct track from Cape Hallett to  that point is actually 191 deg. and the distance 343 miles. The point is  referred to in paragraph 230 of the Report within a section headed \"The  creation of the false McMurdo waypoint and how it came to be changed  without the knowledge of Captain Collins\".    In paragraph 229 it is said that submissions had been put to the  Commissioner that \"the shifting of the McMurdo waypoint was done  deliberately so as to conform\" with a track used by military aircraft  proceeding to Williams Field. Then in paragraph 230 there is a summary  of contrary arguments advanced by members of the navigation section to  support their claim of accident. They include--         \"(c) It was pointed out that if the McMurdo waypoint had been       intentionally moved 25 miles to the west, then the flight plan       would have a corresponding change to the track and distance       information which it previously contained. Instead of a true       heading from Cape Hallett to the NDB of 188.9 deg. and a distance of       337 nautical miles, there would have been required, in respect of       the changed McMurdo waypoint, a true heading of 191 deg. and 343       nautical miles. Similar alterations would have had to be made in       respect of a return journey to the true north.\"    That is the matter already outlined. Concerning it the Commissioner said  in paragraph 234 that there was \"considerable validity in this point\"  although then he added:         \"... the Navigation Section may have thought it not necessary to       alter the track and distance criteria from Cape Hallett to McMurdo       for the reason that the pilots were accustomed to flying on Heading       Select down this sector and not by reference to the fixed heading       programmed into the AINS.\"    There is a further argument of the navigation section which is  summarized in paragraph 230 (e)--         \"It was submitted that an alteration to the McMurdo waypoint to       facilitate better sightseeing was not valid because flight captains       had a discretion to deviate horizontally from the flight plan       track.\"    The Commissioner accepted that point as \"a valid objection\" in answer to  the suggestion that the move had been deliberate (paragraph 236).    However when he came in paragraph 255 (a) to express his final  conclusion upon this general question he initially said this--         \"The first question is whether the programming of the McMurdo       waypoint into the 'false' position before the commencement of the       1978 flights was the result of accident or design. On balance, it       seems likely that this transposition of the McMurdo waypoint was       deliberate.\"    There is reference at that point to a track and distance diagram  indicating a track down McMurdo Sound, and the sub-paragraph then  continues--         \"So as I say, I think it likely that the change of the McMurdo       destination point was intended and was designed by the Navigation       Section to give aircraft a nav track for the final leg of the       journey which would keep the aircraft well clear of high ground.\"    Then the final portion of paragraph 255 (a) leaves the matter in the  following half-way situation--         \"However, I propose to make no positive finding on this point. I       must pay regard to the circumstance strongly urged upon me by       counsel for the airline in their closing submissions, namely, that       if the alteration was intentional then it was not accompanied by       the normal realignment of the aircraft's heading so as to join up       with the new waypoint. As I say, I think this latter omission is       capable of explanation but it is a material fact in favour of the       Navigation Section which I cannot disregard, and it is the single       reason why I refrain from making a positive finding that the       alteration of the waypoint was intentional.\"    It may be that in speaking of a single reason in the last sentence of  the extract the Commissioner put aside his earlier unqualified  conclusion that the matter set out in paragraph 230 (e) was also \"a  valid objection\" to the suggestion that the waypoint had been moved  deliberately. In any event the eventual and significant finding  concerning the matter is contained in the following sub-paragraph 255  (b):         \"I believe, however, that the error made by Mr Hewitt was       ascertained long before Captain Simpson reported the cross-track       distance of 27 miles between the TACAN and the McMurdo waypoint,       and I am satisfied that because"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#12)"],[1," they remained here another twenty-four hours Gatacre would have had them in  a ring of iron, but the Boer general is no fool. He saw his danger, and,  like a wise man, he dodged it. Gatacre's generalship was simply superb. Let  the idiotic band of critics who sit in safety in England howl to their  heart's content; Gatacre deserves well of his country. Had he dashed  recklessly into this hornet's nest he would have sacrificed four-fifths of  his gallant officers and a host of his men. Had I to write his military  epitaph to-day I should say that \"he won with brains what most generals  would have won with blood.\"    Strangely enough, I was a prisoner in the very room where I am penning this  epistle only last Saturday night. I left here in the centre of a Boer  commando, with a bandage over my eyes, on Sunday morning, and returned to  the spot surrounded by British \"Tommies\" a few days later.    All the glory of this bloodless victory does not rest with the general who  commands the column. To Captain Tennant no small meed of praise is due.  This officer was here on secret service before hostilities commenced, and  he did his work so thoroughly that the country is as familiar to him as  paint to a barmaid. He is one of those men, unfortunately so rare in the  British Army, combining dash and dauntless pluck with a cool, level head.  If he gets his opportunity, England will hear more of this officer. I have  been intensely struck by the class of officers by whom General Gatacre is  surrounded. They all look like soldiers. I have not seen a single dude, not  one of those wretched fops of whom I have seen only too many in South  Africa. They speak like soldiers too. No idiotic drawl, no effeminate lisp,  no bullying, ill-bred, coarseness of tongue; they are neither drawing-room  dandies nor camp swashbucklers, but officers and gentlemen--and, I can  assure you, the terms are not always synonymous, even under the Queen's  cloth. I have seen mere lads in this country leading men into action who in  point of brains were not fit to lead a mule to water, and others who, in  regard to manners, were scarcely fit to follow the mule. But, thank God,  the Boers have taught our nation this, if they have taught us nought  else--that it needs something more than an eye-glass, a lisp, a pair of kid  gloves, and an insolent, overbearing manner to make a successful soldier.    But let me get amongst the Boers. I was only a prisoner in their hands for  about a month, yet every moment of that time was so fraught with interest  that I fancy I picked up more of the real nature of the Boers than I should  have done under ordinary circumstances in a couple of years. I was moved  from laager to laager along their fighting line, saw them at work with  their rifles, saw them come in from more than one tough skirmish, bringing  their dead and wounded with them, saw them when they had triumphed, and saw  them when they had been whipped; saw them going to their farms, to be  welcomed by wife and children; saw them leaving home with a wife's sobs in  their ears, and children's loving kisses on their lips. I saw some of these  old greyheads shattered by our shells, dying grimly, with knitted brows and  fiercely clenched jaws; saw some of their beardless boys sobbing their  souls out as the life blood dyed the African heath. I saw some passing over  the border line which divides life and death, with a ring of stern-browed  comrades round them, leaning upon their rifles, whilst a brother or a  father knelt and pressed the hand of him whose feet were on the very  threshold of the land beyond the shadows. I saw others smiling up into the  faces of women--the poor, pain-drawn faces of the dying looking less  haggard and worn than the anguish-stricken features of their womanhood who  knelt to comfort them in that last awful hour--in the hour which divides  time from eternity, the sunlight of lusty life from the shadows of  unsearchable death. Those things I have seen, and in the ears of English  men and English women, let me say, as one who knows, and fain would speak  the plain, ungilded truth concerning friend and foe, that, not alone  beneath the British flag are heroes found. Not alone at the breasts of  British matrons are brave men suckled; for, as my soul liveth--whether  their cause be just or unjust, whether the right or the wrong of this war  be with them, whether the blood of the hundreds who have fallen since the  first rifle spoke defiance shall speak for or against them at the day of  judgment--they at least know how to die; and when a man has given his life  for the cause he believes in he is proven worthy even of his worst enemy's  respect. And it seems to me that the British nation, with its long roll of  heroic deeds, wrought the whole world over, from Africa to Iceland, can  well afford to honour the splendid bravery and self-sacrifice of these  rude, untutored tillers of the soil. I have seen them die.    Once, as I lay a prisoner in a rocky ravine all through the hot afternoon,  I heard the rifles snapping like hounds around a cornered beast. I watched  the Boers as they moved from cover to cover, one here, one there, a little  farther on a couple in a place of vantage, again, in a natural fortress, a  group of eight; so they were placed as far as my eye could reach. The  British force I could not see at all; they were out on the veldt, and the  kopjes hid them from me; but I could hear the regular roll and ripple of  their disciplined volleys, and in course of time, by watching the actions  of the Boers, I could anticipate the sound. They watched our officers, and  when the signal to fire was given they dropped behind cover with such speed  and certainty that seldom a man was hit. Then, when the leaden hail had  ceased to fall upon the rocks, they sprang out again, and gave our fellows  lead for lead. After a while our gunners seemed to locate them, and the  shells came through the air, snarling savagely, as leopards snarl before  they spring, and the flying shrapnel reached many of the Boers, wounding,  maiming, or killing them; yet they held their position with indomitable  pluck, those who were not hit leaping out, regardless of personal danger,  to pick up those who were wounded. They were a strange, motley-looking  crowd, dressed in all kinds of common farming apparel, just such a crowd as  one is apt to see in a far inland shearing shed in Australia, but no man  with a man's heart in his body could help admiring their devotion to one  another or their loyalty to the cause they were risking their lives for.    One sight I saw which will stay with me whilst memory lasts. They had  placed me under a waggon under a mass of overhanging rock for safety, and  there they brought two wounded men. One was a man of fifty, a hard old  veteran, with a complexion as dark as a New Zealand Maori; the beard that  framed the rugged face was three-fourths grey, his hands were as rough and  knotted by open air toil as the hoofs of a working steer.    He looked what he was--a Boer of mixed Dutch and French lineage. Later on I  got into conversation with him, and he told me a good deal of his life. His  father was descended from one of the old Dutch families who had emigrated  to South Africa in search of religious liberty in the old days, when the  country was a wilderness. His mother had come in an unbroken line from one  of the noble families of France who fled from home in the days of the  terrible persecution of the Huguenots. He himself had been many  things--hunter, trader, farmer, fighting man. He had fought against the  natives, and he had fought against our people. The younger man was his son,  a tall, fair fellow, scarcely more than a stripling, and I had no need to  be a prophet or a prophet's son to tell that his very hours were numbered.  Both the father and the lad had been wounded by one of our shells, and it  was pitiful to watch them as they lay side by side, the elder man holding  the hand of the younger in a loving clasp, whilst with his other hand he  stroked the boyish face with gestures that were infinitely pathetic. Just  as the stars were coming out that night between the clouds that floated  over us the Boer boy sobbed his young life out, and all through the long  watches of that mournful darkness the father lay with his dead laddie's  hand in his. The pain of his own wounds must have been dreadful, but I  heard no moan of anguish from his lips. When, at the dawning, they came to  take the dead boy from the living man, the stern old warrior simply pressed  his grizzled lips to the cold face, and then turned his grey beard to the  hard earth and made no further sign; but I knew well that, had the  sacrifice been possible, he would gladly have given his life to save the  young one's.                                  A BOER FIGHTING LAAGER.                                                                  BURGHERSDORP.      Many and wonderful are the stories written and published concerning the  Boer and his habits when on the war-path. Most of these stories are written  by men who take good care never to get within a hundred miles of the  fighting line, but content themselves with an easy chair, a cigar, a bottle  of whisky, and carpet slippers on the stoep of some good hotel in a pretty  little Boer town. To scribes of this calibre flock a certain class of  British resident, who is always full to the very ears of his own dauntless  courage, his deathless loyalty to the Queen and Empire, his love for the  soldier, and his hatred of the Boer. This gallant class of British resident  has half a million excuses ready to his hand to explain why he did not take  a rifle and fight when the war summons rang clarion-like through the land.  Then he grits his teeth, knits his eyebrows, clenches his hands in  spasmodic wrath, throws out his chest, and tells his auditors, in a voice  husky with concentrated wrath and whisky, what"]]]
