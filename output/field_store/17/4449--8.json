GARDEN HELPS    Conducted by Minnesota Garden Flower Society    Edited by MRS. E. W. GOULD, 2644 Humboldt Avenue So.  Minneapolis.    SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE USE OF COAL ASHES--      This is the time of the year when the unsightly heaps of coal ashes are  likely to appear in one's back yard--eyesores and apparently useless.    Yet there are several ways in which they can be used to advantage about  the garden.    They should first be sifted, using a quarter-inch wire mesh. The rough  or coarser parts are well adapted for use on paths and driveways,  forming a clean, firm surface with use. These paths are especially good  in the garden, for weeds do not grow readily in them, and they dry off  quickly after a rain.    Such parts of the ashes as will pass through an inch mesh will make a  very good summer mulch about fruit trees and bushes that require such  care. This mulch will conserve the moisture at the roots of the tree or  plant at a time when it is very necessary to have it.    About a pyramid of these coarse ashes one may plant anything that  requires much water. The roots of the plants will run under the ashes  and keep moist and cool. Through a drought a little water poured upon  the ashes will be distributed to the roots without loss.    The fine sifted ashes will render the tougher hard soils more friable,  their chief virtue being lightening it. In a very mild degree they are a  fertilizer, though in no degree comparable in this respect to hardwood  ashes. Yet it has been proved that soil to which sifted coal ashes had  been added grew plants of richer, darker foliage. They must be very well  mixed with the soil by a thorough spading and forking.    The following experiment was noted in the Garden Magazine: A soil was  prepared as follows: One-eighth stable manure, one-eighth leaf mold,  one-quarter garden soil (heavy), one-half sifted coal ashes. Plants  grown in this soil surpassed those grown in the garden soil next to  them.    Coal ashes would not be advised for a light soil.           *       *       *       *       *    Watch this page for announcement of Garden Flower Society meetings.

The Minnesota Cypripediums. Can they be successfully cultivated? Miss  Clara Leavitt.    Five-minute talks on \"The Best Things of 1915.\"    Members are urged to bring their friends to this meeting. No one who  contemplates having a garden this year can afford to miss it. Let us be  generous and share our good programs with as many as possible. Each  member is host or hostess for that day.          SECRETARY'S CORNER      ANNUAL MEETING WISCONSIN STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCY.--This  meeting is to be held at Madison, Wis., on January 5-7. Mr. Chas.  Haralson, superintendent of our State Fruit-Breeding Farm, is to  represent this society at that meeting. We may look for an interesting  report from him in the February issue of our monthly.    IS YOUR ANNUAL FEE PAID?--If not, won't you please send it in  promptly, remitting by a $1.00 bill, which is a safe medium of payment,  instead of using check unless you draw on a bank in one of the larger  cities of the state. Checks on country banks, as a rule, can only be  collected here by a payment of ten cents, which the society can ill  afford to pay for so many members.    ANNUAL MEETING S.D. HORT. SOCY.--The annual gathering of this  sister association will be held in Huron, S.D., January 18-20. Quite a  good many of our members live so near the state line that they may find  it convenient to attend this meeting, which will certainly be a  profitable one. Prof. N. E. Hansen is secretary. Mr. Wm. Pfaender, Jr.,  of New Ulm, is to be the representative of this society at the South  Dakota meeting.    ANNUAL MEETING SOUTHERN MINNESOTA HORT. SOCY.--This very  wide-awake auxiliary of the state society will hold its annual meeting  in Austin, January 19th and 20th next. The program of the meeting is not  yet at hand, but you may be sure that it will be an interesting and  practical one. If the reader is living anywhere within convenient range  of Austin by all means attend this meeting and get inspiration and help  for the work of another season.    YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN.--This refers to members of the society  who have paid their annual fee for 1916 and are wondering why they have  not yet received the membership ticket. There is always a little  unavoidable delay in sending out these tickets after the annual meeting.  First the tickets must be printed, and then the society folder that goes  out with them must be prepared, and the material making up this folder  comes from quite a number of sources, and it takes more or less time to  get all of these matters together and in shape. You need not be  solicitous in regard to membership fees remitted, as the chance of loss  in transmission is approximately nothing; hardly half a dozen instances  of the kind have come up in the twenty-five years of service of the  secretary.    PASSING OF MICHAEL BENDEL, SR.--This old member of our society  and resident of Madison has just been called away, December 23rd, at the  age of seventy-nine years. While not an attendant at our meetings he was  a most loyal member of the society, and especially conspicuous in the  western part of the state, where he lived, as a successful experimenter  in orcharding, in which work he had a large experience. His portrait and  a brief sketch of his life appear in the 1914 volume of our report, on  page 150. Mr. Bendel was for many years president of the Lac qui Parle  County Agricultural Society, was always greatly interested in everything  to improve the interests of his community, and especially those  pertaining to farm life. He has left an enviable record.    FARMERS AND HOME MAKERS WEEK.--University Farm, midway between  Minneapolis and St. Paul, have prepared a royal program for all  interested in agricultural work and life, including the needs of the  household, filling all of next week, from January 3rd to 8th, inclusive.  Seventy-nine professors and instructors by count are on the program for  the week, and it is so arranged that those attending pass from one  lecture room to another, from hour to hour, selecting the subjects that  they have a special interest in. Horticulture, or subjects closely akin,  have a place on this program Monday afternoon, Tuesday forenoon and  afternoon, Wednesday forenoon and Thursday forenoon; Thursday afternoon  the horticultural program is devoted entirely to vegetables; Friday  forenoon and afternoon; and Saturday forenoon altogether spraying. When  this magazine is received it will be too late to send for a program, but  not too late to attend the meetings, which we hope many of our members  may have the opportunity to do.    ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETING.--The badge book, which is issued  at every annual meeting, containing the list of those who notify the  secretary of a purpose to attend the meeting, is a pretty good index of  the attendance. This year the badge book contained 442 names. Of course  not all of these were present at the meeting, but a great many who were  there had not sent notice of attendance and whose names were not in the  badge book, so that the figures given elsewhere in this magazine as to  attendance, estimated at from 400 to 500, are certainly not any too  high.    Of this number not to exceed fifteen members, including vice presidents  and superintendents of trial stations living at a distance, receive  their railroad fare to and from the annual meeting, which is the only  compensation they receive for their work in operating the trial stations  and preparing the annual or semi-annual reports connected with their  positions. This is not in fact any compensation for service but rather a  recognition of the large obligation under which the society rests  towards them for such gratuitous service.    PLANT PREMIUMS FOR 1916.--On the inside front cover page of  this monthly will be found a list of the plant premiums offered to our  membership the coming spring. This list is also published in the society  folder, of which copies will be sent to each member and which can be  supplied in any number desired by application to the secretary. The list  of plant premiums includes a considerable variety of plants both  ornamental and otherwise useful. Those of special interest this year are  the new fruits being sent out from the State Fruit-Breeding Farm,  including No. 3 June-bearing strawberry, which gives promise of being a  very valuable fruit for Minnesota planters; No. 1017 everbearing  strawberry, the kind which has been selected from thousands of varieties  fruiting at the station, a good plant maker and also a prolific fruiter  of high quality berries; No. 4 raspberry, a variety of extraordinary  vigor and hardiness, large fruited, and a prolific bearer; and several  varieties of large fruited plums. Every member of the society with  facilities for growing fruits should be interested in trying these new  varieties, which of course are still being sent out on trial, and we  desire to hear from our membership as to their measure of success with  them.

The  Gileadites were saved; and for years to come they remembered Saul with  gratitude.      THE KINGDOM OF SAUL    Shortly after this victory there was a great gathering of the Hebrews  of Benjamin and some of the neighboring tribes and Saul was elected as  king. Would he also become a tyrant? Would he make their children  slaves and take the best of their flocks and herds and wheat and oil,  leaving them in poverty while he lived in luxury? There were many who  thought so. The prophet Samuel, himself Saul's friend, warned them of  the danger although he helped to make Saul king. But the danger from  the Philistines was so great and they had suffered so much from their  enemies on account of their lack of unity that they were willing to  take the risk of organizing themselves as a kingdom under Saul.    =The first victories over the Philistines.=--Soon there came a summons  to battle. The first encounter turned out well for the Hebrews. One of  Saul's sons named Jonathan was especially brave and skillful as a  leader, and was much loved by the people. Other victories followed.  More and more clans and tribes flocked to Saul's standard. A young man  from Judah, named David, became famous as a captain and was made the  chief commander of Saul's armies. The Philistines were not driven out  from their forts, but they were held in check and the sky seemed  brighter. There was a chance now for victory and peace. Everyone was  hopeful for better things. When the soldiers came back from fighting  the Philistines, the women would go to meet them with songs and  dances. One of their songs ran like this:        =\"Saul has slain his thousands      And David his ten thousands.\"=    =Saul's jealousy.=--When Saul heard of this couplet he was jealous.  \"They gave more glory to David than to me,\" he thought. \"One of these  days, they will make him king in my place.\" His son Jonathan did not  share his fears. He loved and trusted David. But from that time  forward Saul hated David, and finally drove him out as a fugitive.  Instead of fighting the Philistines he spent all his strength chasing  David from town to town and from cave to cave. Of course the  Philistines took advantage of this quarrel between the two ablest men  among their foes and came back with a strong counter attack. Saul's  own life was forfeited and that of Jonathan also in a disastrous  defeat. The Philistines were masters once more. Saul's kingdom also  had proved for the most part a failure.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Locate on the map the Midianites and the Philistines.    2. Why would it have been a calamity for the world if the Philistines  had conquered the Hebrews?    3. Study carefully the parable of Jotham (Judges 9. 8-15). In the  light of this shrewd illustration, why is it hard to get _good_ men to  run for political office, even to-day?    4. If we should undertake to have an _entirely different kind_ of  mayors, aldermen, governors, Presidents and so on, perhaps really good  men would accept these offices. What kind?          CHAPTER XIII    THE NATION UNDER DAVID AND SOLOMON      After Saul's death his son Ishbaal fled across the Jordan where the  Philistines were not yet in control, and was accepted as king by the  East Jordan tribes. More and more, however, the hearts of all the  Hebrews turned toward the young David, who, under the Philistines, to  whom he paid tribute, now became king over the tribe of Judah in the  south.      DAVID AS A LEADER    David was a born leader. Physically he was an athlete. With his sling  he could throw stones straight, as Goliath, the Philistine giant,  discovered to his sorrow. He had the gift of winning friends, even  among those who might naturally have been his enemies, for example  Jonathan and Michal, son and daughter of Saul, and Achish, the  Philistine king. His followers with few exceptions were deeply devoted  to him, risking their lives, sometimes, to gratify his slightest wish.  He was wise in his dealings with men, knowing when to be stern and  when to be lenient.    =The nation united under David.=--For a few years there was more or  less of war between the followers of David and the followers of  Ishbaal. David did not like this war. He had no heart for fighting his  own kinsmen, the people of the north. His method was to win them over  without conquest. His chief difficulty in this was to restrain his own  followers. Fighting always leads to more fighting. A bitter personal  feud flamed up between Joab, David's chief general, and Abner, who  was the real power in the other kingdom. David did not dare to punish  Joab, yet he plainly showed his displeasure. When finally Ishbaal  himself was murdered in his sleep, David put the assassins to death.     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+   | [Illustration: CANAANITE CHISEL (BRONZE)]                         |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: CANAANITE FILE]                                    |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: BRONZE HAMMERHEAD]                                 |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: VERY ANCIENT CANAANITE FLINT, FOR MAKING STONE     |   | KNIVES]                                                           |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: BONE AWL HANDLE]                                   |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: A FISH-HOOK]                                       |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: CANAANITE WHETSTONES]                              |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: CANAANITE OR HEBREW NAILS]                         |   |                                                                   |   | Cuts on this page used by permission of the Palestine Exploration |   | Fund.                                                             |   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+    By this policy he pleased the people, both in the north and in the  south. And after seven years of division the leading men of all the  tribes came to David at Hebron, in Judah his headquarters, and made  him king over the entire Hebrew nation, north, east, and south.    =David's victories.=--Soon after this David declared his independence  of the Philistines. War broke out and for a time it went against the  Hebrews. But in the end they were able to rally their resources under  their new leader, and inflicted two crushing defeats on their old  enemies, which made them instead of the Philistines once and for all  the masters of Canaan.    From the Philistines David turned against the other petty enemies who  had so often taken advantage of the weakness of the Hebrews. Already,  while a vassal of the Philistines, he had thoroughly punished the  Amalekites, in the deserts of the south; and now he gave the Ammonites  and Moabites and other enemies on the east a taste of Hebrew warfare.  Before many years passed they had all learned their lesson, and there  was peace in Canaan.      PROGRESS IN CIVILIZATION    During all those years when the Hebrews were fighting for existence  life in their little villages and towns had been anything but  pleasant. Not only was there constant danger from human enemies and  from famine, there was also a lack of the comforts and pleasures of  civilized life. There were no books to read, no musical instruments  to play on, and few opportunities for any kind of recreation. They had  only coarse, rough clothing to wear, and coarse, ugly furniture for  their homes.    =The development of commerce.=--Now that peace and security had been  achieved, David did much to make the daily lives of all his people  happier. One way was through commerce. The great merchants of those  days were the Phoenicians, the people of Tyre and Sidon, whose daring  sailors steered their ships into every harbor on the Mediterranean Sea  and even out upon the stormy Atlantic and up to the tin mines of  Britain.    Very wisely David made a treaty of friendship with Hiram, king of  Tyre, and as a result Phoenician artists and artisans came down to  Jerusalem and helped to beautify the city. Phoenician wares also began  to be peddled in all the towns of Canaan: fine linen fabrics, such as  the Hebrews did not know how to weave; beautiful jars and cups, such  as Hebrew potters had not learned to fashion; jewels of silver and  gold and precious stones, over which Hebrew maidens hovered with  longing eyes. Soon one could see that the homes in these little towns  of Judah and Benjamin and Ephraim were cleaner and better furnished,  and the people were more neatly dressed. Commerce of the right kind is  always a blessing.    =Education.=--Better than fine clothes and jewels and furniture are  the things that feed the mind. David himself was a skillful harpist,  and no doubt this helped to make harp-playing popular. On one occasion  the ark of Jehovah, the sacred chest which had been carried in the  desert, was brought up to Jerusalem. It was accompanied by a chorus of  singers and a band of instrumental players, \"with harps and lyres and  cymbals.\" In the worship of the temple at Jerusalem music from this  time on had an important place. And all up and down the land here and  there, one could hear in humble homes the tinkle of harp strings; and  boys and girls who liked music could learn to play.    If not in David's time, then very soon after, the first Hebrew history  books were written. These contained stories which had been handed down  from generation to generation; stories about the beginnings of things;  stories"]]]
