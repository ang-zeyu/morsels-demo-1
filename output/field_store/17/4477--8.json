[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],[0,"Three Years' War (#12)"],[1,"      On the 28th of March a council of war was held. The first business  transacted referred to disciplinary matters; the council then proceeded  to lay down the conditions under which the commandos were to operate. It  was decided that General De la Rey with his Transvaalers should remain  at Brandfort with certain Free State commandos under General Philip  Botha, and that the remaining troops, under my command, should withdraw  in the evening.    Great was the curiosity of the officers and burghers concerning our  movements, but no man learnt anything from me. I was determined that in  future my plans should be kept entirely secret. Experience had taught me  that whenever a commanding officer allows his intentions to become  public something is sure to go wrong, and I made up my mind to hold the  reins of discipline with a firmer hand.    It is, of course, true that scarcely anything could be done without the  free co-operation of the burghers. They joined the commando when they  wished, or, if they preferred it, stayed away. But now I intended that  the men who joined the commando should be under a far stricter  discipline than formerly, and success rewarded my efforts.    We left Brandfort on the same evening. My object was to surprise the  little garrison at Sanna's Post, which guarded the Bloemfontein Water  Works, and thus to cut off the supply of water from that town.    I started in the direction of Winburg, so as to throw every one off the  scent. On all sides one heard the question, \"Where are we really going?  What can we have to do at Winburg?\"    The following day I concealed my commando, and that evening some spies,  on whom I could rely, and who were aware of my secret intentions,  brought me all the information I required.    At this point I had a great deal of trouble with Commandant Vilonel. It  appeared that, notwithstanding the express interdiction of the council  of war, there were some thirty waggons, belonging to burghers from  Winburg who were under his orders. I reminded him of the decision to  which the council had come; but he replied that he did not wish his  burghers to have to undergo the hardship of travelling without waggons.  We started that evening, and, sure enough, there he was with his lumber  following behind us.    I gave him notice in writing the next morning that he must send back the  waggons that very night when we were on the march. This provoked from  him a written request that a war council should be summoned to revise  the decision come to at Kroonstad. I answered that I absolutely declined  to do any such thing.    In the course of that day I received a number of reports. I was informed  that General Olivier was driving General Broadwood from Ladybrand  towards Thaba'Nchu. A little later I heard from General Froneman and  Commandant Fourie how matters stood at Sanna's Post. I had disclosed my  plan to them, and sent them out to reconnoitre. There were--so they told  me--according to their estimation, about two hundred English troops  which were stationed in such and such positions.    I at once summoned Generals A.P. Cronje, J.B. Wessels, C.C. Froneman,  and Piet de Wet, and took council with them, telling them of my plans  and enjoining strict secrecy. I then gave orders that Commandant P.  Fourie and C. Nel, with their burghers, three hundred and fifty in  number, should proceed under my command to Koorn Spruit, and be there  before break of day.    [Illustration: SANNA'S POST.    FROM A SKETCH BY THE AUTHOR.]    We settled that Generals Cronje, Wessels, Froneman, and Piet De Wet  should proceed with the remaining burghers, numbering eleven hundred and  fifty, to the ridges east of the Modder River, right opposite Sanna's  Post. They were to take with them the guns, of which we had four or  five, and bombard Sanna's Post as soon as it was light.    The English, I expected, would retreat to Bloemfontein, and then from my  position in Koorn Spruit I should be able to decimate them as they  passed that ravine. I had sent a large number of burghers with the four  generals so that our force might be sufficiently strong to turn General  Broadwood, in case he should hear that there was fighting at Sanna's  Post and come up to reinforce the garrison.    Here again I had trouble with Commandant Vilonel. I had little time to  argue--the sun was already setting, and we had to be off at once. I had  declined to allow a single waggon to go with me, but the Commandant  declared that he would not abide by the decision of the council of war.  He also refused to allow his burghers to go into positions which he  himself had not reconnoitred. He asked that the attack should be  postponed until he had examined Sanna's Post through his telescope.    My patience was now at an end. I told Commandant Vilonel that he must  obey my orders, and that if he did not do so I should dismiss him,  unless he himself resigned. He preferred to resign. My secretary  procured paper, and the Commandant wrote out his resignation. I at once  gave him his dismissal, and felt that a weight had been taken off my  shoulders now that I was free from so wrong-headed an officer.    There was no time now for the burghers to elect a new Commandant in the  usual way. I therefore assembled the Winburg commando, and told them  that Vilonel had resigned, that an opportunity of choosing a substitute  should be given to them later on, but that in the meanwhile I should  appoint Veldtcornet Gert Van der Merve. Nobody had anything to say  against \"Gerie,\" who was a courageous and amiable man; and, after he had  given orders that the waggons should be sent home, we continued our  march.    I met some of my spies at a _rendezvous_ which I had given them on the  road to the Water Works, and learnt from them that the force under  General Broadwood had come that evening from the direction of Ladybrand  and now occupied Thaba'Nchu.    I had ordered my generals to take up positions opposite Sanna's Post and  east of the Modder River. I now left them and rode on to Koorn Spruit,  not knowing that General Broadwood had left Thaba'Nchu after nightfall  and had proceeded to the Water Works. My advance was made as quietly as  possible, and as soon as we reached Koorn Spruit I hid my burghers in  the ravine, placing some to the right and some to the left of the  drift[31] on the road from Thaba'Nchu and Sanna's Post to Bloemfontein.    As soon as it became light enough to see anything we discovered that  just above the spruit[32] stood a waggon, with some Kaffirs and a number  of sheep and cattle beside it. The Kaffirs told us that the waggon  belonged to one of the \"hands-uppers\" from Thaba'Nchu, and that they had  been ordered to get it down to Bloemfontein as quickly as possible and  to sell it to the English. The owner of the sheep and of the cattle,  they said, was with General Broadwood, whose troops had just arrived at  Sanna's Post.    The light grew brighter, and there, three thousand paces from us, was  Broadwood's huge force.    I had only three hundred and fifty men with me; the other generals, to  the east of the Modder River, had not more than eleven hundred and fifty  between them.    The numbers against us were overwhelming, but I resolved to stand my  ground; and, fortunately, the positions which I had chosen were much to  our advantage--there would be no difficulty in concealing my burghers  and their horses.    I ordered that every one should still remain hidden, even when our party  to the east of the Modder River began to shoot, and that not a round was  to be fired until I gave the command.    General Broadwood was preparing to strike camp. It was then that I told  my men to allow the British troops to get to close quarters and  \"hands-up\" them, without wasting a single bullet.    Then our guns began to fire.    The result was a scene of confusion. Towards us, over the brow of the  hill, came the waggons pell-mell, with a few carts moving rapidly in  front. When the first of these reached the spruit its occupants--a man  with a woman beside him--became aware that something was wrong.    I was standing at the top of the drift with Commandants Fourie and Nel.  I immediately ordered two of my adjutants to mount the cart and to sit  at the driver's side.    The other carts came one after the other into the drift, and I ordered  them to follow close behind the first cart, at the same time warning the  occupants that if they gave any signal to the enemy, they would be shot.    The carts were filled with English from Thaba'Nchu. I was very glad that  the women and children should thus reach a place of safety, before the  fighting began.    So speedily did the carts follow each other that the English had no  suspicion of what was occurring, and very shortly the soldiers began to  pour into the drift in the greatest disorder. As soon as they reached  the stream they were met by the cry of \"Hands up!\"    Directly they heard the words, a forest of hands rose in the air.    More troops quickly followed, and we had disarmed two hundred of them  before they had time to know what was happening. The discipline among  the burghers was fairly satisfactory until the disarming work began. If  my men had only been able to think for themselves, they would have  thrown the rifles on the bank as they came into their hands, and so  would have disarmed far more of the English than they succeeded in  doing. But, as it was, the burghers kept on asking:    \"Where shall I put this rifle, General? What have I to do with this  horse?\"    That the work should be delayed by this sort of thing sorely tried my  hasty temper.    Very soon the enemy in the rear discovered that there was something  wrong in the drift, for one of their officers suddenly gave orders that  the troops should fall back. But in the meantime, as I have already  stated, we had disarmed two hundred men; while, about a hundred paces  from us on the banks of the spruit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1881"],[0,"The Call of the Canyon (#12)"],[1," through a cedar forest toward a place  called Deep Lake.    Carley had not been able yet, during the several hours of their journey,  to take any pleasure in the scenery or in her mount. For in the first  place there was nothing to see but scrubby little gnarled cedars and  drab-looking rocks; and in the second this Indian pony she rode had  discovered she was not an adept horsewoman and had proceeded to take  advantage of the fact. It did not help Carley's predicament to remember  that Glenn had decidedly advised her against riding this particular  mustang. To be sure, Flo had approved of Carley's choice, and Mr.  Hutter, with a hearty laugh, had fallen in line: \"Shore. Let her ride  one of the broncs, if she wants.\" So this animal she bestrode must  have been a bronc, for it did not take him long to elicit from Carley a  muttered, \"I don't know what bronc means, but it sounds like this pony  acts.\"    Carley had inquired the animal's name from the young herder who had  saddled him for her.    \"Wal, I reckon he ain't got much of a name,\" replied the lad, with  a grin, as he scratched his head. \"For us boys always called him  Spillbeans.\"    \"Humph! What a beautiful cognomen!\" ejaculated Carley, \"But according to  Shakespeare any name will serve. I'll ride him or--or--\"    So far there had not really been any necessity for the completion of  that sentence. But five miles of riding up into the cedar forest had  convinced Carley that she might not have much farther to go. Spillbeans  had ambled along well enough until he reached level ground where a long  bleached grass waved in the wind. Here he manifested hunger, then a  contrary nature, next insubordination, and finally direct hostility.  Carley had urged, pulled, and commanded in vain. Then when she gave  Spillbeans a kick in the flank he jumped stiff legged, propelling her up  out of the saddle, and while she was descending he made the queer jump  again, coming up to meet her. The jolt she got seemed to dislocate every  bone in her body. Likewise it hurt. Moreover, along with her idea of  what a spectacle she must have presented, it quickly decided Carley that  Spillbeans was a horse that was not to be opposed. Whenever he wanted a  mouthful of grass he stopped to get it. Therefore Carley was always  in the rear, a fact which in itself did not displease her. Despite  his contrariness, however, Spillbeans had apparently no intention of  allowing the other horses to get completely out of sight.    Several times Flo waited for Carley to catch up. \"He's loafing on you,  Carley. You ought to have on a spur. Break off a switch and beat him  some.\" Then she whipped the mustang across the flank with her bridle  rein, which punishment caused Spillbeans meekly to trot on with  alacrity. Carley had a positive belief that he would not do it for her.  And after Flo's repeated efforts, assisted by chastisement from Glenn,  had kept Spillbeans in a trot for a couple of miles Carley began to  discover that the trotting of a horse was the most uncomfortable motion  possible to imagine. It grew worse. It became painful. It gradually got  unendurable. But pride made Carley endure it until suddenly she thought  she had been stabbed in the side. This strange piercing pain must  be what Glenn had called a \"stitch\" in the side, something common to  novices on horseback. Carley could have screamed. She pulled the mustang  to a walk and sagged in her saddle until the pain subsided. What a  blessed relief! Carley had keen sense of the difference between riding  in Central Park and in Arizona. She regretted her choice of horses.  Spillbeans was attractive to look at, but the pleasure of riding him  was a delusion. Flo had said his gait resembled the motion of a rocking  chair. This Western girl, according to Charley, the sheep herder, was  not above playing Arizona jokes. Be that as it might, Spillbeans now  manifested a desire to remain with the other horses, and he broke out of  a walk into a trot. Carley could not keep him from trotting. Hence her  state soon wore into acute distress.    Her left ankle seemed broken. The stirrup was heavy, and as soon as she  was tired she could no longer keep its weight from drawing her foot in.  The inside of her right knee was as sore as a boil. Besides, she had  other pains, just as severe, and she stood momentarily in mortal dread  of that terrible stitch in her side. If it returned she knew she would  fall off. But, fortunately, just when she was growing weak and dizzy,  the horses ahead slowed to a walk on a descent. The road wound down into  a wide deep canyon. Carley had a respite from her severest pains. Never  before had she known what it meant to be so grateful for relief from  anything.    The afternoon grew far advanced and the sunset was hazily shrouded in  gray. Hutter did not like the looks of those clouds. \"Reckon we're in  for weather,\" he said. Carley did not care what happened. Weather or  anything else that might make it possible to get off her horse! Glenn  rode beside her, inquiring solicitously as to her pleasure. \"Ride of  my life!\" she lied heroically. And it helped some to see that she both  fooled and pleased him.    Beyond the canyon the cedared desert heaved higher and changed its  aspect. The trees grew larger, bushier, greener, and closer together,  with patches of bleached grass between, and russet-lichened rocks  everywhere. Small cactus plants bristled sparsely in open places;  and here and there bright red flowers--Indian paintbrush, Flo called  them--added a touch of color to the gray. Glenn pointed to where dark  banks of cloud had massed around the mountain peaks. The scene to the  west was somber and compelling.    At last the men and the pack-horses ahead came to a halt in a level  green forestland with no high trees. Far ahead a chain of soft gray  round hills led up to the dark heaved mass of mountains. Carley saw the  gleam of water through the trees. Probably her mustang saw or scented  it, because he started to trot. Carley had reached a limit of strength,  endurance, and patience. She hauled him up short. When Spillbeans  evinced a stubborn intention to go on Carley gave him a kick. Then it  happened.    She felt the reins jerked out of her hands and the saddle propel her  upward. When she descended it was to meet that before-experienced jolt.    \"Look!\" cried Flo. \"That bronc is going to pitch.\"    \"Hold on, Carley!\" yelled Glenn.    Desperately Carley essayed to do just that. But Spillbeans jolted her  out of the saddle. She came down on his rump and began to slide back and  down. Frightened and furious, Carley tried to hang to the saddle with  her hands and to squeeze the mustang with her knees. But another jolt  broke her hold, and then, helpless and bewildered, with her heart in  her throat and a terrible sensation of weakness, she slid back at each  upheave of the muscular rump until she slid off and to the ground in a  heap. Whereupon Spillbeans trotted off toward the water.    Carley sat up before Glenn and Flo reached her. Manifestly they were  concerned about her, but both were ready to burst with laughter. Carley  knew she was not hurt and she was so glad to be off the mustang that, on  the moment, she could almost have laughed herself.    \"That beast is well named,\" she said. \"He spilled me, all right. And I  presume I resembled a sack of beans.\"    \"Carley--you're--not hurt?\" asked Glenn, choking, as he helped her up.    \"Not physically. But my feelings are.\"    Then Glenn let out a hearty howl of mirth, which was seconded by a  loud guffaw from Hutter. Flo, however, appeared to be able to restrain  whatever she felt. To Carley she looked queer.    \"Pitch! You called it that,\" said Carley.    \"Oh, he didn't really pitch. He just humped up a few times,\" replied  Flo, and then when she saw how Carley was going to take it she burst  into a merry peal of laughter. Charley, the sheep herder was grinning,  and some of the other men turned away with shaking shoulders.    \"Laugh, you wild and woolly Westerners!\" ejaculated Carley. \"It must  have been funny. I hope I can be a good sport.... But I bet you I ride  him tomorrow.\"    \"Shore you will,\" replied Flo.    Evidently the little incident drew the party closer together. Carley  felt a warmth of good nature that overcame her first feeling of  humiliation. They expected such things from her, and she should expect  them, too, and take them, if not fearlessly or painlessly, at least  without resentment.    Carley walked about to ease her swollen and sore joints, and while doing  so she took stock of the camp ground and what was going on. At second  glance the place had a certain attraction difficult for her to define.  She could see far, and the view north toward those strange gray-colored  symmetrical hills was one that fascinated while it repelled her. Near at  hand the ground sloped down to a large rock-bound lake, perhaps a mile  in circumference. In the distance, along the shore she saw a white  conical tent, and blue smoke, and moving gray objects she took for  sheep.    The men unpacked and unsaddled the horses, and, hobbling their forefeet  together, turned them loose. Twilight had fallen and each man appeared  to be briskly set upon his own task. Glenn was cutting around the foot  of a thickly branched cedar where, he told Carley, he would make a bed  for her and Flo. All that Carley could see that could be used for such  purpose was a canvas-covered roll. Presently Glenn untied a rope from  round this, unrolled it, and dragged it under the cedar. Then he spread  down the outer layer of canvas, disclosing a considerable thickness  of blankets. From under the top of these he pulled out two flat little  pillows. These he placed in position, and turned back some of the  blankets.    \"Carley, you crawl in here, pile the blankets up, and the tarp over  them,\" directed Glenn. \"If it rains pull the tarp up over your head--and  let it rain.\"  "]]]
