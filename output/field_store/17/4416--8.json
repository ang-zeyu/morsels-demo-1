The  ancient capital no longer suited his present state as a conqueror; the  accommodation was too restricted, the decoration too poor, and probably  the number of apartments was insufficient to house the troops of women  and slaves brought back from his wars by its royal master. Built on  the very bank of the Tebilti, one of the tributaries of the Khusur,  and hemmed in by three temples, there was no possibility of its  enlargement--a difficulty which often occurs in ancient cities. The  necessary space for new buildings could only have been obtained by  altering the course of the stream, and sacrificing a large part of the  adjoining quarters of the city: Assur-nazir-pal therefore preferred to  abandon the place and to select a new site where he would have ample  space at his disposal.    [Illustration: 067.jpg THE MOUNDS OF CALAH]         Drawn by Boudier, from Layard. The pointed mound on the left       near the centre of the picture represents the ziggurat of       the great temple.    He found what he required close at hand in the half-ruined city of  Calah, where many of his most illustrious predecessors had in times past  sought refuge from the heat of Assur. It was now merely an obscure and  sleepy town about twelve miles south of Nineveh, on the right bank of  the Tigris, and almost at the angle made by the junction of this river  with the Greater Zab. The place contained a palace built by Shalmaneser  I., which, owing to many years' neglect, had become uninhabitable.  Assur-nazir-pal not only razed to the ground the palaces and temples,  but also levelled the mound on which they had been built; he then  cleared away the soil down to the water level, and threw up an immense  and almost rectangular terrace on which to lay out his new buildings.    [Illustration: 068.jpg STELE OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL AT CALAH]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Mansell.    The king chose Ninip, the god of war, as the patron of the city, and  dedicated to him, at the north-west corner of the terrace, a ziggurat  with its usual temple precincts. Here the god was represented as a bull  with a man's head and bust in gilded alabaster, and two yearly feasts  were instituted in his honour, one in the month Sebat, the other in the  month Ulul. The ziggurat was a little over two hundred feet high,  and was probably built in seven stages, of which only one now remains  intact: around it are found several independent series of chambers and  passages, which may have been parts of other temples, but it is now  impossible to say which belonged to the local Belit, which to Sin, to  Gula, to Ramman, or to the ancient deity Ra. At the entrance to the  largest chamber, on a rectangular pedestal, stood a stele with rounded  top, after the Egyptian fashion. On it is depicted a figure of the king,  standing erect and facing to the left of the spectator; he holds his  mace at his side, his right hand is raised in the attitude of adoration,  and above him, on the left upper edge of the stele, are grouped the five  signs of the planets; at the base of the stele stands an altar with  a triangular pedestal and circular slab ready for the offerings to be  presented to the royal founder by priests or people. The palace extended  along the south side of the terrace facing the town, and with the river  in its rear; it covered a space one hundred and thirty-one yards in  length and a hundred and nine in breadth. In the centre was a large  court, surrounded by seven or eight spacious halls, appropriated  to state functions; between these and the court were many rooms of  different sizes, forming the offices and private apartments of the  royal house. The whole palace was built of brick faced with stone. Three  gateways, flanked by winged, human-headed bulls, afforded access to the  largest apartment, the hall of audience, where the king received his  subjects or the envoys of foreign powers.* The doorways and walls of  some of the rooms were decorated with glazed tiles, but the majority of  them were covered with bands of coloured** bas-reliefs which portrayed  various episodes in the life of the king--his state-councils, his lion  hunts, the reception of tribute, marches over mountains and rivers,  chariot-skirmishes, sieges, and the torture and carrying away of  captives.         * At the east end of the hall Layard found a block of       alabaster covered with inscriptions, forming a sort of       platform on which the king's throne may have stood.         ** Layard points out the traces of colouring still visible       when the excavations were made.    [Illustration: 070.jpg THE WINGED BULLS OP ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Layard.    Incised in bands across these pictures are inscriptions extolling the  omnipotence of Assur, while at intervals genii with eagles' beaks, or  deities in human form, imperious and fierce, appear with hands full  of offerings, or in the act of brandishing thunderbolts against evil  spirits. The architect who designed this imposing decoration, and the  sculptors who executed it, closely followed the traditions of ancient  Chaldaea in the drawing and composition of their designs, and in the use  of colour or chisel; but the qualities and defects peculiar to their own  race give a certain character of originality to this borrowed art. They  exaggerated the stern and athletic aspect of their models, making the  figure thick-set, the muscles extraordinarily enlarged, and the features  ludicrously accentuated.    [Illustration: 071.jpg GLAZED TILE FROM PALACE OF CALAH]         Drawn by Boudier, after Layard.    Their pictures produce an impression of awkwardness, confusion and  heaviness, but the detail is so minute and the animation so great that  the attention of the spectator is forcibly arrested; these uncouth  beings impress us with the sense of their self-reliance and their  confidence in their master, as we watch them brandishing their  weapons or hurrying to the attack, and see the shock of battle and the  death-blows given and received. The human-headed bulls, standing on  guard at the gates, exhibit the calm and pensive dignity befitting  creatures conscious of their strength, while the lions passant who  sometimes replace them, snarl and show their teeth with an almost  alarming ferocity.    [Illustration: 072.jpg LION FROM ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL'S PALACE]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph of the sculpture in the       British Museum.    The statues of men and gods, as a rule, are lacking in originality. The  heavy robes which drape them from head to foot give them the appearance  of cylinders tied in at the centre and slightly flattened towards the  top. The head surmounting this shapeless bundle is the only life-like  part, and even the lower half of this is rendered heavy by the hair  and beard, whose tightly curled tresses lie in stiff rows one above the  other. The upper part of the face which alone is visible is  correctly drawn; the expression is of rather a commonplace type of  nobility--respectable but self-sufficient. The features--eyes, forehead,  nose, mouth--are all those of Assur-nazir-pal; the hair is arranged in  the fashion he affected, and the robe is embroidered with his jewels;  but amid all this we miss the keen intelligence always present in  Egyptian sculpture, whether under the royal head-dress of Cheops or in  the expectant eyes of the sitting scribe: the Assyrian sculptor could  copy the general outline of his model fairly well, but could not infuse  soul into the face of the conqueror, whose \"countenance beamed above the  destruction around him.\"    The water of the Tigris being muddy, and unpleasant to the taste, and  the wells at Calah so charged with lime and bitumen as to render them  unwholesome, Assur-nazir-pal supplied the city with water from the  neighbouring Zab.* An abundant stream was diverted from this river at  the spot now called Negub, and conveyed at first by a tunnel excavated  in the rock, and thence by an open canal to the foot of the great  terrace: at this point the flow of the water was regulated by dams, and  the surplus was utilised for irrigation** purposes by means of openings  cut in the banks.         * The presence of bitumen in the waters of Calah is due to       the hot springs which rise in the bed of the brook Shor-       derreh.         ** The canal of Negub--_Negub_ signifies _hole_ in Arabic--       was discovered by Layard. The Zab having changed its course       to the south, and scooped out a deeper bed for itself, the       double arch, which serves as an entrance to the canal, is       actually above the ordinary level of the river, and the       water flows through it only in flood-time.    The aqueduct was named Babilat-khigal--the bringer of plenty--and, to  justify the epithet, date-palms, vines, and many kinds of fruit trees  were planted along its course, so that both banks soon assumed the  appearance of a shady orchard interspersed with small towns and villas.  The population rapidly increased, partly through the spontaneous  influx of Assyrians themselves, but still more through the repeated  introduction of bands of foreign prisoners: forts, established at the  fords of the Zab, or commanding the roads which cross the Gebel Makhlub,  kept the country in subjection and formed an inner line of defence at a  short distance from the capital.

The masses of infantry seem actually in motion, a troop of horsemen rush  blindly over uneven ground, and the episodes of their raid are unfolded  in all their confusion with unfailing animation.    [Illustration: 073.jpg AN ASSYRIAN CAVALRY RAID THROUGH THE WOODS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.    For the first time a spectator can realise Assyrian warfare with its  striking contrasts of bravery and unbridled cruelty; he is no longer  reduced to spell out laboriously a monotonous narrative of a battle, for  the battle takes place actually before his eyes. And after the return  from the scene of action, when it is desired to show how the victor  employed his prisoners for the greater honour of his gods and his own  glory, the picture is no less detailed and realistic.    [Illustration: 074.jpg (and 75) TRANSPORT OF A WINGED BULL ON A SLEDGE.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.    There we see them, the noble and the great of all the conquered nations,  Chaldaeans and Elamites, inhabitants of Cilicia, Phoenicia, and Judaea,  harnessed to ropes and goaded by the whips of the overseers, dragging  the colossal bull which is destined to mount guard at the gates of the  palace: with bodies bent, pendant arms, and faces contorted with pain,  they, who had been the chief men in their cities, now take the place of  beasts of burden, while Sennacherib, erect on his state chariot, with  steady glance and lips compressed, watches them as they pass slowly  before him in their ignominy and misery.    After the destruction of Babylon there is a pause in the history of  the conqueror, and with him in that of Assyria itself. It seems as  if Nineveh had been exhausted by the greatness of her effort, and  was stopping to take breath before setting out on a fresh career of  conquest: the other nations also, as if overwhelmed by the magnitude  of the catastrophe, appear to have henceforth despaired of their own  security, and sought only how to avoid whatever might rouse against them  the enmity of the master of the hour. His empire formed a compact and  solid block in their midst, on which no human force seemed capable of  making any impression. They had attacked it each in turn, or all at  once, Elam in the east, Urartu in the north, Egypt in the south-west,  and their efforts had not only miserably failed, but had for the most  part drawn down upon them disastrous reprisals. The people of Urartu  remained in gloomy inaction amidst their mountains, the Elamites had  lost their supremacy over half the Aramaean tribes, and if Egypt was as  yet inaccessible beyond the intervening deserts, she owed it less to the  strength of her armies than to the mysterious fatality at Libnah. In one  half-century the Assyrians had effectually and permanently disabled  the first of these kingdoms, and inflicted on the others such serious  injuries that they were slow in recovering from them. The fate of these  proud nations had intimidated the inferior states--Arabs, Medes, tribes  of Asia Minor, barbarous Cimmerians or Scythians,--all alike were  careful to repress their natural inclinations to rapine and plunder. If  occasionally their love of booty overpowered their prudence, and they  hazarded a raid on some defenceless village in the neighbouring border  territory, troops were hastily despatched from the nearest Assyrian  garrison, who speedily drove them back across the frontier, and pursuing  them into their own country, inflicted on them so severe a punishment  that they remained for some considerable time paralysed by awe and  terror. Assyria was the foremost kingdom of the East, and indeed of the  whole world, and the hegemony which she exercised over all the countries  within her reach cannot be accounted for solely by her military  superiority. Not only did she excel in the art of conquest, as many  before her had done--Babylonians, Elamites, Hittites, and Egyptians--but  she did what none of them had been able to accomplish; she exacted  lasting obedience from the conquered nations, ruling them with a firm  hand, and accustoming them to live on good terms with one another in  spite of diversity of race, and this with a light rein, with unfailing  tact, and apparently with but little effort. The system of deportation  so resolutely carried out by Tiglath-pileser III. and Sargon began to  produce effect, and up to this time the most happy results only were  discernible. The colonies which had been planted throughout the empire  from Palestine to Media, some of them two generations previously, others  within recent years, were becoming more and more acclimatised to their  new surroundings, on which they were producing the effect desired by  their conquerors; they were meant to hold in check the populations in  whose midst they had been set down, to act as a curb upon them, and also  to break up their national unity and thus gradually prepare them for  absorption into a wider fatherland, in which they would cease to be  exclusively Damascenes, Samaritans, Hittites, or Aramaeans, since they  would become Assyrians and fellow-citizens of a mighty empire. The  provinces, brought at length under a regular system of government,  protected against external dangers and internal discord, by a  well-disciplined soldiery, and enjoying a peace and security they  had rarely known in the days of their independence, gradually became  accustomed to live in concord under the rule of a common sovereign, and  to feel themselves portions of a single empire. The speech of Assyria  was their official language, the gods of Assyria were associated with  their national gods in the prayers they offered up for the welfare of  the sovereign, and foreign nations with whom they were brought into  communication no longer distinguished between them and their conquerors,  calling their country Assyria, and regarding its inhabitants as  Assyrians. As is invariably the case, domestic peace and good  administration had caused a sudden development of wealth and commercial  activity. Although Nineveh and Calah never became such centres of trade  and industry as Babylon had been, yet the presence of the court and the  sovereign attracted thither merchants from all parts of the world.    [Illustration: 079.jpg SENNACHERIB]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.    The Medes, reaching the capital by way of the passes of Kowandiz and  Suleimaniyeh, brought in the lapis-lazuli, precious stones, metals,  and woollen stuffs of Central Asia and the farthest East, while  the Phoenicians and even Greeks, who were already following in their  foot steps, came thither to sell in the a bazaars of Assyria the most  precious of the wares brought back by their merchant vessels from the  shores of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and the farthest West. The  great cities of the triangle of Assyria were gradually supplanting all  the capitals of the ancient world, not excepting Memphis, and becoming  the centres of universal trade; unexcelled for centuries in the arts of  war, Assyria was in a fair way to become mistress also in the arts of  peace. A Jewish prophet thus described the empire at a later date: \"The  Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing  shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick clouds.  The waters nourished him, the deep made him grow: therefore his stature  was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were  multiplied, and his branches became long by reason of many waters, when  he shot them forth. All the fowls of the heaven made their nests in his  boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring  forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. Thus  was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his  root was by many waters. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide  him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the plane trees were  not as his branches; nor was any tree like unto him in beauty: so that  all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.\"  (Ezek. xxxi. 3-9).
