Mr. Henry James would  no doubt have preferred this phenomenon as the basis of a plot to the  preposterous mesmerism which forms the plot of _Trilby_, he being one of  the few who understand that a dramatic situation is a mental experience.  In _Peter Ibbetson_ the \"dreaming truly\"--the illusion that becomes as  great as reality--is the phenomenon the author examines. \"Dreaming  truly\" is like the ecstasy of the saints: it is the \"will to believe\" in  the very act of willing.    Du Maurier was spoilt for romance by his long connection with a comic  paper. It had become a habit with him to be on his guard against  everything that could be travestied. This was the conventional side of  du Maurier in evidence, as it is also in that other flaw in the simple  story of _Trilby_--the adulation of worldly success. We find him  constantly writing in this strain in the description of character: \"He  is now one of the greatest artists in the world, and Europeans cross the  Atlantic to consult him\"; or of another character: \"And now that his  name is a household word in two hemispheres\"; and of another: \"Whose  pinnacle (of pure unadulterated fame) is now the highest of all,\" &c.    [Illustration]      Section 3    In all his books the author shows some of that response to old-time  associations which gives to authors like Dumas and Scott their freedom  from things that only belong to the present moment--precisely the  things, by the way, which do not last beyond the present. The  consciousness that the experiences of life to be valued are the ones  which unite us to those who preceded us in life, and which will in turn  give us a share in the future, is in the possession of the Romantic  school. But du Maurier seems to have felt himself paid to be funny, and  to conceal his sense of romance as Jack Point concealed his  love-sickness. His master, Thackeray, less than anyone apologised to his  readers for the parade of his own feelings.    There is a note of smugness that spoils _Trilby_; in fact Little Billee,  \"frock-coated, shirt-collared within an inch of his life, duly scarfed  and scarf-pinned, chimney-pot-hatted, most beautifully trousered, and  balmorally booted,\" is the most insufferable picture of a hero of a  romance. This person compromises the effect of the charmingly haunting  presence of Trilby herself, and of the great-hearted gentleman in  Taffy. There is, moreover, the failure to convince us of Little Billee's  genius. We are not assisted to belief in the immortality of his works,  by the illustrations of the mid-Victorian upholstery in the midst of  which they were manufactured. On the other hand, we merely have a vision  of the type of art which won popular success a generation ago,  encouraged by the Royal Academy at the expense of something better, and  keeping a large group of well-dressed painters so much in Society, that,  like Little Billee himself, they actually grew tired of the great before  the great had time to tire of them--\"incredible as it may seem, and  against nature.\"    Du Maurier put portraits of his friends into _Trilby_, softening the  outlines, and giving the touches, legitimate in a work of art, which  promote variation. He wrote impulsively, and a spirit of generous  recognition of the achievements of all his friends almost ruined his  book. The \"lived happy ever afterwards\" sentiment follows up every  reference to them. In the famous character of \"Joe Sibley\"  (Whistler)--afterwards altered to Antony, a Swiss, and ruined--a witty,  a debonair and careless genius was created. Just such an impression was  made upon us by this character as Whistler's own studied butterfly-pose  in life seemed intended to make. It was with the greatest regret we  missed the fascinating figure from the novel when published in book  form, a regret even confessed to by Whistler himself, though he had not  been able to refrain from dashing into print over its publication. There  was none other of the Bohemians described that so endeared himself to  us, or that was so alive--witnessing to the degree to which Whistler's  personality affected those with whom he was thrown in contact. Du  Maurier represented a character in Sibley with the defects of his  qualities, to the greater emphasis of the qualities. To attribute to a  man the genius to be king of Bohemia, and to receive from everyone  forgiveness for everything, _a cause de ses gentillesses_ to make him  witty also, and a most exquisite and original artist--this would have  been enough for most men, though it was not enough for Whistler. Joe  Sibley, not Little Billee, is the real creation of \"an artist\" that is  in the book.      Section 4    When _Trilby_ was put on the English stage a girl to play the heroine's  part had to be found. That was the first problem. And speaking of the  fact that a _Trilby_ did appear almost immediately, du Maurier said,  \"There is a school which believes that wherever Art leads Nature is  bound to follow. I ought to belong to it, if there is.\" A _Trilby_ was  heard of; more, du Maurier had often commented upon the beauty of the  lady when she was a child living near him at Hampstead Heath. He  inquired her name. She was already on the stage, and showing promise as  an actress. He still felt sceptical, we are told, and so a photograph  was sent. He said, \"No acting will be wanted; for here is Trilby.\" Miss  Baird was interviewed. \"In face and manner,\" said du Maurier, telling  the story of the interview, \"she seemed still more Trilby-like than  ever; but Mr. Tree, who was present, was on thoughts of acting-power  intent. And when he gravely announced that to be an actress a woman  should not be well-born and well-bred, and that if possible she should  have had her home in the wings or the gutter, I considered the matter  settled. We drove away in silence, and I, at any rate, in gloom. For  Miss Baird, refined and gentle, and well-born and well-bred, was still  Trilby for me, and I flatly refused to see either of the ladies whom Mr.  Tree had in mind. Finally, he thought he would see Miss Baird again, and  with her read over a scene or two. He got another cab--returned there  and then--in forty-eight hours the engagement was made.\"    [Illustration: Illustration for \"Esmond\"]    It may be found interesting if we revive here a criticism which throws  light on the first reception of the adaption of _Trilby_ for the stage.  The play was put on before the _Trilby_ boom had spent itself, but  critics would, from the nature of their species, be rather prejudiced  against, than carried away in favour of, anything which came in with a  \"boom\" that was not of their own making. There was a criticism written  of the play at the time by Mr. Justin Huntly Macarthy which, quoted,  will give us the history of the \"boom.\" It was his good fortune to be in  the United States \"when,\" he says, \"the taste for _Trilby_ became a  passion, when the passion grew into a mania and the mania deepened into  a madness,\" and he noted that in England the play and not the novel  kindled the passion; though in the criticism of the novel, classed as it  had been even in this country with the work of Thackeray, he could only  recall one note of dispraise, \"so earnest and scornful that, in its  loneliness, it seemed to fall like the clatter of a steel glove in a  house of prayer.\" He recalled a friend of his goaded to ferocity by  another's exuberance of rapture for some latter-day singers, crying out  \"Hang your Decadents! Humpty-Dumpty is worth all they ever wrote.\"  \"This,\" he continued, \"is a variety of the mood which accepts _Trilby_.  In _Trilby_ we get back, as it were, to Humpty-Dumpty--to its simplicity  at least, if not to its pitch of art. The strong man and the odd man and  the boy man, brothers in Bohemianism, brothers in art, brothers  in love for youth and beauty; the girl, the fair, the kind, the  for-ever-desirable, pure in impurity, and sacred even in shame; the dingy  evil genius who gibbers in Yiddish to the God he denies; the hopeless,  devoted musician, whose spirit in a previous existence answered to the  name of Bowes; the mother who makes the appeal that so many parents have  made on behalf of their sons to fair sinners since the days when Duval  the elder interviewed Marguerite Gauthier; all this company of puppets  please in their familiarity, their straightforwardness, their undefeated  obviousness, very much as a game of bowls on a village green with decent  rustics, or a game of romps in a rose-garden with laughing children,  might please after a supper with Nana or an evening with the  Theosophists.\"    This seems to us to diagnose the case as far as the success of the play  was concerned. But as regards the book at which it was partly aimed, it  is wide of the mark. There is something in a work of fiction when it is  of sufficient power to make a success simply as fiction which cannot be  carried over the footlights. If we only knew Shakespeare through seeing  him acted we should rate him much lower than we do. The success of  Shakespeare upon the stage rests with certain qualities that can only  properly tell upon the stage. But great as these qualities are, in  Shakespeare's case they far from represent his whole art; there remains  unexpressed the fragrance of field and flower, the secrets of mood,  which do not lie with facts that acting can express, and which float  like a perfume between us and the pages. All this the dust of stage  carpentry destroys, and the unnaturalness of lime-light dispels. The  charm in _Trilby_ is overlaid by the obvious, but the charm is there  for the reader, just as the obviousness is there for the stage when the  charm is gone in the adaptation. The stage is the throne of the obvious.  It is possible for art to be obvious and great, as the art of Turner was  in painting. His art was theatrical. It is the obvious that is  theatrical.

This was the  case as regards the sanctuaries erected by Amenhotep III. in the island of  Elephantine, which were figured by the members of the French expedition at  the end of the last century, and destroyed by the Turkish governor of Asuan  in 1822. The best preserved, namely, the south temple (fig. 75), consisted  of but a single chamber of sandstone, 14 feet high, 31 feet wide, and 39  feet long. The walls, which were straight, and crowned with the usual  cornice, rested on a platform of masonry some 8 feet above the ground. This  platform was surrounded by a parapet wall, breast high. All around the  temple ran a colonnade, the sides each consisting of seven square pillars,  without capital or base, and the two facades, front and back, being  supported by two columns with the lotus-bud capital. Both pillars and  columns rose direct from the parapet; except on the east front, where a  flight of ten or twelve steps, enclosed between two walls of the same  height as the platform, led up to the _cella_. The two columns at the head  of the steps were wider apart than those of the opposite face, and through  the space thus opened was seen a richly-decorated door. A second door  opened at the other end, beneath the portico. Later, in Roman times, this  feature was utilised in altering the building. The inter-columnar space at  the end was filled up, and thus was obtained a second hall, rough and bare,  but useful for the purposes of the temple service. These Elephantine  sanctuaries bring to mind the peripteral temples of the Greeks, and this  resemblance to one of the most familiar forms of classical architecture  explains perhaps the boundless admiration with which they were regarded by  the French savants. Those of Mesheikh, of El Kab, and of Sharonah are  somewhat more elaborate. The building at El Kab is in three divisions (fig.  76); first, a hall of four columns (A); next, a chamber (B) supported by  four Hathor-headed pillars; and in the end wall, opposite the door, a niche  (C), approached by four steps. Of these small oratories the most complete  model now remaining belongs to the Ptolemaic period; namely, the temple of  Hathor at Deir el Medineh (fig. 77). Its length is just double its breadth.  The walls are built with a batter inclining inwards,[17] and are externally  bare, save at the door, which is framed in a projecting border covered with  finely-sculptured scenes. The interior is in three parts: A portico (B),  supported by two lotus flower columns; a pronaos (C), reached by a flight  of four steps, and separated from the portico by a wall which connects the  two lotus flower columns with two Hathor-headed pilasters _in antis_;  lastly, the sanctuary (D), flanked by two small chambers (E, E), which are  lighted by square openings cut in the ceiling. The ascent to the terrace is  by way of a staircase, very ingeniously placed in the south corner of the  portico, and furnished with a beautiful open window (F). This is merely a  temple in miniature; but the parts, though small, are so well proportioned  that it would be impossible to conceive anything more delicate or graceful.    [Illustration: Fig. 77.--Plan of temple of Hathor, Deir el Medineh.]    [Illustration: Fig. 78.--Plan of temple of Khonsu, Karnak.]    [Illustration: Fig. 79.--Pylon, with masts, from a bas-relief in the temple  of Khonsu at Karnak.]    [Illustration: Fig. 80.--The Ramesseum restored, to show the rising of the  ground.]    [Illustration: Fig. 81.--Crypts in the thickness of the walls, round the  sanctuary at Denderah.]    [Illustration: Fig. 82.--The pronaos of Edfu, as seen from the top of the  eastern pylon.]    We cannot say as much for the temple which the Pharaohs of the Twentieth  Dynasty erected to the south of Karnak, in honour of the god Khonsu (fig.  78); but if the style is not irreproachable, the plan is nevertheless so  clear, that one is tempted to accept it as the type of an Egyptian temple,  in preference to others more elegant or majestic. On analysis, it resolves  itself into two parts separated by a thick wall (A, A). In the centre of  the lesser division is the Holy of Holies (B), open at both ends and  isolated from the rest of the building by a surrounding passage (C) 10  feet in width. To the right and left of this sanctuary are small dark  chambers (D, D), and behind it is a hall of four columns (E), from which  open seven other chambers (F, F). Such was the house of the god, having no  communication with the adjoining parts, except by two doors (G) in the  southern wall (A, A). These opened into a wide and shallow hypostyle hall  (H), divided into nave and aisles. The nave is supported by four lotus-  flower columns, 23 feet in height; the aisles each contain two lotus-bud  columns 18 feet high. The roof of the nave is, therefore, 5 feet higher  than that of the sides. This elevation was made use of for lighting  purposes, the clerestory being fitted with stone gratings, which admitted  the daylight. The court (I) was square, and surrounded by a double  colonnade entered by way of four side-gates and a great central gateway  flanked by two quadrangular towers with sloping fronts. This pylon (K)  measures 105 feet in length, 33 feet in width, and 60 feet in height. It  contains no chambers, but only a narrow staircase, which leads to the top  of the gate, and thence up to the towers. Four long grooves in the facade,  reaching to a third of its height, correspond to four quadrangular openings  cut through. the whole thickness of the masonry. Here were fixed four  great wooden masts, formed of joined beams and held in place by a wooden  framework fixed in the four openings above mentioned. From these masts  floated long streamers of various colours (fig. 79). Such was the temple of  Khonsu, and such, in their main features, were the majority of the greater  temples of Theban and Ptolemaic times, as Luxor, the Ramesseum, Medinet  Habu, Edfu, and Denderah. Though for the most part half in ruins, they  affect one with a strange and disquieting sense of oppression. As mystery  was a favourite attribute of the Egyptian gods, even so the plan of their  temples is in such wise devised as to lead gradually from the full sunshine  of the outer world to the obscurity of their retreats. At the entrance we  find large open spaces, where air and light stream freely in. The hypostyle  hall is pervaded by a sober twilight; the sanctuary is more than half lost  in a vague darkness; and at the end of the building, in the farthest of the  chambers, night all but reigns completely. The effect of distance which was  produced by this gradual diminution of light, was still further heightened  by various structural artifices. The parts, for instance, are not on the  same level. The ground rises from the entrance (fig. 80), and there are  always a few steps to mount in passing from one part to another. In the  temple of Khonsu the difference of level is not more than 5-1/4 feet, but  it is combined with a lowering of the roof, which in most cases is very  strongly marked. From the pylon to the wall at the farther end, the height  decreases continuously. The peristyle is loftier than the hypostyle hall,  and the hypostyle hall is loftier than the sanctuary. The last hall of  columns and the farthest chamber are lower and lower still. The architects  of Ptolemaic times changed certain details of arrangement. They erected  chapels and oratories on the terraced roofs, and reserved space for the  construction of secret passages and crypts in the thickness of the walls,  wherein to hide the treasure of the god (fig. 81). They, however,  introduced only two important modifications of the original plan. The  sanctuary was formerly entered by two opposite doors; they left but one.  Also the colonnade, which was originally continued round the upper end of  the court, or, where there was no court, along the facade of the temple,  became now the pronaos, so forming an additional chamber. The columns of  the outer row are retained, but built into a wall reaching to about half  their height. This connecting wall is surmounted by a cornice, which thus  forms a screen, and so prevented the outer throng from seeing what took  place within (fig. 82). The pronaos is supported by two, three, or even  four rows of columns, according to the size of the edifice. For the rest,  it is useful to compare the plan of the temple of Edfu (fig. 83) with that  of the temple of Khonsu, observing how little they differ the one from the  other.    [Illustration: Fig. 83.--Plan of temple, Edfu.]    [Illustration: Fig. 84.--Plan of the temple of Karnak in the reign of  Amenhotep III.]    [Illustration: Fig. 85.--Plan of Hypostyle Hall, Karnak.]    [Illustration: Fig. 86.--Plan of great temple, Luxor.]    [Illustration: Fig. 87.--Plan of the Isle of Philae.]    Thus designed, the building sufficed for all the needs of worship. If  enlargement was needed, the sanctuary and surrounding chambers were  generally left untouched, and only the ceremonial parts of the building, as  the hypostyle halls, the courts, or pylons, were attacked. The procedure of  the Egyptians under these circumstances is best illustrated by the history  of the great temple of Karnak. Founded by Usertesen I., probably on the  site of a still earlier temple, it was but a small building, constructed of  limestone and sandstone, with granite doorways. The inside was decorated  with sixteen-sided pillars. The second and third Amenemhats added some work  to it, and the princes of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties adorned  it with statues and tables of offerings. It was still unaltered when, in  the eighteenth century B.C., Thothmes I., enriched with booty of war,  resolved to enlarge it. In advance of what already stood there, he "]]]
