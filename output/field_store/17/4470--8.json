The Convention for  3 days compared this report with the proceedings of the Convention. The  Constitution was ordered engrossed on Saturday, September 15.    The Convention met on Monday, September 17, for its final session.  Several of the delegates were disappointed in the result. A few deemed  the new Constitution a mere makeshift, a series of unfortunate  compromises. The advocates of the Constitution, realizing the impending  difficulty of obtaining the consent of the States to the new instrument  of Government, were anxious to obtain the unanimous support of the  delegations from each State. It was feared that many of the delegates  would refuse to give their individual assent to the Constitution.  Therefore, in order that the action of the convention would appear to be  unanimous, Gouverneur Morris devised the formula \"Done in Convention, by  the unanimous consent of the States present the 17th of September * * *  In witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names.\" Thirty-nine  of the forty-two delegates present thereupon \"subscribed\" to the  document.[m]    The Convention had been called to revise the Articles of Confederation.  Instead, it reported to the Continental Congress a new Constitution.  Furthermore, while the Articles specified that no amendments should be  effective until approved by the legislatures of all the States, the  Philadelphia Convention suggested that the new Constitution should  supplant the Articles of Confederation when ratified by conventions in  nine States. For these reasons, it was feared that the new Constitution  might arouse opposition in Congress.    Three members of the Convention--Madison, Gorham, and King--were also  Members of Congress. They proceeded at once to New York, where Congress  was in session, to placate the expected opposition. Aware of their  vanishing authority, Congress on September 28, after some debate,  decided to submit the Constitution to the States for action. It made no  recommendation for or against adoption.    Two parties soon developed, one in opposition and one in support of the  Constitution, and the Constitution was debated, criticized, and  expounded clause by clause. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay wrote a series of  commentaries, now known as the Federalist Papers, in support of the new  instrument of government.[n] The closeness and bitterness of the  struggle over ratification and the conferring of additional powers on  the central government can scarcely be exaggerated. In some States  ratification was effected only after a bitter struggle in the State  convention itself.    Delaware, on December 7, 1787, became the first State to ratify the new  Constitution, the vote being unanimous. Pennsylvania ratified on  December 12, 1787, by a vote of 46 to 23, a vote scarcely indicative of  the struggle which had taken place in that State. New Jersey ratified on  December 19, 1787, and Georgia on January 2, 1788, the vote in both  States being unanimous. Connecticut ratified on January 9, 1788; yeas  128, nays 40. On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts, by a narrow margin of  19 votes in a convention with a membership of 355, endorsed the new  Constitution, but recommended that a bill of rights be added to protect  the States from Federal encroachment on individual liberties. Maryland  ratified on April 28, 1788; yeas 63, nays 11. South Carolina ratified on  May 23, 1788; yeas 149, nays 73. On June 21, 1788, by a vote of 57 to  46, New Hampshire became the ninth State to ratify, but like  Massachusetts she suggested a bill of rights.    By the terms of the Constitution nine States were sufficient for its  establishment among the States so ratifying. The advocates of the new  Constitution realized, however, that the new government could not  succeed without the addition of New York and Virginia, neither of which  had ratified. Madison, Marshall, and Randolph led the struggle for  ratification in Virginia. On June 25, 1788, by a narrow margin of 10  votes in a convention of 168 members, that State ratified over the  objection of such delegates as George Mason and Patrick Henry. In New  York an attempt to attach conditions to ratification almost succeeded.  But on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a recommendation that a  bill of rights be appended. The vote was close--yeas 30, nays 27.    Eleven States having thus ratified the Constitution,[o] the Continental  Congress--which still functioned at irregular intervals--passed a  resolution on September 13, 1788, to put the new Constitution into  operation. The first Wednesday of January 1789 was fixed as the day for  choosing presidential electors, the first Wednesday of February for the  meeting of electors, and the first Wednesday of March (i.e. March 4,  1789) for the opening session of the new Congress. Owing to various  delays, Congress was late in assembling, and it was not until April 30,  1789, that George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of  the United States.      Notes    [a] The colonists, for example, claimed the right \"to life, liberty, and  property\", \"the rights, liberties, and immunities of free and  natural-born subjects within the realm of England\"; the right to  participate in legislative councils; \"the great and inestimable  privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to  the course of [the common law of England]\"; \"the immunities and  privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters, or secured  by their several codes of provincial laws\"; \"a right peaceably to  assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition the king.\" They  further declared that the keeping of a standing army in the colonies in  time of peace without the consent of the colony in which the army was  kept was \"against law\"; that it was \"indispensably necessary to good  government, and rendered essential by the English constitution, that the  constituent branches of the legislature be independent of each other\";  that certain acts of Parliament in contravention of the foregoing  principles were \"infringements and violations of the rights of the  colonists.\" (Text in Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the  Union, pp. 1-5.)

The  English were suffering terribly. Captain Manners himself was wounded,  and realizing that he was doomed to defeat unless by some desperate  effort he could avert it, he gave the signal to board. At the call the  boarders gathered, naked to the waist, black with powder and spattered  with blood, cutlas and pistol in hand. But the Americans were ready.  Their marines were drawn up on deck, the pikemen stood behind the  bulwarks, and the officers watched, cool and alert, every movement of  the foe. Then the British sea-dogs tumbled aboard, only to perish by  shot or steel. The combatants slashed and stabbed with savage fury, and  the assailants were driven back. Manners sprang to their head to lead  them again himself, when a ball fired by one of the sailors in the  American tops crashed through his skull, and he fell, sword in hand,  with his face to the foe, dying as honorable a death as ever a brave man  died in fighting against odds for the flag of his country. As he fell  the American officers passed the word to board. With wild cheers the  fighting sailormen sprang forward, sweeping the wreck of the British  force before them, and in a minute the Reindeer was in their possession.  All of her officers, and nearly two thirds of the crew, were killed or  wounded; but they had proved themselves as skilful as they were brave,  and twenty-six of the Americans had been killed or wounded.    The Wasp set fire to her prize, and after retiring to a French port to  refit, came out again to cruise. For some time she met no antagonist  of her own size with which to wage war, and she had to exercise the  sharpest vigilance to escape capture. Late one September afternoon, when  she could see ships of war all around her, she selected one which was  isolated from the others, and decided to run alongside her and try to  sink her after nightfall. Accordingly she set her sails in pursuit, and  drew steadily toward her antagonist, a big eighteen-gun brig, the Avon,  a ship more powerful than the Reindeer. The Avon kept signaling to two  other British war vessels which were in sight--one an eighteen-gun brig  and the other a twenty-gun ship; they were so close that the Wasp  was afraid they would interfere before the combat could be ended.  Nevertheless, Blakeley persevered, and made his attack with equal skill  and daring. It was after dark when he ran alongside his opponent,  and they began forthwith to exchange furious broadsides. As the ships  plunged and wallowed in the seas, the Americans could see the clusters  of topmen in the rigging of their opponent, but they knew nothing of  the vessel's name or of her force, save only so far as they felt it. The  firing was fast and furious, but the British shot with bad aim, while  the skilled American gunners hulled their opponent at almost every  discharge. In a very few minutes the Avon was in a sinking condition,  and she struck her flag and cried for quarter, having lost forty or  fifty men, while but three of the Americans had fallen. Before the Wasp  could take possession of her opponent, however, the two war vessels  to which the Avon had been signaling came up. One of them fired at the  Wasp, and as the latter could not fight two new foes, she ran off easily  before the wind. Neither of her new antagonists followed her, devoting  themselves to picking up the crew of the sinking Avon.     It would be hard to find a braver feat more skilfully performed  than this; for Captain Blakeley, with hostile foes all round him, had  closed with and sunk one antagonist not greatly his inferior in force,  suffering hardly any loss himself, while two of her friends were coming  to her help.    Both before and after this the Wasp cruised hither and thither making  prizes. Once she came across a convoy of ships bearing arms and  munitions to Wellington's army, under the care of a great two-decker.  Hovering about, the swift sloop evaded the two-decker's movements, and  actually cut out and captured one of the transports she was guarding,  making her escape unharmed. Then she sailed for the high seas. She made  several other prizes, and on October 9 spoke a Swedish brig.    This was the last that was ever heard of the gallant Wasp. She never  again appeared, and no trace of any of those aboard her was ever found.  Whether she was wrecked on some desert coast, whether she foundered  in some furious gale, or what befell her none ever knew. All that is  certain is that she perished, and that all on board her met death in  some one of the myriad forms in which it must always be faced by those  who go down to the sea in ships; and when she sank there sank one of the  most gallant ships of the American navy, with as brave a captain and  crew as ever sailed from any port of the New World.          THE \"GENERAL ARMSTRONG\" PRIVATEER       We have fought such a fight for a day and a night     As may never be fought again!     We have won great glory, my men!     And a day less or more     At sea or ashore,     We die--does it matter when?                      --Tennyson.      In the revolution, and again in the war of 1812, the seas were covered  by swift-sailing American privateers, which preyed on the British  trade. The hardy seamen of the New England coast, and of New York,  Philadelphia, and Baltimore, turned readily from their adventurous  careers in the whalers that followed the giants of the ocean in every  sea and every clime, and from trading voyages to the uttermost parts  of the earth, to go into the business of privateering, which was more  remunerative, and not so very much more dangerous, than their ordinary  pursuits. By the end of the war of 1812, in particular, the American  privateers had won for themselves a formidable position on the ocean.  The schooners, brigs, and brigantines in which the privateersmen sailed  were beautifully modeled, and were among the fastest craft afloat. They  were usually armed with one heavy gun, the \"long Tom,\" as it was called,  arranged on a pivot forward or amidships, and with a few lighter pieces  of cannon. They carried strong crews of well-armed men, and their  commanders were veteran seamen, used to brave every danger from the  elements or from man. So boldly did they prey on the British commerce,  that they infested even the Irish Sea and the British Channel, and  increased many times the rate of insurance on vessels passing across  those waters. They also often did battle with the regular men-of-war of  the British, being favorite objects for attack by cutting-out parties  from the British frigates and ships of the line, and also frequently  encountering in fight the smaller sloops-of-war. Usually, in these  contests, the privateersmen were worsted, for they had not the training  which is obtained only in a regular service, and they were in no way to  be compared to the little fleet of regular vessels which in this same  war so gloriously upheld the honor of the American flag. Nevertheless,  here and there a privateer commanded by an exceptionally brave and able  captain, and manned by an unusually well-trained crew, performed some  feat of arms which deserves to rank with anything ever performed by the  regular navy. Such a feat was the defense of the brig General Armstrong,  in the Portuguese port of Fayal, of the Azores, against an overwhelming  British force.    The General Armstrong hailed from New York, and her captain was named  Reid. She had a crew of ninety men, and was armed with one heavy 32  pounder and six lighter guns. In December, 1814, she was lying in Fayal,  a neutral port, when four British war-vessels, a ship of the line, a  frigate and two brigs, hove into sight, and anchored off the mouth of  the harbor. The port was neutral, but Portugal was friendly to England,  and Reid knew well that the British would pay no respect to the  neutrality laws if they thought that at the cost of their violation they  could destroy the privateer. He immediately made every preparation to  resist an attack, The privateer was anchored close to the shore. The  boarding-nettings were got ready, and were stretched to booms thrust  outward from the brig's side, so as to check the boarders as they tried  to climb over the bulwarks. The guns were loaded and cast loose, and the  men went to quarters armed with muskets, boarding-pikes, and cutlases.    On their side the British made ready to carry the privateer by boarding.  The shoals rendered it impossible for the heavy ships to approach,  and the lack of wind and the baffling currents also interfered for the  moment with the movements of the sloops-of-war. Accordingly recourse was  had to a cutting-out party, always a favorite device with the British  seamen of that age, who were accustomed to carry French frigates by  boarding, and to capture in their boats the heavy privateers and armed  merchantmen, as well as the lighter war-vessels of France and Spain.    The British first attempted to get possession of the brig by surprise,  sending out but four boats. These worked down near to the brig, under  pretense of sounding, trying to get close enough to make a rush and  board her. The privateersmen were on their guard, and warned the boats  off, and after the warning had been repeated once or twice unheeded,  they fired into them, killing and wounding several men. Upon this the  boats promptly returned to the ships.    This first check greatly irritated the British captains, and they  decided to repeat the experiment that night with a force which would  render resistance vain. Accordingly, after it became dark, a dozen  boats were sent from the liner and the frigate, manned by four hundred  stalwart British seamen, and commanded by the captain of one of the  brigs of war. Through the night they rowed straight toward the little  privateer lying dark and"]]]
