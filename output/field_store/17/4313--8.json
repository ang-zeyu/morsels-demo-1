This occasion is not only a happy one for him, it is also for us.  This shows that though the enemies of re-building Palestine were, and  are still, many, Palestine is, nevertheless, steadily but surely being  rebuilt.\"    Mr. Diznoff, in the name of the Colony of Tel-Avis wrote: \"On this great  occasion, we should like to say, that as you have merited to see that  the \"howling desert\" you have found, you have succeeded in creating into  a \"Garden of Eden,\" thus may you merit to see the flourishing state of  the whole of Palestine.\"    Mr. Ephraim Blumenfeld wrote: \"Though I should have very much have  liked to be present, yet my present bad state of health does not enable  me to do so. This is a happy moment for all lovers of Zion. May you  merit to see with your own eyes the restoration of Israel on its own  land.\"    Messages and telegrams were also received from the Yeshivah Me'ah  Shearim, Mr. D. Slutskin, from the scholars of the Yeshivah \"Or Zoraiah\"  of Jaffa and many synagogues. Also from Mr. Friedenberg of Jerusalem,  Mr. S. Tolkovsky, Dr. Eliash, from the Chief Rabbi of Alexandria, from  the \"Old Aged\" Home in Jaffe, from the Mizrachi, from Rabbi S.L. Shapiro  of Jerusalem, etc., etc.    At the request of the host, who is a British subject, a special prayer  was offered up for the Divine protection of King George the Fifth, and  also prayers in the name of R. Barnett for the health of the High  Commissioner, the Secretary, the leaders of the Zionist  Movement--Weitzman, Sokolov and Usishkin, for the Chief Rabbis of  Palestine and for the Rabbi Sonnenfeld, Rabbis Diskin, Epstein, etc.,  etc.    Mr. Barnett offered a certain sum in the name of each, and among the  numerous institutions to which he contributed were the following: Hebrew  Archaeological Society at Jerusalem, the building of a synagogue on the  site of the Old Temple Wall, the school for the blind, the poor of  Jaffe, the Home for Aged Jews, etc., etc.    Mr. Barnett was then enrolled in the Golden Book by those present. Great  indeed was the honour which R. Zorach Barnett and his wife received on  that day, but they were really worthy of it.    May theirs be an example to others!          GLOSSARY      BAR COCHBA.

It  was bronzed in color, and was apparently spreading. I at once applied  the intermittent ligature just above the elbow, and injected the  permanganate of potassium solution freely all through the involved  tissues, particularly in the region of the bite and about the  periphery of the swelling, surrounding the latter by a complete ring  of injections.    The general treatment of this patient was continued on the same  general line as described in the former cases, stimulants being  employed moderately. He recovered without any bad symptoms. There was  no sloughing; the swelling disappeared without any necrosis of tissue.  He is still pursuing his trade in Cheyenne, and suffers from  absolutely no disability.    I saw but one case shortly after the wound was inflicted. This patient  was a healthy young man, who was struck about the middle of the dorsal  surface of the hand, the fangs entering on each side of a metacarpal  bone, and the poison lodging apparently in the palm of the hand. The  patient, when seen, exhibited the characteristic terror and  depression, weak, rapid heart action, and agonizing local pain. I made  two small incisions in the region of the wound upon the dorsum of the  hand, and injected permanganate of potassium freely. This patient  ultimately recovered, but only after sloughing and prolonged  suppuration. I believe that had I incised freely and at once from the  palmar surface, I would have been spared this unpleasant complication.    I have had in all nine cases, and without a single death. The others  are in their general features and in the treatment employed quite  similar to those given.    The symptoms resulting from snake bite poison are strikingly like  those dependent upon the violent septic poison seen in pre-antiseptic  times. There is often the same prodromal chill, the high elevation of  temperature, the profound effect on the circulation, and the rapid  cellular involvement. The tissue disturbance following snake poisoning  differs from ordinary cellulitis, however, in the following  particulars: The color is _bronze_, not red; the involved area is  _boggy_, not brawny; and the extension of the process is _exceedingly  rapid_.    The treatment applicable to one condition seems to be equally  successful when applied to the other. In cellulitis, free incisions,  antiseptic lotions, and active stimulation are the three means upon  which the surgeon mainly depends, and in combating the local and  general symptoms excited by snake bite poisoning, the same treatment  has given me the successful results detailed above. Whether or not  permanganate of potassium is more active than other antiseptics in  snake bite poisoning I am not prepared to state, but the high  authority of S. Weir Mitchell, together with my own experience, does  not incline me to substitute any other drug at present.    I would formulate the treatment for poison of the rattlesnake as  follows:    1. Free incisions to the bottom of the wound and immediate  cauterization; or, if this is not practicable, sucking of the wound.    2. The immediate application of an intermittent tourniquet, that is,  one which is relaxed for a moment at a time, so that the poison may  gain admission into the circulation in small doses.    3. The free administration of alcohol or carbonate of ammonium.    This might be termed the _urgency treatment_ of snake bite poisoning.  The _curative treatment_ requires--    4. Free incisions into all portions of the inflamed tissues, and the  thorough kneading into these incisions of a fifteen per cent. solution  of permanganate of potassium.    5. Multiple injections of the same solution into all the inflamed  regions, but particularly into the region of the wound.    6. The complete surrounding of all the involved tissues, by  permanganate of potassium injections placed from half an inch to an  inch apart, the needle being driven into the healthy tissue just  beyond the line of demarkation, and its point being carried to the  deepest part of the border of the indurated area.    7. The permanganate of potassium solution should be used freely in  fifteen per cent. solution. I have used one and a half drachms of the  pure drug diluted, and would not hesitate to use four times that  quantity were it necessary, since it seems to exert no deleterious  effect, either locally or generally.    8. The involved area should be dressed by means of lint saturated with  fifteen per cent. permanganate of potassium solution. Stimulants  should be given according to the indications--i.e., the condition of  the pulse. Laxatives, diuretics, and diaphoretics should be  administered to aid in the elimination of the poison. The diet should  be as nutritious as the stomach can digest.--_The Therapeutic  Gazette_.           *       *       *       *       *          CHINESE COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS.      Wuchang, on the Yangtsze opposite Hankow, is the capital of the two  provinces Hupeh and Hunan. Here, every third year, the examination for  competitors from both provinces is held, and a correspondent of the  _North China Herald_, of Shanghai, describes the scene at the  examination at the beginning of September last. The streets, he says,  are thronged with long-robed, large-spectacled gentlemen, who inform  the world at large by every fold of drapery, every swagger of gait,  every curve of nail, that they are the aristocracy of the most ancient  empire of the world. Wuchang had from 12,000 to 15,000 bachelors of  arts within its walls, who came from the far borders of the province  for the examination for the provincial degree. About one-half per  cent. will be successful; thousands of them know they have not the  shadow of a chance, but literary etiquette binds them to appear. In  the wake of these Confucian scholars come a rout of traders, painters,  scroll sellers, teapot venders, candle merchants, spectacle mongers,  etc.; servants and friends swell the number, so that the examination  makes a difference of some 40,000 or 50,000 to the resident  population. In the great examination hall, which is composed of a  series of pens shut off from each other in little rows of 20 or 30,  and the view of which is suggestive of a huge cattle market, there is  accommodation for over 10,000 candidates. The observance of rules of  academic propriety is very strict. A candidate may be excluded, not  only for incompetence, but for writing his name in the wrong place,  for tearing or blotting his examination paper, etc. After the  examination of each batch a list of those allowed to compete for  honors is published, and the essay forms for each district are  prepared with proper names and particulars. The ancestors of the  candidate for three generations must be recorded, they must be free  from taint of _yamen_ service, prostitution, the barber's trade and  the theater, or the candidate would not have obtained his first  degree. With the forms 300 cash (about 1s.) are presented to each  candidate for food during the ordeal. The lists being thus prepared,  on the sixth day of the eighth moon (Tuesday, the 8th of September, in  1891), the city takes a holiday to witness the ceremony of \"entering  the curtain,\" i.e., opening the examination hall. For days coolies  have been pumping water into great tanks, droves of pigs have been  driven into the inclosure, doctors, tailors, cooks, coffins, printers,  etc., have been massed within the hall for possible needs. The  imperial commissioners are escorted by the examination officials to  the place. A dozen district magistrates have been appointed to  superintend within the walls, and as many more outside, two prefects  have office inside, and the governor of the province has also to be  locked up during the eight days of examination. The whole company is  first entertained to breakfast at the _yamen_, and then the procession  forms; the ordinary umbrellas, lictors, gongs, feathers, and  ragamuffins are there in force; the examiners and the highest officers  are carried in open chairs draped in scarlet and covered with tiger  skins. The dead silence that falls on the crowd betokens the approach  of the governor, who brings up the rear. Then the bustle of the actual  examination begins. The hall is a miniature city. Practically martial  law is proclaimed. In the central tower is a sword, and misdemeanor  within the limits is punished with instant death. The mandarins take  up their quarters in their respective lodges, the whole army of  writers whose duty it is to copy out the essays of the candidates, to  prevent collusion, take their places. Altogether there must be over  20,000 people shut in. Cases have been known in which a hopeful  candidate was crushed to death in the crowd at the gate. Each  candidate is first identified, and he is assigned a certain number  which corresponds to a cell a few feet square, containing one board  for a seat and one for a desk. Meanwhile the printers in the building  are hard at work printing the essay texts. Each row of cells has two  attendants for cooking, etc., assigned to it, the candidates take  their seats, the rows are locked from the outside, the themes are  handed out, the contest has begun. The examination is divided into  three bouts of about 36 hours, two nights and a day, each, with  intervals of a day. The first is the production of three essays on the  four assigned books; the second of five essays on the five classics;  the third of five essays on miscellaneous subjects. The strain, as may  be imagined, is very great, and several victims die in the hall. The  literary ambition which leads old men of 60 and 70 to enter not  unfrequently destroys them. Should any fatal case occur, the coffin  may on no account be carried out through the gates; it must be lifted  over or sometimes through a breach in the wall. Death must not pollute  the great entrance. At the end of the"]]]
