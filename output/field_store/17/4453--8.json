And the said greyhounds came to him  and fawned on him, they havinge about theire necks either of them a  coller, and to either of which collers was tyed a stringe, which  collers as this informer affirmeth did shine like gould, and hee  thinkinge that some either of Mr. _Nutter's_ or Mr. _Robinson's_  family should have followed them: but seeinge noe body to followe  them, he tooke the said greyhounds thinkinge to hunt with them, and  presently a hare did rise very neare before him, at the sight whereof  he cryed, loo, loo, but the dogges would not run. Whereupon beeinge  very angry, he tooke them, and with the strings that were at theire  collers tyed either of them to a little bush on the next hedge, and  with a rod that hee had in his hand, hee bett them. And in stede of  the blacke greyhound, one _Dickonson_ wife stoode up (a neighb^r.)  whom this informer knoweth, and in steade of the browne greyhound a  little boy whom this informer knoweth not. At which sight this  informer beeinge affraid indevoured to run away: but beeinge stayed by  the woman, viz. by _Dickonson's_ wife, shee put her hand into her  pocket, and pulled out a peace of silver much like to a faire  shillinge, and offered to give him to hould his tongue, and not to  tell, whiche hee refused, sayinge, nay thou art a witch; Whereupon  shee put her hand into her pocket againe, and pulled out a stringe  like unto a bridle[48] that gingled, which shee put upon the litle  boyes heade that stood up in the browne greyhounds steade; whereupon  the said boy stood up a white horse. Then immediately the said  _Dickonson_ wife tooke this informer before her upon the said horse,  and carried him to a new house called _Hoarestones_,[49] beinge about  a quarter of a mile off, whither, when they were comme, there were  divers persons about the doore, and hee sawe divers others cominge  rideinge upon horses of severall colours towards the said house, which  tyed theire horses to a hedge neare to the sed house; and which  persons went into the sed house, to the number of threescore or  thereabouts, as this informer thinketh, where they had a fyer and  meate roastinge, and some other meate stirringe in the house, whereof  a yonge woman whom hee this informer knoweth not, gave him flesh and  breade upon a trencher, and drinke in a glasse, which, after the first  taste, hee refused, and would have noe more, and said it was nought.  And presently after, seeinge diverse of the company goinge to a barn  neare adioyneinge,[50] hee followed after, and there he sawe sixe of  them kneelinge, and pullinge at sixe severall roapes which were  fastened or tyed to ye toppe of the house; at or with which pullinge  came then in this informers sight flesh smoakeinge, butter in lumps,  and milke as it were syleinge[51] from the said roapes, all which fell  into basons whiche were placed under the saide roapes. And after that  these sixe had done, there came other sixe which did likewise, and  duringe all the tyme of theire so pullinge, they made such foule faces  that feared[52] this informer, soe as hee was glad to steale out and  run home, whom, when they wanted, some of theire company came runninge  after him neare to a place in a high way, called Boggard-hole,[53]  where this informer met two horsemen, at the sight whereof the sed  persons left followinge him, and the foremost of which persons yt  followed him, hee knoweth to bee one _Loynd_ wife, which said wife,  together with one _Dickonson_ wife, and one _Jenet Davies_[54] he hath  seene at severall tymes in a croft or close adioninge to his fathers  house, whiche put him in a greate feare. And further, this informer  saith, upon Thursday after New Yeares day last past, he sawe the sed  _Loynd_ wife sittinge upon a crosse peece of wood, beeinge within the  chimney of his father's dwellinge house, and hee callinge to her,  said, come downe thou _Loynd_ wife, and immediately the sed _Loynd_  wife went up out of his sight. And further, this informer saith, yt  after hee was comme from ye company aforesed to his father's house,  beeinge towards eveninge, his father bad him goe fetch home two kyne  to seale,[55] and in the way, in a field called the Ollers, hee  chanced to hap upon a boy, who began to quarrell with him, and they  fought soe together till this informer had his eares made very bloody  by fightinge, and lookinge downe, hee sawe the boy had a cloven foote,  at which sight hee was affraid, and ran away from him to seeke the  kyne. And in the way hee sawe a light like a lanthorne, towards which  he made hast, supposinge it to bee carried by some of Mr. _Robinson's_  people: But when hee came to the place, hee onley found a woman  standinge on a bridge, whom, when hee sawe her, he knewe to bee  _Loynd_ wife, and knowinge her, he turned backe againe, and immediatly  hee met with ye aforesed boy, from whom he offered to run, which boy  gave him a blow on the back which caus'd him to cry. And hee farther  saith, yt when hee was in the barne, he sawe three women take three  pictures from off the beame, in the which pictures many thornes, or  such like things sticked, and yt _Loynd_ wife tooke one of the said  pictures downe, but thother two women yt tooke thother two pictures  downe hee knoweth not.[56] And beeinge further asked, what persons  were at ye meeteinge aforesed, hee nominated these persons hereafter  mentioned, viz. _Dickonson_ wife, _Henry Priestley_ wife and her sone,  _Alice Hargreaves_ widdowe, _Jennet Davies_, _Wm. Davies_, uxor.  _Hen. Jacks_ and her sone _John_, _James Hargreaves_ of _Marsden_,  _Miles_ wife of _Dicks_, _James_ wife, _Saunders_ sicut credit,  _Lawrence_ wife of _Saunders_, _Loynd_ wife, _Buys_ wife of  _Barrowford_, one _Holgate_ and his wife sicut credit, _Little Robin_  wife of _Leonard's_, of the _West Cloase_.[57]    [Footnote 44: Wheatley-lane is still a place of note in Pendle.]    [Footnote 45: Wild plums.]    [Footnote 46: It would seem as if a case of witchcraft in Pendle,  without a Nutter in some way connected with it, could not occur.]    [Footnote 47: What Mr. Robinson is intended does not appear.

We never seek things for themselves, but for the search.  Likewise in plays, scenes which do not rouse the emotion of fear are  worthless, so are extreme and hopeless misery, brutal lust, and extreme  cruelty.      136    A mere trifle consoles us, for a mere trifle distresses us.[68]      137    Without examining every particular pursuit, it is enough to comprehend  them under diversion.      138    Men naturally slaters and of all callings, save in their own rooms.      139    _Diversion._--When I have occasionally set myself to consider the  different distractions of men, the pains and perils to which they expose  themselves at court or in war, whence arise so many quarrels, passions,  bold and often bad ventures, etc., I have discovered that all the  unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay  quietly in their own chamber. A man who has enough to live on, if he  knew how to stay with pleasure at home, would not leave it to go to sea  or to besiege a town. A commission in the army would not be bought so  dearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the town;  and men only seek conversation and entering games, because they cannot  remain with pleasure at home.    But on further consideration, when, after finding the cause of all our  ills, I have sought to discover the reason of it, I have found that  there is one very real reason, namely, the natural poverty of our feeble  and mortal condition, so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we  think of it closely.    Whatever condition we picture to ourselves, if we muster all the good  things which it is possible to possess, royalty is the finest position  in the world. Yet, when we imagine a king attended with every pleasure  he can feel, if he be without diversion, and be left to consider and  reflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him; he  will necessarily fall into forebodings of dangers, of revolutions which  may happen, and, finally, of death and inevitable disease; so that if he  be without what is called diversion, he is unhappy, and more unhappy  than the least of his subjects who plays and diverts himself.    Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and high posts,  are so sought after. Not that there is in fact any happiness in them, or  that men imagine true bliss to consist in money won at play, or in the  hare which they hunt; we would not take these as a gift. We do not seek  that easy and peaceful lot which permits us to think of our unhappy  condition, nor the dangers of war, nor the labour of office, but the  bustle which averts these thoughts of ours, and amuses us.    Reasons why we like the chase better than the quarry.    Hence it comes that men so much love noise and stir; hence it comes that  the prison is so horrible a punishment; hence it comes that the pleasure  of solitude is a thing incomprehensible. And it is in fact the greatest  source of happiness in the condition of kings, that men try incessantly  to divert them, and to procure for them all kinds of pleasures.    The king is surrounded by persons whose only thought is to divert the  king, and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is unhappy, king  though he be, if he think of himself.    This is all that men have been able to discover to make themselves  happy. And those who philosophise on the matter, and who think men  unreasonable for spending a whole day in chasing a hare which they would  not have bought, scarce know our nature. The hare in itself would not  screen us from the sight of death and calamities; but the chase which  turns away our attention from these, does screen us.    The advice given to Pyrrhus to take the rest which he was about to seek  with so much labour, was full of difficulties.[69]    [To bid a man live quietly is to bid him live happily. It is to advise  him to be in a state perfectly happy, in which he can think at leisure  without finding therein a cause of distress. This is to misunderstand  nature.    As men who naturally understand their own condition avoid nothing so  much as rest, so there is nothing they leave undone in seeking turmoil.  Not that they have an instinctive knowledge of true happiness ...    So we are wrong in blaming them. Their error does not lie in seeking  excitement, if they seek it only as a diversion; the evil is that they  seek it as if the possession of the objects of their quest would make  them really happy. In this respect it is right to call their quest a  vain one. Hence in all this both the censurers and the censured do not  understand man's true nature.]    And thus, when we take the exception against them, that what they seek  with such fervour cannot satisfy them, if they replied--as they should  do if they considered the matter thoroughly--that they sought in it only  a violent and impetuous occupation which turned their thoughts from  self, and that they therefore chose an attractive object to charm and  ardently attract them, they would leave their opponents without a  reply. But they do not make this reply, because they do not know  themselves.[70] They do not know that it is the chase, and not the  quarry, which they seek.    Dancing: we must consider rightly where to place our feet.--A gentleman  sincerely believes that hunting is great and royal sport; but a beater  is not of this opinion.    They imagine that if they obtained such a post, they would then rest  with pleasure, and are insensible of the insatiable nature of their  desire. They think they are truly seeking quiet, and they are only  seeking excitement.    They have a secret instinct which impels them to seek amusement and  occupation abroad, and which arises from the sense of their constant  unhappiness. They have another secret instinct, a remnant of the  greatness of our original nature, which teaches them that happiness in  reality consists only in rest, and not in stir. And of these two  contrary instincts they form within themselves a confused idea, which  hides itself from their view in the depths of their soul, inciting them  to aim at rest through excitement, and always to fancy that the  satisfaction which they have not will come to them, if, by surmounting  whatever difficulties confront them, they can thereby open the door to  rest.    Thus passes away all man's life. Men seek rest in a struggle against  difficulties; and when they have conquered these, rest becomes  insufferable. For we think either of the misfortunes we have or of those  which threaten us. And even if we should see ourselves sufficiently  sheltered on all sides, weariness of its own accord would not fail to  arise from the depths of the heart wherein it has its natural roots, and  to fill the mind with its poison.    Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for  weariness from the peculiar state of his disposition; and so frivolous  is he, that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least  thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient to  amuse him.    But will you say what object has he in all this? The pleasure of  bragging to-morrow among his friends that he has played better than  another. So others sweat in their own rooms to show to the learned that  they have solved a problem in algebra, which no one had hitherto been  able to solve. Many more expose themselves to extreme perils, in my  opinion as foolishly, in order to boast afterwards that they have  captured a town. Lastly, others wear themselves out in studying all  these things, not in order to become wiser, but only in order to prove  that they know them; and these are the most senseless of the band, since  they are so knowingly, whereas one may suppose of the others, that if  they knew it, they would no longer be foolish.    This man spends his life without weariness in playing every day for a  small stake. Give him each morning the money he can win each day, on  condition he does not play; you make him miserable. It will perhaps be  said that he seeks the amusement of play and not the winnings. Make him  then play for nothing; he will not become excited over it, and will feel  bored. It is then not the amusement alone that he seeks; a languid and  passionless amusement will weary him. He must get excited over it, and  deceive himself by the fancy that he will be happy to win what he would  not have as a gift on condition of not playing; and he must make for  himself an object of passion, and excite over it his desire, his anger,  his fear, to obtain his imagined end, as children are frightened at the  face they have blackened.    Whence comes it that this man, who lost his only son a few months ago,  or who this morning was in such trouble through being distressed by  lawsuits and quarrels, now no longer thinks of them? Do not wonder; he  is quite taken up in looking out for the boar which his dogs have been  hunting so hotly for the last six hours. He requires nothing more.  However full of sadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if you  can prevail upon him to enter into some amusement; and however happy a  man may be, he will soon be discontented and wretched, if he be not  diverted and occupied by some passion or pursuit which prevents  weariness from overcoming him. Without amusement there is no joy; with  amusement there is no sadness. And this also constitutes the happiness  of persons in high position, that they have a number of people to amuse  them, and have the power to keep themselves in this state.    Consider this. What is it to be superintendent, chancellor, first  president, but to be in a condition wherein from early morning a large  number of people come from all quarters to see them, so as not to leave  them an hour in the day in which they can think of themselves? And when  they are in"]]]
