This  little mushroom we found in a thick woods late in September, growing  among dead leaves. There were oak trees all around and a great many  pines. The weather had been rainy, and it was pale-colored and looked  water-soaked.      +TRICHOLOMA IMBRICATA = a tile.+    +The Imbricated Tricholoma.+    +Cap+ reddish-brown, 3 inches broad, thick, fleshy, broadly convex, and  then flattened, obtuse, dry, continuous at disc, but torn into scales  and fibrillose toward the margin; flesh firm, white. +Stem+ solid,  stout, sometimes short, and conico-bulbous, 1 1/2 to 2 inches long, and  as much as 1 inch thick, sometimes longer and almost equal; white at  apex. +Gills+ slightly emarginate, almost adnate, somewhat crowded,  about 3 inches broad, wholly white when young, at length reddish. It  grows either scattered or in groups. It is found in pine woods in  September and November.      +BOLETUS ORNATIPES = ornate and foot.+    +The Ornate-stemmed Boletus.+    +Cap+ 2 to 5 inches broad, yellowish-brown, convex, dry, firm, glabrous  or minutely tomentose, flesh yellow or pale yellow. +Tubes+ adnate,  plane or concave, the mouths small or middle size, a clear yellow.  +Stem+ 2 to 4 inches long, 4 to 6 lines broad, subequal, distinctly and  beautifully reticulated, yellow without and within. In woods and open  places.      +BOLETUS BREVIPES = short and foot.+    +The Short-stemmed Boletus.+    +Cap+ dark chestnut color, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 inches broad, thick, convex,  covered with a tough gluten, margin inflexed, flesh white or yellowish.  +Tubes+ short, nearly plane, adnate, or slightly depressed around the  stem, small, white and afterward dingy ochraceous. +Stem+ 1/2 to 1 inch  long, 3 to 5 lines thick, whitish, very short, not dotted, or rarely  with a few inconspicuous dots at the edge. This plant was found in  October, and looked as if it rested upon the ground, the stem was so  short; the cap was covered with gluten.      [Illustration: Lepiota procera.    Photographed by C. G. Lloyd.]      +LEPIOTA PROCERA = tall.+    +The Tall Lepiota.+    +Cap+ reddish-brown, 3 to 6 inches broad, fleshy; when young egg-shaped,  and then campanulate, and flattening out with a broad, obtuse umbo. The  cuticle breaks up into brownish scales, close near the centre, but  sometimes wanting at the margin. The centre or umbo is darker colored;  flesh dry, tough and white. +Stem+ 1/2 inch thick, and 5 to 10 inches  long; it is straight or a little bent, swollen or bulbous at base,  sometimes variegated with brownish scales; deeply sunk at apex into the  cup of the pileus; hollow or stuffed. +Ring+ distinct from the stem,  continuous with cuticle of pileus when young. It becomes free when the  cap is expanded, and is then movable and persistent. +Gills+ far remote  from the stem, with a broad plano-depressed cartilaginous collar,  crowded, ventricose, broader in front, soft, whitish, sometimes becoming  dusky at the edge. The gills vary in color. This mushroom is a handsome  species and is quite common in woods and pastures. (Edible.)      +BOLETUS EDULIS = edible.+    +The Edible Boletus.+    +Cap+ varies sometimes in color (our specimen was brown). It is often a  tawny light brown, paler at the margin, 4 to 6 inches broad, flesh white  or yellowish, tinged with red under the cuticle. +Tubes+ convex, nearly  free, long, +minute+, round, white, then yellow and greenish. +Stem+ 2  to 6 inches long, 6 to 18 lines thick, straight or bending, subequal or  bulbous, short, more or less reticulated, especially above, whitish,  pale reddish or brown. Found in August. Our specimen was small, the stem  only 1 1/2 inch long. (Edible.)      +BOLETUS SCABER = rough.+    +The Scabrous-stemmed Boletus.+    +Cap+ varies in color, 1 to 5 inches broad, yellowish tan color, smooth,  viscid when moist, at length rivulose. Tubes free, convex, white, then  dingy color, mouths of tubes very small and round. +Stem+ 3 to 5 inches  long, 3 to 8 lines thick, solid, tapering above, roughened with fibrous  scales. We found two or three varieties of this Boletus, which seems to  grow everywhere in great abundance, in summer and autumn, in woods and  in open places. One variety was of a yellowish tan color, Var.  alutaceus, in another the flesh changed slightly to pinkish when  wounded, Var. mutabilis (Peck). (Edible.)      +BOLETUS CASTANEUS = chestnut.+    +The Chestnut Boletus.+    +Cap+ a chestnut color, brown or reddish brown, 1 1/2 to 3 inches broad,  convex, nearly plane or depressed, firm, even, dry, minutely velvety  (tomentose), flesh white. +Tubes+ free, short, small, white, becoming  yellow. +Stem+ 1 to 2 1/2 inches long, 3 to 5 lines thick, equal or  tapering upward, even, stuffed or hollow, colored like the cap. This is  one of the prettiest of the Boleti. The bright chestnut color of the  pileus forms a contrast with the white tubes, and makes it striking in  appearance. We found it on several occasions, as it is common in woods.  There are differences of opinion in regard to its being edible.      +BOLETUS CHRYSENTERON = golden.+    +The Golden Flesh Boletus.+    +Cap+ dark brown or reddish-brown, 1 to 3 inches broad, convex or plane,  soft, covered with woolly scales, sometimes marked with lines, flesh  yellow, red beneath the cuticle, often slowly changing to blue when  wounded, mouths large, angular, unequal. +Stem+ 1 to 3 inches long, 3 to  6 lines thick, rigid, fibrous, striate, equal, reddish or pale yellow.  This species is variable. We found one where the flesh was white,  another where the tubes changed finally to green, and one that had an  olive tint in the pileus.      +BOLETUS ILLUDENS = deceiving.+    +The Deceiving Boletus.+    +Cap+ yellow or olive brown, 3 inches broad, plane, dry, marked with  areoles, that is, the surface is broken up into little areas or patches.  Flesh thick, white, red under cuticle. +Tubes+ greenish-yellow, turning  dark green, adnato-decurrent, that is, broadly attached to the stem and  running down it, 1/8 inch long. +Stem+ 2 1/2 inches long, stuffed with  brownish fibres, reticulated near apex, paler color than cap, curved.      +BOLETUS PACHYPUS = thick.+    +The Thick-stemmed Boletus.+    +Cap+ tan color, 4 to 8 inches broad, convex, somewhat covered with  long, soft hairs pressed closely to surface, subtomentose; flesh thick,  whitish, changing slightly to blue. +Tubes+ rather long, depressed  around the stem, mouths round, pale yellow, at length tinged with green.  +Stem+ 2 to 4 inches long, thick, firm, reticulated, at first ovate,  bulbous, then lengthened, equal, tinted pale yellow and red. The stem in  the specimen was 1/4 inch thick, swelling from apex downward, but it often  measures 2 inches in thickness. This Boletus is considered poisonous.      +BOLETUS SUBTOMENTOSUS = almost velvety.+    +The Yellow-cracked Boletus.+    +Cap+ dark brown, 1 to 4 inches broad, convex or nearly plane, soft,  dry, covered with soft, weak, appressed hairs, almost olivaceous, of the  same color beneath the cuticle, often marked with cracks and divided  into little patches; flesh white or pallid. +Tubes+ adnate, or depressed  around the +stem+, yellow, mouths large, angular. +Stem+ 1 to 2 1/2  inches long, 2 to 5 lines thick, stout, somewhat ribbed, or scurfy,  with minute dots. The cap varies in color, it may be yellowish-brown.  We found the dark brown species growing on decaying wood, in pine woods,  during the month of September.      +BOLETUS PIPERATUS = peppery.+    +The Peppery Boletus.+    +Cap+ reddish-brown or ochraceous, 1 to 3 inches broad, convex or nearly  plane, smooth, slightly viscid when moist, flesh white or yellowish,  taste acrid, peppery. +Tubes+ long, large, unequal, plane or convex,  adnate or nearly decurrent, reddish, ferruginous. +Stem+ 1 1/2 to 3  inches long, 2 to 4 lines thick, slender, almost equal, tawny yellow;  at the base a bright yellow. The cap in our specimen was marked with  cracks and patches, and the margin obtuse. The stem was rather curved,  and the same color as the cap. Flesh yellow. Tubes a dark-reddish,  decided color, which makes it a striking-looking mushroom. Taste  peppery.      +BOLETUS SORDIDUS = dingy.+    +The Dingy-colored Boletus.+    +Cap+ a dingy, dark brown, about 2 inches broad, flesh white, tinged  with red. +Tubes+ long, nearly free, 3/8 inch long, white, turning a dark  bluish-green. +Stem+ tapering toward apex, 2 1/2 inches long, curved,  solid, 1/2 inch thick, brownish, marked with darker streaks. The mouths  of tubes were angular, and the stem striate in our specimen. Found in  the woods in August.      +BOLETUS SUBLUTEUS = almost, and yellow.+    +The Small Yellow Boletus.+    +Cap+ brownish yellow, 1 1/2 to 3 inches broad, convex or nearly plane,  viscid or glutinous when moist, often obscurely streaked (virgate).  Flesh whitish or dull yellowish. +Tubes+ plane or convex, adnate, small,  nearly round, yellow, becoming ochraceous. +Stem+ 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 inches  long, 2 to 4 lines thick, equal, slender, pale or yellowish, dotted  above and below the ring with reddish, brownish, moist, or sticky dots  (glandules). +Ring+ almost soft, glutinous, at first concealing the  tubes, then collapsing and forming a narrow whitish or brownish band  around the stem. Our Boletus had a brownish ring. The cap was covered  with a sticky, skin-like layer, called the pellicle or cuticle, both  terms having the same meaning.      +BOLETUS AFFINIS = related.+    +The Related Boletus.+    +Cap+ reddish-brown, fading to yellow, 2 to 4 inches broad, convex above  and almost plane, nearly smooth, flesh white. +Tubes+ plane or convex,  adnate or slightly compressed around the stem, at first white and  stuffed, then yellowish, turning to rusty ochraceous when wounded.  +Stem+ 1 1/2 to 3 inches long, 4 to 8 lines thick, nearly equal,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18458"],[0,"Star Born (#12)"],[1," spear, the barbed  head of which was dyed the same reddish yellow as the blood still  seeping from the torn body. Swinging the weapon so close to Raf that  the Terran was forced to retreat a step or two to escape contact with  the grisly relic, the officer burst into an impassioned speech. Then  he went back to the gestures which were easier for the spaceman to  understand.    This was the work of a deadly enemy, Raf gathered. And such a fate  awaited any one of them who ventured beyond certain bounds of safety.  Unless this enemy were destroyed, the city--life itself--was no  longer theirs--    Seeing those savage wounds which suggested that an insane fury had  driven the attacker, Raf could believe that. But surely a primitive  spear was no equal to the weapons his guide could command.    When he tried to suggest that, the other shook his head as if  despairing of making plain his real message, and again beckoned Raf to  come with him. They were out on the littered street, heading away from  the central building where the rest of the Terran party must still be.  And Raf, seeing the lengthening shadows, the pools of dusk gathering,  and remembering that spear, could not resist glancing back over his  shoulder now and then. He wondered if the metallic click of his boot  soles on the pavement might not draw attention to them, attention they  would not care to meet. His hand was on his stun gun. But the officer  gave no sign of being worried; he walked along with the assurance of  one who has nothing to fear.    Then Raf caught sight of a patch of color he had seen before and  relaxed. They _were_ on their way back to the flitter! He had come  down this very street earlier. And he did not mind the long climb  back, ramp by steep ramp, which brought him out at last beside the  flyer. His relief was so great that he put out his hand to draw it  along the sleek side of the craft as he might have caressed a  well-loved pet.    \"Kurbi?\"    At Hobart's bark he stiffened. \"Yes, sir!\"    \"We camp here tonight. Have to make some plans.\"    \"Yes, sir.\" He agreed with that. To attempt passage of the mountains  in the dark was a suicide mission which he would have refused. On the  other hand, to his mind, they would sleep more soundly if they were  out of the city. He speculated whether he dared suggest that they use  the few remaining moments of twilight to head into the open and  establish a camp somewhere in the countryside.    The alien officer made some comment in his slurred speech and faded  away into the shadows. Raf saw that the others had already dragged out  their blanket rolls and were spreading them in the shelter of the  flitter while Soriki busied himself at the com, sending back a message  to the _RS 10_.    \"... should not be too difficult to establish a common speech form,\"  Lablet was saying as Raf climbed into the flitter to tug loose his own  roll. \"Color and pitch both seem to carry meaning. But the basic  pattern is there to study. And with the scanner to sort out those  record strips--did you adjust them, Soriki?\"    \"They're all ready for you to push the button. If the scanner can read  them, it will. I got all that speech the chief, or king, or whatever  he was, made just before we left.\"    \"Good, very good!\" In the light of the portable lamp by Soriki's com,  Lablet settled down, plugged the scanner tubes in his ears, absently  accepting a ration bar the captain handed him to chew on while he  listened to the playback of the record the com-tech had made that  afternoon.    Hobart turned to Raf. \"You went off with that officer. What did he  have to show you?\"    The pilot described the globe and the body he had been shown and then  added what he had deduced from the sketchy explanations he had been  given. The captain nodded.    \"Yes, they have aircraft, have been using them, too. But I think that  there's only one of the big ones. And they're fighting a war all  right. We didn't see the whole colony, but I'll wager that there are  only a handful of them left. They're holed up here, and they need help  or the barbarians will finish them off. They talked a lot about that.\"    Lablet pulled the ear plugs from his ears. In the lamplight there was  an excited expression on his face. \"You were entirely right, Captain!  They were offering us a bargain there at the last! They are offering  us the accumulated scientific knowledge of this world!\"    \"What?\" Hobart sounded bewildered.    \"Over there\"--Lablet made a sweep with his arm which might indicate  any point to the east--\"there is a storehouse of the original learning  of their race. It's in the heart of the enemy country. But the enemy  as yet do not know of it. They've made two trips over to bring back  material and their ship can only go once more. They offer us an equal  share if we'll make the next trip in their company and help them clean  out the storage place--\"    Hobart's answer was a whistle. There was an avid hunger on Lablet's  lean face. No more potent bribe could have been devised to entice him.  But Raf, remembering the spear-torn body, wondered.    _In the heart of the enemy country_, he repeated to himself.    Lablet added another piece of information. \"After all, the enemy they  face is only dangerous because of superior numbers. They are only  animals--\"    \"Animals don't carry spears!\" Raf protested.    \"Experimental animals that escaped during a world-wide war generations  ago,\" reported the other. \"It seems that the species have evolved to a  semi-intelligent level. I must see them!\"    Hobart was not to be hurried. \"We'll think it over,\" he decided. \"This  needs a little time for consideration.\"          7    MANY EYES, MANY EARS      This was not the first time Dalgard had faced the raging fury of a  snake-devil thirsting for a kill. The slaying he had done in the arena  was an exception to the rule, not the usual hunter's luck. And now  that he saw the creature crouched at the far end of the hall he was  ready. Sssuri, also, followed their familiar pattern, separating from  his companion and slipping along the wall toward the monster, ready to  attract its attention at the proper moment.    Only one doubt remained in Dalgard's mind. This devil had not acted in  the normal brainless fashion of its kin. What if it was able to assess  the very simple maneuvers, which always before had completely baffled  its species, and attacked not the moving merman but the waiting  archer?    It was backed against another door, a closed one, as if it had fled  for refuge to some aid it had expected and did not find. But as Sssuri  moved, its long neck straightened until it was almost at right angles  with its narrow shoulders, and from its snake's jaws proceeded a  horrific hissing which arose to a scream as its leg muscles tensed for  a spring.    At just the right moment Sssuri's arm went back, his spear sang  through the air. And the snake-devil, with an incredible twist of its  neck, caught the haft of the weapon between its teeth, crunching the  iron-hard substance into powder. But with that move it exposed its  throat, and the arrow from Dalgard's bow was buried head-deep in the  soft inner flesh.    The snake-devil spat out the spear and tried to raise its head. But  the muscles were already weakening. It fought the poison long enough  to take a single step forward, its small red eyes alight with  brainless hate. Then it crashed and lay twisting. Dalgard lowered his  bow. There was no need for a second shot.    Sssuri regarded the remains of his spear unhappily. Not only was it  the product of long hours of work, but no merman ever felt fully  equipped to face the world without such a weapon to hand. He salvaged  the barbed head and broke it free of the shred of haft the snake-devil  had left. Knotting it at his belt he turned to Dalgard.    \"Shall we see what lies beyond?\"    Dalgard crossed the hall to test the door. It did not yield to an  inward push, but rolled far enough into the wall to allow them  through.    On the other side was a room which amazed the scout. The colonists had  their laboratory, their workshops, in which they experimented and  tried to preserve the remnants of knowledge their forefathers had  brought across space, as well as to discover new. But the extent of  this storehouse with its bewildering mass of odd machines, tanks,  bales, and stocked shelves and tables, was too much to be taken in  without a careful and minute examination.    \"We are not the first to walk here.\" Sssuri had given little attention  to what was stacked about him. Instead he bent over the disturbed dust  in one aisle. Dalgard noted as he went to join the merman that there  were gaps on those tables which ran the full length of the room, lines  left in the grimy deposit of years which told of things recently  moved. And then he saw what had interested Sssuri: tracks, some  resembling those which his own bare feet might leave, except that  there were only three toes!    \"_They._\"    Dalgard who had been a hunter and a tracker before he was an explorer  crouched for a clearer view. Yes, they were recent, yet not made today  or even yesterday; there was a thin film of dust resettled in each.    \"Some days ago. They are not in the city now,\" the merman declared  with certainty. \"But they will come again.\"    \"How do you know that?\"    Sssuri's hand swept about to include the wealth around them. \"They  have taken some, perhaps to them the most needful. But they will not  be able to resist gathering the rest. Surely they will return, perhaps  not once but many times. Until--\"    \"Until they come to stay.\" Dalgard was grim as he completed that  sentence for the other.    \"That is what they will work for. This land was once under their  mastery. This world was theirs before they threw it away warring among  themselves. Yes, they dream of holding all once more. But\"--Sssuri's  yellow eyes took on some of the fire which had shone in those of"]]]
