One  day some of the people said to the man: \"That learned man makes no  impression on our minds;--what kind of a heart have you, to be thus  always in tears?\" He answered: \"I do not weep at his discourse, O  Muslims. But I had a goat of which I was very fond, and when he grew old  he died. Now, whenever the learned man speaks and wags his beard I am  reminded of my goat, for he had just such a voice and beard.\"[28] But  they are not always represented as mere dullards; for example: A miserly  old fellow once sent a Muslim preacher a gold ring without a stone,  requesting him to put up a prayer for him from the pulpit. The holy man  prayed that he should have in Paradise a golden palace without a roof.  When he descended from the pulpit, the man went to him, and, taking him  by the hand, said: \"O preacher, what manner of prayer is that thou hast  made for me?\" \"If thy ring had had a stone,\" replied the preacher, \"thy  palace should also have had a roof.\"       [28] What may be an older form of this jest is found in the          _Katha Manjari_, a Canarese collection, where a wretched          singer dwelling next door to a poor woman causes her to          weep and wail bitterly whenever he begins to sing, and          on his asking her why she wept, she explains that his          \"golden voice\" recalled to her mind her donkey that died          a month ago.--The story had found its way to our own          country more than three centuries since. In _Mery Tales          and Quicke Answeres_ (1535), under the title \"Of the          Friar that brayde in his Sermon,\" the preacher reminds a          \"poure wydowe\" of her ass--all that her husband had left          her--which had been devoured by wolves, for so the ass          was wont to bray day and night.    _Apropos_ of misers, our English facetiae books furnish many examples of  their ingenuity in excusing themselves from granting favours asked of  them by their acquaintances; and, human nature being much the same  everywhere, the misers in the East are represented as being equally  adroit, as well as witty, in parrying such objectionable requests. A  Persian who had a very miserly friend went to him one day, and said: \"I  am going on a journey; give me your ring, which I will constantly wear,  and whenever I look on it, I shall remember you.\" The other answered:  \"If you wish to remember me, whenever you see your finger _without_ my  ring upon it, always think of me, that I did not give you my ring.\" And  quite as good is the story of the dervish who said to the miser that he  wanted something of him; to which he replied: \"If you will consent to a  request of mine, I will consent to whatever else you may require\"; and  when the dervish desired to know what it was, he said: \"Never ask me for  anything and whatever else you say I will perform.\"          II    THE TWO DEAF MEN AND THE TRAVELLER--THE DEAF PERSIAN AND THE  HORSEMAN--LAZY SERVANTS--CHINESE HUMOUR: THE RICH MAN AND THE SMITHS;  HOW TO KEEP PLANTS ALIVE; CRITICISING A PORTRAIT--THE PERSIAN COURTIER  AND HIS OLD FRIEND--THE SCRIBE--THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE WIT--THE  PERSIAN AND HIS CAT--A LIST OF BLOCKHEADS--THE ARAB AND HIS CAMEL--A  WITTY BAGHDADI--THE UNLUCKY SLIPPERS.      It is well known that deaf men generally dislike having their infirmity  alluded to, and even endeavour to conceal it as much as possible.  Charles Lamb, or some other noted wit, seeing a deaf acquaintance on the  other side of the street one day while walking with a friend, stopped  and motioned to him; then opened his mouth as if speaking in a loud  tone, but saying not a word. \"What are you bawling for?\" demanded the  deaf one. \"D'ye think I can't hear?\"--Two Eastern stories I have met  with are most diverting examples of this peculiarity of deaf folks. One  is related by my friend Pandit Natesa Sastri in his _Folk-Lore of  Southern India_, of which a few copies were recently issued at  Bombay.[29] A deaf man was sitting one day where three roads crossed,  when a neatherd happened to pass that way. He had lately lost a good cow  and a calf, and had been seeking them some days. When he saw the deaf  man sitting by the way he took him for a soothsayer, and asked him to  find out by his knowledge of magic where the cow would likely be found.  The herdsman was also very deaf, and the other, without hearing what he  had said, abused him, and said he wished to be left undisturbed, at the  same time stretching out his hand and pointing at his face. This  pointing the herd supposed to indicate the direction where the lost cow  and calf should be sought; thus thinking (for he, too, had not heard a  word of what the other man had said to him), the herd went off in  search, resolving to present the soothsayer with the calf if he found it  with the cow. To his joy, and by mere chance, of course, he found them  both, and, returning with them to the deaf man (still sitting by the  wayside), he pointed to the calf and asked him to accept of it. Now, it  so happened that the calf's tail was broken and crooked, and the deaf  man supposed that the herdsman was blaming him for having broken it, and  by a wave of his hand he denied the charge. This the poor deaf neatherd  mistook for a refusal of the calf and a demand for the cow, so he said:  \"How very greedy you are, to be sure! I promised you the calf, and not  the cow.\" \"Never!\" exclaimed the deaf man in a rage. \"I know nothing of  you or your cow and calf. I never broke the calf's tail.\" While they  were thus quarrelling, without understanding each other, a third man  happened to pass, and seeing his opportunity to profit by their  deafness, he said to the neatherd in a loud voice, yet so as not to be  heard by the other deaf man: \"Friend, you had better go away with your  cow. Those soothsayers are always greedy. Leave the calf with me, and I  shall make him accept it.\" The poor neatherd, highly pleased to have  secured his cow, went off, leaving the calf with the traveller. Then  said the traveller to the deaf man: \"It is, indeed, very unlawful,  friend, for that neatherd to charge you with an offence which you did  not commit; but never mind, since you have a friend in me. I shall  contrive to make clear to him your innocence; leave this matter to me.\"  So saying, he walked away with the calf, and the deaf man went home,  well pleased that he had escaped from such a serious accusation.       [29] Messrs. W. H. Allen & Co., London, have in the press a          new edition of this work, to be entitled \"_Tales of the          Sun; or, Popular Tales of Southern India_.\" I am          confident that the collection will be highly appreciated          by many English readers, while its value to          story-comparers can hardly be over-rated.    The other story is of a deaf Persian who was taking home a quantity of  wheat, and, coming to a river which he must cross, he saw a horseman  approach; so he said to himself: \"When that horseman comes up, he will  first salute me, 'Peace be with thee'; next he will ask, 'What is the  depth of this river?' and after that he will ask, how many _mans_ of  wheat I have with me.\" (A _man_ is a Persian weight, which seems to vary  in different places.) But the deaf man's surmises were all in vain; for  when the horseman came up to him, he cried: \"Ho! my man, what is the  depth of this river?\" The deaf one replied: \"Peace be with thee, and the  mercy of Allah and his blessing.\" At this the horseman laughed, and  said: \"May they cut off thy beard!\" The deaf one rejoined: \"To my neck  and bosom.\" The horseman said: \"Dust be on thy mouth!\" The deaf man  answered: \"Eighty _mans_ of it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The laziness of domestics is a common complaint in this country at the  present day, but surely never was there a more lazy servant than the  fellow whose exploits are thus recorded: A Persian husbandman one night  desired his servant to shut the door, and the man said it was already  shut. In the morning his master bade him open the door, and he coolly  replied that, foreseeing this request, he had left it open the preceding  night. Another night his master bade him rise and see whether it rained.  But he called for the dog that lay at the door, and finding his paws  dry, answered that the night was fair; then being desired to see whether  the fire was extinguished, he called the cat, and finding her paws cold,  replied in the affirmative.--This story had gained currency in Europe in  the 13th century, and it forms one of the mediaeval _Latin Stories_  edited, for the Percy Society, by Thos. Wright, where it is entitled,  \"De Maimundo Armigero.\" There is another Persian story of a lazy fellow  whose master, being sick, said to him: \"Go and get me some medicine.\"  \"But,\" rejoined he, \"it may happen that the doctor is not at home.\" \"You  will find him at home.\" \"But if I do find him at home he may not give me  the medicine,\" quoth the servant. \"Then take this note to him and he  will give it to you.\" \"Well,\" persisted the fellow, \"he may give me the  medicine, but suppose it does you no good?\" \"Villain!\" exclaimed his  master, out of all patience, \"will you do as I bid you, instead of  sitting there so coolly, raising difficulties?\" \"Good sir,\" reasoned  this lazy philosopher, \"admitting that the medicine should produce some  effect, what will be the ultimate result? We must all die some time, and  what does it matter whether it be to-day or to-morrow?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Chinese seem not a whit behind other peoples in appreciating a good  jest, as has been shown by the tales and _bon mots_ rendered into French  by Stanislas Julien and other eminent _savans_.

And those who keep their treaty when  they make one, and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of  stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the Allah-fearing.    S: It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards the East and  the West, but righteousness is this that one should believe in Allah  and the last day and the angels and the Book and the prophets, and give  away wealth out of love for Him to the near of kin and the orphans and  the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for (the emancipation  of) the captives, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate; and the  performers of their promise when they make a promise, and the patient  in distress and affliction and in time of conflicts-- these are they  who are true (to themselves) and these are they who guard (against  evil).    002.178  Y: O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases  of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman  for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the  slain, then grant any reasonable demand, and compensate him with  handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a Mercy from your Lord.  After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty.    P: O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of  the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave,  and the female for the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by  his (injured) brother, prosecution according to usage and payment unto  him in kindness. This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He  who transgresseth after this will have a painful doom.    S: O you who believe! retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of  the slain, the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the  female for the female, but if any remission is made to any one by his  (aggrieved) brother, then prosecution (for the bloodwit) should be made  according to usage, and payment should be made to him in a good manner;  this is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy; so whoever exceeds  the limit after this he shall have a painful chastisement.    002.179  Y: In the Law of Equality there is (saving of) Life to you, O ye men of  understanding; that ye may restrain yourselves.    P: And there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding,  that ye may ward off (evil).    S: And there is life for you in (the law of) retaliation, O men of  understanding, that you may guard yourselves.    002.180  Y: It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any  goods that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to  reasonable usage; this is due from the Allah-fearing.    P: It is prescribed for you, when death approacheth one of you, if he  leave wealth, that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in  kindness. (This is) a duty for all those who ward off (evil).    S: Bequest is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you, if he  leaves behind wealth for parents and near relatives, according to  usage, a duty (incumbent) upon those who guard (against evil).    002.181  Y: If anyone changes the bequest after hearing it, the guilt shall be on  those who make the change. For Allah hears and knows all things.    P: And whoso changeth (the will) after he hath heard it - the sin  thereof is only upon those who change it. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.    S: Whoever then alters it after he has heard it, the sin of it then is  only upon those who alter it; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing.    002.182  Y: But if anyone fears partiality or wrong-doing on the part of the  testator, and makes peace between (The parties concerned), there is no  wrong in him: For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.    P: But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinful clause, and  maketh peace between the parties, (it shall be) no sin for him. Lo!  Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    S: But he who fears an inclination to a wrong course or an act of  disobedience on the part of the testator, and effects an agreement  between the parties, there is no blame on him. Surely Allah is  Forgiving, Merciful.    002.183  Y: O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed  to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint,-    P: O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was  prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off (evil);    S: O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was  prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil).    002.184  Y: (Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on  a journey, the prescribed number (Should be made up) from days later.  For those who can do it (With hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of  one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free  will,- it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if  ye only knew.    P: (Fast) a certain number of days; and (for) him who is sick among you,  or on a journey, (the same) number of other days; and for those who can  afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need - but whoso  doeth good of his own accord, it is better for him: and that ye fast is  better for you if ye did but know -    S: For a certain number of days; but whoever among you is sick or on a  journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; and those  who are not able to do it may effect a redemption by feeding a poor  man; so whoever does good spontaneously it is better for him; and that  you fast is better for you if you know.    002.185  Y: Ramadhan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur'an, as a guide  to mankind, also clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (Between right  and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during  that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a  journey, the prescribed period (Should be made up) by days later. Allah  intends every facility for you; He does not want to put to  difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to  glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be  grateful.    P: The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for  mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the Criterion (of right  and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month,  and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, (let him fast the same)  number of other days. Allah desireth for you ease; He desireth not  hardship for you; and (He desireth) that ye should complete the period,  and that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that  peradventure ye may be thankful.    S: The month of Ramazan is that in which the Quran was revealed, a  guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction;  therefore whoever of you is present in the month, he shall fast  therein, and whoever is sick or upon a journey, then (he shall fast) a  (like) number of other days; Allah desires ease for you, and He does  not desire for you difficulty, and (He desires) that you should  complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of Allah  for His having guided you and that you may give thanks.    002.186  Y: When My servants ask thee concerning Me, I am indeed close (to them):  I listen to the prayer of every suppliant when he calleth on Me: Let  them also, with a will, Listen to My call, and believe in Me: That they  may walk in the right way.    P: And when My servants question thee concerning Me, then surely I am  nigh. I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto Me. So  let them hear My call and let them trust in Me, in order that they may  be led aright.    S: And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very  near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they  should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right  way.    002.187  Y: Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your  wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth  what ye used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and  forgave you; so now associate with them, and seek what Allah Hath  ordained for you, and eat and drink, until the white thread of dawn  appear to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast  Till the night appears; but do not associate with your wives while ye  are in retreat in the mosques. Those are Limits (set by) Allah:  Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs to men:  that they may learn self-restraint.    P: It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of  the fast. They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah  is Aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath  turned in mercy toward you and relieved you. So hold intercourse with  them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you, and eat and drink  until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread  of the dawn. Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch  them not, but be at your devotions in the mosques. These are the limits  imposed by Allah, so approach them not. Thus Allah expoundeth His  revelation to mankind that they may ward off (evil).    S: It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the  fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them;  Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned  to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in  contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and  drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the  blackness of the night at dawn, then complete"]]]
