Third and fourth.--The conservators shall have the right to  inspect all wheel-races, cruives, &c., to see they are properly  regulated, and also to see that no contrivance is used to drive  the fish back. In the evidence given before the House of Commons  in 1825, it was proved that the lessee of a fishery in Scotland  used to place a crocodile painted red in the king's gap, which the  law compelled him to give from Saturday night till Monday morning.    Fifth.--The prohibition to set Eel nets in April, May, and June is  to prevent the destruction of Smolts when going down to the sea.    Seventh.--Salmon are destroyed here when spawning chiefly for the  sake of the roe. If a man were fined for selling it or having it  in his possession, this inducement would be weakened.    Eleventh.--There is the same reason for seizing the net of the  black fisher that there is for seizing the snare of the poacher,  and if the latter can be convicted for having hares or snares in  his possession, I do not see why the former should not for having  nets and Salmon.    A meeting of the gentlemen interested in the fisheries of the  Ribble and the Hodder will be held on Friday, the 17th instant,  previous to which time I should be glad of your criticism.    I am, dear Sir,  Yours very truly,  THOMAS GARNETT.    P.S.--It occurs to me since closing my letter that I have  forgotten one important provision required in any new Act of  Parliament--namely, protection to the Smolts in their downward  migration. Here the pools are swept with small meshed trammel nets  of all the fish that they contain.    * * * * *    ARTIFICIAL PROPAGATION OF FISH.    CLITHEROE, _23rd April_, 1863.    To the Editors of the \"Leeds Mercury.\"    GENTLEMEN,--I am somewhat at a loss to understand the object of  Mr. Horsfall's letter on this subject which appears in the  \"Mercury\" of to-day. If he means that fish hatched by this process  are as much at the mercy of their natural enemies as they are in  their natural spawning beds I differ from him entirely; but if he  means that there is no good in breeding migratory fish like  Salmon, when the obstacles to their return in the shape of stake  nets, impassable weirs, and poisonous waters are so numerous as  they are at present in many rivers (the Wharfe and the Aire are  examples of both), I entirely agree with him. Let us consider both  suppositions, for the more this subject is ventilated the more  likely is good to arise from the discussion. I think Mr. Horsfall  is entirely wrong in the first supposition, for the following  reasons: By artificial propagation the young fish escape all  damage from floods, and particularly ice floods, which scoop out  all the loose gravel from the spawning beds, which are frequently  entirely carried away by these floods. They escape all danger from  drought, which in some rivers is almost as bad, there being now  several mounds of dry gravel in my length of the Ribble which were  spawning grounds last December. They escape being destroyed as ova  by Trout, Eels, Bullheads, Loaches, the larva of aquatic insects,  ducks (wild and tame), water rats, and water shrews. The last are  said to be destructive to the spawn; but this I do not vouch for,  as these two last-mentioned animals have not come under my own  observation as devourers of spawn.    With regard to the 500 Salmon ova said to have been taken from the  stomach of a Trout, Ramsbottom is the authority for it, only he  says there were nearer 1,000 than 500, and he took them from the  maw of a large lake Trout at Oughterard, when netting the spawning  Salmon for his artificial propagation. When Ramsbottom was fish  breeding for Mr. Peel the year after he first went to Ireland for  that purpose, he went into the brooks at night with a light. He  never found a pair of spawning fish without also finding several  waiters on Providence in the shape of small Trout, which were  picking up the ova that descended the streams towards them.  Several of these he caught, and they were perfectly gorged with  spawn.    With regard to the ducks, Ramsbottom is again my authority. He  found that a flock of tame ducks frequented the spawning beds at  Oughterard; he bought one for the purpose of ascertaining whether  they eat spawn or not, and he found its crop quite full of spawn.  With regard to the aquatic larvae of insects, Mr. Horsfall may  easily satisfy himself that they destroy spawn if he will turn  some into an artificial spawning bed. One of my friends failed to  hatch his Trout ova because he could not keep out the fresh-water  shrimps.    Mr. Horsfall seems to think that nature would be sufficient to  take care of her own interests if man did not step in to aid her  endeavours; but if he is a sportsman he no doubt has a game-  keeper, who not only preserves the ground from poachers, but traps  cats and weasels, shoots hawks, magpies and carrion crows, breeds  tame pheasants, and generally looks to the well being of the game  without trusting to the efforts of unassisted nature.    Let us take the second supposition, that there is no good in  artificial propagation when the fish which are sent to the sea can  never come back again by reason of insurmountable obstacles. If  Mr. Horsfall means this he is quite right; there is no good in the  upper proprietors of Salmon rivers becoming brood hens for the  owners of fisheries at the mouths of rivers or the proprietors of  impassable weirs, who take all the fish which get to the foot of  these weirs. I quite agree with Mr. Horsfall that it is in most  cases easy to build practicable fish passes, and at a slight  expense, if people were willing to do so; but I wish to show that  notwithstanding the boasted effects of the Act of 1861, the upper  riparian proprietors have not a sufficient inducement to build  fish passes, and will not do so unless the expense can be made  very moderate indeed.    I will take the river Ribble to illustrate my meaning. As a  general rule we have no fresh run Salmon until May, and the upper  proprietors are supposed to have a sufficient share of the fish  that ascend the stream if the owners of the fisheries in the  estuary and the tidal part of the river cease to net from six  o'clock on the Saturday night to six o'clock on the Monday  morning. That is a day and a half per week. The fishing for Salmon  (except angling) ceases on the 31st of August, and from the 1st of  May to the 31st of August there are 123 days. Call the period  eighteen weeks, which gives us twenty-seven days during which time  the Salmon have liberty to pass to the upper parts of the river.  But on the average of seasons, owing to droughts, the rapid  absorption of moisture by vegetation, and the great evaporation,  there is no fresh water to enable the fish to ascend during two-  thirds of that time. Every one who knows anything of the habits of  Salmon is aware that they never ascend the rivers from the estuary  unless there is a fresh in the river; and, as I said before, on  the average of seasons there is no fresh for two-thirds of the  time from May to August. This reduces the twenty-seven days (which  are supposed to feed the upper proprietors with Salmon to  repletion) to nine days, and these nine days are expected to stock  the river and its tributaries for one hundred miles. It is true I  have not taken into consideration the privileges which the upper  proprietors have of angling to the 1st of November; but besides  the fact that the fish are then full of spawn, and ought not to be  killed at all, very few rise at the fly, and when they are taken  they can neither be sold nor used by any one who knows what a  fresh Salmon is. It is a greater crime against public polity to  kill a spawning Salmon than it is to steal a sheep; for, supposing  it produces 10,000 ova, and one in a hundred returns as a Salmon,  it returns from a place (the sea) where it has cost nothing in  rent, taxes, or superintendence, and, in the finest condition  imaginable, it invites us to take it.    Mr. Horsfall and I both wish for the same results (rivers swarming  with fish), and although we may somewhat differ as to details, I  have no doubt both would be glad to see public attention directed  to these matters rather more than it is at present.    If Mr. Horsfall will do me the honour to come and see me, I will  show him an efficient fish-pass which has been in operation forty  years. It may suggest some ideas to him, and he may be able to  suggest some improvements in it which I should be glad to receive.    I am, Gentlemen,  Your obedient Servant,  THOMAS GARNETT.    * * * * *    LOW MOOR, _4th January_, 1865.    DEAR SIR,--As I believe Mr. Eden, the Commissioner of Salmon  fisheries, is visiting various districts connected with Salmon  rivers in England and Wales, with a view of explaining the  proposed alterations and additions to the bill of 1861, and as I  think from what I have learnt that the proposed alterations and  additions will not be satisfactory to the upper proprietors of  Salmon rivers, I wish to call your attention to the matter, that,  if he should come into this district, the gentlemen interested may  be able to point out to him how far these alterations are from  meeting their wishes. Supposing that the new bill (as published in  the \"Field\" newspaper, and explained and commented on by Mr. Eden)  is to be understood as a government measure and one in which they  will allow of no alterations, I maintain that it is very  objectionable both from what it omits and what it purposes to do.    To begin with the former, or, in other words, to take the  recommendations of the Worcester meeting as the groundwork of new  legislation, it does not touch on several of them; they were, so  far as I remember (for I have no memoranda to refer to) an  extension of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#12)"],[1,"to Mr. J----'s.  He was at home.  I returned him the keys, told him that my  curiosity was sufficiently gratified, and was about to relate  quickly what had passed, when he stopped me, and said, though with  much politeness, that he had no longer any interest in a mystery  which none had ever solved.    I determined at least to tell him of the two letters I had read, as  well as of the extraordinary manner in which they had disappeared;  and I then inquired if he thought they had been addressed to the  woman who had died in the house, and if there were anything in her  early history which could possibly confirm the dark suspicions to  which the letters gave rise.  Mr. J---- seemed startled, and, after  musing a few moments, answered, \"I am but little acquainted with  the woman's earlier history, except as I before told you, that her  family were known to mine.  But you revive some vague reminiscences  to her prejudice.  I will make inquiries, and inform you of their  result.  Still, even if we could admit the popular superstition  that a person who had been either the perpetrator or the victim of  dark crimes in life could revisit, as a restless spirit, the scene  in which those crimes had been committed, I should observe that the  house was infested by strange sights and sounds before the old  woman died--you smile--what would you say?\"    \"I would say this, that I am convinced, if we could get to the  bottom of these mysteries, we should find a living human agency.\"    \"What! you believe it is all an imposture?  For what object?\"    \"Not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word.  If suddenly I  were to sink into a deep sleep, from which you could not awake me,  but in that sleep could answer questions with an accuracy which I  could not pretend to when awake,--tell you what money you had in  your pocket, nay, describe your very thoughts,--it is not  necessarily an imposture, any more than it is necessarily  supernatural.  I should be, unconsciously to myself, under a  mesmeric influence, conveyed to me from a distance by a human being  who had acquired power over me by previous rapport.\"    \"But if a mesmerizer could so affect another living being, can you  suppose that a mesmerizer could also affect inanimate objects: move  chairs,--open and shut doors?\"    \"Or impress our senses with the belief in such effects,--we never  having been en rapport with the person acting on us?  No.  What is  commonly called mesmerism could not do this; but there may be a  power akin to mesmerism, and superior to it,--the power that in the  old days was called Magic.  That such a power may extend to all  inanimate objects of matter, I do not say; but if so, it would not  be against Nature,--it would be only a rare power in Nature which  might be given to constitutions with certain peculiarities, and  cultivated by practice to an extraordinary degree.  That such a  power might extend over the dead,--that is, over certain thoughts  and memories that the dead may still retain,--and compel, not that  which ought properly to be called the SOUL, and which is far beyond  human reach, but rather a phantom of what has been most earth-  stained on earth, to make itself apparent to our senses, is a very  ancient though obsolete theory upon which I will hazard no opinion.  But I do not conceive the power would be supernatural.  Let me  illustrate what I mean from an experiment which Paracelsus  describes as not difficult, and which the author of the  'Curiosities of Literature' cites as credible: A flower perishes;  you burn it.  Whatever were the elements of that flower while it  lived are gone, dispersed, you know not whither; you can never  discover nor re-collect them.  But you can, by chemistry, out of  the burned dust of that flower, raise a spectrum of the flower,  just as it seemed in life.  It may be the same with the human  being.  The soul has as much escaped you as the essence or elements  of the flower.  Still you may make a spectrum of it.  And this  phantom, though in the popular superstition it is held to be the  soul of the departed, must not be confounded with the true soul; it  is but the eidolon of the dead form.  Hence, like the best-attested  stories of ghosts or spirits, the thing that most strikes us is the  absence of what we hold to be soul,--that is, of superior  emancipated intelligence.  These apparitions come for little or no  object,--they seldom speak when they do come; if they speak, they  utter no ideas above those of an ordinary person on earth.  American spirit seers have published volumes of communications, in  prose and verse, which they assert to be given in the names of the  most illustrious dead: Shakespeare, Bacon,--Heaven knows whom.  Those communications, taking the best, are certainly not a whit of  higher order than would be communications from living persons of  fair talent and education; they are wondrously inferior to what  Bacon, Shakespeare, and Plato said and wrote when on earth.  Nor,  what is more noticeable, do they ever contain an idea that was not  on the earth before.  Wonderful, therefore, as such phenomena may  be (granting them to be truthful), I see much that philosophy may  question, nothing that it is incumbent on philosophy to deny,--  namely, nothing supernatural.  They are but ideas conveyed somehow  or other (we have not yet discovered the means) from one mortal  brain to another.  Whether, in so doing, tables walk of their own  accord, or fiendlike shapes appear in a magic circle, or bodiless  hands rise and remove material objects, or a Thing of Darkness,  such as presented itself to me, freeze our blood,--still am I  persuaded that these are but agencies conveyed, as by electric  wires, to my own brain from the brain of another.  In some  constitutions there is a natural chemistry, and those constitutions  may produce chemic wonders,--in others a natural fluid, call it  electricity, and these may produce electric wonders.  But the  wonders differ from Normal Science in this,--they are alike  objectless, purposeless, puerile, frivolous.  They lead on to no  grand results; and therefore the world does not heed, and true  sages have not cultivated them.  But sure I am, that of all I saw  or heard, a man, human as myself, was the remote originator; and I  believe unconsciously to himself as to the exact effects produced,  for this reason: no two persons, you say, have ever told you that  they experienced exactly the same thing.  Well, observe, no two  persons ever experience exactly the same dream.  If this were an  ordinary imposture, the machinery would be arranged for results  that would but little vary; if it were a supernatural agency  permitted by the Almighty, it would surely be for some definite  end.  These phenomena belong to neither class; my persuasion is,  that they originate in some brain now far distant; that that brain  had no distinct volition in anything that occurred; that what does  occur reflects but its devious, motley, ever-shifting, half-formed  thoughts; in short, that it has been but the dreams of such a brain  put into action and invested with a semisubstance.  That this brain  is of immense power, that it can set matter into movement, that it  is malignant and destructive, I believe; some material force must  have killed my dog; the same force might, for aught I know, have  sufficed to kill myself, had I been as subjugated by terror as the  dog,--had my intellect or my spirit given me no countervailing  resistance in my will.\"    \"It killed your dog,--that is fearful!  Indeed it is strange that  no animal can be induced to stay in that house; not even a cat.  Rats and mice are never found in it.\"    \"The instincts of the brute creation detect influences deadly to  their existence.  Man's reason has a sense less subtle, because it  has a resisting power more supreme.  But enough; do you comprehend  my theory?\"    \"Yes, though imperfectly,--and I accept any crotchet (pardon the  word), however odd, rather than embrace at once the notion of  ghosts and hobgoblins we imbibed in our nurseries.  Still, to my  unfortunate house, the evil is the same.  What on earth can I do  with the house?\"    \"I will tell you what I would do.  I am convinced from my own  internal feelings that the small, unfurnished room at right angles  to the door of the bedroom which I occupied, forms a starting point  or receptacle for the influences which haunt the house; and I  strongly advise you to have the walls opened, the floor removed,--  nay, the whole room pulled down.  I observe that it is detached  from the body of the house, built over the small backyard, and  could be removed without injury to the rest of the building.\"    \"And you think, if I did that--\"    \"You would cut off the telegraph wires.  Try it.  I am so persuaded  that I am right, that I will pay half the expense if you will allow  me to direct the operations.\"    \"Nay, I am well able to afford the cost; for the rest allow me to  write to you.\"    About ten days after I received a letter from Mr. J---- telling me  that he had visited the house since I had seen him; that he had  found the two letters I had described, replaced in the drawer from  which I had taken them; that he had read them with misgivings like  my own; that he had instituted a cautious inquiry about the woman  to whom I rightly conjectured they had been written.  It seemed  that thirty-six years ago (a year before the date of the letters)  she had married, against the wish of her relations, an American of  very suspicions character; in fact, he was generally believed to  have been a pirate.  She herself was the daughter of very  respectable tradespeople, and had served in the capacity of a  nursery governess before her marriage.  She had a brother, a  widower, who was considered wealthy, and who had one child of about  six years old.  A month after the marriage the body of this brother  was found in the Thames, near London"]]]
