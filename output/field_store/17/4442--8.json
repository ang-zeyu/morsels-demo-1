But, at any rate, such connexions are so common, I       might almost say universal, in our slave colonies, that       except by the missionaries and a few serious persons, they       are considered, if faults at all, so very venial as scarcely       to deserve the name of immorality. Mr. Wood knows this       colonial estimate of such connexions as well as I do; and,       however false such an estimate must be allowed to be,       especially When applied to their own conduct by persons of       education, pretending to adhere to the pure Christian rule       of morals,--yet when he ascribes to a negro slave, to whom       legal marriage was denied, such great criminality for laxity       of this sort, and professes to be so exceedingly shocked and       amazed at the tale he himself relates, he must, I am       confident, have had a farther object in view than the       information of Mr. Taylor or Sir Patrick Ross. He must, it       is evident, have been aware that his letter would be sent to       Mr. Allen, and accordingly adapted it, as more important       documents from the colonies are often adapted, _for effect       in England_. The tale of the slave Molly's immoralities, be       assured, was not intended for Antigua so much as for Stoke       Newington, and Peckham, and Aldermanbury.         \"In regard to Mary's narrative generally, although I cannot       speak to the accuracy of the details, except in a few recent       particulars, I can with safety declare that I see no reason       to question the truth of a single fact stated by her, or       even to suspect her in any instance of intentional       exaggeration. It bears in my judgment the genuine stamp of       truth and nature. Such is my unhesitating opinion, after a       residence of twenty-seven years in the West Indies.         \"I remain, &c.       \"JOSEPH PHILLIPS.\"         _To T. Pringle, Esq._         \"P.S. As Mr. Wood refers to the evidence of Dr. T. Coull in       opposition to Mary's assertions, it may be proper to enable       you justly to estimate the worth of that person's evidence       in cases connected with the condition and treatment of       slaves. You are aware that in 1829, Mr. M'Queen of Glasgow,       in noticing a Report of the \"Ladies' Society of Birmingham       for the relief of British Negro Slaves,\" asserted with his       characteristic audacity, that the statement which it       contained respecting distressed and deserted slaves in       Antigua was \"an abominable falsehood.\" Not contented with       this, and with insinuating that I, as agent of the society       in the distribution of their charity in Antigua, had       fraudulently duped them out of their money by a fabricated       tale of distress, Mr. M'Queen proceeded to libel me in the       most opprobrious terms, as \"a man of the most worthless and       abandoned character.\"[20] Now I know from good authority that       it was _upon Dr. Coull's information_ that Mr. M'Queen       founded this impudent contradiction of notorious facts, and       this audacious libel of my personal character. From this       single circumstance you may judge of the value of his       evidence in the case of Mary Prince. I can furnish further       information respecting Dr. Coull's colonial proceedings,       both private and judicial, should circumstances require it.\"       \"J. P.\"         [Footnote 20: In elucidation of the circumstances above       referred to, I subjoin the following extracts from the Report       of the Birmingham Ladies' Society for 1830:--         \"As a portion of the funds of this association has been       appropriated to assist the benevolent efforts of a society       which has for fifteen years afforded relief to distressed       and deserted slaves in Antigua, it may not be uninteresting       to our friends to learn the manner in which the agent of       this society has been treated for simply obeying the command       of our Saviour, by ministering, like the good Samaritan, to       the distresses of the helpless and the desolate. The       society's proceedings being adverted to by a friend of       Africa, at one of the public meetings held in this country,       a West Indian planter, who was present, wrote over to his       friends in Antigua, and represented the conduct of the       distributors of this charity in such a light, that it was       deemed worthy of the cognizance of the House of Assembly.       Mr. Joseph Phillips, a resident of the island, who had most       kindly and disinterestedly exerted himself in the       distribution of the money from England among the poor       deserted slaves, was brought before the Assembly, and most       severely interrogated: on his refusing to deliver up his       private correspondence with his friends in England, he was       thrown into a loathsome jail, where he was kept for nearly       five months; while his loss of business, and the oppressive       proceedings instituted against him, were involving him in       poverty and ruin. On his discharge by the House of Assembly,       he was seized in their lobby for debt, and again       imprisoned.\"         \"In our report for the year 1826, we quoted a passage from       the 13th Report of the Society for the relief of deserted       Slaves in the island of Antigua, in reference to a case of       great distress. This statement fell into the hands of Mr.       M'Queen, the Editor of the Glasgow Courier. Of the       consequences resulting from this circumstance we only gained       information through the Leicester Chronicle, which had       copied an article from the Weekly Register of Antigua, dated       St. John's, September 22, 1829. We find from this that Mr.       M'Queen affirms, that 'with the exception of the fact that       the society is, as it deserves to be, duped out of its       money, the whole tale' (of the distress above referred to)       'is an abominable falsehood.' This statement, which we are       informed has appeared in many of the public papers, is       COMPLETELY REFUTED in our Appendix, No. 4, to which       we refer our readers. Mr. M'Queen's statements, we regret to       say, would lead many to believe that there are no deserted       Negroes to assist; and that the case mentioned was a perfect       fabrication. He also distinctly avers, that the       disinterested and humane agent of the society, Mr. Joseph       Phillips, is 'a man of the most worthless and abandoned       character.' In opposition to this statement, we learn the       good character of Mr. Phillips from those who have long been       acquainted with his laudable exertions in the cause of       humanity, and from the Editor of the Weekly Register of       Antigua, who speaks, on his own knowledge, of more than       twenty years back; confidently appealing at the same time to       the inhabitants of the colony in which he resides for the       truth of his averments, and producing a testimonial to Mr.       Phillips's good character signed by two members of the       Antigua House of Assembly, and by Mr. Wyke, the collector of       his Majesty's customs, and by Antigua merchants, as       follows--'that they have been acquainted with him the last       four years and upwards, and he has always conducted himself       in an upright becoming manner--his character we know to be       unimpeached, and his morals unexceptionable.'                  (Signed)  \"Thomas Saunderson   John D. Taylor                           John A. Wood        George Wyke                           Samuel L. Darrel     Giles S. Musson                                   Robert Grant.\"         \"St. John's, Antigua, June 28, 1825.\"    In addition to the above testimonies, Mr. Phillips has brought over to  England with him others of a more recent date, from some of the most  respectable persons in Antigua--sufficient to cover with confusion all his  unprincipled calumniators. See also his account of his own case in the  Anti-Slavery Reporter, No. 74, p. 69.]    I leave the preceding letter to be candidly weighed by the reader in  opposition to the inculpatory allegations of Mr. Wood--merely remarking  that Mr. Wood will find it somewhat difficult to impugn the evidence of  Mr. Phillips, whose \"upright,\" \"unimpeached,\" and \"unexceptionable\"  character, he has himself vouched for in unqualified terms, by affixing  his signature to the testimonial published in the Weekly Register of  Antigua in 1825. (See Note below.)    The next testimony in Mary's behalf is that of Mrs. Forsyth, a lady in  whose service she spent the summer of 1829.--(See page 21.) This lady, on  leaving London to join her husband, voluntarily presented Mary with a  certificate, which, though it relates only to a recent and short period of  her history, is a strong corroboration of the habitual respectability of  her character. It is in the following terms:--         \"Mrs. Forsyth states, that the bearer of this paper (Mary       James,) has been with her for the last six months; that she       has found her an excellent character, being honest,       industrious, and sober; and that she parts with her on no       other account than this--that being obliged to travel with       her husband, who has lately come from abroad in bad health,       she has no farther need of a servant. Any person Wishing to       engage her, can have her character in full from Miss Robson,       4, Keppel Street, Russel Square, whom Mrs. Forsyth has       requested to furnish particulars to any one desiring them.         \"4, Keppel Street, 28th Sept. 1829.\"    In the last place, I add my own testimony in behalf of this negro woman.  Independently of the scrutiny, which, as Secretary of the Anti-Slavery  Society, I made into her case when she first applied for assistance, at  18, Aldermanbury, and the watchful eye I kept upon her conduct"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17860"],[0,"Stories from Hans Andersen (#12)"],[1,"outspread. Yes, indeed, it seemed so, but when the Prince touched  them he saw that they were not birds but plants. They were big dock  leaves, which shone like peacocks' tails. Lions and tigers sprang like  agile cats among the green hedges, which were scented with the blossom  of the olive, and the lion and the tiger were tame. The wild dove,  glistening like a pearl, beat the lion's mane with his wings; and the  antelope, otherwise so shy, stood by nodding, just as if he wanted to  join the game.    The Fairy of the Garden now advanced to meet them; her garments shone  like the sun, and her face beamed like that of a happy mother rejoicing  over her child. She was young and very beautiful, and was surrounded by  a band of lovely girls, each with a gleaming star in her hair.    When the Eastwind gave her the inscribed leaf from the Phoenix her  eyes sparkled with delight. She took the Prince's hand and led him into  her palace, where the walls were the colour of the brightest tulips in  the sunlight. The ceiling was one great shining flower, and the longer  one gazed into it the deeper the calyx seemed to be. The Prince went to  the window, and looking through one of the panes saw the Tree of  Knowledge, with the Serpent, and Adam and Eve standing by.    'Are they not driven out?' he asked, and the Fairy smiled, and explained  that Time had burned a picture into each pane, but not of the kind one  usually sees; they were alive, the leaves on the trees moved, and people  came and went like the reflections in a mirror.    Then he looked through another pane, and he saw Jacob's dream, with the  ladder going straight up into heaven, and angels with great wings were  fluttering up and down. All that had ever happened in this world lived  and moved on these window panes; only Time could imprint such wonderful  pictures.    [Illustration: _The Fairy of the Garden now advanced to meet them; her  garments shone like the sun, and her face beamed like that of a happy  mother rejoicing over her child._]    The Fairy smiled and led him into a large, lofty room, the walls of  which were like transparent paintings of faces, one more beautiful than  the other. These were millions of the Blessed who smiled and sang, and  all their songs melted into one perfect melody. The highest ones were so  tiny that they seemed smaller than the very smallest rosebud, no bigger  than a pinpoint in a drawing. In the middle of the room stood a large  tree, with handsome drooping branches; golden apples, large and small,  hung like oranges among its green leaves. It was the Tree of  Knowledge, of whose fruit Adam and Eve had eaten. From every leaf  hung a shining red drop of dew; it was as if the tree wept tears of  blood.    'Now let us get into the boat,' said the Fairy. 'We shall find  refreshment on the swelling waters. The boat rocks, but it does not move  from the spot; all the countries of the world will pass before our  eyes.'    It was a curious sight to see the whole coast move. Here came lofty  snow-clad Alps, with their clouds and dark fir trees. The horn echoed  sadly among them, and the shepherd yodelled sweetly in the valleys. Then  banian trees bent their long drooping branches over the boat, black  swans floated on the water, and the strangest animals and flowers  appeared on the shore. This was New Holland, the fifth portion of the  world, which glided past them with a view of its blue mountains. They  heard the song of priests, and saw the dances of the savages to the  sound of drums and pipes of bone. The pyramids of Egypt reaching to the  clouds, with fallen columns, and Sphynxes half buried in sand, next  sailed past them. Then came the Aurora Borealis blazing over the peaks  of the north; they were fireworks which could not be imitated. The  Prince was so happy, and he saw a hundred times more than we have  described.    'Can I stay here always?' he asked.    'That depends upon yourself,' answered the Fairy. 'If you do not, like  Adam, allow yourself to be tempted to do what is forbidden, you can stay  here always.'    'I will not touch the apples on the Tree of Knowledge,' said the Prince.  'There are thousands of other fruits here as beautiful.'    'Test yourself, and if you are not strong enough, go back with the  Eastwind who brought you. He is going away now, and will not come back  for a hundred years; the time will fly in this place like a hundred  hours, but that is a long time for temptation and sin. Every evening  when I leave you I must say, \"Come with me,\" and I must beckon to you,  but stay behind. Do not come with me, for with every step you take your  longing will grow stronger. You will reach the hall where grows the Tree  of Knowledge; I sleep beneath its fragrant drooping branches. You will  bend over me and I must smile, but if you press a kiss upon my lips  Paradise will sink deep down into the earth, and it will be lost to you.  The sharp winds of the wilderness will whistle round you, the cold rain  will drop from your hair. Sorrow and labour will be your lot.'    'I will remain here!' said the Prince.    And the Eastwind kissed him on the mouth and said: 'Be strong, then we  shall meet again in a hundred years. Farewell! Farewell!' And the  Eastwind spread his great wings; they shone like poppies at the harvest  time, or the Northern Lights in a cold winter.    'Good-bye! good-bye!' whispered the flowers. Storks and pelicans flew  in a line like waving ribbons, conducting him to the boundaries of the  Garden.    'Now we begin our dancing!' said the Fairy; 'at the end when I dance  with you, as the sun goes down you will see me beckon to you and cry,  \"Come with me\", but do not come. I have to repeat it every night for a  hundred years. Every time you resist, you will grow stronger, and at  last you will not even think of following. To-night is the first time.  Remember my warning!'    And the Fairy led him into a large hall of white transparent lilies, the  yellow stamens in each formed a little golden harp which echoed the  sound of strings and flutes. Lovely girls, slender and lissom, dressed  in floating gauze, which revealed their exquisite limbs, glided in the  dance, and sang of the joy of living--that they would never die--and  that the Garden of Paradise would bloom for ever.    The sun went down and the sky was bathed in golden light which gave the  lilies the effect of roses; and the Prince drank of the foaming wine  handed to him by the maidens. He felt such joy as he had never known  before; he saw the background of the hall opening where the Tree of  Knowledge stood in a radiancy which blinded him. The song proceeding  from it was soft and lovely, like his mother's voice, and she seemed to  say, 'My child, my beloved child!'    Then the Fairy beckoned to him and said so tenderly, 'Come with me,'  that he rushed towards her, forgetting his promise, forgetting  everything on the very first evening that she smiled and beckoned to  him.    The fragrance in the scented air around grew stronger, the harps sounded  sweeter than ever, and it seemed as if the millions of smiling heads in  the hall where the Tree grew nodded and sang, 'One must know everything.  Man is lord of the earth.' They were no longer tears of blood which fell  from the Tree; it seemed to him that they were red shining stars.    'Come with me, come with me,' spoke those trembling tones, and at every  step the Prince's cheeks burnt hotter and hotter and his blood coursed  more rapidly.    'I must go,' he said, 'it is no sin; I must see her asleep; nothing will  be lost if I do not kiss her, and that I will not do. My will is  strong.'    The Fairy dropped her shimmering garment, drew back the branches, and a  moment after was hidden within their depths.    'I have not sinned yet!' said the Prince, 'nor will I'; then he drew  back the branches. There she lay asleep already, beautiful as only the  Fairy in the Garden of Paradise can be. She smiled in her dreams; he  bent over her and saw the tears welling up under her eyelashes.    [Illustration: _The Fairy dropped her shimmering garment, drew back the  branches, and a moment after was hidden within their depths._]    'Do you weep for me?' he whispered. 'Weep not, beautiful maiden. I  only now understand the full bliss of Paradise; it surges through my  blood and through my thoughts. I feel the strength of the angels and of  everlasting life in my mortal limbs! If it were to be everlasting night  to me, a moment like this were worth it!' and he kissed away the tears  from her eyes; his mouth touched hers.    Then came a sound like thunder, louder and more awful than any he had  ever heard before, and everything around collapsed. The beautiful Fairy,  the flowery Paradise sank deeper and deeper. The Prince saw it sink into  the darkness of night; it shone far off like a little tiny twinkling  star. The chill of death crept over his limbs; he closed his eyes and  lay long as if dead.    The cold rain fell on his face, and the sharp wind blew around his head,  and at last his memory came back. 'What have I done?' he sighed. 'I have  sinned like Adam, sinned so heavily that Paradise has sunk low beneath  the earth!' And he opened his eyes; he could still see the star, the  far-away star, which twinkled like Paradise; it was the morning star in  the sky. He got up and found himself in the wood near the cave of the  winds, and the mother of the winds sat by his side. She looked angry and  raised her hand.    'So soon as the first evening!' she said. 'I thought as much; if you  were my boy, you should go into the bag!'    'Ah, he shall soon go there!' said Death. He was a strong old man, with  a scythe in his hand and great black wings. 'He shall be laid in a  coffin, but not now; I only mark him and then leave him for a time to  wander about on the earth to expiate his sin and to grow better. I will  come some time. When he least expects me, I shall come back, lay him in  a"]]]
