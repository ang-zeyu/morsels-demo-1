For by simply placing one of these  instruments near the piano it will be possible hereafter to preserve  every note and every accent and shade of expression, and reproduce it  subsequently at will. And not only will momentary inspirations be thus  preserved, but musicians will no longer be compelled to do all the  manual labor of writing down their compositions, but will be able to  follow the example of those German professors, who when they wish to  write a book, simply engage a stenographer to take down their  lectures, which they then revise and forward to the publisher. True,  the orchestration will always have to be done by the master's own  hands, but in other respects musicians of the future will be as  greatly benefited as men of letters by the new phonograph which, it is  predicted, will create as great a revolution in social affairs as the  telegraph and railroad did when first introduced.    The charm of improvisation lies, of course, in this, that we hear a  composer creating and playing at the same time. This very fact,  however, ought to make us cautious not to overestimate the value of  such improvisations. For we all know how a great genius can invest  even a commonplace idea with charm by his manner of expressing or  rendering it. It is probable, therefore, that in most cases these  improvisations, if noted down and played by _others_, would not make  as deep an impression as the regularly written compositions of the  great masters. It is with music as with literature. Schopenhauer says  that there are three classes of writers: The first class, which is  very numerous, never think at all, but simply reproduce echoes of what  they have read in books. The second class, somewhat less numerous,  think only while they are writing. But the third class, which is very  small, only write _after_ thinking and because their thoughts clamor  for utterance.    If we apply this classification to music we see at once that  improvising comes under the second head: improvising is thinking or  composing while playing. But the greatest musical ideas are those  which are conceived entirely in the mind, which needs no pen or piano  mechanically to stimulate its creative power. Of this there can be no  question, whatever. With an almost absolute unanimity we find that the  greatest composers conceived their immortal ideas in the open air,  where there was no possibility of coaxing them out of an instrument.  And not only is the bare outline thus composed mentally, but the whole  composition with all its involved harmonies and varied orchestral  colors is present in the composer's mind before he puts it down on  paper. The composition of \"Der Freischuetz\" affords a remarkable  confirmation of this statement. Weber began to compose this opera  mentally on February 23, but did not write down a single note before  the second of July. That is, he kept the full score of this wonderful  work in his brain for more than four months, and, as his son remarks,  \"there is not a number in it which he did not work over ten times in  his mind, until it sounded satisfactory and he could say to himself  'That's it,' and then he wrote it down rapidly without hesitation and  almost without altering a note.\"    This power of elaborating a musical score in the mind, and hearing it  inwardly, is a gift which unmusical people find it difficult to  comprehend, and which even puzzles many musical people. Yet it is a  power which all students of music ought to possess; and, like other  capacities, it can be easily cultivated and strengthened.    A comparison with two other senses will throw some light on the  matter. Most of us can, by thinking fixedly of some appetizing dish,  recall its flavor sufficiently to start a nerve current and stimulate  the salivary glands. The image of the flavor, so to speak, makes the  mouth water. What do we do when we go to a restaurant and look over  the bill of fare? We simply, on reading the list, recall a faint  gastronomic image, as it were, of each dish, and the one which is most  vivid, owing to the peculiar direction of the appetite, decides our  choice.    The sense of sight presents many curious analogies. Mr. Galton, in his  \"Inquiries into Human Faculty,\" gives the results of a series of  investigations which show that there are great differences among  persons of distinction in various kinds of intellectual work in the  power of recalling to the mind's eye clear and distinct images of what  they have seen. Some, for instance, in thinking of the breakfast  table, could see all the objects--knives, plates, dishes, etc., in the  mental picture as bright as in the actual scene, and in the  appropriate colors; others could recall only very dim or blurred  images of the scene, or none at all; and all stages, from the highest  to the lowest visualizing power, were represented in the letters he  received on the subject.    Sometimes these mental images are as vivid as the actual images, or  even more vivid. Everybody has heard the story of Blake, who, when he  was painting a portrait, only required one sitting, because  subsequently he could see the model as distinctly as if he were  actually sitting in the chair. Mrs. Haweis wrote to Mr. Galton that  all her life she has had at times a waking vision of \"a flight of pink  roses floating in a mass from right to left,\" and that before her  ninth year they were so large and brilliant that she often tried to  touch them; and their scent, she adds, was overpowering.    Much has been written regarding the remarkable feats of Zuckertort and  Blackburn who can play as many as sixteen to twenty games of chess at  once, and blindfolded. Of course the only way they can do this is by  having in the mind a clear picture of each chess-board, with all the  figures arranged in proper order.    Mr. Galton says he has among his notes \"many cases of persons mentally  reading off scores when playing the pianoforte, or manuscripts when  they are making speeches;\" and he knows a lady, the daughter of an  eminent musician, who often imagines she hears her father's playing.  \"The day she told me of it,\" he says, \"the incident had again  occurred. She was sitting in her room with her maid, and she asked the  maid to open the door that she might hear the music better. The moment  the maid got up the music disappeared.\"    It is obvious that this case, like that of the eminent painter just  referred to, borders closely on the hallucinations of the insane, and  Blake _did_ become insane subsequently. But usually there is nothing  abnormal or pathologic in the power of mentally recalling sights or  sounds, and it would be well if everybody cultivated this power. Mr.  Galton mentions an electrical engineer who was able to recall forms  with great precision, but not color. But after some exercise of his  color memory he became quite an adept in that, too, and declared that  the newly-acquired power was a source of much pleasure to him.    In music most of us have the power of recalling a simple melody; and  who has not been tormented at times by an unbidden melody persistently  haunting his ears until he was almost ready to commit suicide? But to  recall a melody at will _with any particular tone-color_, _i.e._, to  imagine it as being played by a flute, or a violin, or a horn, is much  less easy; and still more difficult is it to hear two or more notes  _at once_ in the mind, that is to recall harmonies. It is for this  reason that people of primitive musical taste care only for operas  which are full of \"tunes.\" These they can whistle in the street and be  happy, while the harmonies and orchestral colors elude their  comprehension and memory. Consequently they call these works \"heavy,\"  \"scientific,\" or \"intellectual;\" whereas if they took pains to educate  their musical imaginations, they would soon revel in the magic  harmonies of modern operas, with their infinite variety of gorgeous  orchestral colors.    Every student of music should carefully heed Schumann's advice.  \"Exercise your imagination,\" he says, \"so that you may acquire the  power of remembering not only the melody of a composition, but also  the harmonies which accompany it.\" And again he says, \"You must not  rest until you are able to understand music on paper.\" I remember  that, as a small boy, I used to wonder at my father, who often sat in  a corner all the evening looking over the score of an opera or  symphony. And I was very much surprised at the time when he informed  me that this simple reading of the score gave him almost as vivid a  pleasure as if he heard it with full orchestra. This power of hearing  music with the eyes, as it were, is common to all thorough musicians,  and is, of course, most highly developed in the great composers.  Schumann even alludes to the opinion, which some one had expressed,  that a thorough musician ought to be able, on listening for the first  time to a complicated orchestral piece, to _see_ it bodily as a score  before his eyes. He adds, however, that this is the greatest feat that  could be imagined; and I, for my part, doubt whether even the  marvellously comprehensive mind of a musical genius would be able to  accomplish it.    These facts illustrate the manner in which composers, being virtuosi  of the musical imagination, are able to elaborate mentally, and keep  in the memory, a complete operatic or symphonic score, just as, for  example, Alexander Dumas, when he wished to write a new novel, used to  hire a yacht and sail on Southern waters for several days, lying on  his back--which, by the way, is an excellent method of starting a  train of thought--and thus arranging all the details of the plot in  his mind.    The exact way in which _original_ ideas come into the mind is, of  course, a mystery in music as in literature. Every genius passes  through a period of apprenticeship, in which he _assimilates_ "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#12)"],[1,"=--It might perhaps be thought that the organisation  of religion is a matter remote from its spirit, and is not therefore a  suitable subject for discussion, where the object is rather to bring  out underlying motives and ideas: but in dealing with the Roman  religion, where ceremonial and legal precision were so prominent, it  would be even misleading to omit some reference to the very  characteristic manner in which the state, taking over the rather  chaotic elements of the agricultural worship, organised them into  something like a consistent whole. Its most complete achievement in  this direction was without doubt the regulation of the religious year.  We have spoken many times of the Calendars (_Fasti_): it is necessary  now to obtain some clearer notion of what they were. In Rome itself and  various Italian towns have been found some thirty inscriptions, one  almost complete (Maffeiani), the others more or less fragmentary,  giving the tables of the months and marking precisely the character and  occurrences of every day in the year. We may take as a specimen the  latter half of the month of August from the Fasti Maffeiani.    A. EID. [NP].       |   C. VOLC. [NP].  B. F.               |   D. C.  C. C.               |   E. OPIC. [NP].  D. C.               |   F. C.  E. PORT. [NP].      |   G. VOLT. [NP].  F. C.               |   H. [NP].  G. VIN. F.P.        |   A. F.  H. C.               |   B. F.  A. CONS. [NP].      |   C. C.  B. EN.              |    In the first column are given the nundinal letters of the days, showing  their position in the eight days' 'week' from one market day  (_nundinae_) to the next. In the second column are noted first the  great divisions of the month, Calends, Nones, and Ides, and then the  religious character of each individual day is indicated by certain  signs, whose explanations throw a good deal of light on Roman religions  notions. It will be seen that the letters of most frequent occurrence  are F, C, and N (or in our extract [NP]): these correspond to the broad  distinction between days profane and sacred. F (_fastus_) denotes a  day on which the business of the state may be performed, on which the  praetor may say (_fari_) the three words, _do_, _dico_, _addico_, which  summed up the decisions of the Roman law: C (_comitialis_) marks a day  on which the legislative assemblies (_comitia_) may be held: it is by  implication F as well. N (_nefastus_), on the other hand, denotes the  sacred day, consecrated to the worship of the gods, on which therefore  state-business may not be transacted: similarly the very mysterious and  much disputed sign [NP], whether it differs in precise signification  from N or not, certainly marks a day of sacred character. EN, which  occurs once in this extract (from _endotercisus_, the old Latin form of  _intercisus_) signifies a 'split' day (_dies fissus_), the beginning  and end of which were sacred, while the middle period was free for  business. In the second column also (in large letters in some of the  other Calendars) are named the _feriae publicae_, the great annual  state-festivals, fixed for one particular day (_feriae stativae_):  such, in this case, are the Portunalia, Vinalia, and Consualia.    These _fasti_ were exhibited in the Forum and on the walls of temples,  and the conscientious Roman could have no possible difficulty in  finding out when he might lawfully transact his business and what  festivals the state was observing: of the 355 days of the old Calendar  11 were _fissi_, 235 were _fasti_ (192 _comitiales_), and 109  _nefasti_. We may remark as curious features in the Calendar, denoting  rigid adherence to principle, that with one exception, the Poplifugia  of July 5, no festival ever occurs before the Nones, that with two  exceptions, the Regifugium of February 24 and the Equirria of the 14th  of March, no festival falls on an even day of the month, and that there  is a marked avoidance of successive feast-days: even the three days of  the Lemuria allow an interval of a day between each.    In the matter of ritual and observance, state-organisation--and its  absence--are alike significant. Of the general exactness of ritual and  its specific variations on different occasions a fair notion has  perhaps already been gathered; it may help to fill out that notion if  we can put together a sketch of the normal process of a sacrifice to  the gods. Before the sacrifice began the animal to be offered was  selected and tested: if it had any blemish or showed any reluctance, it  was rejected. If it were whole and willing, it was bound with fillets  (_infulae_) around its forehead, and long ribbons (_vittae_) depending  from them. It was then brought to the altar (_ara_) by the side of  which stood a portable brazier (_foculus_). The celebrant--magistrate  or priest--next approached dressed in the _toga_, girt about him in a  peculiar manner (_cinctus Gabinus_), and carried up at the back so as  to form a hood (_velato capite_): the herald proclaimed silence, and  the flute-player began to play his instrument. The first part of the  offering was then made by the pouring of wine and scattering of incense  on the brazier: it was followed by the ceremonial slaughter  (_immolatio_) of the animal. The celebrant sprinkled the victim with  wine and salted cake, and made a symbolic gesture with the knife. The  victim was then taken aside by the attendants (_victimarii_), and  actually slaughtered by them: from it they extracted the sacred parts  (_exta_), liver, heart, gall, lungs, and midriff, and after inspecting  them to see that they had no abnormality--but not in the earlier period  for purposes of augury--wrapped them in pieces of flesh (_augmenta_),  cooked them, and brought them back to the celebrant, who laid them as  an offering upon the altar, where they were burnt. The rest of the  flesh (_viscera_) was divided as a sacred meal between the celebrant  and his friends--or in a state-offering among the priests, and  probably the magistrate. We cannot refrain from remarking here the  extreme precision of ritual, the scrupulous care with which the human  side of the contract was fulfilled and the--almost legal--division of  the victim between gods and men. But though the ritual was so exact,  one must not be led away by modern analogies to suppose that there was  ever anything like a rigid constraint on the private citizen for the  observance of festivals. The state-festivals were in the strictest  sense offerings made to the gods by the representative magistrates or  priests, and if they were present, all was done that was required: the  whole people had been, by a legal fiction, present in their persons. No  doubt the private citizen would often attend in large numbers at the  celebrations, especially at the more popular festivals, but from some,  such as the Vestalia, he was actually excluded. On the other hand,  though it did not demand presence, the state did--at least  theoretically--demand the observance of the feast-day by private  individuals. The root-notion of _feriae_ was a day set apart for the  worship of the gods, and on it therefore the citizen ought to do 'no  manner of work.' The state observed this condition fully in the  closing of law-courts and the absence of legislative assemblies, and  in theory too the private citizen must refrain from any act which was  not concerned with the worship of the gods, or rendered absolutely  necessary, as, for instance, if 'his ox or his ass should fall into a  pit.' But it is characteristic of Rome that the state did not seek for  offence, but only punished it if accidentally seen: on a feast-day the  _rex sacrorum_ and the _flamines_ might not see work being done; they  therefore sent on a herald in advance to announce their presence, and  an actual conviction involved a money-fine. Perhaps more scrupulously  than the _feriae_ were observed the _dies religiosi_, days of  'abstinence,' on which certain acts, such as marriage, the beginning of  any new piece of work, or the offering of sacrifice to the gods, were  forbidden: such, in the oldest period, were the days on which the  _mundus_ was open, or the temple of Vesta received the matrons, the  days when the Salii carried the _ancilia_ in procession, and the  periods of the two festivals of the dead in February and May; but for  eluding their observance too devices were not unknown.    In the state-organisation of religion, then, we seem to see just the  same features from which we started: as a basis the legal conception  of the relation of god to man, as a result the extreme care and  precision in times and ceremonials, as a corollary in the state the  idea of legal representation and the consequent looseness of hold on  the action of the individual.          CHAPTER VIII    AUGURIES AND AUSPICES      So far we have been considering the regular relations of man and god,  seen in recurring or special offerings, in vows and in acts of  purification and lustration--all based on the contract-notion, all  endeavours on man's part to fulfil his bounden duty, that the gods may  be constrained in turn to theirs. But so strong was the feeling of  divine presence and influence in the Roman's mind, that he was not  content with doing his best by these regular means to secure the favour  of the gods, but wished before undertaking any business of importance  to be able to assure himself of their approval. His practical  common-sense evolved, as it were, a complete 'code'--in the flight and  song of birds, in the direction of the lightning-flash, in the conduct  of men and animals--by which he believed that the gods communicated to  him their intentions: sometimes these indications (_auspicia_) might be  vouchsafed by the gods unasked (_oblativa_), sometimes they would be  given in answer to request (_impetrativa_): but as to their meaning,  there could be no doubt, provided they were interpreted by one skilled  in the lore and "]]]
