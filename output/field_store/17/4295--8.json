But all this had  disappeared and would never return. These were the times of peace, work  and abundance.    \"Just think of it, Frenchy,\" he said, driving away the mosquitoes with  the puffs of his cigar. \"I am Spanish, you French, Karl German, my  daughters Argentinians, the cook Russian, his assistant Greek, the  stable boy English, the kitchen servants Chinas (natives), Galicians or  Italians, and among the peons there are many castes and laws. . . . And  yet we all live in peace. In Europe, we would have probably been in a  grand fight by this time, but here we are all friends.\"    He took much pleasure in listening to the music of the laborers--laments  from Italian songs to the accompaniment of the accordion, Spanish  guitars and Creole choruses, wild voices chanting of love and death.    \"This is a regular Noah's ark,\" exulted the vainglorious patriarch.    \"He means the tower of Babel,\" thought Desnoyers to himself, \"but it's  all the same thing to the old man.\"    \"I believe,\" he rambled on, \"that we live thus because in this part  of the world there are no kings and a very small army--and mankind is  thinking only of enjoying itself as much as possible, thanks to its  work. But I also believe that we live so peacefully because there is  such abundance that everyone gets his share. . . . How quickly we would  spring to arms if the rations were less than the people!\"    Again he fell into reflective silence, shortly after announcing the  result of his meditations.    \"Be that as it may be, we must recognize that here life is more tranquil  than in the other world. Men are taken for what they are worth, and  mingle together without thinking whether they came from one country or  another. Over here, fellows do not come in droves to kill other fellows  whom they do not know and whose only crime is that they were born in an  unfriendly country. . . . Man is a bad beast everywhere, I know that;  but here he eats, owns more land than he needs so that he can stretch  himself, and he is good with the goodness of a well-fed dog. Over there,  there are too many; they live in heaps getting in each other's way, and  easily run amuck. Hurrah for Peace, Frenchy, and the simple life! Where  a man can live comfortably and runs no danger of being killed for things  he doesn't understand--there is his real homeland!\"    And as though an echo of the rustic's reflections, Karl seated at the  piano, began chanting in a low voice one of Beethoven's hymns--         \"We sing the joy of life,            We sing of liberty,       We'll ne'er betray our fellow-man,            Though great the guerdon be.\"    Peace! . . . A few days afterward Desnoyers recalled bitterly the old  man's illusion, for war--domestic war--broke loose in this idyllic  stage-setting of ranch life.    \"Run, Senor Manager, the old Patron has unsheathed his knife and is  going to kill the German!\" And Desnoyers had hurried from his office,  warned by the peon's summons. Madariaga was chasing Karl, knife in hand,  stumbling over everything that blocked his way. Only his son-in-law  dared to stop him and disarm him.    \"That shameless pedigreed fellow!\" bellowed the livid old man as he  writhed in Desnoyers' firm clutch. \"Half famished, all he thinks he has  to do is to come to my house and take away my daughters and dollars.  . . . Let me go, I tell you! Let me loose that I may kill him.\"    And in order to free himself from Desnoyers, he tried further to explain  the difficulty. He had accepted the Frenchman as a husband for his  daughter because he was to his liking, modest, honest . . . and serious.  But this singing Pedigreed Fellow, with all his airs! . . . He was a man  that he had gotten from . . . well, he didn't wish to say just where!  And the Frenchman, though knowing perfectly well what his introduction  to Karl had been, pretended not to understand him.    As the German had, by this time, made good his escape, the ranchman  consented to being pushed toward his house, talking all the time about  giving a beating to the Romantica and another to the China for not  having informed him of the courtship. He had surprised his daughter  and the Gringo holding hands and exchanging kisses in a grove near the  house.    \"He's after my dollars,\" howled the irate father. \"He wants America to  enrich him quickly at the expense of the old Spaniard, and that is  the reason for so much truckling, so much psalm-singing and so much  nobility! Imposter! . . . Musician!\"    And he repeated the word \"musician\" with contempt, as though it were the  sum and substance of everything vile.    Very firmly and with few words, Desnoyers brought the wrangling to an  end. While her brother-in-law protected her retreat, the Romantica,  clinging to her mother, had taken refuge in the top of the house,  sobbing and moaning, \"Oh, the poor little fellow! Everybody against  him!\" Her sister meanwhile was exerting all the powers of a discreet  daughter with the rampageous old man in the office, and Desnoyers had  gone in search of Karl. Finding that he had not yet recovered from the  shock of his terrible surprise, he gave him a horse, advising him to  betake himself as quickly as possible to the nearest railway station.    Although the German was soon far from the ranch, he did not long remain  alone. In a few days, the Romantica followed him. . . . Iseult of the  white hands went in search of Tristan, the knight.    This event did not cause Madariaga's desperation to break out as  violently as his son-in-law had expected. For the first time, he saw him  weep. His gay and robust old age had suddenly fallen from him, the news  having clapped ten years on to his four score. Like a child, whimpering  and tremulous, he threw his arms around Desnoyers, moistening his neck  with tears.    \"He has taken her away! That son of a great flea . . . has taken her  away!\"    This time he did not lay all the blame on his China. He wept with her,  and as if trying to console her by a public confession, kept saying over  and over:    \"It is my fault. . . . It has all been because of my very, very great  sins.\"    Now began for Desnoyers a period of difficulties and conflicts. The  fugitives, on one of his visits to the Capital, threw themselves on his  mercy, imploring his protection. The Romantica wept, declaring that only  her brother-in-law, \"the most knightly man in the world,\" could save  her. Karl gazed at him like a faithful hound trusting in his master.  These trying interviews were repeated on all his trips. Then, on  returning to the ranch, he would find the old man ill-humored, moody,  looking fixedly ahead of him as though seeing invisible power and  wailing, \"It is my punishment--the punishment for my sins.\"    The memory of the discreditable circumstances under which he had made  Karl's acquaintance, before bringing him into his home, tormented  the old centaur with remorse. Some afternoons, he would have a horse  saddled, going full gallop toward the neighboring village. But he was  no longer hunting hospitable ranches. He needed to pass some time in  the church, speaking alone with the images that were there only for  him--since he had footed the bills for them. . . . \"Through my sin,  through my very great sin!\"    But in spite of his self-reproach, Desnoyers had to work very hard  to get any kind of a settlement out of the old penitent. Whenever he  suggested legalizing the situation and making the necessary arrangements  for their marriage, the old tyrant would not let him go on. \"Do what you  think best, but don't say anything to me about it.\"    Several months passed by. One day the Frenchman approached him with a  certain air of mystery. \"Elena has a son and has named him 'Julio' after  you.\"    \"And you, you great useless hulk,\" stormed the ranchman, \"and that weak  cow of a wife of yours, you dare to live tranquilly on without giving  me a grandson! . . . Ah, Frenchy, that is why the Germans will finally  overwhelm you. You see it, right here. That bandit has a son, while you,  after four years of marriage . . . nothing. I want a grandson!--do you  understand THAT?\"    And in order to console himself for this lack of little ones around his  own hearth, he betook himself to the ranch of his overseer, Celedonio,  where a band of little half-breeds gathered tremblingly and hopefully  about him.    Suddenly China died. The poor Misia Petrona passed away as discreetly as  she had lived, trying even in her last hours to avoid all annoyance for  her husband, asking his pardon with an imploring look for any trouble  which her death might cause him. Elena came to the ranch in order to see  her mother's body for the last time, and Desnoyers who for more than  a year had been supporting them behind his father-in-law's back, took  advantage of this occasion to overcome the old man's resentment.    \"Well, I'll forgive her,\" said the ranchman finally. \"I'll do it for the  sake of my poor wife and for you. She may remain on the ranch, and that  shameless gringo may come with her.\"    But he would have nothing to do with him. The German was to be an  employee under Desnoyers, and they could live in the office building as  though they did not belong to the family. He would never say a word to  Karl.    But scarcely had the German returned before he began giving him orders  rudely as though he were a perfect stranger. At other times he would  pass by him as though he did not know him. Upon finding Elena in the  house with his older daughter, he would go on without speaking to her.    In vain his Romantica transfigured by maternity, improved all  opportunities for putting her child in his way, calling him loudly by  name: \"Julio . . . Julio!\"    \"They want that brat of a singing gringo, that carrot top with a face  like a skinned kid to be my grandson? . . . I prefer Celedonio's.\"    And by way of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#12)"],[1," material for an effective theatrical tragedy  as they did to Ibsen. Ibsen's Vikings in Helgeland is, in kind, what  Siegfried's Death was originally intended to be: that is, a heroic piece  for the theatre, without the metaphysical or allegorical complications  of The Ring. Indeed, the ultimate catastrophe of the Saga cannot by any  perversion of ingenuity be adapted to the perfectly clear allegorical  design of The Rhine Gold, The Valkyries, and Siegfried.          SIEGFRIED AS PROTESTANT    The philosophically fertile element in the original project of  Siegfried's Death was the conception of Siegfried himself as a type of  the healthy man raised to perfect confidence in his own impulses by  an intense and joyous vitality which is above fear, sickliness of  conscience, malice, and the makeshifts and moral crutches of law and  order which accompany them. Such a character appears extraordinarily  fascinating and exhilarating to our guilty and conscience-ridden  generations, however little they may understand him. The world has  always delighted in the man who is delivered from conscience. From Punch  and Don Juan down to Robert Macaire, Jeremy Diddler and the pantomime  clown, he has always drawn large audiences; but hitherto he has been  decorously given to the devil at the end. Indeed eternal punishment is  sometimes deemed too high a compliment to his nature. When the late Lord  Lytton, in his Strange Story, introduced a character personifying the  joyousness of intense vitality, he felt bound to deny him the immortal  soul which was at that time conceded even to the humblest characters in  fiction, and to accept mischievousness, cruelty, and utter incapacity  for sympathy as the inevitable consequence of his magnificent bodily and  mental health.    In short, though men felt all the charm of abounding life and  abandonment to its impulses, they dared not, in their deep  self-mistrust, conceive it otherwise than as a force making for  evil--one which must lead to universal ruin unless checked and literally  mortified by self-renunciation in obedience to superhuman guidance, or  at least to some reasoned system of morals. When it became apparent to  the cleverest of them that no such superhuman guidance existed, and  that their secularist systems had all the fictitiousness of \"revelation\"  without its poetry, there was no escaping the conclusion that all the  good that man had done must be put down to his arbitrary will as well as  all the evil he had done; and it was also obvious that if progress were  a reality, his beneficent impulses must be gaining on his destructive  ones. It was under the influence of these ideas that we began to hear  about the joy of life where we had formerly heard about the grace of God  or the Age of Reason, and that the boldest spirits began to raise the  question whether churches and laws and the like were not doing a great  deal more harm than good by their action in limiting the freedom of the  human will. Four hundred years ago, when belief in God and in revelation  was general throughout Europe, a similar wave of thought led the  strongest-hearted peoples to affirm that every man's private judgment  was a more trustworthy interpreter of God and revelation than the  Church. This was called Protestantism; and though the Protestants were  not strong enough for their creed, and soon set up a Church of their  own, yet the movement, on the whole, has justified the direction it  took. Nowadays the supernatural element in Protestantism has perished;  and if every man's private judgment is still to be justified as the most  trustworthy interpreter of the will of Humanity (which is not a  more extreme proposition than the old one about the will of God)  Protestantism must take a fresh step in advance, and become Anarchism.  Which it has accordingly done, Anarchism being one of the notable new  creeds of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.    The weak place which experience finds out in the Anarchist theory is  its reliance on the progress already achieved by \"Man.\" There is no such  thing as Man in the world: what we have to deal with is a multitude of  men, some of them great rascals, some of them great statesmen, others  both, with a vast majority capable of managing their personal affairs,  but not of comprehending social organization, or grappling with the  problems created by their association in enormous numbers. If \"Man\"  means this majority, then \"Man\" has made no progress: he has, on  the contrary, resisted it. He will not even pay the cost of existing  institutions: the requisite money has to be filched from him by  \"indirect taxation.\" Such people, like Wagner's giants, must be  governed by laws; and their assent to such government must be secured  by deliberately filling them with prejudices and practicing on their  imaginations by pageantry and artificial eminences and dignities.  The government is of course established by the few who are capable of  government, though its mechanism once complete, it may be, and generally  is, carried on unintelligently by people who are incapable of it the  capable people repairing it from time to time when it gets too far  behind the continuous advance or decay of civilization. All these  capable people are thus in the position of Wotan, forced to maintain as  sacred, and themselves submit to, laws which they privately know to be  obsolescent makeshifts, and to affect the deepest veneration for creeds  and ideals which they ridicule among themselves with cynical scepticism.  No individual Siegfried can rescue them from this bondage and hypocrisy;  in fact, the individual Siegfried has come often enough, only to find  himself confronted with the alternative of governing those who are not  Siegfrieds or risking destruction at their hands. And this dilemma will  persist until Wotan's inspiration comes to our governors, and they see  that their business is not the devising of laws and institutions to prop  up the weaknesses of mobs and secure the survival of the unfittest, but  the breeding of men whose wills and intelligences may be depended on to  produce spontaneously the social well-being our clumsy laws now aim at  and miss. The majority of men at present in Europe have no business  to be alive; and no serious progress will be made until we address  ourselves earnestly and scientifically to the task of producing  trustworthy human material for society. In short, it is necessary to  breed a race of men in whom the life-giving impulses predominate, before  the New Protestantism becomes politically practicable. [*]         * The necessity for breeding the governing class from a       selected stock has always been recognized by Aristocrats,       however erroneous their methods of selection. We have       changed our system from Aristocracy to Democracy without       considering that we were at the same time changing, as       regards our governing class, from Selection to Promiscuity.       Those who have taken a practical part in modern politics       best know how farcical the result is.      The most inevitable dramatic conception, then, of the nineteenth  century, is that of a perfectly naive hero upsetting religion, law and  order in all directions, and establishing in their place the unfettered  action of Humanity doing exactly what it likes, and producing order  instead of confusion thereby because it likes to do what is necessary  for the good of the race. This conception, already incipient in Adam  Smith's Wealth of Nations, was certain at last to reach some great  artist, and be embodied by him in a masterpiece. It was also certain  that if that master happened to be a German, he should take delight  in describing his hero as the Freewiller of Necessity, thereby beyond  measure exasperating Englishmen with a congenital incapacity for  metaphysics.          PANACEA QUACKERY, OTHERWISE IDEALISM    Unfortunately, human enlightenment does not progress by nicer and nicer  adjustments, but by violent corrective reactions which invariably send  us clean over our saddle and would bring us to the ground on the other  side if the next reaction did not send us back again with equally  excessive zeal. Ecclesiasticism and Constitutionalism send us one way,  Protestantism and Anarchism the other; Order rescues us from confusion  and lands us in Tyranny; Liberty then saves the situation and is  presently found to be as great a nuisance as Despotism. A scientifically  balanced application of these forces, theoretically possible, is  practically incompatible with human passion. Besides, we have the same  weakness in morals as in medicine: we cannot be cured of running after  panaceas, or, as they are called in the sphere of morals, ideals. One  generation sets up duty, renunciation, self-sacrifice as a panacea. The  next generation, especially the women, wake up at the age of forty or  thereabouts to the fact that their lives have been wasted in the worship  of this ideal, and, what is still more aggravating, that the elders who  imposed it on them did so in a fit of satiety with their own experiments  in the other direction. Then that defrauded generation foams at the  mouth at the very mention of duty, and sets up the alternative panacea  of love, their deprivation of which seems to them to have been the most  cruel and mischievous feature of their slavery to duty. It is useless to  warn them that this reaction, if prescribed as a panacea, will prove as  great a failure as all the other reactions have done; for they do not  recognize its identity with any reaction that ever occurred before.  Take for instance the hackneyed historic example of the austerity of  the Commonwealth being followed by the licence of the Restoration.  You cannot persuade any moral enthusiast to accept this as a pure  oscillation from action to reaction. If he is a Puritan he looks upon  the Restoration as a national disaster: if he is an artist he regards it "]]]
