[33-1] The language of the vellum AM. 557 is somewhat different in this  and the previous sentence. It does not say that \"they sailed southward  along the land for a long time, and came to a cape,\" but, \"when two  _doegr_ had elapsed, they descried land, and they sailed off this land;  there was a cape to which they came. They beat into the wind along this  coast, having the land upon the starboard side. This was a bleak coast,  with long and sandy shores. They went ashore in boats, and found the  keel of a ship, so they called it Keelness there; they likewise gave a  name to the strands and called them Wonderstrands, because they were  long to sail by.\"    [33-2] AM. 557 says _biafal_. Neither word has been identified.    [33-3] Hauk's Book says \"eider-ducks.\"    [34-1] The god Thor.    [35-1] The prose sense is: \"Men promised me, when I came hither, that I  should have the best of drink; it behooves me before all to blame the  land. See, oh, man! how I must raise the pail; instead of drinking wine,  I have to stoop to the spring\" (Reeves).    [35-2] The prose sense is: \"Let us return to our countrymen, leaving  those who like the country here, to cook their whale on Wonder-strand.\"  From an archaic form in these lines it is apparent that they are older  than either of the vellums, and must have been composed at least a  century before Hauk's Book was written; they may well be much older than  the beginning of the thirteenth century (Reeves). The antiquity of the  verses of the saga is also attested by a certain metrical irregularity,  as in poetry of the tenth and beginning of the eleventh centuries  (Storm).    [35-3] In the next sentence the authority for this doubtful statement  seems to be placed upon \"traders.\"    [36-1] Note the word \"hollows\" with reference to the contention that  \"wild wheat\" is \"wild rice.\" See p. 25, note 3.    [36-2] \"Skin-canoes,\" or kayaks, lead one to think of Eskimos. Both Storm  and Fiske think that the authorities of the saga-writer may have failed  to distinguish between bark-canoes and skin-canoes.    [36-3] The vellum AM. 557 says \"small men\" instead of \"swarthy men.\" The  explorers called them _Skraelingar_, a disparaging epithet, meaning  inferior people, _i.e._, savages. The name is applied, in saga  literature, to the natives of Greenland as well as to the natives of  Vinland. Storm thinks the latter were the Micmac Indians of Nova Scotia.    [36-4] \"Lescarbot, in his minute and elaborate description of the Micmacs  of Acadia, speaks with some emphasis of their large eyes. Dr. Storm quite  reasonably suggests that the Norse expression may refer to the size not  of the eyeball but of the eye-socket, which in the Indian face is apt to  be large.\" Fiske, _The Discovery of America_, p. 190.    [37-1] This would seem to place Vinland farther south than Nova Scotia,  but not necessarily. Storm cites the Frenchman Denys, who as colonist and  governor of Nova Scotia passed a number of years there, and in a work  published in 1672 says of the inner tracts of the land east of Port Royal  that \"there is very little snow in the country, and very little winter.\"  He adds: \"It is certain that the country produces the vine  naturally,--that it bears a grape that ripens perfectly, the berry as  large as the muscat.\"    [37-2] An animal unknown to the natives. As Fiske suggests, \"It is the  unknown that frightens.\"    [38-1] A euphemism for pregnant; the original is _eigi heil_.    [40-1] Thus reaching the western coast of Cape Breton Island and Nova  Scotia, according to Storm.    [40-2] The Norse word is _Ein-foetingr_, one-footer. The mediaeval  belief in a country in which there lived a race of unipeds was not  unknown in Iceland. It has been suggested by Vigfusson that Thorvald  being an important personage, his death must be adorned in some way. It  is a singular fact that Jacques Cartier brought back from his Canadian  explorations reports of a land peopled by a race of one-legged folk. See  Reeves, _The Finding of Wineland_, p. 177, (56).    [40-3] The literal translation is: \"The men drove, it is quite true, a  one-footer down to the shore. The strange man ran hard over the banks.  Hearken, Karlsefni!\"    [41-1] As skilled mariners the explorers were undoubtedly competent to  make such a deduction as this. If Storm and Dieserud are correct, the  explorers saw from the north coast of Nova Scotia the same mountains that  they had seen from the south coast.    [41-2] The Beothuk Indians of Newfoundland, according to Storm.    [41-3] Nothing can with certainty be extracted from these names. The  chances that they were incorrectly recorded are of course great. Storm  contends that they cannot be Eskimo. Captain Holm of the Danish navy, an  authority on the Eskimos, says, \"It is not _impossible_ that the names  may have been derived from Eskimo originals.\" Fiske says, p. 189, note:  \"There is not the slightest reason for supposing that there were any  Eskimos south of Labrador so late as nine hundred years ago.\" In this  connection Captain Holm says: \"It appears to me not sufficiently proven  that the now extinct race on America's east coast, the Beothuk, were  Indians. I wish to direct attention to the possibility that in the  Beothuk we may perhaps have one of the transition links between the  Indians and the Eskimo.\" See Reeves, p. 177, (57).    [42-1] The description is clearly suggestive of processions of Christian  priests, in white vestments, with banners, and singing (Storm).    [42-2] Vellum AM. 557 has not the words \"Ireland the Great.\" As to  \"White-men's-land\" (mentioned also once in the _Landnama-bok_), Storm  traces its quasi-historical origin to the Irish visitation of Iceland  prior to the Norse settlement. See _Studies on the Vineland Voyages_, p.  61. The explanation is, however, hardly convincing. See _Origines  Islandicae_, Vol. II., p. 625.    [42-3] AM. 557 says \"Iceland's sea\" (_i.e._, between Iceland and  Markland), and Hauk's Book, \"Greenland's sea\" (_i.e._, between Iceland  and Greenland).    [43-1] Thorlak was born in 1085, consecrated bishop in 1118, and died  Feb. 1, 1133. These dates are definitely known, and are important. \"The  bishop's birth-year being certainly known, one can reckon back, and  according to the regular allowances, we shall have Hallfrid born about  1060, and her father about 1030, in Vinland, and Karlsefni as far back as  1000.\" Vigfusson in _Origines Islandicae_, Vol. II., p. 592. Vigfusson  seeks to corroborate the above by other allied lineages. If his  deductions are correct, they are revolutionary with reference to the  generally accepted chronology of the Vinland voyages. He is convinced  that Leif belongs to an older generation than Karlsefni and his wife, and  that Leif's declining years coincide with Karlsefni's appearance on the  scene. The expeditions would then stand in the year 1025-1035, or  1030-1040, while Leif may have headed the first expedition, say in 1025.  And he thinks that various things outside of the genealogies point to  this. See Introduction, p. 12, of this volume.    [43-2] Biorn was consecrated bishop in 1147, and died in 1162. His  successor was Bishop Brand \"the Elder,\" who died in 1201. Both Hauk's  Book and AM. 557 refer to him as \"the Elder\"; hence the originals could  not have been written before the accession of the second bishop Brand,  which was in 1263. He died the following year. AM. 557 concludes with the  words \"Bishop Brand the Elder.\" But in Hauk's Book the genealogical  information is carried down to Hauk's own time. He was a descendant of  Karlsefni and Gudrid, through Snorri, born in Vinland.          THE VINLAND HISTORY OF THE FLAT ISLAND BOOK[45-1]      _A Brief History of Eric the Red._[45-2]--There was a man named Thorvald,  a son of Osvald, Ulf's son, Eyxna-Thori's son. Thorvald and Eric the Red,  his son, left Jaederen [in Norway], on account of manslaughter, and went  to Iceland. At that time Iceland was extensively colonized. They first  lived at Drangar on Horn-strands, and there Thorvald died. Eric then  married Thorhild, the daughter of Jorund and Thorbiorg the Ship-chested,  who was then married to Thorbiorn of the Haukadal family. Eric then  removed from the north, and made his home at Ericsstadir by Vatnshorn.  Eric and Thorhild's son was called Leif.    After the killing of Eyiulf the Foul, and Duelling-Hrafn, Eric was  banished from Haukadal, and betook himself westward to Breidafirth,  settling in Eyxney at Ericsstadir. He loaned his outer dais-boards to  Thorgest, and could not get these again when he demanded them. This gave  rise to broils and battles between himself and Thorgest, as Eric's Saga  relates. Eric was backed in the dispute by Styr Thorgrimsson, Eyiulf of  Sviney, the sons of Brand of Alptafirth and Thorbiorn Vifilsson, while  the Thorgesters were upheld by the sons of Thord the Yeller and Thorgeir  of Hitardal. Eric was declared an outlaw at Thorsnessthing. He thereupon  equipped his ship for a voyage, in Ericsvag, and when he was ready to  sail, Styr and the others accompanied him out beyond the islands. Eric  told them, that it was his purpose to go in search of that country which  Gunnbiorn, son of Ulf the Crow, had seen, when he was driven westward  across the main, at the time when he discovered Gunnbiorns-skerries; he  added, that he would return to his friends, if he should succeed in  finding this country. Eric sailed out from Snaefellsiokul, and found the  land. He gave the name of Midiokul to his landfall; this is now called  Blacksark. From thence he proceeded southward along the coast, in search  of habitable land. He passed the first winter at Ericsey, near the middle  of the Eastern Settlement, and the following spring he went to  Ericsfirth, where he selected a dwelling-place. In the summer he visited  the western uninhabited country, and assigned names to many of the  localities. The second winter he remained at Holmar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],[0,"Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#12)"],[1,"it is no sin to wish him better  off, since he can't enjoy life!\"    \"He might if Florence and his son were restored to him.\"    \"What do you mean, Bolton?\" asked Curtis, suspiciously.    \"What could I mean? It merely occurred to me,\" said Bolton,  innocently. \"You say he is quiet, thinkin' the girl will come around?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Suppose time passes, and she doesn't? Won't he try to find her? As  she is in the city, that won't be hard.\"    \"I shall represent that she has left the city.\"    \"For any particular point?\"    \"No, that is not necessary.\"    \"And then?\"    \"If he worries himself into the grave, so much the better for me.\"    \"There is no halfway about you, Mr. Curtis Waring.\"    \"Why should there be? Listen, Bolton; I have set my all on this cast.  I am now thirty-six, and still I am dependent upon my uncle's bounty.  I am in debt, and some of my creditors are disposed to trouble me. My  uncle is worth--I don't know how much, but I think half a million.  What does he get out of it? Food and clothes, but not happiness. If it  were mine, all the avenues of enjoyment would be open to me. That  estate I must have.\"    \"Suppose you get it, what is there for me?\" asked Bolton.    \"I will see that you are recompensed if you help me to it.\"    \"Will you put that in writing?\"    \"Do you take me for a fool? To put it in writing would be to place me  in your power! You can trust me.\"    \"Well, perhaps so,\" said Tim Bolton, slowly.    \"At any rate you will have to. Well, good-night. I will see you again.  In the meantime try to find the boy.\"    Tim Bolton followed him with his eyes, as he left the saloon.    \"What would he say,\" said Bolton to himself, \"if he knew that the will  he so much wishes to find is in my hands, and that I hold him in my  power already?\"          Chapter XV.  The New Governess.      \"Wish me luck, Dodger!\"    \"So I do, Florence. Are you goin' to begin teachin' this mornin'?\"    \"Yes; and I hope to produce a favorable impression. It is very  important to me to please Mrs. Leighton and my future pupil.\"    \"I'm sure you'll suit. How nice you look!\"    Florence smiled, and looked pleased. She had taken pains with her  dress and personal appearance, and, being luckily well provided with  handsome dresses, had no difficulty in making herself presentable. As  she stepped out of the shabby doorway upon the sidewalk no one  supposed her to be a tenant, but she was generally thought to be a  visitor, perhaps the agent of some charitable association.    \"Perhaps all will not judge me as favorably as you do, Dodger,\" said  Florence, with a laugh.    \"If you have the headache any day, Florence, I'll take your place.\"    \"You would look rather young for a tutor, Dodger, and I am afraid you  would not be dignified. Good-morning! I shall be back to dinner.\"    \"I am glad to find you punctual, Miss Linden,\" said Mrs. Leighton, as  Florence was ushered into her presence. \"This is your pupil, my  daughter, Carrie.\"    Florence smiled and extended her hand.    \"I hope we will like each other,\" she said.    The little girl eyed her with approval. This beautiful young lady was  a pleasant surprise to her, for, never having had a governess, she  expected to meet a stiff, elderly lady, of stern aspect. She readily  gave her hand to Florence, and looked relieved.    \"Carrie,\" said Mrs. Leighton, \"you may show Miss Linden the way to the  schoolroom.\"    \"All right, mamma,\" and the little girl led the way upstairs to a back  room on the third floor.    \"So this is to be our schoolroom, is it, Carrie?\" said Florence. \"It  is a very pleasant room.\"    \"Yes; but I should have preferred the front chamber. Mamma thought  that I might be looking into the street too much. Here there is only a  back yard, and nothing to look at.\"    \"Your mamma seems very judicious,\" said Florence, smiling. \"Are you  fond of study?\"    \"Well, I ain't exactly fond, but I will do my best.\"    \"That is all that can be expected.\"    \"Do you know, Miss Linden, you don't look at all like I expected.\"    \"Am I to be glad or sorry for that?\"    \"I thought you would be an old maid, stiff and starched, like May  Robinson's governess.\"    \"I am not married, Carrie, so perhaps you may regard me as an old  maid.\"    \"You'll never be an old maid,\" said Carrie, confidently. \"You are too  young and pretty.\"    \"Thank you, Carrie,\" said Florence, with a little blush. \"You say  that, I hope, because you are going to like me.\"    \"I like you already,\" said the little girl, impulsively. \"I've got a  cousin that will like you, too.\"    \"A young girl?\"    \"No; of course not. He is a young man. His name is Percy de Brabazon.  It is a funny name, isn't it? You see, his father was a Frenchman.\"    Florence was glad that she already knew from Percy's own mouth of the  relationship, as it saved her from showing a degree of surprise that  might have betrayed her acquaintance with the young man.    \"What makes you think your cousin would like me, Carrie?\"    \"Because he always likes pretty girls. He is a masher.\"    \"That's slang, Carrie. I am sure your mamma wouldn't approve your  using such a word.\"    \"Don't tell her. It just slipped out. But about Percy--he wants very  much to be married.\"    Florence was not surprised to hear this, for she had the best reason  for knowing it to be true.    \"Is he a handsome young man?\" she asked, demurely.    \"He's funny looking. He's awful good-natured, but he isn't the sort of  young man I would like,\" concluded Carrie, with amusing positiveness.    \"I hope you don't let your mind run on such things. You are quite too  young.\"    \"Oh, I don't think much about it. But Percy is a dude. He spends a  sight for clothes. He always looks as if he had just come out of a  bandbox.\"    \"Is he in any business?\"    \"No; he has an independent fortune, so mamma says. He was in Europe  last year.\"    \"I think, Carrie, we must give up talking and attend to business. I  should have checked you before, but I thought a little conversation  would help us to get acquainted. Now show me your books, and I will  assign your lessons.\"    \"Don't give me too long lessons, please, Miss Linden.\"    \"I will take care not to task you beyond your strength. I don't want  my pupil to grow sick on my hands.\"    \"I hope you won't be too strict. When May Robinson makes two mistakes  her governess makes her learn her lessons over again.\"    \"I will promise not to be too strict. Now let me see your books.\"    The rest of the forenoon was devoted to study.    Florence was not only an excellent scholar, but she had the art of  imparting knowledge, and, what is very important, she was able in a  few luminous words to explain difficulties and make clear what seemed  to her pupil obscure.    So the time slipped quickly and pleasantly away, and it was noon  before either she or her pupil realized it.    \"It can't be twelve,\" said Carrie, surprised.    \"Yes, it is. We must defer further study till to-morrow.\"    \"Why, it is a great deal pleasanter than going to school, Miss Linden.  I dreaded studying at home, but now I like it.\"    \"I hope you will continue to, Carrie. I can say that the time has  passed away pleasantly for me.\"    As Florence prepared to resume her street dress, Carrie said:    \"Oh, I forgot! Mamma asked me to invite you to stay to lunch with me.  I take lunch as soon as school is out, at twelve o'clock, so I won't  detain you long.\"    \"Thank you, Carrie; I will stay with pleasure.\"    \"I am glad of that, for I don't like to sit down to the table alone.  Mamma is never here at this time. She goes out shopping or making  calls, so poor I have to sit down to the table alone. It will be ever  so much pleasure to have you with me.\"    Florence was by no means sorry to accept the invitation.    The meals she got at home were by no means luxurious, and the manner  of serving them was by no means what she enjoyed.    Mrs. O'Keefe, though a good friend and a kindhearted woman, was not a  model housekeeper, and Florence had been made fastidious by her early  training. Lunch was, of course, a plain meal, but what was furnished  was of the best quality, and the table service was such as might be  expected in a luxurious home.    Just as Florence was rising from the table, Mrs. Leighton entered the  room in street dress.    \"I am glad you remained to lunch, Miss Linden,\" she said. \"You will be  company for my little girl, who is very sociable. Carrie, I hope you  were a good girl, and gave Miss Linden no trouble.\"    \"Ask Miss Linden, mamma,\" said Carrie, confidently.    \"Indeed, she did very well,\" said Florence. \"I foresee that we shall  get along admirably.\"    \"I am glad to hear that. She is apt to be indolent.\"    \"I won't be with Miss Linden, mamma. She makes the studies so  interesting.\"    After Florence left the house, Carrie pronounced an eulogium upon her  which led Mrs. Leighton to congratulate herself upon having secured a  governess who had produced so favorable an impression on her little  girl.    \"Was you kept after school, Florence?\" asked Dodger, as she entered  her humble home. \"I am afraid you'll find your dinner cold.\"    \"Never mind, Dodger. I am to take dinner--or lunch, rather--at the  house where I am teaching; so hereafter Mrs. O'Keefe need not wait for  me.\"    \"And how do you like your place?\"    \"It is everything that is pleasant. You wished me good luck, Dodger,  and your wish has been granted.\"    \"I was lucky, too, Florence. I've made a dollar and a quarter this  mornin'.\"    \"Not by selling papers, surely?\"    \"Not all. A gentleman gave me fifty cents for takin' his valise to the  Long Branch boat.\"    \"It seems we are both getting rich,\" said Florence, smiling.          Chapter XVI.  Dodger Becomes Ambitious.      \"Ah, there, Dodger!\"    Dodger, who had been busily and successfully selling evening papers in  front of the Astor House, turned quickly as he heard his name called.
