Darkness gathered; the last  light faded from even the highest peaks; the last tinge of color dropped  out of the sky as they climbed from the valley. Now and then one of the  horses cleared its nostrils with a snort, but on the whole they went in  perfect silence with the short grass silencing the hoofbeats, and never  a word passed from man to man.    Beyond doubt, if it had not been for that same silence, if it had not  been for the slowness with which they drifted through the dark,  what follows could never have happened. They had crossed a hill, and  descended into a very narrow ravine which came to so sharp a point that  the horses had to be strung out in single file. The ravine twisted to  the right and then the last man of the procession heard the sheriff  call: \"Halt, there! Up with your hands, or I'll drill you!\" When they  swung from side to side, craning their heads to look, they made out a  shadowy horseman facing Pete head on. Then the sheriff's voice again:  \"Gregg, I'm considerable glad to meet up with you.\"    If that meeting had taken place in any other spot probably Gregg would  have taken his chance on escaping through the night, but in this narrow  pass he could swing to neither side and before he could turn the brown  horse entirely around the sheriff might pump him full of lead. They  gathered in a solemn quiet around him; the irons were already upon his  wrists.    \"All right, boys,\" he said, \"you've got me, but you'll have to give in  that you had all the luck.\"    A moment after that sharp command in the familiar, dreaded voice of Pete  Glass, Vic had been glad that the lone flight was over. Eventually this  was bound to come. He would go back and face the law, and three men  lived to swear that Blondy had gone after his gun first.    \"Maybe luck,\" said the sheriff. \"How d' you come back this way?\"    \"Made a plumb circle,\" chuckled Gregg. \"Rode like a fool not carin'  where I hit out for, and the end of it was that it was dark before I'd  had sense to watch where the sun went down.\"    \"Kind of cheerful, ain't you?\" cut in Ronicky Joe, and his voice was as  dry as the crisping leaves in an autumn wind.    \"They ain't any call for me to wear crepe yet,\" answered Gregg. \"Worst  fool thing I ever done was to cut and run for it. The old Captain will  tell you gents that Blondy went for his gun first--had it clean out of  the leather before I touched mine.\"    He paused, and the silence of those dark figures sank in upon him.    \"I got to warn you,\" said Pete Glass, \"that what you say now can be used  again you later on before the jury.\"    \"My God, boys,\" burst out Vic, \"d'you think I'm a plain, low-down,  murderin' snake? Harry, ain't you got a word for me? Are you like the  rest of 'em?\"    No voice answered.    \"Harry,\" said Ronicky, \"why don't you speak to him?\"    It was a brutal thing to do, but Ronicky was never a gentle sort in  his best moments; he scratched a match and held it so that under the  spluttering light Gregg found himself staring into the face of Harry  Fisher. And he could not turn his eyes away until the match burned  down to Ronicky's finger tip and then dropped in a streak of red to the  ground.    Then the sheriff spoke cold and hard.    \"Partner,\" he said, \"in the old days, maybe your line of talk would do  some good, but not now. You picked that fight with Blondy. You knew you  was faster on the draw and Hansen didn't have a chance. He was the worst  shot in Alder and everybody in Alder knew it. You picked that fight and  you killed your man, and you're goin' to hang for it.\"    Another hush; no murmur of assent or dissent.    \"But they's one way out for you, Gregg, and I'm layin' it clear. We  wanted you bad, and we got you; but they's another man we want a lot  worse. A pile! Gregg, take me where I can find the gent what done for  Harry Fisher and you'll never stand up in front of a jury. You got my  word on that.\"        Chapter XII. The Crisis    Those mountains above the Barry cabin were, as he told Vic Gregg,  inaccessible to men on horseback except by one path, yet there was a  single class of travelers who roamed at will through far more difficult  ground than this. Speaking in general, where a man can go a burro can  go, and where a burro can go he usually manages to carry his pack. He  crawls up a raged down-pitch of rocks that comes dangerously close to  the perpendicular; he walks securely along a crumbling ledge with half  his body over a thousand yards of emptiness. Therefore the prospectors  with their burros have combed the worst mountains of the West and it  was hardly a surprise to Kate Barry when she saw two men come down the  steepest slope above the cabin with two little pack animals scrambling  and sliding before them. It was still some time before nightfall, but  the sun had dropped out of sight fully an hour ago and now the western  mountains were blackening against a sky whose thin, clear blue grew  yellow towards evening.    Against that dark mass of the mountainside, she could not make out the  two travelers clearly, so she shaded her eyes and peered up, high up.  The slope was so sheer that if one of the four figures lost footing it  would come crashing to her very feet. When they saw her and shouted down  the sound fell as clearly as if they had called from the cabin, yet they  had a good half hour's labor between that greeting and the moment they  came out on the level before Kate. From the instant they called she  remained in motionless, deep thought, and when they came now into full  view, she cried out joyously: \"Buck, oh Buck!\" and ran towards them.  Even the burros stopped and the men stood statue-like; it is rarely  enough that one finds a human being in those mountains, almost an act  of Providence that lead to a house, and a miracle when the trail crosses  the path of a friend. The prospectors came out of their daze with a  shout and rushed to meet her. Each of them had her by a hand, wringing  it; they talked all together in a storm of words.    \"Kate, I'm dreamin'!--Dear old Buck!--Have you forgotten me?--Lee  Haines! I should say not.--Don't pay any attention to him. Five  years. And I've been hungerin' to see you all that--.--Where have you  been?--Everywhere! but this is the best thing I've seen.--Come in.--Wait  till we get these packs off the poor little devils.--Oh, I'm so glad to  see you; so glad!--Hurry up, Lee. Your fingers asleep?--How long have  you been out?--Five months.--Then you're hungry.--We've just ate.--But a  piece of pie?--pie? I've been dreamin' of pie!\"    A fire already burned in the big living-room of the cabin, for at this  season, at such an altitude, the shadows were always cold, and around  the fire they gathered, each of the men with half a huge pie before him.  They were such as one might expect that mountain region to produce, big,  gaunt, hard-muscled. They had gone unshaven for so long that their faces  were clothed not with an unsightly stubble but with strong, short beard  that gave them a certain grim dignity and made their eyes seem sunken.  They were opposite types, which is usually the case when two men strike  out together. Buck Daniels was black-haired, with an ugly, shrewd face  and a suggestion of rather dangerous possibilities of swift action; but  Lee Haines was a great bulk of a man, with tawny beard, handsome, in a  leonine fashion, more poised than Daniels, fitted to crush. The sharp  glance of Buck flitted here and there, in ten seconds he knew everything  in the room; the steady blue eye of Lee Haines went leisurely from place  to place and lingered; but both of them stared at Kate as if they could  not have enough of her. They talked without pause while they ate. A  stranger in the room would have sealed their lips in utter taciturnity,  but here they sat with a friend, five months of loneliness and labor  behind them, and they gossiped like girls.    Into the jangle of talk cut a thin, small voice from outside, a burst of  laughter. Then: \"Bart, you silly dog!\" and Joan stood at the open door  with her hand buried in the mane of the wolf-dog. The fork of Buck  Daniels stopped halfway to his lips and Lee Haines straightened until  the chair groaned.    They spoke together, hushed voices: \"Kate!\"    \"Come here, Joan!\" Her face glistened with pride, and Joan came forward  with wide eyes, tugging Black Bart along in a reluctant progress.    \"It ain't possible!\" whispered Buck Daniels. \"Honey, come here and shake  hands with your Uncle Buck.\" The gesture called forth deep throated  warning from Bart, and he caught back his hand with a start.    \"It's always that way,\" said Kate, half amused, half vexed; \"Bart won't  let a soul touch her when Dan isn't home. Good old Bart, go away, you  foolish dog! Don't you see these are friends?\"    He cringed a little under the shadow of the hand which waved him off but  his only answer was a silent baring of the teeth.    \"You see how it is. I'm almost afraid to touch her myself when Dan's  away; she and Bart bully me all day long.\"    In the meantime the glance of Joan had cloyed itself with sufficient  examination of the strangers, and now she turned back towards the door  and the meadow beyond.    \"Bart!\" she called softly. The sharp ears of the dog quivered; he came  to attention with a start. \"Look! Get it for me!\"    One loud scraping of his claws on the floor as he started, and Black  Bart went like a bolt through the door with Joan scrambling after him,  screaming with excitement; from the outside, they heard the cry of  a frightened squirrel, and then its angry chattering from a place of  safety up a tree.    \"Shall I call her back again?\" asked Kate.    \"Not if Bart comes with her,\" answered Lee Haines. \"I've seen enough of  him to last me a while.\"    \"Well, we'll have her to ourselves when Dan comes; of course Bart leaves  her to tag around after Dan.\"    \"When is he comin' back?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#12)"],[1,"rgies. In  vain. I was told (by Berlin) that it would be against the dignity of  Austria. Of course, all that was needed was one hint from Berlin to  Count Berchtold (the Austrian Foreign Minister); he would have satisfied  himself with a diplomatic triumph and rested on the Serbian answer. That  hint was never given. On the contrary, pressure was brought in favor of  war....    After our refusal Sir Edward asked us to come forward with our proposal.  We insisted on war. No other answer could I get (from Berlin) than that  it was a colossal condescension on the part of Austria not to  contemplate any acquisition of territory. Sir Edward justly pointed out  that one could reduce a country to vassalage without acquiring  territory; that Russia would see this, and regard it as a humiliation  not to be put up with. The impression grew stronger and stronger that we  were bent on war. Otherwise our attitude toward a question in which we  were not directly concerned was incomprehensible. The insistent requests  and well-defined declarations of M. Sasanof, the Czar's positively  humble telegrams, Sir Edward's repeated proposals, the warnings of  Marquis San Guiliano and of Bollati, my own pressing admonitions were  all of no avail. Berlin remained inflexible--Serbia must be slaughtered.      Then, on the 29th, Sir Edward decided upon his well-known warning. I  told him I had always reported (to Berlin) that we should have to reckon  with English opposition if it came to a war with France. Time and again  the Minister said to me, \"If war breaks out it will be the greatest  catastrophe the world has ever seen.\" And now events moved rapidly.  Count Berchtold at last decided to come around, having up to that point  played the role of \"Strong man\" under guidance of Berlin. Thereupon we  (in answer to Russia's mobilization) sent our ultimatum and declaration  of war--after Russia had spent a whole week in fruitless negotiation and  waiting.    Thus ended my mission in London. It had suffered shipwreck, not on the  wiles of the Briton but on the wiles of our own policy. Were not those  right who saw that the German people was pervaded with the spirit of  Treitschke and Bernhardi, which glorifies war as an end instead of  holding it in abhorrence as an evil thing? Properly speaking militarism  is a school for the people and an instrument to further political ends.  But in the patriarchal absolutism of a military monarchy, militarism  exploits politics to further its own ends, and can create a situation  which a democracy freed from junkerdom would not tolerate.    That is what our enemies think; that is what they are bound to think  when they see that in spite of capitalistic industrialism, and in spite  of socialistic organizations, the living, as Nietzsche said, are still  ruled by the dead. The democratization of Germany, the first war aim  proposed by our enemies, will become a reality.    This is the frank statement of a great German statesman made long before  Germany received its knock-out blow. It was written when Germany was  sweeping all before it on land, and when the U-boat was at the height of  its murderous powers on the high seas. No one in nor out of Germany has  controverted any of its statements and it will forever remain as one of  the counts in the indictment against Germany and the sole cause of the  world's greatest misery, the war.    America's outstanding authority on matters of international conduct,  former Secretary of State Elihu Root declared that the World War was a  mighty and all-embracing struggle between two conflicting principles of  human right and human duty; it was a conflict between the divine right  of kings to govern mankind through armies and nobles, and the right of  the peoples of the earth who toil and endure and aspire to govern  themselves by law under justice, and in the freedom of individual  manhood.    After the declaration of war against Russia by Germany, events marched  rapidly and inevitably toward the general conflagration. Germany's most  strenuous efforts were directed toward keeping England out of the  conflict. We have seen in the revelations of Prince Lichnowsky how eager  was England to divert Germany's murderous purpose. There are some  details, however, required to fill in the diplomatic picture.    President Poincare, of the French Republic, on July 30th, asked the  British Ambassador in Paris for an assurance of British support. On the  following day he addressed a similar letter to King George of England.  Both requests were qualifiedly refused on the ground that England wished  to be free to continue negotiations with Germany for the purpose of  averting the war. In the meantime, the German Government addressed a  note to England offering guarantees for Belgian integrity, providing  Belgium did not side with France, offering to respect the neutrality of  Holland and giving assurance that no French territory in Europe would be  annexed if Germany won the war. Sir Edward Grey described this as a  \"shameful proposal,\" and rejected it on July 30th.    On July 31st England sent a note to France and Germany asking for a  statement of purpose concerning Belgian neutrality. France immediately  announced that it would respect the treaty of 1839 and its reaffirmation  in 1870 guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality. This treaty was entered into  by Germany, England, France, Austria and Russia. Germany's reply on  August 1st was a proposal that she would respect the neutrality of  Belgium if England would stay out of the war. This was promptly  declined. On August 2d the British cabinet agreed that if the German  fleet attempted to attack the coast of France the British fleet would  intervene. Germany, the next day, sent a note agreeing to refrain from  naval attacks on France provided England would remain neutral, but  declined to commit herself as to the neutrality of Belgium. Before this,  however, on August 2d, Germany had announced to Belgium its intention to  enter Belgium for the purpose of attacking France. The Belgian Minister  in London made an appeal to the British Foreign Office and was informed  that invasion of Belgium by Germany would be followed by England's  declaration of war. Monday, August 3d, was signalized by Belgium's  declaration of its neutrality and its firm purpose to defend its soil  against invasion by France, England, Germany or any other nation.    The actual invasion of Belgium commenced on the morning of August 4th,  when twelve regiments of Uhlans crossed the frontier near Vise, and came  in contact with a Belgian force driving it back upon Liege. King Albert  of Belgium promptly appealed to England, Russia and France for aid in  repelling the invader. England sent an ultimatum to Germany fixing  midnight of August 4th as the time for expiration of the ultimatum. This  demanded that satisfactory assurances be furnished immediately that  Germany would respect the neutrality of Belgium. No reply was made by  Germany and England's declaration of war followed.    Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, of the German Empire, wrote Germany's  infamy into history when, in a formal statement, he acknowledged that  the invasion of Belgium was \"a wrong that we will try to make good again  as soon as our military ends have been reached.\" To Sir Edward Vochen,  British Ambassador to Germany, he addressed the inquiry: \"Is it the  purpose of your country to make war upon Germany for the sake of a scrap  of paper?\" The treaty of 1839-1870 guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality was  the scrap of paper.

THE RED RUINS OF YPRES    Ypres, the British soldiers \"Wipers,\" was the scene of much of the    bloodiest fighting of the war. Three great battles were fought for its    possession. The photograph shows what was once the market place.    With the entrance of England into the war, the issue between autocracy  and democracy was made plain before the people of the world. Austria,  and later Turkey, joined with Germany; France, and Japan, by reason of  their respective treaty obligations joined England and Russia. Italy for  the time preferred to remain neutral, ignoring her implied alliance with  the Teutonic empires.
