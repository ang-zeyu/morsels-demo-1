It's short enough for golf, perhaps,  but--Hallo!\"    They had come to the place. The road bent round to the right, but they  kept straight on over a broad grass path for twenty yards, and there  in front of them was the green. A dry ditch, ten feet wide and six  feet deep, surrounded it, except in the one place where the path went  forward. Two or three grass steps led down to the green, on which there  was a long wooden beach for the benefit of spectators.    \"Yes, it hides itself very nicely,\" said Antony. \"Where do you keep the  bowls?\"    \"In a sort of summer house place. Round here.\"    They walked along the edge of the green until they came to it--a low  wooden bunk which had been built into one wall of the ditch.    \"H'm. Jolly view.\"    Bill laughed.    \"Nobody sits there. It's just for keeping things out of the rain.\"    They finished their circuit of the green \"Just in case anybody's in the  ditch,\" said Antony and then sat down on the bench.    \"Now then,\" said Bill, \"We are alone. Fire ahead.\"    Antony smoked thoughtfully for a little. Then he took his pipe out of  his mouth and turned to his friend.    \"Are you prepared to be the complete Watson?\" he asked.    \"Watson?\"    \"Do-you-follow-me-Watson; that one. Are you prepared to have quite  obvious things explained to you, to ask futile questions, to give me  chances of scoring off you, to make brilliant discoveries of your own  two or three days after I have made them myself--all that kind of thing?  Because it all helps.\"    \"My dear Tony,\" said Bill delightedly, \"need you ask?\" Antony said  nothing, and Bill went on happily to himself, \"I perceive from the  strawberry-mark on your shirt-front that you had strawberries for  dessert. Holmes, you astonish me. Tut, tut, you know my methods. Where  is the tobacco? The tobacco is in the Persian slipper. Can I leave my  practice for a week? I can.\"    Antony smiled and went on smoking. After waiting hopefully for a minute  or two, Bill said in a firm voice:    \"Well then, Holmes, I feel bound to ask you if you have deduced  anything. Also whom do you suspect?\"    Antony began to talk.    \"Do you remember,\" he said, \"one of Holmes's little scores over Watson  about the number of steps up to the Baker Street lodging? Poor old  Watson had been up and down them a thousand times, but he had never  thought of counting them, whereas Holmes had counted them as a matter of  course, and knew that there were seventeen. And that was supposed to  be the difference between observation and non-observation. Watson was  crushed again, and Holmes appeared to him more amazing than ever. Now,  it always seemed to me that in that matter Holmes was the ass, and  Watson the sensible person. What on earth is the point of keeping in  your head an unnecessary fact like that? If you really want to know  at any time the number of steps to your lodging, you can ring up your  landlady and ask her. I've been up and down the steps of the club a  thousand times, but if you asked me to tell you at this moment how many  steps there are I couldn't do it. Could you?\"    \"I certainly couldn't,\" said Bill.    \"But if you really wanted to know,\" said Antony casually, with a sudden  change of voice, \"I could find out for you without even bothering to  ring up the hall-porter.\"    Bill was puzzled as to why they were talking about the club steps, but  he felt it his duty to say that he did want to know how many they were.    \"Right,\" said Antony. \"I'll find out.\"    He closed his eyes.    \"I'm walking up St. James' Street,\" he said slowly. \"Now I've come to the  club and I'm going past the smoking-room--windows-one-two-three-four.  Now I'm at the steps. I turn in and begin going up them.  One-two-three-four-five-six, then a broad step; six-seven-eight-nine,  another broad step; nine-ten-eleven. Eleven--I'm inside. Good morning,  Rogers. Fine day again.\" With a little start he opened his eyes and came  back again to his present surroundings. He turned to Bill with a smile.  \"Eleven,\" he said. \"Count them the next time you're there. Eleven and  now I hope I shall forget it again.\"    Bill was distinctly interested.    \"That's rather hot,\" he said. \"Expound.\"    \"Well, I can't explain it, whether it's something in the actual eye, or  something in the brain, or what, but I have got rather an uncanny habit  of recording things unconsciously. You know that game where you look at  a tray full of small objects for three minutes, and then turn away and  try to make a list of them. It means a devil of a lot of concentration  for the ordinary person, if he wants to get his list complete, but in  some odd way I manage to do it without concentration at all. I mean that  my eyes seem to do it without the brain consciously taking any part. I  could look at the tray, for instance, and talk to you about golf at the  same time, and still get my list right.\"    \"I should think that's rather a useful gift for an amateur detective.  You ought to have gone into the profession before.\"    \"Well, it is rather useful. It's rather surprising, you know, to a  stranger. Let's surprise Cayley with it, shall we?\"    \"How?\"    \"Well, let's ask him--\" Antony stopped and looked at Bill comically,  \"let's ask him what he's going to do with the key of the office.\"    For a moment Bill did not understand.    \"Key of the office?\" he said vaguely. \"You don't mean--Tony! What do you  mean? Good God! do you mean that Cayley--But what about Mark?\"    \"I don't know where Mark is--that's another thing I want to know--but  I'm quite certain that he hasn't got the key of the office with him.  Because Cayley's got it.\"    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Quite.\"    Bill looked at him wonderingly.    \"I say,\" he said, almost pleadingly, \"don't tell me that you can see  into people's pockets and all that sort of thing as well.\"    Antony laughed and denied it cheerfully.    \"Then how do you know?\"    \"You're the perfect Watson, Bill. You take to it quite naturally.  Properly speaking, I oughtn't to explain till the last chapter, but I  always think that that's so unfair. So here goes. Of course, I don't  really know that he's got it, but I do know that he had it. I know that  when I came on him this afternoon, he had just locked the door and put  the key in his pocket.\"    \"You mean you saw him at the time, but that you've only just remembered  it--reconstructed it in the way you were explaining just now?\"    \"No. I didn't see him. But I did see something. I saw the key of the  billiard-room.\"    \"Where?    \"Outside the billiard-room door.\"    \"Outside? But it was inside when we looked just now.\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Who put it there?\"    \"Obviously Cayley.\"    \"But--\"    \"Let's go back to this afternoon. I don't remember noticing the  billiard-room key at the time; I must have done so without knowing.  Probably when I saw Cayley banging at the door I may have wondered  subconsciously whether the key of the room next to it would fit.  Something like that, I daresay. Well, when I was sitting out by myself  on that seat just before you came along, I went over the whole scene in  my mind, and I suddenly saw the billiard-room key there outside. And I  began to wonder if the office-key had been outside too. When Cayley came  up, I told you my idea and you were both interested. But Cayley was just  a shade too interested. I daresay you didn't notice it, but he was.\"    \"By Jove!\"    \"Well, of course that proved nothing; and the key business didn't really  prove anything, because whatever side of the door the other keys were,  Mark might have locked his own private room from the inside sometimes.  But I piled it on, and pretended that it was enormously important, and  quite altered the case altogether, and having got Cayley thoroughly  anxious about it, I told him that we should be well out of the way for  the next hour or so, and that he would be alone in the house to do what  he liked about it. And, as I expected, he couldn't resist it. He altered  the keys and gave himself away entirely.\"    \"But the library key was still outside. Why didn't he alter that?\"    \"Because he's a clever devil. For one thing, the Inspector had been  in the library, and might possibly have noticed it already. And for  another--\" Antony hesitated.    \"What?\" said Bill, after waiting for him to go on.    \"It's only guesswork. But I fancy that Cayley was thoroughly upset about  the key business. He suddenly realized that he had been careless, and  he hadn't got time to think it all over. So he didn't want to commit  himself definitely to the statement that the key was either outside or  inside. He wanted to leave it vague. It was safest that way.\"    \"I see,\" said Bill slowly.    But his mind was elsewhere. He was wondering suddenly about Cayley.  Cayley was just an ordinary man--like himself. Bill had had little jokes  with him sometimes; not that Cayley was much of a hand at joking.  Bill had helped him to sausages, played tennis with him, borrowed his  tobacco, lent him a putter.... and here was Antony saying that he was  what? Well, not an ordinary man, anyway. A man with a secret. Perhaps  a murderer. No, not a murderer; not Cayley. That was rot, anyway. Why,  they had played tennis together.    \"Now then, Watson,\" said Antony suddenly. \"It's time you said  something.\"    \"I say, Tony, do you really mean it?\"    \"Mean what?\"    \"About Cayley.\"    \"I mean what I said, Bill. No more.\"    \"Well, what does it amount to?\"    \"Simply that Robert Ablett died in the office this afternoon, and that  Cayley knows exactly how he died. That's all. It doesn't follow that  Cayley killed him.\"    \"No. No, of course it doesn't.\" Bill gave a sigh of relief. \"He's just  shielding Mark, what?\"    \"I wonder.\"    \"Well, isn't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#12)"],[1,"and passed the  time of day with shallow words.    With heads erect, they glanced at each other and passed on. And if they  spoke, it was with taunt, insult and challenge.    Jennie's keen eyes rested on two vacant chairs on the floor of the  Senate--every seat was crowded save these two.    She pressed Dick's arm.    \"See--the vacant seats of South Carolina!\"    \"They're not vacant,\" the boy drawled.    \"They are--look--\"    \"I see a white figure in each--\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"We're going to have war, I tell you! Death sits in those chairs to-day,  Jennie--\"    \"Sh--don't talk like that--\"    The boy laughed.    \"I'm not afraid, you know--just a sort of second sight--maybe it means  I'll be killed--\"           *     *     *     *     *    South Carolina had felt no forebodings on the day her Convention had  recalled those Senators. Kiett the eloquent leader of the Convention  sprang to his feet, his face flaming with passion that was half delirium  as he shouted:    \"This day is the culmination of long years of bitterness, of suffering  and of struggle. We are performing a great deed, which holds in its  magic not only the stirring present, it embraces the ages yet to come. I  am content with what has been done to-day. I shall be content with it  to-morrow. We have lowered the body of the old Union to its last resting  place. We drop the flag over its grave.\"    When the vote was announced, without a single dissenting voice, the  crowd rose to their feet with a shout of applause which shook the  building to its foundations. It died away at last only to rise again  with redoubled fury.    Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida had followed in rapid  succession, Louisiana's Convention was to meet on the twenty-sixth,  Texas on February first. On this the twenty-first day of January the  Senators from Florida, Mississippi and Alabama had announced their  farewell addresses to the Old Union.    The girl's eyes swept the crowded tiers of the galleries packed with  beautifully gowned Southern women. Every glove, fan, handkerchief,  bonnet or dress--every dainty stocking and filmy piece of lingerie had  been imported direct from the fashion centers of Europe. Gowns of  priceless lace and velvets had been woven to order in the looms of  Genoa, Venice and Brussels.    The South was rich.    And yet not one of her representatives held his office in Washington  because of his money. Her ruling classes were without exception an  aristocracy of brains--yet they were distinctly an aristocracy.    The election of Abraham Lincoln was more than a threat to confiscate  three thousand millions of dollars which the South had invested in  slaves. The homely rail splitter from the West was the prophecy of a new  social order which threatened the foundations of the modern world. He  himself was all unconscious of this fact. And yet this big reality was  the secret of the electric tension which strangled men into silence and  threw over the scene the sense of ominous foreboding.    The debates in Congress during the tempestuous session had been utterly  insincere and without meaning. The real leaders knew that the time for  discussion had passed. Two absolutely irreconcilable moral principles  had clashed and the Republic was squarely and hopelessly broken into two  vast sectional divisions on the issue.    Beyond the fierce and uncompromising hatred of Slavery which had grown  into a consuming passion throughout the North and had resulted in the  election of Lincoln as a purely sectional candidate--behind and  underneath this apparent moral rage lay a bigger and far more elemental  fact--the growing consciousness of the laboring man that the earth and  the fullness thereof were his.    And bigger than the fear of the confiscation of their property and the  destruction of the Constitution their fathers had created loomed before  the Southern mind the Specter of a new democracy at the touch of whose  fetid breath the soul of culture and refinement they believed must die.  In the vulgar ranks of this democracy must march sooner or later four  million negroes but yesterday from the jungles of Africa.    This greater issue was felt but dimly by the leaders on either side but  it was realized with sufficient clearness to make compromise impossible.    In vain did the aged and the feeble plead once more for compromise. Real  men no longer wished it.    The day of reckoning had come. The seeds of this tragedy were planted in  the foundation structure of the Republic.    The Union of our fathers, for all the high sounding phrases of its  Declaration of Independence was not a democracy. It was from the  beginning an aristocratic republic founded squarely on African Slavery.  And the degraded position assigned to the man who labored with his hands  was recognized in our organic law.    The Constitution itself was the work of a rich and powerful group of  leaders in each State, and its provisions were a compromise of  conflicting sectional property interests.    The world had moved from 1789 to 1861.    The North was unconsciously lifting the banner of a mighty revolution.  The South was clinging with the desperation of despair to the faith of  its fathers.    The North was the world of steam and electricity, of new ideas, of  progress. The South still believed in the divine inspiration of the men  who founded the Republic. They must believe in it, for their racial life  depended on it. Four million negroes could not be loosed among five  million Southern white people and two such races live side by side under  the principles of a pure democracy. Had this issue been put to them in  the beginning not one Southern State would have entered the Union.    The Northern workingman, with steam and electricity bringing North and  South into closer and closer touch, answered this cry of fear from the  South with the ultimatum of democracy:    \"This Nation can not endure half slave and half free!\"    Back of all the mouthings of demagogues and the billingsgate of  sectionalists lay this elemental fact--a democracy against a republic.    Nor could the sword of the Sections settle such an issue. The sectional  sword could only settle an issue which grew out of it--whether a group  of States holding a common interest in this conflict of principles could  combine for their own peace and safety, leave the old Union, form a new  one and settle it in their own way.    The North said no--the South said yes. This conviction bigger than party  platforms was the brooding terror which brought the sense of tragedy to  young and old, the learned and the unlearned--that made young men see  visions and maids dream of mighty deeds.           *     *     *     *     *    The Southern boy's eyes had again rested on the vacant chairs of the  Senators from South Carolina with a set look in their depths.    The crowd turned with sudden stir to the door of the Senate Chamber.    \"Look,\" Jennie cried, \"that's Mrs. Clem Clay of Alabama--how pale and  beautiful she is! The Senator's going to make the speech of his life  to-day. She's scared--Ah, that dress, that dress--isn't it a dream? Did  you ever see such a piece of velvet--and--do look at that dear little  gold hand holding the skirt up just high enough to see the exquisite  lace on her petticoat--\"    \"Where's the golden hand--I don't see it?\" Dick broke in skeptically.    \"Don't you see the chain hanging from her waist?\"    \"Yes, I see that.\"    \"Follow it with your eye and you'll see the hand. The Bayard sisters  introduced them from Paris, you know.\"    The boy had ceased to listen to Jennie's chatter. His eye had suddenly  rested on a group of three men seated in the diplomatic gallery--one  evidently of high official position by the deference paid him. The man  on the left of the official was young, handsome, slender, and pulled the  corners of his mustache with a slow lazy touch of his graceful hand. His  eyes were fixed on Jennie with a steady gaze. The Minister from  Sardinia, of the Court of Victor Emmanuel, sat on the right, bowing and  gesticulating with an enthusiasm out of all proportion to the importance  of the conversation.    Behind this group sat a fourth man who leaned forward occasionally and  whispered to the official. His face was in shadow and the only thing  Dick could see was the thick dark brown beard which covered his regular  features and a pair of piercing black eyes.    \"For heaven's sake, Jennie,\" the boy cried at last, \"who is that villain  in the Diplomatic gallery?\"    \"Where?\"    \"In the corner there on the right.\"    \"Oh, that's the Sardinian Minister--King Victor Emmanuel's new drummer  of trade for Genoa. He's getting ahead of the French, too.\"    \"No--no, I don't mean that little rat. I mean the big fellow with the  heavy jaw and a face like a rattlesnake. He's trying to charm you too.\"    Jennie laughed.    \"Silly! That's the new Secretary of War, Joseph Holt.\"    \"A scoundrel, if God ever made one--\"    \"Because he looks at me?\"    \"No--that shows his good taste. It's the way he looks at you and moves  his crooked mouth and the way he bends his big flat head forward.\"    \"Rubbish--he's a loyal Southerner--and if we have to fight he'll be with  us.\"    \"Yes--he--_will_!\"    \"Of course, he will. He's careful now. He's in old Buck's cabinet. Wait  and see. He called on Mr. Davis last night.\"    \"That's nothing--so did old Seward--\"    \"Different--Seward's a Black Republican from New York--Holt's a Southern  Democrat from Mississippi.\"    \"And who's the young knight by his side with the dear little mustache to  which he seems so attached?\"    Jennie looked in silence for a moment.    \"I never saw him before. He's handsome, isn't he?\"    \"Looks to me like a young black snake just shed his skin waiting for  that old adder to show him how to strike.\"    \"Dick--\"    \"God save the Queen! They're coming here--they're coming for you--\"    The Secretary of War had nodded in recognition"]]]
