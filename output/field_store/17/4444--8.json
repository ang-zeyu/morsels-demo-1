Plate 45, Fig. 1, shows one made out  of black cassowary feathers, white cockatoo feathers, red parrot  feathers and long red feathers of the bird of paradise. Plate 45,  Fig. 2, is made of cassowary feathers only. This ornament is worn in  front of the head, over the forehead, and is specially worn by chiefs.    Plate 46, Fig. 1, shows a head feather ornament which is peculiar  to the mountains. The crescent-shaped body of the ornament, which is  made of short feathers taken from the neck of the cassowary, is worn  in front over the forehead, and the cockade of hawk feathers stands  up over the head.    Plate 46, Fig. 2, shows a back ornament of cassowary feathers which  is specially intended to be worn by chiefs at dances. The custom is  to have from five to twelve of these ornaments hanging vertically  side by side, suspended to a horizontal stick, which is fastened on  the chief's back at the height of the shoulders, so that the feathers  hang like a mantle over his back. The mode in which feather ornaments  for the back are hung on sticks is seen in Plate 70, where a stick  with pendant ornaments is being held by two boys in front.    Plaited frames (Plate 47) are worn by men in connection with these head  feather ornaments. These frames are flat curved bands, rigid or nearly  so, generally forming half or nearly half a circle of an external  diameter of about 9 inches, and being about 1 inch in width. They  are worn at dances and on solemn occasions. They are placed round  the top of the forehead, not vertically, but with their upper edges  sloping obliquely forward, and have at their ends strings, which pass  over the ears and are tied at the back of the head. These frames help  to support the feather ornaments, and prevent them from falling down  over the face. They are made by men only. A groundwork of small split  cane or other material runs in parallel curved lines from end to end,  single pieces of the material being generally doubled back at the ends  so as to form several lines; and this is strengthened and ornamented  by interplaiting into it either split cane or some other material  obtained from the splitting of the inside fibre of a plant in the way  previously referred to. There are varieties of material and of pattern  worked up in different designs of interplaiting. Some of the materials  are uncoloured or merely the natural colour of the material, and others  are in two colours, generally brown or reddish-brown and yellow. These  frames display a considerable amount of variety of artistic design.    The feather erections used at special and important dances, and  especially those worn by chiefs, are enormous things, towering 6  or 12 feet above the wearer's head, and are generally larger than  those of Mekeo. They are held in a framework, which has an inverted  basket-shaped part to rest on the head, and downward pointing rods,  which are tied to the shoulders. The frames are to a great extent  similar to those of Mekeo, but, having a larger burden to bear, they  are more strongly made. These feather erections and their frames are  seen in Plate 70.    Here, as in other parts of New Guinea, both men and women, but  especially men, love to decorate themselves with bright flowers and  leaves and grasses, these being worn in the hair and in bunches stuck  into their belts, armlets and leg-bands, and indeed in any places  where they can be conveniently fastened.    It is not the practice with the Mafulu for mothers to wear the  umbilical cords of any of their children, though apparently the Kuni  people do so.              CHAPTER IV    Daily Life and Matters Connected with It      Daily Life.    The early morning finds the wife and young children and unmarried  daughters in the house. The husband has been sleeping either there  or in the _emone_ (clubhouse), but most probably the latter. The  unmarried sons are in the _emone_, except any very young ones, who  have not been formally admitted to it in a way which will be hereafter  described. The women cook the breakfast for the whole family inside the  house at about six or seven o'clock, and then take the food of the men  to the _emone_. After breakfast most of the men and women go off to the  gardens and the bush. The women's work there is chiefly the planting  of sweet potatoes, taro and other things, and cleaning the gardens;  and in the afternoon they get food from the gardens and firewood from  the bush, all of which they bring home to the village; also they have  to clear off the undergrowth from newly cleared bush. The men's work is  mainly the yam and banana and sugar-cane planting, each in its season,  and the cutting down of big trees and making fences, if they happen to  be opening out new garden land. They also sometimes help the women with  their work. Or they may have hunting expeditions in the bush, or go  off in fishing parties to the river. In all matters the men of Mafulu,  though lazy, are not so lazy as those of Mekeo and the coast. In the  middle of the day the women cook the meal for everyone in the gardens,  this being done on the spot, and there they all eat it. At three, four,  or five o'clock all the people of the village have returned to it,  except perhaps when they are very busy taking advantage of good weather  for making new clearings or other special work. In the evening they  have another meal cooked in the village. At every meal in the village  the pigs have to be fed also, these sharing the food of the people  themselves, or feeding on raw potatoes. Unless there is dancing going  on, or they are tempted by a fine moonlight night to sit out talking,  the people all terminate their routine day by going to bed early.    As regards the daily social conduct of the people among themselves,  I was told that the members of a family generally live harmoniously  together (subject as regards husbands and wives to the matters which  will be mentioned later), that children are usually treated kindly  and affectionately by their parents, and that there is very little  quarrelling within a village; and what I saw when I was among the  Mafulu people certainly seemed to confirm all this.    There are various detailed matters of daily life which will appear  under their appropriate headings; but I will here deal with a few  of them.            Food.    The vegetable foods of the Mafulu people are sweet potato and other  plants of the same type, yam and other foods of the same type, taro and  other foods of that type, banana of different sorts, sugar-cane, a kind  of wild native bean, a cultivated reed-like plant with an asparagus  flavour (what it is I do not know), several plants of the pumpkin and  cucumber type, one of them being very small, like a gherkin, fruit from  two different species of Pandanus, almonds, the fruit of the _malage_  (described later on), and others, both cultivated and wild. The  sugar-cane is specially eaten by them when working in the gardens. [49]    Their animal food consists of wild pig and, on occasions, village pig,  a small form of cassowary, kangaroo, a small kind of wallaby, kangaroo  rat, \"iguana,\" an animal called _gaivale_ (I could not find out what  this is), various wild birds, fish, eels, mice, a large species of  snake and other things.    Their staple drink is water, but when travelling they cut down a  species of bamboo, and drink the watery fluid which it contains. After  boiling any food in bamboo stems they drink the water which has been  used for the purpose, and which has become a sort of thin flavoured  soup.    Betel-chewing is apparently not indulged in by these people as  extensively as it is done in Mekeo and on the coast; but they like it  well enough, and for a month or so before a big feast, during which  period they are under a strict taboo restriction as to food, they  indulge in it largely. The betel used by them is not the cultivated  form used in Mekeo and on the coast, but a wild species, only about  half the size of the other; and the lime used is not, as in Mekeo  and on the coast, made by grinding down sea-shells, but is obtained  from the mountain stone, which is ground down to a powder. The gourds  (Plate 51, Figs. 6 and 7) in which the lime is carried are similar to  those used in Mekeo, except that usually they are not ornamented, or,  if they are so, the ornamentation is only done in simple straight-lined  geometric patterns. The spatulae are sometimes very simply and rudely  decorated. The people spit out the betel after chewing, instead of  swallowing it, as is the custom in Mekeo.      Cooking and Eating and Their Utensils.    They have no cooking utensils, other than the simple pieces of bamboo  stem, which they use for boiling.    Their usual methods of cooking are roasting and boiling.    Roasting is usually effected by making a fire, letting it die  down into red-hot ashes, and then putting the food without wrap or  covering into the ashes, turning it from time to time. They also  roast by holding the food on sticks in the flame of the burning fire,  turning it occasionally. Stone cooking is adopted for pig and other  meats. They make a big fire, on the top of which they spread the  stones; when the stones are hot enough, they remove some of them,  place the meat without wrap or covering on the others, then place the  removed stones on the meat, and finally pile on these stones a big  covering of leaves to keep in the heat. Stone cooking in the gardens  is done in a slightly different way; there they dig in the ground a  round hole about 1 foot deep and from 1 1/2 to 2 feet in diameter, and  in this hole they make their fire, on which they pile their stones;  and the rest of the process is the same as before. This hole-making  process is never adopted in the village. The only reason for it which  was suggested was that the method was quicker, and that in the gardens  they are in a hurry. Of course, holes of this sort dug in the open  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#12)"],[1,"-225). The  familiar anecdote of the vizier interpreting to Mahmud the conversation  of the two owls is told in Nidami's _Machsan-ul-asrar_ (ed. Bland, pp.  48-50), where, however, Anusirvan is the sultan. The title reads:  [Arabic].[172] \"Abu Rihan\" (i.e. Albiruni) is taken from d'Herb. I. 45 and iv. 697.    Then follow stories from the period of the Saljuks: \"Des Sultan's  Schlaf,\" p. 224 (Vullers, _Gesch. der Seldsch._ pp. 43, 44); \"Nitham  Elmulks Ehre,\" p. 228 (ibid. pp. 228-230); \"Nitham Elmulks Fall,\" p. 229  (ib. pp. 123-125 and pp. 128-132); \"Die unglueckliche Stunde,\" p. 232  (ibid. pp. 153, 154). \"Die unterthaenigen Wuerfel,\" p. 227, is from the  _Haft Qulzum_ (_Gram. u. Poet. der Perser_, pp. 366, 367). The stories  of Alp Arslan and Romanus, p. 225, and of Malaksah's prayer, p. 228, are  not given by Mirchvand, but occur in the works of Deguignes, Gibbon,  Malcolm and d'Herbelot.[173] The story of the death of Sultan Muhammad  (in 1159 A.D.), p. 232, is in Deguignes, ii. 260, 261.    Then we get stories from the period of the Mongol invasion. \"Die  prophezeite Weltzerstoerung,\" p. 237, the legend of Jingis Chan's birth,  is in the _Tarich-i-Yamini_ (_Notices et Extr._ iv. pp. 408, 409). The  material for the poems concerning Muhammad Xvarazm Sah, p. 237, and his  brave son Jalal ud-din, pp. 240, 241, is found in the work of Deguignes  (op. cit. ii. p. 274 and pp. 280-283). Finally we are carried even to  India and listen to the story of the unhappy queen Raziyah, p. 255, who  was murdered at Delhi by her own generals in 1239 A.D.[174]    A few anecdotes about Persian poets are also given. Thus  \"Dichterkampf,\" p 233, gives the amusing story of the literary contest  between Anvari and Rasid, surnamed Vatvat \"the swallow\" (Hammer, _Red._  p. 121; David Price, _Chronological Retrospect_, London, 1821, ii. 391,  392), and on p. 243 we are told how Kamal ud-din curses his native city  Ispahan and how the curse was fulfilled. (Hammer, _Red._ p. 159.)    The seventh book contains two of Rueckert's best known parables, the  famous \"Es ging ein Mann im Syrerland,\" p. 303,[175] and \"Der Sultan  laesst den Mewlana rufen,\" p. 305 (_Red._ p. 338).           *       *       *       *       *    It will be noticed that the Oriental poems which we have thus far  discussed were mainly derived from Arabic and Persian sources. We may  now turn our attention to a collection in which Rueckert's studies on  matters connected with India are also represented.    This collection _Brahmanische Erzaehlungen_, published in the year 1839  (vol. iii.), does not, however, as its title might lead us to suppose,  consist exclusively of Indic material. Some of the poems are not even  Oriental; \"Annikas Freier,\" p. 217, for example, is from the Finnic. Of  others, again, the subject-matter, whether originally Oriental or not,  has long ago become the common property of the world's fable-literature,  as, for instance, \"Weisheit aus Vogelmund,\" p. 239, the story of which  may be found in the _Gesta Romanorum_, and in French, English and  German, as well as in Persian, fable-books.[176] Some are from Arabic  sources, as from the Thousand and One Nights, e.g. \"Der schwanke  Ankergrund,\" p. 357,[177] \"Elephant, Nashorn und Greif,\" p. 367,[178]  \"Die Kokosnuesse,\" p. 359.[179] The poem \"Rechtsanschauung in Afrika,\" p.  221, is a Hebrew parable from the Talmud and had been already used by  Herder.[180]    A considerable number of the poems contain nothing but Persian material.  Thus \"Wettkampf,\" p. 197, is from the _Gulistan_ (i. 28; K.S. tr. p.  27); and from the same source we have \"Rache fuer den Steinwurf,\" p. 219  (_Gul._ i. 22; K.S. 21), \"Fluch und Segen,\" p. 234 (_Gul._ i. 1), and  \"Busurgimihr,\" p. 225 (_Gul._ i. 32; K.S. 31). \"Die Bibliothek des  Koenigs,\" p. 405, is from the _Baharistan_ (K.S., p. 31; _Red._ p. 338).  Three episodes from the _Iskandar Namah_ are narrated on pp. 214-217:  the story of the invention of the mirror (_Isk._ tr. Clark, xxiii. p.  247), the battle between the two cocks (ibid., xxii. p. 234 seq.), and  the message of Dara to Alexander with the latter's reply (ibid. xxiv. p.  263).[181]    On p. 329 Rueckert offers a free, but faithful, even if abridged version  of selected passages from the introductory chapters of Nidami's work  (_Isk._ tr. Clarke, canto ii, p. 18 seq. and canto vii, p. 53 seq.). In  \"Kiess der Reue,\" p. 421, he paraphrases the episode of Alexander's  search for the fountain of life from the _Shah Namah_ (tr. Mohl, v. pp.  177, 178). The story of Bahramgur in the same work (tr. Mohl, v, pp.  488-492) appears in \"Allwo nicht Zugethan,\" p. 397. It is not taken from  Firdausi, for it relates the story somewhat differently, and introduces  a love-episode of which the epic knows nothing.[182] Again, \"Der in die  Stadt verschlagene Kurde,\" p. 229, is an anecdote which Rueckert had  already translated in the _Haft Qulzum_ (see his _Poet. u. Rhet. der  Perser_, pp. 72-74), while \"Gluecksgueter,\" p. 233, may have been  suggested by a story of Attar which he published afterwards (1860, ZDMG.  vol. 14, p. 286). Some anecdotes of Persian princes or poets are also  utilized, e.g. \"Das Kuechenfeldgeraethe des Fuersten Amer,\" p. 226 (d'Herb.  iv. 459; Malcolm i. p. 155), \"Der Spiegel des Koenigs,\" p. 223  (Deguignes, ii. 171), and the story of Jami and the mulla, p. 224 (M.  Kuka, _The Wit and Humour of the Persians_, Bombay, 1894, pp. 165, 166).  In one poem, \"Ormuzd und Ahriman,\" p. 344, an Avestan subject is  treated, the later Parsi doctrine of _zrvan akarana_.[183]           *       *       *       *       *    The great majority of the poems in this collection are concerned with  India, its literature, mythology, religious customs, geography and  history, and it will be convenient for our purpose to discuss them under  these heads.    In the first group, that which takes its material from Sanskrit  literature, we meet with the story of the flood, p. 298, from the  _Mahabharata_ (Vana Parva, 187) and the story of Rama's exploits and  Sita's love, p. 268, from the _Ramayana_. Also a number of fables from  the _Hitopadesa_ or _Pancatantra_ occur, e.g. that of the greedy jackal,  p. 249, familiar from Lafontaine (_Hit._ i. 6; _Panc._ ii. 3), and that  of the lion, the mouse and the cat, p. 250 (_Hit._ ii. 3). The story of  the ungrateful man and the grateful animals, p. 252, is found in the  _Kathasaritsagara_ (tr. Tawney, ii. pp. 103-108; cf. Pali version in  _Rasavahini_, Wollheim, _Die National-Lit. saemtlicher Voelker des  Orients_, Berl. 1873, vol. i. p. 370). \"Katerstolz und Fuchses Rath,\" p.  243, has for its prototype the fable of the mouse changed into a girl in  _Pancatantra_ (iv. 9; cf. the story of the ambitious Candala maid in  _Kathas._ tr. Tawney, ii. p. 56). King Raghu's generosity to Varatantu's  pupil Kautsa, as narrated in the _Raghuvamsa_ (ch. v.), is the subject  of a poem on p. 402. Two famous pieces from the _Upanisad_-literature  are also offered: the story of how Jajnavalkya overcame nine contestants  in debate at King Janaka's court and won the prize consisting of one  thousand cows with gold-tipped horns, p. 247, from the _Brhadaranyaka  Up._ iii. (see Deussen, _Sechzig Upan. uebers._ Leipz. 1897, p. 428  seq.), and the story of Naciketas' choice, p. 403, from the _Kathaka  Upanisad_. To this group belong also versions of Bhartrhari, p. 337  (_Nitis._ 15) and p. 338 (_Nitis._ 67).           *       *       *       *       *    In the mythological group we have two poems telling of the history of  Krsna, as given in the great _Bhagavata Purana_. The first one, \"Die  Weltliebessonne im Palast des Gottes Krischna,\" p. 246, gives the legend  of the god's interview with the Sage Narada (_Bhagav._ Nirnaya Sag.  Press, Bombay 1898, Lib. x. c. 69; tr. Dutt, Calcutta, 1895, pp.  298-302) with a close somewhat different from that of the Sanskrit  original. The second one narrates the romance of the poor Brahman  Sudaman, who pays a visit to the god and is enriched by the latter's  generosity (_Bhagav._ x. c. 80, 81; tr. Dutt, pp. 346-355. For the  Hindostanee version in the _Premsagar_, see Wollheim, op. cit. i. p.  421). In the Sanskrit the story is not so ideal as in Rueckert's poem.  The poor Brahman is urged on to the visit, not by affection for the  playmate of his youth, but rather by the prosaic appeals of his wife;  yet, though the motive be different, the result is the same. Besides  these, we find the legend of Kama, the Hindu Cupid, burned to ashes by  Siva's third eye for attempting to interrupt the god's penance, p. 266  (_Ramay._ i. c. 23, _Kumaras._ iii. v. 70 seq.), and Rueckert manages to  introduce and to explain all the epithets, _Kamadeva_, _kandarpa_,  _smara_, _manmatha_, _hrcchaya_, _ananga_, which Sanskrit authors bestow  upon their Cupid. We also have legends of the cause of the eclipses of  sun and moon, p. 365, of the origin of caste, p. 347 (_Manu_ i. 87), of  the fabulous mountain Meru in Jambudvipa, p. 285, of the quarrelsome  mountains Innekonda and Bugglekonda, p. 321 (Ritter _Erdkunde_, iv. 2,  pp. 472, 473). The winding course of the Indus is explained by a typical  Hindu saint-story, p. 335, similar to that told of the Yamuna and Rama  in the _Visnu Purana_ (tr. Wilson, ed. Dutt, Calc. 1894, p. 386).           *       *       *       *       *    Many of the poems describe religious customs practised in India. Of such  customs the practice of asceticism in its different forms is one of the  most striking and could not fail to engage the poet's attention. Thus  the peculiar fast known as _Candrayana_, \"moon-penance,\" is the subject  of a poem, p. 278; so also \"Titanische Bussandacht,\" p. 283, has for its  theme the belief of the Hindus in the supernatural power conferred by  excessive penance, as exemplified by the legend of Sakuntala's birth.  The practice of _pancatapas_, \"the five fires\" (_Manu_, vi. 23. See  Monier Williams, _Indian Wisdom_,"]]]
