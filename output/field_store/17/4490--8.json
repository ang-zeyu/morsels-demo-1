Some dry flour is  then sprinkled over the top, and it is covered up with cloths.    In this situation it is left about three hours. It gradually swells and  breaks through the dry flour scattered on its surface. An additional  quantity of warm water, in which one ounce of alum is dissolved, is now  added, and the dough is made up into a paste as before; the whole is  then covered up. In this situation it is left for a few hours.    The whole is then intimately kneaded with more water for upwards of an  hour. The dough is cut into pieces with a knife, and penned to one side  of the trough; some dry flour is sprinkled over it, and it is left in  this state for about four hours. It is then kneaded again for  half-an-hour. The dough is now cut into pieces and weighed, in order to  furnish the requisite quantity for each loaf. The loaves are left in the  oven about two hours and a half. When taken out, they are carefully  covered up, to prevent as much as possible the loss of weight.[43]    The following account of making a sack, of five bushels of flour into  bread, is taken from Dr. P. Markham's Considerations on the Ingredients  used in the Adulteration of Bread Flour, and Bread, p. 21:         5 bushels of flour,       8 ounces of alum,[44]       4 lbs. of salt,       1/2 a gallon of yeast, mixed with about       3 gallons of water.                *       *       *       *       *                                                        lbs.

From experiments in which I have been employed, with the assistance of  skilful bakers, I am authorised to state, that without the addition of  alum, it does not appear possible to make white, light, and porous  bread, such as is used in this metropolis, unless the flour be of the  very best quality.    Another substance employed by fraudulent bakers, is subcarbonate of  ammonia. With this salt, they realise the important consideration of  producing light and porous bread, from spoiled, or what is technically  called _sour flour_. This salt which becomes wholly converted into a  gaseous state during the operation of baking, causes the dough to swell  up into air bubbles, which carry before them the stiff dough, and thus  it renders the dough porous; the salt itself is, at the same time,  totally volatilised during the operation of baking. Thus not a vestige  of carbonate of ammonia remains in the bread. This salt is also largely  employed by the biscuit and ginger-bread bakers.    Potatoes are likewise largely, and perhaps constantly, used by  fraudulent bakers, as a cheap ingredient, to enhance their profit. The  potatoes being boiled, are triturated, passed through a sieve, and  incorporated with the dough by kneading. This adulteration does not  materially injure the bread. The bakers assert, that the bad quality of  the flour renders the addition of potatoes advantageous as well to the  baker as to the purchaser, and that without this admixture in the  manufacture of bread, it would be impossible to carry on the trade of a  baker. But the grievance is, that the same price is taken for a potatoe  loaf, as for a loaf of genuine bread, though it must cost the baker  less.    I have witness, that five bushels of flour, three ounces of alum, six  pounds of salt, one bushel of potatoes boiled into a stiff paste, and  three quarts of yeast, with the requisite quantity of water, produce a  white, light, and highly palatable bread.    Such are the artifices practised in the preparation of bread,[45] and it  must be allowed, on contrasting them with those sophistications  practised by manufacturers of other articles of food, that they are  comparatively unimportant. However, some medical men have no hesitation  in attributing many diseases incidental to children to the use of eating  adulterated bread; others again will not admit these allegations: they  persuade themselves that the small quantity of alum added to the bread  (perhaps upon an average, from eight to ten grains to a quartern loaf,)  is absolutely harmless.    Dr. Edmund Davy, Professor of Chemistry, at the Cork Institution, has  communicated the following important facts to the public concerning the  manufacture of bread.    \"The carbonate of magnesia of the shops, when well mixed with flour, in  the proportion of from twenty to forty grains to a pound of flour,  materially improves it for the purpose of making bread.    \"Loaves made with the addition of carbonate of magnesia, rise well in  the oven; and after being baked, the bread is light and spongy, has a  good taste, and keeps well. In cases when the new flour is of an  indifferent quality, from twenty to thirty grains of carbonate of  magnesia to a pound of the flour will considerably improve the bread.  When the flour is of the worst quality, forty grains to a pound of flour  seem necessary to produce the same effect.    \"As the improvement in the bread from new flour depends upon the  carbonate of magnesia, it is necessary that care should be taken to mix  it intimately with the flour, previous to the making of the dough.    \"Mr. Davy made a great number of comparative experiments with other  substances, mixed in different proportions with new bread flour. The  fixed alkalies, both in their pure and carbonated state, when used in  small quantity, to a certain extent were found to improve the bread made  from new flour; but no substance was so efficacious in this respect as  carbonate of magnesia.    \"The greater number of his experiments were performed on the worst new  _seconds_ flour Mr. Davy could procure. He also made some trials on  _seconds_ and _firsts_ of different quality. In some cases the results  were more striking and satisfactory than in others; but in every  instance the improvement of the bread, by carbonate of magnesia, was  obvious.    \"Mr. Davy observes, that a pound of carbonate of magnesia would be  sufficient to mix with two hundred and fifty-six pounds of new flour, or  at the rate of thirty grains to the pound. And supposing a pound of  carbonate of magnesia to cost half-a-crown, the additional expense would  be only half a farthing in the pound of flour.    \"Mr. Davy conceives that not the slightest danger can be apprehended  from the use of such an innocent substance, as the carbonate of  magnesia, in such small proportion as is necessary to improve bread from  new flour.\"      METHOD OF DETECTING THE PRESENCE OF ALUM IN BREAD.    Pour upon two ounces of the suspected bread, half a pint of boiling  distilled water; boil the mixture for a few minutes, and filter it  through unsized paper. Evaporate the fluid, to about one fourth of its  original bulk, and let gradually fall into the clear fluid a solution of  muriate of barytes. If a _copious_ white precipitate ensues, which does  not disappear by the addition of _pure_ nitric acid, the presence of  alum may be suspected. Bread, made without alum, produces, when assayed  in this manner, merely a very slight precipitate, which originates from  a minute portion of sulphate of magnesia contained in all common salt of  commerce; and bread made with salt freed from sulphate of magnesia,  produces an infusion with water, which does not become disturbed by the  barytic test.    Other means of detecting all the constituent parts of alum, namely, the  alumine, sulphuric acid, and potash, so as to render the presence of the  alum unequivocal, will readily suggest itself to those who are familiar  with analytical chemistry; namely: one of the readiest means is, to  decompose the vegetable matter of the bread, by the action of chlorate  of potash, in a platina crucible, at a red heat, and then to assay the  residuary mass--by means of muriate of barytes, for sulphuric acid; by  ammonia, for alumine; and by muriate of platina, for potash[46]. The  above method of detecting the presence of alum, must therefore be taken  with some limitation.    There is no unequivocal test for detecting in a _ready manner_ the  presence of alum in bread, on account of the impurity of the common salt  used in the making of bread. If we could, in the ordinary way of bread  making, employ common salt, absolutely free from foreign saline  substances, the mode of detecting the presence of alum, or at least one  of its constituent parts, namely, the sulphuric acid, would be very  easy. Some conjecture may, nevertheless, be formed of the presence, or  absence, of alum, by assaying the infusion of bread in the manner  stated, p. 109, and comparing the assay with the results afforded by an  infusion of home-made or household bread, known to be genuine, and  actually assayed in a similar manner.

This super-common-law position of the Prussian official is a fatal  incentive to the aggravating exaggeration of his importance, and to  the indifference of his behavior to the private citizen. There may be  officials who are uninfluenced by this sheltered position, indeed I  know personally many who are, but there is equally no doubt that many  succumb to arrogance and lethargy as a consequence.    How thoroughly Prussia is covered by a network of officialdom, is  further discovered when it is known, that the entire area of Prussia  is some twenty thousand square miles less than that of the State of  California. The whole Prussian doctrine of local self-government, too,  is entirely different from ours. Their idea is that self-government is  the performance by locally elected bodies of the will of the state,  not necessarily of the locality which elects them. Local authorities,  whether elected or not, are supposed to be primarily the agents of the  state, and only secondarily the agents of the particular locality they  serve. In Prussia, all provincial and circle assemblies and communal  councils, may be dissolved by royal decree, hence even these elected  assemblies may only serve their constituencies at the will and  pleasure of the central authority.    It would avail little to go into minute details in describing the  government of Prussia; this slight sketch of the electoral system, and  of the centralization of the government, suffices to show two things  that it is particularly my purpose to make clear. One is the  preponderating influence of Prussia in the empire, due to the  maintenance of power in a single person; and the other is to show how  ridiculously futile it is to refer to Prussia as an example of the  success of social legislation. The state ownership of railroads, old-age  pensions, accident and sickness insurance, and the like are one  thing in Prussia which is a close corporation, and quite another in  any community or country under democratic government. What takes place  in Prussia would certainly not take place in America or in England. To  draw inferences from a state governed as is Prussia, for application  to such democratic communities as America or England, is as valuable  as to argue from the habits of birds, that such and such a treatment  would succeed with fish.    It was with this autocratic Prussia at his back, that the greatest man  Germany has produced, succeeded in bringing about German unity and the  foundation of the German Empire. As the representative of Prussia in  the Diet, as her ambassador to Russia, and to France, he gained the  insight into the European situation which led him to hold as his  political creed, that only by blood and iron, and not by declamations  and resolutions, could Germany be united.    \"During the time I was in office,\" he writes, \"I advised three wars,  the Danish, the Bohemian, and the French; but every time I have first  made clear to myself whether the war, if successful, would bring a  prize of victory worth the sacrifices which every war requires, and  which now are so much greater than in the last century. ... I have  never looked at international quarrels which can only be settled by a  national war from the point of view of the Goettingen student code; ...  but I have always considered simply their reaction on the claim of  the German people, in equality with the other great states and powers  of Europe, to lead an autonomous political life, so far as is possible  on the basis of our peculiar national capacity.\" In 1863 he writes to  von der Goltz, then German ambassador in Paris: \"The question is  whether we are a great power or a state in the German federation, and  whether we are conformably to the former quality to be governed by a  monarch, or, as in the latter case would be at any rate admissible, by  professors, district judges, and the gossips of the small towns. The  pursuit of the phantom of popularity in Germany which we have been  carrying on for the last forty years has cost us our position in  Germany and in Europe; and we shall not win this back again by  allowing ourselves to be carried away by the stream in the persuasion  that we are directing its course, but only by standing firmly on our  legs and being, first of all, a great power and a German federal state  afterward.\"    After Napoleon and the interminable elocutionary squabbles of the  German states, first, for constitutional rights, and, second, for some  basis of unity among themselves, which were the two main streams of  political activity, there were three main steps in the formation of  the now existing empire: first, in 1866, the North German  Confederation under the presidency of Prussia and excluding Austria;  second, the conclusion of treaties, 1866-1867, between the North  German Confederation and the south German states; third, the formal  union of the north and south German states as an empire in 1871.    Although the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist legally in 1806, it is  to be remembered that as a fiction weighing still upon the imagination  of German politicians, it did not wholly disappear until the war  between Prussia and Austria, for then Prussia fought not only Austria  but Bavaria, Wuertemberg, Saxony, Hanover, Nassau, Baden, and the two  Hesse states, and at Sadowa in Bohemia the war was settled by the  defeat of the Austrians before they could be joined by these allies,  who were disposed of in detail. Frankfort was so harshly treated that  the mayor hanged himself, and the Prussianizing of Hanover has never  been entirely forgiven, and the claimants to the throne in exile are  still the centre of a political party antagonistic to Prussia. The  taking over of north Schleswig, of Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, and Nassau  by Prussia after the Austrian war was according to the rough  arbitrament of conquest. \"Our right,\" replied Bismarck to the just  criticism of this spoliation, \"is the right of the German nation to  exist, to breathe, to be united; it is the right and the duty of  Prussia to give the German nation the foundation necessary for its  existence.\" In taking Alsace-Lorraine from France, Bismarck insisted  that this was a necessary barrier against France and that Germany's  possession of Metz and Strassburg were necessities of the situation  also.    The history of German unity is the biography of Bismarck. Otto Eduard  Leopold von Bismarck was born in Schoenhausen, in that Mark of  Brandenburg which was the cradle of the Prussian monarchy, on the  first of April, 1815. His grandfather fought at Rossbach under the  great Frederick. He was confirmed in Berlin in 1831 by the famous  pastor and theologian, Schleiermacher, and maintained all his life  that without his belief in God he would have found no reason for his  patriotism or for any serious work in life.    He matriculated as a student of law and science at Goettingen in May,  1832, and later at Berlin in 1834. He was a tall, large-limbed, blue-eyed  young giant, the boldest rider, the best swordsman, and the  heartiest drinker of his day. He is still looked upon in Germany as  the typical hero of corps student life, and his pipe, or his Schlaeger,  or his cap, or his Kneipe jacket is preserved as the relic of a saint.  His was not the tepid virtue born of lack of vitality. One has but to  remember Augustine and Origen and Ignatius Loyola, to recall the fact  that the preachers of salvation, the best of them, have generally had  themselves to tame before they mastered the world.    This youth Bismarck must have had some vigorous battles with Bismarck  before he married Johanna Friederika Charlotte Dorothea Eleanore von  Puttkamer, July 28, 1847, much against the wishes of her parents, and  settled down to his life-work. As was said of John Pym, \"he thought it  part of a man's religion to see that his country was well governed,\"  and his country became his passion. Like most men of intense feeling,  he loved few people and loyally hated many. More men feared and envied  him than liked him. His wife, his sister, his king, a student friend,  Keyserling, and the American, Motley, shared with his country his  affection. Germany might well take it to heart that it was Motley the  American who was of all men dearest to her giant creator. The same  type of American would serve her better to-day than any other, did she  only know it! In 1849 he was elected to the Prussian Chamber. In 1852  a whiff of the old dare-devil got loose, and he fought a duel with  Freiherr von Vincke.    In 1852 he is sent on his first responsible mission to Vienna, and  found there the traditions of the Metternich diplomacy still ruling.  What Napoleon had said of Metternich he no doubt remembered: \"Il ment  trop. Il faut mentir quelquefois, mais mentir tout le temps c'est  trop!\" for he adopted quite the opposite policy in his own diplomatic  dealings.    In 1855 he became a member of the upper house of Prussia, and in 1859  is sent as minister to St. Petersburg. In May, 1862, he is sent as  minister to Paris, and learns to know, and not greatly to admire, the  third Napoleon and his court.    On the 23d of September, 1862, he is appointed Staats-minister, and a  week later thunders out his famous blood-and-iron speech. On October  the 8th, 1862, he is definitely named Minister President and Minister  for Foreign Affairs.    William I had succeeded his brother as king. He was a soldier and a  believer in the army, and wished to spend more on it, and to lengthen  the time of service with the colors to three years. The legislature  opposed these measures. A minister was needed who could bully the  legislature, and Bismarck was chosen for the task. He spent the  necessary money despite the legislative opposition, pleading that a  legislature that refused to vote necessary supplies had"]]]
