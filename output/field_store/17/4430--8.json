There was  but one distinguishing mark that I noticed, and this is wanting here.  The light of the torch fell upon the handle of a dagger in his girdle.  I saw it but for a moment, but I caught the gleam of gems. It was only  a passing impression, but I could swear that he carried a small gold or  yellow metal-handled dagger, and I believe that it was set with gems,  but to this I should not like to swear.\"    \"Produce the dagger found upon the dead man,\" one of the council said  to an official.    And the officer produced a small dagger with a fine steel blade and  gold handle, thickly encrusted with gems.    \"Is this the dagger?\" the senator asked Francis.    \"I cannot say that it is the dagger,\" Francis replied; \"but it closely  resembles it, if it is not the same.\"    \"You have no doubt, I suppose, seeing that wound on the temple, the  dagger found in the girdle, and the fact that the body has evidently  only been a few days in the water, that this is the man whom you struck  down in the fray on the canal?\"    \"No, signor, I have no doubt whatever that it is the same person.\"    \"That will do,\" the council said. \"You can retire; and we thank you, in  the name of justice, for the evidence you have given.\"    Francis was led back to the gondola, and conveyed to his father's  house. An hour later Signor Polani arrived.    \"The matter is finished,\" he said, \"I cannot say satisfactorily to me,  for the punishment is wholly inadequate to the offence, but at any rate  he has not got off altogether unpunished. After you left, we passed  from the prison into the palace, and then the whole council assembled,  as before, in the council chamber. I may tell you that the body which  was found was that of a cousin and intimate of Ruggiero Mocenigo. The  two have been constantly together since the return of the latter from  Constantinople. It was found, by inquiry at the house of the young  man's father, that he left home on the evening upon which the attack  was committed, saying that he was going to the mainland, and might not  be expected to return for some days.    \"The council took it for granted, from the wound in his head, and the  fact that a leech has testified that the body had probably been in the  water about three days, that he was the man that was stunned by your  blow, and drowned in the canal. Ruggiero urged that the discovery in no  way affected him; and that his cousin had, no doubt, attempted to carry  off my daughter on his own account. There was eventually a division  among the council on this point, but Maria was sent for, and on being  questioned, testified that the young man had never spoken to her, and  that, indeed, she did not know him even by sight; and the majority  thereupon came to the conclusion that he could only have been acting as  an instrument of Ruggiero's.    \"We were not in the apartment while the deliberation was going on, but  when we returned the president announced that, although there was no  absolute proof of Ruggiero's complicity in the affair, yet that,  considering his application for my daughter's hand, his threats on my  refusal to his request, his previous character, and his intimacy with  his cousin, the council had no doubt that the attempt had been made at  his instigation, and therefore sentenced him to banishment from Venice  and the islands for three years.\"    \"I should be better pleased if they had sent him back to  Constantinople, or one of the islands of the Levant,\" Mr. Hammond said.  \"If he is allowed to take up his abode on the mainland, he may be only  two or three miles away, which, in the case of a man of his  description, is much too near to be pleasant for those who have  incurred his enmity.\"    \"That is true,\" Signor Polani agreed, \"and I myself, and my friends,  are indignant that he should not have been banished to a distance,  where he at least would have been powerless for fresh mischief. On the  other hand, his friends will doubtless consider that he has been hardly  treated. However, as far as my daughters are concerned, I will take  good care that he shall have no opportunity of repeating his attempt;  for I have ordered them, on no account whatever, to be absent from the  palazzo after the shades of evening begin to fall, unless I myself am  with them; and I shall increase the number of armed retainers in the  house, by bringing some of my men on shore from a ship which arrived  last night in port. I cannot believe that even Ruggiero would have the  insolence to attempt to carry them off from the house by force; but  when one has to deal with a man like this, one cannot take too great  precautions.\"    \"I have already ordered my son, on no account, to be out after  nightfall in the streets. In his gondola I do not mind, for unless the  gondoliers wear badges, it is impossible to tell one boat from another  after dark. Besides, as he tells me, his boat is so fast that he has no  fear whatever of being overtaken, even if recognized and chased. But I  shall not feel comfortable so long as he is here, and shall send him  back to England on the very first occasion that offers.\"    \"I trust that no such occasion may occur just yet, Signor Hammond. I  should be sorry, indeed, for your son to be separated so soon from us.  We must talk the matter over together, and perhaps between us we may  hit on some plan by which, while he may be out of the reach of the  peril he has incurred on behalf of my family, he may yet be neither  wasting his time, nor altogether separated from us.\"    For the next fortnight Francis spent most of his time at the Palazzo  Polani. The merchant was evidently sincere in his invitation to him to  make his house his home; and if a day passed without the lad paying a  visit, would chide him gently for deserting them. He himself was  frequently present in the balcony, where the four young people--for  Matteo Giustiniani was generally of the party--sat and chatted  together, the gouvernante sitting austerely by, with at times a strong  expression of disapproval on her countenance at their laughter and  merriment, although--as her charges' father approved of the intimacy of  the girls with their young cousin and this English lad--she could offer  no open objections. In the afternoon, the party generally went for a  long row in a four-oared gondola, always returning home upon the  approach of evening.    To Francis this time was delightful. He had had no sister of his own;  and although he had made the acquaintance of a number of lads in  Venice, and had accompanied his father to formal entertainments at the  houses of his friends, he had never before been intimate in any of  their families. The gaiety and high spirits of the two girls, when they  were in the house, amused and pleased him, especially as it was in  contrast to the somewhat stiff and dignified demeanour which they  assumed when passing through the frequented canals in the gondola.    \"I do not like that woman Castaldi,\" Francis said one evening as, after  leaving the palazzo, Giuseppi rowed them towards the Palazzo  Giustiniani, where Matteo was to be landed.    \"Gouvernantes are not popular, as a class, with young men,\" Matteo  laughed.    \"But seriously, Matteo, I don't like her; and I am quite sure that, for  some reason or other, she does not like me. I have seen her watching  me, as a cat would watch a mouse she is going to spring on.\"    \"Perhaps she has not forgiven you, Francisco, for saving her two  charges, and leaving her to the mercy of their assailants.\"    \"I don't know, Matteo. Her conduct appeared to me, at the time, to be  very strange. Of course, she might have been paralysed with fright, but  it was certainly curious the way she clung to their dresses, and tried  to prevent them from leaving the boat.\"    \"You don't really think, Francis, that she wanted them to be captured?\"    \"I don't know whether I should be justified in saying as much as that,  Matteo, and I certainly should not say so to anyone else, but I can't  help thinking that such was the case. I don't like her face, and I  don't like the woman. She strikes me as being deceitful. She certainly  did try to prevent my carrying the girls off and, had not their dresses  given way in her hands, she would have done so. Anyhow, it strikes me  that Ruggiero must have had some accomplice in the house. How else  could he have known of the exact time at which they would be passing  along the Grand Canal? For, that the gondola was in waiting to dash out  and surprise them, there is no doubt.    \"I was asking Signora Giulia, the other day, how it was they were so  late, for she says that her father never liked their being out after  dusk in Venice, though at Corfu he did not care how late they were upon  the water. She replied that she did not quite know how it happened. Her  sister had said, some time before, that she thought it was time to be  going, but the gouvernante--who was generally very particular--had said  that there was no occasion to hurry, as their father knew where they  were, and would not be uneasy. She thought the woman must have mistaken  the time, and did not know how late it was.    \"Of course, this proves nothing. Still I own that, putting all the  things together, I have my suspicions.\"    \"It is certainly curious, Francisco, though I can hardly believe it  possible that the woman could be treacherous. She has been for some  years in the service of the family, and my cousin has every confidence  in her.\"    \"That may be, Matteo; but Ruggiero may have promised so highly that he  may have persuaded her to aid him. He could have afforded to be  generous, if he had been successful.\"    \"There is another thing, by the bye, Francisco, which did not strike me  at the time; but now you speak of it, may be another link in the chain.  I was laughing at Maria about their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],[0,"The Way of the Wild (#12)"],[1," he expected her  to get out of his way, which she did with feline and concentrated  remarks; and he--by the whiskers and talons!--the fool exposed his  back--turned his back openly, a thing no wild beast in its senses would  do, unless running away.  And that, for a cat who had waited close on  two hours for baby business that didn't turn up, had got most  unfashionably drenched, and had, moreover, in her time, tackled more  than one grown-up rabbit, which was considerably larger than any  hedgehog--that, I say, was, for the silver tabby, too much.    She sprang.  Rather, she executed two bounds, and somewhat unexpectedly  found herself on top of the hedgehog.  I say \"unexpectedly,\" because  she had hitherto bounded upon wild-folk who contrived mostly not to be  there.  This one contrived nothing, except to stop still.  And the cat  executed a third bound--_off_ the hedgehog, and rather more violently  and more quickly than the first two.  Also, she spat.    When she had got over the intense pain--and cats feel pain badly--of  sharp spines digging into her soft and tender forefoot-pads, she  stopped, about two yards away, and glared at the hedgehog as if he had  played off a foul upon her, and she was surprised to see that he was no  longer egg-shaped, but rolled up into himself like a ball, so to speak,  and utterly quiescent.  (I wonder if she remembered the little  wood-lice that she had so often amused herself playing with in idle  hours.  They rolled themselves up just like that.  Perhaps she thought  she'd come upon the Colossus of all the wood-lice.)  Anyway, after she  had spat off at him all the vile remarks she could think of for the  moment, without producing any more reply than she would get from the  average stone, she came back, drawn with curiosity as by strings.    The hedgehog did not move; there was no need.  It was for the cat to  make the next move--if she chose.  He did not care.  All things were  one to him, and all the views which he presented to the world were  points, a _cheval-de-frise_, a coiled ball of barbed wire, a living  Gibraltar, what you will, but, anyway, practically impregnable; and the  beggar knew it.  \"He who believeth doth not make haste\"--that seemed to  be his motto, and he had, by the same token, a fine facility for  withstanding a siege.    He felt the cat, that cat who did not know hedgehogs, pat him  tentatively.  Then he heard her swearing softly and tensely at the  painful result.  She did not pat again--at least, only once, and, in  spite of care, that hurt her worse than ever.  Then she began growling,  low and beastily--for all the cat tribe have a horrible growl; you may  have noticed it.  Perhaps the hedgehog smiled.  I don't know.  He knew  that growl, anyhow; had heard it before--the anger of utter  exasperation.  He was an exasperating brute, too, for he never said  anything, only shut himself up, and let others do the arguing, if they  were fools enough to do so.    Suddenly he heard the growl stop.  Followed a tense pause, during which  he tightened his back-muscles under his spines, and tucked himself in,  to meet any coming shock, more tightly than ever.  Followed the pause a  short warning hiss, jerked out almost in fright, it seemed--that cat's  hiss that is only a bluff, and meant to imitate a snake--a sudden  explosion of snarls, and a thud.  A fractional silence, then a perfect  boil-over of snarls, and thud upon thud.    Now, our friend hedgehog was an old hand, and he had heard many and  curious sounds take place outside himself, so to speak; but, all the  same, he was just tickled to death to know what, in claws and whiskers,  was happening out there in the leering moonlight now; so much so,  indeed, that at last he risked it, and took a furtive peep out of a  chink in himself, as it were.  And what he saw might have amazed him,  if he had not been a hedgehog and scarcely ever amazed at anything.  He  just got a snapshot view of the cat's fine ringed tail whirling round  and round as she balanced herself on the swerve, vanishing into the  ghostly moonlight haze of the night; and in front of him, close beside  him, squatting, stare-eyed and phlegmatic, he saw the form of a big,  gaunt, old doe-rabbit.  And I think he knew what had happened.  He  seemed to, anyway, and remained rolled up.    Rabbits are thoughtless, headstrong, headlong, hopeless, helpless  cowards as a race and a rule.  \"The heart of a rabbit,\" they say in  France, speaking of a coward.  But all races and rules have exceptions.  Occasionally the exceptions are old buck-rabbits, who know a thing or  two; but more often they are old doe-rabbits with young.  And, mark  you, from the point of view of those wild-folk, there may be easier  rough handfuls to tackle than old doe-rabbits with young.  This one had  simply streaked out of the night from nowhere--and behind--and knocked  the cat flying before she knew.  Then, ere ever the feline could gather  her wits, the old doe had descended upon her with an avalanche of  blows--punches they were with the forefeet, all over the head and the  nose, where a cat hates to be hit--and all so swiftly, so irresistibly,  that that cat had never been given a chance to consider before she was  stampeded into the night.  It was the silver tabby's first experience  of Mrs. Rabbit doing the devoted-mother act, and, by the look of  her--tail only--and the speed at which she was going, it appeared most  likely that it would be her last.    [Illustration: \"This one had simply streaked out of the night from  nowhere\"]    Meanwhile the old doe-rabbit sat there in the moonlight as immovable  and impassive as a Buddha, and the hedgehog, peering at her, guessed  that the time to unroll was not yet.  He knew that it would hurt any  one to attack him; the cat knew it; all rabbits in their senses knew  it; but was that mother-rabbit in her senses?  He concluded to lie low  and remain a fortress, therefore.    Then, after waiting about five minutes, as if she knew that cats  sometimes steal back, the old doe-rabbit came to a \"stop\" quite close  to the hedgehog, and went in.  She remained there some time, during  which a fox came by and sniffed at the hedgehog, but was quite wise as  to the foolishness of doing more; and a deadly, curved-backed,  flat-headed little murderer of a stoat galloped by, and sniffed too,  but was no bigger fool than the fox, and went his way.    Both missed the \"stop\" by about two yards, though I don't know what  would have happened if they had found it.  Digging and death in the  former case, and battle and blood in the latter, perhaps.  But no  matter, they passed on their unlawful occasions; and half-an-hour after  the going of the stoat the old doe-rabbit came out, and dissolved into  the moon-haze.    Then the hedgehog came out, too--of himself, and--well, dissolved into  the \"stop.\"    What happened in there it was too dark to see, but not to hear; and  what one could hear was--pitiful.  He was there some time, for your  hedgehog rarely hurries; and when he came out again, his little pig's  eyes gleaming red under their spined cowl, it was with the same  snuffling, softly grunting deliberation with which he had gone in; but  the pale moon, that showed the gleam in his eyes, showed also blood on  his snout, and on the bristles of his forefeet, blood.    Then, slowly, snorting, sniffing very audibly--as loud as a big dog  often does--grunting softly in an undertone, as if talking to himself,  he departed, rustling through the grass, leaving an irregular winding  track behind in the dew and the gossamer, as he searched, eternally  searched, for food.    The hedgehog moved through the night as if he owned it and had no fear  of anything on earth; but many, it would seem, had cause to fear him.  He turned and snorted, and snatched up a slug.  Three very quick and  suggestive--quite audible--scrunches, and it was gone.  He described a  half-circle, sniffing very loudly, and chopped up a grub.  He paused  for a fraction to nose out a beetle, and disposed of it with the same  quick three or four chopping scrunches.  (It sounded rather like a  child eating toast-crusts.)  He continued, always wandering devious,  always very busy and ant-like, always snorting loudly; grabbed another  beetle, and then a worm--all by scent, apparently--and reached the  hedge-ditch, where, in the pitch-darkness, he could still be heard  snorting and scrunching hapless insects, slugs, and worms at scarcely  more than one-minute intervals.  And he never stopped.  He seemed to  have been appointed by Nature as a sort of machine, a spiked \"tank,\" to  sniff tirelessly about, reducing the surplus population of pests, as if  he were under a curse--as, indeed, the whole of the great order of  little beasts to which he belonged, the Insectivora, are--which,  afflicting him with an insatiable hunger, drove him everlastingly to  hunt blindly through the night for gastronomic horrors, and to eat 'em.  Anyway, he did it, and in doing it seemed to make himself worthy of the  everlasting thanks and protection of the people who owned that  land--thanks which to date he had never received.    Strange to say, he never stopped of his own free-will, though he was  stopped: once when he walked up to a man kneeling--and he was a  poacher--and did not see him till, if I may so put it, the man coughed,  when he ran like winkle into the hedge, and promptly became a ball for  ten minutes; and once when he came upon a low, long, sinister, big, and  grunting shadow, which again, if I be allowed the term, he did not see,  though quite close, till he heard it grunt, when he instantly jerked  himself into a ball on the spot and in the open.  In both cases it  seemed, on the face of it, more as if he had scented, rather than had  either seen or heard, the dangers, and in both cases he had come within  two yards of them--though they were not hidden--before scenting,  seeing, or hearing"]]]
