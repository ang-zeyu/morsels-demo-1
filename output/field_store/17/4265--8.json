She shut her eyes to make sure.  She was.    Josephine arched her spine, pulled up her knees, folded her arms so that  her fists came under her ears, and pressed her cheek hard against the  pillow.      Chapter 3.II.    Another thing which complicated matters was they had Nurse Andrews  staying on with them that week. It was their own fault; they had asked  her. It was Josephine's idea. On the morning--well, on the last morning,  when the doctor had gone, Josephine had said to Constantia, \"Don't you  think it would be rather nice if we asked Nurse Andrews to stay on for a  week as our guest?\"    \"Very nice,\" said Constantia.    \"I thought,\" went on Josephine quickly, \"I should just say this  afternoon, after I've paid her, 'My sister and I would be very pleased,  after all you've done for us, Nurse Andrews, if you would stay on for  a week as our guest.' I'd have to put that in about being our guest in  case--\"    \"Oh, but she could hardly expect to be paid!\" cried Constantia.    \"One never knows,\" said Josephine sagely.    Nurse Andrews had, of course, jumped at the idea. But it was a bother.  It meant they had to have regular sit-down meals at the proper times,  whereas if they'd been alone they could just have asked Kate if she  wouldn't have minded bringing them a tray wherever they were. And  meal-times now that the strain was over were rather a trial.    Nurse Andrews was simply fearful about butter. Really they couldn't  help feeling that about butter, at least, she took advantage of their  kindness. And she had that maddening habit of asking for just an inch  more of bread to finish what she had on her plate, and then, at the last  mouthful, absent-mindedly--of course it wasn't absent-mindedly--taking  another helping. Josephine got very red when this happened, and she  fastened her small, bead-like eyes on the tablecloth as if she saw a  minute strange insect creeping through the web of it. But Constantia's  long, pale face lengthened and set, and she gazed away--away--far  over the desert, to where that line of camels unwound like a thread of  wool...    \"When I was with Lady Tukes,\" said Nurse Andrews, \"she had such a dainty  little contrayvance for the buttah. It was a silvah Cupid balanced on  the--on the bordah of a glass dish, holding a tayny fork. And when you  wanted some buttah you simply pressed his foot and he bent down and  speared you a piece. It was quite a gayme.\"    Josephine could hardly bear that. But \"I think those things are very  extravagant\" was all she said.    \"But whey?\" asked Nurse Andrews, beaming through her eyeglasses. \"No  one, surely, would take more buttah than one wanted--would one?\"    \"Ring, Con,\" cried Josephine. She couldn't trust herself to reply.    And proud young Kate, the enchanted princess, came in to see what the  old tabbies wanted now. She snatched away their plates of mock something  or other and slapped down a white, terrified blancmange.    \"Jam, please, Kate,\" said Josephine kindly.    Kate knelt and burst open the sideboard, lifted the lid of the jam-pot,  saw it was empty, put it on the table, and stalked off.    \"I'm afraid,\" said Nurse Andrews a moment later, \"there isn't any.\"    \"Oh, what a bother!\" said Josephine. She bit her lip. \"What had we  better do?\"    Constantia looked dubious. \"We can't disturb Kate again,\" she said  softly.    Nurse Andrews waited, smiling at them both. Her eyes wandered, spying at  everything behind her eyeglasses. Constantia in despair went back to her  camels. Josephine frowned heavily--concentrated. If it hadn't been  for this idiotic woman she and Con would, of course, have eaten their  blancmange without. Suddenly the idea came.    \"I know,\" she said. \"Marmalade. There's some marmalade in the sideboard.  Get it, Con.\"    \"I hope,\" laughed Nurse Andrews--and her laugh was like a spoon tinkling  against a medicine-glass--\"I hope it's not very bittah marmalayde.\"      Chapter 3.III.    But, after all, it was not long now, and then she'd be gone for good.  And there was no getting over the fact that she had been very kind  to father. She had nursed him day and night at the end. Indeed, both  Constantia and Josephine felt privately she had rather overdone the not  leaving him at the very last. For when they had gone in to say good-bye  Nurse Andrews had sat beside his bed the whole time, holding his wrist  and pretending to look at her watch. It couldn't have been necessary.  It was so tactless, too. Supposing father had wanted to say  something--something private to them. Not that he had. Oh, far from it!  He lay there, purple, a dark, angry purple in the face, and never even  looked at them when they came in. Then, as they were standing there,  wondering what to do, he had suddenly opened one eye. Oh, what a  difference it would have made, what a difference to their memory of him,  how much easier to tell people about it, if he had only opened both! But  no--one eye only. It glared at them a moment and then... went out.      Chapter 3.IV.    It had made it very awkward for them when Mr. Farolles, of St. John's,  called the same afternoon.    \"The end was quite peaceful, I trust?\" were the first words he said as  he glided towards them through the dark drawing-room.    \"Quite,\" said Josephine faintly. They both hung their heads. Both of  them felt certain that eye wasn't at all a peaceful eye.    \"Won't you sit down?\" said Josephine.    \"Thank you, Miss Pinner,\" said Mr. Farolles gratefully. He folded his  coat-tails and began to lower himself into father's arm-chair, but  just as he touched it he almost sprang up and slid into the next chair  instead.    He coughed. Josephine clasped her hands; Constantia looked vague.    \"I want you to feel, Miss Pinner,\" said Mr. Farolles, \"and you, Miss  Constantia, that I'm trying to be helpful. I want to be helpful to you  both, if you will let me. These are the times,\" said Mr Farolles, very  simply and earnestly, \"when God means us to be helpful to one another.\"    \"Thank you very much, Mr. Farolles,\" said Josephine and Constantia.    \"Not at all,\" said Mr. Farolles gently. He drew his kid gloves through  his fingers and leaned forward. \"And if either of you would like a  little Communion, either or both of you, here and now, you have only  to tell me. A little Communion is often very help--a great comfort,\" he  added tenderly.    But the idea of a little Communion terrified them. What! In the  drawing-room by themselves--with no--no altar or anything! The piano  would be much too high, thought Constantia, and Mr. Farolles could not  possibly lean over it with the chalice. And Kate would be sure to come  bursting in and interrupt them, thought Josephine. And supposing the  bell rang in the middle? It might be somebody important--about their  mourning. Would they get up reverently and go out, or would they have to  wait... in torture?    \"Perhaps you will send round a note by your good Kate if you would care  for it later,\" said Mr. Farolles.    \"Oh yes, thank you very much!\" they both said.    Mr. Farolles got up and took his black straw hat from the round table.    \"And about the funeral,\" he said softly. \"I may arrange that--as your  dear father's old friend and yours, Miss Pinner--and Miss Constantia?\"    Josephine and Constantia got up too.    \"I should like it to be quite simple,\" said Josephine firmly, \"and not  too expensive. At the same time, I should like--\"    \"A good one that will last,\" thought dreamy Constantia, as if Josephine  were buying a nightgown. But, of course, Josephine didn't say that. \"One  suitable to our father's position.\" She was very nervous.    \"I'll run round to our good friend Mr. Knight,\" said Mr. Farolles  soothingly. \"I will ask him to come and see you. I am sure you will find  him very helpful indeed.\"      Chapter 3.V.    Well, at any rate, all that part of it was over, though neither of them  could possibly believe that father was never coming back. Josephine had  had a moment of absolute terror at the cemetery, while the coffin was  lowered, to think that she and Constantia had done this thing without  asking his permission. What would father say when he found out? For he  was bound to find out sooner or later. He always did. \"Buried. You two  girls had me buried!\" She heard his stick thumping. Oh, what would  they say? What possible excuse could they make? It sounded such an  appallingly heartless thing to do. Such a wicked advantage to take of  a person because he happened to be helpless at the moment. The  other people seemed to treat it all as a matter of course. They were  strangers; they couldn't be expected to understand that father was the  very last person for such a thing to happen to. No, the entire blame for  it all would fall on her and Constantia. And the expense, she thought,  stepping into the tight-buttoned cab. When she had to show him the  bills. What would he say then?    She heard him absolutely roaring. \"And do you expect me to pay for this  gimcrack excursion of yours?\"    \"Oh,\" groaned poor Josephine aloud, \"we shouldn't have done it, Con!\"    And Constantia, pale as a lemon in all that blackness, said in a  frightened whisper, \"Done what, Jug?\"    \"Let them bu-bury father like that,\" said Josephine, breaking down and  crying into her new, queer-smelling mourning handkerchief.    \"But what else could we have done?\" asked Constantia wonderingly. \"We  couldn't have kept him, Jug--we couldn't have kept him unburied. At any  rate, not in a flat that size.\"    Josephine blew her nose; the cab was dreadfully stuffy.    \"I don't know,\" she said forlornly. \"It is all so dreadful. I feel we  ought to have tried to, just for a time at least. To make perfectly  sure. One thing's certain\"--and her tears sprang out again--\"father will  never forgive us for this--never!\"      Chapter 3.VI.    Father would never forgive them.

But above all, for the condiments which were  almost necessary for health, and certainly desirable for seasoning  the salted food of winter and the salted fish of Lent. Europeans  were dependent upon the spices of the Asiatic islands. In Hakluyt's  great work on \"English Voyages and Navigations,\" he gives in his  second volume a list, written out by an Aleppo merchant, William  Barrett, in 1584, of the places whence the chief staples of the  Eastern trade came, and it will be interesting to give a selection  from his long account.      Cloves from Maluco, Tarenate, Amboyna, by way of Java.    Nutmegs from Banda.    Maces from Banda, Java, and Malacca.    Pepper Common from Malabar.    Sinnamon from Seilan (Ceylon).    Spicknard from Zindi (Scinde) and Lahor.    Ginger Sorattin from Sorat (Surat) within Cambaia (Bay of Bengal).    Corall of Levant from Malabar.    Sal Ammoniacke from Zindi and Cambaia.    Camphora from Brimeo (Borneo) near to China.    Myrrha from Arabia Felix.    Borazo (Borax) from Cambaia and Lahor.    Ruvia to die withall, from Chalangi.    Allumme di Rocca (Rock Alum) from China and Constantinople.    Oppopanax from Persia.    Lignum Aloes from Cochin, China, and Malacca.    Laccha (Shell-lac) from Pegu and Balaguate.    Agaricum from Alemannia.    Bdellium from Arabia Felix.    Tamarinda from Balsara (Bassorah).    Safran (Saffron) from Balsara and Persia.    Thus from Secutra (Socotra).    Nux Vomica from Malabar.    Sanguis Draconis (Dragon's Blood) from Secutra.    Musk from Tartarie by way of China.    Indico (Indigo) from Zindi and Cambaia.    Silkes Fine from China.    Castorium (Castor Oil) from Almania.    Masticke from Sio.    Oppium from Pugia (Pegu) and Cambaia.    Dates from Arabia Felix and Alexandria.    Sena from Mecca.    Gumme Arabicke from Zaffo (Jaffa).    Ladanum (Laudanum) from Cyprus and Candia.    Lapis Lazzudis from Persia.    Auripigmentum (Gold Paint) from many places of Turkey.    Rubarbe from Persia and China.    These are only a few selections from Barrett's list, but will  sufficiently indicate what a large number of household luxuries,  and even necessities, were derived from Asia in the Middle Ages.  The Arabs had practically the monopoly of this trade, and as Europe  had scarcely anything to offer in exchange except its gold and  silver coins, there was a continuous drain of the precious metals  from West to East, rendering the Sultans and Caliphs continuously  richer, and culminating in the splendours of Solomon the Magnificent.  Alexandria was practically the centre of all this trade, and most  of the nations of Europe found it necessary to establish factories  in that city, to safeguard the interests of their merchants, who  all sought for Eastern luxuries in its port Benjamin of Tudela,  a Jew, who visited it about 1172, gives the following description  of it:--    \"The city is very mercantile, and affords an excellent market to  all nations. People from all Christian kingdoms resort to Alexandria,  from Valencia, Tuscany, Lombardy, Apulia, Amalfi, Sicilia, Raguvia,  Catalonia, Spain, Roussillon, Germany, Saxony, Denmark, England,  Flandres, Hainault, Normandy, France, Poitou, Anjou, Burgundy,  Mediana, Provence, Genoa, Pisa, Gascony, Arragon, and Navarre.  From the West you meet Mohammedans from Andalusia, Algarve, Africa,  and Arabia, as well as from the countries towards India, Savila,  Abyssinia, Nubia, Yemen, Mesopotamia, and Syria, besides Greeks  and Turks. From India they import all sorts of spices, which are  bought by Christian merchants. The city is full of bustle, and  every nation has its own fonteccho (or hostelry) there.\"    Of all these nations, the Italians had the shortest voyage to make  before reaching Alexandria, and the Eastern trade practically fell  into their hands before the end of the thirteenth century. At first  Amalfi and Pisa were the chief ports, and, as we have seen, it  was at Amalfi that the mariner's compass was perfected; but soon  the two maritime towns at the heads of the two seas surrounding  Italy came to the front, owing to the advantages of their natural  position. Genoa and Venice for a long time competed with one another  for the monopoly of this trade, but the voyage from Venice was  more direct, and after a time Genoa had to content itself with  the trade with Constantinople and the northern overland route from  China. From Venice the spices, the jewels, the perfumes, and stuffs  of the East were transmitted north through Augsburg and Nuernberg  to Antwerp and Bruges and the Hanse Towns, receiving from them  the gold they had gained by their fisheries and textile goods.  England sent her wool to Italy, in order to tickle her palate and  her nose with the condiments and perfumes of the East.    The wealth and importance of Venice were due almost entirely to  this monopoly of the lucrative Eastern trade. By the fifteenth  century she had extended her dominions all along the lower valley  of the Po, into Dalmatia, parts of the Morea, and in Crete, till  at last, in 1489, she obtained possession of Cyprus, and thus had  stations all the way from Aleppo or Alexandria to the north of the  Adriatic. But just as she seemed to have reached the height of her  prosperity--when the Aldi were the chief printers in Europe, and  the Bellini were starting the great Venetian school of painting--a  formidable rival came to the front, who had been slowly preparing  a novel method of competition in the Eastern trade for nearly the  whole of the fifteenth century. With that method begins the great  epoch of modern geographical discovery.    [_Authorities:_ Heyd, _Commerce du Levant_, 2 vols., 1878.]          CHAPTER VI    TO THE INDIES EASTWARD--PRINCE HENRY AND VASCO DA GAMA    Up to the fifteenth century the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula  were chiefly occupied in slowly moving back the tide of Mohammedan  conquest, which had spread nearly throughout the country from 711  onwards. The last sigh of the Moor in Spain was to be uttered in  1492--an epoch-making year, both in history and in geography. But  Portugal, the western side of the peninsula, had got rid of her  Moors at a much earlier date--more that 200 years before--though  she found it difficult to preserve her independence from the  neighbouring kingdom of Castile. The attempt of King Juan of Castile  to conquer the country was repelled by Joao, a natural son of the  preceding king of Portugal, and in 1385 he became king, and freed  Portugal from any danger on the side of Castile by his victory  at Aljubarrota. He married Philippa, daughter of John of Gaunt;  and his third son, Henry, was destined to be the means of  revolutionising men's views of the inhabited globe. He first showed  his mettle in the capture of Ceuta, opposite Gibraltar, at the  time of the battle of Agincourt, 1415, and by this means he first  planted the Portuguese banner on the Moorish coast. This contact  with the Moors may possibly have first suggested to Prince Henry  the idea of planting similar factory-fortresses among the Mussulmans  of India; but, whatever the cause, he began, from about the year  1418, to devote all his thoughts and attention to the possibility  of reaching India otherwise than through the known routes, and  for that purpose established himself on the rocky promontory of  Sagres, almost the most western spot on the continent of Europe.    Here he established an observatory, and a seminary for the training of  theoretical and practical navigators. He summoned thither astronomers  and cartographers and skilled seamen, while he caused stouter and  larger vessels to be built for the express purpose of exploration.  He perfected the astrolabe (the clumsy predecessor of the modern  sextant) by which the latitude could be with some accuracy determined;  and he equipped all his ships with the compass, by which their  steering was entirely determined. He brought from Majorca (which,  as we have seen, was the centre of practical map-making in the  fourteenth century) one Mestre Jacme, \"a man very skilful in the  art of navigation, and in the making of maps and instruments.\"  With his aid, and doubtless that of others, he set himself to study  the problem of the possibility of a sea voyage to India round the  coast of Africa.    [Illustration: PROGRESS OF PORTUGUESE DISCOVERY]    We have seen that Ptolemy, with true scientific caution, had left  undefined the extent of Africa to the south; but Eratosthenes and  many of the Roman geographers, even after Ptolemy, were not content  with this agnosticism, but boldly assumed that the coast of Africa  made a semicircular sweep from the right horn of Africa, just south  of the Red Sea, with which they were acquainted, round to the  north-western shore, near what we now term Morocco. If this were  the fact, the voyage by the ocean along this sweep of shore would  be even shorter than the voyage through the Mediterranean and Red  Seas, while of course there would be no need for disembarking at  the Isthmus of Suez. The writers who thus curtailed Africa of its  true proportions assumed another continent south of it, which,  however, was in the torrid zone, and completely uninhabitable.    Now the north-west coast of Africa was known in Prince Henry's  days as far as Cape Bojador. It would appear that Norman sailors  had already advanced beyond Cape Non, or Nun, which was so called  because it was supposed that nothing existed beyond it. Consequently  the problems that Prince Henry had to solve were whether the coast of  Africa trended sharply to the east after Cape Bojador, and whether  the ideas of the ancients about the uninhabitability of the torrid  zone were justified by fact. He attempted to solve these problems by  sending out, year after year, expeditions down the north-west coast  of"]]]
