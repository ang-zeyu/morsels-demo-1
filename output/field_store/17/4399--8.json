To him they are just a  particular kind of choral song; it is doubtful if he even knew that they  were Spring Songs; but this he did know, though he throws out the  information carelessly--the Dithyramb had for its proper subject the  birth or coming to be, the _genesis_ of Dionysos.    The common usage of Greek poetry bears out Plato's statement. When a  poet is going to describe the birth of Dionysos he calls the god by the  title _Dithyrambos_. Thus an inscribed hymn found at Delphi[28] opens  thus:        \"Come, O Dithyrambos, Bacchos, come.      ...      Bromios, come, and coming with thee bring      Holy hours of thine own holy spring.      ...      All the stars danced for joy. Mirth      Of mortals hailed thee, Bacchos, at thy birth.\"    The Dithyramb is the song of the birth, and the birth of Dionysos is in  the spring, the time of the maypole, the time of the holy Bull.           *       *       *       *       *    And now we come to a curious thing. We have seen how a spirit, a daemon,  and perhaps ultimately a god, develops out of an actual rite. Dionysos  the Tree-God, the Spirit of Vegetation, is but a maypole once  _per_ceived, then remembered and _con_ceived. Dionysos, the Bull-God, is  but the actual holy Bull himself, or rather the succession of annual  holy Bulls once perceived, then remembered, generalized, conceived. But  the god conceived will surely always be made in the image, the mental  image, of the fact perceived. If, then, we have a song and dance of the  _birth_ of Dionysos, shall we not, as in the Christian religion, have a  child-god, a holy babe, a Saviour in the manger; at first in original  form as a calf, then as a human child? Now it is quite true that in  Greek religion there is a babe Dionysos called _Liknites_, \"Him of the  Cradle.\"[29] The rite of waking up, or bringing to light, the child  Liknites was performed each year at Delphi by the holy women.    But it is equally clear and certain that _the_ Dionysos of Greek worship  and of the drama was not a babe in the cradle. He was a goodly youth in  the first bloom of manhood, with the down upon his cheek, the time when,  Homer says, \"youth is most gracious.\" This is the Dionysos that we know  in statuary, the fair, dreamy youth sunk in reverie; this is the  Dionysos whom Pentheus despised and insulted because of his young beauty  like a woman's. But how could such a Dionysos arise out of a rite of  birth? He could not, and he did not. The Dithyramb is also the song of  the second or new birth, the Dithyrambos is the twice-born.    This the Greeks themselves knew. By a false etymology they explained the  word _Dithyrambos_ as meaning \"He of the double door,\" their word  _thyra_ being the same as our _door_. They were quite mistaken;  _Dithyrambos_, modern philology tells us, is the Divine Leaper, Dancer,  and Lifegiver. But their false etymology is important to us, because it  shows that they believed the Dithyrambos was the twice-born. Dionysos  was born, they fabled, once of his mother, like all men, once of his  father's thigh, like no man.    But if the Dithyrambos, the young Dionysos, like the Bull-God, the  Tree-God, arises from a _dromenon_, a rite, what is the rite of second  birth from which it arises?           *       *       *       *       *    We look in vain among our village customs. If ever rite of second birth  existed, it is dead and buried. We turn to anthropology for help, and  find this, the rite of the second birth, widespread, universal, over  half the savage world.    With the savage, to be twice born is the rule, not the exception. By his  first birth he comes into the world, by his second he is born into his  tribe. At his first birth he belongs to his mother and the women-folk;  at his second he becomes a full-fledged man and passes into the society  of the warriors of his tribe. This second birth is a little difficult  for us to realize. A boy with us passes very gradually from childhood to  manhood, there is no definite moment when he suddenly emerges as a man.  Little by little as his education advances he is admitted to the social  privileges of the circle in which he is born. He goes to school, enters  a workshop or a university, and finally adopts a trade or a profession.  In the case of girls, in whose upbringing primitive savagery is apt to  linger, there is still, in certain social strata a ceremony known as  Coming Out. A girl's dress is suddenly lengthened, her hair is put up,  she is allowed to wear jewels, she kisses her sovereign's hand, a dance  is given in her honour; abruptly, from her seclusion in the cocoon state  of the schoolroom, she emerges full-blown into society. But the custom,  with its half-realized savagery, is already dying, and with boys it does  not obtain at all. Both sexes share, of course, the religious rite of  Confirmation.    To avoid harsh distinctions, to bridge over abrupt transitions, is  always a mark of advancing civilization; but the savage, in his  ignorance and fear, lamentably over-stresses distinctions and  transitions. The long process of education, of passing from child to  man, is with him condensed into a few days, weeks, or sometimes months  of tremendous educational emphasis--of what is called \"initiation,\"  \"going in,\" that is, entering the tribe. The ceremonies vary, but the  gist is always substantially the same. The boy is to put away childish  things, and become a grown and competent tribesman. Above all he is to  cease to be a woman-thing and become a man. His initiation prepares him  for his two chief functions as a tribesman--to be a warrior, to be a  father. That to the savage is the main if not the whole Duty of Man.    This \"initiation\" is of tremendous importance, and we should expect,  what in fact we find, that all this emotion that centres about it issues  in _dromena_, \"rites done.\" These rites are very various, but they all  point one moral, that the former things are passed away and that the  new-born man has entered on a new life.    Simplest perhaps of all, and most instructive, is the rite practised by  the Kikuyu of British East Africa,[30] who require that every boy, just  before circumcision, must be born again. \"The mother stands up with the  boy crouching at her feet; she pretends to go through all the labour  pains, and the boy on being reborn cries like a babe and is washed.\"    More often the new birth is simulated, or imagined, as a death and a  resurrection, either of the boys themselves or of some one else in their  presence. Thus at initiation among some tribes of South-east  Australia,[31] when the boys are assembled an old man dressed in stringy  bark fibre lies down in a grave. He is covered up lightly with sticks  and earth, and the grave is smoothed over. The buried man holds in his  hand a small bush which seems to be growing from the ground, and other  bushes are stuck in the ground round about. The novices are then brought  to the edge of the grave and a song is sung. Gradually, as the song goes  on, the bush held by the buried man begins to quiver. It moves more and  more and bit by bit the man himself starts up from the grave.    The Fijians have a drastic and repulsive way of simulating death. The  boys are shown a row of seemingly dead men, their bodies covered with  blood and entrails, which are really those of a dead pig. The first  gives a sudden yell. Up start the men, and then run to the river to  cleanse themselves.    Here the death is vicarious. Another goes through the simulated death  that the initiated boy may have new life. But often the mimicry is  practised on the boys themselves. Thus in West Ceram[32] boys at puberty  are admitted to the Kakian association. The boys are taken blindfold,  followed by their relations, to an oblong wooden shed under the darkest  trees in the depths of the forest. When all are assembled the high  priest calls aloud on the devils, and immediately a hideous uproar is  heard from the shed. It is really made by men in the shed with bamboo  trumpets, but the women and children think it is the devils. Then the  priest enters the shed with the boys, one at a time. A dull thud of  chopping is heard, a fearful cry rings out, and a sword dripping with  blood is thrust out through the roof. This is the token that the boy's  head has been cut off, and that the devil has taken him away to the  other world, whence he will return born again. In a day or two the men  who act as sponsors to the boys return daubed with mud, and in a  half-fainting state like messengers from another world. They bring the  good news that the devil has restored the boys to life. The boys  themselves appear, but when they return they totter as they walk; they  go into the house backwards. If food is given them they upset the plate.  They sit dumb and only make signs. The sponsors have to teach them the  simplest daily acts as though they were new-born children. At the end of  twenty to thirty days, during which their mothers and sisters may not  comb their hair, the high priest takes them to a lonely place in the  forest and cuts off a lock of hair from the crown of each of their  heads. At the close of these rites the boys are men and may marry.    Sometimes the new birth is not simulated but merely suggested. A new  name is given, a new language taught, a new dress worn, new dances are  danced. Almost always it is accompanied by moral teaching. Thus in the  Kakian ceremony already described the boys have to sit in a row  cross-legged, without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#12)"],[1,"bad treatment which they had  experienced during the previous year had discouraged them from coming to  trade, and that his long absence from the country had left the whole  tribe under the impression that he did not intend to return. On hearing  this, Champlain recognized that it would be advisable to visit the  Algonquins at once, in order to continue his discoveries, and to  preserve friendly relations with them.    During his residence in France, Champlain had met a young Frenchman  named Nicholas du Vignau, who claimed to have seen the Northern Sea,  and said that the Algonquin River flowed from a lake which emptied into  it. He also stated that the journey from Sault St. Louis to this sea and  return could be accomplished in seventeen days, and that he had seen  there the wreck and debris of an English ship, on board of which were  eighty men. This intelligence seemed the more probable as the English  were supposed to have visited the Labrador coast in 1612, where they had  discovered a strait.    Champlain requested a merchant of La Rochelle, named Georges, to give du  Vignau a passage on his ship, which he did willingly, and he also made  an affidavit before a notary concerning du Vignau's Relation. Du Vignau  came to Canada, and accompanied Champlain on his visit to the  Algonquins. The party, consisting of four Frenchmen and one savage, set  out from Ste. Helen's Island on May 27th, 1613.    After having passed the falls they entered Lake St. Louis. On the last  day of May they passed Lake des Deux Montagnes, which Champlain called  Lake de Soissons. Some days after they came in sight of the river  Gatineau, the river Rideau and its fall, and the Chaudiere Falls, where  they were forced to land. They also passed the rapid des Chats, Lake des  Chats, Madawaska River, Muskrat Lake, and Allumette Island, where an  Algonquin chief named Tessoueat resided. On the following day the Indians  gave a _tabagie_ in honour of Champlain, who after smoking the pipe of  peace with the party, explained to them that the object of his visit was  to assure them of his friendship, and to assist them in their wars, as  he had done before.[15]    He told them also that he was making an excursion into their country to  observe the fertility of the soil, and study their lakes and rivers, and  to discover the sea which he was told was in their vicinity. Champlain  therefore requested them to furnish four canoes, and eight Indians as  guides, to conduct the party to the Nipissirini, in order to induce  their enemies to fight.    The chief Tessoueat, speaking in behalf of the whole tribe, said that he  regarded Champlain as the most friendly of all the French, for the  others were unwilling to help them in their wars, but that they had  resolved not to go to the falls again, and that, owing to the long  absence of Champlain from the country, they had been compelled to go to  the wars alone. They therefore begged him to postpone his expedition  until the following year.    They granted Champlain's request of four canoes with great reluctance,  and stated that the Nipissirini were sorcerers, and not their friends.  Champlain insisted on having the guides, and stated that he had brought  with him a young man who would find no difficulty in visiting the  country of the Nipissirini.    Tessoueat thereupon addressed the young man by name, and said: \"Nicholas,  is it true that you were among the Nebicerini?\" \"Yes,\" said he in  Algonquin language, \"I was there.\" \"You are a downright liar,\" replied  Tessoueat, \"you know well that you slept at my side every night, with my  children, where you arose every morning; if you were among the people  mentioned, it was while sleeping. How could you have been as bold as to  lead your chief to believe lies, and so wicked as to be willing to  expose his life to so many dangers? You are a worthless fellow and ought  to be put to death, more cruelly than we do our enemies.\"    Shortly after, Champlain advised the Indians that the young lad had  confessed that he had lied concerning his visits to the Nipissirini  country. By telling them the facts Champlain hoped to ensure the life of  Nicholas du Vignau, as the savages had said, \"Give him to us, and we  promise that he shall not lie any more.\"    On June 10th Champlain took leave of Tessoueat, after making him presents  and promising to return during the next year to assist in the war.  Continuing his course, Champlain again approached the Chaudiere Falls,  where the savages went through a ceremony peculiar to them, which is  thus described:    \"After carrying their canoes to the foot of the falls, they assembled  in one spot, where one of them took up a collection in a wooden plate,  into which each one placed a piece of tobacco. The collection having  been made, the plate was placed in the middle of the troupe, as they all  danced around it, singing after their style. Then one of them made a  harangue, setting forth that for a long time they had been accustomed to  make this offering, by means of which they were insured protection  against their enemies, and that otherwise misfortune would befall them,  as they were convinced by the evil spirit; and that they lived on in  this superstition, as in many others. This done, the maker of the  harangue took the plate, and threw the tobacco into the midst of the  caldron, whereupon they all raised a loud cry.\"    Such was the superstition of these savages that they considered a  favourable journey impossible without this uncouth ceremony. It was at  this portage that their enemies had been wont to surprise them.    On June 17th they arrived at Sault St. Louis on their return journey.  Captain L'Ange, who was the confidant of Champlain, brought news that  Maisonneuve of St. Malo had arrived with a passport from the Prince de  Conde for three vessels. Champlain therefore allowed him to trade with  the savages.    As the trade with the savages was now completed, Champlain resolved to  return to France by the first vessel which was ready to start. He  accepted a passage in Maisonneuve's vessel, which arrived at St. Malo on  August 26th. Champlain had an interview with the merchants, to whom he  represented that a good association could be formed in the future. The  merchants resolved to follow the example of those of Rouen and La  Rochelle.    In concluding this chapter we may repeat the words of Champlain: \"May  God by His grace cause this undertaking to prosper to His honour and  glory the conversion of these poor benighted ones, and to the honour and  welfare of France.\"[16]    FOOTNOTES:    [13] Jean Godet, Sieur du Parc, was a brother of Claude des Marets. He  came with his brother to Quebec in 1609, and wintered there. In 1616 he  commanded at Quebec. On his return to France, he remained at St. Germain  de Clairefeuille, where he died on November 16th, 1652.    [14] This volume is entitled: _Les Voyages du Sieur de Champlain  Xaintongeois, capitaine pour le Roy, en la marine...._ A Paris, MDCXIII.  This volume contains a letter to the king, another one to the queen,  stanzas addressed to the French, an ode to Champlain on his book and his  marine maps, signed by Motin. The first book contains the voyages of  Champlain along the coasts of Acadia and New England. The second relates  to the voyages of Champlain to Quebec, in the years 1608, 1610 and 1611.  This edition is the most useful and the most interesting of all. Two  large maps of New France give an excellent idea of the country, though  they are not absolutely accurate.    [15] In August, 1867, a farmer called Overman, found on his land, lot  12, township of Ross, county of Renfrew, Ontario, an astrolabe supposed  to have been lost by Champlain during this expedition. From June 6th,  1613, Champlain seems to have ceased his observations, as he does not  say after this date: \"I have taken the latitude.\" This fact would seem  to prove that the instrument was not used after June 6th, 1613. Some  pamphlets have been written on the astrolabe, and they all agree that it  had belonged to Champlain. Mr. Russell, one of the writers, has given a  full description of it.    [16] _Quatrieme voyage du Sr. de Champlain, capitaine ordinaire pour le  Roy en la Marine, et Lieutenant de Monseigneur le Prince de Conde en la  Nouvelle France, fait en l'annee 1613._ This Relation contains a letter  to Henri de Conde, and a geographical map, made in 1612, of a large size  and very curious. The history of this voyage is really a part of the  so-called edition of 1613, and the printing of it was done at the same  time as the Relations of the first, second and third voyages, which form  altogether a large volume of three hundred and twenty-five pages.          CHAPTER V    THE RECOLLETS AND THEIR MISSIONS      Champlain's affection for New France, the land of his adoption, made him  anxious to continue his explorations, in order that he might become  familiar with every locality. In the course of his voyages he often had  to be conveyed in Indian canoes, especially on the lakes and rivers, but  this means was sufficient only when his object was to ascertain whether  the country was well watered, whether the rivers were more or less  navigable, whether the lakes abounded with fish, and whether the water  powers were capable of being turned to account. Up till this time the  founder of Quebec had pressed forward his work of exploration with an  energy that was almost astonishing. He had rowed up the Iroquois River  as far as lake Champlain, and he had also navigated the Ottawa River in  a manner that had even surprised the Algonquins. Still many things  remained to be done and to be seen, such as to observe the fertility of  the soil in different latitudes, to study the manners and customs of the  Indians, especially of the great Huron tribe, which was the most  populous and probably better disposed to receive Christian instruction  than the other tribes.
