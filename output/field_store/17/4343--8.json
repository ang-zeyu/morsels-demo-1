But as you spin toward Wayne Junction you see acres and  acres of trim little houses, each with a bright patch of turf. Here  is a woman in a blue dress and white cap, busily belabouring a rug  on the grass. The bank of the cutting by Wayne Junction is thick  with a tangle of rosebushes which will presently be in blossom; we  know them well. Spring Garden Street: if you know where to look you  can catch a blink of Edgar Allan Poe's little house. Through a  jumble of queer old brick chimneys and dormers, and here we are at  the Reading Terminal, with its familiar bitter smell of coal gas.    Of course we stop to have a look at the engine, one of those  splendid Reading locos with the three great driving wheels. Splendid  things, the big Reading locos; when they halt they pant so  cheerfully and noisily, like huge dogs, much louder than any other  engines. We always expect to see an enormous red tongue running in  and out over the cowcatcher. Vast thick pants, as the poet said in  \"Khubla Khan.\" We can't remember if he wore them, or breathed them,  but there it is in the poem; look it up. Reading engineers, too,  always give us a sense of security. They have gray hair, cropped  very close. They have a benign look, rather like Walt Whitman if he  were shaved. We wrote a poem about one of them once, Tom Hartzell,  who used to take the 5:12 express out of Jersey City.    Philadelphia, incidentally, is the only large city where the Dime  Museum business still flourishes. For the first thing we see on  leaving the Terminal is that the old Bingham Hotel is now The  World's Museum, given over to Ursa the Bear Girl and similar  excitements. But where is the beautiful girl with slick dark hair  who used to be at the Reading terminal news-stand?    How much more we could tell you about travelling on the Reading! We  would like to tell you about the queer assortment of books we  brought back with us. (There were twelve men in the smoker, coming  home.) We could tell how we tried to buy, without being observed, a  magazine which we will call _Foamy Fiction_, in order to see what  the new editor (a friend of ours) is printing. Also, we always buy a  volume of Gissing when we go to Philly, and this time we found \"In  the Year of Jubilee\" in the shop of Jerry Cullen, the delightful  bookseller who used to be so redheaded, but is getting over it now  in the most logical way. We could tell you about the lovely old  whitewashed stone farmhouses (with barns painted red on behalf of  Schenk's Mandrake Pills) and about the famous curve near Roelofs, so  called because the soup rolls off the table in the dining car when  they take the curve at full speed; and about Bound Brook, which has  a prodigious dump of tin cans that catches the setting sunlight----    It makes us sad to think that a hundred years hence people will be  travelling along that road and never know how much we loved it. They  will be doing so to-morrow, too; but it seems more mournful to think  about the people a hundred years hence.    When we got back to Jersey City, and stood on the front end of the  ferryboat, Manhattan was piling up all her jewels into the cold  green dusk. There were a few stars, just about as many as there are  passengers in a Reading smoker. There was one big star directly over  Brooklyn, and another that seemed to be just above Plainfield. We  pondered, as the ferry slid toward its hutch at Liberty Street, that  there were no stars above Manhattan. Just at that moment--five  minutes after seven--the pinnacle of the Woolworth blossomed a ruby  red. New York makes her own.      III    You never know when an adventure is going to begin. But on a train  is a good place to lie in wait for them. So we sat down in the  smoker of the 10 A.M. Eastern Standard Time P.R.R. express to  Philadelphia, in a receptive mood.    At Manhattan Transfer the brakeman went through the train, crying in  a loud, clear, emphatic barytone: \"Next stop for this train is North  Philadelphia!\"    We sat comfortably, and in that mood of secretly exhilarated mental  activity which is induced by riding on a fast train. We were looking  over the June _Atlantic_. We smiled gently to ourself at that  unconscious breath of New England hauteur expressed in the  publisher's announcement, \"_The edition of the Atlantic is carefully  restricted._\" Then, meditating also on the admirable sense and skill  with which the magazine is edited, and getting deep into William  Archer's magnificent article \"The Great Stupidity\" (which we hope  all our clients will read) we became aware of outcries of anguish  and suffering in the aisle near by.    At Manhattan Transfer a stout little man with a fine domy forehead  and a derby hat tilted rather far aft had entered the smoker. He  suddenly learned that the train did not stop at Newark. He uttered  lamentation, and attacked the brakeman with grievous protest. \"I  heard you say, This train stops at Newark and Philadelphia,\" he  insisted. His cigar revolved wildly in the corner of his mouth;  crystal beads burst out upon the opulent curve of his forehead.  \"I've got to meet a man in Newark and sell him a bill of goods.\"    The brakeman was gentle but firm. \"Here's the conductor,\" he said.  \"You'll have to talk to him.\"    Now this is a tribute of admiration and respect to that conductor.  He came along the aisle punching tickets, holding his record slip  gracefully folded round the middle finger of his punch hand, as  conductors do. Like all experienced conductors he was alert,  watchful, ready for any kind of human guile and stupidity, but  courteous the while. The man bound for Newark ran to him and began  his harangue. The frustrated merchant was angry and felt himself a  man with a grievance. His voice rose in shrill tones, he waved his  hands.    Then began a scene that was delightful to watch. The conductor was  magnificently tactful. He ought to have been an ambassador (in fact,  he reminded us of one ambassador, for his trim and slender figure,  his tawny, drooping moustache, the gentle and serene tact of his  bearing, were very like Mr. Henry van Dyke). He allowed the  protestant to exhaust himself with reproaches, and then he began an  affectionate little sermon, tender, sympathetic, but firm.    \"I thought this train stopped at Newark,\" the fat man kept on  saying.    \"You mustn't think, you must _know_,\" said the conductor, gazing  shrewdly at him above the rims of his demi-lune spectacles. \"Now,  why did you get on a train without making sure where it stopped? You  heard the brakeman say: 'Newark and Philadelphia'? No; he said  'North Philadelphia.' Yes, I know you were in a hurry, but that  wasn't our fault, was it? Now, let me tell you something: I've been  working for this company for twenty-five years....\"    Unhappily the noise of the train prevented us from hearing the  remark that followed. We were remembering a Chinese translation that  we made once. It went something like this:                 A SUSPICIOUS NATURE             _Whenever I travel            I ask at least three train-men            If this is the right train            For where I am going,            Even then            I hardly believe them._    But as we watched the two, the conductor gently convincing the  irate passenger that he would have to abide by his mistake, and the  truculent fat man gradually realizing that he was hopelessly in the  wrong, a new aspect subtly came over the dialogue. We saw the stout  man wither and droop. We thought he was going to die. His hat slid  farther and farther upward on his dewy brow. His hands fluttered.  His cigar, grievously chewed, trembled in its corner of his mouth.  His fine dark eyes filled with tears.    The conductor, you see, was explaining that he would have to pay the  fare to North Philadelphia and then take the first train back from  there to Newark.    We feared, for a few minutes, that it really would be a case for a  chirurgeon, with cupping and leeching and smelling salts. Our rotund  friend was in a bad way. His heart, plainly, was broken. From his  right-hand trouser emerged a green roll. With delicate speed and  tact the conductor hastened this tragic part of the performance. His  silver punch flashed in his hand as he made change, issued a cash  slip, and noted the name and address of the victim, for some  possible future restitution, we surmised, or perhaps only as a  generous anaesthetic.    The stout man sat down a few seats in front of us and we studied his  back. We have never seen a more convincing display of chagrin. With  a sombre introspective stare he gazed glassily before him. We never  saw any one show less enthusiasm for the scenery. The train flashed  busily along through the level green meadows, which blended exactly  with the green plush of the seats, but our friend was lost in a  gruesome trance. Even his cigar (long since gone out) was still,  save for an occasional quiver.    The conductor came to our seat, looking, good man, faintly stern and  sad, like a good parent who has had, regretfully, to chastise an  erring urchin.    \"Well,\" we said, \"the next time that chap gets on a train he'll take  care to find out where it stops.\"    The conductor smiled, but a humane, understanding smile. \"I try to  be fair with 'em,\" he said.    \"I think you were a wonder,\" we said.    By the time we reached North Philadelphia the soothing hand of Time  had exerted some of its consolation. The stout man wore a faintly  sheepish smile as he rose to escape. The brakeman was in the  vestibule. He, younger than the conductor, was no less kind, but we  would hazard that he is not quite as resigned to mortal error and  distress. He spoke genially, but there was a note of honest rebuke  in his farewell.    \"The next time you get on a train,\" he said, \"watch your stop.\"            [Illustration]        OUR TRICOLOUR TIE     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15795"],[0,"The Rover Boys in Camp; or, The Rivals of Pine Island (#12)"],[1,"alone,\" answered Tom.    \"Oh, Rover, please make him stop,\" pleaded Harry. \"He's trying to kill  me!\"    \"No, I ain't,\" retorted Flapp. \"I'm only giving him a whipping that he  deserves.\"    \"It's an outrage to strike anybody with that chain,\" said Sam.    \"You needn't put your oar in, Sam Rover!\"    \"But he just will, and so will I,\" said Tom. \"Give me that chain,\" and  he tried to pull it from Lew Flapp's hand.    \"Let go!\" screamed Lew Flapp, and began a struggle to keep the chain in  his possession. He struck at Tom, hitting him in the shoulder. Then Tom  got mad, doubled up his fist, and Lew Flapp received a blow in the left  eye that made him see stars.    \"Oh!\" he howled and dropped the chain. \"Tom Rover, I'll get even for  that, mind that!\"    \"What do you mean by attacking Harry Moss in such a disgraceful  fashion?\"    \"Because he's a sneak, and you know it.\"    \"I know nothing of the kind.\"    \"Didn't he go and blab on me to Captain Putnam?\"    \"About what?\"    Lew Flapp paused and eyed Tom and Sam curiously.    \"I reckon you know well enough,\" he remarked slowly.    \"But I don't know anything. Do you, Sam?\"    \"Not a thing. So far as I know Harry is all right.\"    \"Is he?\" sneered Flapp. \"Well, I don't think so.\"    \"What was the trouble about, Harry?\" asked Tom, turning to the small  boy.    \"Don't you say a word!\" shouted Lew Flapp, in alarm. \"If Tom and Sam  Rover don't know already they needn't know at all, so there.\"    \"Evidently you don't want Harry to talk,\" said Sam suggestively.    \"He's a sneak, I tell you.\"    \"And you are a big, long-legged bully,\" retorted Tom. \"For two pins I'd  give you a good drubbing.\"    \"Humph! Do you think you can lick me?\" blustered Flapp, who felt  certain he could best Tom at fisticuffs.    \"I don't think so--I know it,\" said Tom coolly.    \"Don't you fight him, Tom,\" said Sam, in alarm. \"He only wants to get  you into trouble. He'd like nothing better than to see you lose your  position as lieutenant.\"    \"He's afraid,\" sneered Lew Flapp. \"All of you Rover boys are mere bags  of wind.\"    \"I don't think you found Dick a bag of wind, Flapp.\"    \"Yes, I did. Now you clear out and let Moss and me settle this affair  between us.\"    But this was not to be, for Harry Moss was already at the doorway of  the boathouse and now he retreated to a safe distance.    \"If you hit Tom Rover, or Sam, I'll call Mr. Strong?\" cried the little  cadet.    \"Don't you do it,\" said Tom. \"I am not afraid of Flapp.\"    \"But he's so big, Tom.\"    \"I don't care for that.\"    Tom had scarcely spoken when Lew Flapp, watching his opportunity,  leaped forward and planted a blow on his chin that sent him staggering  back into Sam's arms.    \"Now come on, if you dare!\" he cried.    \"All right!\" came from Tom, as he recovered. And like a flash he flew  at Lew Flapp, before Sam could do a thing to stop him. Blow after blow  was taken and given by each of the cadets, and Tom was hit in the  chest, on the shoulder, and in the left cheek. In return Flapp got one  in the right eye that almost closed up that optic and then came a blow  on the nose that made the blood spurt in all directions.    \"Good for you, Tom!\" cried Sam, dancing around, forgetful of what he  had just said about his brother getting into trouble. \"That's the time  you did it. Now give him another!\"    Again the two boys went at it and once more Tom was struck in the  shoulder. Then Lew Flapp aimed for Tom's face, but the latter ducked  and, recovering, hit the big boy a heavy blow in the chin that made his  teeth rattle and sent him staggering over the side of an upturned boat  and flat on his back.    \"Hurrah!\" cried Sam. \"That was almost a knockout, Tom. Now give him to  understand--\"    Sam broke off short, as a warning cry from Harry Moss reached his ears.  All eyes turned toward the doorway of the boathouse and a second later  George Strong, the head teacher, stepped into view.          CHAPTER XIV    GETTING READY FOR THE ENCAMPMENT      For fully ten seconds after the head teacher appeared nobody spoke. Lew  Flapp arose slowly to his feet, and bringing out his handkerchief  applied it to his bleeding nose.    \"What does this mean?\" demanded George Strong sternly.    \"He--he pitched into me,\" faltered Flapp.    \"That is hardly true,\" returned Tom hotly.    \"Both of you are well aware that it is against the rules of this school  to fight,\" went on the teacher.    \"I know that, Mr. Strong,\" answered Tom. \"But Flapp struck me first.\"    \"It isn't so!\" cried the big boy. \"I wasn't doing anything, when Rover  came along and started to quarrel.\"    \"My brother Sam and Harry Moss can prove that Flapp struck me first.\"    \"That is true,\" said Harry Moss, while Sam nodded.    \"What was the quarrel about?\"    \"I caught him here, beating Harry with this boat chain. I told him to  stop and then he pitched into me.\"    \"Is this true, Moss?\"    \"Ye--yes, sir, but--I--I--didn't want to say anything about it, sir.\"    \"Do you mean to say that Flapp attacked you with that chain?\"    Harry Moss was silent.    \"Answer me.\"    \"He did. But, Mr. Strong, I don't want to make any complaint. He and  some of the others think I'm a--a sneak already,\" and now Harry could  hardly keep back his tears.    \"I don't know why he attacked Harry,\" put in Tom. \"But I couldn't stand  it, and I took the chain away from him and told him to stop. Then he  struck me, and we pitched into each other--and I guess he got the worst  of it,\" added Tom, a bit triumphantly.    \"Hum! Flapp, you may go and bathe your nose, which I see is bleeding,  and then come to Captain Putnam's office. The others can come to the  office with me.\"    George Strong led the way, and Tom, Sam, and Harry Moss followed. The  teacher took along the boat chain and made Harry show where he had been  struck.    Captain Putnam looked very grave when the affair was explained to him.  He questioned Harry in private and learned that the attack was made by  Flapp because of what the young cadet had told about drinking and  smoking.    \"Rover, it was wrong to fight,\" said the captain to Tom. \"But under the  circumstances I am inclined to be lenient with you. You can retire,  and this evening during off time I want you to write one hundred times,  the proverb beginning, 'Blessed are the peace-makers.'\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Tom humbly. He was glad to escape thus easily, for he  knew that the captain was very strict concerning fighting.    A little later the others were sent off, leaving Lew Flapp alone with  Captain Putnam.    \"Flapp,\" said the owner of the school, with a hardness that made the  big boy's heart sink into his shoes. \"I hardly know what to say to you.  Your former conduct was mean enough, and this appears to be on a level  with it. With such a heavy boat chain you might have injured Moss very  seriously. Do you want me to give you another chance or not?\"    \"Wh--what do you mean, sir?\" asked Flapp, much frightened.    \"Do you want to remain at Putnam Hall, or shall I send you home in  disgrace?\"    \"I--I don't want to go home,\" said the big boy. His father was a rough  man and he knew that if his parent heard of this trouble he would make  him pay dearly for it.    \"I expect my pupils to be young gentlemen,\" went on Captain Putnam.  \"This is an academy for the better class of boys only. Bad boys do not  come here, but are sent to the reformatory. If I give you another  chance will you promise to do better in the future?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Very well then, I will give you one more chance. I believe you are  somewhat behind in your arithmetic. During the next four days you will  remain in during all off time and apply yourself to such examples as  your teacher gives you.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Now you can go, and remember, I want to hear of no further fighting,  and no further molesting of Harry Moss.\"    \"I'll remember, sir,\" answered Lew Flapp meekly, and then left the  office and ran up to his dormitory, to bathe his nose and put  witch-hazel on his hurts. Although outwardly humble he was in reality  burning with rage.    \"I'll have to be careful in the future,\" he told himself, with clenched  fists. \"But I'll get square--oh, I'll get square!\"    \"Hullo, hurt yourself?\" asked Pender, as he came in.    \"Yes, I fell over a boat down at the boathouse,\" answered the big boy.    \"Is that so? I heard something of a fight, and came up to see about  it.\"    \"Oh, I had a row with Harry Moss and Tom Rover, but it didn't amount to  much, Gus. But, say, I just wish I could square up with Dick Rover, and  Tom, too!\"    \"You said something like that before.\"    \"I'm going to watch my chances.\"    \"Perhaps something will turn up during the encampment.\"    \"Yes, I was thinking of that. A fellow has more of a chance in camp  than he does in school.\"    \"It would be a fine thing to get Dick Rover into trouble and make him  lose his position as captain,\" went on Gus Pender.    \"Yes, and make Tom Rover lose his position as lieutenant, too,\" added  Flapp.    The term at Putnam Hall was now drawing to a close and it was not long  before the semi-annual examinations began. All of the Rovers worked  hard over their papers, and with more or less success. Sam came out at  the top of his class, while Tom stood third in his grade, and Dick  third in a still higher class. The boys lost no time in sending the  news home, and received word back that not only their father, but also  Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, were much pleased with the result.    \"Now we'll feel as if we deserve an outing,\" said Tom, and Sam and Dick  agreed with him.    It was on the following morning that Captain Putnam made an  announcement that filled all of the cadets with interest.    \"You are all anxious, I know, to learn where the annual encampment is  to be held,\" said he, during general assembly. \"I am pleased to be able  to announce that I have arranged to hold it at Pine Island, a fine bit  of ground, located close to the south shore of"]]]
