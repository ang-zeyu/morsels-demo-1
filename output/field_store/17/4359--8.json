They are the chief,  pale, bend, bend sinister, fess, bar, chevron, cross, and cross  saltier. There are thirteen subordinate ordinaries. The form, size,  and place that the honourable and subordinate ordinaries occupy in an  achievement are all described in the Manual, and in this Dictionary  under their different names.    [Illustration: ORLE.]    ORLE. A subordinate ordinary composed of double lines going round the  shield at some distance from its edge; it is half the width of the  bordure.    OVER ALL. This expression describes a figure borne over another and  obscuring part of it.    [Illustration: Over all]    EX. Quarterly or and gules, over all a bend vair.    PALE. One of the honourable ordinaries formed by two perpendicular  lines drawn from the base to the chief. The pale occupies one third of  the shield.    [Illustration: Pale]    EX. Azure, a pale or    PALL. A scarf in the shape of the letter Y, forming part of the  vesture of a Roman Catholic prelate. It is introduced as the principal  bearing of the archbishops of Canterbury, Armagh, and Dublin.    [Illustration: Pall]    Ex. Azure, on a pall argent, four crosses fitchy sable, in chief a  cross pattee of the second.    [Illustration: PALLET]    PALLET. A diminutive of the pale.    PALY. A field divided by perpendicular lines into several equal parts  of metal and tincture interchangeably disposed.    [Illustration: Paly]    Ex. Paly of four, argent and gules.    PARTY or PARTED signifies divided, and applies to the several parts of  an escutcheon parted by a line, which always runs in the direction  of one or more of the honourable ordinaries, as may be seen in the  following examples:--    [Illustration: Parted per pale and par bend sinister]    PARTED PER PALE AND PER BEND SINISTER Counterchanged, or and gules.    [Illustration: Parted per pale and per chevron]    PARTED PER PALE AND PER CHEVRON. Gules and or, counter changed.    PARTY PER FESS. A shield parted in the centre by an horizontal line  through the fess point.    [Illustration: Party per fess]    Ex. Party per fess, engrailed, argent and gules.    PARTY PER PALE. This signifies a shield parted by a perpendicular line  down the centre, so that one shield may contain two coats of arms.    [Illustration: Party per pale]    Ex. Parted per pale, gules and argent.    PASCHAL LAMB, or HOLY LAMB.    [Illustration: Paschal lamb]    Ex. Argent, a lamb passant, carrying a banner charged with a cross.    PASSANT. Passing or walking. See LION PASSANT and PASSANT GUARDANT.    PATONCE. See CROSS.    PATTE. A cross small in the centre, wide at the ends. See CROSS.    PATRIARCHAL CROSS. Cross used by patriarchs in the Greek church. See  CROSS.    PEARL. A precious stone, used by ancient heralds for argent in  emblazoning the arms of peers.    PEAN. The name of a fur, the field sable, the tufts or.    PEER. Name given to all persons included in the rank of nobility.    PELLETS. A name given to black roundlets.    PENDANT. A shield suspended or hanging from a branch of a tree,  or from a nail. Shields of arms frequently appear drawn thus in  architecture, and when described are said to be pendant.    [Illustration: Pennons]    PENNONS. Small flags borne at the end of a lance of an esquire or  gentleman bearing his paternal arms. The end of the pennon was cut  off upon the person being created a knight banneret. See BANNERET.  Penoncels or Pencils were small flags decorating the helmet or the  horse armour. They are now only used at funerals. The large flag in  the engraving is a pennon, the smaller, penoncels or pencils.    PHEON. A missile instrument with a barbed head, thrown from a cross  bow.    [Illustration: Pheon]    Ex. Argent, a pheon proper.    PIERCED OR PERFORATED. Cut through the centre.    [Illustration: Pierced]    Ex. Argent, a mullet pierced, sable, on a chief azure, three mullets  pierced, of the first.    PILE. An angular figure like a wedge, formed by lines running from the  dexter and sinister chief to the middle base.    [Illustration: Pile]    Ex. Argent, a pile, purpure.    IN PILE. Arms or other charges that are placed so as to form the shape  of a pile are said to be borne in pile.    [Illustration: In pile]    Ex. Argent, three swords in pile, their points towards the base.    PLATE. One of the six roundlets; its colour is argent, but the  tincture is not mentioned, as the plate is always silver.    POMEIS.

The ancient name of a crutch: when the field is covered with  figures like small crutches it is called potent; when the heads of the  crutches touch each other it is called counter potent.    [Illustration: Potent and counter potent]    Ex. Argent and azure, potent and counter potent. Some armorists call  counter potent vary cuppy.    PRINCE. The only Principality in Great Britain is that of Wales. The  title of Prince of Wales is usually conferred upon the eldest son of  the British monarch. All other sons, grandsons, brothers, uncles, and  nephews, are called princes of the blood royal. For instance, the  Duke of Cambridge, the uncle of Queen Victoria, is styled His Royal  Highness Prince Adolphus Frederick Duke of Cambridge.    His son is styled Prince George of Cambridge.    PRINCESS. Daughter of a sovereign. In England the eldest daughter  of the monarch is called the Princess Royal; the others by their  Christian names.    PROCLAMATION. A publication by the authority of the King.  Proclamations of peace or war, or other matters of importance, are  usually read by one of the heralds. They are addressed to the whole  community under their different orders or ranks, viz. Clergy,  Nobility, Gentry, Burgesses, and Commons.    PROPER. This word is used to denote that animals introduced as charges  in an escutcheon appear in their natural colour. Modern writers on  Heraldry consider this word superfluous, as the omission of the name  of any metal or tincture is quite sufficient to make any person  conclude that a lion, horse, or other animal is to be represented as  it appears in nature.    [Illustration: Purpure]    PURPURE. The colour of purple, described in engraving by lines drawn  diagonally from the sinister to the dexter side of the shield.    PURSUIVANTS. Four officers of the Heralds' College, whose duty it  is to attend the King-at-Arms on public occasions, and preside over  certain departments of the Heralds' Office.    They are called--Rouge Croix,                   Blue Mantle,                   Rouge Dragon,                   Portcullis.    They are entitled to rank as gentlemen, but not esquires.    [Illustration: Quartered]    QUARTERED. A shield divided into four equal parts by a cross is said  to be quartered. The quarter occupying the dexter chief is marked 1,  or the first quarter; that occupying the sinister chief, 2; the dexter  base, 3; the sinister base, 4; as in the annexed example.    QUARTERLY. This term is used to signify that the shield is quartered.  In describing the royal arms of England we should say--Quarterly,  first and fourth gules, three lions passant guardant, or. Second, or,  a lion rampant gules, within a double tressure of the same, flory and  counter flory. Third, azure, a harp or, stringed, argent.    [Illustration: Quartered or Parted per Saltier]    QUARTERED OR PARTED PER SALTIER. A field divided by diagonal lines  crossing each other in the centre of the field.    [Illustration: Quarter foil]    QUARTER FOIL. A four-leaved flower.    QUARTERINGS. An escutcheon divided into any number of squares is said  to contain as many quarterings; they may be as numerous as the arms  required. An escutcheon containing a number of quarterings is called a  genealogical achievement.    QUADRATE. Square. See CROSS QUADRATE.    QUARTER PIERCED. See CROSS QUARTER PIERCED.    RADIENT. Any charge having rays or beams about it.    [Illustration: Radient]    Ex. Azure, a pale, or, radient.    RAGULY. Any bearing that is ragged, like the trunk or limbs of a tree  lopped of its branches, is said to be raguly. See CROSS.    RAMPANT. Any beast in a fighting attitude. See LION RAMPANT.    RAY. A stream of light proceeding from a luminous body.    [Illustration: Ray]    Ex. Azure, a ray of the sun issuing out of the dexter corner of the  escutcheon. The lines on each side are not noticed.    REST. The figure inserted in the illustration of the word \"clarion\" is  by some writers on Heraldry thought to represent a rest for a lance,  and they give the charge that name. See CLARION.    REGARDANT. An animal looking towards the sinister side of the shield.  See LION REGARDANT.    RIBAND. A diminutive of the bend.    [Illustration: Riband]    Ex. Gules, a riband, or.    ROUNDLETS. Small round figures, all named from different metals and  tinctures. See p. 8. [CHAP. II.]    RUBY. A precious stone, formerly used instead of gules.    SABLE. The term used in Heraldry for black.    SALIENT. An animal springing forward. See LION SALIENT.    SALTIER. One of the honourable ordinaries, by Scottish heralds called  St. Andrew's Cross.    [Illustration: Saltier]    Ex. Argent, a saltier, gules    SANGUINE. One of the heraldic tinctures. It is a dark red or blood  colour. By some armorists it is called murrey. The latter word is  considered obsolete.    SAPPHIRE. The name of a precious stone, formerly used to express  azure.    SARDONYX. A precious stone, formerly used to denote sanguine in  emblazoning the arms of the English nobility.    SATURN.

But, although we  cannot work the laws of association forward, we can always work them  backwards. We cannot say now what we shall find ourselves thinking of  five minutes hence; but, whatever it may be, we shall then be able to  trace it through intermediary links of contiguity or similarity to what  we are thinking now. What so baffles our prevision is the shifting part  played by the margin and focus--in fact, by each element by itself of  the margin or focus--in calling up the next ideas.    For example, I am reciting 'Locksley Hall,' in order to divert my mind  from a state of suspense that I am in concerning the will of a relative  that is dead. The will still remains in the mental background as an  extremely marginal or ultra-marginal portion of my field of  consciousness; but the poem fairly keeps my attention from it, until I  come to the line, \"I, the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of  time.\" The words 'I, the heir,' immediately make an electric connection  with the marginal thought of the will; that, in turn, makes my heart  beat with anticipation of my possible legacy, so that I throw down the  book and pace the floor excitedly with visions of my future fortune  pouring through my mind. Any portion of the field of consciousness that  has more potentialities of emotional excitement than another may thus be  roused to predominant activity; and the shifting play of interest now in  one portion, now in another, deflects the currents in all sorts of  zigzag ways, the mental activity running hither and thither as the  sparks run in burnt-up paper.           *       *       *       *       *    One more point, and I shall have said as much to you as seems necessary  about the process of association.    You just saw how a single exciting word may call up its own associates  prepotently, and deflect our whole train of thinking from the previous  track. The fact is that every portion of the field _tends_ to call up  its own associates; but, if these associates be severally different,  there is rivalry, and as soon as one or a few begin to be effective the  others seem to get siphoned out, as it were, and left behind. Seldom,  however, as in our example, does the process seem to turn round a single  item in the mental field, or even round the entire field that is  immediately in the act of passing. It is a matter of _constellation_,  into which portions of fields that are already past especially seem to  enter and have their say. Thus, to go back to 'Locksley Hall,' each word  as I recite it in its due order is suggested not solely by the previous  word now expiring on my lips, but it is rather the effect of all the  previous words, taken together, of the verse. \"Ages,\" for example, calls  up \"in the foremost files of time,\" when preceded by \"I, the heir of all  the\"--; but, when preceded by \"for I doubt not through the,\"--it calls  up \"one increasing purpose runs.\" Similarly, if I write on the  blackboard the letters A B C D E F,... they probably suggest to you G H  I.... But, if I write A B A D D E F, if they suggest anything, they  suggest as their complement E C T or E F I C I E N C Y. The result  depending on the total constellation, even though most of the single  items be the same.    My practical reason for mentioning this law is this, that it follows  from it that, in working associations into your pupils' minds, you must  not rely on single cues, but multiply the cues as much as possible.  Couple the desired reaction with numerous constellations of  antecedents,--don't always ask the question, for example, in the same  way; don't use the same kind of data in numerical problems; vary your  illustrations, etc., as much as you can. When we come to the subject of  memory, we shall learn still more about this.    So much, then, for the general subject of association. In leaving it for  other topics (in which, however, we shall abundantly find it involved  again), I cannot too strongly urge you to acquire a habit of thinking of  your pupils in associative terms. All governors of mankind, from doctors  and jail-wardens to demagogues and statesmen, instinctively come so to  conceive their charges. If you do the same, thinking of them (however  else you may think of them besides) as so many little systems of  associating machinery, you will be astonished at the intimacy of insight  into their operations and at the practicality of the results which you  will gain. We think of our acquaintances, for example, as characterized  by certain 'tendencies.' These tendencies will in almost every instance  prove to be tendencies to association. Certain ideas in them are always  followed by certain other ideas, these by certain feelings and impulses  to approve or disapprove, assent or decline. If the topic arouse one of  those first ideas, the practical outcome can be pretty well foreseen.  'Types of character' in short are largely types of association.          X. INTEREST      At our last meeting I treated of the native tendencies of the pupil to  react in characteristically definite ways upon different stimuli or  exciting circumstances. In fact, I treated of the pupil's instincts. Now  some situations appeal to special instincts from the very outset, and  others fail to do so until the proper connections have been organized in  the course of the person's training. We say of the former set of objects  or situations that they are _interesting_ in themselves and originally.  Of the latter we say that they are natively uninteresting, and that  interest in them has first to be acquired.    No topic has received more attention from pedagogical writers than that  of interest. It is the natural sequel to the instincts we so lately  discussed, and it is therefore well fitted to be the next subject which  we take up.    Since some objects are natively interesting and in others interest is  artificially acquired, the teacher must know which the natively  interesting ones are; for, as we shall see immediately, other objects  can artificially acquire an interest only through first becoming  associated with some of these natively interesting things.    The native interests of children lie altogether in the sphere of  sensation. Novel things to look at or novel sounds to hear, especially  when they involve the spectacle of action of a violent sort, will always  divert the attention from abstract conceptions of objects verbally taken  in. The grimace that Johnny is making, the spitballs that Tommy is ready  to throw, the dog-fight in the street, or the distant firebells  ringing,--these are the rivals with which the teacher's powers of being  interesting have incessantly to cope. The child will always attend more  to what a teacher does than to what the same teacher says. During the  performance of experiments or while the teacher is drawing on the  blackboard, the children are tranquil and absorbed. I have seen a  roomful of college students suddenly become perfectly still, to look at  their professor of physics tie a piece of string around a stick which he  was going to use in an experiment, but immediately grow restless when he  began to explain the experiment. A lady told me that one day, during a  lesson, she was delighted at having captured so completely the attention  of one of her young charges. He did not remove his eyes from her face;  but he said to her after the lesson was over, \"I looked at you all the  time, and your upper jaw did not move once!\" That was the only fact that  he had taken in.    Living things, then, moving things, or things that savor of danger or of  blood, that have a dramatic quality,--these are the objects natively  interesting to childhood, to the exclusion of almost everything else;  and the teacher of young children, until more artificial interests have  grown up, will keep in touch with her pupils by constant appeal to such  matters as these. Instruction must be carried on objectively,  experimentally, anecdotally. The blackboard-drawing and story-telling  must constantly come in. But of course these methods cover only the  first steps, and carry one but a little way.    Can we now formulate any general principle by which the later and more  artificial interests connect themselves with these early ones that the  child brings with him to the school?    Fortunately, we can: there is a very simple law that relates the  acquired and the native interests with each other.    _Any object not interesting in itself may become interesting through  becoming associated with an object in which an interest already exists.  The two associated objects grow, as it were, together: the interesting  portion sheds its quality over the whole; and thus things not  interesting in their own right borrow an interest which becomes as real  and as strong as that of any natively interesting thing._ The odd  circumstance is that the borrowing does not impoverish the source, the  objects taken together being more interesting, perhaps, than the  originally interesting portion was by itself.    This is one of the most striking proofs of the range of application of  the principle of association of ideas in psychology. An idea will infect  another with its own emotional interest when they have become both  associated together into any sort of a mental total. As there is no  limit to the various associations into which an interesting idea may  enter, one sees in how many ways an interest may be derived.    You will understand this abstract statement easily if I take the most  frequent of concrete examples,--the interest which things borrow from  their connection with our own personal welfare. The most natively  interesting object to a man is his own personal self and its fortunes.  We accordingly see that the moment a thing becomes connected with the  fortunes of the self, it forthwith becomes an"]]]
