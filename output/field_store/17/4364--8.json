That which was exhibited in the Crystal Palace of 1851, as \"from  Ghazepore,\" in India, obtained the prize.        \"Attar of roses, made in Cashmere, is considered superior to any      other; a circumstance not surprising, as, according to Hugel, the      flower is here produced of surpassing fragrance as well as beauty.      A large quantity of rose-water twice distilled is allowed to run      off into an open vessel, placed over night in a cool running      stream, and in the morning the oil is found floating on the      surface in minute specks, which are taken off very carefully by      means of a blade of sword-lily. When cool it is of a dark green      color, and as hard as resin, not becoming liquid at a temperature      about that of boiling water. Between 500 and 600 pounds' weight of      leaves is required to produce one ounce of the attar.\"--_Indian      Encyclopaedia._    Pure otto of roses, from its cloying sweetness, has not many admirers;  when diluted, however, there is nothing to equal it in odor, especially  if mixed in soap, to form rose soap, or in pure spirit, to form the  esprit de rose. The soap not allowing the perfume to evaporate very  fast, we cannot be surfeited with the smell of the otto.    The finest preparation of rose as an odor is made at Grasse, in France.  Here the flowers are not treated for the otto, but are subjected to the  process of maceration in fat, or in oil, as described under jasmine,  heliotrope, &c.    The rose pomade thus made, if digested in alcohol, say 8 lbs. of No. 24  Pomade to one gallon of spirit, yields an esprit de rose of the first  order, very superior to that which is made by the addition of otto to  spirit. It is difficult to account for this difference, but it is  sufficiently characteristic to form a distinct odor. See the article on  fleur d'orange and neroli (pp. 77, 78), which have similar qualities,  previously described. The esprit de rose made from the French rose  pomade is never sold retail by the perfumer; he reserves this to form  part of his _recherche_ bouquets.    Some wholesale druggists have, however, been selling it now for some  time to country practitioners, for them to form extemporaneous  rose-water, which it does to great perfection. Roses are cultivated to  a large extent in England, near Mitcham, in Surrey, for perfumers' use,  to make rose-water. In the season when successive crops can be got,  which is about the end of June, or the early part of July, they are  gathered as soon as the dew is off, and sent to town in sacks. When they  arrive, they are immediately spread out upon a cool floor: otherwise, if  left in a heap, they heat to such an extent, in two or three hours, as  to be quite spoiled. There is no organic matter which so rapidly absorbs  oxygen, and becomes heated spontaneously, as a mass of freshly gathered  roses.    To preserve these roses, the London perfumers immediately pickle them;  for this purpose, the leaves are separated from the stalks, and to every  bushel of flowers, equal to about six pounds' weight, one pound of  common salt is thoroughly rubbed in. The salt absorbs the water existing  in the petals, and rapidly becomes brine, reducing the whole to a pasty  mass, which is finally stowed away in casks. In this way they will keep  almost any length of time, without the fragrance being seriously  injured. A good rose-water can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs. of  pickled roses, and 2-1/2 gallons of water. \"Draw\" off two gallons; the  product will be the double-distilled rose-water of the shops. The  rose-water that is imported from the South of France is, however, very  superior in odor to any that can be produced here. As it is a residuary  product of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar, it has a  richness of aroma which appears to be inimitable with English-grown  roses. There are four modifications of essence of rose for the  handkerchief, which are the _ne plus ultra_ of the perfumer's art. They  are,--esprit de rose triple, essence of white of roses, essence of tea  rose, and essence of moss rose. The following are the recipes for their  formation:--    ESPRIT DE ROSE TRIPLE.    Rectified alcohol,      1 gallon.  Otto of rose,               3 oz.    Mix at a summer heat; in the course of a quarter of an hour the whole of  the otto is dissolved, and is then ready for bottling and sale. In the  winter season beautiful crystals of the otto--if it is good--appear  disseminated through the esprit.    ESSENCE OF MOSS ROSE.    Spirituous extract from French Rose pomatum,      1 quart.  Esprit de rose triple,                             1 pint.

By distilling the _Rosmarinus officinalis_ a thin limpid otto is  procured, having the characteristic odor of the plant, which is more  aromatic than sweet. One cwt. of the fresh herb yields about twenty-four  ounces of oil. Otto of rosemary is very extensively used in perfumery,  especially in combination with other ottos for scenting soap. Eau de  Cologne cannot be made without it, and in the once famous \"Hungary  water\" it is the leading ingredient. The following is the composition of    HUNGARY WATER.    Rectified alcohol,                    1 gallon.  Otto of English rosemary,                 2 oz.  \"       lemon-peel,                       1 oz.  \"       balm (_Melissa_),                 1 oz.  \"       mint,                       1/2 drachm.  Esprit de rose,                         1 pint.  Extract of fleur d'orange,              1  \"    It is put up for sale in a similar way to eau de Cologne, and is said to  take its name from one of the queens of Hungary, who is reported to  have derived great benefit from a bath containing it, at the age of  seventy-five years. There is no doubt that clergymen and orators, while  speaking for any time, would derive great benefit from perfuming their  handkerchief with Hungary water or eau de Cologne, as the rosemary they  contain excites the mind to vigorous action, sufficient of the stimulant  being inhaled by occasionally wiping the face with the handkerchief  wetted with these \"waters.\" Shakspeare giving us the key, we can  understand how it is that such perfumes containing rosemary are  universally said to be \"so refreshing!\"    SAGE.--A powerful-scenting otto can be procured by distillation  from any of the _Salvieae_. It is rarely used, but is nevertheless very  valuable in combination for scenting soap.    Dried sage-leaves, ground, will compound well for sachets.    SANTAL.--_Santalum album_.        \"The santal tree perfumes, when riven,      The axe that laid it low.\" CAMERON.    This is an old favorite with the lovers of scent; it is the wood that  possesses the odor. The finest santal-wood grows in the island of Timor,  and the Santal-wood Islands, where it is extensively cultivated for the  Chinese market. In the religious ceremonies of the Brahmins, Hindoos,  and Chinese, santal-wood is burned, by way of incense, to an extent  almost beyond belief. The _Santala_ grew plentifully in China, but the  continued offerings to the Buddahs have almost exterminated the plant  from the Celestial Empire; and such is the demand, that it is about to  be cultivated in Western Australia, in the expectation of a profitable  return, which we doubt not will be realized; England alone would consume  tenfold the quantity it does were its price within the range of other  perfuming substances. The otto which exists in the santal-wood is  readily procured by distillation; 1 cwt. of good wood will yield about  30 ounces of otto.    [Illustration: Santal-wood.]    The white ant, which is so common in India and China, eating into every  organic matter that it comes across, appears to have no relish for  santal-wood; hence it is frequently made into caskets, jewel-boxes,  deed-cases, &c. This quality, together with its fragrance, renders it a  valuable article to the cabinet-makers of the East.    The otto of santal is remarkably dense, and is above all others  oleaginous in its appearance, and, when good, is of a dark straw color.  When dissolved in spirit, it enters into the composition of a great many  of the old-fashioned bouquets, such as \"Marechale,\" and others, the  formulae of which will be given hereafter. Perfumers thus make what is  called    EXTRAIT DE BOIS DE SANTAL.    Rectified spirits,                              7 pints.  Esprit de rose,                                  1 pint.  Essential oil, _i.e._ otto, of santal,             3 oz.    All those EXTRACTS, made by dissolving the otto in alcohol, are  nearly white, or at least only slightly tinted by the color of the oil  used. When a perfumer has to impart a delicate _odeur_ to a lady's  _mouchoir_, which in some instances costs \"no end of money,\" and is an  object, at any cost, to retain unsullied, it behooves his reputation to  sell an article that will not stain a delicate white fabric. Now, when a  perfume is made in a direct manner from any wood or herb, as tinctures  are made, that is, by infusion in alcohol, there is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16399"],[0,"A Winter Tour in South Africa (#12)"],[1,"surroundings, would, I feel satisfied, like, if sufficient  inducement were offered them, to make South Africa their permanent home.  If, therefore, a military colony were established at the expense of the  Home Government in a well and wisely-selected spot and under proper and  judicious arrangement, it would probably be, not only a great boon to a  number of deserving British subjects, but would be attended with  success, and be a politic, and interesting factor in the art of  colonisation.    I earnestly commend the idea to those, who would have to deal with it,  as an experiment, eminently worthy of their attention and support.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    THE POLITICAL SITUATION.      The political situation of South Africa is the last subject to which I  shall refer. I am quite aware that this is a very difficult and delicate  question to touch upon, but it would be impossible for anyone like  myself, to whom it has presented itself so prominently during my tour,  to avoid some allusion to it. I shall endeavour to state my impressions  impartially and fairly.    Before I went to South Africa I had formed a general opinion on this  vitally important and very critical subject. My previous views have been  most thoroughly confirmed, and painfully accentuated by all I have  seen, and heard, and gathered, on the spot. The mournful mismanagement  of South African affairs during the last twenty-five years, and most  especially during the last decade, has been truly lamentable, and cannot  fail to awaken the saddest feelings on the part of every loyal Briton,  and true-hearted patriot.    The absence of continuous, wise, and statesmanlike policy, which has for  the most part marked the tone of those, who have had the Imperial  guidance and control of South African affairs in the past, has had the  effect of sowing the seeds of enmity to the Government of the Mother  Country, which it will require all the wisdom, and tact, and  conciliatory sympathy possible to be displayed in the future, in dealing  with this magnificent part of the Empire, to allay. It will demand the  greatest skill to prevent the permanent alienation, and estrangement of  South Africa from Great Britain.    This has all been brought about by our unaccountably careless and  culpable want of accurate knowledge at home, of the actual situation. We  lost a splendid chance of consolidating South Africa in a homogeneous  union under the British crown. Our insular in difference, our ignorance,  the fierce animosity of our party political prejudices, made us neglect  the opportunity. It has had the effect of creating the sorest feelings  against us, on the part of the large English population, spread over the  land, which is uncontaminated and uninfluenced by the party spirit of  local colonial politicians. It is melancholy, and most deplorable to  observe the indications of this feeling, which are constantly apparent.  The old love for the British flag is still widely cherished; but it was  impossible for me to shut my eyes to the evidence so continually  brought before me, that the British Government is neither loved nor  respected. No confidence whatever is felt in it--and no wonder!  Everywhere there are proofs of how all have been allowed to suffer and  smart under it.    Either from ignorance, or carelessness, or indifference--probably from  all combined--and perhaps even unconsciously, but at the same time as  surely, we have deceived the Natives, the Boers, and the Colonists. This  is only the natural consequence of the feeble, vacillating, uncertain  course, which is followed, when the State machine is guided without  compass, and where there is no firmness, nor courage at the national  helm. What we have to do, however, now, is to advocate union and  co-operation between the two dominant races--the British and the  Dutch--and to do all we can to promote harmony and goodwill between  them. True, their mental character, and natural instincts are  different. Our own race is essentially energetic and progressive; while  theirs is slow, unemotional, and phlegmatic. But if sympathy, and tact,  and cordial good temper, are invariably practised in our intercourse  with them, I am persuaded it will ultimately have the effect of  promoting co-operation in securing their mutual interests. This, I  trust, will ultimately neutralise the effect of the fatal course of past  political action, which unnecessarily developed race jealousies, and  stimulated national friction and animosity; and will bring about in the  future, a blending of the Dutch in friendly union and fellowship with  the British, such as has been undreamed of in the past.    Among many expressions of opinion on the subject of the political  situation made to me while I was in South Africa, I received the  following communication from a gentleman of prominent position in one  of the principal towns of the Cape Colony. It appears to me of such  importance that I avail myself of this opportunity of giving publicity  to it.         \"The fact of your arrival at very short notice, combined with the       fact that there are only a few Fellows of the Royal Colonial       Institute resident here, will probably prevent the presentation of       any formal address of welcome to you.         \"Nevertheless, to a section of the community which is animated by       patriotic jealousy for the rights and dignity of the Crown       throughout South Africa, your visit is regarded with feelings of       genuine satisfaction, and our hopes are encouraged, that your visit       may result in some good to the cause, which we have at heart.         \"You are doubtless acquainted well enough with the principal events       of great national moment of recent years in South Africa. From       whatever point of view politicians may like to regard the end of       the Transvaal war, any resident in this country can be only too       well aware of the fact that one result of that terrible experience       has been, a material weakening of respect for English people, and       for the rights of the Crown throughout the Cape Colony.         \"Since the period referred to, a very powerful Dutch-Africander       combination has come into existence, and there can be no doubt but       that one object of such a body, is the severance of all but nominal       ties between the Cape, and Great Britain.         \"However visionary such hopes as these must for a long series of       years remain, the fact of their existence, and of their being in a       variety of ways advanced from time to time, has a very marked       influence upon all classes of people in this country.         \"For instance, the youth of the country are influenced to hope for       a time, when they shall be members of an independent State; and       while on the one hand they may not see any immediate prospect of a       change in such a direction being effected, nevertheless they lessen       their interest in, and their respect for, the Crown of England and       its attributes, and thus grow up comparatively devoid of any sound       patriotism, even to their native country; and, above all, without       any touch of that enthusiasm, which is ever engendered by high       national traditions.         \"That some momentous changes are likely to occur in South Africa,       and that possibly, before very long, all are agreed. The question       only remains in what direction will these changes tend?--towards       some Foreign Continental Power, towards a Confederation with the       existing Dutch Republics, or in the direction of a strengthening       of the union with England?         \"It is sometimes surmised, and this not merely by extreme men, but       by quiet and experienced observers of events in this country, that       the large population, mainly British, which has been attracted to       the Gold Fields of the Transvaal, is unlikely to endure much longer       the systematic misgovernment and suppression, to which they are       subjected by men of avowedly anti-English sympathies, and pledged       to a policy directed to check British progress by all means.         \"What form the suggested revolt in the Transvaal may take is not       likely to be revealed, until some overt step towards its execution       has been taken. We would all desire that the end in view should be       secured by peaceful means, and that the Transvaal should become a       part and parcel of British territory.         \"To effect a revival of loyalty to England in the Cape Colony, and       to influence the destinies of other States in the direction of       union with England, should surely be the hope and endeavour of all       true Englishmen, whether in this Colony, or elsewhere.         \"And the end in view is not an easy one to attain in a country,       where the majority of Europeans consider that they, or their       compatriots, inflicted disgrace, and a permanent loss of influence       upon the Imperial Troops on the one hand, and the Imperial British       Government on the other.         \"The application of any remedy seems to lie more with the Sovereign       personally, or Her Majesty's immediate advisers in England, than       with any Governor, and High Commissioner, or Cabinet of Cape       Ministers.         \"For _qua_ Governor, the Queen's Representative at the Cape, is       necessarily checked, or controlled by the Ministry of the day, his       Constitutional advisers, and the presence in the Cape Parliament of       a dominant force of the essentially non-English, or Africander       party, must necessarily also have a very material influence upon       Ministers, who depend upon a majority of votes for the retention of       their office.         \"In short, the problem in the Cape Colony is one, which happily       does not exist in either of the other great dependencies of the       Crown; it is"]]]
