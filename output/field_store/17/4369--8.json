Yet even in simple love she uses art,    Tho' weepings are from looser eyes, but leaks;    Yet eldest lovers scarce would doubt her heart,    So well she weeps, as she to Goltho speaks.    During our author's attendance at court, he wrote several plays, and  employed his time in framing masques, which were acted by the  principal nobility of both sexes; the Queen herself condescended to  take a share in one of them, which gave very great offence to the  scrupulous moralists, which sprung up in those days; the particular  account of this dramatic piece we shall give in the conclusion of his  life, and now proceed in enumerating the incidents of it.    Upon the death of Ben Johnson, which happened in the year 1637, our  poet succeeded to his laurel, notwithstanding the violent opposition  of his competitor Thomas May, who was so extremely affected with his  disappointment, though he had been a zealous courtier, yet from  resentment to the Queen, by whose interest Davenant was preferred, he  commenced an enemy to the King's party, and became both an advocate  and historian for the Parliament.    As soon as the civil war broke out, Mr. Davenant had an early share in  them and demonstrated his loyalty by speaking and acting for the King.  He was accused by the Parliament for being embarked in a design in May  1641, of seducing the army from their adherence to the parliamentary  authority, and bringing it again under the subjection of the King, and  defence of his person. In this scheme many of Sir William's friends  were engaged, viz. Mr. Henry Piercy, afterwards lord Piercy, Mr.  Goring, Mr. Jermyn, Mr. Ashburnham, Sir John Suckling, and others:  most of these persons, upon their design being discovered, placed  their security in flight, and Mr. Davenant amongst the rest; but a  proclamation being published for apprehending him, he was stopped at  Feversham, sent up to town, and put into the custody of a sergeant at  arms[2]. In the month of July following, our author was bailed, and  not long after finding it necessary, on account of the violence of the  times, to withdraw to France, he had the misfortune to be seized again  in Kent by the Mayor of Canterbury; how he escaped the present danger,  none of his biographers have related, but it appears that he did not,  upon this occasion, suffer long confinement; he at last retired beyond  sea, where he continued for some time, but the Queen sending over a  considerable quantity of military stores, for the use of the earl of  Newcastle's army, Mr. Davenant returned again to England, offered his  service to that noble peer, who was his old friend and patron, and by  him made lieutenant-general of his ordnance: this promotion gave  offence to many, who were his rivals in his lordship's esteem: they  remonstrated, that Sir William Davenant, being a poet, was, for that  very reason, unqualified for a place of so much trust, and which  demanded one of a solid, and less volatile turn of mind, than the sons  of Parnassus generally are. In this complaint they paid but an  indifferent compliment to the General himself, who was a poet, and had  written, and published several plays. That Davenant behaved well in  his military capacity is very probable, since, in the month of  September, 1643, he received the honour of knighthood from the King,  at the siege of Gloucester, an acknowledgment of his bravery, and  signal services, which bestowed at a time when a strict scrutiny was  made concerning the merit of officers, puts it beyond doubt, that  Davenant, in his martial character, was as deserving as in his  poetical. During these severe contentions, and notwithstanding his  public character, our author's muse sometimes raised her voice, in the  composition of several plays, of which we shall give some account when  we enumerate his dramatic performances. History is silent as to the  means which induced Davenant to quit the Northern army, but as soon as  the King's affairs so far declined, as to afford no hopes of a  revival, he judged it necessary to retire into France, where he was  extremely well received by the Queen, into whose confidence he had the  honour to be taken, and was intrusted with the negotiation of matters  of the highest importance, in the summer of the year 1646. Before this  time Sir William had embraced the popish religion, which circumstance  might so far ingratiate him with the queen, as to trust him with the  most important concerns. Lord Clarendon, who had a particular esteem  for him, has given a full account of this affair, though not much to  his advantage, but yet with all the tenderness due to Sir William's  good intentions, and of that long and intimate acquaintance that had  subsisted between them; which is the more worthy the reader's notice,  as it has entirely escaped the observation of all those, who have  undertaken to write this gentleman's Memoirs, though the most  remarkable passage in his whole life.    The King, in retiring to the Scots, had followed the advice of the  French ambassador, who had promised on their behalf, if not more than  he had authority to do, at least, more than they were inclined to  perform; to justify, however, his conduct at home, he was inclined to  throw the weight, in some measure, upon the King, and with this view,  he, by an express, informed cardinal Mazarine, that his Majesty was  too reserved in giving the Parliament satisfaction, and therefore  desired that some person might be sent over, who had a sufficient  degree of credit with the English Monarch, to persuade him to such  compliances, as were necessary for his interest. 'The Queen, says the  noble historian, who was never advised by those, who either  understood, or valued her Husband's interest, consulted those about  her, and sent Sir William Davenant, an honest man, and a witty, but in  all respects unequal to such a trust, with a letter of credit to the  King, who knew the person well enough under another character than was  likely to give him much credit upon the argument, with which he was  entrusted, although the Queen had likewise otherwise declared her  opinion to his Majesty, that he should part with the church for his  peace and security.' Sir William had, by the countenance of the French  ambassador, easy admission to the King, who heard patiently all he had  to say, and answered him in a manner, which demonstrated that he was  not pleased with the advice. When he found his Majesty unsatisfied,  and not disposed to consent to what was earnestly desired by those by  whom he had been sent, who undervalued all those scruples of  conscience, with which his Majesty was so strongly possessed, he took  upon himself the liberty of offering some reasons to the king, to  induce him to yield to what was proposed, and among other things said,  it was the opinion and advice of all his friends; his Majesty asked,  what friends? to which Davenant replied, lord Jermyn, and lord  Colepepper; the King upon this observed, that lord Jermyn did not  understand any thing of the church, and that Colepepper was of no  religion; but, says his Majesty, what is the opinion of the Chancellor  of the Exchequer? to which Davenant answered, he did not know, that he  was not there, and had deserted the Prince, and thereupon mentioned  the Queen's displeasure against the Chancellor; to which the King  said, 'The Chancellor was an honest man, and would never desert him  nor the Prince, nor the Church; and that he was sorry he was not with  his son, but that his wife was mistaken.'    Davenant then offering some reasons of his own, in which he treated  the church with indignity, his Majesty was so transported with anger,  that he gave him a sharper rebuke than he usually gave to any other  man, and forbad him again, ever to presume to come into his presence;  upon which poor Davenant was deeply affected, and returned into France  to give an account of his ill success to those who sent him.    Upon Davenant's return to Paris, he associated with a set of people,  who endeavoured to alleviate the distresses of exile by some kind of  amusement. The diversion, which Sir William chose was of the literary  sort, and having long indulged an inclination of writing an heroic  poem, and having there much leisure, and some encouragement, he was  induced to undertake one of a new kind; the two first books of which  he finished at the Louvre, where he lived with his old friend Lord  Jermyn; and these with a preface, addressed to Mr. Hobbs, his answer,  and some commendatory poems, were published in England; of which we  shall give some further account in our animadversions upon Gondibert.    While he employed himself in the service of the muses, Henrietta  Maria, the queen dowager of England whose particular favourite he was  found out business for him of another nature. She had heard that vast  improvements might be made in the loyal colony of Virginia, in case  proper artificers were sent there; and there being many of these in  France"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#12)"],[1,"ader. The defence of  Potchefstroom by Colonel Winslow should be read in full for several  reasons. The siege of Standerton witnessed several acts of valour,  but, above all, that of Hall the volunteer, who single handed  deliberately engaged a force of over 300 Boers, drawing their fire on  himself in order to warn his comrades of the danger of being cut off  and to give them a chance of escape--a noble act in which the gallant  fellow achieved his object but lost his life. It was in Rustenberg  where Captain Auchinleck, with about seventy men armed only with  rifles, held his laager against hundreds of the enemy, fighting day  and night for weeks; and eventually drove off the Boers who were  trenching towards his position by charging at night with from nine to  fourteen of his men and clearing the enemy out of the trenches with  the bayonet. This performance he repeated three times, himself badly  wounded on each occasion. The impression created on the enemy by  these tactics was such that they overcame their desire to get at  close quarters with him, and left him severely alone.    It is not necessary to refer in great detail to the settlement In  effect it was that the Boers gained nearly all that they required,  but not until the haggling and threatening had robbed concessions of  all appearance of grace and justice. The natives were referred to in  the conventional spirit. The unfortunate loyalists were left to take  care of themselves. The men who had entered the Transvaal, and  invested their capital and expended their energies there upon the  most positive and sacred assurances of the British Government that  the Queen's authority would never be withdrawn,--assurances given in  public by the Conservative Government and confirmed by Mr.  Gladstone's Government, assurances published by Sir Bartle Frere and  Sir Garnet Wolseley, who said that 'as long as the sun would shine  the British flag would fly over the Transvaal,'--were heartlessly  abandoned, their protests were unheeded, the compensation allotted to  them, namely, L1,400,000, was amended by the elimination of the  million, their representations to Mr. Gladstone's Government were  finally left unanswered--unless it be that the sneering reference  made by that right honourable gentleman in the House of Commons to  'interested contractors and landjobbers' may be considered an  adequate answer to a protest as moderate, as able, as truthful, and  as necessary as Mr. Gladstone's remark was the reverse. In very  truth, the position in which the British Premier had placed himself  through his intemperate speeches in the Midlothian campaign, and his  subsequent 'explaining away,' was an extremely unpleasant one. In  Opposition Mr. Gladstone had denounced the annexation and demanded a  repeal. On accession to power he adopted the policy of his  predecessors, and affirmed that the annexation could never be  revoked. On June 8, 1880, he had written to this effect to Messrs.  Kruger and Joubert, the Transvaal deputation. Later on, in answer to  an appeal that he should allay the apprehensions of the loyalists,  who feared the results of the Boer agitation, he referred them to  this very letter as a final expression of opinion, and authorized the  publication of this message. When, however, peace had been concluded,  and the loyalists, amazed and heartbroken at their threatened  desertion, reminded him of his pledges and implored him to respect  them, he answered them in a letter which is surely without parallel  in the record of self-respecting Governments. The wriggling, the  equivocation, the distortion of phrases, the shameless 'explaining  away,' are of a character that would again justify the remark of  Lord Salisbury (then Lord Robert Cecil) in another matter many years  before, that they were 'tactics worthy of a pettifogging attorney,'  and even the subsequent apology--to the attorney. But what answer  could be made to a protest which reminded the right honourable  gentlemen of the following deliberate and official expression of his  Government's policy?--    In your letter to me (wrote Mr. White for the loyalists) you claim  that the language of your letter does not justify the description  given. With the greatest respect I submit that it does, and I will  quote the words on which I and also my colleagues base the opinion  that it does unequivocally pledge the Government to the  non-relinquishment of the Transvaal.    The actual words of your letter are:    'Looking at all the circumstances, both of the Transvaal and the rest  of South Africa, and to the necessity of preventing a renewal of the  disorders, which might lead to disastrous consequences, not only to  the Transvaal, but to the whole of South Africa, _our judgment is  that the Queen cannot be advised to relinquish the Transvaal_; but,  consistently with the maintenance of that sovereignty, we desire that  the white inhabitants of the Transvaal should, without prejudice to  the rest of the population, enjoy the fullest liberty to manage their  local affairs.'    But your letter of the 8th of June not only contained this final and  absolute announcement of the policy of England, but it gave the  reasons for arriving at it in words which so aptly express the case  of the loyalists that I quote them _in extenso_. They are as follows:    'It is undoubtedly matter for much regret that it should, since the  annexation, have appeared that so large a number of the population of  Dutch origin in the Transvaal are opposed to the annexation of that  territory, _but it is impossible now to consider that question as if  it were presented for the first time_. We have to do with a state of  things which has existed for a considerable period, _during which  obligations have been contracted_, especially, though not  exclusively, towards the native population, _which cannot be set  aside_.'    In your speech in the House of Commons, on the debate on Mr. Peter  Rylands' motion condemning the annexation of the country and the  enforcement of British supremacy in it, which was defeated by a  majority of ninety-six, on the 21st of January in the current year,  you used words of similar import. You are reported in the _Times_ of  the 22nd of January as saying:    'To disapprove the annexation of a country is one thing; to abandon  that annexation is another. Whatever we do, we must not blind  ourselves to the legitimate consequences of facts. By the annexation  obligations entailed by the annexation, and if in my opinion, and in  the opinion of many on this side of the House, wrong was done by the  annexation itself, _that would not warrant us in doing fresh,  distinct, and separate wrong by a disregard of the obligation which  that annexation entailed_. These obligations have been referred to in  this debate, and have been mentioned in the compass of a single  sentence. First, there was the obligation entailed towards the  English and other settlers in the Transvaal, perhaps including a  minority, though a very small minority, of the Dutch Boers  themselves; secondly, there was the obligation to the native races;  and thirdly, there was the obligation we entailed upon ourselves in  respect of the responsibility which was already incumbent upon us,  and which we, by the annexation, largely extended, for the future  peace and tranquillity of South Africa.'    Nor was this all. The loyalists proceeded to remind him that Lord  Kimberley, his Secretary of State for the Colonies, had telegraphed  in May, 1880, 'Under no circumstances can the Queen's authority in  the Transvaal be relinquished,' and had confirmed the telegram in a  despatch following; and that his lordship had also stated in the  House of Lords on May 24 that '... after a careful consideration of  the position, we have come to the conclusion that we could not  relinquish the Transvaal. Nothing could be more unfortunate than  uncertainty in respect to such a matter.' (Hansard, cclii., p. 208.)    The effects of the settlement, and the exposures in connection with  it, and the attitude of the Imperial Government were most deplorable.  No credit was given by the Boers to a Government which was clearly  moved by the meanest considerations. No feeling but contempt,  disgust, and even hatred, could be entertained by the loyalists for  the Government which had so shamelessly deserted them. The settlement  has left its indelible mark upon the sentiment of South Africa. The  war, it will generally be admitted, was a most unfortunate  occurrence. Only one thing could have been more unfortunate, and that  was such a settlement as actually was effected--a settlement which  satisfied no one, which outraged all, which threw South Africa into a  state of boiling discontent. In some quarters the defeats of Majuba  and Laing's Nek rankled deeply; yet they were fair fights, and Time  can be trusted to allay the feelings of those who are worsted in a  fair fight; but there were other matters which roused a spirit in  the English-speaking people of South Africa that had never been  known before.    The former records of the Boers, favourable and unfavourable, are  consistent with the records established in the War of Independence.  None dare belittle the spirit which moved them to take up arms  against the greatest Power in the world. Their ignorance may have  been great, but not so great as to blind them to the fact that they  were undertaking an unequal contest. It is not possible to say, with  due regard to their records, that they are not a courageous people.  Individual bravery, of the kind which takes no heed of personal risk,  reckless heroic dash, they have not, nor do they pretend to have.  Their system is entirely otherwise. They do not seek fighting for  fighting's sake. They do not like exposing themselves to risk and  danger. Their caution and their care for personal safety are such  that, judged by the standard of other people's conduct in similar"]]]
