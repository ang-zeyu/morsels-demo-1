[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14431"],[0,"International Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science, Vol. 1, (#12)"],[1,"recollections of a school life are connected with a    large, rambling Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of    England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and    where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a    dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this    moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its    deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand    shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep    hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each, hour, with sullen and    sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the    fretted Gothic steeple lay embedded and asleep. It gives me, perhaps,    as much of pleasure, as I can now in any manner experience to dwell    upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns. Steeped in    misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I shall be pardoned for    seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few    rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even    ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious    importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I    recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterward    so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember. The house. I have    said, was old and irregular. The grounds were extensive, and a high    and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass,    encompassed the whole. The prison-like rampart formed the limit of our    domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week--once every Saturday    afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take    brief walks in a body through some of the neighboring fields--and    twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to    the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of    this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a    spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our    remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended    the pulpit! This reverend man with countenance so demurely benign,    with robes so glossy, and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely    powdered, so rigid and so vast,--could this be he who, of late, with    sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand,    the Draconian Laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly    monstrous for solution! At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a    more ponderous gate. It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and    surmounted with jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did    it inspire! It was never opened save for the three periodical    egressions and ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of    its mighty hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery--a world of matter    for solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation. The extensive    inclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. Of    these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground. It    was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well remember it had    no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of course it    was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre, planted    with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed    only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first advent to school or    final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having    called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or    Midsummer holidays. But the house!--how quaint an old building was    this!--to me how veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really    no end to its windings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was    difficult, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its    two stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there    were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent.    Then the lateral branches were innumerable--inconceivable--and so    returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to    the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we    pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I    was never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality    lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen    or twenty other scholars. The school-room was the largest in the    house--I could not help thinking, in the world. It was very long,    narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of    oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square inclosure of    eight or ten feet, comprising the _sanctum_, 'during hours,' of our    principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with    massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the 'Dominie,' we    would all have willingly perished by the _peine forte et dure_. In    other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced,    indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit    of the 'classical' usher, one of the 'English and mathematical.'    Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless    irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient and    time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so    beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque    figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have    entirely lost what little of original form might have been their    portion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one    extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the    other.      \"Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed,    yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my    life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of    incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of    a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth    has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must    believe that my first mental development had in it much of the    uncommon--even much of the _outre_. Upon mankind at large the events    of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite    impression. All is gray shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an    indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains.    With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with the energy    of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as    deep; and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian medals. Yet    the fact--in the fact of the world's view-how little was there to    remember. The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the    connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays and    perambulations; the playground, with its broils, its pastimes, its    intrigues; these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to    involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an    universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and    spirit-stirring. '_Oh, le bon temps, que se siecle de fer!_'\"    In 1822, he returned to the United States, and after passing a few  months at an academy in Richmond, he entered the University at  Charlottesville, where he led a very dissipated life; the manners which  then prevailed there were extremely dissolute, and he was known as the  wildest and most reckless student of his class; but his unusual  opportunities, and the remarkable ease with which he mastered the most  difficult studies, kept him all the while in the first rank for  scholarship, and he would have graduated with the highest honors, had  not his gambling, intemperance, and other vices, induced his expulsion  from the university.    At this period he was noted for feats of hardihood, strength, and  activity; and on one occasion, in a hot day of June, he swam from  Richmond to Warwick, seven miles and a half, against a tide running  probably from two to three miles an hour.[A] He was expert at fence, had  some skill in drawing, and was a ready and eloquent conversationist and  declaimer.      [Footnote A: This statement was first printed during Mr. Poe's lifetime,  and its truth being questioned in some of the journals, the following  certificate was published by a distinguished gentleman of Virginia:    \"I was one of several who witnessed this swimming feat. We accompanied  Mr. Poe in boats. Messrs. Robert Stannard, John Lyle, (since dead) Robert  Saunders, John Munford, I think, and one or two others, were also of the  party. Mr. P. did not seem at all fatigued, and _walked_ back to Richmond  immediately after the feat--which was undertaken for a wager.    \"ROBERT G. CABELL.\"]      His allowance of money while at Charlottesville had been liberal, but he  quitted the place very much in debt; and when Mr. Allan refused to accept  some of the drafts with which he had paid losses in gaming, he wrote to  him an abusive letter, quitted his house, and soon after left the country  with the quixotic intention of joining the Greeks, then in the midst of  their struggle with the Turks. He never reached his destination, and we  know but little of his adventures in Europe for nearly a year. By the end  of this time he had made his way to St. Petersburg, and our Minister in  that capital, the late Mr. Henry Middleton, of South Carolina, was  ummoned one morning to save him from penalties incurred in a drunken  debauch. Through Mr. Middleton's kindness he was set at liberty and  enabled to return to this country.

In this climate one likes to get wet. The  ground was sodden and deep with muck. Within a mile of camp we saw many  fresh buffalo tracks.    This time we went downhill and still downhill through openings among  batches of great forest trees. The new leaves were just coming out in  pinks and russets, so that the effect at a little distance was almost  precisely that of our autumn foliage in its duller phases. So familiar  were made some of the low rounded knolls that for an instant we were  respectively back in the hills of Surrey or Michigan, and told each  other so.    Thus we moved slowly out from the dense cover to the grass openings. Far  over on another ridge F. called my attention to something jet-black and  indeterminate. In another country I should have named it as a charred  log on an old pine burning, for that was precisely what it looked like.  We glanced at it casually through our glasses. It was a sable buck lying  down right out in the open. He was black and sleek, and we could make  out his sweeping scimitar horns.    Memba Sasa and the Swahili dropped flat on their faces while F. and I  crawled slowly and cautiously through the mud until we had gained the  cover of a shallow ravine that ran in the beast's general direction.  Noting carefully a certain small thicket as landmark, we stooped and  moved as fast as we could down to that point of vantage. There we  cautiously parted the grasses and looked. The sable had disappeared. The  place where he had been lying was plainly to be identified, and there  was no cover save a tiny bush between two and three feet high. We were  quite certain he had neither seen nor winded us. Either he had risen  and fled forward into the ravine up which we had made our stalk, or else  he had entered the small thicket. F. agreed to stay on watch where he  was, while I slipped back and examined the earth to leeward of the  thicket.    I had hardly crawled ten yards, however, before the gentle snapping of  F.'s fingers recalled me to his side.    \"He's behind that bush,\" he whispered in my ear.    I looked. The bush was hardly large enough to conceal a setter dog, and  the sable is somewhat larger than our elk. Nevertheless F. insisted that  the animal was standing behind it, and that he had caught the toss of  its head. We lay still for some time, while the soft, warm rain drizzled  down on us, our eyes riveted on the bush. And then we caught the  momentary flash of curved horns as the sable tossed his head. It seemed  incredible even then that the tiny bush should conceal so large a beast.  As a matter of fact we later found that the bush grew on a slight  elevation, behind which was a depression. In this the sable stood,  patiently enduring the drizzle.    We waited some time in hopes he would move forward a foot or so; but  apparently he had selected his loafing place with care, and liked it.  The danger of a shift of wind was always present. Finally I slipped back  over the brink of the ravine, moved three yards to the left, and crawled  up through the tall dripping grass to a new position behind a little  bush. Cautiously raising my head, I found I could see plainly the  sable's head and part of his shoulders. My position was cramped and out  of balance for offhand shooting; but I did my best, and heard the loud  plunk of the hit. The sable made off at a fast though rather awkward  gallop, wheeled for an instant a hundred yards farther on, received  another bullet in the shoulder, and disappeared over the brow of the  hill. We raced over the top to get in another shot, and found him stone  dead.    He was a fine beast, jet-black in coat, with white markings on the face,  red-brown ears, and horns sweeping up and back scimitar fashion. He  stood four feet and six inches at the shoulder, and his horns were the  second best ever shot in British East Africa. This beast has been  described by Heller as a new subspecies, and named Rooseveltii. His  description was based upon an immature buck and a doe shot by Kermit  Roosevelt. The determination of subspecies on so slight evidence seems  to me unscientific in the extreme. While the immature males do exhibit  the general brown tone relied on by Mr. Heller, the mature buck differs  in no essential from the tropical sable. I find the alledged subspecies  is not accepted by European scientists.          XI.    A MARCH ALONG THE COAST.      With a most comfortable feeling that my task was done, that suddenly the  threatening clouds of killing work had been cleared up, I was now  privileged to loaf and invite my soul on this tropical green hilltop  while poor F. put in the days trying to find another sable. Every  morning he started out before daylight. I could see the light of his  lantern outside the tent; and I stretched myself in the luxurious  consciousness that I should hear no deprecating but insistent \"hodie\"  from my boy until I pleased to invite it. In the afternoon or evening F.  would return, quite exhausted and dripping, with only the report of new  country traversed. No sable; no tracks of sable; no old signs, even, of  sable. Gradually it was borne in on me how lucky I was to have come upon  my magnificent specimen so promptly and in such favourable  circumstances.    A leisurely breakfast alone, with the sun climbing; then the writing of  notes, a little reading, and perhaps a stroll to the village or along  the top of the ridge. At the heat of noon a siesta with a cool cocoanut  at my elbow. The view was beautiful on all sides; our great tree full of  birds; the rising and dying winds in the palms like the gathering  oncoming rush of the rains. From mountain to mountain sounded the wild,  far-carrying ululations of the natives, conveying news or messages  across the wide jungle. Towards sunset I wandered out in the groves,  enjoying the many bright flowers, the tall, sweet grasses, and the  cocoa-palms against the sky. Piles of cocoanuts lay on the ground,  covered each with a leaf plaited in a peculiarly individual manner to  indicate ownership. Small boys, like little black imps, clung naked  half-way up the slim trunks of the palms, watching me bright-eyed above  the undergrowth. In all directions, crossing and recrossing, ran a maze  of beaten paths. Each led somewhere, but it would require the memory  of--well, of a native, to keep all their destinations in mind.    I used to follow some of them to their ending in little cocoa-leaf  houses on the tops of knolls or beneath mangoes; and would talk with the  people. They were very grave and very polite, and seemed to be living  out their lives quite correctly according to their conceptions. Again,  it was borne in on me that these people are not stumbling along the  course of evolution in our footsteps, but have gone as far in their path  as we have in ours; that they have reached at least as complete a  correspondence with their environment as we with our own.[4]    If F. had not returned by the time I reached camp, I would seat myself  in my canvas chair, and thence dispense justice, advice, or medical  treatment. If none of these things seemed demanded, I smoked my pipe. To  me one afternoon came a big-framed, old, dignified man, with the heavy  beard, the noble features, the high forehead, and the blank statue eyes  of the blind Homer. He was led by a very small, very bright-eyed naked  boy. At some twenty feet distance he squatted down cross-legged before  me. For quite five minutes he sat there silent, while I sat in my camp  chair, smoked and waited. At last he spoke in a rolling deep bass voice  rich and vibrating--a delight to hear.    \"Jambo (greeting)!\" said he.    \"Jambo!\" I replied mildly.    Again a five-minute silence. I had begun reading, and had all but  forgotten his presence.    \"Jambo bwana (greeting, master)!\" he rolled out.    \"Jambo!\" I repeated.    The same dignified, unhasting pause.    \"Jambo bwana m'kubwa (greeting, great master)!\"    \"Jambo!\" quoth I, and went on reading. The sun was dropping, but the old  man seemed in no hurry.    \"Jambo bwana m'kubwa sana (greeting, most mighty master)!\" he boomed at  last.    \"Jambo!\" said I.    This would seem to strike the superlative, and I expected now that he  would state his business, but the old man had one more shot in his  locker.    \"Jambo bwana m'kubwa kabeesa sana (greeting, mightiest possible  master)!\" it came.    Then in due course he delicately hinted that a gift of tobacco would not  come amiss.    F. returned a trifle earlier than usual, to admit that his quest was  hopeless, that his physical forces were for the time being at an end,  and that he was willing to go home.    Accordingly very early next morning we set out by the glimmer of a  lantern, hoping to get a good start on our journey before the heat of  the day became too severe. We did gain something, but performed several  unnecessary loops and semicircles in the maze of beaten paths before we  finally struck into one that led down the slope towards the sea. Shortly  after the dawn came up \"like thunder\" in its swiftness, followed almost  immediately by the sun.    Our way now led along the wide flat between the seashore and the Shimba  Hills, in which we had been hunting. A road ten feet wide and innocent  of wheels ran with obstinate directness up and down the slight contours  and through the bushes and cocoanut groves that lay in its path. So  mathematically straight was it that only when perspective closed it in,  or when it dropped over the summit of a little rise, did the eye lose  the effect of its interminability. The country through which this road  led was various--open bushy veld with sparse trees, dense jungle,  cocoanut groves, tall and cool. In the shadows of the latter were the  thatched native villages. To the left always ran the blue Shimba Hills;  and far away to the right somewhere we heard the grumbling of the sea."]]]
