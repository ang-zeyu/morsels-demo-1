At first acquaintance you will not care much for _pic-a-pou_ or the wine  of the country, but with patience you may possibly learn to appreciate  the Vin de Jurancon. Tradition has it that Henri Quatre's nurses  preferred to give this form of nourishment rather than the Mellin's Food  of the time. Perhaps babies were differently constituted in those days.    In any case you will always be able to get a good bottle of claret,  bearing the name of some first-class Bordeaux firm, such as Johnson,  Barton Guestier, or Luze, etc. If you are lucky enough to obtain a glass  of genuine old Armagnac, you will probably rank it, as a liqueur, very  nearly as high as any cognac you have ever tasted.    A word of warning! Don't be too eager to order whisky and soda. The  \"Scotch\" is not of uniform quality.    So much for eatables and drinkables. A few hints now as to where you  might care to lunch or dine.      Pau    To begin with Pau. There is really a great artist there--a man whose  sole hobby is his kitchen, and who, if he chooses, can send you up a  dinner second to none. His name is Guichard. Go and have a talk with  him. Hear what he has to say on the _fond-de-cuisine_ theory. Let him  arrange your menu and await the result with confidence. That confidence  will not be misplaced.    For purely local dishes of the _cuisine-bourgeoise_ type, you might try  a meal at the Hotel de la Poste. But for general comfort the English  Club stands easily first. The coffee-room is run admirably, and as for  wine and cigars, they are as good as money can buy. A strong remark, eh?  But true, nevertheless. For a supper after the play you might give a  trial to the restaurant at the new Palais d'Hiver. Other restaurants are  at the Hotel de France and the Hotel Gassion.    For confectionery, cakes, candied fruits, etc., Luc or Seghin will be  found quite A1. Whilst for five o'clock tea, Madame Bouzoum has  deservedly gained a reputation as great as that of Rumpelmayer on the  Riviera. But again a word of warning! Be discreet as to repeating any  local tittle-tattle you may possibly overhear. So much for Pau.    Throughout the mountain resorts of the Pyrenees, such as  Luchon--Bagneres de Bigorre, Gavarnie, St-Sauveur; Cauterets--Eaux  Bonnes, Eaux Chaudes, Oloron, etc., you can always, as was stated  previously, rely upon getting an averagely well-served luncheon or  dinner, and nothing more--trout and chicken, although excellent, being  inevitable. But there is one splendid and notable exception, viz., the  Hotel de France at Argeles-Gazost, kept by Joseph Peyrafitte, known to  his intimates as \"Papa.\" In his way he is as great an artist as the  aforementioned Guichard; the main difference between the methods of the  two professors being that the latter's art is influenced by the  traditions of the Parisian school, while the former is more of an  impressionist, and does not hesitate to introduce local colour with  broad effects,--merely a question of taste after all. For this reason  you should not fail to pay a visit to Argeles to make the acquaintance  of Monsieur Peyrafitte. Ask him to give you a luncheon such as he  supplies to the golf club of which Lord Kilmaine is president, and for  dinner (being always mindful of the value of local colour) consult him,  over a glass of Quinquina and vermouth, as to some of the dishes  mentioned earlier in this article. You won't regret your visit.    In conclusion, should you find yourself anywhere near Lourdes at the  time of the Pelerinage National, go and dine at one of the principal  hotels there--say the Hotel de la Grotte. You will not dine either well  or comfortably, the pandemonium being indescribable. But you will have  gained an experience which you will not readily forget. _Adishat!_      Provence    Any one who is making a leisurely journey from Marseilles to the Roman  cities of Provence, and who halts by the way at Martigues, the \"Venice  of Provence\" should breakfast at the Hotel Chabas; and if M. Paul Chabas  is still in the land of the living, as I trust he is, and you can  persuade him--telling him that he is the best cook in Provence, which he  is--to make you some of the Provencal dishes, the _Bouillabaisse_, or  that excellent _vol-au-vent_ which they call a _Tourte_ in the land of  Tartaria, or the _Sou Fassu_, which is a cabbage stuffed with a most  savoury mixture of vegetable and meat, you will be fortunate. At Arles  the Hotel Forum has a cook who is a credit to his native province; but  if you stay in the house, make sure that you have a room to the front,  otherwise you may only look into the well-like covered court of the  house. At Tarascon, if you feel inclined to hunt for the imaginary home  of the imaginary hero, a great man whom the town repudiates as having  been invented in order that the world should be amused at its expense,  take your meal at the Hotel des Empereurs and ask for M. Andrieu. At  Avignon the Hotel de l'Europe is a very old-fashioned house with old  furniture in the rooms, old latches to the doors. The servants seem to  have caught the spirit of the place, and there is one old servitor,  still, I trust, alive, who might have been the model for all the  faithful old servants in the plays of the Comedie Francaise. The house  is kept by an old lady; the cook is a man. Several people of my  acquaintance choose Avignon as their halting-place on their way to the  Riviera because of the quaintness of the old hotel and of the excellence  of its cuisine. A breakfast on the Isle de Barthelasse, when the mistral  is not blowing, is one of the holiday treats of the inhabitants of the  town. At Remoulins the old Ledenon wine at the one hotel in the place is  worth a note. At St-Remy, M. Teston, who keeps the hotel named after  him, is an excellent cook. At Nimes, at the Hotel du Cheval Blanc, there  used to be some excellent old Armagnac brandy, and probably some of it  still remains.      \"Cure\" Places    Most of the French cure places are for invalids and invalids only, and  the gourmet who goes to them has to lay aside his critical faculties and  to be content with the simplest fare, well or indifferently cooked,  according to his choice of an hotel.      Aix-les-Bains    The big Savoy town of baths is the principal exception to the rule, for  the baccarat in the two Casinos draws all the big gamblers in Europe to  the place, and one half of Aix-les-Bains goes to bed about the time that  the other half is being carried in rough sedan chairs to be parboiled  and massaged.    In the late spring there is an exodus from the Riviera to Aix-les-Bains;  doctors, _maitres d'hotel_ musicians, lawyers, fly-men, waiters move  into summer quarters; and any one who has time to spare, and enjoys a  three-day drive through beautiful scenery, might well do worse than make  a bargain with a fly-man for the trip from the coast to the town on the  banks of the lake. When a fly-man does not secure a \"monsieur\" as a  passenger, he as often as not drives a brace of friendly waiters over  just for company sake. Thus any gourmet who knows his Riviera finds  himself surrounded by friendly faces at Aix-les-Bains. There are  excellent restaurants in some of the larger hotels, and you can dine in  a garden, under lanterns lit by electric light, or on a glassed-in  terrace whence a glimpse of the lake of Le Bourget under the moon may be  obtained; and there are at the big Casino, the Cercle as it is called,  and at the smaller one, the Ville des Fleurs, quite excellent  restaurants. These two restaurants are managed by first-class men from  the Riviera--the proprietors of the London House at Nice and of the  Reserve at Beaulieu, were, I believe, last year the men in command--and  the King of Greece, who is a gourmet of the first water, sets a  praiseworthy example when he is at Aix of dining one day at the Cercle  and the next at the Villa. The prices are Riviera prices and the cooking  Riviera cooking.    The Anglo-American bar, nearly opposite the principal entrance to the  Cercle, a bar where a whisky and soda costs two francs, always has its  tiny dining-room crowded. Durret's, also opposite the Cercle, a small  restaurant, is good and cheap. There are half-a-dozen little restaurants  in the street running down to the station, but the sampling of the most  likely looking one did not encourage me to try any further experiments.    To keep up the illusion that Aix-les-Bains is a part of the Riviera,  there is a Rumpelmayer cake-shop within two minutes' walk of the Villa  des Fleurs.    Many of the excursions from Aix have a little restaurant as the point to  be reached. At Grand Port, the fishing village on the borders of the  lake of Le Bourget, there is a pleasant house to breakfast at, the  Beaurivage, with a garden from which an excellent view of the lake and  the little bathing place can be obtained. They make a _Bouillabaisse_ of  fresh-water fish at this restaurant which is well worth eating and which  is generally the Friday fare there. At Chambotte, where there is a fine  view of the lake, Lansard has a hotel and restaurant. At Marlioz, near  the race-course and an inhalation and bathing establishment, the pretty  ladies of Aix often call a halt to breakfast, _Ecrevisses Bordelaises_  being a speciality. At one of the little mountain inns, I fancy that of  La Chambotte, the proprietor has married a Scotch wife, and her  excellent cakes, made after the manner of her fatherland, come as a  surprise to the French tourists. The chalets at the summit of the Grand  Revard belong, I believe, to Mme. Ritz, wife of the Emperor of Hotels,  and the feeding there naturally is excellent.    Most people who go a trip to the Lac d'Annecy breakfast on the boat,  though I believe there is a fair breakfast to be obtained at the  Angleterre. On the boat a very ample meal is provided--the trout  generally being excellent--which occupies the attention of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#12)"],[1,"for our departure were made the very next day after our  arrival at Stapi; Hans now hired three Icelanders to take the place of  the horses--which could no longer carry our luggage. When, however,  these worthy islanders had reached the bottom of the crater, they were  to go back and leave us to ourselves. This point was settled before they  would agree to start.    On this occasion, my uncle partly confided in Hans, the eider-duck  hunter, and gave him to understand that it was his intention to continue  his exploration of the volcano to the last possible limits.    Hans listened calmly, and then nodded his head. To go there, or  elsewhere, to bury himself in the bowels of the earth, or to travel over  its summits, was all the same to him! As for me, amused and occupied by  the incidents of travel, I had begun to forget the inevitable future;  but now I was once more destined to realize the actual state of affairs.  What was to be done? Run away? But if I really had intended to leave  Professor Hardwigg to his fate, it should have been at Hamburg and not  at the foot of Sneffels.    One idea, above all others, began to trouble me: a very terrible idea,  and one calculated to shake the nerves of a man even less sensitive than  myself.    \"Let us consider the matter,\" I said to myself; \"we are going to ascend  the Sneffels mountain. Well and good. We are about to pay a visit to the  very bottom of the crater. Good, still. Others have done it and did not  perish from that course.    \"That, however, is not the whole matter to be considered. If a road does  really present itself by which to descend into the dark and  subterraneous bowels of Mother Earth, if this thrice unhappy Saknussemm  has really told the truth, we shall be most certainly lost in the midst  of the labyrinth of subterraneous galleries of the volcano. Now, we have  no evidence to prove that Sneffels is really extinct. What proof have we  that an eruption is not shortly about to take place? Because the monster  has slept soundly since 1219, does it follow that he is never to wake?    \"If he does wake what is to become of us?\"    These were questions worth thinking about, and upon them I reflected  long and deeply. I could not lie down in search of sleep without  dreaming of eruptions. The more I thought, the more I objected to be  reduced to the state of dross and ashes.    I could stand it no longer; so I determined at last to submit the whole  case to my uncle, in the most adroit manner possible, and under the form  of some totally irreconcilable hypothesis.    I sought him. I laid before him my fears, and then drew back in order to  let him get his passion over at his ease.    \"I have been thinking about the matter,\" he said, in the quietest tone  in the world.    What did he mean? Was he at last about to listen to the voice of reason?  Did he think of suspending his projects? It was almost too much  happiness to be true.    I however made no remark. In fact, I was only too anxious not to  interrupt him, and allowed him to reflect at his leisure. After some  moments he spoke out.    \"I have been thinking about the matter,\" he resumed. \"Ever since we have  been at Stapi, my mind has been almost solely occupied with the grave  question which has been submitted to me by yourself--for nothing would  be unwiser and more inconsistent than to act with imprudence.\"    \"I heartily agree with you, my dear uncle,\" was my somewhat hopeful  rejoinder.    \"It is now six hundred years since Sneffels has spoken, but though now  reduced to a state of utter silence, he may speak again. New volcanic  eruptions are always preceded by perfectly well-known phenomena. I have  closely examined the inhabitants of this region; I have carefully  studied the soil, and I beg to tell you emphatically, my dear Harry,  there will be no eruption at present.\"    As I listened to his positive affirmations, I was stupefied and could  say nothing.    \"I see you doubt my word,\" said my uncle; \"follow me.\"    I obeyed mechanically.    Leaving the presbytery, the Professor took a road through an opening in  the basaltic rock, which led far away from the sea. We were soon in open  country, if we could give such a name to a place all covered with  volcanic deposits. The whole land seemed crushed under the weight of  enormous stones--of trap, of basalt, of granite, of lava, and of all  other volcanic substances.    I could see many spouts of steam rising in the air. These white vapors,  called in the Icelandic language \"reykir,\" come from hot water  fountains, and indicate by their violence the volcanic activity of the  soil. Now the sight of these appeared to justify my apprehension. I was,  therefore, all the more surprised and mortified when my uncle thus  addressed me.    \"You see all this smoke, Harry, my boy?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, as long as you see them thus, you have nothing to fear from the  volcano.\"    \"How can that be?\"    \"Be careful to remember this,\" continued the Professor. \"At the approach  of an eruption these spouts of vapor redouble their activity--to  disappear altogether during the period of volcanic eruption; for the  elastic fluids, no longer having the necessary tension, seek refuge in  the interior of the crater, instead of escaping through the fissures of  the earth. If, then, the steam remains in its normal or habitual state,  if their energy does not increase, and if you add to this, the remark  that the wind is not replaced by heavy atmospheric pressure and dead  calm, you may be quite sure that there is no fear of any immediate  eruption.\"    \"But--\"    \"Enough, my boy. When science has sent forth her fiat--it is only to  hear and obey.\"    I came back to the house quite downcast and disappointed. My uncle had  completely defeated me with his scientific arguments. Nevertheless, I  had still one hope, and that was, when once we were at the bottom of the  crater, that it would be impossible in default of a gallery or tunnel,  to descend any deeper; and this, despite all the learned Saknussemms in  the world.    I passed the whole of the following night with a nightmare on my chest!  and, after unheard-of miseries and tortures, found myself in the very  depths of the earth, from which I was suddenly launched into planetary  space, under the form of an eruptive rock!    Next day, June 23d, Hans calmly awaited us outside the presbytery with  his three companions loaded with provisions, tools, and instruments. Two  iron-shod poles, two guns, and two large game bags, were reserved for my  uncle and myself. Hans, who was a man who never forgot even the minutest  precautions, had added to our baggage a large skin full of water, as an  addition to our gourds. This assured us water for eight days.    It was nine o'clock in the morning when we were quite ready. The rector  and his huge wife or servant, I never knew which, stood at the door to  see us off. They appeared to be about to inflict on us the usual final  kiss of the Icelanders. To our supreme astonishment their adieu took the  shape of a formidable bill, in which they even counted the use of the  pastoral house, really and truly the most abominable and dirty place I  ever was in. The worthy couple cheated and robbed us like a Swiss  innkeeper, and made us feel, by the sum we had to pay, the splendors of  their hospitality.    My uncle, however, paid without bargaining. A man who had made up his  mind to undertake a voyage into the Interior of the Earth, is not the  man to haggle over a few miserable rix-dollars.    This important matter settled, Hans gave the signal for departure, and  some few moments later we had left Stapi.          CHAPTER 12    THE ASCENT OF MOUNT SNEFFELS      The huge volcano which was the first stage of our daring experiment is  above five thousand feet high. Sneffels is the termination of a long  range of volcanic mountains, of a different character to the system of  the island itself. One of its peculiarities is its two huge pointed  summits. From whence we started it was impossible to make out the real  outlines of the peak against the grey field of sky. All we could  distinguish was a vast dome of white, which fell downwards from the head  of the giant.    The commencement of the great undertaking filled me with awe. Now that  we had actually started, I began to believe in the reality of the  undertaking!    Our party formed quite a procession. We walked in single file, preceded  by Hans, the imperturbable eider-duck hunter. He calmly led us by narrow  paths where two persons could by no possibility walk abreast.  Conversation was wholly impossible. We had all the more opportunity to  reflect and admire the awful grandeur of the scene around.    Beyond the extraordinary basaltic wall of the fjord of Stapi we found  ourselves making our way through fibrous turf, over which grew a scanty  vegetation of grass, the residuum of the ancient vegetation of the  swampy peninsula. The vast mass of this combustible, the field of which  as yet is utterly unexplored, would suffice to warm Iceland for a whole  century. This mighty turf pit, measured from the bottom of certain  ravines, is often not less than seventy feet deep, and presents to the  eye the view of successive layers of black burned-up rocky detritus,  separated by thin streaks of porous sandstone.    The grandeur of the spectacle was undoubted, as well as its arid and  deserted air.    As a true nephew of the great Professor Hardwigg, and despite my  preoccupation and doleful fears of what was to come, I observed with  great interest the vast collection of mineralogical curiosities spread  out before me in this vast museum of natural history. Looking back to my  recent studies, I went over in thought the whole geological history of  Iceland.    This extraordinary and curious island must have made its appearance from  out of the great world of waters at a comparatively recent date. Like  the coral islands of the"]]]
