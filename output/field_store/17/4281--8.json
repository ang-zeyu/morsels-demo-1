Let us, while we  feel so powerfully the nearness of the superearthly, unite our souls in  a tie which can never again be broken.  Whatever love may be, Marie, I  love you and I feel, Marie, you are mine for I am thine.\"    I knelt before her, but ventured not to look into her eyes.  My lips  touched her hand and I kissed it.  At this she withdrew her hand from  me, slowly at first and then quickly and decidedly, and as I looked at  her an expression of pain was on her face.  She was silent for a time,  but at last she raised herself and said with a deep sigh:    \"Enough for to-day.  You have caused me pain, but it is my fault.  Close the window.  I feel a cold chill coming over me as if a strange  hand were touching me.  Stay with me--but no, you must go.  Farewell!  Sleep well!  Pray that the peace of God may abide with us.  We see each  other again--shall we not?  To-morrow evening I await you.\"    Oh, where all at once had this heavenly rest flown?  I saw how she  suffered, and all that, I could do was to quickly hurry away, summon  the English lady and then go alone in the darkness of night to the  village.  Long time I wandered back and forth about the lake, long my  gaze strayed to the lighted window where I had just been.  Finally, the  last light in the castle was extinguished.  The moon mounted higher and  higher, and every pinnacle and projection and decoration on the lofty  walls grew visible in the fairy-like illumination.  Here was I all  alone in the silent night.  It seemed to me my brain had refused its  office, for no thought came to an end and I only felt I was alone on  this earth, that it contained no soul for me.  The earth was like a  coffin, the black sky a funeral pall, and I scarcely knew whether I was  living or had long been dead.  Then I suddenly looked up to the stars  with their blinking eyes, which went their way so quietly--and it  seemed to me that they were only for the lighting and consolation of  men, and then I thought of two heavenly stars which had risen in my  dark heaven so unexpectedly, and a thanksgiving rang through my  breast--a thanksgiving for the love of my angel.          LAST MEMORY.    The sun was already looking into my window over the mountains when I  awoke.  Was it the same sun which looked upon us the evening before with  lingering gaze, like a departing friend, as if it would bless the union  of our souls, and which set like a lost hope?  It shone upon me now, like  a child which bursts into our room with beaming glance to wish us good  morning on a joyful holiday.  And was I the same man who, only a few  hours before, had thrown himself upon his bed, broken in body and spirit?  Immediately I felt once more the old life-courage and trust in God and  myself, which quickened and animated my soul like the fresh morning,  breeze.  What would become of man without sleep?  We know not where this  nightly messenger leads us; and when he closes our eyes at night who can  assure us that he will open them again in the morning--that he will bring  us to ourselves?  It required courage and faith for the first man to  throw himself into the arms of this unknown friend; and were there not in  our nature a certain helplessness which forces us to submission, and  compels us to have faith in all things we are to believe, I doubt whether  any man, notwithstanding all his weariness, could close his eyes of his  own free will and enter into this unknown dream-land.  The very  consciousness of our weakness and our weariness gives us faith in a  higher power, and courage to resign ourselves to the beautiful system of  the All, and we feel invigorated and refreshed when, in waking or in  sleeping, we have loosened, even for a short time only, the chains which  bind our Eternal Self to our temporal Ego.    What had appeared to me, only yesterday, dark as an evening cloud flying  overhead, became instantly clear.  We belonged to one another, that I  felt; be it as brother and sister, father and child, bridegroom and  bride, we must remain together now and forever.  It only concerned us to  find the right name for that which we in our stammering speech call Love.      \"Thy elder brother I would be,    Thy father--anything to thee.\"    It was this \"anything\" for which a name must be found, for the world now  recognizes nothing as nameless.  She had told me herself that she loved  me with that pure all-human love, out of which springs all other love.  Her shuddering, her uneasiness, when I confessed my full love to her,  were still incomprehensible to me, but it could no longer shatter my  faith in our love.  Why should we desire to understand all that takes  place in other human natures, when there is so much that is  incomprehensible in our own?  After all, it is the inconceivable which  generally captivates us, whether in nature, in man, or in our own  breasts.  Men whom we understand, whose motives we see before us like an  anatomical preparation, leave us cold, like the characters in most of our  novels.  Nothing spoils our delight in life and men more than this ethic  rationalism which insists upon clearing up everything, and illuminating  every mystery of our inner being.  There is in every person a something  that is inseparable--we call it fate, the suggestive power or  character--and he knows neither himself nor mankind, who believes that he  can analyze the deeds and actions of men without taking into account this  ever-recurring principle.  Thus I consoled myself on all those points  which had troubled me in the evening; and at last no streak of cloud  obscured the heaven of the future.    In this frame of mind I stepped out of the close house into the open air,  when a messenger brought a letter for me.  It was from the Countess, as I  saw by the beautiful, delicate handwriting.  I breathlessly opened it--I  looked for the most blissful tidings man can expect.  But all my hopes  were immediately shattered.  The letter contained only a request not to  visit her to-day, as she expected a visit at the castle from the Court  Residence.  No friendly word--no news of her health--only at the close, a  postscript: \"The Hofrath will be here to-morrow and the next day.\"    Here were two days torn out at once from the book of life.  If they could  only be completely obliterated--but no, they hang over me like the leaden  roof of a prison.  They must be lived.  I could not give them away as a  charity to king or beggar, who would gladly have sat two days longer upon  his throne, or on his stone at the church door.  I remained in this  abstraction for a long time; but then I thought of my morning prayer, and  how I said to myself there was no greater unbelief than despondency--how  the smallest and greatest in life are part of one great divine plan, to  which we must submit, however hard it may be.  Like a rider who sees a  precipice before him, I drew in the reins.  \"Be it so, since it must be!\"  I cried out; \"but God's earth is not the place for complaints and  lamentations.  Is it not a happiness to hold in my hand these lines which  she has written? and is not the hope of seeing her again in a short time  a greater bliss than I have ever deserved?  'Always keep the head above  water,' say all good life-swimmers.  As well sink at once as allow the  water to run into your eyes and throat.\"  If it is hard for us, amid  these little ills of life, to keep God's providence continually in view,  and if we hesitate, perhaps rightly, in every struggle, to step out of  the common-places of life into the presence of the divine, then life  ought to appear, to us at least, an art, if not a duty.  What is more  disagreeable than the child who behaves ungovernably and grows dejected  and angry at every little loss and pain?  On the other hand, nothing is  more beautiful than the child in whose tearful eyes the sunshine of joy  and innocence soon beams again, like the flower, which quivers and  trembles in the spring shower, and soon after blossoms and exhales its  fragrance, as the sun dries the tears upon its cheeks.    A good thought speedily occurred to me, that I could live both these days  with her, notwithstanding fate.  For a long time I had intended to write  down the dear words she had said, and the many beautiful thoughts she had  confided to me; and so the days passed away in memory of the many  charming hours spent, together, and in the hope of a still more beautiful  future, and I was by her and with her, and lived in her, and felt the  nearness of her spirit and her love more than I had ever felt them when I  held her hand in mine.    How dear to me now are these leaves!  How often have I read and re-read  them--not that I had forgotten one word she said, but they were the  witnesses of my happiness, and something looked out of them upon me like  the gaze of a friend, whose silence speaks more than words.  The memory  of a past happiness, the memory of a past sorrow, the silent meditation  upon the past, when everything disappears that surrounds and restrains  us, when the soul throws itself down, like a mother upon the green  grave-mound of her child who has slept under it many long years, when no  hope, no desire, disturbs the silence of peaceful resignation, we may  well call sadness, but there is a rapture in this sadness which only  those know who have loved and suffered much.  Ask the mother what she  feels when she ties upon the head of her daughter the veil _she_ once  wore as a bride, and thinks of the husband no longer with her!  Ask a man  what he feels when the maiden whom he has loved, and the world has torn  from him, sends him after death the dried rose which he gave her in  youth!  They may both weep, but their tears are not tears of sorrow, but  tears of joy; tears of sacrifice, with which man consecrates himself to  the Divine, and with faith in God's love and wisdom, looks"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#12)"],[1,"he had resolved to do,  viz., \"to cover with thick infamy all who were concerned in this  nefarious business,\" the captain as well as the owner of the  ill-freighted ship. He did literally point at these men the finger of  scorn. Every device known to the printer's art for concentrating the  reader's attention upon particular words and sentences, Garrison made  skillful use of in his articles--from the deep damnation of the heavy  black capitals in which he printed the name Francis Todd, to the small  caps in which appeared the words, \"sentenced to solitary confinement for  life,\" and which he flanked with two terrible indices. But the articles  did not need such embellishment. They were red hot branding irons  without them. One can almost smell the odor of burning flesh as he reads  the words: \"It is no worse to fit out piratical cruisers or to engage in  the foreign slave-trade, than to pursue a similar trade along our coast;  and the men who have the wickedness to participate therein, for the  purpose of keeping up wealth should be ==>SENTENCED TO SOLITARY  CONFINEMENT FOR LIFE; <==_they are the enemies of their own  species--highway robbers, and murderers_; and their final doom will be,  unless they speedily repent, _to occupy the lowest depths of perdition_.  I know that our laws make a distinction in this matter. I know that the  man who is allowed to freight his vessel with slaves at home, for a  distant market, would be thought worthy of death if he should take a  similar freight on the coast of Africa; but I know, too, that this  distinction is absurd, and at war with the common sense of mankind, and  that God and good men regard it with abhorrence.    \"I recollect that it was always a mystery in Newburyport how Mr. Todd  contrived to make profitable voyages to New Orleans and other places,  when other merchants, with as fair an opportunity to make money, and  sending to the same ports at the same time invariably made fewer  successful speculations. The mystery seems to be unravelled. Any man can  gather up riches if he does not care by what means they are obtained.\"    A copy of the _Genius_, containing this article Garrison sent to the  owner of the ship _Francis_. What followed made it immediately manifest  that the branding irons of the reformer had burned home with scarifying  effect. Mr. Todd's answer to the strictures was a suit at law against  the editors of the _Genius_ for five thousand dollars in damages. But  this was not all. The Grand Jury for Baltimore indicted them for  publishing \"a gross and malicious libel against Francis Todd and  Nicholas Brown.\" This was at the February Term, 1830. On the first day  of March following, Garrison was tried. He was ably and eloquently  defended by Charles Mitchell, a young lawyer of the Baltimore Bar. But  the prejudice of judge and jury rendered the verdict of guilty a  foregone conclusion. April 17, 1830, the Court imposed a penalty of  fifty dollars and costs, which, with the fine amounted in all to nearly  one hundred dollars. The fine and costs Garrison could not pay, and he  was therefore committed to jail as a common malefactor. His confinement  lasted seven weeks. He did not languish during this period. His head and  hands were in fact hardly ever more active than during the term of his  imprisonment. Shut out by Maryland justice from work without the jail,  he found and did that which needed to be done within \"high walls and  huge.\" He was an extraordinary prisoner and was treated with  extraordinary consideration by the Warden. He proved himself a genuine  evangel to the prisoners, visiting them in their cells, cheering them by  his bouyant and benevolent words, giving them what he had, a brother's  sympathy, which to these ill-fated ones, was more than gold or silver.  He indited for such of them as he deemed deserving, letters and  petitions to the Governor praying their pardon; and he had the great  satisfaction of seeing many of his efforts in this regard crowned with  success.    But more than this his imprisonment afforded him an opportunity for a  closer acquaintance with the barbarism of slavery than he could possibly  have made had he lived otherwise in Baltimore. A Southern jail was not  only the place of detention of offenders against social justice, but of  slaves waiting for the next market-day, of recaptured fugitives waiting  for their owners to reclaim them. Here they were huddled and caged,  pitiful and despairing in their misery. Such scenes sickened the young  reformer every day. God had opened to him the darkest chapter in the  book of the negroes' wrongs. Here is a page from that black volume of  oppression and cruelty, the record of which he has preserved in the  following graphic narrative: \"During my late incarceration in Baltimore  prison, four men came to obtain a runaway slave. He was brought out of  his cell to confront his master, but pretended not to know him--did not  know that he had ever seen him before--could not recollect his name. Of  course the master was exceedingly irritated. 'Don't you remember,' said  he, 'when I gave you not long since thirty-nine lashes under the  apple-tree? Another time when I gave you a sound flogging in the barn?  Another time when you was scourged for giving me the lie, by saying that  the horse was in a good condition?' 'Yes,' replied the slave, whose  memory was thus quickened, 'I do recollect. You have beaten me cruelly  without cause; you have not given me enough to eat and drink; and I  don't want to go back again. I wish you to sell me to another master. I  had rather even go to Georgia than to return home!'    \"'I'll let you know, you villain,' said the master, 'that my wishes and  not _yours_, are to be consulted. I'll learn you how to run away  again.'\"    The other men advised him to take the black home, and cut him up in inch  pieces for his impudence, obstinacy, and desertion--swearing  tremendously all the while. The slave was ordered back to his cell. Then  ensued the following colloquy between Garrison and the master:    G.--\"Sir, what right have you to that poor creature?\"    M.--\"My father left him to me.\"    G.--\"Suppose your father had broken into a bank and stolen ten thousand  dollars, and safely bequeathed that as a legacy; could you  conscientiously keep the money? For myself, I had rather rob any bank to  an indefinite amount than kidnap a fellow-being, or hold him in bondage;  the sin would be less injurious to society, and less sinful in the sight  of God.\"    M.--\"Perhaps you would like to buy the slave and give him his liberty?\"    G.--\"Sir, I am a poor man; and were I ever so opulent, it would be  necessary, on your part, to make out a clear title to the services of  the slave before I could conscientiously make a bargain.\"    M--\"Well, sir, I can prove from the Bible that slavery is right.\"    G.--\"Ah! that is a precious book--the rule of conduct. I have always  supposed that its spirit was directly opposed to everything in the shape  of fraud and oppression. However, sir, I should be glad to hear your  text.\"    M. (hesitatingly)--\"Ham--Noah's curse, you know.\"    G. (hastily)--\"Oh, sir, you build on a very slender foundation. Granting  even--what remains to be proved--that the Africans are the descendants  of Ham, Noah's curse was a _prediction_ of future servitude, and not an  injunction to oppress. Pray, sir, is it a careful desire to fulfill the  Scriptures, or to make money, that induces you to hold your fellow-men  in bondage?\"    M. (excitedly)--\"Why, sir, do you really think that the slaves are  beings like ourselves?--that is, I mean do you believe that they possess  the same faculties and capacities as the whites?\"    G. (energetically)--\"Certainly, sir, I do not know that there is any  moral or intellectual quality in the curl of the hair, or the color of  the skin. I cannot conceive why a black man may not as reasonably object  to my color, as I to his. Sir, it is not a black face that I detest, but  a black heart--and I find it very often under a white skin.\"    M. (derisively)--\"Well, sir, how should you like to see a black man  President of the United States?\"    G. (severely)--\"As to that, sir, I am a true Republican, and bow to the  will of the majority. If the people prefer a black President, I should  cheerfully submit; and if he be qualified for the station, may  peradventure give him my vote.\"    M. (triumphantly)--\"How should you like to have a black man marry your  daughter?\"    G. (making a home thrust and an end of the dialogue)--\"I am not  married--I have no daughter. Sir, I am not familiar with _your_  practices; but allow me to say, that slaveholders generally should be  the last persons to affect fastidiousness on that point; for they seem  to be enamored with _amalgamation_.\"    Garrison's pen was particularly busy during the term of his  imprisonment. He paid his respects to the State's Attorney who  prosecuted him, to the judge who condemned him, and to Francis Todd, the  owner of the ship _Francis_. He prepared and scattered broadcast a true  account of his trial, showing how the liberty of the press had been  violated in the case. He did not doubt that it would astonish Europe if  it were known there \"that _an American citizen lies incarcerated in  prison, for having denounced slavery and its abettors in his own  country_.\" The fact created no little astonishment in America. Slavery  became distinctly connected for the first time with abridgments of the  freedom of the press, and the right of free speech. And the cause of the  slave became involved with the Constitutional liberties of the republic.  In punishing Garrison, the Abolitionist, the rights of Garrison the  white freeman were trampled on. And white freemen in the North, who  cared nothing for Abolitionism, but a great deal for their right to  speak and write freely, resented the outrage. This fact was the most  important consequence, which"]]]
