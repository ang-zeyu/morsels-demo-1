Gascoyne had, as I said, entered into the matter with spirit, and  perhaps it was owing more to him than to any other that the project  caught its delightful flavor of romance.    \"Perchance,\" said he, as the five lads lay in the rustling stillness  through which sounded the monotonous and ceaseless cooing of the  pigeons--\"perchance there may be dwarfs and giants and dragons and  enchanters and evil knights and what not even nowadays. And who knows  but that if we Knights of the Rose hold together we may go forth into  the world, and do battle with them, and save beautiful ladies, and  have tales and gestes written about us as they are writ about the Seven  Champions and Arthur his Round-table.\"    Perhaps Myles, who lay silently listening to all that was said, was the  only one who looked upon the scheme at all in the light of real utility,  but I think that even with him the fun of the matter outweighed the  serious part of the business.    So it was that the Sacred Order of the Twenty Knights of the Rose  came to be initiated. They appointed a code of secret passwords and  countersigns which were very difficult to remember, and which were only  used when they might excite the curiosity of the other and uninitiated  boys by their mysterious sound. They elected Myles as their Grand High  Commander, and held secret meetings in the ancient tower, where many  mysteries were soberly enacted.    Of course in a day or two all the body of squires knew nearly everything  concerning the Knights of the Rose, and of their secret meetings in  the old tower. The lucky twenty were the objects of envy of all not so  fortunate as to be included in this number, and there was a marked air  of secrecy about everything they did that appealed to every romantic  notion of the youngsters looking on. What was the stormy outcome of it  all is now presently to be told.        CHAPTER 12    Thus it was that Myles, with an eye to open war with the bachelors,  gathered a following to his support. It was some little while before  matters were brought to a crisis--a week or ten days. Perhaps even Myles  had no great desire to hasten matters. He knew that whenever war was  declared, he himself would have to bear the brunt of the battle, and  even the bravest man hesitates before deliberately thrusting himself  into a fight.    One morning Myles and Gascoyne and Wilkes sat under the shade of two  trees, between which was a board nailed to the trunks, making a rude  bench--always a favorite lounging-place for the lads in idle moments.  Myles was polishing his bascinet with lard and wood-ashes, rubbing the  metal with a piece of leather, and wiping it clean with a fustian rag.  The other two, who had just been relieved from household duty, lay at  length idly looking on.    Just then one of the smaller pages, a boy of twelve or thirteen, by name  Robin Ingoldsby, crossed the court. He had been crying; his face was red  and blubbered, and his body was still shaken with convulsive sniffs.    Myles looked up. \"Come hither, Robin,\" he called from where he sat.  \"What is to do?\"    The little fellow came slowly up to where the three rested in the shade.  \"Mowbray beat me with a strap,\" said he, rubbing his sleeve across his  eyes, and catching his breath at the recollection.    \"Beat thee, didst say?\" said Myles, drawing his brows together. \"Why did  he beat thee?\"    \"Because,\" said Robin, \"I tarried overlong in fetching a pot of beer  from the buttery for him and Wyatt.\" Then, with a boy's sudden and easy  quickness in forgetting past troubles, \"Tell me, Falworth,\" said he,  \"when wilt thou give me that knife thou promised me--the one thou break  the blade of yesterday?\"    \"I know not,\" said Myles, bluntly, vexed that the boy did not take  the disgrace of his beating more to heart. \"Some time soon, mayhap. Me  thinks thou shouldst think more of thy beating than of a broken knife.  Now get thee gone to thy business.\"    The youngster lingered for a moment or two watching Myles at his work.  \"What is that on the leather scrap, Falworth?\" said he, curiously.    \"Lard and ashes,\" said Myles, testily. \"Get thee gone, I say, or I  will crack thy head for thee;\" and he picked up a block of wood, with a  threatening gesture.    The youngster made a hideous grimace, and then scurried away, ducking  his head, lest in spite of Myles's well-known good-nature the block  should come whizzing after him.    \"Hear ye that now!\" cried Myles, flinging down the block again and  turning to his two friends. \"Beaten with straps because, forsooth, he  would not fetch and carry quickly enough to please the haste of these  bachelors. Oh, this passeth patience, and I for one will bear it no  longer.\"    \"Nay, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, soothingly, \"the little imp is as lazy as a  dormouse and as mischievous as a monkey. I'll warrant the hiding was his  due, and that more of the like would do him good.\"    \"Why, how dost thou talk, Francis!\" said Myles, turning upon him  indignantly. \"Thou knowest that thou likest to see the boy beaten no  more than I.\" Then, after a meditative pause, \"How many, think ye, we  muster of our company of the Rose today?\"    Wilkes looked doubtfully at Gascoyne. \"There be only seventeen of us  here now,\" said he at last. \"Brinton and Lambourne are away to Roby  Castle in Lord George's train, and will not be back till Saturday next.  And Watt Newton is in the infirmary.    \"Seventeen be'st enou,\" said Myles, grimly. \"Let us get together this  afternoon, such as may, in the Brutus Tower, for I, as I did say, will  no longer suffer these vile bachelors.\"    Gascoyne and Wilkes exchanged looks, and then the former blew a long  whistle.    So that afternoon a gloomy set of young faces were gathered together in  the Eyry--fifteen of the Knights of the Rose--and all knew why they were  assembled. The talk which followed was conducted mostly by Myles. He  addressed the others with a straightforward vim and earnestness, but the  response was only half-hearted, and when at last, having heated himself  up with his own fire, he sat down, puffing out his red cheeks and  glaring round, a space of silence followed, the lads looked doubtfully  at one another. Myles felt the chill of their silence strike coldly on  his enthusiasm, and it vexed him.    \"What wouldst thou do, Falworth?\" said one of the knights, at last.  \"Wouldst have us open a quarrel with the bachelors?\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles, gruffly. \"I had thought that ye would all lend me a  hand in a pitched battle but now I see that ye ha' no stomach for that.  Ne'theless, I tell ye plainly I will not submit longer to the bachelors.  So now I will ask ye not to take any venture upon yourselves, but only  this: that ye will stand by me when I do my fighting, and not let five  or seven of them fall upon me at once.    \"There is Walter Blunt; he is parlous strong,\" said one of the others,  after a time of silence. \"Methinks he could conquer any two of us.\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles; \"ye do fear him too greatly. I tell ye I fear not to  stand up to try battle with him and will do so, too, if the need arise.  Only say ye that ye will stand by my back.\"    \"Marry,\" said Gascoyne, quaintly, \"an thou wilt dare take the heavy end  upon thee, I for one am willing to stand by and see that thou have thy  fill of fighting.\"    \"I too will stand thee by, Myles,\" said Edmund Wilkes.    \"And I, and I, and I,\" said others, chiming in.    Those who would still have held back were carried along by the stream,  and so it was settled that if the need should arise for Myles to do  a bit of fighting, the others should stand by to see that he had fair  play.    \"When thinkest thou that thou wilt take thy stand against them, Myles?\"  asked Wilkes.    Myles hesitated a moment. \"To-morrow,\" said he, grimly.    Several of the lads whistled softly.    Gascoyne was prepared for an early opening of the war, but perhaps not  for such an early opening as this. \"By 'r Lady, Myles, thou art hungry  for brawling,\" said he.        CHAPTER 13    After the first excitement of meeting, discussing, and deciding had  passed, Myles began to feel the weight of the load he had so boldly  taken upon himself. He began to reckon what a serious thing it was for  him to stand as a single champion against the tyranny that had grown  so strong through years of custom. Had he let himself do so, he might  almost have repented, but it was too late now for repentance. He had  laid his hand to the plough, and he must drive the furrow.    Somehow the news of impending battle had leaked out among the rest of  the body of squires, and a buzz of suppressed excitement hummed through  the dormitory that evening. The bachelors, to whom, no doubt, vague  rumors had been blown, looked lowering, and talked together in low  voices, standing apart in a group. Some of them made a rather marked  show of secreting knives in the straw of their beds, and no doubt it had  its effect upon more than one young heart that secretly thrilled at the  sight of the shining blades. However, all was undisturbed that evening.  The lights were put out, and the lads retired with more than usual  quietness, only for the murmur of whispering.    All night Myles's sleep was more or less disturbed by dreams in which he  was now conquering, now being conquered, and before the day had fairly  broken he was awake. He lay upon his cot, keying himself up for the  encounter which he had set upon himself to face, and it would not be  the truth to say that the sight of those knives hidden in the straw  the night before had made no impression upon him. By-and-by he knew the  others were beginning to awake, for he heard them softly stirring, and  as the light grew broad and strong, saw them arise, one by one, and  begin dressing in the gray morning.

Anyway, I followed them, close in the shadow.    Wright was unusually gay. I saw him put his arm around her without  remonstrance. When the music recommenced they went back to the house.  Wright danced with Sally, not ungracefully for a man who rode a horse as  much as he. After the dance he waved aside Sally's many partners, not so  gaily as would have been consistent with good feeling, and led her away.  I followed. They ended up that walk at the extreme corner of the patio,  where, under gaily colored lights, a little arbor had been made among  the flowers and vines.    Sally seemed to have lost something of her vivacity. They had not been  out of my sight for a moment before Sally cried out. It was a cry of  impatience or remonstrance, rather than alarm, but I decided that it  would serve me an excuse.    I dashed back, leaped to the door of the arbor, my hand on my gun.    Wright was holding Sally. When he heard me he let her go. Then she  uttered a cry that was one of alarm. Her face blanched; her eyes grew  strained. One hand went to her breast. She thought I meant to kill  Wright.    \"Excuse me,\" I burst out frankly, turning to Wright. I never saw a  hyena, but he looked like one. \"I heard a squeal. Thought a girl was  hurt, or something. Miss Sampson gave me orders to watch out for  accidents, fire, anything. So excuse me, Wright.\"    As I stepped back, to my amazement, Sally, excusing herself to the  scowling Wright, hurriedly joined me.    \"Oh, it's our dance, Russ!\"    She took my arm and we walked through the patio.    \"I'm afraid of him, Russ,\" she whispered. \"You frightened me worse  though. You didn't mean to--to--\"    \"I made a bluff. Saw he'd been drinking, so I kept near you.\"    \"You return good for evil,\" she replied, squeezing my arm. \"Russ, let me  tell you--whenever anything frightens me since we got here I think of  you. If you're only near I feel safe.\"    We paused at the door leading into the big parlor. Couples were passing.  Here I could scarcely distinguish the last words she said. She stood  before me, eyes downcast, face flushed, as sweet and pretty a lass as  man could want to see, and with her hand she twisted round and round a  silver button on my buckskin vest.    \"Dance with me, the rest of this,\" she said. \"George shooed away my  partner. I'm glad for the chance. Dance with me, Russ--not gallantly or  dutifully because I ask you, but because you _want_ to. Else not at  all.\"    There was a limit to my endurance. There would hardly be another evening  like this, at least, for me, in that country. I capitulated with what  grace I could express.    We went into the parlor, and as we joined the dancers, despite all that  confusion I heard her whisper: \"I've been a little beast to you.\"    That dance seemingly lasted only a moment--a moment while she was all  airy grace, radiant, and alluring, floating close to me, with our hands  clasped. Then it appeared the music had ceased, the couples were finding  seats, and Sally and I were accosted by Miss Sampson.    She said we made a graceful couple in the dance. And Sally said she did  not have to reach up a mile to me--I was not so awfully tall.    And I, tongue-tied for once, said nothing.    Wright had returned and was now standing, cigarette between lips, in the  door leading out to the patio. At the same moment that I heard a heavy  tramp of boots, from the porch side I saw Wright's face change  remarkably, expressing amaze, consternation, then fear.    I wheeled in time to see Vaughn Steele bend his head to enter the door  on that side. The dancers fell back.    At sight of him I was again the Ranger, his ally. Steele was pale, yet  heated. He panted. He wore no hat. He had his coat turned up and with  left hand he held the lapels together.    In a quick ensuing silence Miss Sampson rose, white as her dress. The  young women present stared in astonishment and their partners showed  excitement.    \"Miss Sampson, I came to search your house!\" panted Steele, courteously,  yet with authority.    I disengaged myself from Sally, who was clinging to my hands, and I  stepped forward out of the corner. Steele had been running. Why did he  hold his coat like that? I sensed action, and the cold thrill animated  me.    Miss Sampson's astonishment was succeeded by anger difficult to control.    \"In the absence of my father I am mistress here. I will not permit you  to search my house.\"    \"Then I regret to say I must do so without your permission,\" he said  sternly.    \"Do not dare!\" she flashed. She stood erect, her bosom swelling, her  eyes magnificently black with passion. \"How dare you intrude here? Have  you not insulted us enough? To search my house to-night--to break up my  party--oh, it's worse than outrage! Why on earth do you want to search  here? Ah, for the same reason you dragged a poor innocent man into my  father's court! Sir, I forbid you to take another step into this house.\"    Steele's face was bloodless now, and I wondered if it had to do with her  scathing scorn or something that he hid with his hand closing his coat  that way.    \"Miss Sampson, I don't need warrants to search houses,\" he said. \"But  this time I'll respect your command. It would be too bad to spoil your  party. Let me add, perhaps you do me a little wrong. God knows I hope  so. I was shot by a rustler. He fled. I chased him here. He has taken  refuge here--in your father's house. He's hidden somewhere.\"    Steele spread wide his coat lapels. He wore a light shirt, the color of  which in places was white. The rest was all a bloody mass from which  dark red drops fell to the floor.    \"Oh!\" cried Miss Sampson.    Scorn and passion vanished in the horror, the pity, of a woman who  imagined she saw a man mortally wounded. It was a hard sight for a  woman's eyes, that crimson, heaving breast.    \"Surely I didn't see that,\" went on Steele, closing his coat. \"You used  unforgettable words, Miss Sampson. From you they hurt. For I stand  alone. My fight is to make Linrock safer, cleaner, a better home for  women and children. Some day you will remember what you said.\"    How splendid he looked, how strong against odds. How simple a dignity  fitted his words. Why, a woman far blinder than Diane Sampson could have  seen that here stood a man.    Steele bowed, turned on his heel, and strode out to vanish in the dark.    Then while she stood bewildered, still shocked, I elected to do some  rapid thinking.    How seriously was Steele injured? An instant's thought was enough to  tell me that if he had sustained any more than a flesh wound he would  not have chased his assailant, not with so much at stake in the future.    Then I concerned myself with a cold grip of desire to get near the  rustler who had wounded Steele. As I started forward, however, Miss  Sampson defeated me. Sally once more clung to my hands, and directly we  were surrounded by an excited circle.    It took a moment or two to calm them.    \"Then there's a rustler--here--hiding?\" repeated Miss Sampson.    \"Miss Sampson, I'll find him. I'll rout him out,\" I said.    \"Yes, yes, find him, Russ, but don't use violence,\" she replied. \"Send  him away--no, give him over to--\"    \"Nothing of the kind,\" interrupted George Wright, loud-voiced. \"Cousin,  go on with your dance. I'll take a couple of cowboys. I'll find  this--this rustler, if there's one here. But I think it's only another  bluff of Steele's.\"    This from Wright angered me deeply, and I strode right for the door.    \"Where are you going?\" he demanded.    \"I've Miss Sampson's orders. She wants me to find this hidden man. She  trusts me not to allow any violence.\"    \"Didn't I say I'd see to that?\" he snarled.    \"Wright, I don't care what you say,\" I retorted. \"But I'm thinking you  might not want me to find this rustler.\"    Wright turned black in the face. Verily, if he had worn a gun he would  have pulled it on me. As it was, Miss Sampson's interference probably  prevented more words, if no worse.    \"Don't quarrel,\" she said. \"George, you go with Russ. Please hurry. I'll  be nervous till the rustler's found or you're sure there's not one.\"    We started with several cowboys to ransack the house. We went through  the rooms, searching, calling out, flashing our lanterns in dark places.    It struck me forcibly that Wright did all the calling. He hurried, too,  tried to keep in the lead. I wondered if he knew his voice would be  recognized by the hiding man.    Be that as it might, it was I who peered into a dark corner, and then  with a cocked gun leveled I said: \"Come out!\"    He came forth into the flare of lanterns, a tall, slim, dark-faced  youth, wearing dark sombrero, blouse and trousers. I collared him before  any of the others could move, and I held the gun close enough to make  him shrink.    But he did not impress me as being frightened just then; nevertheless,  he had a clammy face, the pallid look of a man who had just gotten over  a shock. He peered into my face, then into that of the cowboy next to  me, then into Wright's and if ever in my life I beheld relief I saw it  then.    That was all I needed to know, but I meant to find out more if I could.    \"Who're you?\" I asked quietly.    He gazed rather arrogantly down at me. It always irritated me to be  looked down at that way.    \"Say, don't be gay with me or you'll get it good,\" I yelled, prodding  him in the side with the cocked gun. \"Who are you? Quick!\"    \"Bo Snecker,\" he said.    \"Any relation to Bill Snecker?\"    \"His son.\"    \"What'd you hide here for?\"    He appeared to grow sullen.    \"Reckoned I'd be as safe in Sampson's as anywheres.\"    \"Ahuh! You're taking a long chance,\" I replied, and he never knew, or  any of the others, just how long a chance that was.    Sight of Steele's bloody breast remained with me, and I had something  sinister to combat. This was no time for me to"]]]
