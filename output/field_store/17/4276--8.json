Was that thy nose, friend, I had hold of?    _Brander_ [_to Siebel_]. And I have thine, too, in my hand!    _Altmayer_. O what a shock! through all my limbs 'tis crawling!  Get me a chair, be quick, I'm falling!    _Frosch_. No, say what was the real case?    _Siebel_. O show me where the churl is hiding!  Alive he shall not leave the place!    _Altmayer_. Out through the cellar-door I saw him riding--  Upon a cask--he went full chase.--  Heavy as lead my feet are growing.          [_Turning towards the table_.]    My! If the wine should yet be flowing.    _Siebel_. 'Twas all deception and moonshine.    _Frosch_. Yet I was sure I did drink wine.    _Brander_. But how about the bunches, brother?    _Altmayer_. After such miracles, I'll doubt no other!               WITCHES' KITCHEN.         [_On a low hearth stands a great kettle over the fire. In the smoke,  which rises from it, are seen various forms. A female monkey[28] sits by  the kettle and skims it, and takes care that it does not run over. The  male monkey with the young ones sits close by, warming himself. Walls and  ceiling are adorned 'with the most singular witch-household stuff_.]           FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Faust_. Would that this vile witch-business were well over!  Dost promise me I shall recover  In this hodge-podge of craziness?  From an old hag do I advice require?  And will this filthy cooked-up mess  My youth by thirty years bring nigher?  Woe's me, if that's the best you know!  Already hope is from my bosom banished.  Has not a noble mind found long ago  Some balsam to restore a youth that's vanished?    _Mephistopheles_. My friend, again thou speakest a wise thought!  I know a natural way to make thee young,--none apter!  But in another book it must be sought,  And is a quite peculiar chapter.    _Faust_. I beg to know it.    _Mephistopheles_. Well! here's one that needs no pay,  No help of physic, nor enchanting.  Out to the fields without delay,  And take to hacking, digging, planting;  Run the same round from day to day,  A treadmill-life, contented, leading,  With simple fare both mind and body feeding,  Live with the beast as beast, nor count it robbery  Shouldst thou manure, thyself, the field thou reapest;  Follow this course and, trust to me,  For eighty years thy youth thou keepest!    _Faust_. I am not used to that, I ne'er could bring me to it,  To wield the spade, I could not do it.  The narrow life befits me not at all.    _Mephistopheles_. So must we on the witch, then, call.    _Faust_. But why just that old hag? Canst thou  Not brew thyself the needful liquor?    _Mephistopheles_. That were a pretty pastime now  I'd build about a thousand bridges quicker.  Science and art alone won't do,  The work will call for patience, too;  Costs a still spirit years of occupation:  Time, only, strengthens the fine fermentation.  To tell each thing that forms a part  Would sound to thee like wildest fable!  The devil indeed has taught the art;  To make it not the devil is able.        [_Espying the animals_.]  See, what a genteel breed we here parade!  This is the house-boy! that's the maid!        [_To the animals_.]  Where's the old lady gone a mousing?    _The animals_. Carousing;  Out she went  By the chimney-vent!    _Mephistopheles_. How long does she spend in gadding and storming?    _The animals_. While we are giving our paws a warming.    _Mephistopheles_ [_to Faust_]. How do you find the dainty creatures?    _Faust_. Disgusting as I ever chanced to see!    _Mephistopheles_. No! a discourse like this to me,  I own, is one of life's most pleasant features;        [_To the animals_.]  Say, cursed dolls, that sweat, there, toiling!  What are you twirling with the spoon?    _Animals_. A common beggar-soup we're boiling.    _Mephistopheles_. You'll have a run of custom soon.             THE HE-MONKEY      [_Comes along and fawns on_ MEPHISTOPHELES].          O fling up the dice,          Make me rich in a trice,          Turn fortune's wheel over!          My lot is right bad,          If money I had,          My wits would recover.    _Mephistopheles_. The monkey'd be as merry as a cricket,  Would somebody give him a lottery-ticket!        [_Meanwhile the young monkeys have been playing with a great       ball, which they roll backward and forward_.]    _The monkey_. 'The world's the ball;          See't rise and fall,          Its roll you follow;          Like glass it rings:          Both, brittle things!          Within 'tis hollow.          There it shines clear,          And brighter here,--          I live--by 'Pollo!--          Dear son, I pray,          Keep hands away!          _Thou_ shalt fall so!          'Tis made of clay,          Pots are, also.    _Mephistopheles_. What means the sieve?    _The monkey [takes it down_]. Wert thou a thief,          'Twould show the thief and shame him.      [_Runs to his mate and makes her look through_.]          Look through the sieve!          Discern'st thou the thief,          And darest not name him?    _Mephistopheles [approaching the fire_]. And what's this pot?    _The monkeys_. The dunce! I'll be shot!          He knows not the pot,          He knows not the kettle!    _Mephistopheles_. Impertinence! Hush!    _The monkey_. Here, take you the brush,          And sit on the settle!       [_He forces_ MEPHISTOPHELES _to sit down_.]             FAUST      [_who all this time has been standing before a looking-glass,       now approaching and now receding from it_].    What do I see? What heavenly face  Doth, in this magic glass, enchant me!  O love, in mercy, now, thy swiftest pinions grant me!  And bear me to her field of space!  Ah, if I seek to approach what doth so haunt me,  If from this spot I dare to stir,  Dimly as through a mist I gaze on her!--  The loveliest vision of a woman!  Such lovely woman can there be?  Must I in these reposing limbs naught human.  But of all heavens the finest essence see?  Was such a thing on earth seen ever?    _Mephistopheles_. Why, when you see a God six days in hard work spend,  And then cry bravo at the end,  Of course you look for something clever.  Look now thy fill; I have for thee  Just such a jewel, and will lead thee to her;  And happy, whose good fortune it shall be,  To bear her home, a prospered wooer!    [FAUST _keeps on looking into the mirror_. MEPHISTOPHELES  _stretching himself out on the settle and playing with the brush,  continues speaking_.]  Here sit I like a king upon his throne,  The sceptre in my hand,--I want the crown alone.              THE ANIMALS     [_who up to this time have been going through all sorts of queer antics      with each other, bring_ MEPHISTOPHELES _a crown with a loud cry_].          O do be so good,--          With sweat and with blood,          To take it and lime it;     [_They go about clumsily with the crown and break it into two pieces,      with which they jump round_.]          'Tis done now! We're free!          We speak and we see,          We hear and we rhyme it;    _Faust [facing the mirror_]. Woe's me! I've almost lost my wits.    _Mephistopheles [pointing to the animals_].  My head, too, I confess, is very near to spinning.    _The animals_. And then if it hits          And every thing fits,          We've thoughts for our winning.    _Faust [as before_]. Up to my heart the flame is flying!  Let us begone--there's danger near!    _Mephistopheles [in the former position_].  Well, this, at least, there's no denying,  That we have undissembled poets here.    [The kettle, which the she-monkey has hitherto left unmatched, begins to  run over; a great flame breaks out, which roars up the chimney. The_ WITCH  _comes riding down through the flame with a terrible outcry_.]    _Witch_. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!        The damned beast! The cursed sow!        Neglected the kettle, scorched the Frau!        The cursed crew!          [_Seeing_ FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES.]        And who are you?        And what d'ye do?        And what d'ye want?        And who sneaked in?        The fire-plague grim        Shall light on him        In every limb!         [_She makes a dive at the kettle with the skimmer and spatters flames        at _FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES_, and the creatures. These last whimper_.]              MEPHISTOPHELES       [_inverting the brush which he holds in his hand, and striking        among the glasses and pots_].          In two! In two!        There lies the brew!        There lies the glass!        This joke must pass;        For time-beat, ass!        To thy melody, 'twill do.      [_While the_ WITCH _starts back full of wrath and horror.]  Skeleton! Scarcecrow! Spectre! Know'st thou me,  Thy lord and master? What prevents my dashing  Right in among thy cursed company,  Thyself and all thy monkey spirits smashing?  Has the red waistcoat thy respect no more?  Has the cock's-feather, too, escaped attention?  Hast never seen this face before?  My name, perchance, wouldst have me mention?    _The witch_. Pardon the rudeness, sir, in me!  But sure no cloven foot I see.  Nor find I your two ravens either.    _Mephistopheles_. I'll let thee off for this once so;  For a long while has passed, full well I know,  Since the last time we met together.  The culture, too, which licks the world to shape,  The devil himself cannot escape;  The phantom of the North men's thoughts have left behind them,  Horns, tail, and claws, where now d'ye find them?  And for the foot, with which dispense I nowise can,  'Twould with good circles hurt my standing;  And so I've worn, some years, like many a fine young man,  False calves to make me more commanding.    _The witch [dancing_]. O I shall lose my wits, I fear,  Do I, again, see Squire Satan here!    _Mephistopheles_. Woman, the name offends my ear!    _The witch_. Why so? What has it done to you?    _Mephistopheles_. It has long since to fable-books been banished;  But men are none the better for it; true,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14461"],[0,"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (#12)"],[1,"attempt to wring out of the New Testament proofs of a crime in itself so  disgustingly improbable. Neither do the exploits of Elymas, called the  Sorcerer, or Simon, called Magus or the Magician, entitle them to rank  above the class of impostors who assumed a character to which they had  no real title, and put their own mystical and ridiculous pretensions to  supernatural power in competition with those who had been conferred on  purpose to diffuse the gospel, and facilitate its reception by the  exhibition of genuine miracles. It is clear that, from his presumptuous  and profane proposal to acquire, by purchase, a portion of those powers  which were directly derived from inspiration, Simon Magus displayed a  degree of profane and brutal ignorance inconsistent with his possessing  even the intelligence of a skilful impostor; and it is plain that a  leagued vassal of hell--should we pronounce him such--would have better  known his own rank and condition, compared to that of the apostles, than  to have made such a fruitless and unavailing proposal, by which he could  only expose his own impudence and ignorance.    With this observation we may conclude our brief remarks upon  _witchcraft_, as the word occurs in the Scripture; and it now only  remains to mention the nature of the _demonology_, which, as gathered  from the sacred volumes, every Christian believer is bound to receive as  a thing declared and proved to be true.    And in the first place, no man can read the Bible, or call himself a  Christian, without believing that, during the course of time  comprehended by the Divine writers, the Deity, to confirm the faith of  the Jews, and to overcome and confound the pride of the heathens,  wrought in the land many great miracles, using either good spirits, the  instruments of his pleasure, or fallen angels, the permitted agents of  such evil as it was his will should be inflicted upon, or suffered by,  the children of men. This proposition comprehends, of course, the  acknowledgment of the truth of miracles during this early period, by  which the ordinary laws of nature were occasionally suspended, and  recognises the existence in the spiritual world of the two grand  divisions of angels and devils, severally exercising their powers  according to the commission or permission of the Ruler of the universe.    Secondly, wise men have thought and argued that the idols of the heathen  were actually fiends, or, rather, that these enemies of mankind had  power to assume the shape and appearance of those feeble deities, and to  give a certain degree of countenance to the faith of the worshippers, by  working seeming miracles, and returning, by their priests or their  oracles, responses which \"palter'd in a double sense\" with the deluded  persons who consulted them. Most of the fathers of the Christian Church  have intimated such an opinion. This doctrine has the advantage of  affording, to a certain extent, a confirmation of many miracles related  in pagan or classical history, which are thus ascribed to the agency of  evil spirits. It corresponds also with the texts of Scripture which  declare that the gods of the heathen are all devils and evil spirits;  and the idols of Egypt are classed, as in Isaiah, chap. xix. ver. 2,  with charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and with wizards. But  whatever license it may be supposed was permitted to the evil spirits of  that period--and although, undoubtedly, men owned the sway of deities  who were, in fact, but personifications of certain evil passions of  humanity, as, for example, in their sacrifices to Venus, to Bacchus, to  Mars, &c., and therefore might be said, in one sense, to worship evil  spirits--we cannot, in reason, suppose that every one, or the thousandth  part of the innumerable idols worshipped among the heathen, was endowed  with supernatural power; it is clear that the greater number fell under  the description applied to them in another passage of Scripture, in  which the part of the tree burned in the fire for domestic purposes is  treated as of the same power and estimation as that carved into an  image, and preferred for Gentile homage. This striking passage, in which  the impotence of the senseless block, and the brutish ignorance of the  worshipper, whose object of adoration is the work of his own hands,  occurs in the 44th chapter of the prophecies of Isaiah, verse 10 _et  seq_. The precise words of the text, as well as common sense, forbid us  to believe that the images so constructed by common artisans became the  habitation or resting-place of demons, or possessed any manifestation of  strength or power, whether through demoniacal influence or otherwise.  The whole system of doubt, delusion, and trick exhibited by the oracles,  savours of the mean juggling of impostors, rather than the audacious  intervention of demons. Whatever degree of power the false gods of  heathendom, or devils in their name, might be permitted occasionally to  exert, was unquestionably under the general restraint and limitation of  providence; and though, on the one hand, we cannot deny the possibility  of such permission being granted in cases unknown to us, it is certain,  on the other, that the Scriptures mention no one specific instance of  such influence expressly recommended to our belief.    Thirdly, as the backsliders among the Jews repeatedly fell off to the  worship of the idols of the neighbouring heathens, so they also resorted  to the use of charms and enchantments, founded on a superstitious  perversion of their own Levitical ritual, in which they endeavoured by  sortilege, by Teraphim, by observation of augury, or the flight of  birds, which they called _Nahas_, by the means of Urim and Thummim, to  find as it were a byroad to the secrets of futurity. But for the same  reason that withholds us from delivering any opinion upon the degree to  which the devil and his angels might be allowed to countenance the  impositions of the heathen priesthood, it is impossible for us  conclusively to pronounce what effect might be permitted by supreme  Providence to the ministry of such evil spirits as presided over, and,  so far as they had liberty, directed, these sinful enquiries among the  Jews themselves. We are indeed assured from the sacred writings, that  the promise of the Deity to his chosen people, if they conducted  themselves agreeably to the law which he had given, was, that the  communication with the invisible world would be enlarged, so that in the  fulness of his time he would pour out his spirit upon all flesh, when  their sons and daughters should prophesy, their old men see visions, and  their young men dream dreams. Such were the promises delivered to the  Israelites by Joel, Ezekiel, and other holy seers, of which St. Peter,  in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, hails the fulfilment  in the mission of our Saviour. And on the other hand, it is no less  evident that the Almighty, to punish the disobedience of the Jews,  abandoned them to their own fallacious desires, and suffered them to be  deceived by the lying oracles, to which, in flagrant violation of his  commands, they had recourse. Of this the punishment arising from the  Deity abandoning Ahab to his own devices, and suffering him to be  deceived by a lying spirit, forms a striking instance.    Fourthly, and on the other hand, abstaining with reverence from  accounting ourselves judges of the actions of Omnipotence, we may safely  conclude that it was not his pleasure to employ in the execution of his  judgments the consequences of any such species of league or compact  betwixt devils and deluded mortals, as that denounced in the laws of our  own ancestors under the name of _witchcraft_. What has been translated  by that word seems little more than the art of a medicator of poisons,  combined with that of a Pythoness or false prophetess; a crime, however,  of a capital nature, by the Levitical law, since, in the first capacity,  it implied great enmity to mankind, and in the second, direct treason to  the divine Legislator. The book of Tobit contains, indeed, a passage  resembling more an incident in an Arabian tale or Gothic romance, than a  part of inspired writing. In this, the fumes produced by broiling the  liver of a certain fish are described as having power to drive away an  evil genius who guards the nuptial chamber of an Assyrian princess, and  who has strangled seven bridegrooms in succession, as they approached  the nuptial couch. But the romantic and fabulous strain of this legend  has induced the fathers of all Protestant churches to deny it a place  amongst the writings sanctioned by divine origin, and we may therefore  be excused from entering into discussion on such imperfect evidence.    Lastly, in considering the incalculable change which took place upon the  Advent of our Saviour and the announcement of his law, we may observe  that, according to many wise and learned men, his mere appearance upon  earth, without awaiting the fulfilment of his mission, operated as an  act of banishment of such heathen deities as had hitherto been suffered  to deliver oracles, and ape in some degree the attributes of the Deity.  Milton has, in the \"Paradise Lost,\" it may be upon conviction of its  truth, embraced the theory which identifies the followers of Satan with  the gods of the heathen; and, in a tone of poetry almost unequalled,  even in his own splendid writings, he thus describes, in one of his  earlier pieces, the departure of these pretended deities on the eve of  the blessed Nativity:--      \"The oracles are dumb,     No voice or hideous hum  Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving;     Apollo from his shrine     Can no more divine,  With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving;  No nightly trance or breathed spell  Inspires the pale-eyed priests from the prophetic cell.      \"The lonely mountains o'er,     And the resounding shore,  A voice"]]]
