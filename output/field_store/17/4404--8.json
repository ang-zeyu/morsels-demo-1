COLOCYNTH, on the other  hand, has according to Orfila, a specific stimulant influence over the  large intestines. The combination of these two drugs forms a Valuable  Medicine in the treatment of complaints arising from Disorders of the  Liver and Bowels, such as: Furred Tongue, Disagreeable Taste in the  Mouth, Headache, Giddiness, General Lassitude, Pains in the  Back--especially under the shoulder blade--and irregular action of the  bowels and other excretory organs.

The German losses were upwards of 150,000 men. On the  coast the Belgians cut the dikes of the river Yser ([=i]'ser) and flooded  the neighboring lowlands, thus putting a stop to any further advance of  the enemy.    TRENCH WARFARE.--By this time the combatants had reached a temporary  deadlock. Both had adopted trench tactics, and for over three hundred  miles, from the sea to the Swiss border, two systems of entrenchments  paralleled one another. The trenches were protected in front by  intricate networks of barbed wire. Looked at from above, the trenches  seemed to be dug with little system. But they rigidly adhered to one  military maxim,--that fortifications must not continue in a straight  line, because such straight trenches are liable to be enfiladed from  either end. Hence the trenches curve and twist, with here and there  supporting trenches and supply trenches. Sometimes the trenches are  covered; sometimes dugouts and caves are constructed. Every turn or  corner is protected with machine-guns. In some portions of the line  these trenches faced one another for over four years with scarcely any  change in their relative locations.    GERMAN TREATMENT OF OCCUPIED TERRITORY.--Eastward of the German  trenches lay all of Belgium except a very small corner, and the richest  manufacturing districts of France, including eighty per cent of the  iron and steel industries, and fifty per cent of the coal. On the other  hand the Allies had occupied only a small section of German territory at  the southern end of the line, in Alsace.    German occupation of Belgium and northeastern France was accompanied by  horrible barbarities and systematic frightfulness, which were in  violation of the Hague Conventions as well as of other laws and usages  of civilized warfare. The aim at first was to terrorize the people and  reduce them to a condition of fear and of servility to the conquerors.  Men and women were executed without adequate evidence or trial; many  German soldiers were quartered in the homes; at the slightest sign of  resistance innocent persons were punished for the guilty; immense fines  and forced contributions were imposed upon the communities; furniture,  works of art, beautiful buildings, and historic structures were  ruthlessly pillaged and destroyed. In the second place, the Germans  began a systematic plundering of the occupied country, taking for  transportation to Germany anything they deemed useful or valuable.  Nearly every article made of metal, wool, rubber, or leather was seized.  Machinery from Belgian and French factories was taken to German  establishments. Households were compelled to surrender bathtubs, door  knobs and knockers, kitchen utensils, gas fixtures, bedclothes, etc.  Food, farm animals, and farm products were confiscated; and the  population was saved from actual starvation only by the energies of  Belgium's friends in France, England, and America. At a later time, a  third policy of the Germans was to drag Belgian and French young men and  women away from their families and relatives and compel them to work far  from their homes in factories, fields, and mines. Probably more than two  hundred thousand persons were forced into this industrial slavery.  Finally, where the Germans were forced to retire from the lands they had  occupied in northern France and in Belgium, they sought to reduce much  of the evacuated territory to a desert condition. Not only were bridges  and roads destroyed, but houses, factories, and churches were leveled to  the ground, and the foundation walls and cellars were obliterated. In  some parts of France even the fruit trees and grapevines, the product of  many years' growth and care, were systematically destroyed, and  everything which might make the land habitable disappeared.    THE WAR IN THE EAST.--As has already been explained, the German  military leaders had counted upon a rapid crushing of France by way of  Belgium before Russia should have time to complete her military  preparations for attacking eastern Germany. But during the time lost  through the unexpected resistance of Belgium huge Russian armies were  gathered together in Russian Poland for an invasion of Germany and  Austria-Hungary.    The western border of Russian Poland is less than two hundred miles from  Berlin. But Russia could not advance along this road without running  the risk of having the Germans from the north and the Austrians from the  south cut off her armies from their sources of supply in Russia. In  other words, Russia dared not advance on Berlin without first driving  the Germans out of East Prussia and the Austrians from Galicia. Hence  the plan of her campaign in 1914 was to invade these two provinces.    [Illustration: EASTERN FRONT Dec. 31, 1914]    BATTLE OF TANNENBERG.--Two Russian armies entered East Prussia in the  middle of August. At first they met with success. The nature of the  country, however, was against them, as there was a chain of almost  impassable lakes, marshes, and rivers stretching across their route. In  this difficult territory they were surprised by German reinforcements  which had been rushed to the east. In the battle of Tan'nenberg (August  26-31), the German troops under the command of General von Hindenburg  inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Russians, capturing 70,000 men and  large quantities of supplies. Hindenburg followed up his success, and  the Russians were completely expelled from East Prussia.    THE RUSSIANS OVERRUN GALICIA.--The second part of the Russian plan,  the invasion of Galicia, was more successful. In September the important  city of Lemberg was taken, and the fortress of Przemysl (pshem'ishl) was  besieged. By December almost the whole province was in Russian hands.  South of Galicia, separating it from Hungary, are the Carpathian  Mountains. Russian troops penetrated the passes of this mountain wall  and conducted a series of successful raids upon the plains of northern  Hungary.    THE RUSSIAN SITUATION AT THE CLOSE OF 1914.--At the end of the year  Russia, while she had achieved success in Galicia, had failed in East  Prussia. An advance toward Berlin was for the time out of the question.  Indeed the Germans had themselves taken the offensive and had entered  Russian Poland. In October an advance of German and Austrian troops  threatened Warsaw, the most important city in Poland. The Russians in  spite of strong efforts were unable to drive their enemies entirely out  of this region. On the whole, therefore, the Russian situation at the  end of 1914 was disappointing. Russia's accomplishment consisted of her  victories in Galicia, and, probably more important, the drawing of  German troops from the western front and the consequent weakening of  Germany's offensive in France and Belgium. Russia was no farther on the  road to Berlin than at the opening of the war.    SERBIAN RESISTANCE TO AUSTRIA.--An Austrian attempt to overwhelm  Serbia in the first weeks of the war met with disastrous failure. This  was due to two causes: (1) the brave resistance of the Serbian troops;  (2) the fact that the greater part of the Austrian forces had to be used  for defense against the Russian invaders of Galicia. Serbia after severe  fighting compelled the Austrians to retreat beyond their own boundaries.  Early in September the Serbians took the offensive and began an invasion  of Austria-Hungary. This venture failed, and before long Serbia was once  more resisting the enemy on her own soil. Belgrade fell into Austrian  hands on December 2. It did not long remain in the possession of the  conquerors. On the 14th, it was regained by the Serbians, and the  Austrian armies once more expelled. The little Balkan kingdom seemed to  be holding her own.    TURKEY ENTERS THE WAR.--In the years before the war, Germany had  carefully cultivated the friendship of the Turkish government. By means  of intrigue, she had practically made herself master of that country,  particularly in military matters. The Turkish army had been trained by  Germans, and many of its officers were Germans. Although at the opening  of the war Turkey declared herself neutral, she soon showed herself an  ally of the Central Powers. There is evidence to show that as early as  August 4 she had entered into a secret treaty with Germany. In October  Turkey startled the world by bombarding a Russian port on the Black Sea  and destroying French and Russian vessels at Odessa. These acts were  regarded by Russia as acts of war. A few days later France and Great  Britain declared war on Turkey.    [Illustration: GERMAN COLONIES and locations of early naval  engagements.]    Germany welcomed the entrance of Turkey into the war for two reasons. In  the first place she expected that the Mohammedans under English and  French rule, that is, those living in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, and  India, would join the Turkish Sultan, the religious head of the  Mohammedan world, and engage in a \"Holy War\" against Great Britain and  France. In this hope she was doomed to disappointment. In the second  place Germany rejoiced at the arrival of a new enemy for Russia who  might keep the Russians occupied along their southern borders and so  weaken their efforts on other fronts.    GERMAN COLONIES IN THE PACIFIC.--During the first four months of the  war all of Germany's possessions in the Pacific were lost to her. On the  outbreak of the war, Australia and New Zealand promptly organized  expeditionary forces which attacked and captured the German colonies and  coaling stations situated south of the Equator. German Samoa, the first  to be taken, surrendered to the New Zealand expeditionary force August  29. The other German possessions in the South Pacific surrendered to the  Australians.
