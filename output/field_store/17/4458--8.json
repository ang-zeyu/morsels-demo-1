Each of these stages must correspond to a different age. To  these we may add the larvae produced by the last hatching of eggs,  creatures too minute to be noticed by my rustic helpers, and we obtain  four years as the probable term of the larvae underground.    The length of their aerial existence is more easily computed. I hear the  first Cigales about the summer solstice. A month later the orchestra has  attained its full power. A very few late singers execute their feeble  solos until the middle of September. This is the end of the concert. As  all the larvae do not issue from the ground at the same time, it is  evident that the singers of September are not contemporary with those  that began to sing at the solstice. Taking the average between these two  dates, we get five weeks as the probable duration of the Cigales' life  on earth.    Four years of hard labour underground, and a month of feasting in the  sun; such is the life of the Cigale. Do not let us again reproach the  adult insect with his triumphant delirium. For four years, in the  darkness he has worn a dirty parchment overall; for four years he has  mined the soil with his talons, and now the mud-stained sapper is  suddenly clad in the finest raiment, and provided with wings that rival  the bird's; moreover, he is drunken with heat and flooded with light,  the supreme terrestrial joy. His cymbals will never suffice to celebrate  such felicity, so well earned although so ephemeral.          CHAPTER V    THE MANTIS.--THE CHASE      There is another creature of the Midi which is quite as curious and  interesting as the Cigale, but much less famous, as it is voiceless. If  Providence had provided it with cymbals, which are a prime element of  popularity, it would soon have eclipsed the renown of the celebrated  singer, so strange is its shape, and so peculiar its manners. It is  called by the Provencals _lou Prego-Dieu_, the creature which prays to  God. Its official name is the Praying Mantis (_Mantis religiosa_, Lin.).    For once the language of science and the vocabulary of the peasant  agree. Both represent the Mantis as a priestess delivering oracles, or  an ascetic in a mystic ecstasy. The comparison is a matter of antiquity.  The ancient Greeks called the insect [Greek: Mantis], the divine, the  prophet. The worker in the fields is never slow in perceiving analogies;  he will always generously supplement the vagueness of the facts. He has  seen, on the sun-burned herbage of the meadows, an insect of commanding  appearance, drawn up in majestic attitude. He has noticed its wide,  delicate wings of green, trailing behind it like long linen veils; he  has seen its fore-limbs, its arms, so to speak, raised towards to the  sky in a gesture of invocation. This was enough: popular imagination  has done the rest; so that since the period of classical antiquity the  bushes have been peopled with priestesses emitting oracles and nuns in  prayer.    Good people, how very far astray your childlike simplicity has led you!  These attitudes of prayer conceal the most atrocious habits; these  supplicating arms are lethal weapons; these fingers tell no rosaries,  but help to exterminate the unfortunate passer-by. It is an exception  that we should never look for in the vegetarian family of the  Orthoptera, but the Mantis lives exclusively upon living prey. It is the  tiger of the peaceful insect peoples; the ogre in ambush which demands a  tribute of living flesh. If it only had sufficient strength its  blood-thirsty appetites, and its horrible perfection of concealment  would make it the terror of the countryside. The _Prego-Dieu_ would  become a Satanic vampire.    Apart from its lethal weapon the Mantis has nothing about it to inspire  apprehension. It does not lack a certain appearance of graciousness,  with its slender body, its elegant waist-line, its tender green  colouring, and its long gauzy wings. No ferocious jaws, opening like  shears; on the contrary, a fine pointed muzzle which seems to be made  for billing and cooing. Thanks to a flexible neck, set freely upon the  thorax, the head can turn to right or left as on a pivot, bow, or raise  itself high in the air. Alone among insects, the Mantis is able to  direct its gaze; it inspects and examines; it has almost a physiognomy.    There is a very great contrast between the body as a whole, which has a  perfectly peaceable aspect, and the murderous fore-limbs. The haunch of  the fore-limb is unusually long and powerful. Its object is to throw  forward the living trap which does not wait for the victim, but goes in  search of it. The snare is embellished with a certain amount of  ornamentation. On the inner face the base of the haunch is decorated  with a pretty black spot relieved by smaller spots of white, and a few  rows of fine pearly spots complete the ornamentation.    The thigh, still longer, like a flattened spindle, carries on the  forward half of the lower face a double row of steely spines. The  innermost row contains a dozen, alternately long and black and short and  green. This alternation of unequal lengths makes the weapon more  effectual for holding. The outer row is simpler, having only four teeth.  Finally, three needle-like spikes, the longest of all, rise behind the  double series of spikes. In short, the thigh is a saw with two parallel  edges, separated by a groove in which the foreleg lies when folded.    The foreleg, which is attached to the thigh by a very flexible  articulation, is also a double-edged saw, but the teeth are smaller,  more numerous, and closer than those of the thigh. It terminates in a  strong hook, the point of which is as sharp as the finest needle: a hook  which is fluted underneath and has a double blade like a pruning-knife.    A weapon admirably adapted for piercing and tearing, this hook has  sometimes left me with visible remembrances. Caught in turn by the  creature which I had just captured, and not having both hands free, I  have often been obliged to get a second person to free me from my  tenacious captive! To free oneself by violence without disengaging the  firmly implanted talons would result in lacerations such as the thorns  of a rosebush will produce. None of our insects is so inconvenient to  handle. The Mantis digs its knife-blades into your flesh, pierces you  with its needles, seizes you as in a vice, and renders self-defence  almost impossible if, wishing to take your quarry alive, you refrain  from crushing it out of existence.    When the Mantis is in repose its weapons are folded and pressed against  the thorax, and are perfectly inoffensive in appearance. The insect is  apparently praying. But let a victim come within reach, and the attitude  of prayer is promptly abandoned. Suddenly unfolded, the three long  joints of the deadly fore-limbs shoot out their terminal talons, which  strike the victim and drag it backwards between the two saw-blades of  the thighs. The vice closes with a movement like that of the forearm  upon the upper arm, and all is over; crickets, grasshoppers, and even  more powerful insects, once seized in this trap with its four rows of  teeth, are lost irreparably. Their frantic struggles will never release  the hold of this terrible engine of destruction.    The habits of the Mantis cannot be continuously studied in the freedom  of the fields; the insect must be domesticated. There is no difficulty  here; the Mantis is quite indifferent to imprisonment under glass,  provided it is well fed. Offer it a tasty diet, feed it daily, and it  will feel but little regret for its native thickets.    For cages I use a dozen large covers of wire gauze, such as are used in  the larder to protect meat from the flies. Each rests upon a tray full  of sand. A dry tuft of thyme and a flat stone on which the eggs may be  laid later on complete the furnishing of such a dwelling. These cages  are placed in a row on the large table in my entomological laboratory,  where the sun shines on them during the greater part of the day. There  I install my captives; some singly, some in groups.    It is in the latter half of August that I begin to meet with the adult  insect on the faded herbage and the brambles at the roadside. The  females, whose bellies are already swollen, are more numerous every day.  Their slender companions, on the other hand, are somewhat rare, and I  often have some trouble in completing my couples; whose relations will  finally be terminated by a tragic consummation. But we will reserve  these amenities for a later time, and will consider the females first.    They are tremendous eaters, so that their entertainment, when it lasts  for some months is not without difficulties. Their provisions must be  renewed every day, for the greater part are disdainfully tasted and  thrown aside. On its native bushes I trust the Mantis is more  economical. Game is not too abundant, so that she doubtless devours her  prey to the last atom; but in my cages it is always at hand. Often,  after a few mouthfuls, the insect will drop the juicy morsel without  displaying any further interest in it. Such is the ennui of captivity!    To provide them with a luxurious table I have to call in assistants. Two  or three of the juvenile unemployed of my neighbourhood, bribed by  slices of bread and jam or of melon, search morning and evening on the  neighbouring lawns, where they fill their game-bags, little cases made  from sections of reeds, with living grasshoppers and crickets. On my own  part, I make a daily tour of the paddock, net in hand, with the object  of obtaining some choice dish for my guests.    These particular captures are destined to show me just how far the  vigour and audacity of the Mantis will lead it.
