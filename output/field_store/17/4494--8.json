After  some such manner many of our prodigies come to passe, and the people are  willing to believe anything, which they may relate to others as a very  strange and wonderfull event. I doubt not but the Trojan _Palladium_,  the Romane _Minerva_, and our Ladies Church at _Loretto_, with many  sacred reliques preserved by the Papists might droppe from the Moone as  well as any of these.    But it may be againe objected, suppose there were a bullet shot up in  that world, would not the Moone runne away from it, before it could fall  downe, since the motion of her body (being every day round our earth) is  farre swifter than the other, and so the bullet must be left behinde,  and at length fall downe to us? To this I answer,    1. If a bullet could be shot so farre till it came to the circumference  of those things which belong to our center, then it would fall downe to  us.    2. Though there were some heavie body a great height in that ayer, yet  would the motion of its centre by an attractive vertue still hold it  within its convenient distance, so that whether their earth moved or  stood still, yet would the same violence cast a body from it equally  farre. That I may the plainer expresse my meaning, I will set downe this  Diagramme.      [Illustration as described in text]    Suppose this earth were A, which was to move in the circle C, D. and let  the bullet be supposed at B. within its proper verge; I say, whether  this earth did stand stil or move swiftly towards D, yet the bullet  would still keepe at the same distance by reason of that Magneticke  vertue of the center (if I may so speake) whereby all things within its  spheare are attracted with it. So that the violence to the bullet, being  nothing else but that whereby 'tis removed from its center, therefore an  equall violence can carry a body from its proper place, but at an equall  distance whether or no the center stand still or move.    The impartiall Reader may finde sufficient satisfaction for this and  such other arguments as may be urged against the motion of that earth in  the writings of _Capernicus_ and his followers, unto whom for brevities  sake I will referre them.          Proposition 9.    _That there are high Mountaines, deepe vallies, and spacious plains    in the body of the Moone._      Though there are some who thinke Mountaines to bee a deformity in the  earth, as if they were either beate up by the flood, or else cast up  like so many heaps of rubbish left at the creation, yet if well  considered, they will be found as much to conduce to the beauty and  conveniency of the universe as any of the other parts. Nature (saith  _Pliny_[1]) purposely framed them for many excellent uses: partly to  tame the violence of greater Rivers, to strengthen certaine joynts  within the veines and bowels of the earth, to breake the force of the  Seas inundation, and for the safety of the earths inhabitants, whether  beasts or men. That they make much for the protection of beasts the  Psalmist[2] testifies, _The highest hils are a refuge for the wilde  Goats, and the rockes for Conies_. The Kingly Prophet had learned the  safety of these by his owne experience, when he also was faine to make a  mountaine his refuge from the fury of his Master _Saul_, who persecuted  him in the wildernesse.      [Sidenote 1: _Nat. hist. l. 36. c. 1._]      [Sidenote 2: Psal. 104. v. 18.]    True indeed, such places as these keepe their neighbours poore, as  beeing most barren, but yet they preserve them safe, as being most  strong, witnesse our unconquered _Wales_ and _Scotland_, whose greatest  protection hath beene the naturall strength of their Countrey, so  fortified with Mountaines, that these have alwaies been unto them sure  retraites from the violence and oppression of others, wherefore a good  Authour doth rightly call them natures bulwarkes cast up at God  Almighties owne charges, the scornes and curbs of victorious armies,  which made the Barbarians in _Curtius_ so confident of their owne  safety, when they were once retired to an inaccessible mountaine, that  when _Alexanders_ Legate had brought them to a parley and perswading  them to yeeld, told them of his masters victories, what Seas and  Wildernesses hee had passed, they replyed that all that might be, but  could _Alexander_ fly too? Over the Seas he might have ships, and over  the land horses, but hee must have wings before he could get up thither.  Such safety did those barbarous nations conceive in the mountaines  whereunto they were retyred, certainely then such usefull parts were not  the effect of mans sinne, or produced by the Worlds curse the flood, but  rather at the first created by the goodnesse and providence of the  Almighty.    So that if I intend to prove that the Moone is such a habitable world as  this is, 'tis requisite that I shew it to have the same conveniences of  habitation as this hath, and here if some Rabbi or Chymicke were to  handle the point they would first prove it out of Scripture, from that  place in _Moses_ his blessing,[1] where hee speakes of the ancient  mountaines and lasting hils, _Deut._ #Hareray kedem ugva'ot olam#  for having immediately before mentioned those blessings which should  happen unto _Ioseph_ by the influence of the Moone, he does presently  exegetically iterate them in blessing him with the chiefe things of  the ancient Mountaines and lasting hils; you may also see the same  expression used in _Iacobs_ blessing of _Ioseph_.[2]      [Sidenote 1: Deut. 33. 15]      [Sidenote 2: Gen. 49. 26]    But however we may deale _pro_ or _con_ in Philosophy, yet we must not  jest with divine truths, or bring Scripture to patronize any fancy of  our owne, though, perhaps, it be truth. For the better proofe of this  proposition, I might here cite the testimony of _Diodorus_, who thought  the Moone to bee full of rugged places, _vel ut terrestribus tumulis  superciliosam_, but he erred much in some circumstances of this opinion,  especially where he saies, there is an Iland amongst the _Hyperboreans_,  wherein those hils may to the eye bee plainely discovered, and for this  reason. [1]*_Caelius_ calls him a fabulous Writer, but you may see more  expresse authority for the proofe of this in the opinions of  _Anaxagoras_ and _Democritus_,[2] who held that this Planet was full of  champion grounds, mountains and vallies, and this seemed likewise  probable unto _Augustinus Nifus_, whose words are these:      _Forsitan non est remotum dicere, lunae partes esse diversas, veluti    sunt partes terrae, quarum aliae sunt vallosae, aliae montosae, ex quarum    differentia effici potest facies illa lunae; nec est rationi dissonum,    nam luna est corpus imperfecte Sphaericum, cum sit corpus ab ultimo    coelo elongatum, ut supra dixit Aristoteles._      \"Perhaps, it would not be amisse to say that the parts of the Moone    were divers, as the parts of this earth, whereof some are vallies,    and some mountaines, from the difference of which, some spots in the    Moone may proceed, nor is this against reason, for that Planet cannot    be perfectly sphericall, since 'tis so remote a body from the first    orbe, as _Aristotle_ had said before.\"    You may see this truth assented unto by _Blancanus_ the Jesuit,[3] and  by him confirmed with with divers reasons. _Keplar_ hath observed in the  Moones eclipses,[4] that the division of her enlightened part from the  shaded, was made by a crooked unequall line, of which there cannot be  any probable cause conceived, unlesse it did arise from the ruggednesse  of that planet, for it cannot at all be produc'd from the shade of any  mountains here upon earth, because these would be so lessned before they  could reach so high in a conicall shadow, that they would not be at all  sensible unto us (as might easily be demonstrated) nor can it be  conceived what reason of this difference there should be in the Sunne.  Wherefore there being no other body that hath any thing to doe in  eclipses, we must necessarily conclude, that it is caused by a variety  of parts in the Moone it selfe, and what can there be but its  gibbosities? Now if you should aske a reason why there should be such a  similitude of these in that Planet, the same _Keplar_ shall jest you out  an answere, for supposing (saith he) those inhabitants are bigger than  any of us in the same proportion, as their daies are longer than ours,  viz. by fifteen times it may bee for want of stones to erect such vast  houses as were requisite for their bodies, they are faine to digge great  and round hollowes in the earth, where they may both procure water for  their thirst, and turning about with the shade, may avoid those great  heats which otherwise they would be lyable unto; or if you will give  _Caesar la Galla_ leave to guesse in the same manner, he would rather  think that those thirsty nations cast up so many and so great heaps of  earth in digging of their wine cellars, but this onely by the way.

Opt. c. 6. num 9._]    I shall next produce the eye-witnesse of _Galilaeus_,[1] on which I most  of all depend for the proofe of this Proposition, when he beheld the new  Moone through his perspective, it appeared to him under a rugged and  spotted figure, seeming to have the darker and enlightned parts divided  by a tortuous line, having some parcels of light at a good distance from  the other, and this difference is so remarkable, that you may easily  perceive it through one of those ordinary perspectives, which are  commonly sold amongst us, but for your better apprehending of what I  deliver, I will set downe the Figure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#12)"],[1,"by that term was, in his  opinion, buried underground and merely foundation. The floor of the  portico of the temple (he says) was about level with the floor of the  court which surrounded the temple; the floor of the _cella_, though  higher, was but a trifle higher (see figs. 26, 27). This view needs more  reflection than he has given it in his rather brief account. No doubt  a temple in a Celtic land might have been built on a classical plan,  though without a classical _podium_. But it is not what one would most  expect. Nor do I feel sure that it was actually done at Wroxeter in this  case. The walls which Mr. Bushe-Fox explains as the foundations of the  temple are quite needlessly good masonry for foundations never meant to  be seen; this will be plain from figs. 27, 28, which I reproduce by  permission from his Report. Further, as fig. 26 (from the same source)  shows, there was outside the base of this masonry a level cobbled  surface, for which no structural reason is to be found. This, one may  guess, was a pavement at the original ground-level when the temple was  first erected; from this, steps presumably led up to the floor of the  portico and _cella_. The 'podium', then, was at first a real _podium_.  Later, the ground-level rose, and the walls of the _podium_ were buried.    [Illustration: FIG. 25. TEMPLE AT WROXETER]    [Illustration: FIG. 26. FOUNDATIONS OF WROXETER TEMPLE]      _Somerset_    (34) In his handsome volume, _Wookey Hole, its caves and cave-dwellers_  (London, 1914), Mr. H. E. Balch collects for general antiquarian readers  the results of his long exploration of this Mendip cave; some of these  results were noted in my Report for 1913, p. 47. The cave, as a whole,  contained--besides copious prehistoric remains--two well-defined Roman  layers, with many potsherds, including a little Samian and one Samian  stamp given as PIIR PIIT OFII (apparently a new variety of Perpetuus),  broken glass, a few fibulae and other bronze and iron objects, and  106 coins. These coins are:--1 Republican (124-103 B.C., Marcia),  1 Vespasian, 1 Titus, 1 Trajan, 2 Hadrian, 2 Pius; then, 3 Gallienus,  1 Salonina, 1 Carausius, 2 Chlorus, 1 Theodora, 6 Constantinopolis,  1 Crispus, 4 Constantine II, 4 Magnentius, 4 Constantius II, with 20  Valentinian I, 14 Valens, 21 Gratian, 7 Valentinian II, and 6 illegible.  Just two-thirds of the coins are later than A.D. 364; they may be set  beside the late hoard found at Wookey Hole in 1852, which Mr. Balch  might well have mentioned. Plainly, the later Roman layer in the cave  belongs to the end of the fourth century. The date of the other layer is  harder to fix, since we are not told how the coins and potsherds were  distributed between the layers. Probably the cave was long inhabited  casually but in the troubled time of the latest Empire became a place of  refuge or otherwise attracted more numerous occupants. That, if true, is  a more interesting result that Mr. Balch realizes. For in general the  cave-life of Roman Britain belonged to the first two or three centuries  of our era; it is only rarely, and mostly in the west country, that the  caves contain among their Roman relics objects of the late fourth  century (see _Victoria Hist. Derbyshire_, i. 233-42). I must add that  Mr. Balch repeats on pp. 57-8 the error about the significance of the  Republican coin which was noted in my Report for 1915.    (35) The _Proceedings of the Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural  History Society_ for 1913 (vol. lix, Taunton, 1914) record small Roman  finds at Bratton and Barrington (part i, pp. 24, 65, 76, and part ii, p.  79), and describe in detail Mr. Gray's trial excavations at Cadbury  Castle. Cadbury, it seems, was occupied mainly in the Celtic period,  before the Roman conquest.    (36) A little light is thrown on two Somerset 'villas' in _Notes and  Queries for Somerset and Dorset_ (xiv. 1914). (_a_) Skinner in 1818  excavated a 'villa' near Camerton which he recorded in his manuscripts.  (British Mus. Add. 33659, &c.) and which I described in print in the  _Victoria History of Somerset_ (i. 315). His account did not, however,  enable one to fix the precise site; he said only that it stood south  of a certain Ridgeway and next to a field called Chessils. Mr. E. J.  Holmroyd has now, with the aid of tithe maps, discovered a field called  Chessils in the north of Midsomer Norton parish, about a mile east of  Paulton village, at the point where a lane called in the Ordnance Survey  'Coldharbour Lane', which runs north and south, cuts a lane running  east and west from Camerton to Paulton; this latter lane keeps to high  ground and must be Skinner's Ridgeway. In Chessils and in adjoining  fields called Cornwell, just 525 feet above sea-level, he has, further,  actually found Roman potsherds, tiles, and rough tesserae. This, as he  says (_Notes and Queries_, xiv. 5, and in a letter to me) will be the  site of Skinner's 'villa.' (_b_) In the same publication (p. 122) I have  pointed out that the Parish Award (1798) of Chedzoy, near Bridgwater,  contains a field-name Chesters. This, as the Rector of Chedzoy attests,  is still in use there, as the name of an orchard on the Manor Farm, just  west of Chedzoy village. According to older statements, a hypocaust was  long ago found in 'Slapeland', and Slapeland too lies west of Chedzoy  village (see _Vict. Hist. Somerset_, i. 359). Two bits of slender  evidence seem thus to confirm each other, although no actual Roman  remains have been noted at Chedzoy lately.    (37) In the _Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London_ (xxvi.  137-44) Mr. A. Bulleid describes, with illustrations, some excavations  which he lately made in the marshes north of the Polden Hills, near  Cossington and Chilton. Here are curious mounds which have often been  taken for some kind of potteries, and are so explained by Mr. Bulleid;  many of these mounds were excavated about a hundred years ago, and Mr.  Bulleid has now dug into others. His results are not very conclusive,  but they seem to imply that the mounds, whatever they were, were not  used for pottery making, since among many relics of various sorts no  'wasters' have been found. See further, for an account of the finds in  this region, _Victoria Hist. of Somerset_, i. 351-3.      _Surrey_    (38) The _Surrey Archaelogical Collections_ (vol. xxvi) note various  small Roman finds--Roman bricks in the walls of Fetcham Church, possibly  Roman plaster at Stoke D'Abernon Church (p. 123), some thirty coins  and Roman urns and glass from Ewell (pp. 135, 148), and an urn from  Camberwell (p. 149). The same journal (vol. xxvii, p. 155) notes the  discovery, not hitherto recorded, of over 100 coins of A.D. 296-312 in  an urn dug up in 1904 at Normandy Manor Nurseries, near Guildford.    (39) A _Schedule of Antiquities in the County of Surrey_, by Mr. P. M.  Johnston (Guildford, 1913), seems intended for students of mediaeval and  modern antiquities, and says little about Roman remains; it has no index  and cites no authorities.      _Sussex_    (40) A Roman well has been examined near Ham Farm, between Hassocks  railway station and Hurstpierpoint. It was 38 feet deep, the upper part  round and lined with local blue clay, the lower part square and lined  with stout oak planks. The only object recorded from it is a 'first  century vase', taken out at half-way down, which suggests that the well  collapsed at an early date. Another well, flint-lined, was noted near  but not explored; Roman potsherds were picked up not far off (_Sussex  Archaeological Collections_, lvi. 197). The remains probably belong to  a farm detected close by in 1857 (_S. A. C._ xiv. 178). Traces of Roman  civilized life are comparatively common in this neighbourhood.    (41) Mr. R. G. Roberts' volume, _The Place-names of Sussex_ (Cambridge  University Press, 1914), much resembles the Derbyshire monograph noted  above (No. 7). Its selection of place-names is about as limited and  its neglect of all but purely phonetic considerations is as marked.  Names such as Cold Waltham (beside a Roman road), Adur, Lavant, Arun,  Chanctonbury, Mount Caburn, do not find a place in it. From a full  criticism by Dr. H. Bradley in the _English Historical Review_ (xxx.  161-6) one would infer that its philology, too, is by no means  satisfactory.      _Westmorland_    (42) The _Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and  Archaeological Society_ (xiv. 433-65) contain the first Report, by Mr.  R. G. Collingwood, of the excavation of the Roman fort at Borrans Ring,  near Ambleside, covering the period from August 1913 to April 1914. It  is an excellent piece of description and well illustrated; due attention  is given to the small objects; the whole is scholarly and satisfactory.  It is perhaps as well to add that one or two details first found in  April 1914 were further explored in the following August, and some  corrections were obtained which will be published in the second Report.  For the rest see above, p. 10.      _Wilts._    (43) I have contributed to the _Proceedings of the Bath and District  Branch of the Somersetshire Archaeological Society and Natural History_  for 1914 (p. 50) a note on the relief of Diana found at Nettleton Scrub,  to much the same effect as the paragraph on this sculpture in my Report  for 1913 (p. 49).    (44) The _Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London_ (xxvi.  209) contain a note by Mr. E. H. Binney on Roman remains on the known  Roman site, Nythe Farm, about three miles east of Swindon.      _Worcestershire_    (45) The same _Proceedings_ (xxvi. 206) contain an account by Dr. G. B.  Grundy of two sections which he dug lately across the line of Rycknield  Street on the high ground south-east of Broadway, thereby helping to fix  the road at this point. A sketch-map is added.      _Yorkshire_    (46) In the _Bradford Antiquary_ for October 1914 (iv. 117-34) Dr. F.  Villy "]]]
