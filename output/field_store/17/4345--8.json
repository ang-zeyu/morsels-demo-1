Will meet you at a quarter to nine outside Mrs. Tennant's  house.\"    When Kathleen received the communication her eyes flashed with delighted  fire. She thrust the letter into her pocket and proceeded with her work.  The Irish girl looked quite happy that day; she had something to  interest her at last. Her lessons, too, were by no means distasteful.  She had a great deal of quick wit and ready perception. Hitherto she had  been taught anyhow, but now she was all keen to receive real  instruction. Her intuitions were rapid indeed; she could come to  startlingly quick conclusions, and as a rule her guesses were correct  rather than otherwise. Kathleen had a passion for music; she had never  been properly taught, but the soul of music was in her as much as it was  in David Tennant. She had a beautiful melodious voice, which had, of  course, not yet come to maturity. Just before the end of the morning she  took her first lesson in music. Her mistress was a very amiable and  clever woman of the name of Agnes Spicer. Miss Spicer put a sheet of  music before her.    \"Play that,\" she said.    Kathleen frowned. Her delicate white fingers trembled for an instant on  the keys. She played one or two bars perforce and very badly; then she  dashed the sheet of music in an impetuous way to the floor.    \"I can't,\" she said; \"it isn't my style. May I play you something  different?\"    Miss Spicer was about to refuse, but looking at the girl, whose cheeks  were flushed and eyes full of fire, she changed her mind.    \"Just this once,\" she said; \"but you must begin to practice properly.  What I call amateur music can't be allowed here.\"    \"Will this be allowed?\" said Kathleen.    She dashed into heavy chords, played lightly a delicate movement, and  then broke into an Irish air, \"The Harp that once through Tara's Halls.\"  From one Irish melody to another her light fingers wandered. She played  with perfect correctness--with fire, with spirit. Soon she forgot  herself. When she stopped, tears were running down her cheeks.    \"What is music, after all,\" she said, looking full into the face of her  teacher, \"when you are far from the land you love? How can you stand  music then? No, I don't mean to learn _music_ at the Great Shirley  School; I can't. When I am back again at home I shall play 'The Harp  that once through Tara's Halls,' but I can't do it justice here. You  will excuse me; I can't. I am sorry if I am rude, but it isn't in me.  Some time, if you have a headache and feel very bad, as my dear father  does sometimes, I shall play to you; but I can't learn as the other  girls learn--it isn't in me.\"    Again she put her fingers on the keys of the piano and brought forth a  few sobbing, broken-hearted notes. Then she started up.    \"I expect you will punish me for this, Miss Spicer, but I am sorry--I  can't help myself.\"    Strange to say, Miss Spicer did not punish her. On the contrary, she  took her hand and pressed it.    \"I won't ask you to do any more to-day,\" she said. \"I see you are not  like others. I will talk the matter over with you to-morrow.\"    \"And you will find me unchanged,\" said Kathleen. \"Thank you, all the  same, for your forbearance.\"          CHAPTER VI.    THE POOR TIRED ONE.      Mrs. Tennant spent the afternoon out shopping. She told the girls at  dinner that she would be home for tea, that she expected to be rather  tired, and hoped that they would be as good as possible. The boys were  always out during the afternoon, and as a rule never returned until  after tea; but Alice and Kathleen were expected to be in for this meal.  When Mrs. Tennant walked down the street, Kathleen went to the window  and looked after her.    \"What are you going to do this afternoon?\" said Alice, who was lying  back in an easy-chair with an open novel in her hand.    \"I don't know,\" replied Kathleen. \"What a dull hole this is! How can you  have grown up and kept well in a place like this?\"    \"Opinions differ with regard to its dullness,\" said Alice. \"I think our  home a very pleasant, entertaining place. I wouldn't live in your wild  castle for all you could give me.\"    \"Nobody asked you, my dear,\" said Kathleen, with a saucy nod of her  head.    She left the room and went up to what she called her half of the bedroom  on the next floor. She knelt down by the window and looked across over  the ugly landscape. There were houses everywhere--not a scrap of real  country, as she expressed it, to be found. She took out of her pocket  the letter which the foundation girls had sent her, and opened and read  it.    \"The old quarry! I wonder where the old quarry is,\" she thought. \"It  must be a good way from here. We have such a place at home, too. I did  not suppose one was to be found in this horrid part of the world. I am  rather glad there is an old quarry; it was quite nice of little Susy to  suggest it, and she will meet me, the little colleen. That is good. What  fun! I shall probably have to return through the bedroom window, so I  may as well explore and make all in readiness. Dear, dear! I should like  David to help me. It isn't the naughtiness that I care about, but it is  the fun of being naughty; it is the fun of having a sort of dangerous  thing to do. That is the real joy of it. It is the ecstacy of shocking  the prim Alice! Oh! there is her step. She's coming up, the creature!  Now then, I had best be as mum as I can unless I want to distract the  poor thing entirely.\"    Alice entered the room.    \"Do you greatly object to shutting the window?\" she said to Kathleen. \"I  have a slight cold, and the draught will make it worse.\"    \"Why, then, of course, darling,\" said Kathleen in a hearty voice, as she  brought down the window with a bang. \"Would you like me to shut the  ventilator in the grate?\" she then asked.    \"No. How silly you are!\"    \"Is it silly? I thought you had a cold. You are afraid of the draughts.  Why are you going out?\"    \"I want to see a school friend.\"    \"You will be back in time for tea, won't you?\"    \"Can't say.\"    \"But your mother, the poor tired one, asked you to be back.\"    \"I do wish, Kathleen, that you wouldn't call mother by that ridiculous  name. She is no more tired than--than other women are.\"    \"If that is the case,\" said Kathleen, \"I heartily hope that I shall not  live to be a woman. I wouldn't like us all to be as fagged as she  is--poor, dear, gentle soul! She's overworked, and that's the truth.\"    Kathleen saw that she was annoying Alice, and proceeded with great gusto  to expand her theory with regard to Mrs. Tennant.    \"She's in the condition when she might drop any time,\" she said. \"We  have had old Irishwomen overworked like that, and all of a sudden they  went out like snuffs: that is what happens. What are you putting on your  best hat for?\"    \"That is no affair of yours.\"    \"Oh, hoity-toity, how grand we are! Do you know, Alice, you haven't got  at all nice manners. You think you have, but you haven't. We are never  rude like that in Ireland. We tell a few lies now and then, but they are  only _polite_ lies--the kind that make other people happy. Alice, I  should like to know which is best--to be horribly cross, or to tell nice  polite lies. Which is the most wicked? I should like to know.\"    \"Then I will tell you,\" said Alice. \"What you call a nice lie is just a  very great and awful sin; and if you don't believe me, go to church and  listen when the commandments are read.\"    \"In future,\" said Kathleen very calmly, \"now that I really know your  views, I will always tell you _home truths_. You can't blame me, can  you?\"    Alice deigned no answer. She went downstairs and let herself out of the  house.    \"And that is the sort of girl I have exchanged for daddy and the mother  and the boys,\" thought the Irish girl. \"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\"    Kathleen flew downstairs. It was nearly three o'clock; tea was to be on  the table at half-past four. Quick as thought she dashed into the  kitchen.    \"Maria,\" she said, \"and cook, is there anything nice and tasty for tea  this evening?\"    \"Nice and tasty, miss!\" said cook. \"And what should there be nice and  tasty? There's bread, and there's butter--Dorset, second-class  Dorset--and there's jam (if there's any left); and that's about all.\"    \"That sort of tea isn't very nourishing, cook, is it? I ask because I  want to know,\" said Kathleen.    \"It's the kind we always have at Myrtle Lodge,\" replied cook. \"I don't  hold with it, but then it's the way of the missis.\"    \"I have got some money in my pocket,\" said Kathleen. \"I want to have a  beautiful, nice tea. Can't you think of something to buy? Here's five  shillings. Would that get her a nice tea?\"    \"A nice tea!\" cried Maria. \"It would get a beautiful meal; and the poor  missis, she would like it.\"    \"Then go out, Maria; do, like a darling. I will open the door for you if  anybody calls. Do run round the corner and bring in--Oh! I know what.  We'll have sausages--they are delicious--and a little tin of  sardines--won't they be good?--and some water-cress, and some  shrimps--oh, yes, shrimps! Be quick! And we will put out the best  tea-things, and a clean cloth; and it will rest the poor tired one so  tremendously when she comes in and sees a good meal on the table.\"    Both cook and Maria were quite excited. Perhaps they had an eye to the  reversion of the tea, the sausages, the sardines, the shrimps, and the  water-cress.    Maria went out, and Kathleen stood in the hall. Two or three people  arrived during Maria's absence, and Kathleen went promptly to the door  and said, \"Not at home, ma'am,\" in a determined voice, and with rather a  scowling face, to these arrivals. Some of the visitors left rather  important messages, but Kathleen did not remember them for more than a  moment after they were delivered. Maria presently came back"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15868"],[0,"The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales (#12)"],[1," I was sometimes permitted to contribute to the  journal. In memory of those early days of authorship, I select \"The  South American Editor\" to publish here. For the benefit of the New York  Observer, I will state that the story is not true. And lest any should  complain that it advocates elopements, I beg to observe, in the  seriousness of mature life, that the proposed elopement did not succeed,  and that the parties who proposed it are represented as having no  guardians or keepers but themselves. The article was first published in  1842.]           *       *       *       *       *    It is now more than six years since I received the following letter from  an old classmate of mine, Harry Barry, who had been studying divinity,  and was then a settled minister. It was an answer to a communication I  had sent him the week before.        \"TOPSHAM, R.I. January 22, 1836.        \"To say the truth, my dear George, your letter startled me a      little. To think that I, scarcely six months settled in the      profession, should be admitted so far into the romance of it as to      unite forever two young runaways like yourself and Miss Julia      What's-her-name is at least curious. But, to give you your due,      you have made a strong case of it, and as Miss ---- (what is her      name, I have not yours at hand) is not under any real      guardianship, I do not see but I am perfectly justified in      complying with your rather odd request. You see I make a      conscientious matter of it.        \"Write me word when it shall be, and I will be sure to be ready.      Jane is of course in my counsels, and she will make your little      wife feel as much at home as in her father's parlor. Trust us for      secrecy.        \"I met her last week--\"    But the rest of the letter has nothing to do with the story.    The elopement alluded to in it (if the little transaction deserves so  high-sounding a name) was, in every sense of the words, strictly  necessary. Julia Wentworth had resided for years with her grandfather, a  pragmatic old gentleman, to whom from pure affection she had long  yielded an obedience which he would have had no right to extort, and  which he was sometimes disposed to abuse. He had declared in the most  ingenuous manner that she should never marry with his consent any man of  less fortune than her own would be; and on his consent rested the  prospect of her inheriting his property.    Julia and I, however, care little for money now, we cared still less  then; and her own little property and my own little salary made us  esteem ourselves entirely independent of the old gentleman and his will.    His intention respecting the poor girl's marriage was thundered in her  ears at least once a week, so that we both knew that I had no need to  make court to him, indeed, I had never seen him, always having met her  in walking, or in the evening at party, spectacle, concert, or lecture.  He had lately been more domineering than usual, and I had but little  difficulty in persuading the dear girl to let me write to Harry Barry,  to make the arrangement to which he assented in the letter which I have  copied above. The reasoning which I pressed upon her is obvious. We  loved each other,--the old gentleman could not help that; and as he  managed to make us very uncomfortable in Boston, in the existing state  of affairs, we naturally came to the conclusion that the sooner we  changed that state the better. Our excursion to Topsham would, we  supposed, prove a very disagreeable business to him; but we knew it  would result very agreeably for us, and so, though with a good deal of  maidenly compunction and granddaughterly compassion on Julia's part, we  outvoted him.    I have said that I had no fortune to enable me to come near the old  gentleman's _beau ideal_ of a grandson-in-law. I was then living on my  salary as a South American editor. Does the reader know what that is?  The South American editor of a newspaper has the uncontrolled charge of  its South American news. Read any important commercial paper for a  month, and at the end of it tell me if you have any clear conception of  the condition of the various republics (!) of South America. If you  have, it is because that journal employs an individual for the sole  purpose of setting them in the clearest order before you, and that  individual is its South American editor. The general-news editor of the  paper will keep the run of all the details of all the histories of all  the rest of the world, but he hardly attempts this in addition. If he  does, he fails. It is therefore necessary, from the most cogent reasons,  that any American news office which has a strong regard for the  consistency or truth of its South American intelligence shall employ  some person competent to take the charge which I held in the  establishment of the Boston Daily Argus at the time of which I am  speaking. Before that enterprising paper was sold, I was its \"South  American man\"; this being my only employment, excepting that by a  special agreement, in consideration of an addition to my salary, I was  engaged to attend to the news from St. Domingo, Guatemala, and  Mexico.[F]    Monday afternoon, just a fortnight after I received Harry Barry's  letter, in taking my afternoon walk round the Common, I happened to meet  Julia. I always walked in the same direction when I was alone. Julia  always preferred to go the other way; it was the only thing in which we  differed. When we were together I always went her way of course, and  liked it best.    I had told her, long before, all about Harry's letter, and the dear girl  in this walk, after a little blushing and sighing, and half faltering  and half hesitating and feeling uncertain, yielded to my last and  warmest persuasions, and agreed to go to Mrs. Pollexfen's ball that  evening, ready to leave it with me in my buggy sleigh, for a three  hours' ride to Topsham, where we both knew Harry would be waiting for  us. I do not know how she managed to get through tea that evening with  her lion of a grandfather, for she could not then cover her tearful eyes  with a veil as she did through the last half of our walk together. I  know that I got through my tea and such like ordinary affairs by  skipping them. I made all my arrangements, bade Gage and Streeter be  ready with the sleigh at my lodgings (fortunately only two doors from  Mrs. Pollexfen's) at half-past nine o'clock, and was the highest  spirited of men when, on returning to those lodgings myself at eight  o'clock, I found the following missives from the Argus office, which had  been accumulating through the afternoon.        No. 1.        \"4 o'clock, P.M.        \"DEAR SIR:--The southern mail, just in, brings Buenos Ayres papers      six days later, by the Medora, at Baltimore.        \"In haste, J.C.\"    (Mr. C. was the gentleman who opened the newspapers, and arranged the  deaths and marriages; he always kindly sent for me when I was out of the  way.)        No. 2.        \"5 o'clock, P.M.        \"DEAR SIR:--The U.S. ship Preble is in at Portsmouth; latest from      Valparaiso. The mail is not sorted.        \"Yours, J.D.\"    (Mr. D. arranged the ship news for the Argus.)        No. 3.        \"6 o'clock, p.m.        \"DEAR SIR:--I boarded, this morning, off Cape Cod, the      Blunderhead, from Carthagena, and have a week's later papers.        \"Truly yours, J.E.\"    (Mr. E. was the enterprising commodore of our news-boats.)        No. 4.        \"6-1/4 o'clock, P.M.        \"DEAR SIR:--I have just opened accidentally the enclosed letter,      from our correspondent at Panama. You will see that it bears a New      Orleans post-mark. I hope it may prove exclusive.        \"Yours, J.F.\"    (Mr. F. was general editor of the Argus.)        No. 5.        \"6-1/2 o'clock, P.M.        \"DEAR SIR:--A seaman, who appears to be an intelligent man, has      arrived this morning at New Bedford, and says he has later news of      the rebellion in Ecuador than any published. The Rosina (his      vessel) brought no papers. I bade him call at your room at eight      o'clock, which he promised to do.        \"Truly yours, J.G.\"    (Mr. G. was clerk in the Argus counting-room.)        No 6.        \"7-1/2 o'clock, P.M.        \"Dear Sir:--The papers by the Ville de Lyon, from Havre, which I      have just received, mention the reported escape of M. Bonpland      from Paraguay, the presumed death of Dr. Francia, the probable      overthrow of the government, the possible establishment of a      republic, and a great deal more than I understand in the least.        \"These papers had not come to hand when I wrote you this      afternoon. I have left them on your desk at the office.        \"In haste, J.F.\"    I was taken all aback by this mass of odd-looking little notes. I had  spent the afternoon in drilling Singelton, the kindest of friends, as to  what he should do in any probable contingency of news of the next  forty-eight hours, for I did not intend to be absent on a wedding tour  even longer than that time; but I felt that Singleton was entirely  unequal to such a storm of intelligence as this; and, as I hurried down  to the office, my chief sensation was that of gratitude that the cloud  had broken before I was out of the way; for I knew I could do a great  deal in an hour, and I had faith that I might slur over my digest as  quickly as possible, and be at Mrs. Pollexfen's within the time  arranged.    I rushed into the office in that state of zeal in which a man may do  anything in almost no time. But first, I had to go into the  conversation-room, and get the oral news from my sailor; then Mr. H.;  from one of the little news-boats, came to me in high glee, with some  Venezuela Gazettes, which he had just extorted from a skipper, who, with  great plausibility, told him that he knew his vessel had brought no  news, for she never had before.
