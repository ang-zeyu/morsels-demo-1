Deliberatur de Avarico in communi  concilio, incendi placeret an defendi. Procumbunt omnibus Gallis ad  pedes Bituriges, ne pulcherrimam prope totius Galliae urbem, quae  praesidio et ornamento sit civitati, suis manibus succendere cogerentur:  facile se loci natura defensuros dicunt, quod prope ex omnibus partibus  flumine et palude circumdata unum habeat et perangustum aditum. Datur  petentibus venia dissuadente primo Vercingetorige, post concedente et  precibus ipsorum et misericordia vulgi. Defensores oppido idonei  deliguntur.      16    Vercingetorix minoribus Caesarem itineribus subsequitur et locum castris  deligit paludibus silvisque munitum ab Avarico longe milia passuum XVI.  Ibi per certos exploratores in singula diei tempora quae ad Avaricum  agerentur cognoscebat et quid fieri vellet imperabat. Omnes nostras  pabulationes frumentationesque observabat dispersosque, cum longius  necessario procederent, adoriebatur magnoque incommodo adficiebat, etsi,  quantum ratione provideri poterat, ab nostris occurrebatur, ut incertis  temporibus diversisque itineribus iretur.      17    Castris ad eam partem oppidi positis Caesar, quae intermissa [a] flumine  et a paludibus aditum, ut supra diximus, angustum habebat, aggerem  apparare, vineas agere, turres duas constituere coepit: nam  circumvallare loci natura prohibebat. De re frumentaria Boios atque  Aeduos adhortari non destitit; quorum alteri, quod nullo studio agebant,  non multum adiuvabant, alteri non magnis facultatibus, quod civitas erat  exigua et infirma, celeriter quod habuerunt consumpserunt. Summa  difficultate rei frumentariae adfecto exercitu tenuitate Boiorum,  indiligentia Aeduorum, incendiis aedificiorum, usque eo ut complures  dies frumento milites caruerint et pecore ex longinquioribus vicis  adacto extremam famem sustentarent, nulla tamen vox est ab eis audita  populi Romani maiestate et superioribus victoriis indigna. Quin etiam  Caesar cum in opere singulas legiones appellaret et, si acerbius inopiam  ferrent, se dimissurum oppugnationem diceret, universi ab eo, ne id  faceret, petebant: sic se complures anuos illo imperante meruisse, ut  nullam ignominiam acciperent, nusquam infecta re discederent: hoc se  ignominiae laturos loco, si inceptam oppugnationem reliquissent:  praestare omnes perferre acerbitates, quam non civibus Romanis, qui  Cenabi perfidia Gallorum interissent, parentarent. Haec eadem  centurionibus tribunisque militum mandabant, ut per eos ad Caesarem  deferrentur.      18    Cum iam muro turres appropinquassent, ex captivis Caesar cognovit  Vercingetorigem consumpto pabulo castra movisse propius Avaricum atque  ipsum cum equitatu expeditisque, qui inter equites proeliari  consuessent, insidiarum causa eo profectum, quo nostros postero die  pabulatum venturos arbitraretur. Quibus rebus cognitis media nocte  silentio profectus ad hostium castra mane pervenit. Illi celeriter per  exploratores adventu Caesaris cognito carros impedimentaque sua in  artiores silvas abdiderunt, copias omnes in loco edito atque aperto  instruxerunt. Qua re nuntiata Caesar celeriter sarcinas conferri, arma  expediri iussit.      19    Collis erat leniter ab infimo acclivis. Hunc ex omnibus fere partibus  palus difficilis atque impedita cingebat non latior pedibus  quinquaginta. Hoc se colle interruptis pontibus Galli fiducia loci  continebant generatimque distributi in civitates omnia vada ac saltus  eius paludis obtinebant sic animo parati, ut, si eam paludem Romani  perrumpere conarentur, haesitantes premerent ex loco superiore; ut qui  propinquitatem loci videret paratos prope aequo Marte ad dimicandum  existimaret, qui iniqui tatem condicionis perspiceret inani simulatione  sese ostentare cognosceret. Indignantes milites Gaesar, quod conspectum  suum hostes perferre possent tantulo spatio interiecto, et signum proeli  exposcentes edocet, quanto detrimento et quot virorum tortium morte  necesse sit constare victoriam; quos cum sic animo paratos videat, ut  nullum pro sua laude periculum recusent, summae se iniquitatis  condemnari debere, nisi eorum vitam sua salute habeat cariorem. Sic  milites consolatus eodem die reducit in castra reliquaque quae ad  oppugnationem pertinebant oppidi administrare instituit.      20    Vereingetorix, cum ad suos redisset, proditionis insimulatus, quod  castra propius Romanos movisset, quod cum omni equitatu discessisset,  quod sine imperio tantas copias reliquisset, quod eius discessu Romani  tanta opportunitate et celeritate venissent: non haec omnia fortuito aut  sine consilio accidere potuisse; regnum illum Galliae malle Caesaris  concessu quam ipsorum habere beneficio--tali modo accusatus ad haec  respondit: Quod castra movisset, factum inopia pabuli etiam ipsis  hortantibus; quod propius Romanos accessisset, persuasum loci  opportunitate, qui se ipsum munitione defenderet: equitum vero operam  neque in loco palustri desiderari debuisse et illic fuisse utilem, quo  sint profecti. Summam imperi se consulto nulli discedentem tradidisse,  ne is multitudinis studio ad dimicandum impelleretur; cui rei propter  animi mollitiem studere omnes videret, quod diutius laborem ferre non  possent. Romani si casu intervenerint, fortunae, si alicuius indicio  vocati, huic habendam gratiam, quod et paucitatem eorum ex loco  superiore cognoscere et virtutem despicere potuerint, qui dimicare non  ausi turpiter se in castra receperint. Imperium se ab Caesare per  proditionem nullum desiderare, quod habere victoria posset, quae iam  esset sibi atque omnibus Gallis explorata: quin etiam ipsis remittere,  si sibi magis honorem tribuere, quam ab se salutem accipere videantur.  \"Haec ut intellegatis,\" inquit, \"a me sincere pronuntiari, audite  Romauos milites.\" Producit servos, quos in pabulatione paucis ante  diebus exceperat et fame vinculisque excruciaverat. Hi iam ante edocti  quae interrogati pronuntiarent, milites se esse legionarios dicunt; fame  et inopia adductos clam ex castris exisse, si quid frumenti aut pecoris  in agris reperire possent: simili omnem exercitum inopia premi, nec iam  vires sufficere cuiusquam nec ferre operis laborem posse: itaque  statuisse imperatorem, si nihil in oppugnatione oppidi profecissent,  triduo exercitum deducere. \"Haec,\" inquit, \"a me,\" Vercingetorix,  \"beneficia habetis, quem proditionis insimulatis; cuius opera sine  vestro sanguine tantum exercitum victorem fame consumptum videtis; quem  turpiter se ex fuga recipientem ne qua civitas suis finibus recipiat a  me provisum est.\"      21    Conclamat omnis multitudo et suo more armis concrepat, quod facere in eo  consuerunt cuius orationem approbant: summum esse Vercingetorigem ducem,  nec de eius fide dubitandum, nec maiore ratione bellum administrari  posse. Statuunt, ut X milia hominum delecta ex omnibus copiis in oppidum  mittantur, nec solis Biturigibus communem salutem committendam censent,  quod paene in eo, si id oppidum retinuissent, summam victoriae constare  intellegebant.      22    Singulari militum nostrorum virtuti consilia cuius que modi Gallorum  occurrebant, ut est summae genus sollertiae atque ad omnia imitanda et  efficienda, quae ab quoque traduntur, aptissimum. Nam et laqueis falces  avertebant, quas, cum destinaverant, tormentis introrsus reducebant, et  aggerem cuniculis subtrahebant, eo scientius quod apud eos magnae sunt  ferrariae atque omne genus cuniculorum notum atque usitatum est. Totum  autem murum ex omni parte turribus contabulaverant atque has coriis  intexerant. Tum crebris diurnis nocturnisque eruptionibus aut aggeri  ignem inferebant aut milites occupatos in opere adoriebantur, et  nostrarum turrium altitudinem, quantum has cotidianus agger expresserat,  commissis suarum turrium malis adaequabant, et apertos cuniculos  praeusta et praeacuta materia et pice fervefacta et maximi ponderis  saxis morabantur moenibusque appropinquare prohibebant.      23    Muri autem omnes Gallici hac fere forma sunt. Trabes derectae perpetuae  in longitudinem paribus iutervallis, distantes inter se binos pedes, in  solo collocantur. Hae revinciuntur introrsus et multo aggere vestiuntur:  ea autem, quae diximus, inter valla grandibus in fronte saxis  effarciuntur. His collocatis et coagmentatis alius insuper ordo additur,  ut idem illud intervallum servetur neque inter se contingaut trabes, sed  paribus intermissae spatiis singulae singulis saxis interiectis arte  contineantur. Sic deinceps omne opus contexitur, dum iusta muri altitudo  expleatur. Hoc cum in speciem varietatemque opus deforme non est  alternis trabibus ac saxis, quae rectis lineis suos ordines servant, tum  ad utilitatem et defensionem urbium summam habet opportunitatem, quod et  ab incendio lapis et ab ariete materia defendit, quae perpetuis trabibus  pedes quadragenos plerumque introrsus revincta neque perrumpi neque  distrahi potest.      24    His tot rebus impedita oppugnatione milites, cum toto tempore frigore et  assiduis imbribus tardarentur, tamen continenti labore omnia haec  superaverunt et diebus XXV aggerem latum pedes CCCXXX, altum pedes LXXX  exstruxerunt. Cum is murum hostium paene contingeret, et Caesar ad opus  consuetudine excubaret milites que hortaretur, ne quod omnino tempus ab  opere intermitteretur, paulo ante tertiam vigiliam est animadversum  fumare aggerem, quem cuniculo hostes succenderant, eodemque tempore toto  muro clamore sublato duabus portis ab utroque latere turrium eruptio  fiebat, alii faces atque aridam materiem de muro in aggerem eminus  iaciebant, picem reliquasque res, quibus ignis excitari potest,  fundebant, ut quo primum curreretur aut cui rei ferretur auxilium vix  ratio iniri posset.

They are too nervously or mentally sick to  be moved by logic, or to respond with customary grace to a request which  their reason is not awake to answer. All usual suggestions may fail of  effect. And for these few, in order that health may be at all assured,  even the discipline of force may be necessary. But the nurse must use  this only as a last resort, of course, and in accordance with the  doctor's orders, and then solely as treatment leading toward the ways of  health. Before turning to this final method she should clearly, firmly,  and kindly explain the principle of the discipline if the patient's mind  is at all capable of grasping it. In any case, force should be used only  as the surgeon uses his knife. It hurts, but only to help and to save;  and it is not called upon when other methods can secure the needed  results. But force, thus limited in its application, may prove the only  suggestion which will bring about the action necessary to health on the  part of the patient. Force unwisely and unkindly used proves a damaging  suggestion, causing reactions of fear or anger; or it may lead to  delusions of persecution and to strengthened resistance.    Many suggestions come to the patient from within. Discomfort in the  right side may suggest appendicitis. A slight indigestion, often purely  nervous, may be interpreted as inability to care for certain diet, etc.  The wise nurse will displace as many of these as she can by casual  suggestions on her own part. She will demand of herself that her very  presence be quieting, calming, happy; that her conversation with her  patient shall vibrate with a certain something that gives him courage  and strengthens the desire and the will to health; that her care of him  shall prove confidence-breeding. The patient's attitude, when he is at  all suggestible, is largely in the nurse's hands, and she can make his  illness a calamity by dishonest, fear-breeding, or suspicion-forming  suggestion. After all, the whole question here is one of the normality  of the nurse's own outlook on life and people. The happier, truer, and  more wholesome it is, the more really can she help her patient to both  bodily and mental health. Of one thing let the overzealous nurse beware.  Do not irritate your patient by a patent, blatant, hollow cheerfulness  that any one of any sense knows is assumed for his benefit. Personally I  know of no more aggravating stimulus.    _What We Attend To Determines What We Are._--This is one of the first  laws of education. If the child's attention from birth could be  controlled, his future would be absolutely assured. But attention is a  thing of free will and cannot be forced by others. It can be won through  interest or self-directed by will. The child's attention is entirely  determined by interest, interest in the morbid and painful as truly as  in the bright and happy. Punishment interests him tremendously because  it affects him, it interferes with his plan of life, it holds his entire  immediate attention to his injured self. But something more impelling  quickly makes him forget his hurt feelings and he is happy again. The  average sick person is emotionally very much like the child. His will at  the time, as we noted before, is tempted to take a rest, and his  interest is ready to follow bodily feeling unless something more  impelling is offered. The nurse who can direct attention to other  people, to analyzing the sounds of the street, to understanding  something of the new life of a hospital or sick room, to planning a  house, or choosing its furniture or equipping a library, or supplying a  store; to intelligent references to books or current events; or to  redecorating the room--all in his mind; to an appetizing tray, a dainty  flower, a bit of sunshine, a picture, etc., is fixing the patient's  attention on something constructive, helping him to get well by  forgetting to think of himself.    Thus the nurse, knowing the laws of attention, can keep herself alert to  divert and direct her patient's thought to wholesome interests. Knowing  the possibility of thought substitution, she can open up new channels  of thinking. Knowing the power of the will to assist in health bringing  and health keeping, she can sometimes stimulate long-dormant  determination. Let her beware, however, of making the convalescent too  dependent upon help from without, but prick his pride to gradually  increasing doing for himself. Arouse his reasonable ambition, but let  him realize that life must be taken up again a step at a time; and that  he _can_ do it. If limitations must be accepted, try to inspire the  feeling of pride in accomplishing the utmost possible within a  limitation, and an acceptance of the inevitable without bitterness.    Attending to the unhappy, the painful, the boring without looking beyond  makes life unhappy, painful, and a bore. Not that the nurse should  ignore these realities, but she can accept them whole-souledly herself  as not the final things, as merely the rocks that can be used to stand  upon and get a view of the something better for everybody. When they are  thus used by the wholesome mind, facts, the very barest and meanest of  them, can be made useful as stepping-stones to the happier facts beyond  them.    If the nurse can direct or tactfully lead the patient's attention away  from himself and his illness, she has found a big reinforcement to his  treatment. This question is so vital in the care of patients that it  will be discussed at greater length later on.      ONE THOUGHT CAN BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER    If we control attention we control thought, and with the suggestible  patient this principle depends upon the one just now considered. Hope  and courage-breeding thoughts can replace despairing and fearful ones,  but it will be only when attention is directed through interest or by  will to new material. There is no blank in waking consciousness. The  last thought or feeling or perception, through association of ideas,  brings up a related one, and so on indefinitely. We may start with a  pebble on the road and go on logically, smoothly, until in five minutes  we are thinking of the coronation of King George, with no sense of  anything at all unusual in the succession. It may be a very roundabout  process, from \"pebble\" through \"rough way,\" \"ways that hurt,\" \"dangerous  ways,\" \"brigands,\" \"uncertainties of life.\" \"Uncertain lies the head  that wears a crown,\" \"King George and his crown,\" \"coronation.\" But this  constant stream of thought can be broken into at any point by a spoken  word, a passing vehicle, which diverts the mind's trend. So the nurse  can take advantage of the mind's very suggestibility, and substitute for  the unhappy and sickness breeding by turning attention to anything else  of a happier color, and may divert the entire stream of thought in that  direction. She who knows these simple laws of the mind, and who at all  knows people, is a therapeutic agent of unlimited value.      HABIT IS A CONSERVER OF EFFORT    It is always easier to follow a beaten path than to break one's way  through untrodden forests. It is easier to walk after we \"learn how,\"  and learning how is simply doing it over and over until the legs and  feet have acquired habits of motion and accommodation to distances and  to what is underfoot. It is easy to do anything after we have done it  again and again, so that it has become second-nature, and  \"second-nature\" is habit. The wise man early forms certain habits of  personal care, of eating, sleeping, exercising; of study, of meeting the  usual occurrences of life. The first day he spent at anything new was a  hard one. Nothing was done naturally. Active attention had to be keenly  held to each detail. He had to learn where things belonged, how to do  this and that for the first time, how to work with his associates.    Do you remember the first hospital bed you ever made, the first bed-bath  you gave, the first massage? You had to be taught bit by bit, detail by  detail. You did not look upon the finished whole, but gave almost  painful attention to each step that led to the made bed, the completed  bath, or the given massage. Your fingers were probably all thumbs unless  you had experience in such things before you came to the hospital. Your  mind was tired from the strain of trying to remember each suggestion of  your instructor. The second time, or certainly the third or fourth time,  it went better. After a week of daily experience you gave the bath or  massage or made the bed with much less effort. A month later the work  was practically automatic and accomplished in a fraction of the time you  spent on it that first day. Now you can do it quickly and well with  little conscious thought; and at the same time carry on a brisk  conversation with your patient or think out your work for the day. Your  mind is free for other thoughts while you perform the task easily and  perfectly. Your method of doing the work has finally become a habit  which saves the effort of conscious attention. The details of your  routine work are directed by the subconscious. The habit will be energy  and time saving in proportion to the accuracy of your first conscious  efforts spent on the new undertaking. Thus, useful habit is the result  of active effort.    We can acquire habits of thinking and habits of feeling as well as  habits of doing.    But the other habits, the bad ones, are not acquired with effort. We  fall into them. Hazy thinking is easier than clear thinking. Suppose you  are by nature rather oversanguine or overdespondent, and you make no  genuine attempt to evolve that nature into poise."]]]
