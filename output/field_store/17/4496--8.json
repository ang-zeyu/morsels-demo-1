We  must have the garden searched thoroughly by daylight.\"    \"_He_\"--Weymouth glanced at that which lay upon the floor--\"must be  moved; but otherwise we can leave the place untouched, clear out the  servants, and lock the house up!\"    \"I have already given orders to that effect,\" answered Smith. He spoke  wearily and with a note of conscious defeat in his voice. \"Nothing has  been disturbed\"--he swept his arm around comprehensively--\"papers and  so forth you can examine at leisure.\"    Presently we quitted that house upon which the fateful Chinaman had  set his seal, as the suburb was awakening to a new day. The clank of  milk-cans was my final impression of the avenue to which a dreadful  minister of death had come at the bidding of the death lord. We left  Inspector Weymouth in charge and returned to my rooms, scarcely  exchanging a word upon the way.    Nayland Smith, ignoring my entreaties, composed himself for slumber in  the white cane chair in my study. About noon he retired to the  bath-room and, returning, made a pretence to breakfast; then resumed  his seat in the cane armchair. Carter reported in the afternoon, but  his report was merely formal. Returning from my round of professional  visits at half-past five, I found Nayland Smith in the same position;  and so the day waned into evening, and dusk fell uneventfully.    In the corner of the big room by the empty fireplace, Nayland Smith  lay, his long, lean frame extended in the white cane chair. A tumbler,  from which two straws protruded, stood by his right elbow, and a  perfect continent of tobacco smoke lay between us, wafted towards the  door by the draught from an open window. He had littered the hearth  with matches and tobacco ash, being the most untidy smoker I had ever  met; and save for his frequent rappings out of his pipe bowl and  perpetual striking of matches, he had shown no sign of activity for  the past hour. Collarless and wearing an old tweed jacket, he had  spent the evening, as he had spent the day, in the cane chair, only  quitting it for some ten minutes, or less, to toy with dinner.    My several attempts at conversation had elicited nothing but growls;  therefore, as dusk descended, having dismissed my few patients, I  busied myself collating my notes upon the renewed activity of the  Yellow Doctor, and was thus engaged when the 'phone bell disturbed me.  It was Smith who was wanted, however; and he went out eagerly, leaving  me to my task.    At the end of a lengthy conversation, he returned from the 'phone and  began, restlessly, to pace the room. I made a pretence of continuing  my labours, but covertly I was watching him. He was twitching at the  lobe of his left ear, and his face was a study in perplexity. Abruptly  he burst out:    \"I shall throw the thing up, Petrie! Either I am growing too old to  cope with such an adversary as Fu-Manchu, or else my intellect has  become dull. I cannot seem to think clearly or consistently. For the  Doctor, this crime, this removal of Slattin, is clumsy--unfinished.  There are two explanations. Either he, too, is losing his old  cunning, or he has been interrupted!\"    \"Interrupted!\"    \"Take the facts, Petrie.\" Smith clapped his hands upon my table and  bent down, peering into my eyes. \"Is it characteristic of Fu-Manchu to  kill a man by the direct agency of a snake and to implicate one of his  own damnable servants in this way?\"    \"But we have found no snake!\"    \"Karamaneh introduced one in some way. Do you doubt it?\"    \"Certainly Karamaneh visited him on the evening of his death, but you  must be perfectly well aware that even if she had been arrested, no  jury could convict her.\"    Smith resumed his restless pacings up and down.    \"You are very useful to me, Petrie,\" he rapped; \"as a counsel for the  defence you constantly rectify my errors of prejudice. Yet I am  convinced that our presence at Slattin's house last night prevented  Fu-Manchu from finishing off this little matter as he had designed to  do.\"    \"What has given you this idea?\"    \"Weymouth is responsible. He has rung me up from the Yard. The  constable on duty at the house where the murder was committed, reports  that some one, less than an hour ago, attempted to break in.\"    \"Break in!\"    \"Ah! you are interested? _I_ thought the circumstance illuminating,  also!\"    \"Did the officer see this person?\"    \"No; he only heard him. It was some one who endeavoured to enter by  the bath-room window, which, I am told, may be reached fairly easily  by an agile climber.\"    \"The attempt did not succeed?\"    \"No; the constable interrupted, but failed to make a capture or even  to secure a glimpse of the man.\"    We were both silent for some moments; then--    \"What do you propose to do?\" I asked.    \"We must not let Fu-Manchu's servants know,\" replied Smith, \"but  to-night I shall conceal myself in Slattin's house and remain there  for a week or a day--it matters not how long--until that attempt is  repeated. Quite obviously, Petrie, we have overlooked something which  implicates the murderer with the murder! In short, either by accident,  by reason of our superior vigilance, or by the clumsiness of his  plans, Fu-Manchu for once in an otherwise blameless career has left a  _clue_!\"          CHAPTER X    THE CLIMBER RETURNS      In utter darkness we groped our way through into the hall of Slattin's  house, having entered, stealthily, from the rear; for Smith had  selected the study as a suitable base of operations. We reached it  without mishap, and presently I found myself seated in the very chair  which Karamaneh had occupied; my companion took up a post just within  the widely opened door.    So we commenced our ghostly business in the house of the murdered  man--a house from which, but a few hours since, his body had been  removed. This was such a vigil as I had endured once before, when,  with Nayland Smith and another, I had waited for the coming of one of  Fu-Manchu's death agents.    Of all the sounds which one by one now began to detach themselves from  the silence, there was a particular sound, homely enough at another  time, which spoke to me more dreadfully than the rest. It was the  ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece; and I thought how this  sound must have been familiar to Abel Slattin, how it must have formed  part and parcel of his life, as it were, and how it went on  now--_tick_-_tick_-_tick_-_tick_--whilst he, for whom it had ticked,  lay unheeding--would never heed it more.    As I grew more accustomed to the gloom, I found myself staring at the  office chair; once I found myself expecting Abel Slattin to enter the  room and occupy it. There was a little China Buddha upon a bureau in  one corner, with a gilded cap upon its head, and as some reflection of  the moonlight sought out this little cap, my thoughts grotesquely  turned upon the murdered man's gold tooth.    Vague creakings from within the house, sounds as though of stealthy  footsteps upon the stairs, set my nerves tingling; but Nayland Smith gave  no sign, and I knew that my imagination was magnifying these ordinary night  sounds out of all proportion to their actual significance. Leaves rustled  faintly outside the window at my back: I construed their sibilant whispers  into the dreaded name--_Fu-Manchu_--_Fu-Manchu_--_Fu-Manchu_!    So wore on the night; and, when the ticking clock hollowly boomed the  hour of one, I almost leapt out of my chair, so highly strung were my  nerves, and so appallingly did the sudden clangour beat upon them.  Smith, like a man of stone, showed no sign. He was capable of so  subduing his constitutionally high-strung temperament, at times, that  temporarily he became immune from human dreads. On such occasion he  would be icily cool amid universal panic; but, his object  accomplished, I have seen him in such a state of collapse, that utter  nervous exhaustion is the only term by which I can describe it.    _Tick_-_tick_-_tick_-_tick_ went the clock, and, my heart still  thumping noisily in my breast, I began to count the tickings; _one_,  _two_, _three_, _four_, _five_, and so on to a hundred, and from one  hundred to many hundreds.    Then, out from the confusion of minor noises, a new, arresting sound  detached itself. I ceased my counting; no longer I noted the  _tick_-_tick_ of the clock, nor the vague creakings, rustlings and  whispers. I saw Smith, shadowly, raise his hand in warning--in  needless warning; for I was almost holding my breath in an effort of  acute listening.    From high up in the house this new sound came--from above the topmost  rooms, it seemed, up under the roof; a regular squeaking, oddly  familiar, yet elusive. Upon it followed a very soft and muffled thud;  then a metallic sound as of a rusty hinge in motion; then a new  silence, pregnant with a thousand possibilities more eerie than any  clamour.    My mind was rapidly at work. Lighting the topmost landing of the house  was a sort of glazed trap, evidently set in the floor of a loft-like  place extending over the entire building. Somewhere in the red-tiled  roof above, there presumably existed a corresponding skylight or  lantern.    So I argued; and, ere I had come to any proper decision, another  sound, more intimate, came to interrupt me.    This time I could be in no doubt; some one was lifting the trap above  the stairhead--slowly, cautiously, and all but silently. Yet to my  ears, attuned to trifling disturbances, the trap creaked and groaned  noisily.    Nayland Smith waved to me to take a stand on the other side of the  opened door--behind it, in fact, where I should be concealed from the  view of any one descending the stair.    I stood up and crossed the floor to my new post.    A dull thud told of the trap fully raised and resting upon some  supporting joist. A faint rustling (of discarded garments, I told  myself) spoke to my newly awakened, acute perceptions, of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#12)"],[1,"stripped off their sodden clothing and  hung it to dry. Ross wrapped a bird he had shot in clay and tucked it  under the hot coals to be roasted.    They had surely had bad luck, he thought, but they were now undercover,  had a fire, and food of a sort. His arm ached, sharp pain shooting from  fingers to elbow when he moved it. Though Ashe made no complaint, Ross  gauged that the older man's discomfort was far worse than his own, and  he carefully hid all signs of his own twinges.    They ate the bird, saltless, and with their fingers. Ross savored each  greasy bite, licking his hands clean afterward while Ashe lay back on  the improvised bed, his face gaunt in the half light of the fire.    \"We are about five miles from the sea here. There is no way of raising  our base now that Sandy's installation is gone. I'll have to lay up,  since I can't risk any more loss of blood. And you're not too good in  the woods--\"    Ross accepted that valuation with a new humbleness. He was only too well  aware that if it had not been for Ashe, he and not the white wolf would  have died down in the valley. Yet a strange shyness kept him from trying  to put his thanks into words. The only kind of amends he could make for  the other's hurt was to provide hands, feet, and strength for the man  who did know what to do and how to do it.    \"We'll have to hunt--\" he ventured.    \"Deer,\" Ashe caught him up. \"But the marsh at the mouth of this stream  provides a better hunting ground than inland. If the wolf laired here  very long, she has already frightened away any large game. It isn't the  matter of food which bothers me----\"    \"It is being tied up here,\" Ross filled in for him with some daring.  \"But look here, I'll take orders. This is your territory, and I'm green  at the game. You tell me what to do, and I'll do it the best that I  can.\" He glanced up to find Ashe surveying him intently, but as usual  there was no readable expression on the other's brown face.    \"The first thing to do is get the wolf's hide,\" Ashe said briskly. \"Then  bury the carcass. You'd better drag it up here to work on it. If her  mate is hanging around, he might try to jump you.\"    Why Ashe should think it necessary to acquire the wolf skin puzzled  Ross, but he asked no questions. His skinning task took four times as  long and was far from being the neat job the shock-haired man of the  record tape had accomplished. Ross had to wash himself off in the stream  before piling stones over the corpse in temporary burial. When he pulled  his bloody burden back to the cave, Ashe lay with his eyes closed. Ross  thankfully sat on his own pile of bracken and tried not to notice the  throbbing ache in his arm.    He must have fallen asleep, for when he roused it was to see Ashe crawl  over to mend the dying fire from their store of wood. Ross, angry at  himself, beat the other to the task.    \"Get back,\" he said roughly. \"This is my job. I didn't mean to fail.\"    Surprisingly, Ashe settled back without a word, leaving Ross to sit by  the fire, a fire he was very glad to have a moment or so later when a  wailing howl sounded down-wind. If this was not the white wolf's mate,  then it was another of her kin who prowled the upper reaches of the  small valley.    The next day, having provided Ashe with a supply of firewood, Ross went  to try his luck in the marsh. The thick drizzle which had hung over the  land the day before was gone, and he faced a clear, bright morning,  though the breeze had an icy snap. But it was a good morning to be alive  and out in the open, and Ross's spirits rose.    He tried to put to use all the woodlore he had learned at the base. But  it was one thing to learn something academically and another to put that  learning into practice. He was uncomfortably certain that Ashe would not  have found his showing very good.    The marsh was a series of pools between rank growths of leafless willows  and coarse tufts of grass, with hillocks of firmer soil rising like  islands. Ross, approaching with caution, was glad of it, for from one of  those hillocks arose a trail of white smoke, and he saw a black blot  which was probably a rude hut. Why one should choose to live in the  midst of such country he could not guess, though it might be merely the  temporary camp of some hunter.    Ross also saw thousands of birds feeding greedily on the dried seed of  the marsh grasses, paddling in the pools, and setting up a clamor to  drive a man mad. They did not seem in the least disturbed by that  distant camper.    Ross had reason to be proud of his marksmanship that morning. He had in  his quiver perhaps half a dozen of the lighter shafts made for shooting  birds. In place of the finely chipped and wickedly barbed flint points  used for heavier game, these were tipped with needle-sharp, light bone  heads. He had a string of four birds looped together by their feet  within almost as many minutes. For the flocks rose in their first alarm  only to settle again to feast.    Then he knocked over a hare--a fat giant of its race--that stared at him  brazenly from a tussock. The hare kicked back into a pool in its death  struggle, however, and Ross was forced to leave cover to retrieve its  body. But he was alert and he stood up, dagger out and ready, to greet  the man who parted the bushes to watch him.    For a long minute gray eyes stared into brown ones, and then Ross noted  the other's bedraggled and tattered dress. The kilt-tunic smudged with  mud, scorched and charred along one edge, was styled like his own. The  fellow wore his hair fastened back with a band, unlike the topknot of  the local tribesman.    Ross, his dagger still ready, broke the silence first. \"I am a believer  in the fire and the fashioned metal, the climbing sun, and the moving  water.\" He repeated the recognition speech of the Beakermen.    \"The fire warms by the grace of Tulden, the metal is fashioned by the  mystery of the smith, the sun climbs without our aid, and who can stop  the water from running?\" The stranger's voice was hoarse. Now that Ross  had time to examine him more closely he saw the dark bruise on his  exposed shoulder, the raw red mark of a burn running across the man's  broad chest. He dared to test his surmise concerning the other.    \"I am of the kin of Assha. We returned to the hill----\"    \"Ashe!\"    Not \"Assha\" but \"Ashe!\" Ross, though sure of that pronunciation, was  still cautious. \"You are from the hill place, where Lurgha smote with  thunder and fire?\"    The man slid his long legs across the log which had been his shelter.  The burn across his chest was not his only brand, for Ross noticed  another red stripe, puffed and fiery looking, which swelled the calf of  one leg. The man studied Ross closely, and then his fingers moved in a  sign which to the uninitiated native might have been one for the warding  off of evil, but which to Ross was the \"thumbs up\" of his own age.    \"Sanford?\"    At that name the man shook his head. \"McNeil,\" he named himself. \"Where  is Ashe?\"    He might really be what he seemed, but on the other hand, he could be a  Red spy. Ross had not forgotten Kurt. \"What happened?\" he parried one  question with another.    \"Bomb. The Reds must have spotted us, and we didn't have a chance. We  weren't expecting any trouble. I'd been down to see about a missing  burden donkey and was about halfway back up the hill when she hit. When  I came to I was all the way down the hill with part of the fort on top  of me. The rest.... Well, you saw the place, didn't you?\"    Ross nodded. \"What are you doing here?\"    McNeil spread his hands in a tired little gesture. \"I tried to talk to  Nodren, but they stoned me away. I knew that Ashe was coming through and  hoped to reach him when he hit the beach, but I was too late. Then I  figured he would pass here to make contact with the sub, so I was  waiting it out until I saw you. Where is Ashe?\"    It all sounded logical enough. Still, with Ashe injured, Ross was taking  no chances. He pushed his dagger back into its sheath and picked up the  hare. \"Stay here,\" he told McNeil, \"I'll be back----\"    \"But--wait! Where's Ashe, you young fool? We have to get together.\"    Ross went on. He was sure that the stranger was in no shape to race  after him, and he would lay a muddled trail before he returned to the  cave valley. If this man was a Red plant, he would have to reckon with  one who had already met Kurt Vogel.    The laying of that muddled trail took time. It was past midday when Ross  came back to Ashe, who was sitting up by the mouth of the cave at the  fire, using his dagger to fashion a crutch out of a length of sapling.  He surveyed Ross's burden with approval, but lost interest in the  promise of food as soon as the other reported his meeting in the marsh.    \"McNeil--chap with brown hair, brown eyes, a right eyebrow which quirks  up toward his hairline when he smiles?\"    \"Brown hair and eyes, okay--and he didn't smile any.\"    \"Chip broken off a front tooth--upper right?\"    Ross shut his eyes to visualize the stranger. Yes, there had been a  small break on a front tooth. He nodded.    \"That's McNeil. Not that you didn't do right not to bring him here  without being sure. What made you so watchful? Kurt?\"    Again Ross nodded. \"And what you said about the Reds' planting someone  here to wait for us.\"    Ashe scratched the bristles on his chin. \"Never underrate them--we don't  dare do that. But the man you met is McNeil, and we'd better get him  here. Can you bring him?\"    \"I think he's able to get about, in spite of that leg. From his story  he's been stirring around.\"    Ashe bit absent-mindedly into a piece of hare and swore mildly when he  burned his tongue. \"Odd that Cassca didn't tell us about him. Unless she  thought there was no use causing trouble by admitting they had driven  him away. You going now?\"    Ross moved around the fire. \"Might as well. He didn't look too  comfortable. And"]]]
