Marina gladly obeyed, and sending the rest away, she sat and  sang to her poor grief-laden father, yet, sweet as was her voice, he  made no sign. So presently she spoke to him, saying that her grief might  equal his, for, though she was a slave, she came from ancestors that  stood equal to mighty kings.    Something in her voice and story touched the King's heart, and he looked  up at her, and as he looked, he saw with wonder how like she was to his  lost wife, so with a great hope springing up in his heart, he bade her  tell her story.    Then, with many interruptions from the King, she told him who she was  and how she had escaped from the cruel Dionyza. So Pericles knew that  this was indeed his daughter, and he kissed her again and again, crying  that his great seas of joy drowned him with their sweetness. \"Give me my  robes,\" he said: \"O Heaven, bless my girl!\"    Then there came to him, though none else could hear it, the sound of  heavenly music, and falling asleep, he beheld the goddess Diana, in a  vision.    \"Go,\" she said to him, \"to my temple at Ephesus, and when my maiden  priests are met together, reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.\"    Pericles obeyed the goddess and told his tale before her altar. Hardly  had he made an end, when the chief priestess, crying out, \"You are--you  are--O royal Pericles!\" fell fainting to the ground, and presently  recovering, she spoke again to him, \"O my lord, are you not Pericles?\"  \"The voice of dead Thaisa!\" exclaimed the King in wonder. \"That Thaisa  am I,\" she said, and looking at her he saw that she spoke the very  truth.    Thus Pericles and Thaisa, after long and bitter suffering, found  happiness once more, and in the joy of their meeting they forgot the  pain of the past. To Marina great happiness was given, and not only  in being restored to her dear parents; for she married Lysimachus, and  became a princess in the land where she had been sold as a slave.          HAMLET        Hamlet was the only son of the King of Denmark. He loved his father and  mother dearly--and was happy in the love of a sweet lady named Ophelia.  Her father, Polonius, was the King's Chamberlain.    While Hamlet was away studying at Wittenberg, his father died. Young  Hamlet hastened home in great grief to hear that a serpent had stung  the King, and that he was dead. The young Prince had loved his father so  tenderly that you may judge what he felt when he found that the Queen,  before yet the King had been laid in the ground a month, had determined  to marry again--and to marry the dead King's brother.    Hamlet refused to put off mourning for the wedding.    \"It is not only the black I wear on my body,\" he said, \"that proves my  loss. I wear mourning in my heart for my dead father. His son at least  remembers him, and grieves still.\"    Then said Claudius the King's brother, \"This grief is unreasonable. Of  course you must sorrow at the loss of your father, but--\"    \"Ah,\" said Hamlet, bitterly, \"I cannot in one little month forget those  I love.\"    With that the Queen and Claudius left him, to make merry over their  wedding, forgetting the poor good King who had been so kind to them  both.    And Hamlet, left alone, began to wonder and to question as to what he  ought to do. For he could not believe the story about the snake-bite.  It seemed to him all too plain that the wicked Claudius had killed the  King, so as to get the crown and marry the Queen. Yet he had no proof,  and could not accuse Claudius.    And while he was thus thinking came Horatio, a fellow student of his,  from Wittenberg.    \"What brought you here?\" asked Hamlet, when he had greeted his friend  kindly.    \"I came, my lord, to see your father's funeral.\"    \"I think it was to see my mother's wedding,\" said Hamlet, bitterly. \"My  father! We shall not look upon his like again.\"    \"My lord,\" answered Horatio, \"I think I saw him yesternight.\"    Then, while Hamlet listened in surprise, Horatio told how he, with two  gentlemen of the guard, had seen the King's ghost on the battlements.  Hamlet went that night, and true enough, at midnight, the ghost of the  King, in the armor he had been wont to wear, appeared on the battlements  in the chill moonlight. Hamlet was a brave youth. Instead of running  away from the ghost he spoke to it--and when it beckoned him he followed  it to a quiet place, and there the ghost told him that what he had  suspected was true. The wicked Claudius had indeed killed his good  brother the King, by dropping poison into his ear as he slept in his  orchard in the afternoon.    \"And you,\" said the ghost, \"must avenge this cruel murder-- on my wicked  brother. But do nothing against the Queen-- for I have loved her, and  she is your mother. Remember me.\"    Then seeing the morning approach, the ghost vanished.    \"Now,\" said Hamlet, \"there is nothing left but revenge. Remember thee--I  will remember nothing else--books, pleasure, youth--let all go--and your  commands alone live on my brain.\"    So when his friends came back he made them swear to keep the secret of  the ghost, and then went in from the battlements, now gray with mingled  dawn and moonlight, to think how he might best avenge his murdered  father.    The shock of seeing and hearing his father's ghost made him feel almost  mad, and for fear that his uncle might notice that he was not himself,  he determined to hide his mad longing for revenge under a pretended  madness in other matters.    And when he met Ophelia, who loved him--and to whom he had given gifts,  and letters, and many loving words--he behaved so wildly to her, that  she could not but think him mad. For she loved him so that she could not  believe he would be as cruel as this, unless he were quite mad. So she  told her father, and showed him a pretty letter from Hamlet. And in the  letter was much folly, and this pretty verse--           \"Doubt that the stars are fire;            Doubt that the sun doth move;          Doubt truth to be a liar;            But never doubt I love.\"    And from that time everyone believed that the cause of Hamlet's supposed  madness was love.    Poor Hamlet was very unhappy. He longed to obey his father's ghost--and  yet he was too gentle and kindly to wish to kill another man, even his  father's murderer. And sometimes he wondered whether, after all, the  ghost spoke truly.    Just at this time some actors came to the Court, and Hamlet ordered them  to perform a certain play before the King and Queen. Now, this play  was the story of a man who had been murdered in his garden by a near  relation, who afterwards married the dead man's wife.    You may imagine the feelings of the wicked King, as he sat on his  throne, with the Queen beside him and all his Court around, and saw,  acted on the stage, the very wickedness that he had himself done. And  when, in the play, the wicked relation poured poison into the ear of the  sleeping man, the wicked Claudius suddenly rose, and staggered from the  room--the Queen and others following.    Then said Hamlet to his friends--    \"Now I am sure the ghost spoke true. For if Claudius had not done this  murder, he could not have been so distressed to see it in a play.\"    Now the Queen sent for Hamlet, by the King's desire, to scold him  for his conduct during the play, and for other matters; and Claudius,  wishing to know exactly what happened, told old Polonius to hide himself  behind the hangings in the Queen's room. And as they talked, the Queen  got frightened at Hamlet's rough, strange words, and cried for help, and  Polonius behind the curtain cried out too. Hamlet, thinking it was the  King who was hidden there, thrust with his sword at the hangings, and  killed, not the King, but poor old Polonius.    So now Hamlet had offended his uncle and his mother, and by bad hap  killed his true love's father.    \"Oh! what a rash and bloody deed is this,\" cried the Queen.    And Hamlet answered bitterly, \"Almost as bad as to kill a king, and  marry his brother.\" Then Hamlet told the Queen plainly all his thoughts  and how he knew of the murder, and begged her, at least, to have no more  friendship or kindness of the base Claudius, who had killed the good  King. And as they spoke the King's ghost again appeared before Hamlet,  but the Queen could not see it. So when the ghost had gone, they parted.    When the Queen told Claudius what had passed, and how Polonius was dead,  he said, \"This shows plainly that Hamlet is mad, and since he has killed  the Chancellor, it is for his own safety that we must carry out our  plan, and send him away to England.\"    So Hamlet was sent, under charge of two courtiers who served the King,  and these bore letters to the English Court, requiring that Hamlet  should be put to death. But Hamlet had the good sense to get at these  letters, and put in others instead, with the names of the two courtiers  who were so ready to betray him. Then, as the vessel went to England,  Hamlet escaped on board a pirate ship, and the two wicked courtiers left  him to his fate, and went on to meet theirs.    Hamlet hurried home, but in the meantime a dreadful thing had happened.  Poor pretty Ophelia, having lost her lover and her father, lost her wits  too, and went in sad madness about the Court, with straws, and weeds,  and flowers in her hair, singing strange scraps of songs, and talking  poor, foolish, pretty talk with no heart of meaning to it. And one  day, coming to a stream where willows grew, she tried to bang a flowery  garland on a willow, and fell into the water with all her flowers, and  so died.    And Hamlet had loved her, though his plan of seeming madness had made  him hide it; and when he came back, he found the King and Queen, and the  Court, weeping at the funeral of his dear love and lady.    Ophelia's brother, Laertes, had also just come to Court to ask justice  for the death of his father, old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#12)"],[1,"taking up a position whence we may reach the ships with red-hot balls;  and we shall see if we are not masters of Toulon.\" But this very  letter disproves the Buonapartist claim. It was written on September  13th. Thus, _three days before Buonaparte's arrival_, the  Commissioners had fully decided on attacking the Little Gibraltar; and  the claim that Buonaparte originated the plan can only be sustained by  antedating his arrival at Toulon.[24] In fact, every experienced  officer among besiegers and besieged saw the weak point of the  defence: early in September Hood and Mulgrave began the fortification  of the heights behind L'Eguillette. In face of these facts, the  assertion that Buonaparte was the first to design the movements which  secured the surrender of Toulon must be relegated to the domain of  hero-worship. (See note on p. 56.)    [Illustration: THE SIEGE OF TOULON, 1793, from \"L'Histoire de France  depuis la Revolution de 1789,\" by Emmanuel Toulougeon. Paris, An. XII.  [1803]. A. Fort Mulgrave. A'.

Battery \"Hommes sans Peur.\" The black and shaded  rectangles are the Republican and Allied positions respectively.]    Carteaux having been superseded by Doppet, more energy was thrown  into the operations. Yet for him Buonaparte had scarcely more respect.  On November 15th an affair of outposts near Fort Mulgrave showed his  weakness. The soldiers on both sides eagerly took up the affray; line  after line of the French rushed up towards that frowning redoubt:  O'Hara, the leader of the allied troops, encouraged the British in a  sortie that drove back the blue-coats; whereupon Buonaparte headed the  rallying rush to the gorge of the redoubt, when Doppet sounded the  retreat. Half blinded by rage and by the blood trickling from a slight  wound in his forehead, the young Corsican rushed back to Doppet and  abused him in the language of the camp: \"Our blow at Toulon has  missed, because a---- has beaten the retreat.\" The soldiery applauded  this revolutionary licence, and bespattered their chief with similar  terms.    A few days later the tall soldierly Dugommier took the command:  reinforcements began to pour in, finally raising the strength of the  besiegers to 37,000 men. Above all, the new commander gave Buonaparte  _carte blanche_ for the direction of the artillery. New batteries  accordingly began to ring the Little Gibraltar on the landward side;  O'Hara, while gallantly heading a sortie, fell into the republicans'  hands, and the defenders began to lose heart. The worst disappointment  was the refusal of the Austrian Court to fulfil its promise, solemnly  given in September, to send 5,000 regular troops for the defence of  Toulon.    The final conflict took place on the night of December 16-17, when  torrents of rain, a raging wind, and flashes of lightning added new  horrors to the strife. Scarcely had the assailants left the sheltering  walls of La Seyne, than Buonaparte's horse fell under him, shot dead:  whole companies went astray in the darkness: yet the first column of  2,000 men led by Victor rush at the palisades of Fort Mulgrave, tear  them down, and sweep into the redoubt, only to fall in heaps before a  second line of defence: supported by the second column, they rally,  only to yield once more before the murderous fire. In despair,  Dugommier hurries on the column of reserve, with which Buonaparte  awaits the crisis of the night. Led by the gallant young Muiron, the  reserve sweeps into the gorge of death; Muiron, Buonaparte, and  Dugommier hack their way through the same embrasure: their men swarm  in on the overmatched red-coats and Spaniards, cut them down at their  guns, and the redoubt is won.    This event was decisive. The Neapolitans, who were charged to hold the  neighbouring forts, flung themselves into the sea; and the ships  themselves began to weigh anchor; for Buonaparte's guns soon poured  their shot on the fleet and into the city itself. But even in that  desperate strait the allies turned fiercely to bay. On the evening of  December 17th a young officer, who was destined once more to thwart  Buonaparte's designs, led a small body of picked men into the dockyard  to snatch from the rescuing clutch of the Jacobins the French warships  that could not be carried off. Then was seen a weird sight. The galley  slaves, now freed from their chains and clustering in angry groups,  menaced the intruders. Yet the British seamen spread the combustibles  and let loose the demon of destruction. Forthwith the flames shot up  the masts, and licked up the stores of hemp, tar, and timber: and the  explosion of two powder-ships by the Spaniards shook the earth for  many miles around. Napoleon ever retained a vivid mental picture of  the scene, which amid the hated calm of St. Helena he thus described:  \"The whirlwind of flames and smoke from the arsenal resembled the  eruption of a volcano, and the thirteen vessels blazing in the roads  were like so many displays of fireworks: the masts and forms of the  vessels were distinctly traced out by the flames, which lasted many  hours and formed an unparalleled spectacle.\" [25] The sight struck  horror to the hearts of the royalists of Toulon, who saw in it the  signal of desertion by the allies; and through the lurid night crowds  of panic-stricken wretches thronged the quays crying aloud to be taken  away from the doomed city. The glare of the flames, the crash of the  enemy's bombs, the explosion of the two powder-ships, frenzied many a  soul; and scores of those who could find no place in the boats flung  themselves into the sea rather than face the pikes and guillotines of  the Jacobins. Their fears were only too well founded; for a fortnight  later Freron, the Commissioner of the Convention, boasted that two  hundred royalists perished daily.    It remains briefly to consider a question of special interest to  English readers. Did the Pitt Ministry intend to betray the confidence  of the French royalists and keep Toulon for England? The charge has  been brought by certain French writers that the British, after  entering Toulon with promise that they would hold it in pledge for  Louis XVII., nevertheless lorded it over the other allies and revealed  their intention of keeping that stronghold. These writers aver that  Hood, after entering Toulon as an equal with the Spanish admiral,  Langara, laid claim to entire command of the land forces; that English  commissioners were sent for the administration of the town; and that  the English Government refused to allow the coming of the Comte de  Provence, who, as the elder of the two surviving brothers of Louis  XVI., was entitled to act on behalf of Louis XVII.[26] The facts in  the main are correct, but the interpretation put upon them may well be  questioned. Hood certainly acted with much arrogance towards the  Spaniards. But when the more courteous O'Hara arrived to take command  of the British, Neapolitan, and Sardinian troop, the new commander  agreed to lay aside the question of supreme command. It was not till  November 30th that the British Government sent off any despatch on the  question, which meanwhile had been settled at Toulon by the exercise  of that tact in which Hood seems signally to have been lacking. The  whole question was personal, not national.    Still less was the conduct of the British Government towards the Comte  de Provence a proof of its design to keep Toulon. The records of our  Foreign Office show that, before the occupation of that stronghold for  Louis XVII., we had declined to acknowledge the claims of his uncle to  the Regency. He and his brother, the Comte d'Artois, were notoriously  unpopular in France, except with royalists of the old school; and  their presence at Toulon would certainly have raised awkward questions  about the future government. The conduct of Spain had hitherto been  similar.[27] But after the occupation of Toulon, the Court of Madrid  judged the presence of the Comte de Provence in that fortress to be  advisable; whereas the Pitt Ministry adhered to its former belief,  insisted on the difficulty of conducting the defence if the Prince  were present as Regent, instructed Mr. Drake, our Minister at Genoa,  to use every argument to deter him from proceeding to Toulon, and  privately ordered our officers there, in the last resort, to refuse  him permission to land. The instructions of October 18th to the royal  commissioners at Toulon show that George III. and his Ministers  believed they would be compromising the royalist cause by recognizing  a regency; and certainly any effort by the allies to prejudice the  future settlement would at once have shattered any hopes of a general  rally to the royalist side.[28]    Besides, if England meant to keep Toulon, why did she send only 2,200  soldiers? Why did she admit, not only 6,900 Spaniards, but also 4,900  Neapolitans and 1,600 Piedmontese? Why did she accept the armed help  of 1,600 French royalists? Why did she urgently plead with Austria to  send 5,000 white-coats from Milan? Why, finally, is there no word in  the British official despatches as to the eventual keeping of Toulon;  while there are several references to _indemnities_ which George III.  would require for the expenses of the war--such as Corsica or some of  the French West Indies? Those despatches show conclusively that  England did not wish to keep a fortress that required a permanent  garrison equal to half of the British army on its peace footing; but  that she did regard it as a good base of operations for the overthrow  of the Jacobin rule and the restoration of monarchy; whereupon her  services must be requited with some suitable indemnity, either one of  the French West Indies or Corsica. These plans were shattered by  Buonaparte's skill and the valour of Dugommier's soldiery; but no  record has yet leaped to light to convict the Pitt Ministry of the  perfidy"]]]
