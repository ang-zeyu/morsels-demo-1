This, however, constituted merely one side of his policy, and the  negotiations which he carried on with his western neighbours were  conducted simultaneously with his wars against those of the east.  Alyattes had asserted his supremacy over the whole of the country on the  western side of the Halys, but it was of a very vague kind, having no  definite form, and devoid of practical results as far as several of the  districts in the interior were concerned. Croesus made it a reality, and  in less than ten years all the peoples contained within it, the Lycians  excepted--Mysians, Phrygians, Mariandynians, Paphlagonians, Thynians,  Bithynians, and Pamphylians--had rendered him homage. In its  constitution his empire in no way differed from those which at that time  shared the rule of Western Asia; the number of districts administered  directly by the sovereign were inconsiderable, and most of the states  comprised in it preserved their autonomy. Phrygia had its own princes,  who were descendants of Midas,* and in the same way Caria and Mysia  also retained theirs; but these vassal lords paid tribute and furnished  contingents to their liege of Sardes, and garrisons lodged in their  citadels as well as military stations or towns founded in strategic  positions, such as Prusa** in Bithynia, Cibyra, Hyda, Grimenothyrae, and  Temenothyrae,*** kept strict watch over them, securing the while free  circulation for caravans or individual merchants throughout the whole  country. Croesus had achieved his conquest just as Media was tottering  to its fall under the attacks of the Persians.         * This is proved by the history of the Prince Adrastus in       Herodotus. Herodotus probably alluded to this colonisation       by Crcesus, when he said that the Mysians of Olympus were       descendants of Lydian colonists.         ** Strabo merely says that the Kibyrates were descended from       the Lydians who dwelt in Cabalia; since Croesus was, as far       as we know, the only Lydian king who ever possessed this       part of Asia, Radet, with good reason, concludes that Kibyra       was colonised by him.         *** Radet has given good reasons for believing that at least       some of these towns were enlarged and fortified by Croesus.    Their victory placed the Lydian king in a position of great perplexity,  since it annulled the treaties concluded after the eclipse of 585, and  by releasing him from the obligations then contracted, afforded him an  opportunity of extending the limits within which his father had confined  himself. Now or never was the time for crossing the Halys in order to  seize those mineral districts with which his subjects had so long had  commercial relations; on the other hand, the unexpected energy of which  the Persians had just given proof, their bravery, their desire for  conquest, and the valour of their leader, all tended to deter him from  the project: should he be victorious, Cyrus would probably not rest  contented with tke annexation of a few unimportant districts or the  imposition of a tribute, but would treat his adversary as he had  Astyages, and having dethroned him, would divide Lydia into departments  to be ruled by one or other of his partisans. Warlike ideas,  nevertheless, prevailed at the court of Sardes, and, taking all into  consideration, we cannot deny that they had reason on their side. The  fall of Ecbatana had sealed the fate of Media proper, and its immediate  dependencies had naturally shared the fortunes of the capital; but the  more distant provinces still wavered, and they would probably attempt  to take advantage of the change of rule to regain their liberty. Cyrus,  obliged to take up arms against them, would no longer have his entire  forces at his disposal, and by attacking him at that juncture it might  be possible to check his power before it became irresistible. Having  sketched out his plan of campaign, Croesus prepared to execute it with  all possible celerity. Egypt and Chaldaea, like himself, doubtless felt  themselves menaced; he experienced little difficulty in persuading them  to act in concert with him in face of the common peril, and he obtained  from both Amasis and Nabonidus promises of effective co-operation. At  the same time he had recourse to the Greek oracles, and that of  Delphi was instrumental in obtaining for him a treaty of alliance and  friendship with Sparta. Negotiations had been carried on so rapidly,  that by the end of 548 all was in readiness for a simultaneous movement;  Sparta was equipping a fleet, and merely awaited the return of the  favourable season to embark her contingent; Egypt had already despatched  hers, and her Cypriot vassals were on the point of starting, while bands  of Thracian infantry were marching to reinforce the Lydian army. These  various elements represented so considerable a force of men, that, had  they been ranged on a field of battle, Cyrus would have experienced  considerable difficulty in overcoming them. An unforeseen act of  treachery obliged the Lydians to hasten their preparations and commence  hostilities before the moment agreed on. Eurybatos, an Ephesian, to whom  the king had entrusted large sums of money for the purpose of raising  mercenaries in the Peloponnesus, fled with his gold into Persia, and  betrayed the secret of the coalition. The Achaemenian sovereign did not  hesitate to forestall the attack, and promptly assumed the offensive.  The transport of an army from Ecbatana to the middle course of the  Halys would have been a long and laborious undertaking, even had it kept  within the territory of the empire; it would have necessitated crossing  the mountain groups of Armenia at their greatest width, and that at a  time when the snow was still lying deep upon the ground and the torrents  were swollen and unfordable. The most direct route, which passed through  Assyria and the part of Mesopotamia south of the Masios, lay for the  most part in the hands of the Chaldaeans, but their enfeebled condition  justified Cyrus's choice of it, and he resolved, in the event of their  resistance, to cut his way through sword in hand. He therefore bore  down upon Arbela by the gorges of Rowandiz in the month Nisan, making as  though he were bound for Karduniash; but before the Babylonians had time  to recover from their alarm at this movement, he crossed the river not  far from Nineveh and struck into Mesopotamia. He probably skirted the  slopes of the Masios, overcoming and killing in the month Iyyar  some petty king, probably the ruler of Armenia,* and debouched into  Cappadocia. This province was almost entirely in the power of the enemy;  Nabonidus had despatched couriers by the shortest route in order to warn  his ally, and if necessary to claim his promised help.         * Ploigl, who was the first to refer a certain passage in       the _Annals of Nabonidus_ to the expedition against Croesus,       restored Is[parda] as the name of the country mentioned, and       saw even the capture of Sardes in the events of the month       Iyyar, in direct contradiction to the Greek tradition. The       connection between the campaign beyond the Tigris and the       Lydian war seems to me incontestable, but the Babylonian       chronicler has merely recorded the events which affected       Babylonia. Cyrus' object was both to intimidate Nabonidus       and also to secure possession of the most direct, and at the       same time the easiest, route: by cutting across Mesopotamia,       he avoided the difficult marches in the mountainous       districts of Armenia. Perhaps we should combine, with the       information of the _Annals_, the passage of Xenophon, where       it is said that the Armenians refused tribute and service to       the King of Persia: Cyrus would have punished the rebels on       his way, after crossing the Euphrates.    Croesus, when he received them, had with him only the smaller portion of  his army, the Lydian cavalry, the contingents of his Asiatic subjects,  and a few Greek veterans, and it would probably have been wiser to defer  the attack till after the disembarkation of the Lacedaemonians; but  hesitation at so critical a moment might have discouraged his followers,  and decided his fate before any action had taken place. He therefore  collected his troops together, fell upon the right bank of the Halys,*  devastated the country, occupied Pteria and the neighbouring towns,  and exiled the inhabitants to a distance. He had just completed the  subjection of the White Syrians when he was met by an emissary from the  Persians; Cyrus offered him his life, and confirmed his authority on  condition of his pleading for mercy and taking the oath of vassalage.**  Croesus sent a proud refusal, which was followed by a brilliant  victory, after which a truce of three months was concluded between the  belligerents.***         * On this point Herodotus tells a current story of his time:       Thaies had a trench dug behind the army, which was probably       encamped in one of the bends made by the Halys; he then       diverted the stream into this new bed, with the result that       the Lydians found themselves on the right bank of the river       without having had the trouble of crossing it.         ** Nicolas of Damascus records that Cyrus, after the capture       of Sardes, for a short time contemplated making Croesus a       vassal king, or at least a satrap of Lydia.         *** We have two very different accounts of this campaign,       viz. that of Herodotus, and that of Polyonus. According to       Herodotus, Croesus gave battle only once in Pteria, with       indecisive result, and on the next day quietly retired to       his kingdom, thinking that Cyrus would not dare to pursue       him. According to Polyonus, Croesus, victorious in a first       engagement owing to a more or less plausible military       stratagem, consented to a truce, but on the day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#12)"],[1,"next year Antigonus mustered his forces in Coele-Syria, and got  ready for a second attack upon Egypt. He had more than eighty thousand  foot, accompanied with what was then the usual proportion of cavalry,  namely, eight thousand horse and eighty-three elephants. Demetrius  brought with him from Cyprus the fleet of one hundred and fifty long  galleys, and one hundred transports laden with stores and engines of  war. With this fleet, to which Ptolemy, after his late loss, had no  ships that he could oppose, Antigonus had no need to ask leave of the  Arabs of the little city of Petra to march through their passes; but he  led his army straight through the desert to Pelusium, while the ships of  burden kept close to the shore with the stores. The pride of Antigonus  would not let him follow the advice of the sailors, and wait eight days  till the north winds of the spring equinox had passed; and by this haste  many of his ships were wrecked on the coast, while others were driven  into the Nile and fell into the hands of Ptolemy. Antigonus himself,  marching with the land forces, found all the strong places well guarded  by the Egyptian army; and, being driven back at every point, discouraged  by the loss of his ships and by seeing whole bodies of his troops go  over to Ptolemy, he at last took the advice of his officers and led back  his army to Syria, while Ptolemy returned to Alexandria, to employ those  powers of mind in the works of peace which he had so successfully used  in his various wars.    Antigonus then turned the weight of his mighty kingdom against the  little island of Rhodes, which, though in sight of the coast of Asia  Minor, held itself independent of him, and in close friendship with  Ptolemy. The Dorian island of Rhodes had from the earliest dawn of  history held a high place among the states of Greece; and in all the  arts of civilised life, in painting, sculpture, letters, and commerce,  it had been lately rising in rank while the other free states had been  falling. Its maritime laws were so highly thought of that they were  copied by most other states, and, being afterwards adopted into the  Pandects of Justinian, they have in part become the law of modern  Europe. It was the only state in which Greek liberty then kept its  ground against the great empires of Alexander's successors.    Against this little state Demetrius led two hundred long galleys and one  hundred and seventy transports, with more than forty thousand men. The  Greek world looked on with deep interest while the veterans of Antigonus  were again and again driven back from the walls of the blockaded city  by its brave and virtuous citizens; who, while their houses were burning  and their walls crumbling under the battering-ram, left the statues of  Antigonus and Demetrius standing unhurt in the market-place, saved by  their love of art and the remembrance of former kindness, which, with  a true greatness of mind, they would not let the cruelties of the siege  outweigh. The galleys of Ptolemy, though unable to keep at sea against  the larger fleet of Demetrius, often forced their way into the harbour  with the welcome supplies of grain. Month after month every stratagem  and machine which the ingenuity of Demetrius could invent were tried and  failed; and, after the siege had lasted more than a year, he was glad to  find an excuse for withdrawing his troops; and the Rhodians in their joy  hailed Ptolemy with the title of Soter or _saviour_. This name he ever  afterwards kept, though by the Greek writers he is more often called  Ptolemy the son of Lagus. If we search the history of the world for a  second instance of so small a state daring to withstand the armies of so  mighty an empire, we shall perhaps not find any one more remarkable than  that of the same island, when, seventeen hundred years afterwards, it  again drew upon itself the eyes of the world, while it beat off the  forces of the Ottoman empire under Mahomet II.; and, standing like a  rock in front of Christendom, it rolled back for years the tide of war,  till its walls were at last crumbled to a heap of ruins by Suleiman the  Great, after a siege of many months.    The next of Ptolemy's conquests was Coele-Syria; and soon after this  the wars between these successors of Alexander were put an end to by  the death of Antigonus, whose overtowering ambition was among the  chief causes of quarrel. This happened at the great battle of Ipsus in  Phrygia, where they all met, with more than eighty thousand men in  each army. Antigonus, King of Asia Minor, was accompanied by his son  Demetrius, and by Pyrrhus, King of Epirus; and he was defeated by  Ptolemy, King of Egypt, Seleucus, King of Babylon, Lysimachus, King of  Thrace, and Cassander, King of Macedonia; and the old man lost his life  fighting bravely. After the battle Demetrius fled to Cyprus, and yielded  to the terms of peace which were imposed on him by the four allied  sovereigns. He sent his friend Pyrrhus as a hostage to Alexandria; and  there this young King of Epirus soon gained the friendship of Ptolemy  and afterwards his stepdaughter in marriage. Ptolemy was thus left  master of the whole of the southern coast of Asia Minor and Syria,  indeed of the whole coast of the eastern end of the Mediterranean, from  the island of Cos on the north to Cyrene on the south.    During these formidable wars with Antigonus, Ptolemy had never been  troubled with any serious rising of the conquered Egyptians; and perhaps  the wars may not have been without their use in strengthening his  throne. The first danger to a successful conqueror is from the avarice  and disappointment of his followers, who usually claim the kingdom as  their booty, and who think themselves wronged and their past services  forgotten if any limit is placed to their tyranny over the conquered.  But these foreign wars may have taught the Alexandrians that Ptolemy was  not strong enough to ill-treat the Egyptians, and may thus have saved  him from the indiscretion of his friends and from their reproaches for  ingratitude.    In the late war, the little Dorian island of Cos on the coast of Asia  Minor fell, as we have seen, under the power of Ptolemy. This island was  remarkable as being the first spot in Europe into which the manufacture  of silk was introduced, which it probably gained when under the power  of Persia before the overthrow of Darius. The luxury of the Egyptian  ladies, who affected to be overheated by any clothing that could conceal  their limbs, had long ago introduced a tight, thin dress which neither  our climate nor notions of modesty would allow, and for this dress,  silk, when it could be obtained, was much valued; and Pamphila of Cos  had the glory of having woven webs so transparent that the Egyptian  women were enabled to display their fair forms yet more openly by means  of this clothing.    [Illustration: 081.jpg ALEXANDRIAN LADY, ATTIRED IN BOMBYX SILK]    Cos continued always in the power of the Ptolemies, who used it as a  royal fortress, occasionally sending their treasures and their children  there as to a place of safety from Alexandrian rebellion; and there the  silk manufacture flourished in secret for two or three centuries.  When it ceased is unknown, as it was part of the merchants' craft to  endeavour to keep each branch of trade to themselves, by concealing the  channel through which they obtained their supply of goods, and many of  the dresses which were sold in Rome under the emperors by the name of  Coan robes may have been brought from the East through Alexandria.    One of the most valuable gifts which Egypt owed to Ptolemy was its  coinage. Even Thebes, \"where treasures were largest in the houses\" never  was able to pass gold and silver from hand to hand without the trouble  of weighing, and the doubt as to the fineness of the metal. The Greek  merchants who crowded the markets of Canopus and Alexandria must have  filled Lower Egypt with the coins of the cities from whence they came,  all unlike one another in stamp and weight; but, while every little city  or even colony of Greece had its own coinage, Egypt had as yet very few  coins of its own. We are even doubtful whether we know by sight those  coined by the Persians In the early years of Ptolemy's government  Ptolemy had issued a very few coins bearing the names of the young kings  in whose name he held the country, but he seems not to have coined any  quantity of money till after he had himself taken the title of king. His  coins are of gold, silver, and bronze, and are in a fine style of Greek  workmanship. Those of gold and silver bear on one side the portrait of  the king, without a beard, having the head bound with the royal diadem,  which, unlike the high priestly crown of the native Egyptian kings, or  the modern crown of gold and precious stones, is a plain riband tied in  a bow behind. On the other side they have the name of Ptolemy Soter, or  King Ptolemy, with an eagle standing upon a thunderbolt, which was only  another way of drawing the eagle and sun, the hieroglyphical characters  for the title Pharaoh.    [Illustration: 082.jpg EGYPTIAN COINAGE]    The gold coins of Egypt were probably made in Alexandria. The coins  are not of the same weight as those of Greece; but Ptolemy followed the  Egyptian standard of weight, which was that to which the Jewish shekel  was adjusted, and which was in use in the wealthy cities of Tyre and  Sidon and Beryttus. The drachma weighs fifty-five grains, making the  talent of silver worth about seven hundred and fifty dollars. Ptolemy's  bronze coins have the head of Serapis or Jupiter in the place of that of  the king, as is also the case with those of his successors; but few of  these bronze pieces bear any marks from which we can learn the reign  in which they were coined. They are of better metal than those of other  countries, as the bronze is free from lead and has more tin in it. The"]]]
