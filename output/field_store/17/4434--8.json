[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#12)"],[1," its turn is a frequent cause of diarrhoea and constipation, two  of the most common complaints among new chums. In his hunting  expeditions Mr. Hume had learnt his lesson from experience, and he  accordingly was a martinet on the rules of health. All the drinking-  water was first boiled. The boys could wear as little as they liked  during the heat of the day, so long as they protected their heads  and necks, but on the approach of evening they had to get into warm  and dry under-garments; they had to keep a sharp watch for the  striped \"anophele\" mosquito, were taught to spray the puncture, if  they were tapped by the mosquito lancet, with chloride of ethyl, and  had to submit occasionally to a hypodermic injection of quinine. The  nitrogen they got from condensed meat juices.    \"This is very much more like what I expected,\" said Venning, looking  from the broad river to the distant wooded banks, and from the dark  forest to the blue sky.    \"I can see two string of duck, a whole crowd of ibis on a little  island, a crocodile and a hippo.\"    Compton, who was facing the stern, glanced over his shoulder, then  directed his gaze aft again.    \"We seem to be traveling slowly,\" he growled.    \"There's no hurry, is there?\"    Compton raised his head a little, and looked under the shelter of a  hand.    \"They're coming,\" he said briefly.    \"Eh?\"  Venning stopped, and looked back.  The water glimmered under  the sun like a vast silver sheet. \"I can see nothing.\"    \"Don't you see a dark smudge. Well, that is the smoke from a  steamer. I thought at first it came from a land-fire. But it does  not. Send her along.\"    Venning quickened up, and for some minutes pedals and levers worked  at almost racing speed.    \"We cannot keep this up. Give him a call!\" Venning shouted, and Mr.  Hume looked round.    \"Bid you call?\"    \"They are after us,\" and Venning jerked his head back, while still  bending to his work.    The hunter loosened the canvas awning, and stood up for a long look  aft. Then he faced about, and threw a quick glance up-river.    \"Keep her straight for that wooded island,\" he said, pointing ahead  towards the south bank; and Venning pulled the steering-line to  place the Okapi on a new course.    Mr. Hume took in the awning and packed it away. \"Now, my lads,\" he  said, \"we'll just face the position. That's the fort launch racing  up, and she could overhaul us in two hours. If we surrender we  should be safe from violence, but they would probably confiscate our  boat or detain us for weeks. If we resist they would be justified in  running us down. What shall we do?\"    \"Escape,\" said Compton.    \"Of course,\" Venning chimed in.    \"By attempting to escape,\" continued Mr. Hume, \"we as good as admit  that we aided and abetted Muata, and, if captured, they would make  it harder for us.\"    \"At any rate, we meant to free Muata.\"    \"Besides, we must escape,\" said Compton, with  determination.    The perspiration was rolling off their faces, for, as soon as they  worked at high pressure, they felt the pull of the screw.    \"Come forward, both of you,\" said Mr. Hume, rolling up his sleeves.  \"Compton, you take the wheel, and Venning, you get out the guns.\"    They obeyed him, and he, kneeling on the aft-deck between the two  levers, grasped one in either hand, and got more speed out of the  Okapi than they had by their united efforts. The muscles stood out  like ropes on his brawny arms, and the levers smoked in the slots.    \"Keep her to the north of the island.\"    The boat hummed along, drew up to the nose of the island, skirted  its reedy side, where stood a hippo eating at the rank grass, and  then dropped it astern.    \"Good,\" said Mr. Hume, with a great grunt of satisfaction,  as he  swept his eyes over the river.    \"See those dark spots ahead? They must be the first of the thousand  islands that stretch away right up to the Loanda river. If we can  get into them we are safe.\"    \"Can I help?\" asked Venning, having set out the rifles in the well,  with the ammunition handy.    \"Whistle for a wind.  That's all. Fix your eyes on the islands,  Compton, and slip in where they are thickest.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" muttered Compton, frowning under the stress of his  excitement.    Venning searched for the field-glasses, and as the island they had  passed sank low astern, he swept the river for sign of the pursuing  launch.    \"By Jove!\" he muttered, with a start.    \"Well?\"    \"She has shifted her course. I can see the white of her hull right  under the trees on the south bank.\"    \"She must have gained a lot, then,\" grunted Mr. Hume, \"if you can  see her hull.\"    \"She's making out again. Perhaps she put in to speak a native  village, and maybe they have not seen us; we are low in the water.\"    \"They'll see us soon enough. Tell me when she passes the island we  just left.\"    \"She's making across. No, she's turning. Ah, now she's pointing  straight for us. I can see several people in her bows.\"    \"Now turn your glasses on the islands ahead.\"    Venning turned round, and looked up-stream.    \"Is the launch nearer than the islands?\"    \"I can see a stork standing on the edge of the water. The first of  the islands is nearest.\" He turned again to watch the launch.  \"There is more smoke--they are stoking up.\"    The launch was unquestionably coming up hand over hand, and it was  not long before Venning could see the foam at her bows, and the flag  of the Congo Free State flying at her stern. Then he saw a ball of  smoke.    \"She is firing!\" he yelled.    Compton never took his eyes off the little cluster of reeds ahead  that marked the first of the thousand islands.    \"Keep her going!\" he shouted.    Mr. Hume smiled grimly, for he was doing the work of two men.    \"They are loading the gun!\" cried Venning. \"Oh, if I only could  help!\" He buttoned and unbuttoned his coat, then picked up the  sculls, and fell to rowing with fierce energy. \"The smoke!\" he  cried. Then, a moment later, \"What's that noise?\" as a menacing  sound with a shrieking whistle to it smote on his ears.    There was no need for an answer. The shot struck the water about a  hundred yards short, and skipped by, wide of the Okapi, but still  too near to be pleasant.    \"Keep on!\" shouted Compton, fiercely.    The levers clanked furiously, and Venning, who had suspended his  sculling under the menace of the shot, tugged again at his work.    The steam-whistle of the launch sounded a series of sharp, jerky  calls, followed by the firing of a Mauser bullet. Venning's heart  was pumping blood at express speed under the violence of his  efforts, and his eyes in a wild stare were fixed on the approaching  craft, which had now brought its living freight within recognizable  distance. He could distinguish the two Belgian officers and the  swart face of the Arab chief, Hassan. He could see the men with  rifles, aiming, as it seemed, straight at him, and then he ducked  his head as he saw the smoke once more belch from the seven-pounder.  At the same moment he was nearly capsized by the sudden swerve of  the Okapi, as she almost turned on her keel. The shot struck the  water so close that the spray drenched them. Compton looked round  and shouted aloud--    \"They're aground! Hurrah!\"    Venning, recovering himself, saw the men on the launch hurled to the  deck.    \"Hurray!\" he shouted.    \"Keep on!\" shouted Compton; and, after another five minutes' burst,  the Okapi swept behind one island and passed in between two others.  \"Now,\" he said, \"give me the levers.\"    \"You're welcome,\" said Mr. Hume, wiping the moisture from his brow  and taking a huge breath.    He went forward to the wheel, and threaded the Okapi through narrow  passages between islands of all shapes and sizes, until after having  got into such a fastness as would be impracticable for the launch to  reach, he ran the boat on a shelving sandbank. Then, before anything  else was attempted, the awning was fixed, and they settled down for  a needed rest. Next the boys smacked each other on the back.    \"Was it by accident or design, Compton, that you led them into the  shallows?\"    \"I saw we could not reach the shelter of the island, and was feeling  bad, when I caught a ripple on the water to the right. I edged the  Okapi on after the first ball shot was fired, and as we drew nearer  I was sure there was a long sandbank. When I made that sharp turn as  the second shot was fired, I could see the outline of the bank just  under water, and turned to avoid it.\"    \"It was a mercy you altered our course just at that moment,  Compton.\"    \"Wasn't it? It was touch and go. We stood to be run down or knocked  into smithereens in another minute;\" and Venning shook Compton's  hand.    \"Did you see them go over like ninepins,\" laughed Compton, \"when  they struck? But I'm not claiming any credit, you know. If it had  not been for Mr. Hume----\"    \"We all did our share,\" said the hunter, \"and we have every cause to  be thankful; but we must not imagine that the chase is over.\"        CHAPTER VII    THE THOUSAND ISLANDS    They shoved off again, and Compton, being the least tired, took the  sculls and pushed on slowly in search of an anchorage for the night.  They passed many likely places, but Mr. Hume had one objection or  another to them, and the spot that finally satisfied him was a small  wooded island flanked by others of larger size, and so placed that  if they were menaced from any side there would be an opening for  escape in the opposite direction. The channel into which they  steered was so narrow that the branches of the trees joined  overhead, and when they tied up, the Okapi was completely hidden.  Before forcing their way into the leafy tunnel, they had taken down  the awning, but now, after having broken away many branches, they  refixed the canvas roof and drew the mosquito-curtains round, after  which they sought out and killed all the insect pests that remained  within the nets. There was no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],[0,"The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#12)"],[1,"that we did it. If it comes  to the worst, say it was an accident, that we were trying to light a  torch, to sneak the barrels away, when they took fire.\"    \"All right.\"    More water was thrown on the barrels, and then a small army of cadets  commenced to dig up dirt and stones, with which to cover the burning  objects. This worked very well on the barrels. But to reach the trees  was different. One thick cedar was blazing away like a torch--the flames  far above their heads.    \"Let us cut that tree down,\" ordered Captain Putnam.    Two axes had been brought along, and Dale used one while Peleg Snuggers  wielded the other. Soon the cedar commenced to totter.    \"Look out!\" cried Captain Putnam, and then crash! the tree came down,  directly on top of the tar-barrels. Up went a thick cloud of smoke and  sparks. But the cadets were ready with dirt and stones, and the danger  of a new blaze was quickly averted.    While the tree was being cut down, the cadets and teachers had been busy  with pickaxes and shovels, and also with their rakes and wet swabs, and  had put out much of the fire elsewhere. One more tree had to be leveled,  and this work was done by Joe and Bart. Then, after five minutes more  of hard work, the last of the fire was extinguished, and the crowd in  the woods was left in darkness.    \"Hello, it's dark enough now,\" cried Pepper. \"We'll need a lantern to  get out with.\"    \"Here's a torch,\" answered one cadet, and took up a cedar bough, and  commenced to wave it into a flame.    \"No more of that, Bates!\" cried Captain Putnam. \"We have had enough of  fire. We'll go back in the dark. Snuggers, you stay here and see to it  that the fire doesn't break out again.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" answered the general utility man.    \"Here is a pistol. If it does break out, fire two shots for an alarm.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I'll send Alexander Pop here with more water and with some lunch, for  you'll have to stay all night,\" went on the owner of the school.  Alexander Pop was a colored man who had come to the school to wait on  the table.    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Snuggers. He did not much relish remaining in the  woods all night, but he felt that he had to obey orders.    One by one the cadets and the teachers returned to Putnam Hall. The  conflagration in the woods had rather broken up the anticipated  celebration in honor of the football victory.    \"Now, I want to know who placed those tar-barrels in the woods,\" said  Captain Putnam, when he had assembled the cadets in the school building.    \"It was Jerry Cole, the roofer from Cedarville,\" answered John Fenwick,  a small youth usually called Mumps. He was known as a toady and a sneak,  and was very chummy with Dan Baxter.    \"How do you know, Fenwick?\"    \"I saw him with the barrels on his wagon.\"    \"Why should he put the barrels there?\"    \"I will tell you,\" answered Pepper, stepping forward. \"I bought them to  celebrate with to-night. I thought they'd make a dandy bonfire.\"    \"Indeed! Then you set them ablaze, Ditmore?\"    \"No, sir. My idea was to roll them to the lake-shore and pile them one  on top of the other.\"    \"Then who did set them on fire in the woods?\"    For the moment nobody spoke, but Pepper, Jack and Andy, as well as Joe,  looked at Reff Ritter and Gus Coulter.    \"I want an answer!\" cried Captain Putnam, sternly. \"Who started that  fire?\"    He looked around from one cadet to another. But nobody spoke.          CHAPTER XI    A MYSTERIOUS HAPPENING      It was a rule of honor among the cadets of Putnam Hall that no student  should tell on another. To do that would have been to put one's self  down as a sneak, and none of our friends wanted such a reputation.    \"I ask again, who started that fire?\" went on Captain Putnam, with  increased sternness.    \"I rather think I know the guilty parties,\" said George Strong, who had  walked away on an errand and had just returned, \"Ritter and Coulter,  what have you to say?\"    The two culprits started, and Coulter turned pale.    \"Why, I--er----\" stammered Gus. \"I--that is----\" He did not know how to  proceed. He did not dare deny his guilt, not knowing but what the  assistant teacher might have seen him and his crony light the  tar-barrels.    \"Well, if you--er--want to know the truth, Captain Putnam,  we--er--started the fire,\" stammered Reff Ritter. \"But it was an  accident.\"    \"An accident?\"    \"Yes, sir. We were--er--going to roll the barrels down to the  lake--going to hide 'em so that Ditmore and his friends couldn't find  'em, you know. Well, we didn't want to get the tar on our hands, so  we--er--started a little fire to see by--it was dark under the trees.  All of a sudden the barrels blazed up. We--er--didn't expect such a big  blaze.\"    \"That's it,\" cried Coulter, eagerly. \"We just made the fire at first to  see by.\"    \"Then you didn't really want to fire the barrels under the trees?\"    \"No, sir,\" came from both of the guilty ones.    \"It was a rash thing to do, to start such a blaze. In this wind you  might have burnt down the whole woods and endangered the school  buildings.\"    \"I don't believe Ritter and Coulter,\" whispered Andy to Pepper.    \"Neither do I,\" was the reply.    \"Ditmore, you said the barrels belonged to you?\" went on the owner of  the school.    \"Yes, sir. I bought them from the tar-roofer in Cedarville and he  delivered them. We were going to have a great bonfire--and we did!\" And  The Imp said this so dryly that even Captain Putnam had to smile.    \"Well, I presume I shall have to drop the matter,\" said the captain,  after a few more questions. \"But let me warn you all about fires in  those woods in the future. If a fire gained headway here we might burn  everything down to the ground.\"    So, from an official standpoint, the matter was dropped. Ritter beckoned  to Coulter, and they hurried away, followed by Nick Paxton and one or  two others.    \"Well, that ends the tar-barrel celebration,\" said Pepper, rather  mournfully. \"I really ought to make Ritter and Coulter pay for the  barrels.\"    \"You won't get any money out of Ritter,\" remarked Bart Conners.    \"How do you know, Bart?\"    \"Because he hasn't any. He asked for credit at the store yesterday--to  buy some cigarettes--and the shopkeeper refused, saying Ritter owed him  eighty cents already.\"    \"Humph!\" mused Pepper, and said no more.    \"Come on--forget it!\" cried Jack. \"We'll celebrate anyway.\"    \"We've got other barrels,\" came from Dale.    The cadets rushed out and to the lake-shore, and soon several bonfires  were blazing merrily. Around these the students congregated, and sang  songs and \"cut up\" generally. Dale had to make a speech, and the boys  caught him up on their shoulders and carried him around the campus.    \"Isn't it grand!\" murmured Bert Field. \"I am mighty glad I came to  Putnam Hall.\"    \"So am I,\" answered Fred Century. \"It's much different from what it was  at Pornell Academy.\"    \"It was a great victory, Fred, wasn't it?\"    \"It certainly was, Bert. I am only sorry for one thing.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"That it wasn't Pornell we beat instead of that other club.\"    \"Oh, well, we'll get a chance at Pornell some day,\" answered Bert Field.    The celebration along the lake-shore lasted until half-past eleven. Then  the bell was rung, and laughing and singing, the cadets trooped off to  their various dormitories.    \"All quiet by midnight!\" came the order.    \"Fifteen minutes yet,\" cried Andy, consulting his watch. \"Whoop-la! Here  goes!\" And in the joyousness of high spirits he turned a handspring over  one of the beds. Then he turned another spring over a table and stood on  his head on one of the chairs.    \"Hurrah for Snow's Imperial Consolidated Circus!\" cried Pepper. \"The  one and only aggregation of stupendous wonders on the face of the globe!  The marvelous twisting and death-defying acrobat! Walk up and see the  blood-curdling exhibition! It will cost you but the small sum of a dime,  ten cents; children double price, and no grandfathers unaccompanied by  their parents admitted. Line will form on the left and everybody will  please have his cash ready. Transfers not accepted on this line.\"    \"Good for Pepper!\" came from Jack. \"When he fails as a student he can  turn dime-museum shouter.\"    \"On the right you will see our most mysterious wonder, Major Jacobus  Ruddonowsky, the royal Russian sword swallower,\" went on The Imp,  pointing to his chum. \"He swallows two swords for breakfast, three for  lunch and six to eight for dinner, with daggers for dessert. He is  wonderfully strong, and can carry on his arms an amount of gold lace  that would break a camel's back. As soon as the tent is full he will  sing for you that famous ditty, entitled, 'How I Love to Line You Up  When I'm Major of the Gang.'\"    \"Wow! that is where you caught it, Jack!\" cried Dale, with a grin.    \"And here we have a third wonder,\" went on Pepper, pointing to the  football captain. \"Commodore Daleo, the leather-ball juggler. The most  renowned juggler of the spheroid in the world! You think it is here, but  it is not, for lo! he has juggled it over the line and kicked it as high  as an airship. He will show you----\"    \"Silence in here!\" came a voice from the doorway, and Josiah Crabtree  appeared. \"I will have silence!\"    \"Oh, dear!\" murmured Pepper. \"Anybody got any silence to spare? Mr.  Crabtree wants some.\"    \"You must all be in bed by midnight, and the light must be out,\" went on  the teacher. \"This unseemly revel must cease!\" And then he walked on, to  stop the noise coming from the other dormitories.    \"Say, Pepper, how do you like that?\" murmured Fred.    \"I knew there would be frost,\" sighed The Imp. \"Every time old Crabtree  appears we get a cold wave.\"    \"Be thankful he didn't mark you down for extra lessons,\" said Andy.    \"If he did that I'd rebel,\" returned Pepper.    After that the talk was carried on in whispers, and each cadet lost no  time in disrobing. A few minutes after midnight"]]]
