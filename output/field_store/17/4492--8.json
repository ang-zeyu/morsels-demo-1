The best of their churches is dedicated to the  saint, and holds his ashes. His statue stands over the high altar, with  the figure of a mountain in its hands, crowned with three castles, which  is likewise the arms of the commonwealth. They attribute to his  protection the long duration of their state, and look on him as the  greatest saint next the blessed virgin. I saw in their statute-book a  law against such as speak disrespectfully of him, who are to be punished  in the same manner as those convicted of blasphemy.    This petty republic has now lasted thirteen hundred years,[25] while all  the other states of Italy have several times changed their masters and  forms of government. Their whole history is comprised in two purchases,  which they made of a neighboring prince, and in a war in which they  assisted the pope against a lord of Rimini. In the year 1100 they bought  a castle in the neighborhood, as they did another in the year 1170. The  papers of the conditions are preserved in their archives, where it is  very remarkable that the name of the agent for the commonwealth, of the  seller, of the notary, and the witnesses, are the same in both the  instruments, tho drawn up at seventy years' distance from each other.  Nor can it be any mistake in the date, because the popes' and emperors'  names, with the year of their respective reigns, are both punctually set  down. About two hundred and ninety years after this they assisted Pope  Pius the Second against one of the Malatestas, who was then, lord of  Rimini; and when they had helped to conquer him, received from the pope,  as a reward for their assistance, four little castles. This they  represent as the flourishing time of the commonwealth, when their  dominions reached half-way up a neighboring hill; but at present they  are reduced to their old extent....    The chief officers of the commonwealth are the two capitaneos, who have  such a power as the old Roman consuls had, but are chosen every six  months. I talked with some that had been capitaneos six or seven times,  tho the office is never to be continued to the same persons twice  successively. The third officer is the commissary, who judges in all  civil and criminal matters. But because the many alliances, friendships,  and intermarriages, as well as the personal feuds and animosities, that  happen among so small a people might obstruct the course of justice, if  one of their own number had the distribution of it, they have always a  foreigner for this employ, whom they choose for three years, and  maintain out of the public stock. He must be a doctor of law, and a man  of known integrity. He is joined in commission with the capitaneos, and  acts something like the recorder of London under the lord mayor. The  commonwealth of Genoa was forced to make use of a foreign judge for many  years, while their republic was torn into the divisions of Guelphs and  Ghibelines. The fourth man in the state is the physician, who must  likewise be a stranger, and is maintained by a public salary. He is  obliged to keep a horse, to visit the sick, and to inspect all drugs  that are imported. He must be at least thirty-five years old, a doctor  of the faculty, and eminent for his religion and honesty, that his  rashness or ignorance may not unpeople the commonwealth. And, that they  may not suffer long under any bad choice, he is elected only for three  years.    The people are esteemed very honest and rigorous in the execution of  justice, and seem to live more happy and contented among their rocks and  snows, than others of the Italians do in the pleasantest valleys of the  world. Nothing, indeed, can be a greater instance of the natural love  that mankind has for liberty, and of their aversion to an arbitrary  government, than such a savage mountain covered with people, and the  Campania of Rome, which lies in the same country, almost destitute of  inhabitants.          PERUGIA[26]    BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE      We pursued our way, and came, by and by, to the foot of the high hill on  which stands Perugia, and which is so long and steep that Gaetano took a  yoke of oxen to aid his horses in the ascent. We all, except my wife,  walked a part of the way up, and I myself, with J----[27] for my  companion, kept on even to the city gate, a distance, I should think, of  two or three miles, at least. The lower part of the road was on the edge  of the hill, with a narrow valley on our left; and as the sun had now  broken out, its verdure and fertility, its foliage and cultivation,  shone forth in miraculous beauty, as green as England, as bright as only  Italy.    Perugia appeared above us, crowning a mighty hill, the most picturesque  of cities; and the higher we ascended, the more the view opened before  us, as we looked back on the course that we had traversed, and saw the  wide valley, sweeping down and spreading out, bounded afar by mountains,  and sleeping in sun and shadow. No language nor any art of the pencil  can give an idea of the scene....    We plunged from the upper city down through some of the strangest  passages that ever were called streets; some of them, indeed, being  arched all over, and, going down into the unknown darkness, looked like  caverns; and we followed one of them doubtfully, till it opened, out  upon the light. The houses on each side were divided only by a pace or  two, and communicated with one another, here and there, by arched  passages. They looked very ancient, and may have been inhabited by  Etruscan princes, judging from the massiveness of some of the foundation  stones. The present inhabitants, nevertheless, are by no means princely,  shabby men, and the careworn wives and mothers of the people, one of  whom was guiding a child in leading-strings through these antique  alleys, where hundreds of generations have trod before those little  feet. Finally we came out through a gateway, the same gateway at which  we entered last night.    The best part of Perugia, that in which the grand piazzas and the  principal public edifices stand, seems to be a nearly level plateau on  the summit of the hill; but it is of no very great extent, and the  streets rapidly run downward on either side. J---- and I followed one of  these descending streets, and were led a long way by it, till we at last  emerged from one of the gates of the city, and had another view of the  mountains and valleys, the fertile and sunny wilderness in which this  ancient civilization stands.    On the right of the gate there was a rude country path, partly overgrown  with grass, bordered by a hedge on one side, and on the other by the  gray city wall, at the base of which the tract kept onward. We followed  it, hoping that it would lead us to some other gate by which we might  reenter the city; but it soon grew so indistinct and broken, that it was  evidently on the point of melting into somebody's olive-orchard or  wheat-fields or vineyards, all of which lay on the other side of the  hedge; and a kindly old woman of whom I inquired told me (if I rightly  understood her Italian) that I should find no further passage in that  direction. So we turned back, much broiled in the hot sun, and only now  and then relieved by the shadow of an angle or a tower.          SIENA[28]    BY MR. AND MRS. EDWIN H. BLASHFIELD      That admirers of minute designs and florid detail could appreciate  grandeur as well, no one can doubt who has seen the plans of the Sienese  cathedral. Its history is one of a grand result, and of far grander, tho  thwarted endeavor, and it is hard to realize to-day, that the church as  it stands is but a fragment, the transept only, of what Siena willed.  From the state of the existing works no one can doubt that the brave  little republic would have finished it had she not met an enemy before  whom the sword of Monteaperto was useless. The plague of 1348 stalked  across Tuscany, and the chill of thirty thousand Sienese graves numbed  the hand of master and workman, sweeping away the architect who planned,  the masons who built, the magistrates who ordered, it left but the  yellowed parchment in the archives which conferred upon Maestro Lorenzo  Maitani the superintendence of the works.    The facade of the present church is amazing in its richness, undoubtedly  possesses some grand and much lovely detail, and is as undoubtedly  suggestive, with its white marble ornaments upon a pink marble ground,  of a huge, sugared cake. It is impossible to look at this restored  whiteness with the sun upon it; the dazzled eyes close involuntarily and  one sees in retrospect the great, gray church front at Rheims, or the  solemn facade of Notre Dame de Paris. It is like remembering an organ  burst of Handel after hearing the florid roulades of the mass within the  cathedral.    The interior is rich in color and fine in effect, but the northerner is  painfully imprest by the black and white horizontal stripes which,  running from vaulting to pavement, seem to blur and confuse the vision,  and the closely set bars of the piers are positively irritating. In the  hexagonal lantern, however, they are less offensive than elsewhere,  because the fan-like radiation of the bars above the great gilded  statues breaks up the horizontal effect. The decoration of the  stone-work is not happy; the use of cold red and cold blue with gilt  bosses in relief does much to vulgarize, and there is constant sally in  small masses which belittles the general effect. It is evident that the  Sienese tendency to floridity is answerable for much of this, and that  having added some piece of big and bad decoration, the cornice of papal  head, for instance, they felt forced to do away with it or continue it  throughout.    But this fault and many others are forgotten when we examine the detail  with which later men have filled the church. Other Italian cathedrals  possess art-objects of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#12)"],[1,"way but one,  and that is difficult; thou canst not release them but by being dumb for  seven years: thou must neither speak nor laugh; and wert thou to speak  one single word, and it wanted but one hour of the seven years, all  would be in vain, and thy brothers would perish because of that one  word.\"    Then the maiden said in her heart, \"I am quite sure that I can set my  brothers free,\" and went and sought a tall tree, climbed up, and sat  there spinning, and never spoke or laughed. Now it happened that a King,  who was hunting in the wood, had with him a large greyhound, who ran to  the tree where the maiden was, sprang up at it, and barked loudly. Up  came the King and saw the beautiful Princess with the golden star on her  forehead, and he was so charmed with her beauty that he prayed her to  become his wife. She gave no answer, only a little nod of her head. Then  he himself climbed the tree and brought her down, set her on his horse  and took her home. The wedding was held with great splendour and  rejoicing, but the bride neither spoke nor laughed. After they had lived  pleasantly together for a few years, the King's mother, who was a wicked  woman, began to slander the young Queen, and said to the King,    \"She is only a low beggar-maid that you have taken to yourself; who  knows what mean tricks she is playing? Even if she is really dumb and  cannot speak she might at least laugh; not to laugh is the sign of a bad  conscience.\"    At first the King would believe nothing of it, but the old woman talked  so long, and suggested so many bad things, that he at last let himself  be persuaded, and condemned the Queen to death.    Now a great fire was kindled in the courtyard, and she was to be burned  in it; and the King stood above at the window, and watched it all with  weeping eyes, for he had held her very dear. And when she was already  fast bound to the stake, and the fire was licking her garments with red  tongues, the last moment of the seven years came to an end. Then a  rushing sound was heard in the air, and twelve ravens came flying and  sank downwards; and as they touched the earth they became her twelve  brothers that she had lost. They rushed through the fire and quenched  the flames, and set their dear sister free, kissing and consoling her.  And now that her mouth was opened, and that she might venture to speak,  she told the King the reason of her dumbness, and why she had never  laughed. The King rejoiced when he heard of her innocence, and they all  lived together in happiness until their death.    But the wicked mother-in-law was very unhappy, and died miserably.          THE VAGABONDS      THE cock said to the hen,    \"It is nutting time, let us go together to the mountains and have a good  feast for once, before the squirrels come and carry all away.\"    \"Yes,\" answered the hen, \"come along; we will have a jolly time  together.\"    Then they set off together to the mountains, and as it was a fine day  they stayed there till the evening. Now whether it was that they had  eaten so much, or because of their pride and haughtiness, I do not know,  but they would not go home on foot; so the cock set to work to make a  little carriage out of nutshells. When it was ready, the hen seated  herself in it, and said to the cock,    \"Now you can harness yourself to it.\"    \"That's all very fine,\" said the cock, \"I would sooner go home on foot  than do such a thing: and I never agreed to it. I don't mind being  coachman, and sitting on the box; but as to drawing it myself, it's  quite out of the question.\"    As they were wrangling, a duck came quacking,    \"You thieving vagabonds, who told you you might go to my mountain? Look  out, or it will be the worse for you!\" and flew at the cock with bill  wide open. But the cock was not backward, and he gave the duck a good  dig in the body, and hacked at her with his spurs so valiantly that she  begged for mercy, and willingly allowed herself to be harnessed to the  carriage. Then the cock seated himself on the box and was coachman; so  off they went at a great pace, the cock crying out \"Run, duck, as fast  as you can!\"    When they had gone a part of the way they met two foot-passengers, a pin  and a needle. They cried \"Stop! stop!\" and said that it would soon be  blindman's holiday; that they could not go a step farther; that the ways  were very muddy; might they just get in for a little? they had been  standing at the door of the tailors' house of call and had been delayed  because of beer.    The cock, seeing they were slender folks that would not take up a great  deal of room, let them both step in, only they must promise not to tread  on his toes nor on the hen's.    Late in the evening they came to an inn, and there they found that they  could not go any farther that night, as the duck's paces were not good,  she waddled so much from side to side; so they turned in. The landlord  at first made some difficulty; his house was full already, and he  thought they had no very distinguished appearance; at last, however,  when they had made many fine speeches, and had promised him the egg that  the hen had laid on the way, and that he should keep the duck, who laid  one every day, he agreed to let them stay the night; and so they had a  very gay time.    Early in the morning, when it was beginning to grow light, and everybody  was still asleep, the cock waked up the hen, fetched the egg, and made a  hole in it, and they ate it up between them, and put the eggshell on the  hearth. Then they went up to the needle, who was still sleeping, picked  him up by his head, and stuck him in the landlord's chair-cushion, and  having also placed the pin in his towel, off they flew over the hills  and far away. The duck, who had chosen to sleep in the open air, and had  remained in the yard, heard the rustling of their wings, and, waking up,  looked about till she found a brook, down which she swam a good deal  faster than she had drawn the carriage.    A few hours later the landlord woke, and, leaving his feather-bed, began  washing himself; but when he took the towel to dry himself he drew the  pin all across his face, and made a red streak from ear to ear. Then he  went into the kitchen to light his pipe, but when he stooped towards the  hearth to take up a coal the eggshell flew in his eyes.    \"Everything goes wrong this morning,\" said he, and let himself drop,  full of vexation, into his grandfather's chair; but up he jumped in a  moment, crying, \"Oh dear!\" for the needle had gone into him.    Now he became angry, and had his suspicions of the guests who had  arrived so late the evening before; and when he looked round for them  they were nowhere to be seen.    Then he swore that he would never more harbour such vagabonds, that  consumed so much, paid nothing, and played such nasty tricks into the  bargain.          THE BROTHER AND SISTER      THE brother took his sister's hand and said to her,    \"Since our mother died we have had no good days; our stepmother beats us  every day, and if we go near her she kicks us away; we have nothing to  eat but hard crusts of bread left over; the dog under the table fares  better; he gets a good piece every now and then. If our mother only  knew, how she would pity us! Come, let us go together out into the wide  world!\"    So they went, and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and  stony places, and if it rained the sister said,    \"The skies and we are weeping together.\"    In the evening they came to a great wood, and they were so weary with  hunger and their long journey, that they climbed up into a high tree and  fell asleep.    The next morning, when they awoke, the sun was high in heaven, and shone  brightly through the leaves. Then said the brother,    \"Sister, I am thirsty; if I only knew where to find a brook, that I  might go and drink! I almost think that I hear one rushing.\" So the  brother got down and led his sister by the hand, and they went to seek  the brook. But their wicked stepmother was a witch, and had known quite  well that the two children had run away, and had sneaked after them, as  only witches can, and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the forest.  So when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles,  the brother was going to drink of it; but the sister heard how it said  in its rushing,        \"He a tiger will be who drinks of me,      Who drinks of me a tiger will be!\"    Then the sister cried,    \"Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and  will tear me in pieces.\"    So the brother refrained from drinking, though his thirst was great, and  he said he would wait till he came to the next brook. When they came to  a second brook the sister heard it say,        \"He a wolf will be who drinks of me,      Who drinks of me a wolf will be!\"    Then the sister cried,    \"Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will be turned into a wolf,  and will eat me up!\"    So the brother refrained from drinking, and said,    \"I will wait until we come to the next brook, and then I must drink,  whatever you say; my thirst is so great.\"    And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its  rushing it said,        \"Who drinks of me a fawn will be,      He a fawn will be who drinks of me!\"    Then the sister said,    \"O my brother, I pray drink not, or you will be turned into a fawn, and  run away far from me.\"    But he had already kneeled by the side of the brook and stooped and  drunk of the water, and as the first drops passed his lips he became a  fawn.    And the sister wept over her poor lost brother, and the fawn wept also,  and stayed sadly beside her. At last the maiden said,    \"Be comforted, dear fawn, indeed I will never leave you.\"    Then she untied her golden girdle and bound it round the fawn's neck,  and went and gathered rushes to make a soft cord, which she fastened to  him; and then she led him on, and they went"]]]
