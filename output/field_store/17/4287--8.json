Perfectly sincere, deeply and absolutely  assured of all that he knew, he said nothing he did not believe. His power  came not only from the depth and clearness of his convictions, but from  the absolute honesty of his soul.    Lao-tse, for twenty-eight years his contemporary, founder of one of the  three existing religions of China,--Tao-ism,--was a man of perhaps equal  intelligence. But he was chiefly a thinker; he made no attempt to elevate  the people; his purpose was to repress the passions, and to preserve the  soul in a perfect equanimity. He was the Zeno of the East, founder of a  Chinese stoicism. With him virtue is sure of its reward; everything is  arranged by a fixed law. His disciples afterwards added to his system a  thaumaturgic element and an invocation of departed spirits, so that now it  resembles our modern Spiritism; but the original doctrine of Lao-tse was  rationalism in philosophy and stoicism in morals. Confucius is said, in a  Chinese work, to have visited him, and to have frankly confessed his  inability to understand him. \"I know how birds fly, how fishes swim, how  animals run. The bird may be shot, the fish hooked, and the beast snared.  But there is the dragon. I cannot tell how he mounts in the air, and soars  to heaven. To-day I have seen the dragon.\"    But the modest man, who lived for others, has far surpassed in his  influence this dragon of intelligence. It certainly increases our hope for  man, when we see how these qualities of perfect honesty, good sense,  generous devotion to the public good, and fidelity to the last in  adherence to his work, have made Confucius during twenty-three centuries  the daily teacher and guide of a third of the human race.    Confucius was eminently distinguished by energy and persistency. He did  not stop working till he died. His life was of one piece, beautiful,  noble. \"The general of a large army,\" said he, \"may be defeated, but you  cannot defeat the determined mind of a peasant.\" He acted conformably to  this thought, and to another of his sayings. \"If I am building a mountain,  and stop before the last basketful of earth is placed on the summit, I  have failed of my work. But if I have placed but one basketful on the  plain, and go on, I am really building a mountain.\"    Many beautiful and noble things are related concerning the character of  Confucius,--of his courage in the midst of danger, of his humility in the  highest position of honor. His writings and life have given the law to  Chinese thought. He is the patron saint of that great empire. His doctrine  is the state religion of the nation, sustained by the whole power of the  emperor and the literary body. His books are published every year by  societies formed for that purpose, who distribute them gratuitously. His  descendants enjoy the highest consideration. The number of temples erected  to his memory is sixteen hundred and sixty. One of them occupies ten acres  of land. On the two festivals in the year sacred to his memory there are  sacrificed some seventy thousand animals of different kinds, and  twenty-seven thousand pieces of silk are burned on his altars. Yet his is  a religion without priests, liturgy, or public worship, except on these  two occasions.        Sec. 4. Philosophy and subsequent Development of Confucianism.      According to Mr. Meadows, the philosophy of China, in its origin and  present aspect, may be thus briefly described.[14] Setting aside the  Buddhist system and that of Tao-ism, which supply to the Chinese the  element of religious worship and the doctrine of a supernatural world,  wanting in the system of Confucius, we find the latter as the established  religion of the state, merely tolerating the others as suited to persons  of weak minds. The Confucian system, constantly taught by the competitive  examinations, rules the thought of China. Its first development was from  the birth of Confucius to the death of Mencias (or from 551 B.C. to 313  B.C.). Its second period was from the time of Chow-tsze (A.D. 1034) to  that of Choo-tsze (A.D. 1200). The last of these is the real fashioner of  Chinese philosophy, and one of the truly great men of the human race. His  works are chiefly Commentaries on the Kings and the Four Books. They are  committed to memory by millions of Chinese who aspire to pass the  public-service examinations. The Chinese philosophy, thus established by  Choo-tsze, is as follows.[15]    There is one highest, ultimate principle of all existence,--the Tae-keih,  or Grand Extreme. This is absolutely immaterial, and the basis of the  order of the universe. From this ultimate principle, operating from all  eternity, come all animate and inanimate nature. It operates in a twofold  way, by expansion and contraction, or by ceaseless active and passive  pulsations. The active expansive pulsation is called Yang, the passive  intensive pulsation is Yin, and the two may be called the Positive and  Negative Essences of all things. When the active expansive phase of the  process has reached its extreme limit, the operation becomes passive and  intensive; and from these vibrations originate all material and mortal  existences. Creation is therefore a perpetual process,--matter and spirit  are opposite results of the same force. The one tends to variety, the  other to unity; and variety in unity is a permanent and universal law of  being. Man results from the utmost development of this pulsatory action  and passion; and man's nature, as the highest result, is perfectly good,  consisting of five elements, namely, charity, righteousness, propriety,  wisdom, and sincerity. These constitute the inmost, essential nature of  man; but as man comes in contact with the outward world evil arises by the  conflict. When man follows the dictates of his nature his actions are  good, and harmony results. When he is unduly influenced by the outward  world his actions are evil, and discord intervenes. The holy man is one  who has an instinctive, inward sight of the ultimate principle in its  twofold operation (or what we should call the sight of God, the beatific  vision), and who therefore spontaneously and easily obeys his nature.  Hence all his thoughts are perfectly wise, his actions perfectly good, and  his words perfectly true. Confucius was the last of these holy men. The  infallible authority of the Sacred Books results from the fact that their  writers, being holy men, had an instinctive perception of the working of  the ultimate principle.    All Confucian philosophy is pervaded by these principles: first, that  example is omnipotent; secondly, that to secure the safety of the empire,  you must secure the happiness of the people; thirdly, that by solitary  persistent thought one may penetrate at last to a knowledge of the essence  of things; fourthly, that the object of all government is to make the  people virtuous and contented.        Sec. 5. Lao-tse and Tao-ism.      One of the three religious systems of China is that of the Tao, the other  two being that of Confucius, and that of Buddhism in its Chinese form. The  difficulty in understanding Tao-ism comes from its appearing under three  entirely distinct forms: (1) as a philosophy of the absolute or  unconditioned, in the great work of the Tse-Lao, or old teacher;[16] (2)  as a system of morality of the utilitarian school,[17] which resolves duty  into prudence; and (3) as a system of magic, connected with the belief in  spirits. In the Tao-te-king we have the ideas of Lao himself, which we  will endeavor to state; premising that they are considered very obscure  and difficult even by the Chinese commentators.    The TAO (Sec. 1) is the unnamable, and is the origin of heaven and earth. As  that which can be named, it is the mother of all things. These two are  essentially one. Being and not-being are born from each other (Sec. 2). The  Tao is empty but inexhaustible (Sec. 4), is pure, is profound, and was before  the Gods. It is invisible, not the object of perception, it returns into  not-being (Sec.Sec. 14, 40). It is vague, confused, and obscure (Sec. 25, 21). It  is little and strong, universally present, and all beings return into it  (Sec. 32). It is without desires, great (Sec. 34). All things are born of being,  being is born of not-being (Sec. 40).    From these and similar statements it would appear that the philosophy of  the Tao-te-king is that of absolute being, or the identity of being and  not-being. In this point it anticipated Hegel by twenty-three  centuries.[18] It teaches that the absolute is the source of being and of  not-being. Being is essence, not-being is existence. The first is the  noumenal, the last the phenomenal.'    As being is the source of not-being (Sec. 40), by identifying one's self with  being one attains to all that is not-being, i.e. to all that exists.  Instead, therefore, of aiming at acquiring knowledge, the wise man avoids  it: instead of acting, he refuses to act. He \"feeds his mind with a wise  passiveness.\" (Sec. 16.) \"_Not to act_ is the source of all power,\" is a  thesis continually present to the mind of Lao (Sec.Sec. 3, 23, 38,43,48, 63).  The wise man is like water (Sec.Sec. 8, 78), which seems weak and is strong;  which yields, seeks the lowest place, which seems the softest thing and  breaks the hardest thing. To be wise one must renounce wisdom, to be good  one must renounce justice and humanity, to be learned one must renounce  knowledge (Sec.Sec. 19, 20, 45), and must have no desires (Sec.Sec. 8, 22), must  detach one's self from all things (Sec. 20) and be like a new-born babe. From  everything proceeds its opposite, the easy from the difficult, the  difficult from the easy, the long from the short, the high from the low,  ignorance from knowledge, knowledge from ignorance, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"was effected; and the fruit of that  union was the Church of England.    To the peculiarities of this great institution, and to the strong  passions which it has called forth in the minds both of friends and of  enemies, are to be attributed many of the most important events which  have, since the Reformation, taken place in our country; nor can the  secular history of England be at all understood by us, unless we study  it in constant connection with the history of her ecclesiastical polity.    The man who took the chief part in settling the condition, of the  alliance which produced the Anglican Church was Archbishop Cranmer. He  was the representative of both the parties which, at that time, needed  each other's assistance. He was at once a divine and a courtier. In his  character of divine he was perfectly ready to go as far in the way of  change as any Swiss or Scottish Reformer. In his character of courtier  he was desirous to preserve that organisation which had, during many  ages, admirably served the purposes of the Bishops of Rome, and might be  expected now to serve equally well the purposes of the English Kings and  of their ministers. His temper and his understanding, eminently fitted  him to act as mediator. Saintly in his professions, unscrupulous in  his dealings, zealous for nothing, bold in speculation, a coward and a  timeserver in action, a placable enemy and a lukewarm friend, he was in  every way qualified to arrange the terms of the coalition between the  religious and the worldly enemies of Popery.    To this day the constitution, the doctrines, and the services of the  Church, retain the visible marks of the compromise from which she  sprang. She occupies a middle position between the Churches of Rome  and Geneva. Her doctrinal confessions and discourses, composed by  Protestants, set forth principles of theology in which Calvin or  Knox would have found scarcely a word to disapprove. Her prayers and  thanksgivings, derived from the ancient Breviaries, are very generally  such that Cardinal Fisher or Cardinal Pole might have heartily joined in  them. A controversialist who puts an Arminian sense on her Articles and  Homilies will be pronounced by candid men to be as unreasonable as a  controversialist who denies that the doctrine of baptismal regeneration  can be discovered in her Liturgy.    The Church of Rome held that episcopacy was of divine institution, and  that certain supernatural graces of a high order had been transmitted by  the imposition of hands through fifty generations, from the Eleven who  received their commission on the Galilean mount, to the bishops who  met at Trent. A large body of Protestants, on the other hand, regarded  prelacy as positively unlawful, and persuaded themselves that they  found a very different form of ecclesiastical government prescribed in  Scripture. The founders of the Anglican Church took a middle course.  They retained episcopacy; but they did not declare it to be an  institution essential to the welfare of a Christian society, or to the  efficacy of the sacraments. Cranmer, indeed, on one important occasion,  plainly avowed his conviction that, in the primitive times, there was no  distinction between bishops and priests, and that the laying on of hands  was altogether superfluous.    Among the Presbyterians the conduct of public worship is, to a great  extent, left to the minister. Their prayers, therefore, are not exactly  the same in any two assemblies on the same day, or on any two days in  the same assembly. In one parish they are fervent, eloquent, and full of  meaning. In the next parish they may be languid or absurd. The priests  of the Roman Catholic Church, on the other hand, have, during many  generations, daily chanted the same ancient confessions, supplications,  and thanksgivings, in India and Lithuania, in Ireland and Peru. The  service, being in a dead language, is intelligible only to the learned;  and the great majority of the congregation may be said to assist as  spectators rather than as auditors. Here, again, the Church of England  took a middle course. She copied the Roman Catholic forms of prayer,  but translated them into the vulgar tongue, and invited the illiterate  multitude to join its voice to that of the minister.    In every part of her system the same policy may be traced. Utterly  rejecting the doctrine of transubstantiation, and condemning as  idolatrous all adoration paid to the sacramental bread and wine, she  yet, to the disgust of the Puritan, required her children to receive the  memorials of divine love, meekly kneeling upon their knees. Discarding  many rich vestments which surrounded the altars of the ancient faith,  she yet retained, to the horror of weak minds, a robe of white linen,  typical of the purity which belonged to her as the mystical spouse of  Christ. Discarding a crowd of pantomimic gestures which, in the Roman  Catholic worship, are substituted for intelligible words, she yet  shocked many rigid Protestants by marking the infant just sprinkled from  the font with the sign of the cross. The Roman Catholic addressed his  prayers to a multitude of Saints, among whom were numbered many men  of doubtful, and some of hateful, character. The Puritan refused the  addition of Saint even to the apostle of the Gentiles, and to the  disciple whom Jesus loved. The Church of England, though she asked  for the intercession of no created being, still set apart days for the  commemoration of some who had done and suffered great things for the  faith. She retained confirmation and ordination as edifying rites; but  she degraded them from the rank of sacraments. Shrift was no part of her  system. Yet she gently invited the dying penitent to confess his sins to  a divine, and empowered her ministers to soothe the departing soul by  an absolution which breathes the very spirit of the old religion. In  general it may be said that she appeals more to the understanding, and  less to the senses and the imagination, than the Church of Rome, and  that she appeals less to the understanding, and more to the senses  and imagination, than the Protestant Churches of Scotland, France, and  Switzerland.    Nothing, however, so strongly distinguished the Church of England from  other Churches as the relation in which she stood to the monarchy. The  King was her head. The limits of the authority which he possessed,  as such, were not traced, and indeed have never yet been traced with  precision. The laws which declared him supreme in ecclesiastical  matters were drawn rudely and in general terms. If, for the purpose of  ascertaining the sense of those laws, we examine the books and lives of  those who founded the English Church, our perplexity will be increased.  For the founders of the English Church wrote and acted in an age of  violent intellectual fermentation, and of constant action and reaction.  They therefore often contradicted each other and sometimes contradicted  themselves. That the King was, under Christ, sole head of the Church was  a doctrine which they all with one voice affirmed: but those words had  very different significations in different mouths, and in the same  mouth at different conjunctures. Sometimes an authority which would have  satisfied Hildebrand was ascribed to the sovereign: then it dwindled  down to an authority little more than that which had been claimed by  many ancient English princes who had been in constant communion with the  Church of Rome. What Henry and his favourite counsellors meant, at one  time, by the supremacy, was certainly nothing less than the whole power  of the keys. The King was to be the Pope of his kingdom, the vicar  of God, the expositor of Catholic verity, the channel of sacramental  graces. He arrogated to himself the right of deciding dogmatically what  was orthodox doctrine and what was heresy, of drawing up and imposing  confessions of faith, and of giving religious instruction to his people.  He proclaimed that all jurisdiction, spiritual as well as temporal, was  derived from him alone, and that it was in his power to confer episcopal  authority, and to take it away. He actually ordered his seal to be put  to commissions by which bishops were appointed, who were to exercise  their functions as his deputies, and during his pleasure. According to  this system, as expounded by Cranmer, the King was the spiritual as well  as the temporal chief of the nation. In both capacities His Highness  must have lieutenants. As he appointed civil officers to keep his seal,  to collect his revenues, and to dispense justice in his name, so  he appointed divines of various ranks to preach the gospel, and to  administer the sacraments. It was unnecessary that there should be any  imposition of hands. The King,--such was the opinion of Cranmer given in  the plainest words,--might in virtue of authority derived from God, make  a priest; and the priest so made needed no ordination whatever. These  opinions the Archbishop, in spite of the opposition of less courtly  divines, followed out to every legitimate consequence. He held that his  own spiritual functions, like the secular functions of the Chancellor  and Treasurer, were at once determined by a demise of the crown. When  Henry died, therefore, the Primate and his suffragans took out fresh  commissions, empowering them to ordain and to govern the Church till the  new sovereign should think fit to order otherwise. When it was objected  that a power to bind and to loose, altogether distinct from temporal  power, had been given by our Lord to his apostles, some theologians of  this school replied that the power to bind and to loose had descended,  not to the clergy, but to the whole body of Christian men, and ought  to be exercised by the chief magistrate as the representative of the  society. When it was objected that Saint Paul had spoken of certain  persons whom the Holy Ghost had made overseers and shepherds of"]]]
