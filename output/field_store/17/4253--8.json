If he saw any  live fighting Indians, it is more than I did, but I had a good many  bloody struggles with the mosquitos, and although I never fainted from  loss of blood I can truly say that I was often very hungry. Mr. Speaker,  if I should ever conclude to doff whatever our Democratic friends may  suppose there is in me of black-cockade Federalism, and thereupon they  shall take me up as their candidate for the Presidency, I protest they  shall not make fun of me as they have of General Cass by attempting to  write me into a military hero.\"    Lincoln's popularity among his comrades in the field was so great that  at the close of his military service, which had lasted three months, he  was nominated as a candidate for the State Legislature. \"His first  appearance on the stump in the course of the canvass was at Pappsville,  about eleven miles west of Springfield, upon the occasion of a public  sale. The sale over, speech-making was about to begin, when Lincoln  observed some strong symptoms of inattention in his audience which had  taken that particular moment to engage in a a general fight. Lincoln saw  that one of his friends was suffering more than he liked, and stepping  into the crowd he shouldered them sternly away from his man until he met  a fellow who refused to fall back. Him he seized by the nape of the neck  and the seat of his breeches, and tossed him 'ten or twelve feet  easily.' After this episode--as characteristic of him as of the  times--he mounted the platform and delivered with awkward modesty the  following speech: 'Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens, I presume you all know  who I am. I am humble Abraham Lincoln. I have been solicited by my  friends to become a candidate for the Legislature. My politics are short  and sweet, like the old woman's dance. I am in favor of a national bank.  I am in favor of the internal-improvement system and a high protective  tariff. These are my sentiments and political principles. If elected I  shall be thankful. If not, it will be all the same.'\"    Lincoln's friend, Mr. A.Y. Ellis, who was with him during a part of  this campaign, says: \"He wore a mixed-jeans coat, claw-hammer style,  short in the sleeves and bobtail,--in fact, it was so short in the tail  that he could not sit down on it,--flax and tow linen pantaloons, and a  straw hat. I think he wore a vest, but I do not remember how it looked.  He wore pot-metal boots. I went with him on one of his electioneering  trips to Island Grove, and he made a speech which pleased his party  friends very well, although some of the Jackson men tried to make sport  of it. He told several good anecdotes in the speech, and applied them  very well, I thought.\"    The election took place in August, and although Lincoln was defeated he  received two hundred and seventy-seven out of the two hundred and  eighty-four votes cast in his precincts. He was so little known outside  of New Salem that the chances of election were hopelessly against him,  yet the extraordinary evidence of favor shown by the vote of his  fellow-townsmen was a flattering success in the midst of defeat. His  failure to be elected, however, left him once more without occupation.  He was without means, and felt the necessity of undertaking some  business that would provide him an income, however small. It seems that  at this time he considered seriously learning the blacksmith's trade,  but while entertaining the idea an event occurred which opened the way  in another direction. The particulars of this event are given by Mr.  W.G. Greene. \"A man named Reuben Radford,\" says Mr. Greene, \"was the  keeper of a small store in the village of New Salem. A friend told him  to look out for the 'Clary Grove boys' or they would smash him up. He  said he was not afraid. He was a great big fellow. But his friend said,  'They don't come alone. If one can't whip you, two or three can, and  they'll do it.' One day he left his store in charge of his brother, with  injunctions that if the 'Clary Grove boys' came he must not let them  have more than two drinks apiece. All the stores in those days kept  liquor to sell and had a corner for drinking. The store was nicely  fitted up, and had many things in glass jars nicely labelled. The 'Clary  Grove boys' came, and took two drinks each. The clerk refused them any  more as politely as he could. Then they went behind the counter and  helped themselves. They got roaring drunk and went to work smashing  everything in the store. The fragments on the floor were an inch deep.  They left and went off on their horses whooping and yelling. Coming  across some herds of cattle, they took the bells from their necks,  fastened them to the tails of the leaders, and chased them over the  country yelling like mad. Radford heard them, and, mounting his horse,  rode in hot haste to the store. I had been sent that morning with grist  to the mill, and had to pass the store. I saw Radford ride up, his horse  a lather of foam. He dismounted, and looked in upon the wreck through  the open door He was aghast at the sight, and said, 'I'll sell out this  thing to the first man that comes along.' I rode up and said, 'I'll give  you four hundred dollars for it.' 'Done!' said he. 'But,' I said, 'I  have no money. I must have time.' 'How much?' 'Six months.' 'Agreed.' He  drew up a note for four hundred dollars at six months, and I signed it.  I began to think I was stuck. Then the boys came in, and among them was  Lincoln. 'Cheer up, Billy,' he said. 'It's a good thing. We'll take an  inventory.' 'No more inventories for me,' said I, not knowing what he  meant. He explained that we should take an account of stock to see how  much was left. We found that it amounted to about twelve hundred  dollars. Lincoln and Berry consulted over it, and offered me two hundred  and fifty dollars for my bargain. I accepted, stipulating that they  should assume my notes. Berry was a wild fellow--a gambler. He had a  fine horse, with a splendid saddle and bridle. He turned over the horse  as part pay. Lincoln let Berry run the store, and it soon ran out. I  had to pay the note. Lincoln said he would pay it some day and did, with  interest.\" This ended Lincoln's brief career as a country merchant.    Many of the anecdotes in the foregoing pages touch upon Lincoln's  ambition to fit himself for a public speaker. Even at this early day the  settlers in New Salem were infected with the general desire to join in  the march toward intellectual improvement. To aid in this object, they  had established a club entitled the New Salem Literary Society. Before  this association, the studious Lincoln was invited to speak. Mr. R.B.  Rutledge, the brother of Anne Rutledge, says of the event: \"About the  year 1832 or 1833, Mr. Lincoln made his first effort at public speaking.  A debating club, of which James Rutledge was president, was organized  and held regular meetings. As Lincoln arose to speak, his tall form  towered above the little assembly. Both hands were thrust down deep in  the pockets of his pantaloons. A perceptible smile at once lit up the  faces of the audience, for all anticipated the relation of some humorous  story. But he opened up the discussion in splendid style, to the  infinite astonishment of his friends. As he warmed with his subject, his  hands would forsake his pockets and enforce his ideas by awkward  gestures, but would very soon seek their easy resting-places. He pursued  the question with reason and argument so pithy and forcible that all  were amazed. The president, after the meeting, remarked to his wife that  there was more in Abe's head than wit and fun; that he was already a  fine speaker; that all he lacked was culture to enable him to reach the  high destiny which he knew was in store for him.\"    On the 7th of May, 1833, Lincoln was appointed postmaster at New Salem  by President Jackson. The duties of the position were light, there being  only a weekly mail, and the remuneration was correspondingly small.  \"The office was too insignificant to be considered politically, and it  was given to the young man because everybody liked him, and because he  was the only man willing to take it who could make out the returns. He  was exceedingly pleased with the appointment, because it gave him a  chance to read every newspaper that was taken in the vicinity. He had  never been able to get half the newspapers he wanted, and the office  gave him the prospect of a constant feast. Not wishing to be tied to the  office, as it yielded him no revenue that would reward him for the  confinement, he made a post-office of his hat. Whenever he went out, the  letters were placed in his hat. When an anxious looker for a letter met  the postmaster he found also the post-office, and the public official,  taking off his hat, looked over and delivered the mail wherever the  public might find him. He kept the office until it was discontinued, or  was removed to Petersburg.\"    A small balance due the government remained in the hands of Lincoln at  the discontinuance of the office. Time passed on, and he had removed to  Springfield and was practicing law, having his place of business in Dr.  Henry's office. Meanwhile his struggle with poverty was unabated, and he  had often been obliged to borrow money from his friends to purchase the  barest necessities. It was at this juncture that the agent of the United  States called for a settlement of his post-office accounts. The  interview took place in the presence of Dr. Henry who thus describes it:  \"I did not believe he had the money on hand to meet the draft, and I was  about to call him aside and loan him the money, when he asked the agent  to be seated a moment. He went over to his trunk at his boarding-house  and returned with an old blue sock with a quantity of silver and copper  coin tied up in it. Untying the sock, he poured the contents on the  table and proceeded to count the coin, which"]]]
