Differences of  religion ceased to be a complete bar to matrimonial and other alliances  between Mahomedans and Hindus. Even in war Mahomedan mercenaries took  service with Hindu chiefs, and Hindus under Mahomedan captains. There  was thus, if not a fusion, a gradual mingling of the Mahomedan and Hindu  populations which, in spite of many fierce conflicts, tended to promote  a new _modus vivendi_ between them. It was a period of transition from  the era of mere ruthless conquest, which Timur's tempestuous irruption  brought practically to a close, to the era of constructive  statesmanship, which it was reserved to Akbar, the greatest of the  Moghul Emperors, to inaugurate.    Each of these early Mahomedan states has a story and a character of its  own, and each goes to illustrate the subtle ascendancy which the Hindu  mind achieved over the conquering Mahomedan. I can only select a few  typical examples. None is in its way more striking than Mandu, over  whose desolation the jungle now spreads its kindly mantle. Within two  years of Timur's raid into India the Afghan governors of Malwa  proclaimed themselves independent, and Hushang Ghuri, from whom the new  dynasty took its name, proceeded to build himself a new capital. The  grey grim walls of Mandu still crown a lofty outpost of the Vindhya  hills, some seventy miles south-east of Indore, the natural scarp  falling away as steeply on the one side to the fertile plateau of Malwa  as on the other to the broad valley of the sacred Nerbudda. The place  had no Hindu associations, and in the stately palaces and mosques  erected by Hushang and his immediate successors early in the fifteenth  century scarcely a trace of Hindu influence can be detected, though some  of them still stand almost intact amidst the luxuriant vegetation which  has now swallowed up the less substantial remains of what was once a  populous and wealthy city. The Ghuris came from Afghanistan, and the  great mosque of Hushang Ghuri--in spite of inscriptions which say in  one place that it has been modelled on the mosque of the Kaaba at Mecca,  and in another place on the great mosque at Damascus--is perhaps the  finest example of pure Pathan architecture in India, and one of the  half-dozen noblest shrines devoted to Mahomedan worship in the whole  world; a mighty structure of red sandstone and white marble, stern and  simple, and as perfect in the proportions of its long avenues of pointed  arches as in the breadth of its spacious design. Behind it, under a  great dome of white marble, Hushang himself sleeps. Unique in its way,  too, is the lofty hall of the Hindola Mahal, with its steeply sloping  buttresses--a hall which has not been inaptly compared to the great  dining-hall of some Oxford or Cambridge College--and alongside of it,  the more delicate beauty, perhaps already suggestive of Hindu  collaboration, of the Jahaz Mahal, another palace with hanging balconies  and latticed windows of carved stone overlooking on either side an  artificial lake covered with pink lotus blossoms. Mandu was at first an  essentially Mahomedan city, and under Mahmud Khilji, who wrested the  throne from Hushang's effete successor, its fame as a centre of Islamic  learning attracted embassies even from Egypt and Bokhara. But its  greatness was short-lived. Mahmud's son, Ghijas-ud-Din, had been for  many years his father's right hand, both in council and in the field.  But no sooner did he come to the throne in 1469 than he discharged all  the affairs of the state on to his own son and retired into the  seraglio, where 15,000 women formed his court and provided him even with  a bodyguard. Five hundred beautiful young Turki women, armed with bows  and arrows, stood, we are told, on his right hand, and, on his left,  five hundred Abyssinian girls. Profligate succeeded profligate, and the  degeneracy of his Mahomedan rulers was the Hindu's opportunity. The  power passed into the hands of Hindu officers, who were even suffered to  take unto themselves mistresses from among the Mahomedan women of the  court. The end came, after many vicissitudes, with Baz Bahadur, chiefly  known for his passionate devotion to the fair Hindu, Rup Mati, for whom  he built on the very crest of the hill, so that from her windows she  might worship the waters of the sacred Nerbudda, the only palace now  surviving in Mandu which bears a definite impress of Hinduism. Baz  Bahadur surrendered to the Emperor Akbar in 1562.    At Ahmedabad, on the other hand, the Ahmed Shahi Sultans of Gujerat  found themselves in presence of an advanced form of Hindu civilisation  as soon as they entered into possession of the kingdom which they  snatched from the general conflagration. Whether Ahmedabad, which is  still the modern capital of Gujerat and ranks only second to its  neighbour, Bombay, as a centre of the Indian cotton industry, occupies  or not the exact site of the ancient Karn[=a]vati, Gujerat was a  stronghold of Indian culture long before the Mahomedan invasions.  Architecture especially had reached a very high standard of development  in the hands of what is usually known as the Jaina school. This is a  misnomer, for the school was in reality the product of a period rather  than a sect, though Jainism probably never enjoyed anywhere, or at any  time, such political ascendancy as in Gujerat under its Rashtrakuta and  Solanki rulers from the ninth to the thirteenth century, and seldom has  there been such an outburst of architectural activity as amongst the  Jains of that period. To the present day the _salats_ or builders,  mostly Jains, have in their keeping, jealously locked away in iron-bound  chests in their temples, many ancient treatises on civil and religious  architecture, of which only a few abstracts have hitherto been published  in Gujerati, but, as may be seen at Ahmedabad, in the great Jaina temple  of Hathi Singh, built in the middle of the last century at a cost of one  million sterling, they have preserved something of the ancient  traditions of their craft.    Firishta described Ahmedabad as, in his day, \"the handsomest city in  Hindustan and perhaps in the world,\" and very few Indian cities contain  so many beautiful buildings as those with which Ahmedabad was endowed in  the course of a few decades by its Ahmed Shahi rulers. No one can fail  to admire the wealth of ornamentation and the exquisite workmanship  lavished upon them, though they are not by any means the noblest  monuments of Mahomedan architecture in India. In fact--and herein lies  their peculiar interest--they are Hindu rather than Mahomedan in spirit.  For they were built by architects of the Jaina school, who were just as  ready to work for their Moslem rulers as they had been to work in  earlier times for their Hindu rajas. By the mere force of a civilisation  in many ways superior to that of their conquerors, these builders  imposed upon them, even in the very mosques which they built for them,  many of the most characteristic features of Hindu architecture. To  obtain, for instance, in a mosque the greater elevation required by the  Mahomedans, to whom the dim twilight of a Hindu shrine is repugnant,  they began by merely superimposing the shafts of two pillars, joining  them together with blocks to connect the base of the upper with the  capital of the lower shaft; and this feature in a less crude shape was  permanently retained in the Indo-Mahomedan architecture of Gujerat.  Nowhere better than at Ahmedabad can the various stages be followed  through which this adaptation of a purely Hindu style to Mahomedan  purposes has passed. It was at first somewhat violent and clumsy. The  earliest mosque in Ahmedabad, that of Ahmed Shah, is practically a Hindu  temple with a Mahomedan facade, and the figures of animals and of idols  can still be traced on the interior pillars. The octagonal tomb of Ganj  Bakhsh, the spiritual guide of Ahmed Shah, just outside the city at  Sarkhij, marks an immense stride, and the adjoining mosque, of which all  the pillars have the Hindu bracket capitals and all the domes are built  on traditional Hindu lines, retains nevertheless its Mahomedan  character. Still more wonderful is the blend achieved in the mosque and  tomb of Ranee Sepree, the consort of Mahmud Bigarah, who was perhaps the  most magnificent of the Mahomedan kings of Gujerat. It was completed in  1514, just a hundred years after the foundation of the Ahmed Shahi  dynasty, and it shows the distance travelled in the course of one  century towards something like a fusion of Hindu and Mahomedan ideals in  the domain at least of architecture.    In Bijapur alone, of all the great Mahomedan cities of that period which  I have seen, did the proud austerity of Mahomedan architecture shake  itself free from the complex and flamboyant suggestions of Hindu  art--perhaps because the great days of Bijapur came after it had taken  its full share of the spoils of Vijianagar, the last kingdom in Southern  India to perish by the sword of Islam. Having laid low the Hindu \"City  of Victory,\" the conquerors determined to make the Mahomedan \"City of  Victory\" eclipse the magnificence of all that they had destroyed. The  Gol Kumbaz, the great round dome over the lofty quadrangular hall in  which Sultan Mahomed Adil Shah lies under a plain slab of marble, is an  almost perfect hemisphere, which encloses the largest domed space in the  world, and it dominates the Deccan tableland just as the dome of St.  Peter's dominates the Roman Campagna. To such heights Hindu architecture  can never soar, for it eschews the arched dome; and beautiful as the  Hindu cupola may be with its concentric mouldings and the superimposed  circular courses horizontally raised on an octagonal architrave which  rests on symmetrical groups of pillars, it cannot attain anything like  the same bold span or the same lofty elevation.

This building is doubtless at least three hundred  years old. In this quarter of the city--in the rue de Bac, for  instance--you may find old, forbidding looking buildings, that within  are magnificent--perfect palaces; at the back of them, perhaps, will be  a splendid garden; but the whole thing is so hidden away that even the  very existence of such grandeur and beauty would never be suspected from  without.\"    He then led the way to the music-room, where we had an hour's talk.    [Illustration: HAROLD BAUER]    \"I was thinking as I drove down here,\" I began, \"what the trend of our  talk might be, for you have already spoken on so many subjects for  publication. It occurred to me to ask how you yourself secure a  beautiful tone on the piano, and how you teach others to make it?\"    Mr. Bauer thought an instant.    \"I am not sure that I do make it; in fact I do not believe in a single  beautiful tone on the piano. Tone on the piano can only be beautiful in  the right place--that is, in relation to other tones. You or I, or the  man in the street, who knows nothing about music, may each touch a piano  key, and that key will sound the same, whoever moves it, from the nature  of the instrument. A beautiful tone may result when two or more notes  are played successively, through their _difference of intensity_, which  gives variety. A straight, even tone is monotonous--a dead tone. Variety  is life. We see this fact exemplified even in the speaking voice; if one  speaks or reads in an even tone it is deadly monotonous.      VARIETY OF TONE    \"Now the singer or the violinist can make a single tone on his  instrument beautiful through variety; for it is impossible for him to  make even _one_ tone which does not have shades of variation in it,  however slight they may be, which render it expressive. But you cannot  do this on the piano: you cannot color a single tone; but you can do  this with a succession of tones, through their difference, through their  relation to each other. On the other hand you may say any tone is  beautiful if in the right place, no matter how harsh it may be. The  singer's voice may break from emotion, or simulated emotion, in an  impassioned phrase. The exact note on which it breaks may not be a  beautiful one, it may even be very discordant, but we do not think of  that, for we are moved by the meaning back of the tones. So on the piano  there may be one note in a phrase which, if heard alone, would sound  harsh and unpleasant, but in its relation to other tones it sounds  beautiful, for it gives the right meaning and effect. Thus it is the  _relation of tones_ which results in a 'beautiful tone' on the piano.    \"The frequent trouble is that piano teachers and players generally do  not understand their instrument. A singer understands his, a violinist,  flutist or drummer knows his, but not a pianist. As he only has keys to  put down and they are right under his hand, he does not bother himself  further. To obviate this difficulty, for those who come to me, I have  had this complete model of piano-key mechanism made. You see I can  touch the key in a variety of ways, and the results will be different  each time. It is necessary for the pianist to look into his instrument,  learn its construction, and know what happens inside when he touches a  key.    \"As you say, there are a great many methods of teaching the piano, but  to my mind they are apt to be long, laborious, and do not reach the  vital points. The pianist may arrive at these after long years of study  and experimenting, but much of his time will be wasted in useless labor.    \"In my own case, I was forced by necessity to make headway quickly. I  came to Paris years ago as a violinist, but there seemed no opening for  me then in that direction. There was opportunity, however, for ensemble  work with a good violinist and 'cellist. So I set to work to acquire  facility on the piano as quickly as possible. I consulted all the  pianists I knew--and I knew quite a number--as to what to do. They told  me I must spend many months on technic alone before I could hope to play  respectably, but I told them I had no time for that. So I went to work  to study out the effects I needed. It didn't matter to me _how_ my hand  looked on the keyboard; whether my fingers were curved, flat, or stood  on end. I was soon able to get my effects and to convince others that  they were the effects I wanted. Later on, when I had more leisure, I  took more thought about the position of hand and fingers. But I am  convinced that much time is spent uselessly on externals, which do not  reach the heart of the matter.    \"For instance, players struggle for years to acquire a perfectly even  scale. Now I don't believe in that at all. I don't believe a scale ever  should be even, either in tone or in rhythm. The beginner's untrained  efforts at a scale sound like this\"--the speaker illustrated at the  piano with a scale in which all the tones were blurred and run into each  other; then he continued, \"After a year's so-called 'correct training,'  his scale sounds like this\"--again he illustrated, playing a succession  of notes with one finger, each tone standing out by itself. \"To my  thinking such teaching is not only erroneous, it is positively  poisonous--yes, _poisonous_!\"    \"Is it to be inferred that you do not approve of scale practise?\"    \"Oh, I advise scale playing surely, for facility in passing the thumb  under and the hand over is very necessary. I do not, however, desire  the even, monotonous scale, but one that is full of variety and life.    \"In regard to interpretation, it should be full of tonal and rhythmic  modifications. Briefly it may be said that expression may be exemplified  in four ways: loud, soft, fast, and slow. But within these crude  divisions what infinite shades and gradations may be made! Then the  personal equation also comes in. Variety and differentiation are of  supreme importance--they are life!    \"I go to America next season, and after that to Australia; this will  keep me away from my Paris home for a long time to come. I should like  to give you a picture to illustrate this little talk. Here is a new one  which was taken right here in this room, as I sat at the piano, with the  strong sunlight pouring in at the big window at my left.\"           *       *       *       *       *    On a subsequent occasion, Mr. Bauer spoke further on some phases of his  art.    \"As you already know I do not believe in so-called 'piano technic,'  which must be practised laboriously outside of pieces. I do not believe  in spending a lot of time in such practise, for I feel it is time wasted  and leads nowhere. I do not believe, for instance, in the struggle to  play a perfectly even scale. A scale should never be 'even,' for it must  be full of variety and life. A perfectly even scale is on a dead level;  it has no life; it is machine-made. The only sense in which the word  'even' may be applied to a scale is for its rhythmic quality; but even  in this sense a beautiful scale has slight variations, so that it is  never absolutely regular, either in tone or rhythm.    \"Then I do not believe in taking up a new composition and working at the  technical side of it first. I study it in the first place from the  musical side. I see what may be the meaning of the music, what ideas it  seeks to convey, what was in the composer's mind when he wrote it. In  other words, I get a good general idea of the composition as a whole;  when I have this I can begin to work out the details.    \"In this connection I was interested in reading a statement made by  Ruskin in his _Modern Painters_. The statement, which, I think, has  never been refuted, is that while the great Italian painters, Raphael,  Coreggio, and the rest have left many immature and imperfect pictures  and studies in color, their drawings are mature and finished, showing  that they made many experiments and studies in color before they thought  of making the finished black and white drawing. It seems they put the  art thought first before the technical detail. This is the way I feel  and the way I work.      AVOID RESTRICTING RULES    \"Because our ancestors were brought up to study the piano a certain way,  and we--some of us--have been trained along the same rigid lines, does  not mean there are no better, broader, less limited ways of reaching the  goal we seek. We do not want to limit ourselves or our powers. We do not  need to say: 'Now I have thought out the conception of this composition  to my present satisfaction; I shall always play it the same way.' How  can we feel thus? It binds us at once with iron shackles. How can I play  the piece twice exactly alike? I am a different man to-day from what I  was yesterday, and shall be different to-morrow from what I am to-day.  Each day is a new world, a new life. Don't you see how impossible it is  to give two performances of the piece which shall be identical in every  particular? It _is_ possible for a machine to make any number of  repetitions which are alike, but a human, with active thought and  emotion, has a broader outlook.    \"The question as to whether the performer must have experienced every  emotion he interprets is as old as antiquity. You remember in the  Dialogues of Plato, Socrates was discussing with another sage the point  as to whether an actor must have felt every emotion he portrayed in  order to be a true artist. The discussion waxed warm on both sides.  Socrates' final argument was, If the true artist must have lived through  every experience in order to portray it faithfully, then, if he had to  act a death scene he would have to die first in order to picture it with  adequate fidelity!\"      THE QUESTION OF VELOCITY    In speaking of velocity in piano"]]]
