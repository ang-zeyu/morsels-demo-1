Henry VII. had been  pacific, but his death, in 1509, left James to face his hostile brother-  in-law, the fiery young Henry VIII.    In 1511 the Holy League under the Pope, against France, imperilled  James's French ally.  He began to build great ships of war; his  sea-captain, Barton, pirating about, was defeated and slain by ships  under two of the Howards, sons of the Earl of Surrey (August 1511).  James  remonstrated, Henry was firm, and the Border feud of Ker and Heron was  festering; moreover, Henry was a party to the League against France, and  France was urging James to attack England.  He saw, and wrote to the King  of Denmark, that, if France were down, the turn of Scotland to fall would  follow.  In March 1513, an English diplomatist, West, found James in a  wild mood, distraught \"like a fey man.\"    Chivalry, and even national safety, called him to war; while his old  remorse drove him into a religious retreat, and he was on hostile terms  with the Pope.  On May 24th, in a letter to Henry, he made a last attempt  to obtain a truce, but on June 30th Henry invaded France.  The French  queen despatched to James, as to her true knight, a letter and a ring.  He  sent his fleet to sea; it vanished like a dream.  He challenged Henry  through a herald on July 26th, and, in face of strange and evil omens,  summoned the whole force of his kingdom, crossed the Border on August  22nd, took Norham Castle on Tweed, with the holds of Eital, Chillingham,  and Ford, which he made his headquarters, and awaited the approach of  Surrey and the levies of the Stanleys.  On September 5th he demolished  Ford Castle, and took position on the crest of Flodden Edge, with the  deep and sluggish water of Till at its feet.  Surrey, commanding an army  all but destitute of supplies, outmanoeuvred James, led his men unseen  behind a range of hills to a position where, if he could maintain  himself, he was upon James's line of communications, and thence marched  against him to Branxton Ridge, under Flodden Edge.    James was ignorant of Surrey's movement till he saw the approach of his  standards.  In place of retaining his position, he hurled his force down  to Branxton, his gunners could not manage their new French ordnance, and  though Home with the Border spears and Huntly had a success on the right,  the Borderers made no more efforts, and, on the left, the Celts fled  swiftly after the fall of Lennox and Argyll.  In the centre Crawford and  Rothes were slain, and James, with the steady spearmen of his command,  drove straight at Surrey.  James, as the Spaniard Ayala said, \"was no  general: he was a fighting man.\"  He was outflanked by the Admiral  (Howard) and Dacre; his force was surrounded by charging horse and foot,  and rained on by arrows.  But       \"The stubborn spearmen still made good     Their dark impenetrable wood,\"    when James rushed from the ranks, hewed his way to within a lance's  length of Surrey (so Surrey writes), and died, riddled with arrows, his  neck gashed by a bill-stroke, his left hand almost sundered from his  body.  Night fell on the unbroken Scottish phalanx, but when dawn arrived  only a force of Border prickers was hovering on the fringes of the field.  Thirteen dead earls lay in a ring about their master; there too lay his  natural son, the young Archbishop of St Andrews, and the Bishops of  Caithness and the Isles.  Scarce a noble or gentle house of the Lowlands  but reckons an ancestor slain at Flodden.    Surrey did not pursue his victory, which was won, despite sore lack of  supplies, by his clever tactics, by the superior discipline of his men,  by their marching powers, and by the glorious rashness of the Scottish  king.  It is easy, and it is customary, to blame James's adherence to the  French alliance as if it were born of a foolish chivalry.  But he had  passed through long stress of mind concerning this matter.  If he  rejected the allurements of France, if France were overwhelmed, he knew  well that the turn of Scotland would come soon.  The ambitions and the  claims of Henry VIII. were those of the first Edwards.  England was bent  on the conquest of Scotland at the earliest opportunity, and through the  entire Tudor period England was the home and her monarch the ally of  every domestic foe and traitor to the Scottish Crown.    Scotland, under James, had much prospered in wealth and even in comfort.  Ayala might flatter in some degree, but he attests the great increase in  comfort and in wealth.    In 1495 Bishop Elphinstone founded the University of Aberdeen, while  (1496) Parliament decreed a course of school and college for the sons of  barons and freeholders of competent estate.  Prior Hepburn founded the  College of St Leonard's in the University of St Andrews; and in 1507  Chepman received a royal patent as a printer.  Meanwhile Dunbar, reckoned  by some the chief poet of Scotland before Burns, was already denouncing  the luxury and vice of the clergy, though his own life set them a bad  example.  But with Dunbar, Henryson, and others, Scotland had a school of  poets much superior to any that England had reared since the death of  Chaucer.  Scotland now enjoyed her brief glimpse of the Revival of  Learning; and James, like Charles II., fostered the early movements of  chemistry and physical science.  But Flodden ruined all, and the country,  under the long minority of James V., was robbed and distracted by English  intrigues; by the follies and loves of Margaret Tudor; by actual warfare  between rival candidates for ecclesiastical place; by the ambitions and  treasons of the Douglases and other nobles; and by the arrival from  France of the son of Albany, that rebel brother of James III.    The truth of the saying, \"Woe to the kingdom whose king is a child,\" was  never more bitterly proved than in Scotland between the day of Flodden  and the day of the return of Mary Stuart from France (1513-1561).  James  V. was not only a child and fatherless; he had a mother whose passions  and passionate changes in love resembled those of her brother Henry VIII.  Consequently, when the inevitable problem arose, was Scotland during the  minority to side with England or with France? the queen-mother wavered  ceaselessly between the party of her brother, the English king, and the  party of France; while Henry VIII. could not be trusted, and the policy  of France in regard to England did not permit her to offer any stable  support to the cause of Scottish independence.  The great nobles changed  sides constantly, each \"fighting for his own hand,\" and for the spoils of  a Church in which benefices were struggled for and sold like stocks in  the Exchange.    The question, Was Scotland to ally herself with England or with France?  later came to mean, Was Scotland to break with Rome or to cling to Rome?  Owing mainly to the selfish and unscrupulous perfidy of Henry VIII.,  James V. was condemned, as the least of two evils, to adopt the Catholic  side in the great religious revolution; while the statesmanship of the  Beatons, Archbishops of St Andrews, preserved Scotland from English  domination, thereby preventing the country from adopting Henry's Church,  the Anglican, and giving Calvinism and Presbyterianism the opportunity  which was resolutely taken and held.    The real issue of the complex faction fight during James's minority was  thus of the most essential importance; but the constant shiftings of  parties and persons cannot be dealt with fully in our space.  James's  mother had a natural claim to the guardianship of her son, and was left  Regent by the will of James IV., but she was the sister of Scotland's  enemy, Henry VIII.  Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow (later of St Andrews),  with the Earl of Arran (now the title of the Hamiltons), Huntly, and  Angus were to advise the queen till the arrival of Albany (son of the  brother of James III.), who was summoned from France.  Albany, of course,  stood for the French alliance, but when the queen-mother (August 6, 1514)  married the new young Earl of Angus, the grandson and successor of the  aged traitor, \"Bell the Cat,\" the earl began to carry on the usual  unpatriotic policy of his house.  The appointment to the see of St  Andrews was competed for by the Poet Gawain Douglas, uncle of the new  Earl of Angus; and himself of the English party; by Hepburn, Prior of St  Andrews, who fortified the Abbey; and by Forman, Bishop of Moray, a  partisan of France, and a man accused of having induced James IV. to  declare war against England.    After long and scandalous intrigues, Forman obtained the see.  Albany was  Regent for a while, and at intervals he repaired to France; he was in the  favour of the queen-mother when later she quarrelled with her husband,  Angus.  At one moment, Margaret and Angus fled to England where was born  her daughter Margaret, later Lady Lennox and mother of Henry Darnley.    Angus, with Home, now recrossed the Border (1516), and was reconciled to  Albany; against all unity in Scotland Henry intrigued, bribing with a  free hand, his main object being to get Albany sent out of the country.  In early autumn, 1516, Home, the leader of the Borderers at Flodden, and  his brother were executed for treason; in June, 1517, Albany went to seek  aid and counsel in France; when the queen-mother returned from England to  Scotland, where, if she retained any influence, she might be useful to  her brother's schemes.  But, contrary to Henry's interests, in this year  Albany renewed the old alliance with France; while, in 1518, the queen-  mother desired to divorce Angus.  But Angus was a serviceable tool of  Henry, who prevented his sister from having her way; and now the heads of  the parties in the distracted country were Arran, chief of the Hamiltons,  and Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#12)"],[1,"lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of  tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.    In the court-yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced  at Christmas round the Fir Tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.  One of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.    \"Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!\" said he,  trampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.    And the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in  the garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his dark  corner in the loft; he thought of his first youth in the wood, of the  merry Christmas-eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so  much pleasure to the story of Humpy-Dumpy.    \"'Tis over--'tis past!\" said the poor Tree. \"Had I but rejoiced when I  had reason to do so! But now 'tis past, 'tis past!\"    And the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a  whole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large  brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply! Each sigh was like a shot.    The boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star  on his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of his  life. However, that was over now--the Tree gone, the story at an end.  All, all was over--every tale must end at last.          THE SNOW QUEEN    FIRST STORY. Which Treats of a Mirror and of the Splinters    Now then, let us begin. When we are at the end of the story, we shall  know more than we know now: but to begin.    Once upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most  mischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good humor, for  he had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and  beautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but  that which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified  and increased in ugliness. In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes  looked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into  frights, or appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so  distorted that they were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole,  you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose  and mouth.    \"That's glorious fun!\" said the sprite. If a good thought passed through  a man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the sprite laughed  heartily at his clever discovery. All the little sprites who went to his  school--for he kept a sprite school--told each other that a miracle had  happened; and that now only, as they thought, it would be possible to  see how the world really looked. They ran about with the mirror; and at  last there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted  in the mirror. So then they thought they would fly up to the sky,  and have a joke there. The higher they flew with the mirror, the more  terribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast. Higher and higher  still they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the  mirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands  and fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more  pieces. And now it worked much more evil than before; for some of these  pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in  the wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed;  and then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye for that  which was evil. This happened because the very smallest bit had the  same power which the whole mirror had possessed. Some persons even got  a splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart  became like a lump of ice. Some of the broken pieces were so large that  they were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's  friends. Other pieces were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair  when people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. Then the  wicked sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his  fancy. The fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall  hear what happened next.      SECOND STORY. A Little Boy and a Little Girl    In a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people,  that there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden; and  where, on this account, most persons are obliged to content themselves  with flowers in pots; there lived two little children, who had a garden  somewhat larger than a flower-pot. They were not brother and sister; but  they cared for each other as much as if they were. Their parents lived  exactly opposite. They inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of the  one house joined that of the other, and the gutter ran along the extreme  end of it, there was to each house a small window: one needed only to  step over the gutter to get from one window to the other.    The children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables  for the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides: there was a  rose in each box, and they grew splendidly. They now thought of placing  the boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window  to the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers. The tendrils  of the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long  branches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other: it  was almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were  very high, and the children knew that they must not creep over them; so  they often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other,  and to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play  delightfully. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The windows  were often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on the  stove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then they had a  capital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each peeped a gentle  friendly eye--it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking  out. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump, they  could get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to  go down the long stairs, and then up the long stairs again: and  out-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm.    \"It is the white bees that are swarming,\" said Kay's old grandmother.    \"Do the white bees choose a queen?\" asked the little boy; for he knew  that the honey-bees always have one.    \"Yes,\" said the grandmother, \"she flies where the swarm hangs in the  thickest clusters. She is the largest of all; and she can never remain  quietly on the earth, but goes up again into the black clouds. Many a  winter's night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in  at the windows; and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they  look like flowers.\"    \"Yes, I have seen it,\" said both the children; and so they knew that it  was true.    \"Can the Snow Queen come in?\" said the little girl.    \"Only let her come in!\" said the little boy. \"Then I'd put her on the  stove, and she'd melt.\"    And then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories.    In the evening, when little Kay was at home, and half undressed, he  climbed up on the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little  hole. A few snow-flakes were falling, and one, the largest of all,  remained lying on the edge of a flower-pot.    The flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a  young lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little  flakes like stars. She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of  ice, of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly,  like two stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. She  nodded towards the window, and beckoned with her hand. The little boy  was frightened, and jumped down from the chair; it seemed to him as if,  at the same moment, a large bird flew past the window.    The next day it was a sharp frost--and then the spring came; the sun  shone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests, the  windows were opened, and the little children again sat in their pretty  garden, high up on the leads at the top of the house.    That summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. The little girl had  learned a hymn, in which there was something about roses; and then she  thought of her own flowers; and she sang the verse to the little boy,  who then sang it with her:         \"The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,       And angels descend there the children to greet.\"    And the children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, looked  up at the clear sunshine, and spoke as though they really saw angels  there. What lovely summer-days those were! How delightful to be out in  the air, near the fresh rose-bushes, that seem as if they would never  finish blossoming!    Kay and Gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of birds;  and it was then--the clock in the church-tower was just striking  five--that Kay said, \"Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart; and now  something has got into my eye!\"    The little girl put her arms around his neck. He winked his eyes; now  there was nothing to be seen.    \"I think it is out now,\" said he; but it was not. It was just one of  those pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye;  and poor Kay had got another piece right in his heart. It will soon  become like ice. It did not hurt any longer, but there it was.    \"What are you crying for?\" asked he. \"You look so ugly! There's nothing  the matter with me. Ah,\" said he at once, \"that rose is cankered! And  look, this one is quite crooked! After all, these roses are very ugly!  They are just like the box they are planted in!\" And then he gave the  box a good kick with his foot, and pulled both the roses up.    \"What are"]]]
