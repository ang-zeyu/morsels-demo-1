The sword  had been in the family for generations, and when the Baron grew too old,  or rather when he turned away from active life, the second son claimed  it as the fittest to use it. The claim was tacitly allowed; at all  events, he had it, and meant to keep it.    In a corner stood his lance, long and sharp, for use on horse-back, and  by it his saddle and accoutrements. The helmet and the shirt of mail,  the iron greaves and spurs, the short iron mace to bang at the  saddle-bow, spoke of the knight, the man of horses and war.    Oliver's whole delight was in exercise and sport. The boldest rider, the  best swimmer, the best at leaping, at hurling the dart or the heavy  hammer, ever ready for tilt or tournament, his whole life was spent with  horse, sword, and lance. A year younger than Felix, he was at least ten  years physically older. He measured several inches more round the chest;  his massive shoulders and immense arms, brown and hairy, his powerful  limbs, tower-like neck, and somewhat square jaw were the natural  concomitants of enormous physical strength.    All the blood and bone and thew and sinew of the house seemed to have  fallen to his share; all the fiery, restless spirit and defiant temper;  all the utter recklessness and warrior's instinct. He stood every inch a  man, with dark, curling, short-cut hair, brown cheek and Roman chin,  trimmed moustache, brown eye, shaded by long eyelashes and well-marked  brows; every inch a natural king of men. That very physical  preponderance and animal beauty was perhaps his bane, for his comrades  were so many, and his love adventures so innumerable, that they left him  no time for serious ambition.    Between the brothers there was the strangest mixture of affection and  repulsion. The elder smiled at the excitement and energy of the younger;  the younger openly despised the studious habits and solitary life of the  elder. In time of real trouble and difficulty they would have been drawn  together; as it was, there was little communion; the one went his way,  and the other his. There was perhaps rather an inclination to detract  from each other's achievements that to praise them, a species of  jealousy or envy without personal dislike, if that can be understood.  They were good friends, and yet kept apart.    Oliver made friends of all, and thwacked and banged his enemies into  respectful silence. Felix made friends of none, and was equally despised  by nominal friends and actual enemies. Oliver was open and jovial; Felix  reserved and contemptuous, or sarcastic in manner. His slender frame,  too tall for his width, was against him; he could neither lift the  weights nor undergo the muscular strain readily borne by Oliver. It was  easy to see that Felix, although nominally the eldest, had not yet  reached his full development. A light complexion, fair hair and eyes,  were also against him; where Oliver made conquests, Felix was  unregarded. He laughed, but perhaps his secret pride was hurt.    There was but one thing Felix could do in the way of exercise and sport.  He could shoot with the bow in a manner till then entirely unapproached.  His arrows fell unerringly in the centre of the target, the swift deer  and the hare were struck down with ease, and even the wood-pigeon in  full flight. Nothing was safe from those terrible arrows. For this, and  this only, his fame had gone forth; and even this was made a source of  bitterness to him.    The nobles thought no arms worthy of men of descent but the sword and  lance; missile weapons, as the dart and arrow, were the arms of  retainers. His degradation was completed when, at a tournament, where he  had mingled with the crowd, the Prince sent for him to shoot at the  butt, and display his skill among the soldiery, instead of with the  knights in the tilting ring. Felix shot, indeed, but shut his eyes that  the arrow might go wide, and was jeered at as a failure even in that  ignoble competition. Only by an iron self-control did he refrain that  day from planting one of the despised shafts in the Prince's eye.    But when Oliver joked him about his failure, Felix asked him to hang up  his breastplate at two hundred yards. He did so, and in an instant a  shaft was sent through it. After that Oliver held his peace, and in his  heart began to think that the bow was a dangerous weapon.    \"So you are late again this morning,\" said Oliver, leaning against the  recess of the window, and placing his arms on it. The sunshine fell on  his curly dark hair, still wet from the river. \"Studying last night, I  suppose?\" turning over the parchment. \"Why didn't you ride into town  with me?\"    \"The water must have been cold this morning?\" said Felix, ignoring the  question.    \"Yes; there was a slight frost, or something like it, very early, and a  mist on the surface; but it was splendid in the pool. Why don't you get  up and come? You used to.\"    \"I can swim,\" said Felix laconically, implying that, having learnt the  art, it no more tempted him. \"You were late last night. I heard you put  Night in.\"    \"We came home in style; it was rather dusky, but Night galloped the  Green Miles.\"    \"Mind she doesn't put her hoof in a rabbit's hole, some night.\"    \"Not that. She can see like a cat. I believe we got over the twelve  miles in less than an hour. Sharp work, considering the hills. You don't  inquire for the news.\"    \"What's the news to me?\"    \"Well, there was a quarrel at the palace yesterday afternoon. The Prince  told Louis he was a double-faced traitor, and Louis told the Prince he  was a suspicious fool. It nearly came to blows, and Louis is banished.\"    \"For the fiftieth time.\"    \"This time it is more serious.\"    \"Don't believe it. He will be sent for again this morning; cannot you  see why?\"    \"No.\"    \"If the Prince is really suspicious, he will never send his brother into  the country, where he might be resorted to by discontented people. He  will keep him close at hand.\"    \"I wish the quarrelling would cease; it spoils half the fun; one's  obliged to creep about the court and speak in whispers, and you can't  tell whom you are talking to; they may turn on you if you say too much.  There is no dancing either. I hate this moody state. I wish they would  either dance or fight.\"    \"Fight! who?\"    \"Anybody. There's some more news, but you don't care.\"    \"No. I do not.\"    \"Why don't you go and live in the woods all by yourself?\" said Oliver,  in some heat.    Felix laughed.    \"Tell me your news. I am listening.\"    \"The Irish landed at Blacklands the day before yesterday, and burnt  Robert's place; they tried Letburn, but the people there had been  warned, and were ready. And there's an envoy from Sypolis arrived; some  think the Assembly has broken up; they were all at daggers drawn. So  much for the Holy League.\"    \"So much for the Holy League,\" repeated Felix.    \"What are you going to do to-day?\" asked Oliver, after awhile.    \"I am going down to my canoe,\" said Felix.    \"I will go with you; the trout are rising. Have you got any hooks?\"    \"There's some in the box there, I think; take the tools out.\"    Oliver searched among the tools in the open box, all rusty and covered  with dust, while Felix finished dressing, put away his parchment, and  knotted the thong round his chest. He found some hooks at the bottom,  and after breakfast they walked out together, Oliver carrying his rod,  and a boar-spear, and Felix a boar-spear also, in addition to a small  flag basket with some chisels and gouges.          CHAPTER III    THE STOCKADE      When Oliver and Felix started, they left Philip, the third and youngest  of the three brothers, still at breakfast. They turned to the left, on  getting out of doors, and again to the left, through the covered passage  between the steward's store and the kitchen. Then crossing the waggon  yard, they paused a moment to glance in at the forge, where two men were  repairing part of a plough.    Oliver must also look for a moment at his mare, after which they  directed their steps to the South Gate. The massive oaken door was open,  the bolts having been drawn back at hornblow. There was a guard-room on  one side of the gate under the platform in the corner, where there was  always supposed to be a watch.    But in times of peace, and when there were no apprehensions of attack,  the men whose turn it was to watch there were often called away for a  time to assist in some labour going forward, and at that moment were  helping to move the woolpacks farther into the warehouse. Still they  were close at hand, and had the day watchman or warder, who was now on  the roof, blown his horn, would have rushed direct to the gate. Felix  did not like this relaxation of discipline. His precise ideas were upset  at the absence of the guard; method, organization, and precision, were  the characteristics of his mind, and this kind of uncertainty irritated  him.    \"I wish Sir Constans would insist on the guard being kept,\" he remarked.  Children, in speaking of their parents, invariably gave them their  titles. Now their father's title was properly \"my lord,\" as he was a  baron, and one of the most ancient. But he had so long abnegated the  exercise of his rights and privileges, sinking the noble in the  mechanician, that men had forgotten the proper style in which they  should address him. \"Sir\" was applied to all nobles, whether they  possessed estates or not. The brothers were invariably addressed as Sir  Felix or Sir Oliver. It marked, therefore, the low estimation in which  the Baron was held when even his own sons spoke of him by that title.    Oliver, though a military man by profession, laughed at Felix's strict  view of the guards' duties.

The laps of the plates are 4 inches wide, and  riveted with 3/4 inch rivets, spaced 2-1/4 inch apart center to center.  The keel and stem are both in one piece, as shown, and to this the  garboard strake is to be fastened. The bilge pieces are riveted on to the  bilge, and made of 9 inches by 4-1/2 inches by 9/16 inch T-iron. A wooden  fender, 4 inches by 4 inches wood, is fitted on both sides of hull,  running from stern to stern, by 3 inches by 3-1/2 inches by 7/16 inch  L-iron top and bottom with the sheer as shown. The hull from water line  falls in as shown, so as to describe at midships an arc of 4 feet 6  inches, and a circular deck of 1/8 inch plate is riveted on the hull.  There are two man-holes, each 16 inches diameter in the clear, placed in  end plates of the circular deck as shown, and provided with covers 3/8  inch thick, secured by twenty screws 3/4 inch diameter. The edge of each  manhole is stiffened by a welded iron ring. The surface of the mooring  link that comes in contact with the shackle and mooring chain is steeled.  The gas holder rests upon a plate bent up on each side, and riveted to the  keelson, and is prevented from rolling by four gusset plates, with two  short pieces of angle iron riveted thereto at the ends and coming in  contact with the holder, and at the ends by angular plates, and angle iron  riveted on each side and riveted to the keelson. The superstructure  consists of four legs of angle iron 2-1/2 inches by 2-1/2 inches by 5/16  inch, the upper ends of the legs being attached to a square flanged plate  for supporting the lighting apparatus. Four wooden battens of pitch pine,  4 inches by 1-1/2 inches, and bolted on to each cant of the angle iron  superstructure, with 7/8 inch galvanized iron bolts and nuts.    [Illustration: GAS LIGHT BUOY.]           *       *       *       *       *          PROJECT FOR A ROADSTEAD AT HAVRE.      The present port of Havre is absolutely insufficient to answer the ever  increasing requirements of commerce. Its entrance, which is too narrow and  not deep enough, does not permit steamers to go in, come out, and perform  their evolutions with the rapidity required by our epoch. So they are  gradually abandoning our port, and going to load and unload at Anvers and  elsewhere. A large number of wise heads, who are anxious about the future  of this port and our national interests, have devoted themselves to  finding a means of enlarging it, not by dredging _new_ basins, which would  prove ruinous to the budget and useless in twenty years, but by installing  a true roadstead at the entrance to the present basins.    [Illustration: FIG 1.--PLAN OF THE PROJECTED ROADSTEAD AT HAVRE.]    Upon the maps of the hydrographic service may be seen, under the name of  the Little Roadstead, a vast extent of sea nearly two kilometers wide by  three to four in length, bounded upon one side by the heights of Heve and  St. Adresse, and upon the other by the rocky line of Eclat and of the  heights of the roadstead (Fig. 1). This Little Roadstead, so called, in  order to become a genuine one, would have to be protected against the  great waves of the open sea. To thus protect it, to close it as quickly  and as cheaply as possible--that is the problem.    In 1838, Charles de Massas presented a project (the first in order of  date), which consisted in constructing upon the Eclat reef a semi-lunate  dike, and a breakwater at Cape Heve. Moreover, upon the emergent parts of  the Eclat reef and heights of the roadstead he proposed to erect two  forts.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--LEWIS' FLOATING BREAKWATER.]    The defense of the port of Havre is a very important question, and one  that appears to be completely abandoned. Since Engineer Degaulle in 1808  advised the erection of a fort upon the Eclat, and requests have  periodically been made and projects drawn. The requests are forgotten, but  the drawings are in the Ministers' portfolios, and if France should  to-morrow have a war with a maritime power our great northern port might  be destroyed and burned by the smallest squadron.    Some years after Massas' project, two officers, Deloffre and Bleve, and an  engineer named Renaud, received a commission to search for a means of  closing a portion of Seine Bay. These gentlemen advised the erection of  two dikes, one on the Eclat shoal in the very axis of this reef, and the  other at Heve. Between these two masonry dikes was to be placed a floating  breakwater. This project, which was submitted to Admiral de Hell in 1845,  had a favorable reception, and the Admiral especially applauded the trial  of breakwaters, \"which were much talked of in England, although the  effects that they might produce were not well known.\" Deloffre, Bleve, and  Renauds' project comprised two forts--one to the north and the other to  the south of the roadstead. For a long time nothing more was said about  it, and it is only during recent years, when the peril has become imminent  for Havre (threatened as it is of being abandoned even by the French  transatlantics), that the question has again became the order of the day.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--FROIDEVILLE'S FLOATING BREAKWATER.--END VIEW.]    Mr. Bert, a merchant, would protect the Little Roadstead by means of two  jetties, 1,000 and 1,600 meters in length, built, one of them upon the  Eclat and the other upon the eminences of the roadstead. These would be  constructed by forming a foundation of loose rocks, and using earth and  brick above the level of the water. Mr. Vial has likewise proposed a  rockwork of 2,000 meters in length, to form a dike 10 meters in height and  width, whose platform would be on a level with the highest tides.    Next comes the more recent project of Mr. Coulon. Seeing that it is the  deposits of the ocean and not those of the Seine that accumulate upon the  estuary, Mr. Coulon advises the construction of a dike about 2,000 meters  in length, starting from the Havre jetty, and ending at the southwest  extremity of the shoals at the roadstead heights, and a second one  returning toward the northwest, of from 500 to 1,000 meters. A third and  very long one of not less than 8 kilometers would be built from Honfleur  to the Ratier shoals.    This latter one, in contracting the bay, would contribute to increase the  force of the current, which, throwing back at the ocean its mud and  pebbles, would give us the depths of 15 and 20 meters indicated on the map  of Beautemps-Beaupre.    This year, again, two projects have arisen; one of them due to Mr.  Thuillard-Froideville, and the other to Mr. Hersent.    According to Mr. Hersent, it would be necessary to surround the Little  Roadstead with an insubmersible dike built upon the rocky shoals, which  would begin at Cape Heve (which it would consolidate) and end opposite the  entrance to the port at 1,600 meters from the jetties. Through it there  would be five passages. Afterward another dike would be constructed,  starting from the shore and running to meet the jetty designed to inclose  the Little Roadstead. On turning the angle at which it met the jetty it  would be continued as far as to Berville. Finally, a third dike, running  from Honfleur to Berville, would complete the system.    Mr. Hersent's project, which is one of the most remarkable of those that  have been proposed, has one fault, and that is that it would require  twelve years of work, and cost 158 million francs.    Mr. Thuillard-Froideville, completely renouncing masonry dikes as being  too costly and taking too long to construct, proposes to inclose the Havre  roadstead by means of floating breakwaters. As we have already seen, the  use of these between Cape Heve and the Eclat shoals had already been  proposed in 1845. As the project was abandoned, the models of these  breakwaters are rare.    In Bouniceau's \"Marine Constructions\" we find a curious figure, a sort of  open framework of clumsy form anchored in a singular manner, and  surmounted by rooms for watchmen, semaphores, posts for the shipwrecked,  etc. It is, indeed, the most complicated and most impracticable type that  could be imagined.    Mr. Lewis' model, which was exhibited last year at the International  Fisheries Exhibition, was, on the contrary, one of the simplest. It  consisted of a strong piece of wood of nearly triangular section, the  sharpest angle of which, being turned oceanward, was designed to cut the  waves and cause them to break over it (Fig. 2). If, by favor of divine  Providence, this breakwater, which presents absolutely plane surfaces to  the shock and pressure of the waves, is not broken to fragments in the  first tempest, it will certainly acquit itself of the _role_ for which the  inventor destined it. When we have a system of resistance to the sea,  anchored and facing a certain direction, and consequently not being able  to revolve around its axis as vessels do, care must be taken not to give  it entire surfaces.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--FROIDEVILLE'S BREAKWATER.--MODE OF JOINING THE  PARTS.]    Mr. Froideville's breakwater consists of a framework 25 meters in length,  and 9 in height and width, and having the form of an irregular 5-sided  prism (Fig. 3). The smallest side of the prism is designed to serve as a  flat keel. The axis is formed of a metallic float, from whence start radii  that form the skeleton of the framework, and that are designed for  connecting the center with five long spruce beams that form the angles of  the prism. To these beams are affixed the cross pieces that form the  openwork sides. Five long pieces of wood parallel with the beams, but not  so strong as they, protect the cross pieces and secure them against  breakage in the middle. All the angles of the breakwater and all points of  juncture of the pieces are protected with iron, and it is in order to  counterbalance the weight of all this iron that the central float is  used.
