They were  Christina and Sophie and Sadie and Alexandra--as we soon learned. It was  wonderful how welcome Gerda made them, and how quickly they were \"at  home.\" They rustled through the halls, chatting and laughing and  humming. Such merry girls! Such light-hearted little charmers! Letitia  stood looking at them through the crack of the drawing-room door.  Perhaps it was just as well that somebody should have a good time in our  house.    \"Just the same, Letitia,\" I observed, galled, \"I think I should say  to-morrow that this invasion is most impertinent--most uncalled for.\"    \"Yes, Archie,\" said Letitia demurely, \"you think you should say it. But  please don't think _I_ shall, for I assure you that I shan't. I suppose  that we must discharge her. She can't do anything and she doesn't want  to learn. I don't blame her. She can always get the wages she asks by  doing nothing. You would pursue a similar policy, Archie, if it were  possible. Everybody would. But all other laborers must know how to  labor.\"    I was glad to hear Letitia echoing my sentiments. She was quite  unconsciously plagiarizing. Once again she took up the cook-book. The  sound of merrymaking in the kitchen drifted in upon us. From what we  could gather, Gerda seemed to be \"dressing up\" for the delectation of  her guests. Shrieks of laughter and clapping of hands made us wince. My  nerves were on edge. Had any one at that moment dared to suggest that  there was even a suspicion of humor in these proceedings I should have  slain him without compunction. Letitia was less irate and tried to  comfort me.    Letitia sighed, and shut up the cook-book. Eggs _a la reine_ seemed as  difficult as trigonometry, or conic sections, or differential  calculus--and much more expensive. Certainly the eight giggling cooks in  the kitchen, now at the very height of their exhilaration, worried  themselves little about such concoctions. My nerves again began to play  pranks. The devilish pandemonium infuriated me. Letitia was tired and  wanted to go to bed. I was tired and hungry and disillusioned. It was  close upon midnight and the Swedish Thursday was about over. I thought  it unwise to allow them even an initial minute of Friday. When the clock  struck twelve, I marched majestically to the kitchen, threw open the  door, revealed the octette in the enjoyment of a mound of ice-cream and  a mountain of cake--that in my famished condition made my mouth  water--and announced in a severe, yet subdued tone, that the revel must  cease.    \"You must go at once,\" I said, \"I am going to shut up the house.\"    Then I withdrew and waited. There was a delay, during which a Babel of  tongues was let loose, and then Miss Lyberg's seven guests were heard  noisily leaving the house. Two minutes later, there was a knock at our  door and Miss Lyberg appeared, her eyes blazing, her face flushed and  the expression of the hunted antelope defiantly asserting that it would  never be brought to bay, on her perspiring features.    \"You've insulted my guests!\" she cried, in English as good as my own.  \"I've had to turn them out of the house, and I've had about enough of  this place.\"    Letitia's face was a psychological study. Amazement, consternation,  humiliation--all seemed determined to possess her. Here was the obtuse  Swede, for whose dear sake she had dallied with the intricacies of the  language of Stockholm, furiously familiar with admirable English! The  dense, dumb Scandinavian--the lady of the \"me no understand\"  rejoinder--apparently had the \"gift of tongues.\" Letitia trembled.  Rarely have I seen her so thoroughly perturbed. Yet seemingly she was  unwilling to credit the testimony of her own ears, for with sudden  energy, she confronted Miss Lyberg, and exclaimed imperiously, in  Swedish that was either pure or impure: \"_Tig. Ga din vaeg!_\"    \"Ah, come off!\" cried the handmaiden insolently. \"I understand English.  I haven't been in this country fifteen years for nothing. It's just on  account of folks like you that poor hard-working girls, who ain't  allowed to take no baths or entertain no lady friends, have to protect  themselves. Pretend not to understand them, says I. I've found it worked  before this. If they think you don't understand 'em, they'll let you  alone and stop worriting. It's like your impidence to turn my  lady-friends out of this flat. It's like your impidence. I'll--\"    Letitia's crestfallen look, following upon her perturbation, completely  upset me. A wave of indignation swamped me. I advanced, and in another  minute Miss Gerda Lyberg would have found herself in the hall, impelled  there by a persuasive hand upon her shoulder. However, it was not to be.    \"You just lay a hand on me,\" she said with cold deliberation, and a  smile, \"and I'll have you arrested for assault. Oh, I know the law. I  haven't been in this country fifteen years for nothing. The law looks  after poor weak, Swedish girls. Just push me out. It's all I ask. Just  you push me out.\"    She edged up to me defiantly. My blood boiled. I would have mortgaged  the prospects of my _Lives of Great Men_ (not that they were worth  mortgaging) for the exquisite satisfaction of confounding this  abominable woman. Then I saw the peril of the situation. I thought of  horrid headliners in the papers: \"Author charged with abusing servant  girl,\" or, \"Arrest of Archibald Fairfax on serious charge,\" and my mood  changed.    \"I understood you all the time,\" continued Miss Lyberg insultingly. \"I  listened to you. I knew what you thought of me. Now I'm telling you what  I think of you. The idea of turning out my lady-friends, on a Thursday  night, too! And me a-slaving for them, and a-bathing for them, and  a-treating them to ice cream and cake, and in me own kitchen. You ain't  no lady. As for you\"--I seemed to be her particular pet--\"when I sees a  man around the house all the time, a-molly-coddling and a-fussing, I  says to myself, he ain't much good if he can't trust the women folk  alone.\"    We stood there like dummies, listening to the tirade. What could we do?  To be sure, there were two of us, and we were in our own house. The  antagonist, however, was a servant, not in her own house. The situation,  for reasons that it is impossible to define, was hers. She knew it, too.  We allowed her full sway, because we couldn't help it. The sympathy of  the public, in case of violent measures, would not have been on our  side. The poor domestic, oppressed and enslaved, would have appealed to  any jury of married men, living luxuriously in cheap boarding-houses!    When she left us, as she did when she was completely ready to do so,  Letitia began to cry. The sight of her tears unnerved me, and I checked  a most unfeeling remark that I intended to make to the effect that, \"if  the wind be favorable, we shall be at Gothenburg in forty hours.\"    \"It's not that I mind her insolence,\" she sobbed, \"we were going to send  her off anyway, weren't we? But it's so humiliating to be 'done.' We've  been 'done.' Here have I been working hard at Swedish--writing exercises,  learning verbs, studying proverbs--just to talk to a woman who speaks  English as well as I do. It's--it's--so--so--mor--mortifying.\"    \"Never mind, dear,\" I said, drying her eyes for her; \"the Swedish will  come in handy some day.\"    \"No,\" she declared vehemently, \"don't say that you'll take me to Sweden.  I wouldn't go to the hateful country. It's a hideous language, anyway,  isn't it, Archie? It is a nasty, laconic, ugly tongue. You heard me say  _Tig_ to her just now. _Tig_ means 'be silent.' Could anything sound  more repulsive? _Tig! Tig! Ugh!_\"    Letitia stamped her foot. She was exceeding wroth.          SIMILAR CASES    BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN          There was once a little animal,        No bigger than a fox,      And on five toes he scampered        Over Tertiary rocks.      They called him Eohippus,        And they called him very small,      And they thought him of no value--        When they thought of him at all;      For the lumpish old Dinoceras        And Coryphodon so slow      Were the heavy aristocracy        In days of long ago.        Said the little Eohippus,        \"I am going to be a horse!      And on my middle finger-nails        To run my earthly course!      I'm going to have a flowing tail!        I'm going to have a mane!      I'm going to stand fourteen hands high        On the psychozoic plain!\"        The Coryphodon was horrified,        The Dinoceras was shocked;      And they chased young Eohippus,        But he skipped away and mocked;      Then they laughed enormous laughter,        And they groaned enormous groans,      And they bade young Eohippus        Go view his father's bones:      Said they, \"You always were as small        And mean as now we see,      And that's conclusive evidence        That you're always going to be:      What! Be a great, tall, handsome beast,        With hoofs to gallop on?      _Why, you'd have to change your nature!_\"        Said the Loxolophodon:      They considered him disposed of,        And retired with gait serene;      That was the way they argued        In \"the early Eocene.\"        There was once an Anthropoidal Ape,        Far smarter than the rest,      And everything that they could do        He always did the best;      So they naturally disliked him,        And they gave him shoulders cool,      And when they had to mention him        They said he was a fool.        Cried this pretentious Ape one day,        \"I'm going to be a Man!      And stand upright, and hunt, and fight,        And conquer all I can!      I'm going to cut down forest trees,        To make my houses higher!      I'm going to kill the Mastodon!        I'm going to make a fire!\"        Loud screamed the Anthropoidal Apes,        With laughter wild and gay;      They tried to catch that boastful one,        But he always got away;      So they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18477"],[0,"The Science of Human Nature (#12)"],[1,"the streets and form a club or gang. Through this  organization the boy's nature expresses itself. Without proper guidance  from older people, this expression takes a direction not good for the  future character and usefulness of the boy.    The social life of children should be provided for by the school in  cooeperation with the home. The school or the schoolroom should  constitute a social unit. The teacher with the parents should plan the  social life of the children. The actual work of the school can be very  much socialized. There can be much more cooeperation and much more group  work can be done in the school than is the case at present. And many  other social activities can be organized in connection with the school  and its work. Excursions, pageants, shows, picnics, and all sorts of  activities should be undertaken.    The schoolhouse should be used by the community as the place for many of  its social acts and performances. Almost every night, and throughout the  summer as well as in the winter, the people, young and old, should meet  at the school for some sort of social work or play. The Boy Scouts  should be brought under the control of the school to help fulfill some  of its main purposes.    =Environmental Instincts.= In this class there are at least two tendencies  which seem to be part of the original nature of man; namely, the  _wandering_ and the _collecting_ tendencies.    _Wandering._ The long life that our ancestors lived free and  unrestrained in the woods has left its effect within us. One of the  greatest achievements of civilization has been to overcome the inherited  tendencies to roam and wander, to the extent that for the most part we  live out our lives in one home, in one family, doing often but one kind  of work all our lives. Originally, man had much more freedom to come and  go and do whatever he wished.    Truancies and runaways are the result of original tendencies and desires  expressing themselves in spite of training, perhaps sometimes because of  the lack of training. In childhood and youth these original tendencies  should, to some extent, be satisfied in legitimate ways. Excursions and  picnics can be planned both for work and for play. If the child's  desires and needs can be satisfied in legitimate ways, then he will not  have to satisfy them illegitimately. The teaching itself can be done  better by following, to some extent, the lead of the child's nature.  Much early education consists in learning the world. Now, most of the  world is out of doors and the child must go out to find it. The teacher  should make use of the natural desires of the children to wander and  explore, as a means of educating them. The school work should be of such  a nature that much outdoor work will need to be done.    _Collecting._ It is in the nature of children to seize and, if possible,  carry away whatever attracts attention. This tendency is the basis of  what is called the collecting instinct. If one will take a walk with a  child, one can observe the operation of the collecting tendency,  particularly if the walk is in the fields and woods. The child will be  observed to take leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, nuts, pebbles, and in  fact everything that is loose or can be gotten loose. They are taken at  first aimlessly, merely because they attract attention. The original,  natural response of the child toward that which attracts attention is  usually to get it, get possession of it and take it along. It is easy to  see why such tendencies were developed in man. In his savage state it  was highly useful for him to do this. He must always have been on the  lookout for things which could be used as food or as weapons. He had to  do this to live. But one need not take a child to the woods to observe  this tendency. One can go to the stores. Till a child is trained not to  do it, he seizes and takes whatever attracts attention.    Just as the wandering tendencies can be used for the benefit of the  child, so can the collecting tendencies. Not only should the children  make expeditions to learn of the world, but specimens should be  collected so that they can be used to form a museum at the school which  will represent the surrounding locality. Geological, geographical,  botanical, and zooelogical specimens should be collected. The children  will learn much while making the collections, and much from the  collections after they are made.    \"Education could profit greatly by making large demands upon the  collecting instinct. It seems clear that in their childhood is the time  when children should be sent forth to the fields and woods, to study  what they find there and to gather specimens. The children can form  naturalists' clubs for the purpose of studying the natural environment.  Such study should embrace rocks, soils, plants, leaves, flowers, fruits,  and specimens of the wood of the various trees. Birds and insects can be  studied and collected. The work of such a club would have a twofold  value. (1) The study and collecting acquaint the child with his natural  environment, and in doing it, afford a sphere for the activity of many  aspects of his nature. They take him out of doors and give an  opportunity for exploring every nook and corner of the natural  environment. The collecting can often be done in such a way as to appeal  to the group instincts. For example, the club could hold meetings for  exhibiting and studying the specimens, and sometimes the actual  collecting could be done in groups. (2) The specimens collected should  be put into the school museum, and the aim of this museum should be to  represent completely the local environment, the natural and physical  environment, and also the industrial, civil, and social environment. The  museum should be completely illustrative of the child's natural,  physical, and social surroundings. The museum would therefore be  educative in its making, and when it is made, it would have immense  value to the community, not only to the children but to all the people.  In this museum, of course, should be found the minerals, rocks, soils,  insects,--particularly those of economic importance,--birds, and also  specimens of the wild animals of the locality. If proper appeal is made  to the natural desire of the children, this instinct would soon be made  of service in producing a very valuable collection. The school museum in  which these specimens are placed should also include other classes of  specimens. There should be specimens showing industrial evolution, the  stages of manufacture of raw material, specimens of local historical  interest, pictures, documents, books. The museum should be made of such  a nature that parents would go there nearly as often as the children.  The school should be for the instruction of all the people of the  community. It should be the experiment station, the library, the  debating club, the art gallery for the whole community.\"[2]    [2] Pyle's _Outlines of Educational Psychology_, pp. 84-86.    =Imitation.= One of the fundamental original traits of human nature is the  tendency to imitate. Imitation is not instinctive in the strict meaning  of the word. Seeing a certain act performed does not, apart from  training and experience, serve as a stimulus to make a child perform a  similar act. Hearing a certain sound does not serve as a stimulus for  the production of the same sound. Nevertheless, there is in the human  child a tendency or desire to do what it sees others doing.    A few hours spent in observing children ought to convince any one of the  universality and of the strength of this tendency. As our experience  becomes organized, the idea of an act usually serves as the stimulus to  call it forth. However, this is not because the idea of an act, of  necessity, always produces the act. It is merely a matter of the  stimulus and the response _becoming connected in that way_ as the result  of experience. Our meaning is that an act can be touched off or prompted  by any stimulus. Our nervous organization makes this possible. The  particular stimulus that calls forth a particular response depends upon  how we have been trained, how we have learned. In most cases our acts  are coupled up with the ideas of the acts. We learn them that way.    In early life particularly, the connection between stimulus and response  is very close. When a child gets the idea of an act, he immediately  performs the act, if he knows how. Now, seeing another perform an act  brings the act clearly into the child's consciousness, and he proceeds  to perform it. But the act must be one which the child already knows how  to perform, otherwise his performance of it will be faulty and  incomplete. If he has never performed the particular act, seeing another  perform the act sets him to trying to do it and he may soon learn it. If  he successfully performs an act when he sees it done by another, the act  must be one which he already knows how to perform, and for whose  performance the idea has already served as a stimulus. Now if imitation  were instinctive in the strict sense, one could perform the act for the  first time merely from seeing another do it, without any previous  experience or learning. It is doubtful whether there are any such  inherited connections. It is, however, true that human beings are of  such a nature that, particularly in early life, they _like_ to do and  _want_ to do what they see others doing. This is one of the most  important aspects of human nature, as we shall see.    =Function and Importance of Imitation in Life.= Natural selection has  developed few aspects of human nature so important for survival as the  tendency to imitate, for this tendency quickly leads to a successful  adjustment of the child to the world in which he lives. Adult men and  women are successfully adjusted to their environment. Their adjustment  might be better, but it is good enough to keep them alive for a time.  Now,"]]]
