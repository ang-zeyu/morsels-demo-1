There was a howl of terror and a  sound of something rushing madly through the bushes.    The Panther flung his torch as far as he could in the direction of the  sounds and returned, laughing deep in his throat.    \"I think I came pretty near hittin' the master wolf with that,\" he said,  \"an' I guess he's good an' scared. But they'll come back after a while,  an' don't you forget it. For that reason, I think we'd better keep a  watch. We'll divide it into three hours apiece, an' we'll give you the  first, Ned.\"    Ned was glad to have the opening watch, as it would soon be over and  done with, and then he could sleep free from care about any watch to  come. The Panther and Obed rolled in their blankets, found sleep almost  instantly, and the boy, resolved not to be a careless sentinel, walked  in a circle just outside the fires.    Sure enough, and just as the Panther had predicted, he saw the red eyes  and dusky forms again. Now and then he heard a faint pad among the  bushes, and he knew that a wolf had made it. He merely changed from the  outside to the inside of the fire ring, and continued his walk. With the  fire about him and his friends so near he was not afraid of wolves, no  matter how big and numerous they might be.    Yet their presence in the bushes, the light shuffle of their feet and  their fiery eyes had an uncanny effect. It was unpleasant to know that  such fierce beasts were so near, and he gave himself a reassuring glance  at the sleeping forms of his partners. By and by the red eyes melted  away, and he heard another soft tread, but heavier than that of the  wolves. With his rifle lying in the hollow of his arm and his finger on  the trigger he looked cautiously about the circle of the forest.    Ned's gaze at last met that of a pair of red eyes, a little further  apart than those of the wolves. He knew then that they belonged to a  larger animal, and presently he caught a glimpse of the figure. He was  sure that it was a puma or cougar, and so far as he could judge it was a  big brute. It, too, must be very hungry, or it would not dare the fire  and the human odor.    Ned felt tentatively of his rifle, but changed his mind. He remembered  the Panther's exploit with the firebrand, and he decided to imitate it,  but on a much larger scale. He laid down his rifle, but kept his left  hand on the butt of the pistol in his belt. Then selecting the largest  torch from the fire he made a rush straight for the blazing eyes,  thrusting the flaming stick before him. There was a frightened roar, and  then the sound of a heavy body crashing away through the undergrowth.  Ned returned, satisfied that he had done as well as the Panther and  better.    Both the Panther and Obed were awake and sitting up. They looked  curiously at Ned, who still carried the flaming brand in his hand.    \"A noise like the sound of thunder away off wakened me up,\" said the  Panther. \"Now, what have you been up to, young 'un?\"    \"Me?\" said Ned lightly. \"Oh, nothing important. I wanted to make some  investigations in natural history out there in the bushes, and as I  needed a light for the purpose I took it.\"    \"An' if I'm not pressin' too much,\" said the Panther, in mock humility,  \"may I make so bold as to ask our young Solomon what is natural  history?\"    \"Natural history is the study of animals. I saw a panther in the bushes  and I went out there to examine him. I saw that he was a big fellow, but  he ran away so fast I could tell no more about him.\"    \"You scared him away with the torch instead of shooting,\" said Obed. \"It  was well done, but it took a stout heart. If he comes again tell him I  won't wake up until it's time for my watch.\"    He was asleep again inside of a minute, and the Panther followed him  quickly. Both men trusted Ned fully, treating him now as an experienced  and skilled frontiersman. He knew it, and he felt proud and encouraged.    The panther did not come back, but the wolves did, although Ned now paid  no attention to them. He was growing used to their company and the  uncanny feeling departed. He merely replenished the fires and sat  patiently until it was time for Obed to succeed him. Then he, too,  wrapped himself in his blankets and slept a dreamless sleep until day.    The remainder of the buffalo meat was taken away the next day, but  anticipating a long stay at the cabin they continued to hunt, both on  horseback and on foot. Two more buffalo cows fell to their rifles. They  also secured a deer, three antelope and a dozen wild turkeys.    Their hunting spread over two days, but when they were all assembled on  the third night at the cabin general satisfaction prevailed. They had  ranged over considerable country, and as game was plentiful and not  afraid the Panther drew the logical conclusion that man had been scarce  in that region.    \"I take it,\" he said, \"that the Mexicans are a good distance east, and  that the Lipans and Comanches are another good distance west. Just the  same, boys, we've got to keep a close watch, an' I think we've got more  to fear from raidin' parties of the Indians than from the Mexicans. All  the Mexicans are likely to be ridin' to some point on the Rio Grande to  meet the forces of Santa Anna.\"    \"I wish we had more horses,\" said Obed. \"We'd go that way ourselves and  see what's up.\"    \"Well, maybe we'll get 'em,\" said the Panther. \"Thar's a lot of horses  on these plains, some of which ought to belong to us an' we may find a  way of claimin' our rights.\"    They passed a number of pleasant days at the cabin and in hunting and  foraging in the vicinity. They killed more big game and the dressed  skins of buffalo, bear and deer were spread on the floor or were hung on  the walls. Wild turkeys were numerous, and they had them for food every  day. But they discovered no signs of man, white or red, and they would  have been content to wait there had they not been so anxious to  investigate the reported advance of Santa Anna on the Rio Grande.    Roylston was the most patient of them all, or at least he said the  least.    \"I think,\" he said about the fourth or fifth day, \"that it does not hurt  to linger here. The Mexican power has not yet gathered in full. As for  me, personally, it suits me admirably. I can walk a full two hundred  yards now, and next week I shall be able to walk a mile.\"    \"When we are all ready to depart, which way do you intend to go Mr.  Roylston?\" asked Ned.    \"I wish to go around the settlements and then to New Orleans,\" replied  Roylston. \"That city is my headquarters, but I also have establishments  elsewhere, even as far north as New York. Are you sure, Ned, that you  cannot go with me and bring your friend Allen, too? I could make men of  you both in a vast commercial world. There have been great  opportunities, and greater are coming. The development of this mighty  southwest will call for large and bold schemes of organization. It is  not money alone that I offer, but the risk, the hopes and rewards of a  great game, in fact, the opening of a new world to civilization, for  such this southwest is. It appeals to some deeper feeling than that  which can be aroused by the mere making of money.\"    Ned, deeply interested, watched him intently as he spoke. He saw  Roylston show emotion for the first time, and the mind of the boy  responded to that of the man. He could understand this dream. The image  of a great Texan republic was already in the minds of men. It possessed  that of Ned. He did not believe that the Texans and Mexicans could ever  get along together, and he was quite sure that Texas could never return  to its original position as part of a Mexican state.    \"You can do much for Texas there with me in New Orleans,\" said Roylston,  as if he were making a final appeal to one whom he looked upon almost as  a son. \"Perhaps you could do more than you can here in Texas.\"    Ned shook his head a little sadly. He did not like to disappoint this  man, but he could not leave the field. Young Allen also said that he  would remain.    \"Be it so,\" said Roylston. \"It is young blood. Never was there a truer  saying than 'Young men for war, old men for counsel.' But the time may  come when you will need me. When it does come send the word.\"    Ned judged from Roylston's manner that dark days were ahead, but the  merchant did not mention the subject again. At the end of a week, when  they were amply supplied with everything except horses, the Panther  decided to take Ned and Obed and go on a scout toward the Rio Grande.  They started early in the morning and the horses, which had obtained  plenty of grass, were full of life and vigor.    They soon left the narrow belt of forest far behind them, maintaining an  almost direct course toward the southeast. The point on the river that  they intended to reach was seventy or eighty miles away, and they did  not expect to cover the distance in less than two days.    They rode all that day and did not see a trace of a human being, but  they did see both buffalo and antelope in the distance.    \"It shows what the war has done,\" said the Panther. \"I rode over these  same prairies about a year ago an' game was scarce, but there were some  men. Now the men are all gone an' the game has come back. Cur'us how  quick buffalo an' deer an' antelope learn about these things.\"    They slept the night through on the open prairie, keeping watch by  turns. The weather was cold, but they had their good blankets with them  and they took no discomfort. They rode forward again early in the  morning, and about noon struck an old but broad trail. It was evident  that many men and many wagons had passed here. There were deep ruts in  the earth, cut by wheels, and the traces of footsteps showed over a  belt a quarter of a mile wide.    \"Well, Ned, I s'pose you can make a purty good guess what this means?\"  said the Panther.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic? (#12)"],[1,"of the  two concerns, the Government stepped in and informed the Overseas News  Agency that it could send only \"political news,\" while the Trans-ocean  was authorised to send \"economic and social news\" via Sayville and  Tuckerton.    This news, however, was not solely for the United States.  Krupp's eyes  were on Mexico and South America, so agents were appointed in  Washington and New York to send the Krupp-bred wireless news from New  York by cable to South America and Mexico.  Obviously the same news  which was sent to the United States could not be telegraphed to Mexico  and South America, because Germany had a different policy toward these  countries.  The United States was on record against an unlimited  submarine warfare.  Mexico and South America were not.  Brazil, which  has a big German population, was considered an un-annexed German  colony.  News to Brazil, therefore, had to be coloured differently than  news to New York.  Some of the colouring was done in Berlin; some in  New York by Krupp's agents here.  As a result of Germany's anti-United  States propaganda in South America and Mexico, these countries did not  follow President Wilson when he broke diplomatic relations with Berlin.  While public sentiment might have been against Germany, it was, to a  certain degree, antagonistic to the United States.    Obviously, Germany had to have friends in this country to assist her,  or what was being done would be traced too directly to the German  Government.  So Germany financed willing German-Americans in their  propaganda schemes.  And because no German could cross the ocean except  with a falsified neutral passport, Germany had to depend upon  German-Americans with American passports to bring information over.  These German-Americans, co-operating with some of the Americans in  Berlin, kept informing the Foreign Office, the army and navy as well as  influential Reichstag members that the real power behind the government  over here was not the press and public opinion but the nine million  Americans who were directly or indirectly related to Germany.  During  this time the Government felt so sure that it could rely upon the  so-called German-Americans that the Government considered them as a  German asset whenever there was a submarine crisis.    When Henry Morgenthau, former American Ambassador to Turkey, passed  through Berlin, en route to the United States, he conferred with  Zimmermann, who was then Under Secretary of State.  During the course  of one of their conversations Zimmermann said the United States would  never go to war with Germany, \"because the German-Americans would  revolt.\"  That was one of Zimmermann's hobbies.  Zimmermann told other  American officials and foreign correspondents that President Wilson  would not be able to bring the United States to the brink of war,  because the \"German-Americans were too powerful.\"    But Zimmermann was not making these statements upon his own authority.  He was being kept minutely advised about conditions here through the  German spy system and by German-American envoys, who came to Berlin to  report on progress the German-Americans were making here in politics  and in Congress.    Zimmermann was so \"dead sure\" he was right in expecting a large portion  of Americans to be disloyal that one time during a conversation with  Ambassador Gerard he said that he believed Wilson was only bluffing in  his submarine notes.  When Zimmermann was Under Secretary of State I  used to see him very often.  His conversation would contain questions  like these:    \"Well, how is your English President?  Why doesn't your President do  something against England?\"    Zimmermann was always in close touch with the work of Captains von  Papen and Boy-Ed when they were in this country.  He was one of the  chief supports of the little group of intriguers in Berlin who directed  German propaganda here.  Zimmermann was the man who kept Baron Mumm von  Schwarzenstein, former Ambassador to Tokyo, in the Foreign Office in  Berlin as chief of foreign propaganda and intrigue in America and  China.  Mumm had been here as Minister Extra-ordinary several years ago  and knew how Germany's methods could be used to the best purpose,  namely, to divide American sentiment.  Then, when Zimmermann succeeded  Jagow he ousted Mumm because Mumm had become unpopular with higher  Government authorities.    One day in Berlin, just before the recall of the former German military  and naval attaches in Washington, I asked Zimmermann whether Germany  sanctioned what these men had been doing.  He replied that Germany  approved everything they had done \"because they had done nothing more  than try to keep America out of the war; to prevent American goods  reaching the Allies and to persuade Germans and those of German descent  not to work in ammunition factories.\"  The same week I overheard in a  Berlin cafe two reserve naval officers discuss plans for destroying  Allied ships sailing from American ports.  One of these men was an  escaped officer of an interned liner at Newport News.  He had escaped  to Germany by way of Italy.  That afternoon when I saw Ambassador  Gerard I told him of the conversation of these two men, and also what  Zimmermann had said.  The Ambassador had just received instructions  from Washington about Boy-Ed and von Papen.    Gerard was furious.    \"Go tell Zimmermann,\" he said, \"for God's sake to leave America alone.  If he keeps this up he'll drag us into the war.  The United States  won't stand this sort of thing indefinitely.\"    That evening I went back to the Foreign Office and saw Zimmermann for a  few minutes.  I asked him why it was that Germany, which was at peace  with the United States, was doing everything within her power to make  war.    \"Why, Germany is not doing anything to make you go to war,\" he replied.  \"Your President seems to want war.  Germany is not responsible for what  the German-Americans are doing.  They are your citizens, not ours.  Germany must not be held responsible for what those people do.\"    Had it not been for the fact that the American Government was fully  advised about Zimmermann's intrigues in the United States this remark  might be accepted on its face.  The United States knew that Germany was  having direct negotiations with German-Americans in the United States.  Men came to Germany with letters of introduction from leading  German-Americans here, with the expressed purpose of trying to get  Germany to stop its propaganda here.  What they did do was to assure  Germany that the German-Americans would never permit the United States  to be drawn into the war.  Because of their high recommendations from  Germans here some of them had audiences with the Kaiser.    Germany had been supporting financially some Americans, as the State  Department has proof of checks which have been given to American  citizens for propaganda and spy work.    I know personally of one instance where General Director Heinicken, of  the North German-Lloyd, gave an American in Berlin $1,000 for his  reports on American conditions.  The name cannot be mentioned because  there are no records to prove the transaction, although the man  receiving this money came to me and asked me to transmit $250 to his  mother through the United Press office.  I refused.    When Zimmermann began to realise that Germany's threatening propaganda  in the United States and Germany's plots against American property were  not succeeding in frightening the United States away from war, he began  to look forward to the event of war.  He saw, as most Germans did, that  it would be a long time before the United States could get forces to  Europe in a sufficient number to have a decisive effect upon the war.  He began to plan with the General Staff and the Navy to league Mexico  against America for two purposes.  One, Germany figured that a war with  Mexico would keep the United States army and navy busy over here.  Further, Zimmermann often said to callers that if the United States  went to war with Mexico it would not be possible for American factories  to send so much ammunition and so many supplies to the Allies.    German eyes turned to Mexico.  As soon as President Wilson recognised  Carranza as President, Germany followed with a formal recognition.  Zubaran Capmany, who had been Mexican representative in Washington, was  sent to Berlin as Carranza's Minister.  Immediately upon his arrival  Zimmermann began negotiations with him.  Reports of the negotiations  were sent to Washington.  The State Department was warned that unless  the United States solved the \"Mexican problem\" immediately Germany  would prepare to attack us through Mexico.  German reservists were  tipped off to be ready to go to Mexico upon a moment's notice.  Count  von Bernstorff and the German Consuls in the United States were  instructed, and Bernstorff, who was acting as the general director of  German interests in North and South America, was told to inform the  German officials in the Latin-American countries.  At the same time  German financial interests began to purchase banks, farms and mines in  Mexico.          CHAPTER V    THE DOWNFALL OF VON TIRPITZ AND VON FALKENHAYN    After the sinking of the _Arabic_ the German Foreign Office intimated  to the United States Government and to the American correspondents that  methods of submarine warfare would be altered and that ships would be  warned before they were torpedoed.  But when the Navy heard that the  Foreign Office was inclined to listen to Mr. Wilson's protests it made  no attempt to conceal its opposition.  Gottlieb von Jagow, the  Secretary of State, although he was an intimate friend of the Kaiser  and an officer in the German Army, was at heart a pacifist.  Every time  an opportunity presented itself he tried to mobilise the peace forces  of the world to make peace.  From time to time, the German financiers  and propaganda leaders in the"]]]
