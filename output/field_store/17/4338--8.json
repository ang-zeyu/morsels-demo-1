The moral was not lost upon Delarey, who  determined to try whether a better stand could not be made in a river  position, and selected the junction of the Modder and the Riet for the  experiment. His idea was not so much to dispute the passage of the river  as to use the deep channels as covered ways and as natural trenches from  which the plain could be grazed by rifle fire. The Modder after  approaching the Riet changes its direction abruptly three tunes above  the junction, enclosing a diamond-shaped area which provided the Boers  with a ready-made perimeter camp.    [Sidenote: Map. p. 59.]    Methuen, thinking that the enemy would as before select the good kopje  position which offered itself on Spytfontein halfway to Kimberley,  determined to diverge from the railway with the greater part of his army  and circling through Jacobsdaal, Brown's Drift and Abon's Dam to attack  Spytfontein in flank, where he had little doubt that he would find the  Boers in position; but Modder River, which he was inclined to believe  was only held as an advanced post, must first be taken. Delarey had been  joined by P. Cronje, who unperceived by Methuen's cavalry came in with a  body of Transvaalers from Mafeking, and was in occupation of the loop  between the rivers.    At sunrise on November 28 Methuen advanced from his camp at Witkoplaagte  six miles south of the river. The fight began under misapprehensions on  each side. Methuen believed that only the river bank above the railway  bridge was held in force; while he was credited by his opponents with  the intention of crossing the Riet River by Bosnian's Drift of which he  did not know the existence.    Everything promised well for Delarey and Cronje, but they made little  use of their opportunities. Methuen fought in the dark, and whenever the  Fog of War lifted, found that the situation had changed. He attacked the  Modder as the opening move of his flank march on a mythical position on  Spytfontein and suddenly discovered before him, not a mere advanced post  to be checked or masked, but an enemy holding a well-entrenched and  defended front several miles in length. The maps at his disposal did not  shew the extraordinary windings of the two rivers over part of the area  on which he was engaged, and some of the reaches were only discovered  when they tripped up the advancing troops. The result of a hard day's  work, in which Methuen was wounded, was the capture of Rosmead, a  village on the right bank below the railway bridge. The troops of the  right attack did not succeed in crossing the river, and an attempt to  work up the right bank from Rosmead failed. What effect the battle would  have upon the situation, and whether on the whole it had been a success  for Methuen, were not apparent at nightfall. The question was answered  next morning when it was found that the Boers had retired to Jacobsdaal.  Next day the British troops took up a position north of the river.    So far, the Kimberley relief force had done its work well. The obstacles  in its way at Belmont, Graspan, and Modder River had been thrust aside,  and it was now within two easy marches of its destination. It seemed  therefore that in three days at the most, allowing one day for another  battle, it would be reported to Buller as having finished its task: and  had the necessity been urgent the relief could no doubt have been  effected within that time. Kimberley, however, appeared able to take  care of itself for a few weeks, and Methuen halted for twelve days at  Modder River in order to receive supplies and reinforcements, and to  strengthen his slender and vulnerable line of communication with the  south. He still believed that the Boers would make their next stand at  Spytfontein.    The Boers remained but a few days at Jacobsdaal. After a council of war  at which Cronje declared himself in favour of remaining there as a  menace to the British line of communication which would attract Methuen  to the town, a movement which Methuen himself had had in mind; while  Delarey advocated the taking up of a position between the Modder River  and Kimberley; the plan of the latter was adopted and the Boer forces  trekked northwards to Spytfontein. They found, however, that between  Spytfontein and the river, the Magersfontein group of kopjes would  afford excellent positions to Methuen from which Spytfontein could be  attacked.    During Methuen's halt at Modder River Delarey and Cronje received  considerable reinforcements. From Natal, from the Basuto border, and  from Kimberley, commandos were summoned to Spytfontein. That position  was, however, for the reason just stated, insecure; and on the December  4 the Magersfontein position was taken up and prepared for defence by  Delarey. A low arc stretching from the position towards the Modder was  discovered, from which a flanking fire could be poured in upon a frontal  attack.    With an unerring instinct which was more useful to him than most of the  knowledge he could have acquired in a European Staff College, and with  an originality which if it had been displayed by a young British officer  in an examination for promotion would probably have injured that  officer's prospects, Delarey dug his trenches not at the foot of the  hill but in sinuous lines some little way in advance of it, by which he  gained the power of meeting an attack with grazing or skimming fire, and  which also removed the firing line from physical features on which the  British guns could be laid. It is said that he manned the works on the  slope with burghers firing black powder so as to draw the enemy's fire  away from the trenches in which only smokeless powder was used.    [Illustration: Modder River and Magersfontein.]    Methuen obtained little information during his halt at Modder River. The  country was so much intersected by the wire fences of the farms that  cavalry scouting was difficult. He decided to make a direct frontal  attack upon Magersfontein on December 11 after a bombardment on the  previous evening; and here, as at Colenso, the text-book preliminary  shrapnel practice put the enemy on the alert and did no harm. It greatly  encouraged the burghers in their trenches. Only three men were touched  by the projectiles hurled by the naval, howitzer, field, and horse  batteries; and an impending infantry advance was clearly indicated. To  the Highland Brigade under Wauchope, who had joined the command since  the Modder River battle, was entrusted the execution of the night  attack. He does not appear to have altogether approved of Methuen's  scheme; but with the same dogged valour which he displayed many years  before when he threw himself upon the Gladstonian political  Magersfontein in Midlothian, he incorporated himself in it.    At 1 a.m. on December 12 in a storm of rain and thunder the Brigade in  mass of quarter-columns marched out of its bivouac, guided by a staff  officer's compass which the lightning and the rain soon made unreliable.  The objective point was the southern edge of the Magersfontein Ridge,  about three miles distant. The progress made over the rough and  encumbered veld was slow, and it was difficult to judge in the darkness  how much ground had really been covered. Wauchope either underestimated  the distance made good or, as is more probable, did not expect to find  the enemy entrenched in advance of the foot of the hill, and the error  cost him his life and the lives of many other gallant Highlanders.  Afraid lest dawn should find his Brigade too far away from the position  to rush it, he hesitated to deploy, and when at last he was about to  give the order, a further delay was caused by a line of thorn bushes.  The Brigade passed through or avoided the obstruction and was at the  halt on the point of changing formation when the Boers in the advanced  trenches, which had been so stealthily excavated that no one in the  British Army seems to have been aware of their existence, received the  alarm and opened fire. Possibly the situation might have been saved if  an order to charge had been given at once, and the Highlanders had heard  the skirl of the pipes; but Wauchope had at the first shot rushed  forward impetuously towards the flashing Mausers. With his life he  measured the unknown distance to the trenches, and at the supreme moment  his Highlanders lost their leader and knew not whom to follow.    The sudden stroke of the impact falling upon men of dissimilar  temperament reacted on them diversely. The majority absorbed it by  throwing themselves upon the ground on which they stood; others recoiled  mechanically upon the companies in rear; while to not a few it was a  stimulus which projected them into the jaws of death gaping before them  in the dim light. A mixed body, hardly exceeding the strength of three  companies, pushed on in obedience to the last words that fell from  Wauchope's lips, to reinforce the right; and succeeded in wriggling  round the eastward flank of the enemy's advanced trenches and in  shattering a foreign contingent in the Boer service which was holding  the gap of level ground between the low arc and the Magersfontein Ridge.  The little force of progressives came under the fire of the British guns  which opened upon the ridge at daybreak, but a remnant under Wilson  drove a keen-edged but slender wedge into the curve of the Boer  position, and was favourably placed to storm the ridge. A few score of  Highlanders were now fingering the key with which it seemed possible to  unlock the sluice gates and allow the flood waters of war to overwhelm  the foe. But War is a game of chance. The key was snatched away and the  issue of the day reversed by a man who had lost his way.    In the absence of Delarey, who was absent at Kimberley, P. Cronje was in  chief"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#12)"],[1,"plenty to  wear, sufficient water to wash in, and a furnace in the cellar.  But  there was one deadly likeness.  Our lives were absolutely monotonous  and uneventful.  Nothing nice ever happened, except ice-cream on  Sundays, and even that was regular.  In all the eighteen years I was  there I only had one adventure--when the woodshed burned.  We had to  get up in the night and dress so as to be ready in case the house  should catch.  But it didn't catch and we went back to bed.    Everybody likes a few surprises; it's a perfectly natural human  craving.  But I never had one until Mrs. Lippett called me to the  office to tell me that Mr. John Smith was going to send me to college.  And then she broke the news so gradually that it just barely shocked me.    You know, Daddy, I think that the most necessary quality for any person  to have is imagination.  It makes people able to put themselves in  other people's places.  It makes them kind and sympathetic and  understanding.  It ought to be cultivated in children.  But the John  Grier Home instantly stamped out the slightest flicker that appeared.  Duty was the one quality that was encouraged.  I don't think children  ought to know the meaning of the word; it's odious, detestable.  They  ought to do everything from love.    Wait until you see the orphan asylum that I am going to be the head of!  It's my favourite play at night before I go to sleep.  I plan it out to  the littlest detail--the meals and clothes and study and amusements and  punishments; for even my superior orphans are sometimes bad.    But anyway, they are going to be happy.  I think that every one, no  matter how many troubles he may have when he grows up, ought to have a  happy childhood to look back upon.  And if I ever have any children of  my own, no matter how unhappy I may be, I am not going to let them have  any cares until they grow up.

These are the  kind of callers we entertain now that warm weather has come and the  windows stay open--                                                   Saturday morning    Perhaps you think, last night being Friday, with no classes today, that  I passed a nice quiet, readable evening with the set of Stevenson that  I bought with my prize money?  But if so, you've never attended a  girls' college, Daddy dear.  Six friends dropped in to make fudge, and  one of them dropped the fudge--while it was still liquid--right in the  middle of our best rug.  We shall never be able to clean up the mess.    I haven't mentioned any lessons of late; but we are still having them  every day.

It contains all necessary facts, but no  unnecessary verbiage.    I. We had written examinations this week in:         A. Chemistry.         B. History.    II.  A new dormitory is being built.         A. Its material is:             (a) red brick.             (b) grey stone.         B.

Good night.                                               Judy                                                         2nd June    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    You will never guess the nice thing that has happened.    The McBrides have asked me to spend the summer at their camp in the  Adirondacks!  They belong to a sort of club on a lovely little lake in  the middle of the woods.  The different members have houses made of  logs dotted about among the trees, and they go canoeing on the lake,  and take long walks through trails to other camps, and have dances once  a week in the club house--Jimmie McBride is going to have a college  friend visiting him part of the summer, so you see we shall have plenty  of men to dance with.    Wasn't it sweet of Mrs. McBride to ask me?  It appears that she liked  me when I was there for Christmas.    Please excuse this being short.  It isn't a real letter; it's just to  let you know that I'm disposed of for the summer.                       Yours,                         In a VERY contented frame of mind,                                                     Judy                                                             5th June    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Your secretary man has just written to me saying that Mr. Smith prefers  that I should not accept Mrs. McBride's invitation, but should return  to Lock Willow the same as last summer.    Why, why, WHY, Daddy?    You don't understand about it.  Mrs. McBride does want me, really and  truly.  I'm not the least bit of trouble in the house.  I'm a help.  They don't take up many servants, and Sallie an I can do lots of useful  things.  It's a fine chance for me to learn housekeeping.  Every woman  ought to understand it, and I only know asylum-keeping.    There aren't any girls our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants me  for a companion for Sallie.  We are planning to do a lot of reading  together.  We are going to read all of the books for next year's  English and sociology.  The Professor said it would be a great help if  we would get our reading finished in the summer; and it's so much  easier to remember it if we read together and talk it over.    Just to live in the same house with Sallie's mother is an education.  She's the most interesting, entertaining, companionable, charming woman  in the world; she knows everything.  Think how many summers I've spent  with Mrs. Lippett and how I'll appreciate the contrast.  You needn't be  afraid that I'll be crowding them, for their house is made of rubber.  When they have a lot of company, they just sprinkle tents about in the  woods and turn the boys outside.  It's going to be such a nice, healthy  summer exercising out of doors every minute.  Jimmie McBride is going  to teach me how to ride horseback and paddle a canoe, and how to shoot  and--oh, lots of things I ought to know.  It's the kind of nice, jolly,  care-free time that I've never had; and I think every girl deserves it  once in her life.  Of course I'll do exactly as you say, but please,  PLEASE let me go, Daddy.  I've never wanted anything so much.    This isn't Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you.  It's just Judy--a girl.                                                       9th June    Mr. John Smith,    SIR:  Yours of the 7th inst. at hand.  In compliance with the  instructions received through your secretary, I leave on Friday next to  spend the summer at Lock Willow Farm.    I hope always to remain,                                 (Miss) Jerusha Abbott                                                      LOCK WILLOW FARM,                                                 3rd August    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    It has been nearly two months since I wrote, which wasn't nice of me, I  know, but I haven't loved you much this summer--you see I'm being frank!    You can't imagine how disappointed I was at having to give up the  McBrides' camp.  Of course I know that you're my guardian, and that I  have to regard your wishes in all matters, but I couldn't see any  REASON.  It was so distinctly the best thing that could have happened  to me.  If I had been Daddy, and you had been Judy, I should have said,  'Bless you my child, run along and have a good time; see lots of new  people and learn lots of new things; live out of doors, and get strong  and well and rested for a year of hard work.'    But not at all!  Just a curt line from your secretary ordering me to  Lock Willow.    It's the impersonality of your commands that hurts my feelings.  It  seems as though, if you felt the tiniest little bit for me the way I  feel for you, you'd sometimes send me a message that you'd written with  your own hand, instead of those beastly typewritten secretary's notes.  If there were the slightest hint that you cared, I'd do anything on  earth to please you.    I know that I was to write nice, long, detailed letters without ever  expecting any answer.  You're living up to your side of the  bargain--I'm being educated--and I suppose you're thinking I'm not  living up to mine!    But, Daddy, it is a hard bargain.  It is, really.  I'm so awfully  lonely.  You are the only person I have to care for, and you are so  shadowy.  You're just an imaginary man that I've made up--and probably  the real YOU isn't a bit like my imaginary YOU.  But you did once, when  I was ill in the infirmary, send me a message, and now, when I am  feeling awfully forgotten, I get out your card and read it over.    I don't think I am telling you at all what I started to say, which was  this:    Although my feelings are still hurt, for it is very humiliating to be "]]]
