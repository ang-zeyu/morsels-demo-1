Harry, in his impatience, thought the morning would never be over. He  played such pranks--buffeting Frisk, cutting the curls off of Annie's  doll, and finally breaking his grandmother's spectacles--that before his  visitors arrived, indeed, almost immediately after dinner, he contrived to  be sent to bed in disgrace.    10. Poor Harry! there he lay, rolling and kicking, while Jane, and  William, and Annie were busy about the fine, mellow Windsor pears. William  was up in the tree, gathering and shaking; Annie and Jane catching them in  their aprons, and picking them up from the ground; now piling them in  baskets, and now eating the nicest and ripest; while Frisk was barking  gayly among them, as if he were catching Windsor pears, too!    11. Poor Harry! He could hear all this glee and merriment through the open  window as he lay in bed. The storm of passion having subsided, there he  lay weeping and disconsolate, a grievous sob bursting forth every now and  then, as he heard the loud peals of childish laughter, and as he thought  how he should have laughed, and how happy he should have been, had he not  forfeited all this pleasure by his own bad conduct.    12. He wondered if Annie would not be so good-natured as to bring him a  pear. All on a sudden, he heard a little foot on the stair, pitapat, and  he thought she was coming. Pitapat came the foot, nearer and nearer, and  at last a small head peeped, half afraid, through the half-open door.    13. But it was not Annie's head; it was Frisk's--poor Frisk, whom Harry  had been teasing and tormenting all the morning, and who came into the  room wagging his tail, with a great pear in his mouth; and, jumping upon  the bed, He laid it in the little boy's hand.    14. Is not Frisk a fine, grateful fellow? and does he not deserve a share  of Harry's breakfast, whether he begs for it or not? And little Harry will  remember from the events of this day that kindness, even though shown to a  dog, will always be rewarded; and that ill nature and bad temper are  connected with nothing but pain and disgrace.

(83)  By Sarah Roberts.    1. Here  I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;         By the dusty roadside,         On the sunny hillside,         Close by the noisy brook,         In every shady nook,     I come creeping, creeping, everywhere.    2. Here I come, creeping, creeping everywhere;         All round the open door,         Where sit the aged poor,         Here where the children play,         In the bright and merry May,     I come creeping, creeping, everywhere.    3. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;         You can not see me coming,         Nor hear my low, sweet humming,         For in the starry night,         And the glad morning light,     I come, quietly creeping, everywhere.    4. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;         More welcome than the flowers,         In summer's pleasant hours;         The gentle cow is glad,         And the merry birds not sad,     To see me creeping, creeping, everywhere.    5. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;         When you're numbered with the dead,         In your still and narrow bed,         In the happy spring I'll come,         And deck your narrow home,     Creeping, silently creeping, everywhere.    6. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;         My humble song of praise,         Most gratefully I raise,         To Him at whose command         I beautify the land,     Creeping, silently creeping, everywhere.        XXIX. THE EAGLE. (84)    1. The eagle seems to enjoy a kind of supremacy over the rest of the  inhabitants of the air. Such is the loftiness of his flight, that he often  soars in the sky beyond the reach of the naked eye, and such is his  strength that he has been known to carry away children in his talons. But  many of the noble qualities imputed to him are rather fanciful than true.    2. He has been described as showing a lofty independence, which makes him  disdain to feed on anything that is not slain by his own strength. But  Alexander Wilson, the great naturalist, says that he has seen an eagle  feasting on the carcass of a horse. The eagle lives to a great age. One at  Vienna is stated to have died after a confinement of one hundred and four  years.    3. There are several species of the eagle. The golden eagle, which is one  of the largest, is nearly four feet from the point of the beak to the end  of the tail. He is found in most parts of Europe, and is also met with in  America. High rocks and ruined and lonely towers are the places which he  chooses for his abode. His nest is composed of sticks and rushes. The tail  feathers are highly valued as ornaments by the American Indians.    4. The most interesting species is the bald eagle, as this is an American  bird, and the adopted emblem of our country. He lives chiefly upon fish,  and is found in the neighborhood of the sea, and along the shores and  cliffs of our large lakes and rivers.    5. According to the description given by Wilson, he depends, in procuring  his food, chiefly upon the labors of others. He watches the fish hawk as  he dives into the sea for his prey, and darting down upon him as he rises,  forces him to relinquish his victim, and then seizes it before it again  reaches the water.    6. One of the most notable species is the harpy eagle. This is said to be  bold and strong, and to attack beasts, and even man himself. He is fierce,  quarrelsome, and sullen, living alone in the deepest forests. He is found  chiefly in South America.        XXX. THE OLD EAGLE TREE. (86)    1. In a distant field, stood a large tulip tree, apparently of a century's  growth, and one of the most gigantic. It looked like the father of the  surrounding forest. A single tree of huge dimensions, standing all alone,  is a sublime object.    2. On the top of this tree, an old eagle, commonly called the \"Fishing  Eagle,\" had built her nest every year, for many years, and, undisturbed,  had raised her young. A remarkable place to choose, as she procured her  food from the ocean, and this tree stood full ten miles from the seashore.  It had long been known as the \"Old Eagle Tree.\"    3. On a warm, sunny day, the workmen were hoeing corn in an adjoining  field. At a certain hour of the day, the old eagle was known to set off  for the seaside, to gather food for her young. As she this day returned  with a large fish in her claws, the workmen surrounded the tree, and, by  yelling and hooting, and throwing stones, so scared the poor bird that she  dropped her fish, and they carried it off in triumph.    4. The men soon dispersed, but Joseph sat down under a hush near by, to  watch, and to bestow unavailing pity. The bird soon returned to her nest,  without food. The eaglets at once set up a cry for food, so shrill, so  clear, and so clamorous that the boy was greatly moved.    5. The parent bird seemed to try to soothe them; but their appetites were  too keen, and it was all in vain. She then perched herself on a limb near  them, and looked down into the nest in a manner that seemed to say, \"I  know not what to do next.\"    6. Her indecision was but momentary; again she poised herself, uttered one  or two sharp notes, as if telling them to a \"lie still,\" balanced her  body, spread her wings, and was away again for the sea.    7. Joseph was determined to see the result. His eye followed her till she  grew small, smaller, a mere speck in the sky, and then disappeared. What  boy has not thus watched the flight of the bird of his country!    8. She was gone nearly two hours, about double her usual time for a  voyage, when she again returned, on a slow, weary wing, flying uncommonly  low, in order to have a heavier atmosphere to sustain her, with another  fish in her talons.    9. On nearing the field, she made a circuit round it, to see if her  enemies were again there. Finding the coast clear, she once more reached  the tree, drooping, faint, and weary, and evidently nearly exhausted.  Again the eaglets set up their cry, which was soon hushed by the  distribution of a dinner, such as, save the cooking, a king might admire.    10. \"Glorious bird!\" cried the boy, \"what a spirit!\" Other birds can fly  more swiftly, others can sing more sweetly, others scream more loudly; but  what other bird, when persecuted and robbed, when weary, when discouraged,  when so far from the sea, would do this?    11. \"Glorious bird! I will learn a lesson from thee to-day. I will never  forget, hereafter, that when the spirit is determined it can do almost  anything. Others would have drooped, and hung the head, and mourned over  the cruelty of man, and sighed over the wants of the nestlings; but thou,  by at once recovering the loss, hast forgotten all.\"    12. \"I will learn of thee, noble bird! I will remember this. I will set my  mark high. I will try to do something, and to be something in the world; I  will never yield to discouragements.\"      DEFINITIONS.--l.

Can  she be Miss Violet's own mother? There is a resemblance, though their  styles of beauty are quite different, but there does not seem to be  sufficient difference in age.\"    \"She _is_ own mother, though, and not only to Violet, but to two older  ones--a son and daughter.\"    The captain expressed great surprise. \"But youthful looks must be a family  characteristic,\" he added meditatively. \"Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore look  extremely young to be the grandparents of the family.\"    Donald explained that Mr. Dinsmore was really only eighteen years older  than his daughter, and Rose, a second wife, but half as many.    \"And what think you of Violet's beauty?\" he asked.    \"Absolutely faultless! She has an angelic face! If I were a young fellow  like you, Keith, I'd certainly not look elsewhere while I could see a ray  of hope in that direction. But there's the relationship in the way.\"    \"It's too distant to stand in the way,\" returned Donald a trifle shortly,  \"I look upon her prospective wealth as a far greater obstacle, having no  fancy for playing the role of fortune-hunter, or laying myself open to the  suspicion of being such.\"    \"Then you've no intention of trying for her?\"    \"I haven't said so, have I? Well, good-night, it's getting late.\"    \"What do you think of Captain Raymond?\" Rose was asking her husband. \"You  have had by far the best opportunity to cultivate his acquaintance.\"    \"He impresses me very favorably as both a man and a Christian,\" was the  emphatic reply.    \"Ah! I am glad Donald has so nice a friend,\" was her pleased comment.    \"Yes, there seems a warm friendship existing between them, though the  captain must be the older by several years. Married too, for he mentioned  his children incidentally.\"    On coming down to the parlor the next morning the guests found Mr.  Dinsmore there fondling his little grandchildren--Rosie on one knee,  Walter on the other.    Cousin Donald's entrance was hailed with delight, Walter presently  transferred to his knee.    Then the captain coaxed Rosie to his, saying, \"Your dark eyes and hair  remind me of my little Lulu's.\"    \"Have you a little girl of your own, sir?\" Rosie asked with a look of  interest.    \"Yes, my dear, two of them. Lulu is a year or two younger than I take you  to be, and Gracie is only seven.\"    \"Have you any boys?\" inquired Walter.    \"Yes, my little man; I have one. We call him Max. He is two years older  than Lulu.\"    \"About as old as I am?\" said Rosie half inquiringly.    \"Yes; if you are eleven, as I suppose.\"    \"Yes, sir, I'm eleven and Walter's five.\"    \"If they're good children we'd like 'em to come here and play with us,\"  remarked Walter.    \"I am afraid they are not always good,\" the captain said with a smile and  a half sigh. \"I am not with them enough to give them the teaching and  training that doubtless you enjoy.\"    \"But why doesn't their mamma do it? Our mamma teaches us;\" and the child's  eyes turned lovingly upon her as at that moment she entered the room.    The usual morning greetings were exchanged, and Walter's question remained  unanswered.    The gentlemen were out nearly all day, riding or driving; the ladies with  them a part of the time. The evening was enlivened with music and  conversation, and all retired to rest at a seasonable hour; the two guests  expecting to take leave of their hospitable entertainers the next morning.    Darkness and silence reigned for some hours, then the shining of a bright  light into Donald's eyes awoke him.    He sprang from his bed, rushed to the window, saw that a cottage not far  away, which he had noticed in riding by, was in flames. The next moment he  had snatched up a few articles of clothing and was at the captain's side  shaking him vigorously.    \"Up, Raymond! up, man! There's a fire and we'll be needed to help put it  out.\"    \"What is it? breakers ahead, do you say?'\" muttered the captain, only half  awake.    \"Fire! fire!\" repeated Keith.    \"Fire? where?\" and the captain sprang up, now wide awake, and began  hurrying on his clothes.    \"That cottage down the road.\"    \"That's bad indeed; but not quite so bad as a vessel foundering or burning  at sea. Anybody else in the house awake?\"    \"I don't know. Yes, there! I hear steps and voices.\"    They hurried into the hall and down the stairs. Mr. Dinsmore was in the  lower hall giving directions to the men-servants, who were all collected  there.    \"Haste! Solon, Tom, Dick--all of you!\" he was saying, \"gather up all the  large buckets about the house, ropes too and ladders, and follow me as  fast as you can. Ah, captain! and Donald too! You have seen the fire, I  suppose? Will you come with me? There'll be work enough for us all no  doubt. We've no engine in this neighborhood.\"    \"Certainly, sir!\"    \"That's the port we are bound for.\" And each catching up a bucket they all  three set off at full speed in the direction of the burning house, several  of the negroes following close at their heels.    They found a crowd already gathered there--men and women, black and white.  Some were carrying out furniture from the lower rooms, some bringing  water in buckets from a spring near by, others contenting themselves with  looking on and giving orders which nobody obeyed.    \"I see the house will have to go,\" Mr. Dinsmore said. \"Are the family all  out of it?\"    \"All but an old colored woman,\" some one replied, \"old Aunt Betsy. Nobody  thought of her in time, and now it's too late, for the stairs are burned  away. Hark!\" as a crash was heard, \"there's the last of them.\"    \"What! will you leave a helpless old woman to be burnt alive?\" cried  Captain Raymond. \"Where is she?\"    \"Yonder!\" cried several voices; \"see, she's at the window! and she's  screaming for help!\" as a wild shriek rent the air, a black face full of  terror and despair showing itself at an upper window, where the fire's  lurid light fell full upon it.    \"Oh, ain't dar nobody to help ole Aunt Betsy?\" she screamed, stretching  out her wrinkled arms and toil-worn hands in passionate entreaty; \"will  you ebery one ob you leave de po' ole woman to burn up in dis awful fiah?  Isn't ye got no pity in yo' souls! Oh, somebody come an' help de po' ole  woman to git down 'fore she burn all up!\"    \"A rope!\" shouted the captain, \"quick! quick! a rope!\"    \"Heah, massa cap'n!\" answered Solon close it hand. \"Ise brung it jus' in  time.\"    \"What can you do with a rope, Raymond?\" asked Donald.    \"Make an effort to save her with the help of that lightning-rod.\"    \"You risk your own life, and it is worth far more than hers,\" Donald said  entreatingly.    \"Stay a moment, captain,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, \"they are bringing a ladder.\"    \"But there's no time to lose; see! the flames are already bursting out  from the next window.\"    \"Yes, but here it is,\" as the negroes halted with it close beside them.  \"It is to be used to reach that window, boys,\" he said, turning to them  and pointing upward. \"Set it up there.\"    \"Can't do it, sah! 'Mos' as much as a man's life is wuth to go so near de  fire.\"    \"Then give it to me!\" cried the captain, taking hold of it, Mr. Dinsmore  and Donald giving their assistance.    It was the work of a moment to set it up against the wall; in another the  captain was ascending it, while the other two held it firmly in place.    He gained the window and sprang in.    \"Bress you, massa! bress you!\" exclaimed the old negress, \"you's gwine to  save me I knows.\"    \"Get out here on to the ladder and climb down as fast as you can,\" he said  hurriedly, taking hold of her arm to help her.    But she drew back shuddering. \"I can't, massa! I'se ole and stiff. I can't  no how 'tall.\"    There was not a moment to lose. The captain stepped back on to the top  round of the ladder, took her in his arms, and began as rapid a descent as  was possible so burdened.    The ladder shook beneath their weight, for both were heavy, and Aunt Betsy  struggled in his grasp, screaming with fright; then a tongue of flame  shooting out from below caught her cotton gown, and in her frantic terror  she gave a sudden spring that threw her preserver and herself to the  ground.    Mr. Dinsmore and Donald seized the captain and dragged him out of harm's  Way, other hands doing a like service for the woman.    She was shrieking and groaning, but her rescuer neither spoke nor moved.    They took him up, carried him out of the crowd, and laid him gently down  upon a sofa; one of the articles of furniture saved from the fire.    \"Poor fellow!\" sighed Donald with emotion. \"I'm afraid he has paid dear  for his kindness of heart!\"    \"Solon,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, \"mount the fastest horse here and ride to  Roselands for Dr. Arthur. Tell him we don't know how seriously this  gentleman is hurt. Hurry! make all possible haste!\"    Solon was turning to obey, but stopped, exclaiming, \"Why, sho' anuff,  dar's de doctah hisself just lightin' off his hoss ober yondah!\"    \"Then run and bring him here.\"    Arthur obeyed the summons with all speed. The alarm of the fire had  reached Roselands, and he had hastened to the spot to give aid in  extinguishing it, or to any who might be injured.    He found the captain showing signs of life; he moved his head, then opened  his eyes.    \"Where are you hurt, sir?\" asked the doctor.    \"Not very seriously anywhere, I trust,\" replied the captain, trying to  rise. \"Ah!\" as he fell back again, \"both back and ankle seem to have had a  wrench. But, friends, are you not needed over there at the fire? My  injuries can wait.\"    \"Little or nothing more can be done there, and there are people enough on  the ground now to leave us free"]]]
