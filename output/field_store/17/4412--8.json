Well is it with them who judge His Cause with  fairness, and woe betide the unjust.    Every man of insight will, in this day, readily admit that the counsels  which the Pen of this Wronged One hath revealed constitute the supreme  animating power for the advancement of the world and the exaltation of its  peoples. Arise, O people, and, by the power of God's might, resolve to  gain the victory over your own selves, that haply the whole earth may be  freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of its idle  fancies--gods that have inflicted such loss upon, and are responsible for  the misery of their wretched worshippers. These idols form the obstacle  that impedeth man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection. We  cherish the hope that the Hand of divine power may lend its assistance to  mankind and deliver it from its state of grievous abasement.    In one of the Tablets these words have been revealed: O people of God! Do  not busy yourselves in your own concerns; let your thoughts be fixed upon  that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the  hearts and souls of men. This can best be achieved through pure and holy  deeds, through a virtuous life and a goodly behaviour. Valiant acts will  ensure the triumph of this Cause, and a saintly character will reinforce  its power. Cleave unto righteousness, O people of Baha! This, verily, is  the commandment which this Wronged One hath given unto you, and the first  choice of His unrestrained Will for every one of you.    O friends! It behoveth you to refresh and revive your souls through the  gracious favours which in this Divine, this soul-stirring Springtime are  being showered upon you. The Day-Star of His great glory hath shed its  radiance upon you, and the clouds of His limitless grace have overshadowed  you. How high the reward of him that hath not deprived himself of so great  a bounty, nor failed to recognize the beauty of his Best-Beloved in this,  His new attire. Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait,  ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led  by the light of the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from the  darkness that surroundeth you. Let your vision be world-embracing, rather  than confined to your own self. The Evil One is he that hindereth the rise  and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the children of men.    It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold fast unto whatsoever  will promote the interests, and exalt the station, of all nations and just  governments. Through each and every one of the verses which the Pen of the  Most High hath revealed, the doors of love and unity have been unlocked  and flung open to the face of men. We have erewhile declared--and Our Word  is the truth--: 'Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of  friendliness and fellowship.' Whatsoever hath led the children of men to  shun one another, and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them,  hath, through the revelation of these words, been nullified and abolished.  From the heaven of God's Will, and for the purpose of ennobling the world  of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men, hath been sent down  that which is the most effective instrument for the education of the whole  human race. The highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever  the peoples of old have either said or written hath, through this most  potent Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the  All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding God. Of old it hath been revealed: 'Love  of one's country is an element of the Faith of God.' The Tongue of  Grandeur hath, however, in the day of His manifestation proclaimed: 'It is  not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his who loveth the  world.' Through the power released by these exalted words He hath lent a  fresh impulse and set a new direction to the birds of men's hearts, and  hath obliterated every trace of restriction and limitation from God's holy  Book.    This Wronged One hath forbidden the people of God to engage in contention  or conflict and hath exhorted them to righteous deeds and praiseworthy  character. In this day the hosts that can ensure the victory of the Cause  are those of goodly conduct and saintly character. Blessed are they who  firmly adhere unto them and woe betide such as turn away therefrom.    O people of God! I admonish you to observe courtesy, for above all else it  is the prince of virtues. Well is it with him who is illumined with the  light of courtesy and is attired with the vesture of uprightness. Whoso is  endued with courtesy hath indeed attained a sublime station. It is hoped  that this Wronged One and everyone else may be enabled to acquire it, hold  fast unto it, observe it, and fix our gaze upon it. This is a binding  command which hath streamed forth from the Pen of the Most Great Name.    This is the day when the gems of constancy that lie hid in the mine of  men's inner selves should be made manifest. O people of Justice! Be as  brilliant as the light and as splendid as the fire that blazed in the  Burning Bush. The brightness of the fire of your love will no doubt fuse  and unify the contending peoples and kindreds of the earth, whilst the  fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot but result in strife  and ruin. We beseech God that He may shield His creatures from the evil  designs of His enemies. He verily hath power over all things.    All praise be to the one true God--exalted be His glory--inasmuch as He  hath, through the Pen of the Most High, unlocked the doors of men's  hearts. Every verse which this Pen hath revealed is a bright and shining  portal that discloseth the glories of a saintly and pious life, of pure  and stainless deeds. The summons and the message which We gave were never  intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind in  its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and  vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto true liberty.  The whole earth is illuminated with the resplendent glory of God's  Revelation. In the year sixty He Who heralded the light of Divine  Guidance--may all creation be a sacrifice unto Him--arose to announce a  fresh revelation of the Divine Spirit, and was followed, twenty years  later, by Him through Whose coming the world was made the recipient of  this promised glory, this wondrous favour. Behold how the generality of  mankind hath been endued with the capacity to hearken unto God's most  exalted Word--the Word upon which must depend the gathering together and  spiritual resurrection of all men.    Whilst in the Prison of Akka, We revealed in the Crimson Book that which  is conducive to the advancement of mankind and to the reconstruction of  the world. The utterances set forth therein by the Pen of the Lord of  creation include the following which constitute the fundamental principles  for the administration of the affairs of men:    First: It is incumbent upon the ministers of the House of Justice to  promote the Lesser Peace so that the people of the earth may be relieved  from the burden of exorbitant expenditures. This matter is imperative and  absolutely essential, inasmuch as hostilities and conflict lie at the root  of affliction and calamity.    Second: Languages must be reduced to one common language to be taught in  all the schools of the world.    Third: It behoveth man to adhere tenaciously unto that which will promote  fellowship, kindliness and unity.    Fourth: Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a trusted  person a portion of what he or she earneth through trade, agriculture or  other occupation, for the training and education of children, to be spent  for this purpose with the knowledge of the Trustees of the House of  Justice.    Fifth: Special regard must be paid to agriculture. Although it hath been  mentioned in the fifth place, unquestionably it precedeth the others.  Agriculture is highly developed in foreign lands, however in Persia it  hath so far been grievously neglected. It is hoped that His Majesty the  Shah--may God assist him by His grace--will turn his attention to this vital  and important matter.    Were men to strictly observe that which the Pen of the Most High hath  revealed in the Crimson Book, they could then well afford to dispense with  the regulations which prevail in the world. Certain exhortations have  repeatedly streamed forth from the Pen of the Most High that perchance the  manifestations of power and the dawning-places of might may, sometime, be  enabled to enforce them. Indeed, were sincere seekers to be found, every  emanation of God's pervasive and irresistible Will would, for the sake of  His love, be revealed. But where are to be found earnest seekers and  inquiring minds? Whither are gone the equitable and the fair-minded? At  present no day passeth without the fire of a fresh tyranny blazing  fiercely, or the sword of a new aggression being unsheathed. Gracious God!  The great and the noble in Persia glory in acts of such savagery that one  is lost in amazement at the tales thereof.    Day and night this Wronged One yieldeth thanks and praise unto the Lord of  men, for it is witnessed that the words of counsel and exhortation We  uttered have proved effective and that this people hath evinced such  character and conduct as are acceptable in Our sight. This is affirmed by  virtue of the event which hath truly cheered the eye of the world, and is  none other than the intercession of the friends with the high authorities  in favour of their enemies. Indeed one's righteous deeds testify to the  truth of one's words. We cherish the hope that men of piety may illumine  the world through the radiant light of their conduct, and We entreat the  Almighty--glorified and exalted is He--to grant that everyone may in this  Day remain steadfast in His "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314"],[0,"Five Children and It (#12)"],[1,"chosen by the Lamb to get under  the table and break his squeaking bird. There was a sharp convenient  wire inside the bird, and of course the Lamb ran the wire into Robert's  leg at once; and so, without anyone's meaning to do it the secret drawer  was flooded with ink. At the same time a stream was poured over Anthea's  half-finished letter.    So that her letter was something like this--              \"DARLING MOTHER,--I hope you are quite well, and I            hope Granny is better. The other day we....\"    Then came a flood of ink, and at the bottom these words in pencil--              \"It was not me upset the ink, but it took such a            time clearing up, so no more as it is            post-time.--From your loving daughter     \"ANTHEA.\"    Robert's letter had not even been begun. He had been drawing a ship on  the blotting paper while he was trying to think of what to say. And of  course after the ink was upset he had to help Anthea to clean out her  desk, and he promised to make her another secret drawer, better than  the other. And she said, \"Well, make it now.\" So it was post-time and  his letter wasn't done. And the secret drawer wasn't done either.    Cyril wrote a long letter, very fast, and then went to set a trap for  slugs that he had read about in the _Home-made Gardener_, and when it  was post-time the letter could not be found, and it was never found.  Perhaps the slugs ate it.    Jane's letter was the only one that went. She meant to tell her mother  all about the Psammead,--in fact they had all meant to do this,--but she  spent so long thinking how to spell the word that there was no time to  tell the story properly, and it is useless to tell a story unless you  _do_ tell it properly, so she had to be contented with this--              \"MY DEAR MOTHER DEAR,--We are all as good as we            can, like you told us to, and the Lamb has a            little cold, but Martha says it is nothing, only            he upset the gold-fish into himself yesterday            morning. When we were up at the sand-pit the other            day we went round by the safe way where carts go,            and we found  a\"--    Half an hour went by before Jane felt quite sure that they could none of  them spell Psammead. And they could not find it in the dictionary  either, though they looked. Then Jane hastily finished her letter--              \"We found a strange thing, but it is nearly            post-time, so no more at present from your little            girl,                                                       \"JANE.              \"P.S.--If you could have a wish come true what            would you have?\"    Then the postman was heard blowing his horn, and Robert rushed out in  the rain to stop his cart and give him the letters. And that was how it  happened that, though all the children meant to tell their mother about  the Sand-fairy, somehow or other she never got to know. There were other  reasons why she never got to know, but these come later.    The next day Uncle Richard came and took them all to Maidstone in a  wagonette--all except the Lamb. Uncle Richard was the very best kind of  uncle. He bought them toys at Maidstone. He took them into a shop and  let them all choose exactly what they wanted, without any restrictions  about price, and no nonsense about things being instructive. It is very  wise to let children choose exactly what they like, because they are  very foolish and inexperienced, and sometimes they will choose a really  instructive thing without meaning to do so. This happened to Robert, who  chose, at the last moment, and in a great hurry, a box with pictures on  it of winged bulls with men's heads and winged men with eagles' heads.  He thought there would be animals inside, the same as on the box. When  he got it home it was a Sunday puzzle about ancient Nineveh! The others  chose in haste, and were happy at leisure. Cyril had a model engine, and  the girls had two dolls, as well as a china tea-set with forget-me-nots  on it, to be \"between them.\" The boys' \"between them\" was bow and arrow.    Then Uncle Richard took them on the beautiful Medway in a boat, and then  they all had tea at a beautiful confectioner's and when they reached  home it was far too late to have any wishes that day.    They did not tell Uncle Richard anything about the Psammead. I do not  know why. And they do not know why. But I daresay you can guess.    The day after Uncle Richard had behaved so handsomely was a very hot day  indeed. The people who decide what the weather is to be, and put its  orders down for it in the newspapers every morning, said afterwards that  it was the hottest day there had been for years. They had ordered it to  be \"warmer--some showers,\" and warmer it certainly was. In fact it was  so busy being warmer that it had no time to attend to the order about  showers, so there weren't any.    Have you ever been up at five o'clock on a fine summer morning? It is  very beautiful. The sunlight is pinky and yellowy, and all the grass and  trees are covered with dew-diamonds. And all the shadows go the opposite  way to the way they do in the evening, which is very interesting and  makes you feel as though you were in a new other world.    Anthea woke at five. She had made herself wake, and I must tell you how  it is done, even if it keeps you waiting for the story to go on.    You get into bed at night, and lie down quite flat on your little back,  with your hands straight down by your sides. Then you say \"I _must_ wake  up at five\" (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or whatever the time  is that you want), and as you say it you push your chin down on your  chest and then whack your head back on the pillow. And you do this as  many times as there are ones in the time you want to wake up at. (It is  quite an easy sum.) Of course everything depends on your really wanting  to get up at five (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine); if you don't  really want to, it's all of no use. But if you do--well, try it and see.  Of course in this, as in doing Latin proses or getting into mischief,  practice makes perfect.    Anthea was quite perfect.    At the very moment when she opened her eyes she heard the black-and-gold  clock down in the dining-room strike eleven. So she knew it was three  minutes to five. The black-and-gold clock always struck wrong, but it  was all right when you knew what it meant. It was like a person talking  a foreign language. If you know the language it is just as easy to  understand as English. And Anthea knew the clock language. She was very  sleepy, but she jumped out of bed and put her face and hands into a  basin of cold water. This is a fairy charm that prevents your wanting to  get back into bed again. Then she dressed, and folded up her night  dress. She did not tumble it together by the sleeves, but folded it by  the seams from the hem, and that will show you the kind of  well-brought-up little girl she was.    Then she took her shoes in her hand and crept softly down the stairs.  She opened the dining-room window and climbed out. It would have been  just as easy to go out by the door, but the window was more romantic,  and less likely to be noticed by Martha.    \"I will always get up at five,\" she said to herself. \"It was quite too  awfully pretty for anything.\"    Her heart was beating very fast, for she was carrying out a plan quite  her own. She could not be sure that it was a good plan, but she was  quite sure that it would not be any better if she were to tell the  others about it. And she had a feeling that, right or wrong, she would  rather go through with it alone. She put on her shoes under the iron  verandah, on the red-and-yellow shining tiles, and then she ran straight  to the sand-pit, and found the Psammead's place, and dug it out; it was  very cross indeed.    \"It's too bad,\" it said, fluffing up its fur as pigeons do their  feathers at Christmas time. \"The weather's arctic, and it's the middle  of the night.\"    \"I'm so sorry,\" said Anthea gently, and she took off her white pinafore  and covered the Sand-fairy up with it, all but its head, its bat's ears,  and its eyes that were like a snail's eyes.    \"Thank you,\" it said, \"that's better. What's the wish this morning?\"    \"I don't know,\" she said; \"that's just it. You see we've been very  unlucky, so far. I wanted to talk to you about it. But--would you mind  not giving me any wishes till after breakfast? It's so hard to talk to  anyone if they jump out at you with wishes you don't really want!\"    \"You shouldn't say you wish for things if you don't wish for them. In  the old days people almost always knew whether it was Megatherium or  Ichthyosaurus they really wanted for dinner.\"    \"I'll try not to do so,\" said Anthea, \"but I do wish\"--    \"Look out!\" said the Psammead in a warning voice, and it began to blow  itself out.    \"Oh, this isn't a magic wish--it's just--I should be so glad if you'd  not swell yourself out and nearly burst to give me anything just now.  Wait till the others are here.\"    \"Well, well,\" it said indulgently, but it shivered.    \"Would you,\" asked Anthea kindly--\"would you like to come and sit on my  lap? You'd be warmer, and I could turn the skirt of my frock up around  you. I'd be very careful.\"    Anthea had never expected that it would, but it did.    \"Thank you,\" it said; \"you really are rather thoughtful.\" It crept on to  her lap and snuggled down, and she put her arms round it with a rather  frightened gentleness. \"Now then!\" it said.    \"Well then,\" said Anthea, \"everything we have wished has turned out  rather horrid. I wish you would advise us. You are so old, you must be  very wise.\"    \"I was always generous from a child,\" said the Sand-fairy. \"I've spent  the whole of my waking hours in giving. But one thing I won't  give--that's advice.\"    \"You see,\" Anthea went on, \"it's such a wonderful thing--such a  splendid, glorious chance. It's so good and"]]]
