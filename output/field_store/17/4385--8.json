And  first of all he consider'd the _Water_, which he found, if let alone in  that Condition which its Form requir'd, had these two things in it,  _viz_. Sensible Cold, and a Propension to move downwards; But if heated  by the Fire or the Sun, its Coldness was remov'd, but its Propension to  move downwards still remain'd: But afterwards, when it came to be more  vehemently heated, it lost its tendency downwards, and mounted upwards;  and so it was wholly depriv'd of both those Properties which us'd  constantly to proceed from it, and from its Form: Nor did he know any  thing more of its Form, but only that these two Actions proceeded from  thence; and when these two ceas'd, the Nature of the Form was alter'd,  and the watry Form was remov'd from that Body, since there appear'd in  it Actions, which must needs owe their Origin to another Form. Therefore  it must have receiv'd another Form which had not been there before,from  which arose those Actions, which never us'd to appear in it whilst it  had the other Form.    Sec. 49. Now he knew that every thing that was produc'd anew, must needs  have some Producer. And from this Contemplation, there arose in his Mind  a sort of Impression of the Maker of that Form, tho' his Notion of him  as yet was general and indistinct. Then he paus'd on the examining of  these Forms which he knew before, one by one, and found that they were  produc'd anew, and that they must of necessity be beholden to some  efficient Cause. Then he consider'd the Essences of Forms, and found  that they were nothing else, but only a Disposition of _Body_ to produce  such or such Actions. For instance, Water, when very much heated, is  dispos'd to rise upwards, and that Disposition is its Form. For there is  nothing present in this Motion, but _Body_, and some things which are  observ'd to arise from it, which were not in it before (such as  Qualities and Motions) and the Efficients which produce them. Now the  fitness of Body for one Motion rather than another, is its _Disposition_  and _Form_. The same he concluded of all other Forms, and it appear'd to  him, that those Actions which arose from them, were not in reality owing  to them, but to the efficient Cause, who made use of these Forms to  produce those Actions which are attributed to them, [_i.e_, the Forms].  Which Notion of his is exactly the same with what God's Apostle  [_Mahomet_] says; _I am his Hearing by which he hears, and his Seeing by  which he sees._ And in the _Alcoran; You did not kill them, but God  kill'd them; when thou threwest the Darts, it was not thou that threwest  them, but God_.    Sec. 50. Now, when he had attain'd thus far, so as to have a general and  indistinct Motion of this _Agent_, he had a most earnest Desire to know  him distinctly. And because he had not as yet withdrawn himself from the  sensible World, he began to look for this _voluntary Agent_ among  sensible Things; nor did he as yet know, whether it was one Agent or  many. Therefore he enquir'd strictly into all such Bodies as he had  about him, _viz_. those which he had been employ'd about all along, and  he found that they were all liable to _Generation_ and _Corruption_: And  if there were any which did not suffer a total Corruption, yet they were  liable to a partial one, as _Water_ and _Earth_, the parts of which are  consum'd by Fire. Likewise he perceiv'd, that the _Air_ was by extremity  of Cold chang'd into Snow, and then again into Water; and among all the  rest of the Bodies which he was conversant with, he could find none  which had not its Existence anew, and required some _voluntary Agent_ to  give it a Being. Upon which account he laid them all aside, and  transferr'd his Thoughts to the Consideration of the Heavenly Bodies.  And thus far he reach'd in his Contemplations, about the end of the  fourth Septenary of his Age, _viz_. when he now eight and twenty Years  old.    Sec. 51. Now he knew very well, that the Heavens, and all the Luminaries in  them, were Bodies, because they were all extended according to the three  Dimensions Length, Breadth and Thickness, without any exception; and  that every thing that was so extended, was Body; _ergo_, they were all  Bodies. Then, he consider'd next, whether they were extended infinitely,  as to stretch themselves to an endless Length, Breadth and Thickness;  or, whether they were circumscrib'd by any Limits, and terminated by  some certain Bounds, beyond which there could be no Extension. But here  he stopp'd a while, as in a kind of Amazement.    Sec. 52. At last, by the strength of his Apprehension, and Sagacity of his  Understanding, he perceiv'd that the Notion of infinite Body was absurd  and impossible, and a Notion wholly intelligible. He confirm'd himself  in this Judgment of his, by a great many Arguments which occurr'd to  him, when he thus argued with himself. _That this heavenly Body is  terminated on this side which is next to me, is evident to my sight: And  that it cannot be infinitely extended on that opposite side, which  rais'd this Scruple in me; I prove thus: Suppose two Lines drawn from  the Extremity of this Heavenly Body, on that terminated Side which is  next to me, which Lines should be produc'd quite through this Body_, in  infinitum, _according to the Extension of the Body; then suppose a long  part of one of these Lines, cut off at this End which is next to me;  then take the Remainder of what was cut off, and draw down that end of  it where it was cut off; And lay it even with the end of the other Line  from which there was nothing cut off; and let that Line which was  shortned, lye parallel with the other; then suppose them through this  Body, till you come to that side which we suppos'd to be infinite:  Either you will find both these Lines infinitely extended, and then one  of them cannot be shorter than the other, but that which had a part of  it cut off, will be as long as that which was not, which is absurd: Or  else the Line which was cut will not be so long as that other, and  consequently finite: Therefore if you add that part to it which was cut  off from it at first, which was finite, the whole will be finite; and  then it will be no longer or shorter than that Line which had nothing  cut off from it, therefore equal to it; But this is finite, therefore  the other is finite. Therefore the Body in which such Lines are drawn is  finite; And all Bodies in which such Lines may be drawn, are finite: But  such Lines may be drawn in all Bodies. Therefore if we suppose an  infinite Body, we suppose an Absurdity and Impossibility._           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration 6]           *       *       *       *       *    Sec. 52b. When by the singular strength of his Genius, (which he exerted in  the finding out such a Demonstration) he had satisfied himself that the  Body of Heaven was finite; he desired, in the next place, to know what  Figure it was of, and how it was limited by the circumambient  Superficies. And first he observ'd the Sun, Moon and Stars, and saw that  they all rose in the East, and set in the West; and those which went  right over his Head describ'd a great Circle, but those at at greater  distance from the Vertical Point, either Northward or Southward,  describ'd a lesser Circle. So that the least Circles which were  describ'd by any of the Stars, were those two which went round the two  Poles, the one North, the other South; the last of which is the Circle  of _Sohail_ or _Canopus_; the first, the Circle of those two Stars which  are called in _Arabick Alpherkadani_. Now because he liv'd under the  Equinoctial Line, (as we shew'd before) all those Circles did cut the  Horizon at right Angles, and both North and South were alike to him, and  he could see both the Pole-Stars: He observ'd, that if a Star arose at  any time in a great Circle, and another Star at the same in a lesser  Circle, yet nevertheless, as they rose together, so they set together:  and he observ'd it of all the Stars, and at all times. From whence he  concluded, that the Heaven was of a Spherical Figure; in which Opinion  he was confirm'd, by observing the Return of the Sun, Moon and Stars to  the East, after their Setting; and also, because they always appear'd to  him of the same bigness, both when they rose, and when they were in the  midst of Heaven, and at the time of their Setting; whereas, if their  Motions had not been Circular, they must have been nearer to sight, at  some times than others; and consequently their Dimensions would have  appear'd proportionably greater or lesser; but since there was no such  Appearance, he concluded that their Motions were Circular. Then he  consider'd the Motion of the Moon and the Planets from West to East,  till at last he understood a great part of Astronomy. Besides, he  apprehended that their Motions were in different Spheres, all which were  comprehended in another which was above them all, and which turn'd about  all the rest in the space of a Day and a Night. But it were too tedious  to explain particularly how he advanc'd in this Science; besides, 'tis  taught in other Books; and what we have already said, is as much as is  requisite for our present purpose.    Sec. 53. When he had attain'd to this degree of Knowledge, he found that  the whole Orb of the Heavens, and whatsoever was contained in it, was as  one Thing compacted and join'd together; and that all those Bodies which  he us'd to consider before as Earth, Water, Air, Plants, Animals and the  like, were all of them so contain'd in it, as never to go out of its  Bounds: And that the whole was like One Animal, in which the Luminaries  represented the Senses; The Spheres so join'd and compacted together,  answer'd to the Limbs; and the Sublunary World, to the Belly, in which  the Excrements and Humors are contain'd, and which oftentimes breeds  Animals, as the Greater World.

The chronicles contain a record of long  and generally peaceful intercourse with Ceylon, but this though  important for religion and literature had little political effect. The  Chinese occasionally invaded Upper Burma and demanded tribute but the  invasions were brief and led to no permanent occupation. On the west  Arakan was worried by the Viceroys of the Mogul Emperors and on the  east the Burmese frequently invaded Siam. But otherwise from the  beginning of authentic history until the British annexation Burma was  left to itself and had not, like so many Asiatic states, to submit to  foreign conquest and the imposition of foreign institutions. Yet let  it not be supposed that its annals are peaceful and uneventful. The  land supplied its own complications, for of the many races inhabiting  it, three, the Burmese, Talaings and Shans, had rival aspirations and  founded dynasties. Of these three races, the Burmese proper appear to  have come from the north west, for a chain of tribes speaking cognate  languages is said to extend from Burma to Nepal. The Mons or  Talaings are allied linguistically to the Khmers of Camboja. Their  country (sometimes called Ramannadesa) was in Lower Burma and its  principal cities were Pegu and Thaton. The identity of the name  Talaing with Telingana or Kalinga is not admitted by all scholars, but  native tradition connects the foundation of the kingdom with the east  coast of India and it seems certain that such a connection existed in  historical times and kept alive Hinayanist Buddhism which may have  been originally introduced by this route.    The Shan States lie in the east of Burma on the borders of Yunnan and  Laos. Their traditions carry their foundation back to the fourth and  fifth centuries B.C. There is no confirmation of this, but bodies of  Shans, a race allied to the Siamese, may have migrated into this  region at any date, perhaps bringing Buddhism with them or receiving  it direct from China. Recent investigations have shown that there was  also a fourth race, designated as Pyus, who occupied territory between  the Burmese and Talaings in the eleventh century. They will probably  prove of considerable importance for philology and early history,  perhaps even for the history of some phases of Burmese Buddhism, for  the religious terms found in their inscriptions are Sanskrit rather  than Pali and this suggests direct communication with India. But until  more information is available any discussion of this interesting but  mysterious people involves so many hypotheses and arguments of detail  that it is impossible in a work like the present. Prome was one of  their principal cities, their name reappears in P'iao, the old Chinese  designation of Burma, and perhaps also in Pagan, one form of which is  Pugama.[124]    Throughout the historical period the pre-eminence both in individual  kings and dynastic strength rested with the Burmese but their contests  with the Shans and Talaings form an intricate story which can be  related here only in outline. Though the three races are distinct and  still preserve their languages, yet they conquered one another, lived  in each other's capitals and shared the same ambitions so that in more  recent centuries no great change occurred when new dynasties came to  power or territory was redistributed. The long chronicle of  bloodstained but ineffectual quarrels is relieved by the exploits of  three great kings, Anawrata, Bayin Naung and Alompra.    Historically, Arakan may be detached from the other provinces. The  inhabitants represent an early migration from Tagaung and were not  annexed by any kingdom in Burma until 1784 A.D. Tagaung, situated on  the Upper Irrawaddy in the Ruby Mines district, was the oldest capital  of the Burmese and has a scanty history apparently going back to the  early centuries of our era. Much the same may be said of the Talaing  kingdom in Lower Burma. The kings of Tagaung were succeeded by another  dynasty connected with them which reigned at Prome. No dates can be  given for these events, nor is the part which the Pyus played in them  clear, but it is said that the Talaings destroyed the kingdom of  Prome in 742 A.D.[125] According to tradition the centre of power  moved about this time to Pagan[126] on the bank of the Irrawaddy  somewhat south of Mandalay. But the silence of early Chinese  accounts[127] as to Pagan, which is not mentioned before the Sung  dynasty, makes it probable that later writers exaggerated its early  importance and it is only when Anawrata, King of Pagan and the first  great name in Burmese history, ascended the throne that the course of  events becomes clear and coherent. He conquered Thaton in 1057 and  transported many of the inhabitants to his own capital. He also  subdued the nearer Shan states and was master of nearly all Burma as  we understand the term. The chief work of his successors was to  construct the multitude of pagodas which still ornament the site of  Pagan. It would seem that the dynasty gradually degenerated and that  the Shans and Talaings acquired strength at its expense. Its end came  in 1298 and was hastened by the invasion of Khubilai Khan. There then  arose two simultaneous Shan dynasties at Panya and Sagaing which  lasted from 1298 till 1364. They were overthrown by King Thadominpaya  who is believed to have been a Shan. He founded Ava which, whether it  was held by Burmese or Shans, was regarded as the chief city of Burma  until 1752, although throughout this period the kings of Pegu and  other districts were frequently independent. During the fourteenth  century another kingdom grew up at Toungoo[128] in Lower Burma. Its  rulers were originally Shan governors sent from Ava but ultimately  they claimed to be descendants of the last king of Pagan and, in this  character, Bureng or Bayin Naung (1551-1581), the second great ruler  of Burma, conquered Prome, Pegu and Ava. His kingdom began to break up  immediately after his death but his dynasty ruled in Ava until the  middle of the eighteenth century.    During this period Europeans first made their appearance and quarrels  with Portuguese adventurers were added to native dissensions. The  Shans and Talaings became turbulent and after a tumultuous interval  the third great national hero, Alaung-paya or Alompra, came to the  front. In the short space of eight years (1752-1760), he gained  possession of Ava, made the Burmese masters of both the northern and  southern provinces, founded Rangoon and invaded both Manipur and Siam.  While on the latter expedition he died. Some of his successors held  their court at Ava but Bodawpaya built a new capital at Amarapura  (1783) and Mindon Min another at Mandalay (1857). The dynasty came to  an end in 1886 when King Thibaw was deposed by the Government of India  and his dominions annexed.    2      The early history of Buddhism in Burma is obscure, as in most other  countries, and different writers have maintained that it was  introduced from northern India, the east coast of India, Ceylon, China  or Camboja.[129] All these views may be in a measure true, for there  is reason to believe that it was not introduced at one epoch or from  one source or in one form.    It is not remarkable that Indian influence should be strong among the  Burmese. The wonder rather is that they have preserved such strong  individuality in art, institutions and everyday life, that no one can  pass from India into Burma without feeling that he has entered a new  country. This is because the mountains which separate it from Eastern  Bengal and run right down to the sea form a barrier still sufficient  to prevent communication by rail. But from the earliest times  Indian immigrants and Indian ideas have been able to find their way  both by land and sea. According to the Burmese chronicles Tagaung was  founded by the Hindu prince Abhiraja in the ninth century B.C. and the  kingdom of Arakan claims as its first ruler an ancient prince of  Benares. The legends have not much more historical value than the  Kshattriya genealogies which Brahmans have invented for the kings of  Manipur, but they show that the Burmese knew of India and wished to  connect themselves with it. This spirit led not only to the invention  of legends but to the application of Indian names to Burmese  localities. For instance Aparantaka, which really designates a  district of western India, is identified by native scholars with Upper  Burma.[130] The two merchants Tapussa and Bhallika who were the first  to salute the Buddha after his enlightenment are said to have come  from Ukkala. This is usually identified with Orissa but Burmese  tradition locates it in Burma. A system of mythical geography has thus  arisen.    The Buddha himself is supposed to have visited Burma, as well as  Ceylon, in his lifetime[131] and even to have imparted some of his  power to the celebrated"]]]
