The work has been very successful, though not perhaps quite  so completely accomplished as Prof. Petrie himself inclines to believe.  The first identification was made by Prof. Sethe, of Gottingen, who  pointed out that the names Semti and Merpeba on a vase-fragment found  by M. Amelineau were in reality those of the kings Hesepti and Merbap  of the lists, the Ousaphais and Miebis of Manetho. The perfectly certain  identifications are these:--    5. Den Semti = Hesepti, _Ousaphais_, Ist Dynasty.    6. Atjab Merpeba = Merbap, _Miebis_, Ist Dynasty.    7. Semerkha Nekht= Shemsu or Semsem (?), _Semempres_, Ist Dynasty.    8. Qa Sen = Qebh, _Bienehhes_, Ist Dynasty.    9. Khasekhemui Besh = Betju-mer (?), _Boethos_, IId Dynasty.    10. Neneter = Bineneter, _Binothris_, IId Dynasty.      Six of the Abydos kings have thus been identified with names in the  lists and in Manetho; that is to say, we now know the real names of six  of the earliest Egyptian monarchs, whose appellations are given us  under mutilated forms by the later list-makers. Prof. Petrie further  identifies (4) Tja Ati with Ateth, (3) Tjer with Teta, and (1) Aha with  Mena. Mena, Teta, Ateth, Ata, Hesepti, Merbap, Shemsu (?), and Qebh are  the names of the 1st Dynasty as given in the lists. The equivalent of  Ata Prof. Petrie finds in the name \"Merneit,\" which is found at Umm  el-Ga'ab. But there is no proof whatever that Merneit was a king; he  was much more probably a prince or other great personage of the reign  of Den, who was buried with the kings. Prof. Petrie accepts the  identification of the personal name of Aha as \"Men,\" and so makes him  the only equivalent of Mena. But this reading of the name is still  doubtful. Arguing that Aha must be Mena, and having all the rest of the  kings of the Ist Dynasty identified with the names in the lists, Prof.  Petrie is compelled to exclude Narmer from the dynasty, and to relegate  him to \"Dynasty 0,\" before the time of Mena. It is quite possible,  however, that Narmer was the successor, not the predecessor, of Mena.  He was certainly either the one or the other, as the style of art in his  time was exactly the same as that in the time of Aha. The \"Scorpion,\"  too, whose name is found at Hierakonpolis, certainly dates to the same  time as Narmer and Aha, for the style of his work is the same. And it  may well be that he is not to be counted as a separate king, belonging  to \"Dynasty 0 \"(or \"Dynasty -I\") at all, but as identical with Narmer,  just as \"Sma\" may also be. We thus find that the two kings who left the  most developed remains at Hierakonpolis are the two whose monuments at  Abydos are the oldest of all on that site. That is to say, the kings  whose monuments record the conquest of the North belong to the period  of transition from the old Hierakonpolite dominion of Upper Egypt to the  new kingdom of all Egypt. They, in fact, represent the \"Mena\" or Menes  of tradition. It may be that Aha bore the personal name of _Men_, which  would thus be the original of Mena, but this is uncertain. In any case  both Aha and Narmer must be assigned to the Ist Dynasty, with the result  that we know of more kings belonging to the dynasty than appear in the  lists.    Nor is this improbable. Manetho's list is evidently based upon old  Egyptian lists derived from the authorities upon which the king-lists of  Abydos and Sakkara were based. These old lists were made under the  XIXth Dynasty, when an interest in the oldest kings seems to have been  awakened, and the ruling monarchs erected temples at Abydos in their  honour. This phenomenon can only have been due to a discovery of Umm  el-Ga'ab and its treasures, the tombs of which were recognized as  the burial-places (real or secondary) of the kings before the  pyramid-builders. Seti I. and his son Ramses then worshipped the kings  of Umm el-Ga'ab, with their names set before them in the order, number,  and spelling in which the scribes considered they ought to be inscribed.  It is highly probable that the number known at that time was not quite  correct. We know that the spelling of the names was very much garbled  (to take one example only, the signs for _Sen_ were read as one sign  _Qebh_), so that one or two kings may have been omitted or displaced.  This may be the case with Narmer, or, as his name ought possibly to be  read, _Betjumer_. His monuments show by their style that he belongs to  the very beginning of the Ist Dynasty. No name in the Ist Dynasty list  corresponds to his. But one of the lists gives for the first king of the  IId Dynasty (the successor of \"Qebh\" = Sen) a name which may also be read  Betjumer, spelt syllabically this time, not ideographically. On this  account Prof. Naville wishes to regard the Hierakonpolite monuments of  Narmer as belonging to the IId Dynasty, but, as we have seen, they are  among the most archaic known, and certainly must belong to the beginning  of the Ist Dynasty. It is therefore probable that Khasekhemui Besh  and Narmer (Betjumer?) were confused by this list-maker, and the  name Betjumer was given to the first king of the IId Dynasty, who was  probably in reality Khasekhemui. The resemblance of _Betju_ to _Besh_  may have contributed to this confusion.    So Narmer (or Betjumer) found his way out of his proper place at the  beginning of the 1st Dynasty. Whether Aha was also called \"Men\" or not,  it seems evident that he and Narmer were jointly the originals of the  legendary Mena. Narmer, who possibly also bore the name of Sma, \"the  Uniter,\" conquered the North. Aha, \"the Fighter,\" also ruled both South  and North at the same period. Khasekhemui, too, conquered the North, but  the style of his monuments shows such an advance upon that of the days  of Aha and Narmer that it seems best to make him the successor of Sen  (or \"Qebh \"), and, explaining the transference of the name Betjumer  to the beginning of the IId Dynasty as due to a confusion with  Khasekhemui's personal name Besh, to make Khasekhemui the founder of the  IId Dynasty. The beginning of a new dynasty may well have been marked  by a reassertion of the new royal power over Lower Egypt, which may have  lapsed somewhat under the rule of the later kings of the Ist Dynasty.    Semti is certainly the \"Hesepti\" of the lists, and Tja Ati is probably  \"Ateth.\" \"Ata\" is thus unidentified. Prof. Petrie makes him = Merneit,  but, as has already been said, there is no proof that the tomb of  Merneit is that of a king. \"Teta\" may be Tjer or Khent, but of this  there is no proof. It is most probable that the names \"Teta,\" \"Ateth,\"  and \"Ata\" are all founded on Ati, the personal name of Tja. The king  Tjer is then not represented in the lists, and \"Mena\" is a compound of  the two oldest Abydos kings, Narmer (Betjumer) Sma (?) and Aha Men (?).    These are the bare historical results that have been attained with  regard to the names, identity, and order of the kings. The smaller  memorials that have been found with them, especially the ivory plaques,  have told us of events that took place during their reigns; but, with  the exception of the constantly recurring references to the conquest of  the North, there is little that can be considered of historical interest  or importance. We will take one as an example. This is the tablet No.  32,650 of the British Museum, illustrated by Prof. Petrie, _Royal Tombs_  i (Egypt Exploration Fund), pi. xi, 14, xv, 16. This is the record of  a single year, the first in the reign of Semti, King of Upper and Lower  Egypt. On it we see a picture of a king performing a religious dance  before the god Osiris, who is seated in a shrine placed on a dais. This  religious dance was performed by all the kings in later times. Below we  find hieroglyphic (ideographic) records of a river expedition to fight  the Northerners and of the capture of a fortified town called An. The  capture of the town is indicated by a broken line of fortification,  half-encircling the name, and the hoe with which the emblematic hawks  on the slate reliefs already described are armed; this signifies the  opening and breaking down of the wall.    On the other half of the tablet we find the viceroy of Lower Egypt,  Hemaka, mentioned; also \"the Hawk (i. e. the king) seizes the seat of  the Libyans,\" and some unintelligible record of a jeweller of the palace  and a king's carpenter. On a similar tablet (of Sen) we find the words  \"the king's carpenter made this record.\" All these little tablets are  then the records of single years of a king's life, and others like them,  preserved no doubt in royal archives, formed the base of regular annals,  which were occasionally carved upon stone. We have an example of one of  these in the \"Stele of Palermo,\" a fragment of black granite, inscribed  with the annals of the kings up to the time of the Vth Dynasty, when  the monument itself was made. It is a matter for intense regret that the  greater portion of this priceless historical monument has disappeared,  leaving us but a piece out of the centre, with part of the records  of only six kings before Snefru. Of these six the name of only one,  Neneter, of the lid Dynasty, whose name is also found at Abydos, is  mentioned. The only important historical event of Neneter's reign seems  to have occurred in his thirteenth year, when the towns or palaces of  _Ha_ (\"North\") and Shem-Ra (\"The Sun proceeds\") were founded. Nothing  but the institution and celebration of religious festivals is recorded  in the sixteen yearly entries preserved to us out of a reign of  thirty-five years. The annual height of the Nile is given, and the  occasions of numbering the people are recorded (every second year):  nothing else. Manetho tells us that in the reign of Binothris, who  is Neneter, it was decreed that women could hold royal honours and  privileges. This first concession of women's rights is not mentioned on  the strictly official \"Palerm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17322"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 2 (of 12) (#12)"],[1," ran in  front of the house, and two plots of ground, planted with vines in full  bearing, amply supplied the owner with wine every year.    [Illustration: 075.jpg PLAN OF THE VILLA OF A GREAT EGYPTIAN NOBLE]         This plan is taken from a Theban tomb of the XVIIIth       dynasty; but it corresponds exactly with the description       which Amten has left us of his villa.    It was there, doubtless, that Amten ended his days in peace and quietude  of mind. The tableland whereon the Sphinx has watched for so many  centuries was then crowned by no pyramids, but mastabas of fine white  stone rose here and there from out of the sand: that in which the mummy  of Amten was to be enclosed was situated not far from the modern village  of Abusir, on the confines of the nome of the Haunch, and almost in  sight of the mansion in which his declining years were spent.*         * The site of Amten's manorial mansion is nowhere mentioned       in the inscriptions; but the custom of the Egyptians to       construct their tombs as near as possible to the places       where they resided, leads me to consider it as almost       certain that we ought to look for its site in the Memphite       plain, in the vicinity of the town of Abusir, but in a       northern direction, so as to keep within the territory of       the Letopolite nome, where Amten governed in the name of the       king.    The number of persons of obscure origin, who in this manner had risen in  a few years to the highest honours, and died governors of provinces or  ministers of Pharaoh, must have been considerable. Their descendants  followed in their fathers' footsteps, until the day came when royal  favour or an advantageous marriage secured them the possession of an  hereditary fief, and transformed the son or grandson of a prosperous  scribe into a feudal lord. It was from people of this class, and from  the children of the Pharaoh, that the nobility was mostly recruited.  In the Delta, where the authority of the Pharaoh was almost everywhere  directly felt, the power of the nobility was weakened and much  curtailed; in Middle Egypt it gained ground, and became stronger and  stronger in proportion as one advanced southward. The nobles held the  principalities of the Gazelle, of the Hare, of the Serpent Mountain, of  Akhmim, of Thinis, of Qasr-es-Sayad, of El-Kab, of Aswan, and doubtless  others of which we shall some day discover the monuments.

They accepted without difficulty the fiction according to which Pharaoh  claimed to be absolute master of the soil, and ceded to his subjects  only the usufruct of their fiefs; but apart from the admission of the  principle, each lord proclaimed himself sovereign in his own domain, and  exercised in it, on a small scale, complete royal authority.    [Illustration: 078.jpg PRINCE API, BORNE IN A PALANQUIN, INSPECTS HIS  FUNERARY DOMAIN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-       Bey. The tomb of Api was discovered at Saqqara in 1884. It       had been pulled down in ancient times, and a new tomb built       on its ruins, about the time of the XIIth dynasty; all that       remains of it is now in the museum at Gizeh.    Everything within the limits of this petty state belonged to him--woods,  canals, fields, even the desert-sand: after the example of the Pharaoh,  he farmed a part himself, and let out the remainder, either in farms or  as fiefs, to those of his followers who had gained his confidence or  his friendship. After the example of Pharaoh, also, he was a priest, and  exercised priestly functions in relation to all the gods--that is,  not of all Egypt, but of all the deities of the nome. He was an  administrator of civil and criminal law, received the complaints of his  vassals and serfs at the gate of his palace, and against his decisions  there was no appeal. He kept up a flotilla, and raised on his estate a  small army, of which he was commander-in-chief by hereditary right. He  inhabited a fortified mansion, situated sometimes within the capital of  the principality itself, sometimes in its neighbourhood, and in which  the arrangements of the royal city were reproduced on a smaller scale.    [Illustration: 079.jpg A DWARF PLAYING WITH CYNOCEPHALI AND A TAME IBIS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a chromolithograph in Flinders       Petrie's _Medum,_ pl. xxiv.    Side by side with the reception halls was the harem, where the  legitimate wife, often a princess of solar rank, played the role of  queen, surrounded by concubines, dancers, and slaves. The offices of  the various departments were crowded into the enclosure, with their  directors, governors, scribes of all ranks, custodians, and workmen, who  bore the same titles as the corresponding employes in the departments of  the State: their White Storehouse, their Gold Storehouse, their Granary,  were at times called the Double White Storehouse, the Double Gold  Storehouse, the Double Granary, as were those of the Pharaoh. Amusements  at the court of the vassal did not differ from those at that of the  sovereign: hunting in the desert and the marshes, fishing, inspection of  agricultural works, military exercises, games, songs, dancing, doubtless  the recital of long stories, and exhibitions of magic, even down to the  contortions of the court buffoon and the grimaces of the dwarfs.    [Illustration: 080.jpg IN A NILE BOAT]    It amused the prince to see one of these wretched favourites leading to  him by the paw a cynocephalus larger than himself, while a mischievous  monkey slyly pulled a tame and stately ibis by the tail. From time to  time the great lord proceeded to inspect his domain: on these occasions  he travelled in a kind of sedan chair, supported by two mules yoked  together; or he was borne in a palanquin by some thirty men, while  fanned by large flabella; or possibly he went up the Nile and the canals  in his beautiful painted barge. The life of the Egyptian lords may be  aptly described as in every respect an exact reproduction of the life of  the Pharaoh on a smaller scale.    Inheritance in a direct or indirect line was the rule, but in every  case of transmission the new lord had to receive the investiture of  the sovereign either by letter or in person. The duties enforced by the  feudal state do not appear to have been onerous. In the first place,  there was the regular payment of a tribute, proportionate to the  extent and resources of the fief. In the next place, there was military  service: the vassal agreed to supply, when called upon, a fixed number  of armed men, whom he himself commanded, unless he could offer a  reasonable excuse such as illness or senile incapacity.*         * Prince Amoni, of the Gazelle nome, led a body of four       hundred men and another body of six hundred, levied in his       principality, into Ethiopia under these conditions; the       first that he served in the royal army, was as a substitute       for his father, who had grown too old. Similarly, under the       XVIIIth dynasty, Ahmosis of El-Kab commanded the war-ship,       the Calf, in place of his father. The Uni inscription       furnishes us with an instance of a general levy of the       feudal contingents in the time of the VIth dynasty (1. 14,       et seq.).    Attendance at court was not obligatory: we notice, however, many nobles  about the person of Pharaoh, and there are numerous examples of princes,  with whose lives we are familiar, filling offices which appear to have  demanded at least a temporary residence in the palace, as, for instance,  the charge of the royal wardrobe. When the king travelled, the great  vassals were compelled to entertain him and his suite, and to escort  him to the frontier of their domain. On the occasion of such visits, the  king would often take away with him one of their sons to be brought  up with his own children: an act which they on their part considered a  great honour, while the king on his had a guarantee of their fidelity in  the person of these hostages. Such of these young people as returned to  their fathers' roof when their education was finished, were usually most  loyal to the reigning dynasty. They often brought back with them  some maiden born in the purple, who consented to share their little  provincial sovereignty, while in exchange one or more of their sisters  entered the harem of the Pharaoh. Marriages made and marred in their  turn the fortunes of the great feudal houses. Whether she were  a princess or not, each woman received as her dowry a portion of  territory, and enlarged by that amount her husband's little state;  but the property she brought might, in a few years, be taken by her  daughters as portions and enrich other houses. The fief seldom could  bear up against such dismemberment; it fell away piecemeal, and by  the third or fourth generation had disappeared. Sometimes, however,  it gained more than it lost in this matrimonial game, and extended its  borders till they encroached on neighbouring nomes or else completely  absorbed them. There were always in the course of each reign several  great principalities formed, or in the process of formation, whose  chiefs might be said to hold in their hands the destinies of the  country. Pharaoh himself was obliged to treat them with deference,  and he purchased their allegiance by renewed and ever-increasing  concessions.    Their ambition was never satisfied; when they were loaded with favours,  and did not venture to ask for more for themselves, they impudently  demanded them for such of their children as they thought were poorly  provided for. Their eldest son \"knew not the high favours which came  from the king. Other princes were his privy counsellers, his chosen  friends, or foremost among his friends!\" he had no"]]]
