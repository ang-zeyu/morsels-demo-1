Let every one join together to produce this  effect. Let the suggestion act strongly on his mind that all these  troubles of sleeplessness are diminishing, that night after night sees  an improvement, and soon his reputation as a good sleeper will be  established, and, as always with children, it will be rigidly adhered  to.    In assisting to break the habit of sleeplessness, and in the process  of altering the character of the suggestions which act on the child's  mind, we can be of the greatest assistance to the mother by  prescribing a suitable hypnotic. As to whether it is right in insomnia  in childhood to prescribe depressant drugs is a question on which very  various opinions are held. That it is wrong and probably ineffective  to trust entirely to the drugs is certainly true, but as a temporary  measure, to break the faulty suggestion and the bad habit, their use  is both legitimate and successful. The dose required in children  relatively to the adult is much smaller. In grown people, some  specific distress of mind, whether real or imaginary, may suffice to  resist very large doses of hypnotic. In children it is rare to find  the same resistance, and comparatively small doses have a very  constant effect. With deeper and more refreshing sleep, the conduct of  the child during the day almost always changes for the better. A sound  sleep, for a few nights in succession, will produce apparently quite a  remarkable change in the whole disposition of the child. When good  temper and interest take the place of fretfulness and restlessness, we  may confidently expect that the symptom of sleeplessness will begin to  abate. Sleeplessness by night and fretfulness by day form a vicious  circle, and attempts must be made to break it at all points.    Chloral occupies the first place as a hypnotic for young children. In  combination with bromide its effects are wonderfully constant and  certain. Two grains of chloral hydrate and two grains of potassium  bromide with ten minims of syrup of orange, given just before bedtime,  will bring sound sleep to a child of a year old. At three years the  dose may be twice as great, and three times at six years. It is seldom  that other means are required. Aspirin for children seems relatively  without effect. For children who are both sleepless and feverish, a  grain of Dover's powder, and a grain of antipyrin, for each year of  the child's age up to three, is very helpful. Lastly, if chloral and  bromide cannot break the insomnia, and the condition of the child is  becoming distressing, we can almost always succeed if we combine the  prescription with an ordinary hot pack for twenty minutes.          CHAPTER V    SOME OTHER SIGNS OF NERVOUSNESS      HABIT SPASM    Next to refusal of food and refusal of sleep perhaps the most frequent  manifestation of nervous unrest is provided by the group of symptoms  which we may call, with a certain latitude of expression, Habit  Spasms. By a habit spasm is meant the constant repetition of an action  which was originally designed to produce some one definite result, but  which has become involuntary, habitual, and separated from its  original meaning. The nervous cough forms a good example of a habit  spasm. A cough may lose its purpose and persist only as a bad habit,  especially in moments of nervousness, as in talking to strangers, in  entering a room, or at the moment of saying \"How do you do\" or  \"Good-bye.\" Twitching the mouth, swallowing, elongating the upper lip,  biting the lips, wrinkling the forehead so strongly that the whole  scalp may be put into movement, and blepharospasm are all common  tricks of little children which may become habitual and uncontrolled.  In worse cases there may be constant jerking movements of the head,  nodding movements, or even bowing salaam-like movements. In mild  cases we may note hardly more than a restless movement of mouth or  forehead, or constant plucking or writhing of the fingers whenever the  child's attention is aroused, when he is spoken to, or when he himself  speaks. In nervous children these movements, which should properly be  confined to moments of real emotional stress, become habitual, and are  displayed apart from the excitement of particular emotions. Whatever  their intensity, habitual and involuntary movements of this nature  should not be overlooked, and should be regarded as evidence of mental  unrest. They do not commonly appear during the first or second years  of the child's life. They are more frequent after the age of five, but  they may begin to be marked as early as the third year. With refusal  of food and refusal of sleep they form the three common neuroses of  early childhood.    Two of the three qualities which we have mentioned as characteristic  of the child's mind are concerned in the causation of habit spasm. In  the early stages the movement is sometimes due to imitation, but the  susceptibility of the child to suggestion plays the chief part in  determining its persistence. It is an interesting speculation how far  tricks of gesture, attitude, or gait are inherited and how far they  are acquired by imitation. A child by some characteristic gesture may  strikingly call to mind a parent who died in his infancy. A whole  family may show a peculiarity of gait which is at once recognisable.  It is told of the son of a famous man, who shared with his father the  distinctive family gait, that when a boy his ears were once boxed by  an old gentleman who chanced to observe him hurrying to overtake his  parent, and who resented what he took to be an act of impertinent  caricature. In the reproduction by the child of the habitual actions  of his parents, heredity is largely concerned, but imitation too plays  its part. In habit spasm the force of imitation is clearly seen. A  child who has developed a habit spasm of one sort or another will  readily serve as a model to other children. The malady will sometimes  spread through a school almost with the force of a contagious  disorder. A child affected in this way may prove an unwelcome guest.  The little visitor with a trick of contorting his mouth and grimacing  is apt to leave his small host an expert in faithfully reproducing the  action. A cough that is genuine enough in one member of the family may  produce a crop of counterfeits in brothers and sisters.    The force of suggestion acting upon the child's mind can clearly be  traced. Once his attention is focused upon the particular movement by  unwise emphasis on the part of the parents, he loses the power to  control its occurrence. This trio of common neuroses--refusal of food,  refusal of sleep, and habitual involuntary movement--grows only in an  atmosphere of unrest and apprehension. Parents and nurses anxiously  watch their development. They are distressed beyond measure to note  their steady growth in spite of every attempt which they make to  control or forbid them. And of all this unrest and unhappiness the  child is acutely conscious. The whole household may become obsessed  with the misfortune which has befallen it, and the mother, losing all  sense of proportion, feels that she cannot regain her peace of mind  until it has been overcome. The child is in need of mental and moral  support from those around him, and all that he finds is an openly  expressed apprehension and sense of impotence. Even grown-up people,  when their nerves are on edge, are apt to be obsessed by  uncontrollable impulses or by vague and nameless apprehensions, and  surely all have learnt the support they gain from contact and  conversation with some one strong and sane, who treats their worries  in such a matter-of-fact way that immediately they lose their power  and become of no account. The child with habit spasm cannot control  these movements. The more he is reproved or entreated, the less able  does he find himself to hold them in check. He does not wish them to  continue. He has lost control of what he once controlled, and the  realisation of this is not pleasant, and may be alarming to him. Yet  when unconsciously he looks to his mother for support, he finds in her  open dismay that which serves only to increase his uneasiness. She  must subdue her own feelings and give the child strength. If she  treats the whole thing in a matter-of-fact way, as a temporary  disturbance which is of no importance in itself, and only has meaning  because it implies that the brain has been over-stimulated, she will  no longer exercise a prejudicial effect on the child. If the bad habit  is taken as a matter of course, if too much is not made of it, if the  child is encouraged to think that nobody cares much about it at all,  then recovery will soon take place. It goes without saying that habit  spasms and tics of all sorts are made worse by excessive emotional  display and by nervous fatigue. On the other hand, if the child  becomes absorbed in some interesting occupation, the movements will  disappear for the time being.      AIR SWALLOWING, THIGH RUBBING, THUMB SUCKING    At a somewhat earlier age than that in which habit spasms become  common, and before bed wetting appears as a formidable difficulty, we  meet with another group of habitual actions which yet retain their  voluntary character. Among such habitual actions are thumb sucking,  thigh rubbing, and air swallowing. If the child is old enough to  express himself on the subject, he will explain that these actions are  performed because of the satisfaction derived from them, because it is  \"comfy\" and \"nice.\" Even if the child is too small to speak, the  expression is that of beatitude and content. These actions are not  confined to nervous children, and their occasional practice need not  be taken to imply that there is any strong element of nervous  overstrain.
