Oh,  _how_ I wish I knew! Oh, how very, _very_ much I wish I knew!\" Her  curiosity increased every minute as she went step by step towards the  sea, until when she had gone scarcely a hundred paces she stopped short  and said, \"I must know what is inside this sack before I go any farther.  I will take just one tiny little peep, and He will never know it.\"    Very carefully she untied the neck of the sack. Buzz! Whirr! Hum! Zim!  She had opened it but a tiny little crack when out crawled and hopped  and flew the millions and swarms and colonies of all kinds of insects,  and away they scattered in every direction. Such a noise as filled the  air about the astonished woman's head! Such a wriggling and squirming  and hopping in the grass about her feet!    \"Oh, now I know what was in the sack!\" she cried. \"But I wish I had not  looked. Oh, whatever shall I do? He told me to throw the bag into the  ocean without looking in. But now the horrid creatures have escaped  everywhere and He will know what I have done. Oh, what will He do to  punish me?\"    She began to run hither and yon like a crazy woman, picking up the bugs  and jumping for the fluttering insects, trying to put them back into the  bag. They stung her and bit her and got into her eyes until she screamed  with pain. As fast as she caught one another escaped, and she soon saw  that it was a hopeless task. She could never catch the millions of  creatures who had scattered away to their homes in every corner of the  world.    Then the Lord came to her and said very sternly, \"O Woman, you have  disobeyed me, just as did the very first woman of all. And you must be  punished both for your disobedience and for your inquisitiveness which  has led you into the worse sin. Not until you have gathered up every one  of these insects which you have permitted to escape back into the world  shall you be happy. But I will give you wings to help you in the task.  You shall become a Woodpecker, and it shall be your task to hunt, hunt  for the insects which hide away so slyly at your approach. Not till the  last one of these is gobbled up from the earth shall you return to your  own shape and be a woman once more.\"    Then the Lord changed the inquisitive woman into a restless Woodpecker,  and with a \"tut-tut!\" she darted away in pursuit of the insects which  had brought her into such trouble.    And that is why to this day one sees the Woodpecker pecking so  frantically on the tree trunks, anxious lest a single insect should  escape. For she is very tired of being a bird, and is longing to become  a woman once more. But it will be a very long time, I fear, before she  gathers up all the wriggling, squirming, hopping, buzzing, stinging,  biting things that make life in the country so varied, exciting, and  musical.          WHY THE NIGHTINGALE WAKES      When the other birds are sound asleep in their nests, with their little  heads tucked comfortably under their feathers, Sister Nightingale, they  say, may not rest, but still sounds the notes of her beautiful song in  grove and thicket.    Why does she sing thus, all night long as well as through the day? It is  because she dares not go to sleep on account of the Blindworm, who is  waiting to catch her with her eyes closed.    Once upon a time, when the world was very new, the Blindworm was not  quite blind, but had one good eye. Moreover, in those days the  Nightingale also had but one eye. As for the Blindworm, it mattered very  little; for he was a homely creature, content to crawl about in the dark  underground, or under wood and leaves, where nobody saw him and nobody  cared. But the Nightingale's case was really quite too pitiful! Fancy  the sweetest singer among all the birds, the favorite chorister, going  about with but one eye, while every one else, even the tiniest little  Humming Bird of all, had two.    The Nightingale felt very sore about this matter, and tried to conceal  her misfortune from the other birds. She managed to cock her head the  other way whenever she met a friend, and she always flew past any  stranger so fast that he never saw the empty socket where her other  pretty eye should be.    But one day there was great excitement among the birds. Miss Jenny Wren  was going to be married to young Cock Robin. There was to be a grand  wedding; every one was invited, and of course the Nightingale was needed  to lead the bridal chorus of feathered songsters. But the poor  Nightingale was set in a flutter of anxiety by the news.    \"Oh, dear me!\" she said, \"I do want to go to Jenny's wedding, oh, of  course I do! But how can I go? If I do, the other birds will discover  that I have but one eye, and then how the disagreeable creatures will  laugh at me. Oh dear, oh dear! What shall I do? I cannot go, no, I  really cannot. But what excuse can I give? Oh, it is not right that the  sweetest singer in all Birdland should be laughed at, merely because she  has the misfortune to lack one poor little eye!\"    The Nightingale sat on the branch, singing so mournfully that all the  creatures on the ground below went sorrowfully about their daily  business. Just then the Nightingale spied a silvery gleam among the dead  leaves. It was the Blindworm, a spotted gray streak, writhing  noiselessly along towards the decayed wood of a fallen tree, in which he  loved to burrow. And the Blindworm was not sad like the others, neither  seemed he to care in the least about the Nightingale's music. Worms  think little of sweet sounds. He cocked his one eye up towards the  Nightingale and winked maliciously. He alone of all creatures knew the  Nightingale's secret.    \"Good-day, Sister Nightingale,\" he said. \"How is your eye this morning?  We have a goodly pair between us; though I think that mine is rather the  better of the two.\"    Then he disappeared into a tiny opening. For though the Blindworm is  nearly a foot long he is so smooth and slippery that he can enter a hole  which is almost smaller than himself.    The Nightingale was very indignant at being addressed in this familiar  way by a miserable, crawling creature who not only could not fly, but  who could not sing a note, and did not know _do_ from _fa_.  Besides, it made her angry to think that he knew her secret and talked  aloud about it so that any one might hear.    \"The idea!\" she cried. \"It is bad enough that I cannot go to the wedding  of my dear friend Jenny. But to be jeered at by this creature, it is  more than I can bear. Ha! I have an idea. I will punish him and help  myself at the same time. I will steal his one eye and wear it to Jenny  Wren's wedding; then no one will ever discover my misfortune.\"    Now this was an excellent scheme, but it was not so easy to carry it out  as the Nightingale had thought. For the Blindworm was very timid and  kept himself carefully hidden in his burrow of soft soil, as if he half  suspected the Nightingale's plans. Day after day the Nightingale kept  eager watch upon his movements, and at last, on the very eve of the  wedding, when she had almost given up hope, she spied the Blindworm  sound asleep on the moss under a tall tree.    \"Ha!\" said the Nightingale to herself very softly. \"Now is my chance!\"  She fluttered into the top of the oak tree, and from there hopped down  from branch to branch, from twig to twig, until she was directly over  the sleeper's ugly head, over the one closed eye. Then _whirr_! Down  she pounced upon the Blindworm. And before the creature had a chance to  know what was happening, the Nightingale had stolen his eye, and had  popped it into place in the empty socket on the other side of her beak.    \"Ha, ha!\" she sang merrily. \"Now I have two bright eyes, as good as any  one's. Now I can go to Jenny Wren's wedding as gayly as I please, and no  one shall see more of the ceremony than I. I shall be able to tell just  exactly how the bride is dressed, how every little feather is arranged,  and how she looks after Parson Crow has pronounced the blessing. Oh, how  happy I am!\"    But the poor Blindworm, blind indeed from that day forth, began to cry  and lament, begging the Nightingale to give him back his eye.    \"Nay,\" said the Nightingale, \"did you not laugh at me when you saw me  sadly sitting on the tree, mourning because I could not go to the  wedding? Now I have stolen your eye, and I can see famously. But you  will never again see me sitting sadly on the tree.\"    Then the Blindworm grew very angry. \"I will get the eye back!\" he cried.  \"I will steal it from you, as you stole it from me, some time when you  are asleep. I will climb up into your nest some night, and I will take  both your eyes of which you are so proud. Then you will be blind,  wholly blind as I am now.\"    At these threatening words the Nightingale ceased to sing and became  silent with fear. For she knew that the Blindworm would do as he said.  But again a brilliant thought came to her.    \"Nay!\" she trilled gladly. \"That you shall never do. I will never sleep  again. I will keep awake always, night and day, with my two bright eyes  ever looking out for danger. Yes, yes, yes! No one shall ever catch me  napping.\"    \"You cannot help yourself,\" said the Blindworm. \"You cannot keep awake.  You will drowse in spite of everything. I shall yet find you asleep some  night, and then beware!\"    \"Nay, nay!\" warbled the Nightingale, as she flew away to make herself  fine for the wedding. \"I shall sing, sing, sing night and day henceforth  to keep myself awake. And thus I need not fear. Farewell-well-well!\"    And so the Nightingale went to the wedding and sang more sweetly in the  bridal chorus than she had ever sung before. And after that, although  she was weary, oh, so weary! she sang all night long, and all the next  night and the next. And so she has continued to sing ever since in the  lands which are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#12)"],[1," a  glimmering of hope remained; but I felt convinced from the general  appearance of the country that there was not the slightest probability of  our finding water there, and resolved therefore still to continue a  direct route. When I gave this order the weak-minded quailed before it:  they would rather have perished in wandering up and down those arid and  inhospitable banks than have made a great effort and have torn themselves  away from the vain and delusive hopes this watercourse held out to them.    With great pain I witnessed and bore my part in this distressing scene,  but I at the moment felt that it would be necessary to save my energies  for other occasions; suspecting that we were in a great tract of desert  country, a large portion of which must still be passed ere we could hope  for any alleviation from our sufferings; and I therefore at once  commenced carrying into execution the order I had given, by walking on in  a south by east direction. In about two miles we had gained the summit of  the low range which bounded to the southward the valley where we had so  vainly searched for water, and for the next ten miles we travelled over  elevated sandy barren plains, thinly wooded with occasional clumps of  Banksia trees.    DRY TEA-TREE SWAMP.    On our left was a lofty and well wooded range, distant only about four  miles, and on our right lay extensive plains, the western extremity of  which, distant about sixteen miles from us, was by the sea; these plains  appeared tolerably fertile, being covered with tea-tree swamps, now  apparently dried up. I still was led on by the hope, raised by the height  of the range on our left, that we might find water issuing from it  towards the coast, and had therefore not searched the plains which lay  between us and the sea, indeed I felt fully convinced that the swamps we  saw were all perfectly dry and the native coincided in my opinion; about  an hour before sunset however we descended towards the plains, and  turning due west we reached them in about half an hour, but found all the  swamps quite destitute of water. As soon as it became dark I lit my fire  and laid down by it, advising the others to pursue the same course and to  preserve their energies for the morrow. But such advice was thrown away  upon men almost perishing with thirst, and every now and then throughout  the night I heard their weak husky voices as they wandered from swamp to  swamp in the neighbourhood, digging holes with pointed sticks in a vain  search.    NATIVE SONGS.    Poor Kaiber alone lay crouching by my fire, occasionally feeding it with  fresh fuel and chanting to himself these two songs, in his own language:    Thither, mother oh, I return again,  Thither oh, I return again.    The other had been sung by the mother of Miago, a native who had  accompanied Captain Wickham in the Beagle from the Swan River, and it had  made a great impression on the natives.    Whither does that lone ship wander,  My young son I shall never see again.  Whither does that lone ship wander.    EXTREME FEEBLENESS OF THE PARTY.    The night wore heavily on; sleepless sufferers were around me, and I  myself began to feel very anxious as to what the next day might bring.  The men had now been already one night and two days without tasting a  single drop of water or food of any kind whatever, for as the only  provisions they had left was a spoonful or two of flour each it was  impossible for them to cook this without water; indeed only two of them  had even this small supply of flour left, and the rest were wholly  destitute.    I personally suffered far less than any of the others with the exception  of the native, and this for several reasons. In the first place I had  been long accustomed to subsist on a very small quantity of water, and  secondly I had always kept my mind occupied and amused instead of giving  way to desponding or gloomy thoughts. When we halted and the others laid  wearily down, brooding over their melancholy situation, I employed myself  in writing up my journal, which was most scrupulously kept; and this duty  being concluded I had recourse to a small New Testament, my companion  throughout all my wanderings, and from this latter I drank in such deep  draughts of comfort that my spirits were always good.    DANGER OF PERISHING FOR WANT OF WATER.    April 17.    About an hour and a half before dawn we started in a south by east  direction, the native leading the way, for it was yet too dark for me to  select points to march upon. As we moved along we moistened our mouths by  sucking a few drops of dew from the shrubs and reeds, but even this  miserable resource failed us almost immediately after sunrise. The men  were so worn out from fatigue and want of food and water that I could get  them but a few hundred yards at a time, then some one of them would sit  down and beg me so earnestly to stop for a few minutes that I could not  refuse acceding to the request; when however I thus halted the native in  every instance expressed his indignation, telling me that it was  sacrificing his safety as well as those of the others who were able to  move, for that if we did not find water ere night the whole party would  die. He was indeed as weak from want of food as any of us, for we had  made such rapid and lengthy marches in the hope of speedily forwarding  assistance to those left behind that when we came at night to the  conclusion of our day's journey Kaiber was too much exhausted to think of  looking for food.    About two o'clock in the afternoon the men were so completely exhausted  that it was impossible to induce them to move, and at this period I found  that we had only made about eight miles in a south by east direction,  over plains studded with small sandy hills and the beds of dried up  tea-tree swamps.    When I halted the sun was intensely powerful; the groans and exclamations  of some of the men were painful in the extreme; but my feelings were  still more agonized when I saw the poor creatures driven, by the want of  water, to drink their own ----, the last sad and revolting resource of  thirst!    UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH FOR WATER WITH KAIBER.    Unable to bear these distressing scenes any longer I ordered Kaiber to  accompany me, and notwithstanding the heat and my own weariness I left  the others lying down in such slight shade as the stunted banksias  afforded, and throwing aside all my ammunition, papers, etc., started  with him in search of water, carrying nothing but my double-barrelled  gun. We proceeded towards the sea. As the natives have the faculty, even  in the trackless woods which they have never before been in, of returning  direct to any spot they have left by however circuitous a course they may  have travelled after quitting it, I paid no attention to the direction we  were moving in but followed Kaiber, who roamed from spot to spot in the  vain search of water; but we found not a drop. The same arid barren  country seemed spread on every side; and when at length I began  occasionally to stumble and fall from weakness hope abandoned me, and I  determined to return direct to my comrades and get them to make one more  effort to proceed and search for it in a southerly direction.    TREACHEROUS INTENTIONS OF KAIBER, THE NATIVE.    I therefore told Kaiber that such was my intention, and directed him to  guide me to the party. With apparent alacrity he obeyed my orders; but  after leading me about some time in an extraordinary manner he told me  that he had lost his way and could not find them. His look was so very  plausible when he said this, and he seemed so grieved at the  circumstance, that for a moment I believed his tale; but I felt convinced  that we could not be at any very great distance from them and therefore  fired one barrel of my gun; the echo of this sound, never heard in these  solitudes before, rang loudly through the woods, remoter distances caught  it up, and at length it gradually died away: anxiously did I now listen  for a repetition of the report, for I knew, were they within hearing, the  men would instantly fire again to acknowledge the signal I had made; but  minute after minute passed on and no answering signal struck my ear. I  sat down and applied my ear to the ground; every sense became absorbed in  the single one of hearing, but not the remotest sound that I could  distinguish broke the frightful solitude of these vast woods. I remained  seated on the ground for a few minutes, still hearing no answer to my  shot, till the conviction gradually forced itself on my mind that the  native had been leading me astray. Only two cases could have occurred:  either he had done so purposely, for he could not, by any accidental  mistake, have taken me to such a distance as to prevent the party in  these silent woods hearing the report of my gun, or otherwise the men had  of themselves moved away from the place where I had left them. But I felt  assured that this latter supposition was not correct, for ever since I  quitted the other portion of the party I had maintained so strict a  discipline that no man ever separated from the rest without my  permission; indeed I had increased my strictness in these respects  exactly in proportion to our increasing difficulties; and I moreover felt  sure that some of the men were by far too much attached to me ever to  abandon me in such a manner.    My situation however was undoubtedly very critical, not as far as  regarded my own safety, for I was not now more than eighty miles from the  nearest settler's hut; but was it possible for me to return alone to my  countrymen and to say that I had lost all my comrades? that I had saved  myself and left the others to perish? Yet I knew that unless I sent  assistance to the first party I had left the majority of them could not  survive; and from the state I had, about an hour and a half ago, left the  others in, it appeared more than probable that they might"]]]
