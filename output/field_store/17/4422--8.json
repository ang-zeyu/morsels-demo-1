The contrast between the glory of Oliver's Dutch War and the shame of  Charles the Second's sank deep into Marvell's heart, and lent bitterness  to many of his later satirical lines.    Marvell's famous _Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland_ in  1650 has a curious bibliographical interest. So far as we can tell, it  was first published in 1776. When it was composed we do not know. At  Nunappleton House Oliver was not a _persona grata_ in 1650, for he had  no sooner come back from Ireland than he had stepped into the shoes of  the Lord-General Fairfax; and there were those, Lady Fairfax, I doubt  not, among the number, who believed that the new Lord-General thought it  was high time he should be where Fairfax's \"scruple\" at last put him. We  may be sure Cromwell's character was dissected even more than it was  extolled at Nunappleton. The famous Ode is by no means a panegyric, and  its true hero is the \"Royal actor,\" whom Cromwell, so the poem suggests,  lured to his doom. It is not likely that the Ode was composed after  Marvell had left Nunappleton, though it may have been so before he went  there. There is an old untraceable tradition that Marvell was among the  crowd that saw the king die. What deaths have been witnessed, and with  what strange apparent apathy, by the London crowd! But for this  tradition one's imagination would trace to Lady Fairfax the most famous  of the stanzas.    But to return to the history of the Ode. In 1776 Captain Edward  Thompson, a connection of the Marvell family and a versatile sailor with  a passion for print, which had taken some odd forms of expression,  produced by subscription in three quarto volumes the first collected  edition of Andrew Marvell's works, both verse and prose. Such an edition  had been long premeditated by Thomas Hollis, one of the best friends  literature had in the eighteenth century. It was Hollis who gave to  Sidney Sussex College the finest portrait in existence of Oliver  Cromwell. Hollis collected material for an edition of Marvell with the  aid of Richard Barron, an early editor of Milton's prose works, and of  Algernon Sidney's _Discourse concerning Government_. Barron, however,  lost zeal as the task proceeded, and complained justly enough \"of a want  of anecdotes,\" and as the printer, the well-known and accomplished  Bowyer, doubted the wisdom of the undertaking, it was allowed to drop.  Barron died in 1766, and Hollis in 1774, but the collections made by the  latter passed into the hands of Captain Thompson, who, with the  assistance of Mr. Robert Nettleton, a grandson of one of Marvell's  sisters, at once began to get his edition ready. On Nettleton's death  his \"Marvell\" papers came into Thompson's hands, and among them was, to  quote the captain's own words, \"a volume of Mr. Marvell's poems, some  written with his own hand and the rest copied by his order.\"    The _Horatian Ode_ was in this volume, and was printed from it in  Thompson's edition of 1776.    What has become of this manuscript book? It has disappeared--destroyed,  so we are led to believe, in a fit of temper by the angry and uncritical  sea-captain.    This precious volume undoubtedly contained some poems by Marvell, and as  his handwriting was both well known from many examples, and is highly  characteristic, we may also be certain that the captain was not mistaken  in his assertion that some of these poems were in Marvell's own  handwriting. But, as ill-luck would have it, the volume also contained  poems written at a later period and in quite another hand. Among these  latter pieces were Addison's verses, _The Spacious Firmament on High_  and _When all thy Mercies, O my God_; Dr. Watts' paraphrase _When Israel  freed from Pharaoh's Hand_; and Mallet's ballad _William and Margaret_.  The two Addison pieces and the Watts paraphrase appeared for the first  time in the _Spectator_, Nos. 453, 465, and 461, in 1712, and Mallet's  ballad was first printed in 1724.    Still there these pieces were, in manuscript, in this volume, and as  there were circumstances of mystification attendant upon their prior  publication, what does the captain do but claim them all, _Songs of  Zion_ and sentimental ballad alike, as Marvell's. This of course brought  the critics, ever anxious to air their erudition, down upon his head,  raised his anger, and occasioned the destruction of the book.    Mr. Grosart says that Captain Thompson states that the _Horatian Ode_  was in Marvell's handwriting. I cannot discover where this statement is  made, though it is made of other poems in the volume, also published for  the first time by the captain.    All, therefore, we know is that the Ode was first published in 1776 by  an editor who says he found it copied in a book, subsequently destroyed,  which contained (among other things) some poems written in Marvell's  handwriting, and that this book was given to the editor by a  grand-nephew of the poet.    Yet I imagine, poor as this evidence may seem to be, no student of  Marvell's life and character (so far as his life reveals his character),  and of his verse (so much of it as is positively known), wants more  evidence to satisfy him that the _Horatian Ode_ is as surely Marvell's  as the lines upon _Appleton House_, the _Bermudas_, _To his Coy  Mistress_, and _The Garden_.    The great popularity of this Ode undoubtedly rests on the three  stanzas:--        \"That thence the royal actor borne,      The tragic scaffold might adorn,        While round the armed bands;        Did clap their bloody hands:        He nothing common did, or mean,      Upon that memorable scene,        But with his keener eye        The axe's edge did try;        Nor called the gods with vulgar spite      To vindicate his helpless right,        But bowed his comely head        Down, as upon a bed.\"    It is strange that the death of the king should be so nobly sung in an  Ode bearing Cromwell's name and dedicate to his genius:--        \"So restless Cromwell could not cease      In the inglorious arts of peace,        But through adventurous war        Urged his active star;        ...        Then burning through the air he went,      And palaces and temples rent;        And Caesar's head at last        Did through his laurels blast.        'Tis madness to resist or blame      The force of angry Heaven's flame;        And if we would speak true,        Much to the man is due,        Who, from his private gardens, where      He lived reserved and austere,        (As if his highest plot        To plant the bergamot),        Could by industrious valour climb      To ruin the great work of time,        And cast the kingdoms old        Into another mould.\"    The last stanzas of all have much pith and meaning in them:--        \"But thou, the war's and fortune's son,      March indefatigably on!        And for the last effect,        Still keep the sword erect.        Besides the force it has to fright      The spirits of the shady night,        The same arts that did gain        A power, must it maintain.\"[67:1]    It is not surprising that this Ode was not published in 1650--if indeed  it was the work of that, and not of a later year. There is nothing  either of the courtier or of the partisan about its stately  versification and sober, solemn thought. Entire self-possession,  dignity, criticism of a great man and a strange career by one well  entitled to criticise, are among the chief characteristics of this noble  poem. It is infinitely refreshing, when reading and thinking about  Cromwell, to get as far away as possible from the fanatic's scream and  the fury of the bigot, whether of the school of Laud or Hobbes. Andrew  Marvell knew Oliver Cromwell alive, and gazed on his features as he lay  dead--he knew his ambition, his greatness, his power, and where that  power lay. How much might we unwittingly have lost, if Captain Thompson  had not printed a poem which for more than a century of years had  remained unknown, and exposed to all the risks of a single manuscript  copy!    When Cromwell sent his picture to Queen Christina of Sweden to  commemorate the peace he concluded with her in 1654, Marvell, though not  then attached to the public service, was employed to write the Latin  couplet that accompanied the picture. He discharged his task as  follows:--        _In effigiem Oliveri Cromwell_.        \"Haec est quae toties inimicos umbra fugavit        At sub qua cives otia lenta terunt.\"    The authorship of these lines is often attributed to Milton, but there  is little doubt they are of Marvell's composition. They might easily  have been better.    Marvell became Milton's assistant in September 1657, and the friendship  between the two men was thus consolidated by the strong ties of a  common duty. Milton's blindness making him unfit to attend the reception  of foreign embassies, Marvell took his place and joined in respectfully  greeting the Dutch ambassadors. After all he was but a junior clerk,  still he doubtless rejoiced that his lines on Holland had been published  anonymously. Literature was strongly represented in this department of  State just then, for Cromwell's Chamberlain, Sir Gilbert Pickering, who  represented Northamptonshire in Parliament, had taken occasion to  introduce his nephew, John Dryden, to the public service, and he was  attached to the same office as Andrew Marvell.

She had wondered if he  would notice her. She really wanted him to see her skip.    \"Well!\" he exclaimed. \"Upon my word! P'raps tha' art a young 'un, after  all, an' p'raps tha's got child's blood in thy veins instead of sour  buttermilk. Tha's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name's Ben  Weatherstaff. I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it.\"    \"I never skipped before,\" Mary said. \"I'm just beginning. I can only go  up to twenty.\"    \"Tha' keep on,\" said Ben. \"Tha' shapes well enough at it for a young 'un  that's lived with heathen. Just see how he's watchin' thee,\" jerking his  head toward the robin. \"He followed after thee yesterday. He'll be at  it again to-day. He'll be bound to find out what th' skippin'-rope is.  He's never seen one. Eh!\" shaking his head at the bird, \"tha' curosity  will be th' death of thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp.\"    Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every  few minutes. At length she went to her own special walk and made up her  mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good long  skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down the  path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She did  not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stopped  with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin  swaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and he greeted her  with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in  her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the robin  she laughed again.    \"You showed me where the key was yesterday,\" she said. \"You ought to  show me the door to-day; but I don't believe you know!\"    The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall  and he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show  off. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when  he shows off--and they are nearly always doing it.    Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah's stories,  and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.    One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a  stronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of  the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing  sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close to  the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy  trails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in  her hand. This she did because she had seen something under it--a round  knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it. It was the  knob of a door.    She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them  aside. Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging  curtain, though some had crept over wood and iron. Mary's heart began to  thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement. The  robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side,  as if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands which  was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?    It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put  her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the  keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it,  but it did turn.    And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk  to see if any one was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come,  it seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not help  it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the  door which opened slowly--slowly.    Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her  back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with  excitement, and wonder, and delight.    She was standing _inside_ the secret garden.          CHAPTER IX    THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANY ONE EVER LIVED IN      It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could  imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless  stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted  together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great  many roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry  brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rose-bushes  if they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had so  spread their branches that they were like little trees. There were other  trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look  strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them  and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here  and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and  had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of  themselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did  not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown  branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over  everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had  fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazy  tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had  thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left  all by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other  place she had ever seen in her life.    \"How still it is!\" she whispered. \"How still!\"    Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who  had flown to his tree-top, was still as all the rest. He did not even  flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.    \"No wonder it is still,\" she whispered again. \"I am the first person who  has spoken in here for ten years.\"    She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid  of awakening some one. She was glad that there was grass under her feet  and that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the  fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and  tendrils which formed them.    \"I wonder if they are all quite dead,\" she said. \"Is it all a quite dead  garden? I wish it wasn't.\"    If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood  was alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only  gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a  tiny leaf-bud anywhere.    But she was _inside_ the wonderful garden and she could come through the  door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all  her own.    The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky  over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant  and soft than it was over the moor. The robin flew down from his  tree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another. He  chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing her  things. Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds  of miles away from any one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all.  All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses  were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves  and buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to be a quite  dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would  be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!    Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she  had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole  garden, stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to have  been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were  alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns  in them.    As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping. There  had once been a flower-bed in it, and she thought she saw something  sticking out of the black earth--some sharp little pale green points.  She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look  at them.    \"Yes, they are tiny growing things and they _might_ be crocuses or  snowdrops or daffodils,\" she whispered.    She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp  earth. She liked it very much.    \"Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,\" she said.  \"I will go all over the garden and look.\"    She did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on the  ground. She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after  she had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many  more sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited again.    \"It isn't a quite dead garden,\" she cried out softly to herself. \"Even  if the roses are dead, there are other things alive.\"    She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick  in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way  through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow.  She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and  knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made  nice little clear places around them.    \"Now they look as if they could breathe,\" she said, after she had  finished with the first ones. \"I am going to do ever so many more. I'll  do all I can see. If I haven't time to-day I can come to-morrow.\"    She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so  immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under  the trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat  off, and then her hat, and without knowing it "]]]
