[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#12)"],[1," the happiest man in the  world (Herodotus, I. 30-33).    P. 24, ll. 551 ff., Herald's second speech.]--The connexion of thought is:  \"After all, why should either of us wish to die? All has ended well.\" This  vivid description of the actualities of war can be better appreciated now  than it could in 1913.    P. 25, l. 577, These spoils.]--Spoils purporting to come from the Trojan  War were extant in Greek temples in Aeschylus' day and later.    P. 26, l. 595, Our women's joy-cry.]--There seems to have been in Argos an  old popular festival, celebrating with joy or mockery the supposed death  of a man and a woman. Homer (Od. iii. 309 f.) derives it from a rejoicing  by Orestes over Aigisthos and Clytemnestra; cf. below, ll. 1316 ff., p.  59; Aeschylus here and Sophocles in the _Electra_, from a celebration by  Clytemnestra of the deaths of Agamemnon and Cassandra. Probably it was  really some ordinary New Year and Old Year celebration to which the poets  give a tragic touch. It seems to have had a woman's \"Ololugmos\" in it,  perhaps uttered by men. See Kaibel's note, Soph. _Electra_ 277-281.    P. 26, l. 612, Bronze be dyed like wool.]--Impossible in the literal  sense, but there is after all a way of dying a sword red!    P. 27, l. 617, Menelaus.]--This digression about Menelaus is due, as  similar digressions generally are when they occur in Greek plays, to the  poet feeling bound to follow the tradition. Homer begins his longest  account of the slaying of Agamemnon by asking \"Where was Menelaus?\" (Od.  iii. 249). Agamemnon could be safely attacked because he was alone.  Menelaus was away, wrecked or wind-bound.    P. 28, l. 642, Two-fold scourge.]--Ares works his will when spear crosses  spear, when man meets man. Hence \"two-fold.\"    P. 29, CHORUS. The name HELENA.]--There was a controversy in Aeschylus'  day whether language, including names, was a matter of Convention or of  Nature. Was it mere accident, and could you change the name of anything at  will? Or was language a thing rooted in nature and fixed by God from of  old? Aeschylus adopts the latter view: Why was this being called Helena?  If one had understood God's purpose one would have seen it was because she  really _was_ \"Helenas\"--_Ship-destroyer_. (The Herald's story of the  shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) Similarly, if a hero was  called Aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called  from 'Aiai,' \"Alas!\"--The antistrophe seems to find a meaning in the name  Paris or Alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear.    Pp. 33 ff.]--Entrance of Agamemnon. The metre of the Chorus indicates  marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across  the orchestra and get into position. Cassandra would be dressed, as a  prophetess, in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an  _agrenon_, or net of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and  certain fillets or crowns. The Leader welcomes the King: he explains that,  though he was against the war ten years ago, and has not changed his  opinion, he is a faithful servant of the King ... and that not all are  equally so. He gave a similar hint to the Herald above, ll. 546-550, p.  24.    P. 35, Agamemnon.]--A hard, cold speech, full of pride in the earlier  part, and turning to ominous threats at the end. Those who have dared to  be false shall be broken.--At the end comes a note of fear, like the fear  in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He is so full of triumph and success; he  must be very careful not to provoke a fall.--Victory, Nike, was to the  Greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. It clung to you or it deserted  you. And one who was really charged with Victory, like Agamemnon, was very  valuable to his friends and people. Hence they made statues of Victory  wingless--so that she should not fly away. See _Four Stages of Greek  Religion_, p. 138 note.    P. 36, Clytemnestra.]--A wonderful speech. It seems to me that Aeschylus'  imagination realized all the confused passions in Clytemnestra's mind, but  that his art was not yet sufficiently developed to make them all clear and  explicit. She is in suspense; does Agamemnon know her guilt or not? At  least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to justify or excuse  herself in the eyes of the world. A touch of hysteria creeps in; why could  he not have been killed in all these years? Why must he rise, like some  monster from the grave, unkillable? Gradually she recovers her calm,  explains clearly the suspicious point of Orestes' absence, and heaps up  her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which  Agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39). Again, at the end, when she finds  that for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.    P. 38.]--What is the motive of the Crimson Tapestries? I think the  tangling robe must have been in the tradition, as the murder in the bath  certainly was. One motive, of course, is obvious: Clytemnestra is tempting  Agamemnon to sin or \"go too far.\" He tries to resist, but the splendour of  an oriental homecoming seduces him and he yields. But is that enough to  account for such a curious trait in the story, and one so strongly  emphasized? We are told afterwards that Clytemnestra threw over her victim  an \"endless web,\" long and rich (p. 63), to prevent his seeing or using  his arms. And I cannot help suspecting that this endless web was the same  as the crimson pall.    If one tries to conjecture the origin of this curious story, it is perhaps  a clue to realize that the word _droite_ means both a bath and a  sarcophagus, or rather that the thing called droite, a narrow stone or  marble vessel about seven feet long, was in pre-classical and  post-classical times used as a sarcophagus, but in classical times chiefly  or solely as a bath. If among the prehistoric graves at Mycenae some later  peasants discovered a royal mummy or skeleton in a sarcophagus, wrapped in  a robe of royal crimson, and showing signs of violent death--such as  Schliemann believed that he discovered--would they not say: \"We found the  body of a King murdered in a bath, and wrapped round and round in a great  robe?\"    P. 39 f.]--Agamemnon is going through the process of temptation. He  protests rather too often and yields.    P. 39, l. 931, Tell me but this.]--This little dialogue is very  characteristic of Aeschylus. Euripides would have done it at three times  the length and made all the points clear. In Aeschylus the subtlety is  there, but it is not easy to follow.    P. 40, l. 945, These bound slaves.]--i.e. his shoes. The metaphor shows  the trend of his unconscious mind.    P. 41, l. 950, This princess.]--This is the first time that the attention  of the audience is drawn to Cassandra. She too is one of Aeschylus' silent  figures. I imagine her pale, staring in front of her, almost as if in a  trance, until terror seizes her at Clytemnestra's greeting in l. 1035, p.  45.    P. 41, l. 964, The cry.]--i.e. the cry of the possessed prophetess which  rang from the inner sanctuary at Delphi and was interpreted by the  priests.--The last two lines of the speech are plain in their meaning but  hard to translate. Literally: \"when the full, or fulfilled, man walketh  his home,--O Zeus the Fulfiller, fulfil my prayers.\"    P. 42, l. 976.]--The victim has been drawn into the house; the Chorus sing  a low boding song: every audience at a Greek tragedy would expect next to  hear a death cry from within, or to see a horrified messenger rush out.  Instead of which the door opens and there is Clytemnestra: what does she  want? \"Come thou also!\" One victim is not enough.--In the next scene we  must understand the cause of Clytemnestra's impatience. If she stays too  long outside, some one will warn Agamemnon; if she leaves Cassandra, she  with her second sight will warn the Chorus. If Cassandra could only be got  inside all would be safe!    P. 44, l. 1022, \"One there was of old.\"]--Asklepios, the physician,  restored Hippolytus to life, and Zeus blasted him for so oversetting the  laws of nature.    P. 45, l. 1040, Alcmena's son.]--Heracles was made a slave to Omphale,  Queen of Lydia. His grumbles at his insufficient food were a theme of  comedy.    P. 45, l. 1049, Belike thou canst not yet.]--Cf. below, ll. 1066 ff. The  Elder speaks in sympathy. \"Very likely you cannot yet bring yourself to  submit.\"    P. 46, l. 1061, Thou show her.]--It seems odd to think that this passage  has for centuries been translated as if it was all addressed to Cassandra:  \"But if you do not understand what I say, please indicate the same with  your barbarous hand!\"--What makes Cassandra at last speak? I think that  the Elder probably touches her, and the touch as it were breaks the spell.    P. 47, l. 1072, Cassandra.]--\"Otototoi\" really takes the place of a stage  direction: she utters a long low sob.--The exclamation which I have  translated \"Dreams!\" seems to occur when people see ghosts or visions.  _Alcestis_, 261; _Prometheus_, 567. Cf. _Phoenissae_ 1296.--\"Mine enemy!\"  The name \"Apollon\" suggested \"_apollyon,\"_ Destroying ... the form which  is actually used in the Book of Revelation (Rev. ix. 11).    Observe how, during the lyric scene, Cassandra's vision grows steadily  more definite: First vague horror of the House: then the sobbing of  children, slain long ago: then, a new deed of blood coming; a woman in it:  a wife: then, with a great effort, an attempt to describe the actual  slaying in the bath. Lastly, the sight of herself among the slain. (This  last point is greatly developed by Euripides, _Trojan Women_, ll. 445 ff.,  pp. 33 f.).    The story of the Children of Thyestes is given below, ll. 1590 ff., p. 73.  Procne (or Philomela) was an Attic princess who, in fury against her  Thracian husband, Tereus, killed their child Itys, or Itylus, and was  changed into a nightingale, to weep for him for ever.

During"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14426"],[0,"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (#12)"],[1,"who were brothers, English by race,  Afrikanders by birth, Boers by choice, I had some conversation. The war,  they said, was going well. Of course, it was a great matter to face the  power and might of the British Empire, still they were resolved. They  would drive the English out of South Africa for ever, or else fight to  the last man. I said:    'You attempt the impossible. Pretoria will be taken by the middle of  March. What hope have you of withstanding a hundred thousand soldiers?'    'If I thought,' said the younger of the two brothers vehemently, 'that  the Dutchmen would give in because Pretoria was taken, I would smash my  rifle on those metals this very moment. We will fight for ever.' I could  only reply:    'Wait and see how you feel when the tide is running the other way. It  does not seem so easy to die when death is near.'    The man said, 'I will wait.'    Then we made friends. I told him that I hoped he would come safely  through the war, and live to see a happier and a nobler South Africa  under the flag which had been good enough for his forefathers; and he  took off his blanket--which he was wearing with a hole in the middle  like a cloak--and gave it to me to sleep in. So we parted, and  presently, as night fell, the Field Cornet who had us in charge bade us  carry a little forage into the shed to sleep on, and then locked us up  in the dark, soldiers, sailors, officers, and Correspondent--a  broken-spirited jumble.    I could not sleep. Vexation of spirit, a cold night, and wet clothes  withheld sweet oblivion. The rights and wrongs of the quarrel, the  fortunes and chances of the war, forced themselves on the mind. What men  they were, these Boers! I thought of them as I had seen them in the  morning riding forward through the rain--thousands of independent  riflemen, thinking for themselves, possessed of beautiful weapons, led  with skill, living as they rode without commissariat or transport or  ammunition column, moving like the wind, and supported by iron  constitutions and a stern, hard Old Testament God who should surely  smite the Amalekites hip and thigh. And then, above the rain storm that  beat loudly on the corrugated iron, I heard the sound of a chaunt. The  Boers were singing their evening psalm, and the menacing notes--more  full of indignant war than love and mercy--struck a chill into my heart,  so that I thought after all that the war was unjust, that the Boers were  better men than we, that Heaven was against us, that Ladysmith,  Mafeking, and Kimberley would fall, that the Estcourt garrison would  perish, that foreign Powers would intervene, that we should lose South  Africa, and that would be the beginning of the end. So for the time I  despaired of the Empire, nor was it till the morning sun--all the  brighter after the rain storms, all the warmer after the chills--struck  in through the windows that things reassumed their true colours and  proportions.          CHAPTER IX    THROUGH THE DUTCH CAMPS      Pretoria: November 30, 1899.    The bitter wind of disappointment pierces even the cloak of sleep.  Moreover, the night was cold and the wet clothes chilled and stiffened  my limbs, provoking restless and satisfactory dreams. I was breakfasting  with President Kruger and General Joubert. 'Have some jam,' said the  President. 'Thanks,' I replied, 'I would rather have marmalade.' But  there was none. Their evident embarrassment communicated itself to me.  'Never mind,' I said, 'I'd just as soon have jam.' But the President was  deeply moved. 'No, no,' he cried; 'we are not barbarians. Whatever you  are entitled to you shall have, if I have to send to Johannesburg for  it.' So he got up to ring the bell, and with the clang I woke.    The first light of dawn was just peering in through the skylight of the  corrugated iron shed. The soldiers lay in a brown litter about the  floor, several snoring horribly. The meaning of it came home with a  slap. Imprisoned; not able to come and go at will; about to be dragged  off and put in some secluded place while others fought the great quarrel  to the end; out of it all--like a pawn taken early in the game and flung  aside into the box. I groaned with vexation, and, sitting up, aroused  Frankland, who shared my blanket. Then the Boers unlocked the doors and  ordered us to get ready to march at once.    The forage which we had spread on the floor rustled, and the first idea  of escape crossed my mind. Why not lie buried underneath this litter  until prisoners and escort had marched away together? Would they count?  Would they notice? I did not think so. They would reason--we know they  all went in; it is certain none could have escaped during the night:  therefore all must be here this morning. Suppose they missed me? 'Where  is the \"reporter,\" with whom we talked last evening?' Haldane would  reply that he must have slipped out of the door before it was shut. They  might scour the country; but would they search the shed? It seemed most  unlikely. The scheme pleased my fancy exceedingly, and I was just  resolving to conceal myself, when one of the guards entered and ordered  everyone to file out forthwith.    We chewed a little more of the ox, slain and toasted the night before,  and drank some rainwater from a large puddle, and, after this frugal  breakfast, intimated that we were ready. Then we set out--a sorry gang  of dirty, tramping prisoners, but yesterday the soldiers of the Queen;  while the fierce old farmers cantered their ponies about the veldt or  closed around the column, looking at us from time to time with  irritating disdain and still more irritating pity. We marched across the  waggon bridge of the Tugela, and following the road, soon entered the  hills. Among these we journeyed for several hours, wading across the  gullies which the heavy rains had turned into considerable streams and  persecuted by the slanting rays of the sun. Here and there parties of  Boers met us, and much handshaking and patting on the back ensued  between the newcomers and our escort. Once we halted at a little field  hospital--a dozen tents and waggons with enormous red-cross flags,  tucked away in a deep hollow.    We passed through Pieters without a check at the same toilsome plod and  on to Nelthorpe. Here we began to approach the Dutch lines of investment  round Ladysmith, and the advance of half an hour brought us to a very  strong picket, where we were ordered to halt and rest. Nearly two  hundred Boers swarmed round in a circle and began at once--for they are  all keen politicians and as curious as children--to ask questions of  every sort. What did we think of South Africa? Would we like to go in an  armoured train again? How long would the English go on fighting? When  would the war end? and the reply, 'When you are beaten,' was received  with shouts of laughter.    'Oh no, old chappie, you can never beat us. Look at Mafeking. We have  taken Mafeking. You will find Baden Powell waiting for you at Pretoria.  Kimberley, too, will fall this week. Rhodes is trying to escape in a  balloon, disguised as a woman--a fine woman.' Great merriment at this.  'What about Ladysmith?' 'Ten days. Ten days more and then we shall have  some whisky.' Listen. There was the boom of a heavy gun, and, turning, I  saw the white cloud of smoke hanging on the crest of Bulwana.    'That goes on always,' said the Boer. 'Can any soldiers bear that long?  Oh, you will find all the English army at Pretoria. Indeed, if it were  not for the sea-sickness we would take England. Besides, do you think  the European Powers will allow you to bully us?'    I said, 'Why bully if you are so strong?'    'Well, why should you come and invade our country?'    'Your country? I thought this was Natal.'    'So it is: but Natal is ours. You stole it from us. Now we take it back  again. That's all.'    A hum of approval ran round the grinning circle. An old Boer came up. He  did not understand what induced the soldiers to go in the armoured  train. Frankland replied, 'Ordered to. Don't you have to obey your  orders?'    The old man shook his head in bewilderment, then he observed, 'I fight  to kill: I do not fight to be killed. If the Field Cornet was to order  me to go in an armoured train, I would say to him, \"Field Cornet, go to  hell.\"'    'Ah, you are not soldiers.'    'But we catch soldiers and kill soldiers and make soldiers run away.'    There was a general chorus of 'Yaw, yaw, yaw,' and grunts of amusement.    'You English,' said a well-dressed man, 'die for your country: we  Afrikanders live for ours.'    I said, 'Surely you don't think you will win this war?'    'Oh, yes; we will win all right this time, just the same as before.'    'But it is not the same as before. Gladstone is dead, they are  determined at home. If necessary they will send three hundred thousand  men and spend a hundred millions.'    'We are not afraid; no matter how many thousand penny soldiers you  send,' and an English Boer added, 'Let 'em all come.'    But there was one discordant note in the full chorus of confidence. It  recurred again and again. 'Where is Buller?' 'When is Buller coming?'  These merry fellows were not without their doubts.    'He will come when the army is ready.'    'But we have beaten the army.'    'No, the war has not begun yet.'    'It's all over for you, old chappie, anyway.'    It was a fair hit. I joined the general laughter, and, reviewing the  incident by the light of subsequent events, feel I had some right to.    Very soon after this we were ordered to march again, and we began to  move to the eastward in the direction of the Bulwana Hill, descending as  we did so into the valley of the Klip River. The report of the  intermittent guns engaged in the bombardment of Ladysmith seemed very  loud and near, and the sound of the British artillery making occasional  reply could be plainly distinguished.
