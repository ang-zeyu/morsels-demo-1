It is a sort of _soprano  leggiero_ with a small range of superficial feelings. It can  sentimentalize, and, as Dryden says, be \"soft, complaining,\" but when  we hear it pour forth a veritable ecstasy of jubilation, as it does in  the dramatic climax of Beethoven's overture \"Leonore No. 3,\" we marvel  at the transformation effected by the composer. Advantage has also  been taken of the difference between its high and low tones, and now  in some romantic music, as in Raff's \"Lenore\" symphony, or the prayer  of _Agathe_ in \"Der Freischuetz,\" the hollowness of the low tones  produces a mysterious effect that is exceedingly striking. Still the  fact remains that the native voice of the instrument, though sweet,  is expressionless compared with that of the oboe or clarinet. Modern  composers sometimes write for three flutes; but in the older writers,  when a third flute is used, it is generally an octave flute, or  piccolo flute (Plate III.)--a tiny instrument whose aggressiveness of  voice is out of all proportion to its diminutiveness of body. This is  the instrument which shrieks and whistles when the band is playing at  storm-making, to imitate the noise of the wind. It sounds an octave  higher than is indicated by the notes in its part, and so is what is  called a transposing instrument of four-foot tone. It revels in  military music, which is proper, for it is an own cousin to the  ear-piercing fife, which annually makes up for its long silence in the  noisy days before political elections. When you hear a composition in  march time, with bass and snare drum, cymbals and triangle, such as  the Germans call \"Turkish\" or \"Janizary\" music, you may be sure to  hear also the piccolo flute. The flute is doubtless one of the oldest  instruments in the world. The primitive cave-dwellers made flutes of  the leg-bones of birds and other animals, an origin of which a record  is preserved in the Latin name _tibia_. The first wooden flutes were  doubtless the Pandean pipes, in which the tone was produced by blowing  across the open ends of hollow reeds. The present method, already  known to the ancient Egyptians, of closing the upper end, and creating  the tone by blowing across a hole cut in the side, is only a  modification of the method pursued, according to classic tradition, by  Pan when he breathed out his dejection at the loss of the nymph  Syrinx, by blowing across the tuneful reeds which were that nymph in  her metamorphosed state.    [Sidenote: _Reed instruments._]    [Sidenote: _Double reeds._]    The flute or pipe of the Greeks and Romans was only distantly related  to the true flute, but was the ancestor of its orchestral companions,  the oboe and clarinet. These instruments are sounded by being blown in  at the end, and the tone is created by vibrating reeds, whereas in the  flute it is the result of the impinging of the air on the edge of the  hole called the embouchure, and the consequent stirring of the column  of air in the flue of the instrument. The reeds are thin slips or  blades of cane. The size and bore of the instruments and the  difference between these reeds are the causes of the differences in  tone quality between these relatives. The oboe or hautboy, English  horn, and the bassoon have what are called double reeds. Two narrow  blades of cane are fitted closely together, and fastened with silk on  a small metal tube extending from the upper end of the instrument in  the case of the oboe and English horn, from the side in the case of  the bassoon. The reeds are pinched more or less tightly between the  lips, and are set to vibrating by the breath.    [Sidenote: _The oboe._]    [Sidenote: _The English horn._]    The oboe (Plate IV.) is naturally associated with music of a pastoral  character. It is pre-eminently a melody instrument, and though its  voice comes forth shrinkingly, its uniqueness of tone makes it easily  heard. It is a most lovable instrument. \"Candor, artless grace, soft  joy, or the grief of a fragile being suits the oboe's accents,\" says  Berlioz. The peculiarity of its mouth-piece gives its tone a reedy or  vibrating quality totally unlike the clarinet's. Its natural alto is  the English horn (Plate V.), which is an oboe of larger growth, with  curved tube for convenience of manipulation. The tone of the English  horn is fuller, nobler, and is very attractive in melancholy or dreamy  music. There are few players on the English horn in this country, and  it might be set down as a rule that outside of New York, Boston, and  Chicago, the English horn parts are played by the oboe in America. No  melody displays the true character of the English horn better than the  _Ranz des Vaches_ in the overture to Rossini's \"William Tell\"--that  lovely Alpine song which the flute embroiders with exquisite ornament.  One of the noblest utterances of the oboe is the melody of the funeral  march in Beethoven's \"Heroic\" symphony, in which its tenderness has  beautiful play. It is sometimes used effectively in imitative music.  In Haydn's \"Seasons,\" and also in that grotesque tone poem by  Saint-Saens, the \"Danse Macabre,\" it gives the cock crow. It is the  timid oboe that sounds the A for the orchestra to tune by.    [Sidenote: _The bassoon._]    [Sidenote: _An orchestral humorist._]    [Sidenote: _Supernatural effects._]    The grave voice of the oboe is heard from the bassoon (Plate VI.),  where, without becoming assertive, it gains a quality entirely unknown  to the oboe and English horn. It is this quality that makes the  bassoon the humorist _par excellence_ of the orchestra. It is a reedy  bass, very apt to recall to those who have had a country education the  squalling tone of the homely instrument which the farmer's boy  fashions out of the stems of the pumpkin-vine. The humor of the  bassoon is an unconscious humor, and results from the use made of its  abysmally solemn voice. This solemnity in quality is paired with  astonishing flexibility of utterance, so that its gambols are always  grotesque. Brahms permits the bassoon to intone the _Fuchslied_ of the  German students in his \"Academic\" overture. Beethoven achieves a  decidedly comical effect by a stubborn reiteration of key-note, fifth,  and octave by the bassoon under a rustic dance intoned by the oboe in  the scherzo of his \"Pastoral\" symphony; and nearly every modern  composer has taken advantage of the instrument's grotesqueness.  Mendelssohn introduces the clowns in his \"Midsummer-Night's-Dream\"  music by a droll dance for two bassoons over a sustained bass note  from the violoncellos; but when Meyerbeer wanted a very different  effect, a ghastly one indeed, in the scene of the resuscitation of the  nuns in his \"Robert le Diable,\" he got it by taking two bassoons as  solo instruments and using their weak middle tones, which, Berlioz  says, have \"a pale, cold, cadaverous sound.\" Singularly enough, Handel  resorted to a similar device in his \"Saul,\" to accompany the vision of  the Witch of Endor.    [Sidenote: _The double bassoon._]    In all these cases a great deal depends upon the relation between the  character of the melody and the nature of the instrument to which it  is set. A swelling martial fanfare may be made absurd by changing it  from trumpets to a weak-voiced wood-wind. It is only the string  quartet that speaks all the musical languages of passion and emotion.  The double-bassoon is so large an instrument that it has to be bent on  itself to bring it under the control of the player. It sounds an  octave lower than the written notes. It is not brought often into the  orchestra, but speaks very much to the purpose in Brahms's beautiful  variations on a theme by Haydn, and the glorious finale of Beethoven's  Fifth Symphony.    [Sidenote: _The clarinet._]    [Sidenote: _The bass clarinet._]    The clarinet (Plate VII.) is the most eloquent member of the wood-wind  choir, and, except some of its own modifications or the modifications  of the oboe and bassoon, the latest arrival in the harmonious company.  It is only a little more than a century old. It has the widest range  of expression of the wood-winds, and its chief structural difference  is in its mouth-piece. It has a single flat reed, which is much wider  than that of the oboe or bassoon, and is fastened by a metallic band  and screw to the flattened side of the mouth-piece, whose other side  is cut down, chisel shape, for convenience. Its voice is rich, mellow,  less reedy, and much fuller and more limpid than the voice of the  oboe, which Berlioz tries to describe by analogy as \"sweet-sour.\" It  is very flexible, too, and has a range of over three and a half  octaves. Its high tones are sometimes shrieky, however, and the full  beauty of the instrument is only disclosed when it sings in the middle  register. Every symphony and overture contains passages for the  clarinet which serve to display its characteristics. Clarinets are  made of different sizes for different keys, the smallest being that in  E-flat, with an unpleasantly piercing tone, whose use is confined to  military bands. There is also an alto clarinet and a bass clarinet  (Plate VIII.). The bell of the latter instrument is bent upward, pipe  fashion, and its voice is peculiarly impressive and noble. It is a  favorite solo instrument in Liszt's symphonic poems.    [Sidenote: _Lips and reeds._]    [Sidenote: _The brass instruments._]    [Sidenote: _Improvements in brass instruments._]    [Sidenote: _Valves and slides._]    The fundamental principle of the instruments last described is the  production of tone by vibrating reeds. In the instruments of the brass  choir, the duty of the reeds is performed by the lips of the player.  Variety of tone in respect of quality is produced by variations in  size, shape, and modifications in parts like the bell and mouth-piece.

Thus it is vain for you to have come from  Mechlin or Brussels, to have seen the _Magi_ and the _Calvary_, to have  formed an exact and measured idea of Rubens, or even to have taken  familiarities in examining him that have set you at your ease with him,  for you cannot enter Notre Dame as you enter a museum.    It is three o'clock; the clock high up has just struck. Scarcely even a  sacristan makes a sound in the tranquil, clean and clear naves, as  Pieter Neefs has represented them, with an inimitable feeling for their  solitude and grandeur. It is raining and the light is fading. Shadows  and gleams succeed each other upon the two triptychs in their thin  framing of brown wood fastened without any pomp to the cold and smooth  walls of the transepts, and this proud painting only stands out the more  amid the violent lights and obscurities contending around it. German  copyists have placed their easels before the _Descent from the Cross_;  there is nobody before the _Elevation to the Cross_. This simple fact  expresses the world's opinion as to these two works.    They are greatly admired, almost unreservedly so, and the fact is rare  in the case of Rubens, but the admiration is divided. The chief renown  has fallen upon the _Descent from the Cross_. The _Elevation to the  Cross_ has the gift of touching still more the impassioned, or more  deeply convinced, friends of Rubens. No two works, in fact, could  resemble each other less than these that were conceived at an interval  of two years, that were inspired by the same effort of mind, and that,  nevertheless, so plainly bear the marks of two separate tendencies. The  date of the _Descent from the Cross_ is 1612; that of the _Elevation to  the Cross_ is 1610. I insist upon the date, for it is important. Rubens  was returning to Antwerp, and it was on his disembarkation, so to speak,  that he painted them. His education was finished. At that moment he had  even an excess of studies that were somewhat heavy for him and of which  he was going to make free use once for all and then get rid of almost  immediately. Of all the Italian masters he had consulted, each one, be  it understood, gave him advice of a sufficiently exclusive nature. The  hot-headed masters authorized him to dare greatly; the severe masters  recommended him to keep himself under strong restraint.    His nature, character, and native faculties all tended to a division.  The task itself exacted that he should make two parts of his beautiful  gifts. He felt the expediency of this, took advantage of it, treated of  the subjects in accordance with their spirit, and gave two contrary and  two just ideas of himself: on the one hand the most magnificent example  we possess of his wisdom, and on the other one of the most astonishing  visions of his fire and ardour. To the personal inspiration of the  painter add a very marked Italian influence and you will still better be  able to explain to yourself the extraordinary value that posterity  attaches to pages which may be regarded as his diploma works and which  were the first public acts of his life as the head of a school.    I will tell you how this influence manifests itself and by what  characteristics it may be recognized. But first it is enough for me to  remark that it exists, in order that the physiognomy of the talent of  Rubens may not lose any of its features at the moment when we examine  it. This is not that he should be positively cramped in canonical  formulae in which others would find themselves imprisoned.    On the other hand, with what ease he moves among these formulae, with  what freedom he makes use of them, with what tact he disguises or  confesses them, according as he takes pleasure in revealing the  well-informed man or the novice. However, whatever he may do, we feel  the _Romanist_ who has just spent some years on classic ground, who has  just arrived and has not yet changed his atmosphere. There is some  unknown quality remaining with him that reveals travel, such as a  foreign odour about his clothes. It is certainly to this fine Italian  scent that the _Descent from the Cross_ owes the extreme favour that it  enjoys. For those indeed who would like Rubens to be somewhat as he is,  but very much also as they imagine him, there is here a seriousness in  youth, a frank and studious flower of maturity which is about to  disappear and which is unique.    I need not describe the composition. You could not mention a more  popular composition as a work of art or as an example of religious  style. There is nobody who has not in his mind the ordering and the  effect of the picture, its great central light cast against a dark  background, its grandiose masses, its distinct and massive divisions. We  know that Rubens got the first idea of it from Italy, and that he made  no attempt to conceal the loan. The scene is powerful and grave. It acts  on one from afar, it stands out strikingly upon a wall: it is serious  and enforces seriousness. When we remember the carnage with which the  work of Rubens is crimsoned, the massacres, the executioners torturing,  martyring, and making their victims howl, we recognize that here we have  a noble _execution_. Everything in it is restrained, concise, and  laconic, as in a page of Holy Writ.    There are neither gesticulations, cries, horrors, nor too many tears.  The Virgin hardly breaks into a single sob, and the intense suffering of  the drama is expressed by scarce a gesture of inconsolable motherhood, a  tearful face, or red eyes. The Christ is one of the most elegant figures  that Rubens ever imagined for the painting of a God. It possesses some  peculiar extended, pliant, and almost tapering grace, that gives it  every natural delicacy and all the distinction of a beautiful academic  study. It is subtly proportioned and in perfect taste: the drawing does  not fall far short of the sentiment.    You have not forgotten the effect of that large and slightly hip-shot  body, with its small, thin, and fine head slightly fallen to one side,  so livid and so perfectly limpid in its pallor, neither shrivelled nor  drawn, and from which all suffering has disappeared, as it descends  with so much beatitude to rest for a moment among the strange beauties  of the death of the just! Recollect how heavily it hangs and how  precious it is to support, in what a lifeless attitude it glides along  the sudarium, with what agonized affection it is received by the  outstretched hands and arms of the women. Is there anything more  touching? One of his feet, livid and pierced, encounters at the foot of  the Cross the bare shoulder of Magdalen. It does not rest upon it, but  grazes it. The contact is scarcely noticeable, we divine it rather than  see it. It would have been profane to insist upon it, it would have been  cruel not to have made us believe in it. All Rubens's furtive  sensitiveness is in this imperceptible contact that says so many things,  respects them all, and makes them affecting.    The sinner is admirable. She is incontestably the best piece of work in  the picture, the most delicate, the most personal, one of the best  figures of women, moreover, that Rubens ever executed in his career that  was so fertile in feminine creations. This delicious figure has its  legend; how should it not have, its very perfection having become  legendary! It is probable that this beautiful maiden with the black  eyes, with the firm glance, with the clear-cut profile, is a portrait,  and the portrait is that of Isabella Brandt, whom he had married two  years before, and who had also sat for him for the Virgin in the wing of  the _Visitation_. However, while observing her ample figure, powdered  hair, and plump proportions, we reflect what must some day be the  splendid and individual charms of that beautiful Helen Fourment whom he  is to marry twenty years later.    From his earliest to his latest years, one tenacious type seems to have  taken up its abode in Rubens's heart; one fixed idea haunted his amorous  and constant imagination. He delights in it, he completes it, he  achieves it; to some extent he pursues it in his two marriages, just as  he never ceases to repeat it throughout his works. There is always  something both of Isabella and of Helen in the women whom Rubens painted  from either one of them. In the first he puts a sort of preconceived  trait of the second; into the second glides a kind of ineffaceable  memory of the first. At the date of which we treat, he possesses the  first and is inspired by her; the other is not yet born, and still he  divines her. The future already mingles with the present; the real with  the ideal. As soon as the image appears it has this double form. Not  only is it exquisite, but not a feature is wanting. Does it not seem as  if in thus fixing it from the first day, Rubens intended that neither he  nor anyone else should forget it?    As for the rest, this is the sole mundane grace with which he has  embellished this austere picture, slightly monkish, and absolutely  evangelical in character, if by that is meant the gravity of sentiment  and style, and if we remember the rigours that such a spirit must impose  upon itself. In that case, you will understand, a great part of his  reserve is as much the result of his Italian education as of the  attention he gave to his subject.    The canvas is sombre, notwithstanding its high lights and the  extraordinary whiteness of the winding-sheet. In spite of its reliefs,  the painting is _flat_. It is a picture of blackish grounds on which are  disposed broad strong lights of no gradations. The colouring is not  very rich: it is full, well-sustained, and clearly calculated to be  effective from a distance. It makes the picture, frames it, expresses  its weakness and its strength, and makes no attempt to beautify it. It  is composed of an almost black green, an absolute black, a rather heavy"]]]
