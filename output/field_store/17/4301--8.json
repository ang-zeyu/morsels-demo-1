XIII    WHY BUSTER BEAR APPEARS TO HAVE NO TAIL      Peter Rabbit had something new to bother his bump of curiosity. And it  did bother it a lot. He had just seen Buster Bear for the first time,  and what do you think had impressed him most? Well, it wasn't Buster's  great size, or wonderful strength, or big claws, or deep,  grumbly-rumbly voice. No, Sir, it wasn't one of these. It was the fact  that Buster Bear seemed to have no tail! Peter couldn't get over that.  He almost pitied Buster Bear. You see, Peter has a great admiration  for fine tails. He has always been rather ashamed of the funny little  one he has himself. Still, it is a real tail, and he has often  comforted himself with that thought.    So the first thing Peter did when he saw Buster Bear was to look to  see what kind of a tail he had. Just imagine how surprised he was when  he couldn't make sure that Buster had any tail at all. There was  something that might, just might, be meant for a tail, and Peter  wasn't even sure of that. If it was, it was so ridiculously small that  Peter felt that he had no reason to be ashamed of his own tail.    He was still thinking about this when he started for home. Half way  there, he paused, saw that the way to the Smiling Pool was clear, and  suddenly made up his mind to ask Grandfather Frog about Buster Bear's  tail. Off he started, lipperty-lipperty-lip.    \"Oh, Grandfather Frog,\" he panted, as soon as he reached the edge of  the Smiling Pool, \"has Buster Bear got a tail?\"    Grandfather Frog regarded Peter in silence for a minute or two.    Then very slowly he asked: \"What are your eyes for, Peter Rabbit?  Couldn't you see whether or not he has a tail?\"    \"No, Grandfather Frog. I really couldn't tell whether he has a tail or  not,\" replied Peter quite truthfully. \"At first I thought he hadn't,  and then I thought he might have. If he has, it doesn't seem to me  that it is enough to call a really truly tail.\"    \"Well, it is a really truly tail, even if you don't think so,\"  retorted Grandfather Frog, \"and he has it for a reminder.\"    \"A reminder!\" exclaimed Peter, looking very much puzzled. \"A reminder  of what?\"    Grandfather Frog cleared his throat two or three times. \"Sit down,  Peter, and learn a lesson from the tale of the tail of Old King Bear,\"  said he very seriously.    \"You remember that once upon a time, long ago, when the world was  young, Old King Bear ruled in the Green Forest, and everybody brought  tribute to him.\"    Peter nodded and Grandfather Frog went on.    \"Now Old King Bear was the great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of  Buster Bear, and he looked very much as Buster does, except that he  didn't have any tail at all, not the least sign of a tail. At first,  before he was made king of the Green Forest, he didn't mind this at  all. In fact, he was rather pleased that he didn't have a tail. You  see, he couldn't think of any earthly use he would have for a tail,  and so he was glad that he hadn't got one to bother with.    \"This was just Old Mother Nature's view of the matter. She had done  her very best to give everybody everything that they really needed,  and not to give them things which they didn't need. She couldn't see  that Mr. Bear had the least need of a tail, and so she hadn't given  him one. Mr. Bear was perfectly happy without one, and was so busy  getting enough to eat that he didn't have time for silly thoughts or  vain wishes.    \"Then he was made king over all the people of the Green Forest, and  his word was law. It was a very great honor, and for a while he felt  it so and did his best to rule wisely. He went about just as before,  hunting for his living, and had no more time than before for foolish  thoughts or vain wishes. But after a little, the little people over  whom he ruled began to bring him tribute, so that he no longer had to  hunt for enough to eat. Indeed, he had so much brought to him, that he  couldn't begin to eat all of it, and he grew very dainty and fussy  about what he did eat. Having nothing to do but eat and sleep, he grew  very fat and lazy, as is the case with most people who have nothing to  do. He grew so fat that when he walked, he puffed and wheezed. He grew  so lazy that he wanted to be waited on all the time.    \"It happened about this time that he overheard Mr. Fox talking to Mr.  Wolf when they both thought him asleep. 'A pretty kind of a king, he  is!' sneered Mr. Fox. 'The idea of a king without a tail!'    \"'That's so,' assented Mr. Wolf. 'Why, even that little upstart, Mr.  Rabbit, has got a make-believe tail.'\"    Grandfather Frog's eyes twinkled as he said this, and Peter looked  very much embarrassed. But he didn't say anything, so Grandfather Frog  went on.    \"Old King Bear pretended to wake up just then, and right away Mr. Fox  and Mr. Wolf were as polite and smiling as you please and began to  flatter him. They told him how proud they were of their king, and how  handsome he was, and a lot of other nice things, all of which he had  heard often before and had believed. He pretended to believe them now,  but after they were through paying their respects and had gone away,  he kept turning over and over in his mind what he had overheard them  say when they thought he was asleep.    \"After that he couldn't think of anything but the fact that he hadn't  any tail. He took particular notice of all who came to pay him  tribute, and he saw that every one of them had a tail. Some had long  tails; some had short tails; some had handsome tails and some had  homely tails; but everybody had a tail of some kind. The more he tried  not to think of these tails, the more he did think of them. The more  he thought of them, the more discontented he grew because he had none.  He didn't stop to think that probably all of them had use for their  tails. No, Sir, he didn't think of that. Everybody else had a tail,  and he hadn't. He felt that it was a disgrace that he, the king,  should have no tail. He brooded over it so much that he lost his  appetite and grew cross and peevish.    \"Then along came Old Mother Nature to see how things were going in the  Green Forest. Of course she saw right away that something was wrong  with Old King Bear. When she asked him what the matter was, he was  ashamed to tell her at first. But after a little he told her that he  wanted a tail; that he could never again be happy unless he had a  tail. She told him that he hadn't the least use in the world for a  tail, and that he wouldn't be any happier if he had one. Nothing that  she could say made any difference--he wanted a tail. Finally she gave  him one.    \"For a few days Old King Bear was perfectly happy. He spent all his  spare time admiring his new tail. He called the attention of all his  subjects to it, and they all told him that it was a very wonderful  tail and was very becoming to him. But it wasn't long before he found  that his new tail was very much in the way. It bothered him when he  walked. It was in the way when he sat down. It was a nuisance when he  climbed a tree. He didn't have a single use for it, and yet he had to  carry it with him wherever he went. Worse still, he overheard little  Mr. Squirrel and Mr. Possum making fun of it. And then he discovered  that the very ones who admired his tail so to his face were laughing  at him and poking fun at him behind his back.    \"And then Old King Bear wished that he _hadn't_ a tail more than ever  he wished that he _did_ have a tail. Again he lost his appetite and  grew cross and peevish, so that no one dared come near him. So matters  went from bad to worse, until once more Old Mother Nature visited the  Green Forest to see how things were. Very humbly Old King Bear went  down on his knees and begged her to take away his tail. At first Old  Mother Nature refused, but he begged so hard and promised so  faithfully never again to be discontented, that finally she relented  and took away his tail, all but just a wee little bit. That she left  as a reminder lest he should forget the lesson he had learned and  should again grow envious.    [Illustration: \"Then Old King Bear wished that he hadn't a tail.\"]    \"And every bear since that long-ago day has carried about with him a  reminder--you can hardly call it a real tail--of the silly, foolish  discontent of Old King Bear,\" concluded Grandfather Frog.    Peter Rabbit scratched one long ear thoughtfully as he replied: \"Thank  you, Grandfather Frog. I think that hereafter I will be quite content  with what I've got and never want things it is not meant that I should  have.\"          XIV    WHY FLITTER THE BAT FLIES AT NIGHT      [Illustration: \"It must be fine to fly,\" thought Peter. \"I wish I could  fly.\"]    Flitter the Bat made Peter Rabbit's head dizzy. Peter couldn't help  watching him. He just had to. It seemed so wonderful that Flitter  could really fly, that whenever he saw him, Peter had to stop and  watch. And then, as he saw Flitter twist and turn, fly high, fly low,  and go round and round, Peter's head would begin to swim and grow  dizzy, and he wondered and wondered how it was that Flitter himself  didn't grow dizzy.    \"It must be fine to fly,\" thought Peter. \"I wish I could fly. If I  could, I wouldn't spend all my time flying around the way Flitter  does. I'd go on long journeys and see the Great World. I'd fly way,  way up in the blue, blue sky, the way Ol' Mistah Buzzard does, where I  could look down and see all that is going on in the Green Forest and  on the Green Meadows. And I'd fly in the daytime, because there is  more going on then. I wonder, now, why it is that Flitter never comes  out until after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun has gone to bed behind the  Purple Hills. I never see him in the daytime, and I don't even know  where he keeps himself. I never thought of it before, but I wonder why  it is that he flies only at night. I believe I'll ask Grandfather Frog "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#12)"],[1,"    caelestia cernere regna,    quam nocte et vulnere tristi    toleraverit aspera mundi.

HYMN FOR THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD        Fountain of life, supernal Fire,      Who didst unite in wondrous wise      The soul that lives, the clay that dies,    And mad'st them Man: eternal Sire,      Both elements Thy will obey,      Thine is the bond that joins the twain,      And, while united they remain,    Spirit and body own Thy sway.      Yet they must one day disunite,      Sunder in death this mortal frame;      Dust to the dust from whence it came,    The spirit to its heavenward flight.      For all created things must wane,      And age must break the bond at last;      The diverse web that Life held fast    Death's fingers shall unweave again.      Yet, gracious God, Thou dost devise      The death of Death for all Thine own;      The path of safety Thou hast shown    Whereby the doomed limbs may rise:      So that, while fragile bonds of earth      Man's noblest essence still enfold,      That part may yet the sceptre hold    Which from pure aether hath its birth.      For if the earthy will hold sway,      By gross desires and aims possessed,      The soul, too, by the weight oppressed,    Follows the body's downward way.      But if she scorn the guilt that mars--      Still mindful of her fiery sphere--      She bears the flesh, her comrade here,    Back to her home beyond the stars.      The lifeless body we restore      To earth, must slumber free from pain      A little while, that it may gain    The spirit's fellowship once more.      The years will pass with rapid pace      Till through these limbs the life shall flow,      And the long-parted spirit go    To seek her olden dwelling-place.      Then shall the body, that hath lain      And turned to dust in slow decay,      On airy wings be borne away    And join its ancient soul again.      Therefore our tenderest care we spend      Upon the grave: and mourners go      With solemn dirge and footstep slow--    Love's last sad tribute to a friend.      With fair white linen we enfold      The dear dead limbs, and richest store      Of Eastern unguents duly pour    Upon the body still and cold.      Why hew the rocky tomb so deep,      Why raise the monument so fair,      Save that the form we cherish there    Is no dead thing, but laid to sleep?      This is the faithful ministry      Of Christian men, who hold it true      That all shall one day live anew    Who now in icy slumber lie.      And he whose pitying hand shall lay      Some friendless outcast 'neath the sod,      E'en to the almighty Son of God    Doth that benignant service pay.      For this same law doth bid us mourn      Man's common fate, when strangers die,      And pay the tribute of a sigh,    As when our kin to rest are borne.      Of holy Tobit ye have read,      (Grave father of a pious son),      Who, though the feast was set, would run    To do his duty by the dead.      Though waiting servants stood around,      From meat and drink he turned away      And girt himself in haste to lay    The bones with weeping in the ground.      Soon Heaven his righteous zeal repays      With rich reward; the eyes long blind      In bitter gall strange virtue find    And open to the sun's clear rays.      Thus hath our Heavenly Father shown      How sharp and bitter is the smart      When sudden on the purblind heart    The Daystar's healing light is thrown.      He taught us, too, that none may gaze      Upon the heavenly demesne      Ere that in darkness and in pain    His feet have trod the world's rough ways.      So unto death itself is given      Strange bliss, when mortal agony      Opens the way that leads on high    And pain is but the path to Heaven.      Thus to a far serener day      Our body from the grave returns;      Eternal life within it burns    That knows nor languor nor decay.      These faces now so pinched and pale,      That marks of lingering sickness show,      Then fairer than the rose shall glow    And bloom with youth that ne'er shall fail.      Ne'er shall crabbed age their beauty dim      With wrinkled brow and tresses grey,      Nor arid leanness eat away    The vigour of the rounded limb.      Racked with his own destroying pains      Shall fell Disease, who now attacks      Our aching frames, his force relax    Fast fettered in a thousand chains:      While from its far celestial throne      The immortal body, victor now,      Shall watch its old tormentor bow    And in eternal tortures groan.      Why do the clamorous mourners wail      In bootless sorrow murmuring?      And why doth grief unreasoning    God's righteous ordinance assail?      Hushed be your voices, ye that mourn;      Ye weeping mothers, dry the tear;      Let none lament for children dear,    For man through Death to Life is born.      So do dry seeds grow green again,      Now dead and buried in the earth,      And rising to a second birth    Clothe as of old the verdant plain.      Take now, O earth, the load we bear,      And cherish in thy gentle breast      This mortal frame we lay to rest,    The poor remains that were so fair.      For they were once the soul's abode,      That by God's breath created came;      And in them, like a living flame,    Christ's precious gift of wisdom glowed.      Guard thou the body we have laid      Within thy care, till He demand      The creature fashioned by His hand    And after His own image made.      The appointed time soon may we see      When God shall all our hopes fulfil,      And thou must render to His will    Unchanged the charge we give to thee.      For though consumed by mould and rust      Man's body slowly fades away,      And years of lingering decay    Leave but a handful of dry dust;      Though wandering winds, that idly fly,      Should his disparted ashes bear      Through all the wide expanse of air,    Man may not perish utterly.      Yet till Thou dost build up again      This mortal structure by Thy hand,      In what far world wilt Thou command    The soul to rest, now free from stain?      In Abraham's bosom it shall dwell      'Mid verdant bowers, as Lazarus lies      Whom Dives sees with longing eyes    From out the far-off fires of hell.      We trust the words our Saviour said      When, victor o'er grim Death, he cried      To him who suffered at His side    \"In Mine own footsteps shalt thou tread.\"      See, open to the faithful soul,      The shining paths of Paradise;      Now may they to that garden rise    Which from mankind the Serpent stole.      Guide him, we pray, to that blest bourn,      Who served Thee truly here below;      May he the bliss of Eden know,    Who strayed in banishment forlorn.      But we will honour our dear dead      With violets and garlands strown,      And o'er the cold and graven stone    Shall fragrant odours still be shed.                             XI. HYMNUS VIII.
