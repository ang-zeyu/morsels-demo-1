Some Rabbiteers monkey with this, lacing it with half a cup of       catsup, making a sort of pink baboon out of what should be a       white monkey.         There is a cult for Crumby Rabbits variations on which extend all       the way to a deep casserole dish called Baked Rabbit and       consisting of alternate layers of stale bread crumbs and       grated-cheese crumbs. This illegitimate three-layer Rabbit is       moistened with eggs beaten up with milk, and seasoned with salt       and paprika.       Crumby Tomato Rabbit    2 teaspoons butter  2 cups grated cheese  1/2 cup soft bread crumbs  1 cup tomato soup  Salt and pepper  1 egg, lightly beaten         Melt cheese in butter, moisten bread crumbs with the tomato soup       and stir in; season, add egg and keep stirring until velvety.       Serve on toasted crackers, as a contrast to the bread crumbs.       Gherkin or Irish Rabbit    2 tablespoons butter  2 cups grated cheese  1/2 cup milk (or beer)  A dash of vinegar  1/2 teaspoon mustard  Salt and pepper  1/2 cup chopped gherkin pickles         Melt cheese in butter, steadily stir in liquid and seasonings.       Keep stirring until smooth, then add the pickles and serve.    This may have been called Irish after the green of the pickle.       Dutch Rabbit         Melt thin slices of any good cooking cheese in a heavy skillet       with a little butter, prepared mustard, and a splash of beer.         Have ready some slices of toast soaked in hot beer or ale and       pour the Rabbit over them.         The temperance version of this substitutes milk for beer and       delicately soaks the toast in hot water instead.    Proof that there is no Anglo-Saxon influence here lies in the use of  prepared mustard. The English, who still do a lot of things the hard  way, mix their biting dry mustard fresh with water before every meal,  while the Germans and French bottle theirs, as we do.       Pumpernickel Rabbit         This German deviation is made exactly the same as the Dutch       Rabbit above, but its ingredients are the opposite in color.       Black bread (pumpernickel) slices are soaked in heated dark beer       (porter or stout) and the yellow cheese melted in the skillet is       also stirred up with brunette beer.    Since beer is a kind of liquid bread, it is natural for the two to  commingle in Rabbits whether they are blond Dutch or black  pumpernickel. And since cheese is only solid milk, and the Cheddar is  noted for its beery smell, there is further affinity here. An old  English proverb sums it up neatly: \"Bread and cheese are the two  targets against death.\"    By the way, the word pumpernickel is said to have been coined when  Napoleon tasted his first black bread in Germany. Contemptuously he  spat it out with: \"This would be good for my horse, Nicole.\" \"_Bon  pour Nicole_\" in French.       Gruyere Welsh Rabbit _au gratin_         Cut crusts from a half-dozen slices of bread. Toast them lightly,       lay in a roasting pan and top each with a matching slice of       imported Gruyere 3/8-inch thick. Pepper to taste and cover with       bread crumbs. Put in oven 10 minutes and rush to the ultimate       consumer.    To our American ears anything _au gratin_ suggests \"with cheese,\" so  this Rabbit _au gratin_ may sound redundant. To a Frenchman, however,  it means a dish covered with bread crumbs.       Swiss Cheese Rabbit    1/2 cup white wine, preferably Neufchatel  1/2 cup grated Gruyere  1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  1/2 saltspoon paprika  2 egg yolks         Stir wine and seasonings together with the cheese until it melts,       then thicken with the egg yolks, stirring at least 3 more minutes       until smooth.       Sherry Rabbit    3 cups grated cheese  1/2 cup cream or evaporated milk  1/2 cup sherry  1/4 teaspoon English mustard  1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  A dash of paprika         Heat cheese over hot water, with or without a bit of butter, and       when it begins to melt, stir in the cream. Keep stirring until       almost all of the cheese is melted, then add sherry. When smooth       and creamy, stir in the mustard and Worcestershire sauce, and       after pouring over buttered toast dash with paprika for color.       Spanish Sherry Rabbit    3 tablespoons butter  3 tablespoons flour  1 bouillon cube, mashed  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon dry mustard  1-1/2 cups milk  1-1/2 cups grated cheese  1 jigger sherry         Make a smooth paste of butter, flour, bouillon cube and       seasonings, and add milk slowly. When well-heated stir in the       cheese gradually. Continue stirring at least 10 minutes, and when       well-blended stir in the sherry and serve on hot, buttered toast.       Pink Poodle    2 tablespoons butter  1 tablespoon chopped onion  1 tablespoon flour  1 jigger California claret  1 cup cream of tomato soup  A pinch of soda  1/2 teaspoon dry mustard  1/2 teaspoon salt  1 teaspoon paprika  A dash of powdered cloves  3 cups grated cheese  1 egg, lightly beaten         Cook onion in butter until light golden, then blend in flour,       wine and soup with the soda and all seasonings. Stir in cheese       slowly until melted and finish off by thickening with the egg and       stirring until smooth and velvety. Serve on crisp, buttered toast       with a dry red wine.    Although wine Rabbits, red or white, are as unusual as Swiss ones with  Gruyere in place of Cheddar, wine is commonly drunk with anything from  a Golden Buck to a Blushing Bunny. But for most of us, a deep draught  of beer or ale goes best with an even deeper draught of the mellow  scent of a Cheddar golden-yellow.       Savory Eggy Dry Rabbit    1/8 pound butter  2 cups grated Gruyere  4 eggs, well-beaten  Salt  Pepper  Mustard         Melt butter and cheese together with the beaten eggs, stirring       steadily with wooden spoon until soft and smooth. Season and pour       over dry toast.    This \"dry\" Rabbit, in which the volume of the eggs makes up for any  lacking liquid, is still served as a savory after the sweets to finish  a fine meal in some old-fashioned English homes and hostelries.       Cream Cheese Rabbit         This Rabbit, made with a package of cream cheese, is more       scrambled hen fruit than Rabbit food, for you simply scramble a       half-dozen eggs with butter, milk, salt, pepper and cayenne, and       just before the finish work in the cheese until smooth and serve       on crackers--water crackers for a change.

Sprinkle       salt in upper part of double boiler. Boil over medium flame. When       upper part is hot, put in cheese, powdered milk, baking powder,       gelatin, caraway seeds and pepper and garlic powder to taste.       Mix. Break eggs into this mixture, cook over low flame,       continually stirring. Add tomatoes when mixture bubbles and       continue cooking and stirring until tomatoes have been cooked       soft. Remove to lettuce and/or cucumber (sliced thin) which has       been slightly marinated in wine vinegar and sprinkle the parsley       flakes over the top of the mixture.       Curry Rabbit    1 tablespoon cornstarch  2 cups milk  2-1/2 cups grated cheese  1 tablespoon minced chives  2 green onions, minced  2 shallots, minced  1/4 teaspoon imported curry powder  1 tablespoon chutney sauce         Dissolve cornstarch in a little of the milk and scald the rest       over hot water. Thicken with cornstarch mixture and stir in the       cheese, chives, onions, shallots, curry and chutney while       wooden-spooning steadily until smooth and sizzling enough to pour       over buttered toast.    People who can't let well enough alone put cornstarch in Rabbits, just  as they add soda to spoil the cooking of vegetables.       Ginger Ale Rabbit         Simply substitute ginger ale for the real thing in the No. 1       Rabbit of all time.       Buttermilk Rabbit         Substitute buttermilk for plain milk in the No. 2 Rabbit. To be       consistent, use fresh-cured Buttermilk Cheese, instead of the       usual Cheddar of fresh cow's milk. This is milder.       Eggnog Rabbit    2 tablespoons sweet butter  2 cups grated mellow Cheddar  1-1/3 cups eggnog  Dashes of spice to taste.         After melting the cheese in butter, stir in the eggnog and keep       stirring until smooth and thickened. Season or not, depending on       taste and the quality of eggnog employed.    Ever since the innovation of bottled eggnogs fresh from the milkman in  holiday season, such supremely creamy and flavorful Rabbits have been  multiplying as fast as guinea pigs.       All-American Succotash Rabbit    1 cup milk  3 tablespoons butter  3 tablespoons flour  3 cups grated cheese  1 cup creamed succotash, strained  Salt and pepper         Make a white sauce of milk, butter and flour and stir in the       cheese steadily and gradually until melted. Add the creamed       succotash and season to taste.         Serve on toasted, buttered corn bread.       Danish Rabbit    1 quart warm milk  2 cups grated cheese         Stir together to boiling point and pour over piping-hot toast in       heated bowl. This is an esteemed breakfast dish in north Denmark.         As in all Rabbits, more or less cheese may be used, to taste.     Easy English Rabbit         Soak bread slices in hot beer.

No one can shirk his responsibility by  sneering, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" The Government of the United  States and the thirteen other countries have promised to protect  these people, to care for their \"material and moral welfare,\" and  that promise is morally binding upon the people of those countries.  How much Leopold cares for the material welfare of the natives is  illustrated by the prices he pays the \"boys\" who worked on the  government steamer in which I went up the Kasai. They were bound on  a three months' voyage, and for each month's work on this trip they  were given in payment their rice and eighty cents. That is, at the  end of the trip they received what in our money would be equivalent  to two dollars and forty cents. And that they did not receive in  money, but in \"trade goods,\" which are worth about ten per cent less  than their money value. So that of the two dollars and eighty cents  that is due them, these black boys, who for three months sweated in  the dark jungle cutting wood, are robbed by this King of twenty-four  cents. One would dislike to grow rich at that price.     [Illustration: English Missionaries, and Some of Their Charges.]    In the French Congo I asked the traders at Libreville what they paid  their boys for cutting mahogany. I found the price was four francs a  day without \"chop,\" or three and a half francs with \"chop.\" That  is, on one side of the river the French pay in cash for one day's  work what Leopold pays in trade goods for the work of a month. As a  result the natives run away to the French side, and often, I might  almost say invariably, when at the _poste de bois_ on the Congo side  we would find two cords of wood, on the other bank at the post for  the French boats we would count two hundred and fifty cords of wood.  I took photographs of the native villages in all the colonies, in  order to show how they compared--of the French and Belgian wood  posts, the one well stocked and with the boys lying about asleep or  playing musical instruments, or alert to trade and barter, and on  the Belgian side no wood, and the unhappy white man alone, and  generally shivering with fever. Had the photographs only developed  properly they would have shown much more convincingly than one can  write how utterly miserable is the condition of the Congo negro. And  the condition of the white man at the wood posts is only a little  better. We found one man absolutely without supplies. He was only  twenty-four hours distant from Leopoldville, but no supplies had  been sent him. He was ill with fever, and he could eat nothing but  milk. Captain Jensen had six cans of condensed milk, which the State  calculated should suffice for him and his passengers for three  months. He turned the lot over to the sick man.    We found another white man at the first wood post on the Kasai just  above where it meets the Congo. He was in bed and dangerously ill  with enteric fever. He had telegraphed the State at Leopoldville and  a box of medicines had been sent to him; but the State doctors had  forgotten to enclose any directions for their use. We were as  ignorant of medicines as the man himself, and, as it was impossible  to move him, we were forced to leave him lying in his cot with the  row of bottles and tiny boxes, that might have given him life,  unopened at his elbow. It was ten days before the next boat would  touch at his post. I do not know that it reached him in time. One  could tell dozens of such stories of cruelty to natives and of  injustice and neglect to the white agents.    The fact that Leopold has granted to American syndicates control  over two great territories in the Congo may bring about a better  state of affairs, and, in any event, it may arouse public interest  in this country. It certainly should be of interest to Americans  that some of the most prominent of their countrymen have gone into  close partnership with a speculator as unscrupulous and as notorious  as is Leopold, and that they are to exploit a country which as yet  has been developed only by the help of slavery, with all its  attendant evils of cruelty and torture.    That Leopold has no right to give these concessions is a matter  which chiefly concerns the men who are to pay for them, but it is an  interesting fact.    The Act of Berlin expressly states: _\"No Power which exercises, or  shall exercise, sovereign rights in the above-mentioned regions,  shall be allowed to grant therein a monopoly or favor of any kind in  matters of trade.\"_    Leopold is only a steward placed by the Powers over the Congo. He is  a janitor. And he has no more authority to give even a foot of  territory to Belgians, Americans, or Chinamen than the janitor of an  apartment house has authority to fill the rooms with his wife's  relations or sell the coal in the basement.    The charge that the present concessionaires have no title that any  independent trader or miner need respect is one that is sure to be  brought up when the Powers throw Leopold out, and begin to clean  house. The concessionaires take a sporting chance that Leopold will  not be thrown out. It should be remembered that it is to his and to  their advantage to see that he is not.    In November of 1906, Leopold gave the International Forestry and  Mining Company of the Congo mining rights in territories adjoining  his private park, the _Domaine de la Couronne_, and to the American  Congo Company he granted the right to work rubber along the Congo  River to where it joins the Kasai. This latter is a territory of  four thousand square miles. The company also has the option within  the next eleven years of buying land in any part of a district which  is nearly one-half of the entire Congo. Of the Forestry and Mining  Company one-half of the profits go to Leopold, one-fourth to  Belgians, and the remaining fourth to the Americans. Of the profits  of the American Congo Company, Leopold is entitled to one-half and  the Americans to the other half. This company was one originally  organized to exploit a new method of manufacturing crude rubber from  the plant. The company was taken over by Thomas F. Ryan and his  associates. Back of both companies are the Guggenheims, who are to  perform the actual work in the mines and in the rubber plantation.  Early in March a large number of miners and engineers were selected  by John Hays Hammond, the chief engineer of the Guggenheim  Exploration Companies, and A. Chester Beatty, and were sent to  explore the territory granted in the mining concession. Another  force of experts are soon to follow. The legal representative of the  syndicates has stated that in the Congo they intend to move \"on  commercial lines.\" By that we take it they mean they will give the  native a proper price for his labor; and instead of offering  \"bonuses\" and \"commissions\" to their white employees will pay them  living wages. The exact terms of the concessions are wrapped in  mystery. Some say the territories ceded to the concessionaires are  to be governed by them, policed by them, and that within the  boundaries of these concessions the Americans are to have absolute  control. If this be so the syndicates are entering upon an  experiment which for Americans is almost without precedent. They  will be virtually what in England is called a chartered company,  with the difference that the Englishmen receive their charter from  their own government, while the charter under which the Americans  will act will be granted by a foreign Power, and for what they may  do in the Congo their own government could not hold them  responsible. They are answerable only to the Power that issued the  charter; and that Power is the just, the humane, the merciful  Leopold.    The history of the early days of chartered companies in Africa,  notoriously those of the Congo, Northern Nigeria, Rhodesia, and  German Central Africa does not make pleasant reading. But until the  Americans in the Congo have made this experiment, it would be most  unfair (except that the company they choose to keep leaves them open  to suspicion) not to give them the benefit of the doubt. One can at  least say for them that they seem to be absolutely ignorant of the  difficulties that lie before them. At least that is true of all of  them to whom I have talked.    The attorney of the Rubber Company when interviewed by a  representative of a New York paper is reported to have said: \"We  have purchased a privilege from a Sovereign State and propose to  operate it along purely commercial lines. With King Leopold's  management of Congo affairs in the past, or, with _what he may do in  an administrative way in the future, we have absolutely nothing to  do_.\" The italics are mine.    When asked: \"Under your concessions are you given similar powers  over the native blacks as are enjoyed by other concessionaires?\" the  answer of the attorney, as reported, was: \"The problem of labor is  not mentioned in the concession agreement, neither is the question  of local administration. We are left to solve the labor problem in  our own way, on a purely commercial basis, and with the question of  government we have absolutely nothing whatever to do. The labor  problem will not be formidable. Our mills are simple affairs. One  man can manage them, and the question of the labor on the rubber  concession is reduced to the minimum.\" This answer of the learned  attorney shows an ignorance of \"labor\" conditions in the Congo which  is, unless assumed, absolutely abject.    If the American syndicates are not to police and govern the  territories ceded them, but if these territories are to continue to  be administered by Leopold, it is not possible for the Americans to  have \"absolutely nothing to do\" with that administration. Leopold's  sole idea of administration is that every black man is his slave, in  other"]]]
