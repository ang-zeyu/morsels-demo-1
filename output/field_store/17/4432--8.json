His army was now, as before, greatly  the superior in numbers; and though the bearing of his troops was more  modest, their gallantry remained unimpaired. Once more the old general  divided his army; and once more he was destined to see it shattered in  detail.    He marched from Trent towards Mantua, through the defiles of the Brenta,  at the head of 30,000; leaving 20,000 under Davidowich at Roveredo, to  cover the Tyrol. Buonaparte instantly detected the error of his  opponent. He suffered him to advance unmolested as far as Bassano, and  the moment he was there, and consequently completely separated from  Davidowich and his rear, drew together a strong force, and darted on  Roveredo, by marches such as seemed credible only after they had been  accomplished.    The battle of Roveredo (Sept. 4) is one of Napoleon's most illustrious  days. The enemy had a strongly entrenched camp in front of the town; and  behind it, in case of misfortune, Calliano, with its castle seated on a  precipice over the Adige, where that river flows between enormous rocks  and mountains, appeared to offer an impregnable retreat. Nothing could  withstand the ardour of the French. The Austrians, though they defended  the entrenched camp with their usual obstinacy, were forced to give way  by the impetuosity of Dubois and his hussars. Dubois fell, mortally  wounded, in the moment of his glory: he waved his sabre, cheering his  men onwards with his last breath. \"I die,\" said he, \"for the  Republic;--only let me hear, ere life leaves me, that the victory is  ours.\" The French horse, thus animated, pursued the Germans, who were  driven, unable to rally, through and beyond the town. Even the gigantic  defences of Calliano proved of no avail. Height after height was carried  at the point of the bayonet; 7000 prisoners and fifteen cannon remained  with the conquerors. The Austrians fled to Levisa, which guards one of  the chief defiles of the Tyrolese Alps, and were there beaten again.  Vaubois occupied this important position with the gallant division who  had forced it. Massena fixed himself in Wurmser's late headquarters at  Trent; and Napoleon, having thus totally cut off the field-marshal's  communication with Germany, proceeded to issue proclamations calling on  the inhabitants of the Tyrol to receive the French as friends, and seize  the opportunity of freeing themselves for ever from the dominion of  Austria. He put forth an edict declaring that the sovereignty of the  district was henceforth in the French Republic, and inviting the people  themselves to arrange, according to their pleasure, its interior  government.    The French general made a grievous mistake when he supposed that the  Tyrolese were divided in their attachment to the Imperial government,  because he had found the Italian subjects of that crown to be so. The  Tyrol, one of the most ancient of the Austrian possessions, had also  been one of the best governed; the people enjoyed all the liberty they  wished under a paternal administration. They received with scornful  coldness the flattering exhortations of one in whom they saw only a  cunning and rapacious enemy; and Buonaparte was soon satisfied that it  would cost more time than was then at his disposal to republicanise  those gallant mountaineers. They, in truth, began to arm themselves, and  waited but the signal to rise everywhere upon the invaders.    Wurmser heard with dismay the utter ruin of Davidowich; and doubted not  that Napoleon would now march onwards into Germany, and joining Jourdan  and Moreau, whose advance he had heard of, and misguessed to have been  successful, endeavour to realise the great scheme of Carnot--that of  attacking Vienna itself. The old general saw no chance of converting  what remained to him of his army to good purpose, but by abiding in  Lombardy, where he thought he might easily excite the people in his  emperor's favour, overwhelm the slender garrisons left by Buonaparte,  and so cut off, at all events, the French retreat through Italy, in case  they should meet with any disaster in the Tyrol or in Germany. Napoleon  had intelligence which Wurmser wanted. Wurmser himself was his mark; and  he returned from Trent to Primolano where the Imperialist's vanguard  lay, by a forced march of not less than sixty miles performed in two  days. The surprise with which this descent was received may be imagined.  The Austrian van was destroyed in a twinkling. The French, pushing  everything before them, halted that night at Cismone--where Napoleon was  glad to have half a private soldier's ration of bread for his supper.  Next day he reached Bassano where the aged Marshal once more expected  the fatal rencounter. The battle of Bassano (Sept. 8) was a fatal  repetition of those that had gone before it. Six thousand men laid down  their arms. Quasdonowich, with one division of 4000, escaped to Friuli;  while Wurmser himself, retreating to Vicenza, there collected with  difficulty a remnant of 16,000 beaten and discomfited soldiers. His  situation was most unhappy; his communication with Austria wholly cut  off--his artillery and baggage all lost--the flower of his army no more.  Nothing seemed to remain but to throw himself into Mantua, and there  hold out to the last extremity, in the hope, however remote, of some  succours from Vienna; and such was the resolution of this often  outwitted but never dispirited veteran.    In order to execute his purpose, it was necessary to force a passage  somewhere on the Adige; and the Austrian, especially as he had lost all  his pontoons, would have had great difficulty in doing so, but for a  mistake on the part of the French commander at Legnago, who, conceiving  the attempt was to be made at Verona, marched to reinforce the corps  stationed there, and thus left his proper position unguarded. Wurmser,  taking advantage of this, passed with his army at Legnago, and after a  series of bloody skirmishes, in which fortune divided her favours pretty  equally, was at length enabled to throw himself into Mantua. Napoleon  made another narrow escape, in one of these skirmishes, at Arcola. He  was surrounded for a moment, and had just galloped off, when Wurmser  coming up and learning that the prize was so near, gave particular  directions to bring him in alive!    Buonaparte, after making himself master of some scattered corps which  had not been successful in keeping up with Wurmser, re-appeared once  more before Mantua. The battle of St. George--so called from one of the  suburbs of the city--was fought on the 13th of September, and after  prodigious slaughter, the French remained in possession of all the  causeways; so that the blockade of the city and fortress was henceforth  complete. The garrison, when Wurmser shut himself up, amounted to  26,000. Before October was far advanced the pestilential air of the  place, and the scarcity and badness of provisions, had filled his  hospitals, and left him hardly half the number in fighting condition.  The misery of the besieged town was extreme; and if Austria meant to  rescue Wurmser, there was no time to be lost.    [Footnote 10: Vallette was cashiered. Augereau was afterwards created  Duke of Castiglione, in memory of this exploit.]          CHAPTER VII         Affairs of Corsica--Alvinzi assumes the Command of the Austrians on       the Italian frontier--The three Battles of Arcola--Retreat of       Alvinzi--Battle of Rivoli--Battle of La Favorita--Surrender of       Mantua--Victor marches on Ancona--Despair of the Pope--Treaty of       Tollentino.      The French party in Corsica had not contemplated without pride and  exultation the triumphs of their countryman. His seizure of Leghorn, by  cutting off the supplies from England, greatly distressed the opposite  party in the island, and an expedition of Corsican exiles, which he now  despatched from Tuscany, was successful in finally reconquering the  country. To Napoleon this acquisition was due; nor were the Directory  insensible to its value. He, meanwhile, had heavier business on his  hands.    The Austrian council well knew that Mantua was in excellent keeping; and  being now relieved on the Rhenish frontier, by the failure of Jourdan  and Moreau's attempts, were able to form once more a powerful armament  on that of Italy. The supreme command was given to Marshal Alvinzi, a  veteran of high reputation. He, having made extensive levies in Illyria,  appeared at Friuli; while Davidowich, with the remnant of Quasdonowich's  army, amply recruited among the bold peasantry of the Tyrol, and with  fresh drafts from the Rhine, took ground above Trent. The marshal had in  all 60,000 men under his orders. Buonaparte had received only twelve new  battalions, to replace all the losses of those terrible campaigns, in  which three imperial armies had already been annihilated. The enemy's  superiority of numbers was once more such, that nothing but the most  masterly combinations on the part of the French general could have  prevented them from sweeping everything before them in the plains of  Lombardy.    Buonaparte heard in the beginning of October that Alvinzi's columns were  in motion: he had placed Vaubois to guard Trent, and Massena at Bassano  to check the march of the field-marshal: but neither of these generals  was able to hold his ground. The troops of Vaubois were driven from  that position of Calliano, the strength of which has been already  mentioned, under circumstances which Napoleon considered disgraceful to  the character of the French soldiery. Massena avoided battle; but such  was the overwhelming superiority of Alvinzi, that he was forced to  abandon the position of Bassano. Napoleon himself hurried forward to  sustain Massena; and a severe rencontre, in which either "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#12)"],[1,"later at  Boden.    It was extraordinarily interesting to sleep in that little shanty at  Boden, partly, no doubt, because it was not ordinarily allowed. The  forbidden has always charms. It was the most glorious starlight night I  have ever seen, but bitterly cold, with the thermometer ten degrees  below zero, and everything sparkling with hoar frost. It was here we  nearly lost a bishop. A rather pompous Anglican bishop had been  travelling in the same train from Stockholm, and hearing that we  insignificant females had been permitted to sleep at Boden, he did not  see why he should not do the same and save himself the tiresome journey  to Lulea and back. So in spite of all remonstrances he insisted on  alighting at Boden, and with the whole force of his ecclesiastical  authority announced his intention of staying there. However, it was not  allowed after all, and he missed the train, and while we were  comfortably having our supper in the little inn, we saw the poor bishop  and his chaplain being driven off to Lulea. They turned up again next  morning, but so late that we were afraid they had got lost on the way  the night before.    All the next morning we went through the same kind of country, past  innumerable frozen lakelets, and copses of stubby pines and silver  birches, till we arrived at Karungi where the railway ends. We made  friends with a most delightful man, who was so good in helping us all  the way through that we christened him St. Raphael, the patron saint of  travellers. He was a fur trader from Finland, and had immense stores of  information about the land and the queer beasts that live in it. He was  a sociable soul, but lived in such out-of-the-way places that he seldom  saw anyone to talk to except the peasants, and it was a great treat, he  said, to meet some of his fellow-countrymen, and his satisfaction knew  no bounds when he heard that one of us hailed from Lancashire, near his  old home.    From Karungi we had to drive to Haparanda. Our carriage was already  booked by telegram, but a very irate gentleman from Port Said got into  it with his family and declined to get out, using such dreadful  language that I wondered the snow did not begin to sizzle. We did not  want to have a scene there, so when \"St. Raphael\" said if we would wait  till the evening he would take us over by starlight, we graciously let  the dusky gentleman with the bad temper keep our carriage.    We went in the meantime to the little wooden inn and ate largely of  strange dishes, dried reindeer flesh, smoked strips of salmon, lax, I  think it is called, served with a curious sweet sauce, and drank many  glasses of tea. At 9 P. M. behold an open motor-car arrived to  take us the thirty miles' drive to Haparanda. It seemed absolutely  absurd to see a motor-car up there on the edge of the Arctic Circle,  where there was not even a proper road. There were several reindeer  sleighs about, and I felt that one of those would have been much more in  keeping. The drivers look most attractive, they wear very gay reindeer  leggings, big sheep-skin coats and wild-looking wolf-skin caps.    The frozen track was so uneven that we rocked from side to side, and  were thrown violently about in the car, like little kernels in a very  large nut. But it was a wonderful night all the same, the air was thin  and intoxicating like champagne, and the stars up in these northern  latitudes more dazzlingly brilliant than anything I have seen before. We  had to get out at Haparanda and walk over the long bridge which led to  Torneo, where the Finnish Custom House was, and where our luggage and  passports had to be examined.    We arrived there very cheerful and well pleased with ourselves, to find  all our old travelling companions waiting till the Custom House was  open; the bishop and his party; the bad-tempered man and his family; a  Russian and a Chinese student who were travelling together, and some  others. They had been waiting in the cold for hours, and had not had  their papers or luggage examined yet, so we had had the best of it after  all.    And we scored yet once more, for \"St. Raphael,\" who spoke fluent  Finnish, at once secured the only cart to take our things over the ferry  to the railway station about half a mile away.    It was borne in upon me during this journey what an immense country  Russia is. From Torneo to Petrograd does not look far on the map, but  we left Torneo on Wednesday night, and did not arrive in Petrograd till  12.30 A. M. on Saturday, about fifty-two hours' hard travelling  to cover this little track--a narrow thread, almost lost the immensity  of this great Empire.    Petrograd is not one of those cities whose charms steal upon you  unawares. It is immense, insistent, arresting, almost thrusting itself  on your imagination. It is a city for giants to dwell in, everything is  on such an enormous scale, dealt out in such careless profusion. The  river, first of all, is immense; the palaces grandiose, the very blocks  of which they are fashioned seem to have been hewn by Titans. The names  are full of romance and mystery. The fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul,  for instance, how it brings back a certain red and gold book of one's  youth, full of innocent prisoners in clanking chains confined in fetid  underground dungeons. It seemed incredible to really behold its slender,  golden minarets on the other side of the Neva. But this was no time for  sight-seeing, we were all very anxious to get to work at once. So my  first excursion in Petrograd was to the Central Bureau of the Red  Cross.    The director of the Red Cross received me most kindly and promised that  we should have work very soon. He suggested that in the meantime we  should go and stay in a Russian Community of Sisters, who had a hospital  in Petrograd. I was very glad to accept this offer for us all, for we  must assimilate Russian methods and ways of thought as soon as possible,  if we were to be of real use to them. Still I very much hoped that we  should not be kept in Petrograd very long, as we wanted, if possible, to  get nearer the front. I told the director that we had been inoculated  against cholera and typhoid, and would be quite pleased to be sent to  the infectious hospitals if that would be more help, as there are always  plenty of people to nurse the wounded, but comparatively few who for one  reason or another are able to devote themselves to this other very  necessary work.    We betook ourselves without delay to the Community of Russian Sisters,  and were installed in dear little cell-like rooms at the top of the  house devoted to the Sisters. The other side of the house is a  beautiful little hospital with several wards set apart for wounded  soldiers. There are a great many similar communities in Russia--all  nursing orders. They are called Sisters of Mercy, but are not nuns in  any sense, as they take no vows and are free to leave whenever they  like. The course of training varies from two to three years and is very  complete, comprising courses in dispensing and other useful subjects.  The pity of it is that there are comparatively few of these trained  Sisters at the front; the vast majority of those working there have only  been through a special \"War Course\" of two months' training, and are apt  to think that bandaging is the beginning and the end of the art of  nursing.    The Russian Sisters were most interested in our adventures, and most  kind and nice to us in every way, but assured us that we should not be  allowed anywhere near the front, as only Russian Sisters were allowed  there. They were very surprised when the order came a few days after our  arrival, that we were to get ready to go to Warsaw at once. That was  certainly not quite at the front at that moment, as just then Russia  was in the flush of victory, following the retreating Germans back from  Warsaw to the German frontier. But it was a good long step on the way.    One errand still remained to be done. I had not posted the letter given  me by the English lady at the Brussels station to her husband in  Petrograd, wishing to have the pleasure of delivering it myself after  carrying it at such risks all through Germany. Directly I arrived I made  inquiries for this Englishman, picturing his joy at getting the  long-deferred news of his wife. Almost the first person I asked knew him  quite well, but imagine what a blow it was to hear that he had a Russian  wife in Petrograd! I vowed never again to carry any more letters to  sorrowing husbands.    Before we went I received a very kind message that the Empress Marie  Federovna would like to see us before our departure. Prince Gustav of  Denmark had been most kind in writing to his aunt, the Empress, about  us, and had also been good enough to give me a letter of introduction to  her which I sent through the British Embassy.    A day was appointed to go to the Gatchina Palace to be presented to her  Majesty. The palace is a little way out of Petrograd and stands in a  beautiful park between the Black and the White Lake.    We were greeted by General K----, one of the Empress's bodyguard, and  waited for a few minutes in the throne room downstairs, chatting to him.  Soon we were summoned upstairs, a door was thrown open by an enormous  negro in scarlet livery, and we were ushered into the Empress's private  boudoir. The Empress was there, and was absolutely charming to us,  making us sit down beside her and talking to us in fluent English. She  was so interested in hearing all we could tell her of Belgium, and we  stayed about half an hour talking to her. Then the Empress rose and held  out her hand, and said, \"Thank you very much for coming to help us in  Russia. I shall always be interested in hearing about you. May God bless  you in your work,\" and we were dismissed.    I would not have missed that for anything, it seemed such a nice start  to our work in Russia.    Every spare moment till our "]]]
