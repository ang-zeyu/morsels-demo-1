Secondly, books are printed  in black on a white ground; the eye is thus in presence of the most  absolute contrast which can be imagined. The third peculiarity lies in  the arrangement of the characters in horizontal lines, over which we  run our eyes. If we maintain during reading a perfect immobility of  the book and the head, the printed lines are applied successively to  the same parts of the retina, while the interspaces, more bright, also  affect certain regions of the retina, always the same. There must  result from this a fatigue analogous to that which we experience when  we make experiments in \"accidental images,\" and physicists will admit  that there is nothing more disastrous for the sight than the prolonged  contemplation of these images. Lastly, and most important of all in M.  Javel's estimation, is the continual variation of the distance of the  eye from the point of fixation on the book. A simple calculation  demonstrates that the accommodation of the eye to the page undergoes a  distinct variation in proportion as the eye passes from the beginning  to the end of each line, and that this variation is all the greater in  proportion to the nearness of the book to the eye and the length of  the line. As to the rules which M. Javel inculcates in order that the  injurious effects of reading may be avoided, with reference to the  permanent application of the eyes, he counsels to avoid excess, to  take notes in reading, to stop in order to reflect or even to roll a  cigarette; but not to go on reading for hours on end without stopping.  As to the contrast between the white of the paper and the black of the  characters, various experiments have been made in the introduction of  colored papers. M. Javel advises the adoption of a slightly yellow  tint. But the nature of the yellow to be used is not a matter of  indifference; he would desire a yellow resulting from the absence of  the blue rays, analogous to that of paper made from a wood paste, and  which is often mistakenly corrected by the addition of an ultramarine  blue, which produces gray and not white. M. Javel has been led to this  conclusion both from practical observation and also theoretically from  the relation which must exist between the two eyes and the colors of  the spectrum. His third advice is to give preference to small volumes  which can be held in the hand, which obviates the necessity of the  book being kept fixed in one place, and the fatigue resulting from  accidental images. Lastly, M. Javel advises the avoidance of too long  lines, and therefore he prefers small volumes, and for the same reason  those journals which are printed in narrow columns. Of course every  one knows that it is exceedingly injurious to read with insufficient  light, or to use too small print, and other common rules. M. Javel  concludes by protesting against an invidious assertion which has  recently been made \"in a neighboring country,\" according to which the  degree of civilization of a people is proportional to the number of  the short sighted shown to exist by statistics; the extreme economy of  light, the abuse of reading to the detriment of reflection and the  observation of real facts, the employment of Gothic characters and of  a too broad column for books and journals, are the conditions which,  M. Javel believes, lead to myopy, especially if successive generations  have been subjected to these injurious influences.           *       *       *       *       *          PHOSPHORESCENCE.      M. Nuesch records, in a recent number of the _Journal de Pharmacie_,  some curious observations regarding luminous bacteria in fresh meat.  Some pork cutlets, he found, illuminated his kitchen so that he could  read the time on his watch. The butcher who sent the meat told him the  phosphorescence was first observed in a cellar, where he kept scraps  for making sausages. By degrees all his meat became phosphorescent,  and fresh meat from distant towns got into the same state. On  scratching the surface or wiping it vigorously, the phosphorescence  disappears for a time; and the butcher wiped carefully the meat he  sent out. All parts of the animal, except the blood, acquired the  phenomenon over their whole surface. The meat must be fresh; when it  ceases to be so, the phosphorescence ceases, and _Bacterium termo_  appear. None of the customers had been incommoded. It was remarked  that if a small trace of the phosphorescent matter were put at any  point on the flesh of cats, rabbits, etc., the phosphorescence  gradually spread out from the center, and in three or four days  covered the piece; it disappeared generally on the sixth or seventh  day. Cooked meat did not present the phenomenon but it could be had in  a weak manner, from cooked albumen or potatoes. No other butcher's  shop in the place was affected. The author is uncertain whether to  attribute the complete disappearance of the phenomenon to the higher  temperature of the season, or to phenic acid, or to fumigation with  chlorine.           *       *       *       *       *          THE CHARMS OF NATURAL SCIENCE.      The Earl of Derby, in an address at the Edinburgh University, said:  \"Of the gains derivable from natural science I do not trust myself to  speak; my personal knowledge is too limited, and the subject is too  vast. But so much as this I can say--that those who have in them a  real and deep love of scientific research, whatever their position in  other respects, are so far at least among the happiest of mankind....  No passion is so absorbing, no labor is so assuredly its own reward  (well that it is so, for other rewards are few); and they have the  satisfaction of knowing that, while satisfying one of the deepest  wants of their own natures, they are at the same time promoting in the  most effectual manner the interests of mankind. Scientific discovery  has this advantage over almost every other form of successful human  efforts, that its results are certain, that they are permanent, that  whatever benefits grow out of them are world-wide. Not many of us can  hope to extend the range of knowledge in however minute a degree; but  to know and to apply the knowledge that has been gained by others, to  have an intelligent appreciation of what is going on around us, is in  itself one of the highest and most enduring of pleasures.\"    THE VESUVIUS RAIL WAY.--The Italian Ministry of Public Works, in union  with the Ministry of Finance and the Prefecture of Naples, has issued  the concession for the construction of the Vesuvius Railway. The line  will run along that part of the mountain which has been proved, after  the experience of many years, to be the least exposed to the  eruptions. The work is to be commenced immediately, and it is believed  that it will come into use during the present year. A sufficient  number of carriages are being built to convey 600 persons during the  day. The line is to be constructed upon an iron bridge, built after a  patented system.           *       *       *       *       *          THE POTTERY TREE.      Among the various economic products of the vegetable kingdom,  scarcely any hold a more important place than barks, whether for  medicinal, manufacturing, or other purposes. The structure and  formation of all barks are essentially very similar, being composed of  cellular and fibrous tissue. The cell contents of these tissues,  however, vary much in different plants; and, for this reason, we have  fibrous or soft, woody, hard, and even stony barks. To explain  everything which relates to the structure of bark would lead us into  long details which our space will not permit. Briefly stated, the bark  of trees (considering, now, those of our own climate) consists of  three layers. The outermost, called the \"cortical,\" is formed of  cellular tissue, and differs widely in consistency in different  species; thus, in the cork oak, which furnishes man with one of his  most useful commercial products, the cortical layer acquires  extraordinary thickness. The middle layer, called the \"cellular\" or  \"green bark,\" is a cellular mass of a very different nature. The cells  of which it is composed are polyhedral, thicker, and more loosely  joined, and filled with sap and chlorophyl. The inner layer (next the  wood), called the \"liber,\" consists of fibers more or less long and  tenacious. It is from the liber that our most valuable commercial  fibers are obtained. In some plants the fibrous system prevails  throughout the inner bark; but what we wish to refer to more  particularly at present is a remarkable example of the harder and more  silicious barks, and which is to be found in the \"Pottery Tree\" of  Para. This tree, known to the Spaniards as _El Caouta_, to the French  as _Bois de Fer_, to the Brazilians as _Caraipe_, is the _Moquilea  utilis_ of botanists, and belongs to the natural order _Ternstroeiaceae_.  It is very large, straight, and slender, reaching a height of 100 feet  before branching; its diameter is from 12 to 15 inches; and its wood  is exceedingly hard from containing much flinty matter. Although the  wood of the tree is exceedingly sound and durable, the great value of  the tree to the natives exists in the bark for a purpose which, to say  the least, is a novel one in the application of barks--that of the  manufacture of pottery. The Indians employed in the manufacture of  pottery from this material always keep a stock of it on hand in their  huts for the purpose of drying and seasoning it, as it then burns more  freely, and the ashes can be gathered with more ease than when fresh.  In the process of manufacturing the pottery the ashes of the bark are  powdered and mixed with the purest clay that can be obtained from the  beds of the rivers; this kind being preferred, as it takes up a larger  quantity of the ash, and thus produces a stronger kind "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18880"],[0,"The New York Times Current History: the European War, February, 1915 (#12)"],[1,"presently, but meanwhile I must  make a little digression in order to anticipate an objection that may be  made to the foregoing remarks.    Some conscientious inquirer, while admitting that there is a certain  resemblance between British and Russian territorial expansion, may  reasonably point to some important differences in the results. The  expansion of England, he may say, has resulted in spreading over the  world the benefits of civilization and freedom; her more important  colonies have grown into self-governing sister nations, who are showing  their loyalty and affection for the mother country by rushing to her  assistance in the present crisis; at the same time her great Indian  dependency and her Crown Colonies, which do not yet enjoy complete  self-government, are likewise showing their sympathetic appreciation of  the blessings conferred on them by the central power.    In comparison with all this, what has Russia to show? Not so much, I  confess, but she has effected considerable improvements in the annexed  territories. The great plains to the north of the Black Sea, which were  formerly the home of nomadic, predatory tribes, have been brought under  cultivation; the tents of the nomads have been replaced by thriving  villages, flaming blast furnaces, great foundries, and fine towns, such  as Odessa, Taganrog and Rostoff; the Crimea, whose inhabitants once  lived mainly by marauding expeditions and the slave trade, is now a  peaceful and prosperous province; in the Caucasus, which was long the  scene of constant tribal warfare and where the well-to-do inhabitants  were not ashamed to sell their young, beautiful daughters to the Pashas  of Constantinople, permanent order has been everywhere established and  many abuses suppressed; in Siberia, which was little better than a  wilderness, there are now thousands of prosperous farmers, railways and  river steamboats have been constructed, and the mineral resources are  being rapidly developed; thanks to the improvement of communications in  that part of the empire, Peking is now well within a fortnight of  Petrograd. Even in Central Asia there is evidence of improvement; the  Russian military administration, with all its defects, is better than  the native rule which preceded it. Such was, at least, the impression  which I received in semi-Russianized territories like Bokhara and  Samarcand. Thus, while we may be justly proud of our achievements in  imperial consolidation and progress, we may well regard with sympathy  the efforts of our rival in the same direction.    Apologizing for this little digression, I proceed now to consider very  briefly the danger of future conflict between the two great empires  which have come within striking distance of each other.    This danger, as it seems to me, though serious enough, is not so great  as is commonly supposed. We have many interests in common, as our  present alliance proves, and there are only two localities in which a  future conflict is to be apprehended. These are Constantinople and our  Indian frontier.    Napoleon is reported to have said that the nation which occupies  Constantinople must dominate the world. The present occupants have  proved that this dictum is, to say the least, an exaggeration, but there  is no doubt that if Russia possessed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, her  power, for defensive and offensive purposes, would be greatly increased,  and she might seriously threaten our line of communications with India  through the Suez Canal. This danger, however, is very remote. So many  great powers are interested in preventing her from obtaining such a  commanding position in the Mediterranean, that if she made any  aggressive movement in that direction she would certainly find herself  confronted by a very formidable European coalition.    An attack on our Indian frontier is likewise, I venture to think, a very  improbable contingency. There may possibly be in Russia some political  dreamers who imagine, in their idle hours, that it would be a grand  thing to conquer India, with its teeming millions of inhabitants, and  appropriate the countless wealth which it is falsely supposed to  possess; but I have never met or heard of any serious Russian politician  capable of advocating such a hazardous enterprise. Certainly there is no  immediate danger. When the European struggle in which we are now engaged  is brought to an end, the nations who are taking part in it will husband  their resources for many years before launching into any wild  adventures. Moreover, our position in our great Eastern dependency has  never previously been so secure as it is now. The Government has long  been taking precautionary measures against possible troubles on the  frontier, and in the interior of the country the great mass of the  inhabitants are prosperous and contented. Hindus and Mahommedans alike  are learning to appreciate the benefits of British rule, as is shown by  the fact that in the present crisis the native Princes are generously  placing all the available resources of their States at the disposal of  the Central Government.    An additional security against danger in that quarter is afforded by the  character of the present Czar. His natural disposition is not at all of  the adventurous type, and he will doubtless profit by past experience.  He will not soon forget how he inadvertently drifted into the Japanese  conflict because he let himself be persuaded by ill-informed counselors  that a war with Japan was altogether out of the question. We can hardly  suppose that he will listen to such counselors a second time. Moreover,  he showed on one memorable occasion that he was animated with friendly  sentiments toward England. The incident has hitherto been kept secret,  but may now be divulged. During the South African war a hint came to him  from a foreign potentate that the moment had arrived for clipping  England's wings and that Russia might play a useful part in the  operation by making a military demonstration on the Afghan frontier. To  this suggestion the Czar turned a deaf ear. I am well aware that in  semi-official conversation the foreign potentate in question has  represented the incident in a very different light, but recent  experience has taught us to be chary of accepting literally any  diplomatic assurances coming from that quarter.    On this subject of possible future conflicts with Russia and of the best  means of averting them, I have a great deal more to say, but I have now  reached the limits of the space at my disposal, not to mention the  patience of my readers, I confine myself, therefore, to a single  additional remark. The conflicting interests of the two great empires  are not so irreconcilable as they are often represented, and the chances  of solving the difficult problem by mutually satisfactory compromises  may be greatly increased by cultivating friendly relations with the  power which was formerly our rival and is now happily our ally.          Confiscation of German Patents    [From Russkia Vedomosti, No. 235, Oct. 12 (25), 1914; No. 273, Nov. 27  (Dec. 10), 1914.]      The conference of the representatives of industry at the Ministry of  Commerce and Industry decided that it is desirable that the Government  should confiscate the patents granted to Austrian and German subjects  for inventions which may be of special interest for the State, provided,  however, that the patent holders should be reimbursed after the end of  the war.    The conference found it impossible to abolish the trade marks of German  and Austrian subjects, for this would hurt the Russian consumer, who  could be then easily cheated by false labels.    Two conflicting opinions prevailed in the conference. The one held that  the commercial treaties between Russia and Germany (and Austria) have  left the question of patents out of consideration, while the other  pointed out that the commercial treaties had granted to German subjects  equal rights and privileges with Russians as regards patents.    The decision seems to be a compromise between the two.    A delegation of the Moscow Merchants' Association, consisting of Messrs.  N.N. Shustov, I.G. Volkov, and A.D. Liamin, will soon go to Petrograd to  petition the Ministers of Finance, Commerce and Industry and of the  Interior for measures against German \"oppression.\" The delegation  intends to ask for the revocation of all privileges (franchises) and  patents granted to Austrian, German, and Turkish subjects and for the  granting to the Moscow merchants of the right to admit foreigners to the  Merchants' Association only at its own discretion.    Finally, the delegation intends to discuss with the Ministers the  special fund created recently at the State Bank for the settlement of  payments to foreign merchants belonging to the warring nations. With  this fund Russian merchants are depositing money for their matured  notes. Thus the payment for foreign goods is now better guaranteed than  before. The German merchants are taking advantage of this arrangement,  offering their goods to Russian consumers through their agents and  branch houses and commercial agents located in neutral countries.  Therefore the new arrangement helps rather than hurts the German trade  in Russia.          A Russian Income Tax    Proposed by the Ministry of Finance.    [From Russkia Vedomosti, No. 225, Oct. 1 (14), 1914.]      In the long list of new Russian taxes the income tax is the most  interesting. It is still only a drafted bill. The Government hesitates  to press it. Perhaps the Duma will take some steps to make this bill a  law. Its main provisions are as follows:    All annual incomes of 1,000 rubles ($500) and above are to be assessed  at a progressive rate ranging from 1-1/2 per cent. on 1,000 rubles to  the maximum of 8 per cent. on incomes of 200,000 rubles ($100,000) and  above. All persons engaged actively in the present war shall be exempt"]]]
