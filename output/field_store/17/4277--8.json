[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#12)"],[1,", I simply had to sit down and wait for  daybreak, sleep being entirely out of the question. In the night the  wind increased, and howled mournfully round the house. At four o'clock,  when day was about to break, I was ready to start, and some farewells  had to be said. These were calm, but not cheerful, for it was my firm  belief that, in all human probability, I should never see the familiar  faces again, knowing well they would sell their lives dearly.    It was reported amongst my friends at home that, in order to escape  from Mafeking, my maid and myself had ridden 200 miles. One newspaper  extract was sent me which said, concerning this fictitious ride, that it  \"was all very well for Lady Sarah, who doubtless was accustomed to  violent exercise, but we commiserate her poor maid.\" Their pity was  wasted, for the departure of my German maid Metelka and myself took  place prosaically in that most vile of all vehicles, a Cape cart. Six  fine mules were harnessed to our conveyance, and our two small  portmanteaus were strapped on behind. The Jehu was a Cape boy, and, to  complete the cortege, my white pony Dop brought up the rear, ridden by a  Zulu called Vellum. This boy, formerly Dr. Jameson's servant, remained  my faithful attendant during the siege; beneath his dusky skin beat a  heart of gold, and to him I could safely have confided uncounted  treasures. As the daylight increased so did the wind in violence; it was  blowing a perfect gale, and the dust and sand were blinding. We  outspanned for breakfast twelve miles out, at the farm of a presumably  loyal Dutchman; then on again, the wind by now having become a  hurricane, aggravated by the intensely hot rays of a scorching sun. I  have never experienced such a miserable drive, and I almost began to  understand the feelings of people who commit suicide. However, the long  day wore to a close, and at length we reached Setlagoli store and  hotel, kept by a nice old Scotch couple, Mr. and Mrs. Fraser. The latter  was most kind, and showed us two nice clean rooms. Here, anyway, I  trusted to find a haven of rest. This hope was of short duration, for  Sergeant Matthews, in charge of the Mounted Police depot, soon came and  told me natives reported several hundred Boers at Kraipann, only ten  miles away. He said they were lying in wait for the second armoured  train, which was expected to pass to Mafeking that very night, carrying  the howitzers so badly needed there, and some lyddite shells. The  sergeant opined the Boers would probably come on here if victorious, and  loot the store, and he added that such marauding bands were more to be  feared than the disciplined ones under Cronje. He even suggested my  leaving by moonlight that very night. The driver, however, was unwilling  to move, and we were all so exhausted that I decided to risk it and  remain, the faithful sergeant promising to send scouts out and warn us  should the enemy be approaching. I was fully determined that, having  left Mafeking, where I might have been of use, I would run no risks of  capture or impertinence from the burghers, who would also certainly  commandeer our cart, pony, and mules.    Then followed another endless night; the moon set at 1 a.m., and  occasionally I was roused by the loud and continuous barking of the  farm dogs. At four o'clock Vellum's dusky countenance peered into the  room, which opened on to the stoep, as do nearly all the apartments of  these hotels, to ask if the mules should be inspanned, for these natives  were all in wholesale dread of the Boers. Hearing all was quiet, I told  him to wait till the sergeant appeared. About an hour later I opened my  door to have a look at the weather: the wind had dropped completely, the  sky was cloudless, and a faint tinge of pink on the distant horizon  denoted where the east lay. I was about to shut it again and dress, when  a dull booming noise arrested my attention, then almost froze the blood  in my veins. There was no mistaking the firing of big guns at no very  great distance.    We are accustomed to such a sound when salutes are fired or on a  field-day, but I assure those who have not had a like experience, that  to hear the same in actual warfare, and to know that each detonation is  dealing death and destruction to human beings and property, sends a  shiver down the back akin to that produced by icy cold water. I counted  four or five; then there it was again and again and again, till  altogether I reckoned twenty shots, followed by impressive silence once  more, so intense in the quiet peace of the morning landscape. On the  farm, however, there was stir and bustle enough: alarmed natives  gathered in a group, weird figures with blankets round their  shoulders--for the air was exceedingly cold--all looking with straining  eyes in the direction of Kraipann, from where the firing evidently came.  I soon joined the people, white and back, in front of the store, and  before long a mounted Kaffir rode wildly up, and proceeded, with many  gesticulations, to impart information in his own tongue. His story took  some time, but at last a farmer turned round and told me the engagement  had been with the armoured train, as we anticipated, and that the latter  had \"fallen down\" (as the Kaffir expressed it) owing to the rails being  pulled up. What had been the fate of its occupants he did not know, as  he had left in terror when the big gun opened fire. Curiously enough, as  I afterwards learnt, these shots were the first fired during the war.    Remembering the sergeant's warning, I decided to start at once for  Mosita, twenty-five miles farther away from the border, leaving Vellum  to bring on any further intelligence when the sergeant, who had been  away all night watching the Boers, returned. We now traversed a fine  open grassy country, very desolate, with no human habitation. The only  signs of life were various fine \"pows\"[24] stalking sedately along, or  \"korans,\" starting up with their curious chuckle rather like the note  of a pheasant, or a covey of guinea-fowl scurrying across the road and  losing themselves in the waving grass. Meanwhile the driver kept up an  incessant conversation with the mules, and I found myself listening to  his varying epithets with stupefied curiosity. During that four hours'  drive we only met two natives and one huge herd of cattle, which were  being driven by mounted Kaffirs, armed with rifles, to Mosita, our  destination, where it was hoped they would be out of the way of  marauding Boers. At last we reached the native stadt of Mosita, where  our appearance created great excitement. Crowds of swarthy men and  youths rushed out to question our driver as to news. The latter waxed  eloquent in words and gestures, imitating even the noise of the big gun,  which seemed to produce great enthusiasm among these simple folk. Their  ruling passion, I afterwards found, was hatred and fear of the Boers,  and their dearest wish to possess guns and ammunition to join the  English in driving them back and to defend their cattle. In the distance  we could see the glimmering blue waters of a huge dam, beyond which was  the farm and homestead of a loyal colonial farmer named Keeley, whose  hospitality I had been told to seek. Close by were the barracks, with  seven or eight occupants, the same sort of depot as at Setlagoli. I  asked to see Mrs. Keeley, and boldly announced we had come to beg for a  few nights' lodging. We were most warmly received and made welcome. The  kindness of the Keeleys is a bright spot in my recollections of those  dark weeks. Mrs. Keeley herself was in a dreadful state of anxiety, as  she had that very day received a letter from her husband in Mafeking,  whither he had proceeded on business, to say he found he must remain and  help defend the town; his assistance was urgently needed there in  obtaining information respecting the Boers from the natives, whose  language he talked like his own. She had five small children, and was  shortly expecting an addition to her family, so at last I had found  someone who was more to be pitied than myself. She, on the other hand,  told me our arrival was a godsend to her, as it took her thoughts off  her troubles.    Affairs in the neighbourhood seemed in a strange confusion. Mr. Keeley  was actually the _Veldtcornet_ of the district, an office which in times  of peace corresponded to that of a magistrate. In reality he was shut up  in Mafeking, siding against the Dutch. The surrounding country was  peopled entirely, if sparsely, by Dutch farmers and natives, the former  of whom at first and before our reverses professed sympathy with the  English; but no wonder the poor wife looked to the future with dread,  fearful lest British disasters would be followed by Boer reprisals.    Towards sunset Vellum appeared with a note from Sergeant Matthews. It  ran as follows:    \"The armoured train captured; its fifteen occupants all killed.[25]  Boers opened fire on the train with field artillery.\"    In our isolation these words sank into our souls like lead, and were  intensified by the fact that we had that very morning been so near the  scene of the tragedy--\"reverse\" I would not allow it to be called, for  fifteen men had tried conclusions with 400 Boers, and had been merely  hopelessly outnumbered. The latter had, however, scored an initial  success, and the intelligence cast a gloom, even where all was blackest  night. Vellum brought a few more verbal details, to the effect that  Sergeant Matthews had actually succeeded in stopping the armoured train  after pursuing it on horseback for some way, expecting every moment to  be taken for a Boer and fired on. He asked to speak to the officer in  charge, and a young man put his head over the truck. Matthews then told  him that several hundred Boers were awaiting the train, strongly  entrenched, and that the metals were up for about three-quarters of a  mile. \"Is that all?\" was the answer;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14470"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 12 (#12)"],[1,"today, after all.    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. They are very modest nice men.    BOLZ. You can't imagine how glad I am that our good fortune brought us  into such pleasant company. For although in there everything is very  prettily arranged--    PIEPENBRINK. It really is all very creditable.    BOLZ. Very creditable! But yet this political society is not to my  taste.    PIEPENBRINK. Ah, indeed! You don't belong to the party, I suppose, and  on that account do not like it.    BOLZ. It's not that! But when I reflect that all these people have  been invited, not really to heartily enjoy themselves, but in order  that they shall presently give their votes to this or that gentleman,  it cools my ardor.    PIEPENBRINK. Oh, it can hardly be meant just that way. Something could  be said on the other side--don't you think so, comrade?    KLEINMICHEL. I trust no one will be asked to sign any agreement here.    BOLZ. Perhaps not. I have no vote to cast and I am proud to be in a  company where nothing else is thought of but enjoying oneself with  one's neighbor and paying attention to the queens of society--to  charming women! Touch glasses, gentlemen, to the health of the ladies,  of the two who adorn our circle. [_All touch glasses_.]    PIEPENBRINK. Come here, Lottie, your health is being drunk.    BOLZ. Young lady, allow a stranger to drink to your future prosperity.      PIEPENBRINK. What else do you suppose they are going to do in there?    FRITZ KLEINMICHEL. I hear that at supper there are to be speeches, and  the candidate for election, Colonel Berg, is to be introduced.    PIEPENBRINK. A very estimable gentleman.    KLEINMICHEL. Yes, it is a good choice the gentlemen on the committee  have made.    ADELAIDE, _who has been visible in the rear, now saunters in_.    ADELAIDE. He sitting here? What sort of a company is that?    KAeMPE. People say that Professor Oldendorf has a good chance of  election. Many are said to be going to vote for him.    PIEPENBRINK. I have nothing to say against him, only to my mind he is  too young.    SENDEN _is seen in the rear, later_ BLUMENBERG _and guests_.    SENDEN. You here, Miss Runeck?    ADELAIDE. I'm amusing myself with watching those queer people. They  act as though the rest of the company were non-existent.    SENDEN. What do I see? There sits the _Union_ itself and next to one  of the most important personages of the fete!    [_The music ceases_.]    BOLZ (_who has meanwhile been conversing with_ MRS. PIEPENBRINK _but  has listened attentively--to_ MR. PIEPENBRINK). There, you see the  gentlemen cannot desist from talking politics after all. (_To_  PIEPENBRINK.) Did you not mention Professor Oldendorf?    PIEPENBRINK. Yes, my jolly Doctor, just casually.    BOLZ. When you talk of him I heartily pray you to say good things  about him; for he is the best, the noblest man I know.    PIEPENBRINK. Indeed? You know him?    KLEINMICHEL. Are you possibly a friend of his!    BOLZ. More than that. Were the professor to say to me today: \"Bolz, it  will help me to have you jump into the water,\" I should have to jump  in, unpleasant as it would be to me just at this moment to drown in  water.    PIEPENBRINK. Oho! That is strong!    BOLZ. In this company I have no right to speak of candidates for  election. But if I did have a member to elect he should be the  one--he, first of all.    PIEPENBRINK. But you are very much prejudiced in the man's favor.    BOLZ. His political views do not concern me here at all. But what do I  demand of a member? That he be a man; that he have a warm heart and a  sure judgment, and that he know unwaveringly and unquestionably what  is good and right; furthermore, that he have the strength to do what  he knows to be right without delay, without hesitation.    PIEPENBRINK. Bravo!    KLEINMICHEL. But the Colonel, too, is said to be that kind of a man.    BOLZ. Possibly he is, I do not know; but of Oldendorf I know it. I  looked straight into his heart on the occasion of an unpleasant  experience I went through. I was once on the point of burning to  powder when he was kind enough to prevent it. Him I have to thank for  sitting here. He saved my life.    SENDEN. He lies abominably!    [_Starts forward_.]    ADELAIDE (_holding him back_). Be still! I believe there is some truth  to the story.    PIEPENBRINK. Well now, it was very fine of him to save your life; but  that kind of thing often happens.    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. Do tell us about it, Doctor!    BOLZ. The little affair is like a hundred others and would not  interest me at all, had I not been through it myself. Picture to  yourself an old house. I am a student living on the third floor. In  the house opposite me lives a young scholar; we do not know each  other. At dead of night I am awakened by a great noise and a strange  crackling under me. If it were mice, they must have been having a  torchlight procession for the room was brilliantly illuminated. I rush  to the window, the bright flame from the story under me leaps up to  where I stand. My window-panes burst about my head, and a vile cloud  of smoke rushes in on me. There being no great pleasure under the  circumstances in leaning out of the window, I rush to the door and  throw it open. The stairs, too, cannot resist the mean impulse  peculiar to old wood, they are all ablaze. Up three flights of stairs  and no exit! I gave myself up for lost. Half unconscious I hurried  back to the window. I heard the cries from the street, \"A man! a man!  This way with the ladder!\" A ladder was set up. In an instant it began  to smoke and to burn like tinder. It was dragged away. Then streams of  water from all the engines hissed in the flames beneath me. Distinctly  I could hear each separate stream striking the glowing wall. A fresh  ladder was put up; below there was deathly silence and you can imagine  that I, too, had no desire to make much of a commotion in my fiery  furnace. \"It can't be done,\" cried the people below. Then a full, rich  voice rang out: \"Raise the ladder higher!\" Do you know, I felt  instantly that this was the voice of my rescuer. \"Hurry!\" cried those  below. Then a fresh cloud of vapor penetrated the room. I had had my  share of the thick smoke, and lay prostrate on the ground by the  window.    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. Poor Doctor Bolz!    PIEPENBRINK (_eagerly_). Go on!    [SENDEN _starts forward_.]    ADELAIDE (_holding him back_). Please, let him finish, the story is  true!    BOLZ. Then a man's hand seizes my neck. A rope is wound round me under  the arms, and a strong wrist raises me from the ground. A moment later  I was on the ladder, half dragged, half carried; with shirt aflame,  and unconscious, I reached the pavement.--I awoke in the room of the  young scholar. Save for a few slight burns, I had brought nothing with  me over into the new apartment; all my belongings were burned. The  stranger nursed me and cared for me like a brother. Not until I was  able to go out again did I learn that this scholar was the same man  who had paid his visit to me that night on the ladder. You see the man  has his heart in the right spot, and that's why I wish him now to  become member of Parliament, and why I could do for him what I would  not do for myself; for him I could electioneer, intrigue, or make  fools of honest people. That man is Professor Oldendorf.    PIEPENBRINK. Well, he's a tremendously fine man! [_Rising_.] Here's to  the health of Professor Oldendorf! [_All rise and touch glasses_.]    BOLZ (_bowing pleasantly to all--to_ MRS. PIEPENBRINK). I see warm  sympathy shining in your eyes, dear madam, and I thank you for it. Mr.  Piepenbrink, I ask permission to shake your hand; you are a fine  fellow. [_Slaps him on the back and embraces him_.] Give me your hand,  Mr. Kleinmichel! [_Embraces him_.] And you, too, Mr. Fritz  Kleinmichel! May no child of yours ever sit in the fire, but if he  does may there ever be a gallant man at hand to pull him out. Come  nearer, I must embrace you, too.    MRS. PIEPENBRINK (_much moved_). Piepenbrink, we have veal-cutlets  tomorrow. What do you think? [_Converses with him in a low tone_.]    ADELAIDE. His spirits are running away with him!    SENDEN. He is unbearable! I see that you are as indignant as I am. He  snatches away our people; it can no longer be endured.    BOLZ (_who had gone the rounds of table, returning and standing in  front of_ MRS. PIEPENBRINK). It really isn't right to let it stop  here. Mr. Piepenbrink, head of the house, I appeal to you, I ask your  permission--hand or mouth?    ADELAIDE (_horrified, on the right toward the front_). He is actually  kissing her!    PIEPENBRINK. Sail in, old man, courage!    MRS. PIEPENBRINK. Piepenbrink, I no longer know you!    ADELAIDE (_at the moment when_ BOLZ _is about to kiss_ MRS.  PIEPENBRINK _crosses the stage, passing them casually, as it were, and  holds her bouquet between_ BOLZ _and_ MRS. PIEPENBRINK. _In a low  tone, quickly to_ BOLZ). You're going too far! You are being watched!    [_Passes to the rear on the left, and exit_.]    BOLZ. A fairy interferes!    SENDEN _(who has already been haranguing some of the other guests,  including_ BLUMENBERG, _noisily pushes forward at this moment--to  those at the table_). He is presumptuous; he has thrust himself in!    PIEPENBRINK (_bringing down his hand on the table and rising_). Oho! I  like that! If I kiss my wife or let her be kissed, that is nobody's  concern whatever! Nobody's! No man and no woman and no fairy has a  right to put a hand before her mouth.    BOLZ. Very true! Splendid! Hear! Hear!    SENDEN. Revered Mr. Piepenbrink, no offense against you! The company  is charmed to see you here. Only to Mr. Bolz we will remark that his  presence is causing scandal. So completely opposed are his political  principles that we must regard his appearing at this fete as an  unwarrantable intrusion!    BOLZ. My political principles opposed?
