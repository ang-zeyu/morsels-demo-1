The walls are thin, and  the winds of winter blow through them piteously, and if a man and his  wife should unfortunately \"have words\" (the pleasing country euphemism  for a violent quarrel) all their neighbours can hear them. The scenery  is utterly spoilt by these ugly eyesores. Villas at Hindhead seem to  have broken out upon the once majestic hill like a red skin eruption.  The jerry-built villa is invading our heaths and pine-woods; every  street in our towns is undergoing improvement; we are covering whole  counties with houses. In Lancashire no sooner does one village end its  mean streets than another begins. London is ever enlarging itself,  extending its great maw over all the country round. The Rev. Canon  Erskine Clarke, Vicar of Battersea, when he first came to reside near  Clapham Junction, remembers the green fields and quiet lanes with  trees on each side that are now built over. The street leading from  the station lined with shops forty years ago had hedges and trees on  each side. There were great houses situated in beautiful gardens and  parks wherein resided some of the great City merchants, county  families, the leaders in old days of the influential \"Clapham sect.\"  These gardens and parks have been covered with streets and rows of  cottages and villas; some of the great houses have been pulled down  and others turned into schools or hospitals, valued only at the rent  of the land on which they stand. All this is inevitable. You cannot  stop all this any more than Mrs. Partington could stem the Atlantic  tide with a housemaid's mop. But ere the flood has quite swallowed up  all that remains of England's natural and architectural beauties, it  may be useful to glance at some of the buildings that remain in town  and country ere they have quite vanished.    [Illustration: Mill Street, Warwick]    Beneath the shade of the lordly castle of Warwick, which has played  such an important part in the history of England, the town of Warwick  sprang into existence, seeking protection in lawless times from its  strong walls and powerful garrison. Through its streets often rode  in state the proud rulers of the castle with their men-at-arms--the  Beauchamps, the Nevilles, including the great \"King-maker,\" Richard  Neville, the Dudleys, and the Grevilles. They contributed to the  building of their noble castle, protected the town, and were borne to  their last resting-place in the fine church, where their tombs remain.  The town has many relics of its lords, and possesses many  half-timbered graceful houses. Mill Street is one of the most  picturesque groups of old-time dwellings, a picture that lingers in  our minds long after we have left the town and fortress of the grim  old Earls of Warwick.    Oxford is a unique city. There is no place like it in the world.  Scholars of Cambridge, of course, will tell me that I am wrong, and  that the town on the Cam is a far superior place, and then point  triumphantly to \"the backs.\" Yes, they are very beautiful, but as a  loyal son of Oxford I may be allowed to prefer that stately city with  its towers and spires, its wealth of college buildings, its exquisite  architecture unrivalled in the world. Nor is the new unworthy of the  old. The buildings at Magdalen, at Brazenose, and even the New Schools  harmonize not unseemly with the ancient structures. Happily Keble is  far removed from the heart of the city, so that that somewhat  unsatisfactory, unsuccessful pile of brickwork interferes not with its  joy. In the streets and lanes of modern Oxford we can search for and  discover many types of old-fashioned, humble specimens of domestic  art, and we give as an illustration some houses which date back to  Tudor times, but have, alas! been recently demolished.    [Illustration: Tudor Tenements, New Inn Hall St, Oxford. Now  demolished]    Many conjectures have been made as to the reason why our forefathers  preferred to rear their houses with the upper storeys projecting out  into the streets. We can understand that in towns where space was  limited it would be an advantage to increase the size of the upper  rooms, if one did not object to the lack of air in the narrow street  and the absence of sunlight. But we find these same projecting storeys  in the depth of the country, where there could have been no  restriction as to the ground to be occupied by the house. Possibly the  fashion was first established of necessity in towns, and the  traditional mode of building was continued in the country. Some say  that by this means our ancestors tried to protect the lower part of  the house, the foundations, from the influence of the weather; others  with some ingenuity suggest that these projecting storeys were  intended to form a covered walk for passengers in the streets, and to  protect them from the showers of slops which the careless housewife of  Elizabethan times cast recklessly from the upstairs windows.  Architects tell us that it was purely a matter of construction. Our  forefathers used to place four strong corner-posts, framed from the  trunks of oak trees, firmly sunk into the ground with their roots left  on and placed upward, the roots curving outwards so as to form  supports for the upper storeys. These curved parts, and often the  posts also, were often elaborately carved and ornamented, as in the  example which our artist gives us of a corner-post of a house in  Ipswich.    In _The Charm of the English Village_ I have tried to describe the  methods of the construction of these timber-framed houses,[11] and it  is perhaps unnecessary for me to repeat what is there recorded. In  fact, there were three types of these dwelling-places, to which have  been given the names Post and Pan, Transom Framed, and Intertie Work.  In judging of the age of a house it will be remembered that the nearer  together the upright posts are placed the older the house is. The  builders as time went on obtained greater confidence, set their posts  wider apart, and held them together by transoms.      [11] _The Charm of the English Village_, pp. 50-7.    [Illustration: Gothic Corner-post. The Half Moon Inn, Ipswich]    Surrey is a county of good cottages and farm-houses, and these have  had their chroniclers in Miss Gertrude Jekyll's delightful _Old West  Surrey_ and in the more technical work of Mr. Ralph Nevill, F.S.A. The  numerous works on cottage and farm-house building published by Mr.  Batsford illustrate the variety of styles that prevailed in different  counties, and which are mainly attributable to the variety in the  local materials in the counties. Thus in the Cotswolds,  Northamptonshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Westmorland, Somersetshire,  and elsewhere there is good building-stone; and there we find charming  examples of stone-built cottages and farm-houses, altogether  satisfying. In several counties where there is little stone and large  forests of timber we find the timber-framed dwelling flourishing in  all its native beauty. In Surrey there are several materials for  building, hence there is a charming diversity of domiciles. Even the  same building sometimes shows walls of stone and brick, half-timber  and plaster, half-timber and tile-hanging, half-timber with panels  filled with red brick, and roofs of thatch or tiles, or stone slates  which the Horsham quarries supplied.    [Illustration: Timber-built House, Shrewsbury]    [Illustration]    These Surrey cottages have changed with age. Originally they were  built with timber frames, the panels being filled in with wattle and  daub, but the storms of many winters have had their effect upon the  structure. Rain drove through the walls, especially when the ends of  the wattle rotted a little, and draughts were strong enough to blow  out the rushlights and to make the house very uncomfortable. Oak  timbers often shrink. Hence the joints came apart, and being exposed  to the weather became decayed. In consequence of this the buildings  settled, and new methods had to be devised to make them weather-proof.  The villages therefore adopted two or three means in order to attain  this end. They plastered the whole surface of the walls on the  outside, or they hung them with deal boarding or covered them with  tiles. In Surrey tile-hung houses are more common than in any other  part of the country. This use of weather-tiles is not very ancient,  probably not earlier than 1750, and much of this work was done in that  century or early in the nineteenth. Many of these tile-hung houses are  the old sixteenth-century timber-framed structures in a new shell.  Weather-tiles are generally flatter and thinner than those used for  roofing, and when bedded in mortar make a thoroughly weather-proof  wall. Sometimes they are nailed to boarding, but the former plan makes  the work more durable, though the courses are not so regular. These  tiles have various shapes, of which the commonest is semicircular,  resembling a fish-scale. The same form with a small square shoulder is  very generally used, but there is a great variety, and sometimes those  with ornamental ends are blended with plain ones. Age imparts a very  beautiful colour to old tiles, and when covered with lichen they  assume a charming appearance which artists love to depict.    The mortar used in these old buildings is very strong and good. In  order to strengthen the mortar used in Sussex and Surrey houses and  elsewhere, the process of \"galleting\" or \"garreting\" was adopted. The  brick-layers used to decorate the rather wide and uneven mortar joint  with small pieces of black ironstone stuck into the mortar. Sussex was  once famous for its ironwork, and ironstone is found in plenty near  the surface of the ground in this district. \"Galleting\" dates back to  Jacobean times, and is not to be found in sixteenth-century work.    Sussex houses are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#12)"],[1,"of this Committee to make an appraisal of the tenets implicit  in any of them. Ecclesiastics may preach against the sins involved;  opposition may arise to the philosophy of education; commercial and  professional interests may inveigh against the inroads of the State, but  this Committee is concerned only in their effects on the sexual  behaviour of young people whose habits and characters are being  affected. It is now necessary to examine them.      =(1) Contraceptives=    Perhaps the first major shock to \"respectable\" society regarding sex was  when it became known, soon after the beginning of the First World War,  that the Army authorities were distributing \"condoms\" to troops about to  go on leave. Probably this was the first recognition by the New Zealand  Government of contraceptives. This decision by the Army was accepted by  society, not without misgivings, on the basis that it was much more  important to guard against the spread of venereal disease than to  endeavour to enforce continence among the troops. Society was obliged to  choose between two evils, and it chose what it regarded as the lesser.  Contraceptives thereafter came into common use, are now purchased by a  majority of married couples, and by many unmarried persons. Their  acceptance by the married has posed some problems which have required  the attention of the Courts in England. It was not foreseen, when they  came into use, that questions would arise as to the validity of certain  marriages where one party used contraceptives to avoid having children.    The Committee has found a strong public demand that contraceptives  should not be allowed to get into the hands of children and adolescents.  Whatever views may be held concerning the use of contraceptives by older  people (married or unmarried) no responsible father or mother would  countenance their possession by their young sons and daughters.    The Committee is unanimous that adolescents should not buy or have  contraceptives in their possession.      =(2) The Broadening of the Divorce Laws=    The subject of divorce was very fully discussed in the Houses of  Parliament in England, in New Zealand, and elsewhere after the First  World War.    If parents are unable to live happy lives together or to become  reconciled after differences have arisen, the interests of the children  may be improved, or may be worsened, by a legal separation or a divorce.  Tension in the home may be just as big a factor in the causation of  delinquency as a divorce or separation of the spouses.    Juvenile delinquency in all its forms is frequently associated with  homes where the marriage is broken either by a divorce, separation, or  discord. It is not so much the separation as the tension which precedes  and succeeds it that results in children getting out of control.    The matter is noted here solely because, if parents cannot agree  together, they are less likely to discharge their duties to their  children. Greater is the responsibility which rests upon them in these  unhappy circumstances. If parents are unwilling to shoulder the extra  burden caused by the break-down of their marriage, some action by the  State may be required if it seems likely that children may suffer.      =(3) Pre-marital Relations=    One aspect of the moral drift is the number of people who entertain the  nebulous idea that it is somehow not wrong to have pre-marital relations  or to live together as man and wife without marriage.    Such a view is opposed to all the ideas of chastity which are inherent  in our morality. Apart from that, an irregular sex relationship may be  psychologically[6] disadvantageous.    However much adults may desire a good moral standard to be observed by  children and adolescents, they have no right to expect it unless they  conform to proper moral standards themselves.      =(4) \"Self-expression\" in Children=    Early in this century psychologists said that the repressive influences  of early discipline were stultifying to the development of the child.  They advocated that the child's personality would mature better if  uninhibited. This has been interpreted by many people to mean that you  should not use corrective measures in the upbringing of children and  that their natural impulses must not be suppressed. Some of these people  have even thought it wrong to say \"No\" to a child.    People brought up in this way have now become parents. It is difficult  for them to adopt an attitude to their children which does not go to  extremes either way. As a revolt against their own upbringing, they are  either too firm in their control or too lax. Children brought up in both  of these ways have been featured in the case notes of delinquent  children placed before the Committee.      =(5) Materialistic Concepts in Society=    Education, medical and hospital treatment, industrial insurance,  sickness and age benefits, and other things are all provided by the  State, when the need arises, without direct charge upon the individual.  The virtues of thrift and self-denial have been disappearing. Incentive  does not have the place in our economy which it used to have. The  tendency has been to turn to the State for the supply of all material  needs. By encouraging parents to rely upon the State their sense of  responsibility for the upbringing of their children has been diminished.  The adolescent of today has been born into a world where things  temporal, such as money values and costs, are discussed much more than  spiritual things. The weekly \"child's allowance\" is regarded by some  children as their own perquisite from the benevolent Government.    The dangers inherent in this materialistic view is that many young  people who could profit from further education do not feel a sufficient  inducement to continue study. They leave school too soon, and the  broadening influences which could come from further education in the  daytime, or the evenings, is lost to them. In the result, these young  people, having too much interest in material things, and not enough in  the things of the mind and the spirit, become a potential source of  trouble in the community.    One suggestion made to the Committee was that saving and thrift should  be encouraged, or that this might be enforced through the Children's  Court in cases where it is found that offenders have fallen into  criminal immorality through having more money than suffices to pay the  reasonable necessaries of life. While the powers of the Children's Court  might be extended or used for this purpose in extreme cases where  adolescents are brought before the Court, the best help can come from  wise action by parents to prevent their powers of direction and control  being undermined through young persons having too much freedom and too  many of the material things which are not necessary for their  well-being.          _XV. The Law and Morality_      =(1) History of the Law Regarding Morality=    At no time in the history of the British Commonwealth have Parliaments  or the law-courts endeavoured to impose a system or code of morality on  the people. Men are not required by the governing powers to observe the  moral law, any more than they are required to attend Divine worship. But  Parliament, in the shaping of legislation, and the Judges in the  administration of justice, have frequently had regard to that  indefinable sense of right and wrong which becomes implanted in the  human breast. Furthermore, the law, while not coercing any one into  following a particular course of moral conduct, has, nevertheless,  always been careful to restrain people from acting in such a way as may  cause offence to those who do observe the principles of religion or of  morality.    Offences against religion (for example, blasphemy and disturbing public  worship), and offences against decency and morality (for example,  indecent exposure, indecent publications, and prostitution) are strongly  reprehended.    In determining what conduct on the part of an individual should be  condemned the law has always endeavoured to maintain a balance between  freedom of the individual and the rights of the community not to be  harmed by the exercise of that freedom.    The law is not interested in sin, or even immorality, but it is vitally  interested in the effects of them. A person may stay away from church,  but he must not scoff at the Holy Scriptures. He may bathe in the nude,  but not at a public beach or near where persons are passing. A human  model may be posed for an artist, but must not be exhibited in a shop  window.    One other feature of the law regarding morals is that there are some  things which adults are not restrained from doing but which the law will  not suffer to be done by minors. Common examples are found in the  restraints which are imposed on children smoking, or entering upon  premises open for \"drinking\" or betting.    Similarly, through reason and experience, the law has found it necessary  to set some limits on the right of an individual to do what he likes  with his own person. The community has an interest in the life of every  citizen. More particularly may this be said to be so when the State  spends much money on the education and health of the people. Suicide  has always been wrongful; attempts at suicide are therefore punishable,  partly because the State has an interest in maintaining human life, and  partly because suicide is a result of sin and a breach of morality.      =(2) Protection of Women and Girls from Defilement=    At common law the woman was always regarded as the mistress of her own  person. Consent was therefore a defence to a charge of rape. The  Legislature subsequently interfered for the good of society and in the  interests of morality by legislating against abortion, against  soliciting for the purpose of prostitution, against the keeping of  brothels, and against procuration for the purpose of carnal knowledge."]]]
