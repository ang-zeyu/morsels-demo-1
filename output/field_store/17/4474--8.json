(#12)"],[1," Any inclination that may be felt for obtaining an appearance of greater  accuracy by ignoring the last result must be resisted. For, although it  would make no practical difference whether the mean standard is taken as  0.2961 or 0.2963, it is well not to ignore the possibility that an error  of 0.4 c.c. may arise. A result should only be ignored when the cause of  its variation is known.    In this series the results are proportional, but the range of weights  (0.216-0.2555 gram) is small. All processes yield fairly proportional  results if the quantities vary within narrow limits.    As to results which are not proportional, it is best to take some  imaginary examples, and then to apply the lesson to an actual one. A  series of titrations of a copper solution by means of a solution of  potassic cyanide gave the following results:--      +---------------+---------------+-----------+    | Copper taken. | Cyanide used. | Standard. |    +---------------+---------------+-----------+    |   0.1 gram    |   11.9 c.c.   |   0.8403  |    |   0.2  \"      |   23.7  \"     |   0.8438  |    |   0.3  \"      |   35.6  \"     |   0.8426  |    |   0.4  \"      |   47.6  \"     |   0.8403  |    +---------------+---------------+-----------+    These are proportional, but by using a larger quantity of acid and  ammonia in the work preliminary to titration, we might have had to use  1 c.c. of cyanide solution more in each case before the finishing point  was reached. The results would then have been:      +---------------+---------------+-----------+    | Copper taken. | Cyanide used. | Standard. |    +---------------+---------------+-----------|    |    0.1 gram   |   12.9 c.c.   |   0.7752  |    |    0.2   \"    |   24.7  \"     |   0.8097  |    |    0.3   \"    |   36.6  \"     |   0.8191  |    |    0.4   \"    |   48.6  \"     |   0.8230  |    +---------------+---------------+-----------+    It will be noted that the value of the standard increases with the  weight of metal used; and calculations from the mean standard will be  incorrect.    By subtracting the lowest standardising from the highest, a third result  is got free from any error common to the other two; thus:--        0.4 gram = 48.6 c.c. \"cyanide.\"      0.1  \"   = 12.9   \"     \"      ---        ----      0.3  \"   = 35.7   \"     \"    And the standard calculated from this corrected result is 0.8404.  Further, if 0.3 gram requires 35.7 c.c., then 0.1 gram should require  11.9 c.c., or 1.0 c.c. less than that actually found.    We may therefore use the following rules for working processes which do  not yield proportional results. Make a series of two or three  titrations, using very different quantities of metal in each. Subtract  the lowest of these from the highest, and calculate the standard with  the remainder. Calculate the volume required by this standard in any  case, and find the excess or deficit, as the case may be. If an excess,  subtract it from the result of each titration; if a deficit, add it; and  use the standard in the usual way. The following table shows an actual  example:--      +--------------+---------------+-----------+    | Chalk taken. | Gas obtained. | Standard. |    +--------------+---------------+-----------+    |  0.0873 gram |   17.8 c.c.   |  0.4904   |    |  0.1305  \"   |   27.3  \"     |  0.4780   |    |  0.1690  \"   |   35.8  \"     |  0.4721   |    |  0.1905  \"   |   40.4  \"     |  0.4715   |    |  0.2460  \"   |   52.5  \"     |  0.4686   |    |  0.3000  \"   |   64.0  \"     |  0.4687   |    +--------------+---------------+-----------+    It will be seen that the standard decreases as the quantity of chalk  increases; this points to a deficiency in the quantity of gas evolved.    Then        0.3000 = 64.0 c.c.      0.0873 = 17.8  \"      ------ = ----      0.2127 = 46.2  \"    and 0.2127×100/46.2 = 0.4604. Then, multiplying the weight of chalk  taken by 100, and dividing by 0.4604, we get the calculated results of  the following table:--      +--------------+------------+-----------------+-------------+    | Chalk taken. | Gas found. | Gas calculated. | Difference. |    +--------------+------------+-----------------+-------------+    | 0.0873 gram  | 17.8 c.c.  |    18.9 c.c.    | -1.1 c.c.   |    | 0.1305  \"    | 27.3  \"    |    28.3  \"      | -1.0  \"     |    | 0.1690  \"    | 35.8  \"    |    36.7  \"      | -0.9  \"     |    | 0.1905  \"    | 40.4  \"    |    41.4  \"      | -1.0  \"     |    | 0.2460  \"    | 52.5  \"    |    53.4  \"      | -0.9  \"     |    | 0.3000  \"    | 64.0  \"    |    65.1  \"      | -1.1  \"     |    +--------------+------------+-----------------+-------------+    By adding 1 c.c. to the quantity of gas obtained, and taking 0.4604 as  the standard, the calculated results will agree with those found with a  variation of 0.1 c.c. When a large number of assays of the same kind are  being made, this method of calculation is convenient; when, however,  only one or two determinations are in question, it is easier to make a  couple of standardisings, taking quantities as nearly as possible the  same as those present in the assays.    Sometimes it is necessary to draw up a table which will show, without  calculation, the weight of substance equivalent to a given volume of gas  or of solution. The substance used for standardising should be, whenever  possible, a pure sample of the substance to be determined--that is, for  copper assays pure copper should be used, for iron assays pure iron, and  so on; but when this cannot be got an impure substance may be used,  provided it contains a known percentage of the metal, and that the  impurities present are not such as will interfere with the accuracy of  the assay. Including compounds with these, the standard may be  calculated by multiplying the standard got in the usual way, by the  percentage of metal in the compound or impure substance, and dividing by  100. If, for example, the standard 1.008 gram was obtained by using a  sample of iron containing 99.7 per cent. of metal, the corrected  standard would be 1.008×99.7/100 = 1.005.    In volumetric analysis the change brought about must be one in which the  end of the reaction is rendered prominent either by a change of colour  or by the presence or absence of a precipitate. If the end of the  reaction or finishing-point is not of itself visible, then it must be  rendered visible by the use of a third reagent called an indicator.    For example, the action of sulphuric acid upon soda results in nothing  which makes the action conspicuous; if, however, litmus or  phenolphthalein be added the change from blue to red in the first case,  or from red to colourless in the second, renders the finishing-point  evident. Some indicators cannot be added to the assay solution without  spoiling the result; in which case portions of the assay solution must  be withdrawn from time to time and tested. This withdrawal of portions  of the assay solution, if rashly done, must result in loss; if, however,  the solution is not concentrated, and if the portions are only withdrawn  towards the end of the titration, the loss is very trifling, and will  not show-up on the result. The usual plan adopted is to have a solution  of the indicator placed in drops at fairly equal intervals distributed  over a clean and dry white porcelain-plate: a drop or two of the  solution to be tested is then brought in contact with one of these and  the effect noted. Another plan is to have thin blotting-paper, moistened  with a solution of the indicator and dried; a drop of the solution to be  tested placed on this shows the characteristic change. When the assay  solution contains a suspended solid which interferes with the test, a  prepared paper covered with an ordinary filter-paper answers very well;  a drop of the solution to be tested is placed on the filter-paper, and,  sinking through, shows its effect on the paper below.    Except when otherwise stated, all titrations should be made at the  ordinary temperature; cooling, if necessary, by holding the flask under  the tap. When a titration is directed to be made in a boiling solution,  it must be remembered that the standard solution is cold, and that every  addition lowers the temperature of the assay.    On running the solution from the burette into the assay, do not let it  run down the side of the flask. If a portion of the assay has to be  withdrawn for testing, shake the flask to ensure mixing, and then take  out a drop with the test-rod; the neglect of these precautions may give  a finishing-point too early. This is generally indicated by a sudden  finish, in which case on shaking the flask and again testing no reaction  is got. Do not remove the drop on the point of the burette with the  test-rod; let it remain where it is or drop it into the solution by  carefully opening the clip.    Generally the methods of working are as follows:--    (1) _When the finishing-point depends on a change of colour in the  solution._--Increase the bulk of the assay up to from 100 to 150 c.c.  with water. Boil or cool, as the case may be. Run in the standard  solution from a burette speedily, until the re-agent appears to have a  slower action, and shake or stir all the time. Then run 1 c.c. or so at  a time, still stirring, and finally add drops until the colour change is  got.    (2) _When an outside-indicator is used._--Pour the standard solution  from a burette into the assay until 5 or 6 c.c. from the  finishing-point; then run in 1 c.c. at a time (stirring and testing on  the plate between each) until the indicator shows the change wanted, and  deduct 0.5 c.c. for excess. When greater accuracy is sought for a  duplicate assay is made. In this case the standard solution is run in  close up to the end, and the operation is finished off with a few drops  at a time.    (3) _Where the finishing-point depends upon the absence of a precipitate  and no outside-indicator is used._--As in the last case, run in the  standard solution up to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18755"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part II-II (Secunda Secundae) (#12)"],[1,"external works are not reckoned acts of faith. Therefore  neither is confession an act of faith.    _On the contrary,_ A gloss explains the words of 2 Thess. 1:11, \"and  the work of faith in power\" as referring to \"confession which is a  work proper to faith.\"    _I answer that,_ Outward actions belong properly to the virtue to  whose end they are specifically referred: thus fasting is referred  specifically to the end of abstinence, which is to tame the flesh,  and consequently it is an act of abstinence.    Now confession of those things that are of faith is referred  specifically as to its end, to that which concerns faith, according  to 2 Cor. 4:13: \"Having the same spirit of faith . . . we believe,  and therefore we speak also.\" For the outward utterance is intended  to signify the inward thought. Wherefore, just as the inward thought  of matters of faith is properly an act of faith, so too is the  outward confession of them.    Reply Obj. 1: A threefold confession is commended by the Scriptures.  One is the confession of matters of faith, and this is a proper act  of faith, since it is referred to the end of faith as stated above.  Another is the confession of thanksgiving or praise, and this is an  act of \"latria,\" for its purpose is to give outward honor to God,  which is the end of \"latria.\" The third is the confession of sins,  which is ordained to the blotting out of sins, which is the end of  penance, to which virtue it therefore belongs.    Reply Obj. 2: That which removes an obstacle is not a direct, but an  indirect, cause, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 4). Hence  fortitude which removes an obstacle to the confession of faith, viz.  fear or shame, is not the proper and direct cause of confession, but  an indirect cause so to speak.    Reply Obj. 3: Inward faith, with the aid of charity, causes all  outward acts of virtue, by means of the other virtues, commanding,  but not eliciting them; whereas it produces the act of confession  as its proper act, without the help of any other virtue.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 3, Art. 2]    Whether Confession of Faith Is Necessary for Salvation?    Objection 1: It would seem that confession of faith is not necessary  for salvation. For, seemingly, a thing is sufficient for salvation, if  it is a means of attaining the end of virtue. Now the proper end of  faith is the union of the human mind with Divine truth, and this can  be realized without any outward confession. Therefore confession of  faith is not necessary for salvation.    Obj. 2: Further, by outward confession of faith, a man reveals his  faith to another man. But this is unnecessary save for those who have  to instruct others in the faith. Therefore it seems that the simple  folk are not bound to confess the faith.    Obj. 3: Further, whatever may tend to scandalize and disturb others,  is not necessary for salvation, for the Apostle says (1 Cor. 10:32):  \"Be without offense to the Jews and to the gentiles and to the Church  of God.\" Now confession of faith sometimes causes a disturbance among  unbelievers. Therefore it is not necessary for salvation.    _On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Rom. 10:10): \"With the heart we  believe unto justice; but with the mouth, confession is made unto  salvation.\"    _I answer that,_ Things that are necessary for salvation come under  the precepts of the Divine law. Now since confession of faith is  something affirmative, it can only fall under an affirmative precept.  Hence its necessity for salvation depends on how it falls under an  affirmative precept of the Divine law. Now affirmative precepts as  stated above (I-II, Q. 71, A. 5, ad 3; I-II, Q. 88, A. 1, ad 2) do  not bind for always, although they are always binding; but they bind  as to place and time according to other due circumstances, in respect  of which human acts have to be regulated in order to be acts of  virtue.    Thus then it is not necessary for salvation to confess one's faith at  all times and in all places, but in certain places and at certain  times, when, namely, by omitting to do so, we would deprive God of  due honor, or our neighbor of a service that we ought to render him:  for instance, if a man, on being asked about his faith, were to  remain silent, so as to make people believe either that he is without  faith, or that the faith is false, or so as to turn others away from  the faith; for in such cases as these, confession of faith is  necessary for salvation.    Reply Obj. 1: The end of faith, even as of the other virtues, must  be referred to the end of charity, which is the love of God and our  neighbor. Consequently when God's honor and our neighbor's good  demand, man should not be contented with being united by faith to  God's truth, but ought to confess his faith outwardly.    Reply Obj. 2: In cases of necessity where faith is in danger, every  one is bound to proclaim his faith to others, either to give good  example and encouragement to the rest of the faithful, or to check  the attacks of unbelievers: but at other times it is not the duty  of all the faithful to instruct others in the faith.    Reply Obj. 3: There is nothing commendable in making a public  confession of one's faith, if it causes a disturbance among  unbelievers, without any profit either to the faith or to the  faithful. Hence Our Lord said (Matt. 7:6): \"Give not that which is  holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine . . . lest  turning upon you, they tear you.\" Yet, if there is hope of profit to  the faith, or if there be urgency, a man should disregard the  disturbance of unbelievers, and confess his faith in public. Hence it  is written (Matt. 15:12) that when the disciples had said to Our Lord  that \"the Pharisee, when they heard this word, were scandalized,\" He  answered: \"Let them alone, they are blind, and leaders of the blind.\"  _______________________    QUESTION 4    OF THE VIRTUE ITSELF OF FAITH  (In Eight Articles)    We must now consider the virtue itself of faith, and, in the first  place, faith itself; secondly, those who have faith; thirdly, the  cause of faith; fourthly, its effects.    Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) What is faith?    (2) In what power of the soul does it reside?    (3) Whether its form is charity?    (4) Whether living (_formata_) faith and lifeless (_informis_) faith  are one identically?    (5) Whether faith is a virtue?    (6) Whether it is one virtue?    (7) Of its relation to the other virtues;    (8) Of its certitude as compared with the certitude of the  intellectual virtues.  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 1]    Whether This Is a Fitting Definition of Faith: \"Faith Is the  Substance of Things to Be Hoped For, the Evidence of Things That  Appear Not?\"    Objection 1: It would seem that the Apostle gives an unfitting  definition of faith (Heb. 11:1) when he says: \"Faith is the substance  of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.\"  For no quality is a substance: whereas faith is a quality, since it  is a theological virtue, as stated above (I-II, Q. 62, A. 3).  Therefore it is not a substance.    Obj. 2: Further, different virtues have different objects. Now things  to be hoped for are the object of hope. Therefore they should not be  included in a definition of faith, as though they were its object.    Obj. 3: Further, faith is perfected by charity rather than by hope,  since charity is the form of faith, as we shall state further on (A.  3). Therefore the definition of faith should have included the thing  to be loved rather than the thing to be hoped for.    Obj. 4: Further, the same thing should not be placed in different  genera. Now \"substance\" and \"evidence\" are different genera, and  neither is subalternate to the other. Therefore it is unfitting to  state that faith is both \"substance\" and \"evidence.\"    Obj. 5: Further, evidence manifests the truth of the matter for which  it is adduced. Now a thing is said to be apparent when its truth is  already manifest. Therefore it seems to imply a contradiction to  speak of \"evidence of things that appear not\": and so faith is  unfittingly defined.    _On the contrary,_ The authority of the Apostle suffices.    _I answer that,_ Though some say that the above words of the Apostle are  not a definition of faith, yet if we consider the matter aright, this  definition overlooks none of the points in reference to which faith  can be defined, albeit the words themselves are not arranged in the  form of a definition, just as the philosophers touch on the principles  of the syllogism, without employing the syllogistic form.    In order to make this clear, we must observe that since habits are  known by their acts, and acts by their objects, faith, being a habit,  should be defined by its proper act in relation to its proper object.  Now the act of faith is to believe, as stated above (Q. 2, AA. 2, 3),  which is an act of the intellect determinate to one object of the  will's command. Hence an act of faith is related both to the object  of the will, i.e. to the good and the end, and to the object of the  intellect, i.e. to the true. And since faith, through being a  theological virtue, as stated above (I-II, Q. 62, A. 2), has one same  thing for object and end, its object and end must, of necessity, be  in proportion to one another. Now it has been already stated (Q. 1,  AA. 1, 4) that the object of faith is the First Truth, as unseen, and  whatever we hold on account thereof: so that it must needs be under  the aspect of something unseen that the First Truth is the end of the  act of faith, which aspect is that of a thing hoped for, according to  the Apostle (Rom. 8:25): \"We hope for that which we see not\": because  to see the truth is to possess it. Now one hopes not for what one has  already, but for what one has not, as stated above (I-II, Q. 67, A.  4). Accordingly the relation"]]]
