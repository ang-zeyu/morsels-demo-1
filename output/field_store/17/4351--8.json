But she did not hear him: she seemed to be listening to the pain which  the stones in her boots gave her.    \"Good morrow, ma'am,\" said the Philosopher again.    This time she heard him and replied, turning her old, bleared eyes  slowly in his direction-\"Good morrow to yourself, sir,\" said she, and  the Philosopher thought her old face was a very kindly one.    \"What is it that is wrong with you, ma'am?\" said he.    \"It's my boots, sir,\" she replied. \"Full of stones they are, the way I  can hardly walk at all, God help me!\"    \"Why don't you shake them out?\"    \"Ah, sure, I couldn't be bothered, sir, for there are so many holes in  the boots that more would get in before I could take two steps, and an  old woman can't be always fidgeting, God help her!\"    There was a little house on one side of the road, and when the old woman  saw this place she brightened up a little.    \"Do you know who lives in that house?\" said the Philosopher.    \"I do not,\" she replied, \"but it's a real nice house with clean windows  and a shiny knocker on the door, and smoke in the chimney--I wonder  would herself give me a cup of tea now if I asked her--A poor old  woman walking the roads on a stick! and maybe a bit of meat, or an egg  perhaps....\"    \"You could ask,\" suggested the Philosopher gently.    \"Maybe I will, too,\" said she, and she sat down by the road just outside  the house and the Philosopher also sat down.    A little puppy dog came from behind the house and approached them  cautiously. Its intentions were friendly but it had already found that  amicable advances are sometimes indifferently received, for, as it drew  near, it wagged its dubious tail and rolled humbly on the ground. But  very soon the dog discovered that here there was no evil, for it trotted  over to the old woman, and without any more preparation jumped into her  lap.    The old woman grinned at the dog \"Ah, you thing you!\" said she, and she  gave it her finger to bite. The delighted puppy chewed her bony  finger, and then instituted a mimic warfare against a piece of rag that  fluttered from her breast, barking and growling in joyous excitement,  while the old woman fondled and hugged it.    The door of the house opposite opened quickly, and a woman with a  frost-bitten face came out.    \"Leave that dog down,\" said she.    The old woman grinned humbly at her.    \"Sure, ma'am, I wouldn't hurt the little dog, the thing!\"    \"Put down that dog,\" said the woman, \"and go about your business--the  likes of you ought to be arrested.\"    A man in shirt sleeves appeared behind her, and at him the old woman  grinned even more humbly.    \"Let me sit here for a while and play with the little dog, sir,\" said  she; \"sure the roads do be lonesome--\"    The man stalked close and grabbed the dog by the scruff of the neck. It  hung between his finger and thumb with its tail tucked between its legs  and its eyes screwed round on one side in amazement.    \"Be off with you out of that, you old strap!\" said the man in a terrible  voice.    So the old woman rose painfully to her feet again, and as she went  hobbling along the dusty road she began to cry.    The Philosopher also arose; he was very indignant but did not know what  to do. A singular lassitude also prevented him from interfering. As they  paced along his companion began mumbling, more to herself than to him  \"Ah, God be with me,\" said she, \"an old woman on a stick, that hasn't  a place in the wide world to go to or a neighbour itself.... I wish  I could get a cup of tea, so I do. I wish to God I could get a cup  of tea.... Me sitting down in my own little house, with the white  tablecloth on the table, and the butter in the dish, and the strong, red  tea in the tea-cup; and me pouring cream into it, and, maybe, telling  the children not to be wasting the sugar, the things! and himself saying  he'd got to mow the big field to-day, or that the red cow was going  to calve, the poor thing, and that if the boys went to school, who was  going to weed the turnips--and me sitting drinking my strong cup of tea,  and telling him where that old trapesing hen was laying.... Ah, God be  with me! an old creature hobbling along the roads on a stick. I wish I  was a young girl again, so I do, and himself coming courting me, and him  saying that I was a real nice little girl surely, and that nothing would  make him happy or easy at all but me to be loving him.--Ah, the kind man  that he was, to be sure, the kind, decent man.... And Sorca Reilly to be  trying to get him from me, and Kate Finnegan with her bold eyes looking  after him in the Chapel; and him to be saying that along with me they  were only a pair of old nanny goats.... And then me to be getting  married and going home to my own little house with my man--ah, God be  with me! and him kissing me, and laughing, and frightening me with his  goings-on. Ah, the kind man, with his soft eyes, and his nice voice, and  his jokes and laughing, and him thinking the world and all of me--ay,  indeed.... And the neighbours to be coming in and sitting round the fire  in the night time, putting the world through each other, and talking  about France and Russia and them other queer places, and him holding  up the discourse like a learned man, and them all listening to him and  nodding their heads at each other, and wondering at his education and  all: or, maybe, the neighbours to be singing, or him making me sing the  Coulin, and him to be proud of me... and then him to be killed on me  with a cold on his chest. ... Ah, then, God be with me, a lone,  old creature on a stick, and the sun shining into her eyes and she  thirsty--I wish I had a cup of tea, so I do. I wish to God I had a cup  of tea and a bit of meat... or, maybe, an egg. A nice fresh egg laid  by the speckeldy hen that used to be giving me all the trouble, the  thing!... Sixteen hens I had, and they were the ones for laying,  surely.... It's the queer world, so it is, the queer world--and the  things that do happen for no reason at all.... Ah, God be with me! I  wish there weren't stones in my boots, so I do, and I wish to God I had  a cup of tea and a fresh egg. Ah, glory be, my old legs are getting  tireder every day, so they are. Wisha, one time--when himself was in  it--I could go about the house all day long, cleaning the place, and  feeding the pigs, and the hens and all, and then dance half the night,  so I could: and himself proud of me....\"    The old woman turned up a little rambling road and went on still talking  to herself, and the Philosopher watched her go up that road for a long  time. He was very glad she had gone away, and as he tramped forward he  banished her sad image so that in a little time he was happy again. The  sun was still shining, the birds were flying on every side, and the wide  hill-side above him smiled gaily.    A small, narrow road cut at right angles into his path, and as he  approached this he heard the bustle and movement of a host, the trample  of feet, the rolling and creaking of wheels, and the long unwearied  drone of voices. In a few minutes he came abreast of this small road,  and saw an ass and cart piled with pots and pans, and walking beside  this there were two men and a woman. The men and the woman were talking  together loudly, even fiercely, and the ass was drawing his cart along  the road without requiring assistance or direction. While there was a  road he walked on it: when he might come to a cross road he would turn  to the right: when a man said \"whoh\" he would stop: when he said \"hike\"  he would go backwards, and when he said \"yep\" he would go on again. That  was life, and if one questioned it, one was hit with a stick, or a boot,  or a lump of rock: if one continued walking nothing happened, and that  was happiness.    The Philosopher saluted this cavalcade.    \"God be with you,\" said he.    \"God and Mary be with you,\" said the first man.    \"God, and Mary, and Patrick be with you,\" said the second man.    \"God, and Mary, and Patrick, and Brigid be with you,\" said the woman.    The ass, however, did not say a thing. As the word \"whoh\" had not  entered into the conversation he knew it was none of his business, and  so he turned to the right on the new path and continued his journey.    \"Where are you going to, stranger,\" said the first man.    \"I am going to visit Angus Og,\" replied the Philosopher.    The man gave him a quick look.    \"Well,\" said he, \"that's the queerest story I ever heard. Listen here,\"  he called to the others, \"this man is looking for Angus Og.\"    The other man and woman came closer.    \"What would you be wanting with Angus Og, Mister Honey?\" said the woman.    \"Oh,\" replied the Philosopher, \"it's a particular thing, a family  matter.\"    There was silence for a few minutes, and they all stepped onwards behind  the ass and cart.    \"How do you know where to look for himself?\" said the first man again:  \"maybe you got the place where he lives written down in an old book or  on a carved stone?\"    \"Or did you find the staff of Amergin or of Ossian in a bog and it  written from the top to the bottom with signs?\" said the second man.    \"No,\" said the Philosopher, \"it isn't that way you'd go visiting a god.  What you do is, you go out from your house and walk straight away in  any direction with your shadow behind you so long as it is towards a  mountain, for the gods will not stay in a valley or a level plain, but  only in high places; and then, if the god wants you to see him, you will  go to his rath as direct as if you knew where it was, for he will be  leading you with an airy thread reaching from his own place to wherever  you are, and if he doesn't want to see you, you will never find out  where he is, not if you were to walk for a year or twenty years.\"    \"How do you know he wants to see you?\" said the second man.    \"Why wouldn't he want?\" said the Philosopher.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#12)"],[1,"_Est. de Sal._)      Del salon en el angulo obscuro,    De su dueno tal vez olvidada,    Silenciosa y cubierta de polvo,      Veiase el arpa.           (Becquer, _Rima_ VII)                                                               page lxiii  In the nineteenth century this line came to be popular in  patriotic songs which are sung by the multitude, while the  crash of the drum marks the rhythmic accents:      Entonemos festivos cantares,    Pues el dia feliz ha llegado,    Que del yugo servil aliviado    Goza ya el Espanol libertad.    (_La Constitucion_)      Al combate corred, Bayameses,    Que la patria os contempla orgullosa;    No temais una muerte gloriosa,    Que morir por la patria es vivir.    (Cuban national hymn, cf. p. 251)    The commoner form of verse with 11-syllable ternary lines  is that popularly called \"_de gaita gallega_\" (Men. Pel.,  _Ant._, V, p. cxcv; X, 141. Cf. also Mila, _op. cit._),  the assumption being that this verse is intimately related  to that type of popular Galician poetry known as the  _muineira_, which was sung to the music of the bagpipe.  These lines are typical of the \"_endecasilabos de gaita  gallega_\":      Tanto baile a la puerta del cura,    Tanto baile que me dio calentura;    Tanto baile a la puerta del horno,    Tanto baile que me dieron un bollo.[37]    [Footnote 34: Many Galician _muineiras_ have been  collected: cf. Mila, _op. cit._; Carolina Michaelis de  Vasconcellos, _Cancioneiro de Ajuda_, Vol. II, Halle,  1904; Jose Perez Ballesteros, _Cancionero popular  gallego_, Madrid, 1885.]                                                               page lxxiv  Menendez y Pelayo (_Ant._ X, 141) gives, in his collection  of _Romances tradicionales de Asturias_, the following one  in ternary 11-syllable lines:    =La tentacion=      --iAy, probe Xuana de cuerpo garrido!    iAy, probe Xuana de cuerpo galano!    ?Donde le dexas al tu buen amigo?    ?Donde le dexas al tu buen amado?    --iMuerto le dexo a la orilla del rio,    muerto le dexo a la orilla del vado!    --?Cuanto me das, volveretelo vivo?    ?Cuanto me das, volveretelo sano?    --Doyte las armas y doyte el rocino,    doyte las armas y doyte el caballo.    --No he menester ni armas ni rocino,    no he menester ni armas ni caballo...    It should be noted that this poem has assonance of the  odd and of the even lines. Men. Pel. says of this popular  11-syllable _romance_ that \"su aparicion en la poesia  popular castellana es un fenomeno singular, aun en  Asturias misma, y hasta ahora no se ha presentado mas  ejemplo que este.\" Note the apparent shifting of stress in  _armas_. Iriarte and L. Moratin did not scorn to use this  line.    Iriarte:      Cierta criada la casa barria    Con una escoba muy sucia y muy vieja...    Moratin (in the chorus of _Padres del Limbo_):      Huyan los anos con rapido vuelo;    Goce la tierra durable consuelo;    Mire a los hombres piadoso el Senor...                                                                page lxxv  The 11-syllable line of ternary movement has had less  vogue in artistic verse than those of ten and twelve  syllables.[38]    [Footnote 38: In _Las hijas del Cid_ E. Marquina has used a  flexible 11-syllable ternary line beginning with either  [\\-] - - [\\-] or - [\\-] - [\\-]:      Sus nombres juntos los llevo en el alma,    Juntos los guarda tambien mi memoria.    These are blank verses with occasional assonance.]    The Spanish ternary 12-syllable line was formerly used  chiefly in combination with lines of ten or eleven  syllables. Some examples of mingled 10-and 12-syllable  lines have already been given above. Another is:        Mancebito, perdone las hembras,    Que comen y beben y no tienen rentas.    --Pues, mocitas, malditas sean ellas,      O cosan o labren o caiganse muertas.    A song of mingled 11-and 12-syllable lines begins thus:      Al pasar la barca, me dijo el barquero:    Moza bonita no paga dinero.[39]    [Footnote 39: Cf. Mila, _op. cit._ In singing _pasar_,  there is apparently a shifting of stress which is not  uncommon in songs.]    Efforts have been made from time to time to use the  ternary movements in erudite verse, but these, for the  most part, have proven futile. The most serious and the  most successful attempt appears in the use of the _copla  de arte mayor_ in the fifteenth century. The _copla  (metro, versos) de arte mayor_ consists of mingled 12-and  11-syllable lines arranged in strophes of eight lines,  each with consonantal rime according to some definite  scheme. The _arte mayor_ verse attained to its most  perfect form and its greatest popularity in                  page lxxvi  _El laberinto de la fortuna_ (1444?), by Juan de Mena, of  which the following is a strophe:      Amores me dieron corona de amores    porque mi nombre por mas bocas ande;    entonces no era mi mal menos grande,    quando me dauan plazer sus dolores;    vencen el seso sus dulces errores,    mas non duran sienpre, segund luego plazen;    pues me fizieron del mal que vos fazen,    sabed al amor desamar, amadores.    (Strophe 106)    The old _arte mayor_ verse has these distinguishing  characteristics:    The line is divided into hemistichs, each of which may  have four, five or six syllables, thus:      (1) (-) - - - [/-] (-) | (-) - - - [/-] (-),    except that the final syllable of the first hemistich  and the initial syllable of the second may not both be  lacking. These arrangements may also occur (the third is  rare):      (2) (-) - - - [/-] - - | - - - [/-] (-)      (3) (-) - - - [/-] | - - - - - [/-] (-).    Examples of types:      (1) Las grandes fazanas | de nuestros mayores... (Str. 4)        Vayan de gente | sabidos en gente... (Str. 3)        Reconoceran | maguer que feroce... (Str. 274)        Assi que qualquiera | cuerpo ya muerto... (Str. 244)        Cuya virtud | maguer que reclama...        Sufren que passen | males e vicios... (Str. 232)      (2) E vi a Pitagoras | que defendia... (Str. 118)        Bien como medico | mucho famoso... (Str. 178)      (3) Quando el senor | es en necessidad... (Str. 258)                                                              page lxxvii  The initial unstressed syllable of the first hemistich is  lacking in approximately one-third of the lines of the  _Laberinto_. These lines resemble the 11-syllable _gaita  gallega_ verse, and the others resemble the popular  Galician 12-syllable ternary line, for in both the final  unstressed syllable of the first hemistich may fall,[40]  which seems to indicate that the appearance of the _arte  mayor_ verse in Castilian was due to Galician influence.    [Footnote 40: Cf. these Galician _muineiras_, cited by Mila  y Fontanals (_Romania_, VI, p. 47 f.):        Cando te vexo | na beira do rio,      Queda o meu corpo | tembrando de frio;      Cando te vexo | d'o monte n'altura,    A todo o mon corpo | lle da calentura.      Isca d'ahi | galina maldita,      Isca d'ahi | non me mate la pita;      Isca d'ahi | galina ladrona,      Isca d'ahi | pra cas de tua dona.]    Again, as in many Galician songs of this type, the ternary  movement of the old _arte mayor_ verse is not strictly  regular. Approximately nine-tenths of the lines in the  _Laberinto_ may be read with regular ternary movement:      (-) [/-] - - [/-] (-) | (-) [/-] - - [/-] (-),    by giving a rhythmic accent to a syllable with secondary  stress or to a middle syllable in a group of atonics, in a  not inconsiderable number of lines, as in:      Por las alturas, | collados y cerros...    Assi que tu eres | la governadora...    In the remaining lines the commonest movement is:      (-) - [/-] - [/-] (-) | (-) - [/-] - [/-] (-),    as in:    Aquel claro padre, aquel dulce fuente...                   page lxxviii    In the second half of the sixteenth century and in the  seventeenth century, the _arte mayor_ verse was out of  fashion, although it appeared occasionally, as in these  lines of Lope de Vega (a variety of the Sapphic strophe),  with inner rime:      Amor poderoso en cielo y en tierra,    dulcisima guerra de nuestros sentidos,    ioh, cuantos perdidos con vida inquieta          tu imperio sujeta!    (From first act of _Dorotea_)    In the nineteenth century it was restored to favor by  the romanticists.[41] Good examples are: Espronceda,  _El templario_; Avellaneda, _Las siete palabras_; and  Zorrilla, _A un torreon_ (part). Some writers used it even  in the drama (cf. Gil y Zarate, _Guzman el bueno_). The  modern _arte mayor_ verse is written in 12-syllable lines,  usually with regular ternary movement. Thus:      iOh Antilla dichosa! | ?que magicos sones,    Que luz inefable, | que extrana alegria,    Del cielo destierran los negros crespones,    Prestando a esta noche | la pompa del dia?      ?Por que tan ufana, | tan bella la luna    Con faz refulgente | comienza su giro,    Y no hay leve sombra | que cruce importuna    Su trono esmaltado | de plata y zafiro?    (Avellaneda, _Serenata de Cuba_)    [Footnote 41: Iriarte, of course, had written a fable or  two in _arte mayor_ verse. Cf. _Fabula_ XXXIX.]                                                               page lxxix    Soldados, la Patria | nos llama a la lid;    Juremos por ella | vencer o morir;    Serenos, alegres, | valientes, osados,    Cantemos, soldados, | el himno a la lid:    Ya nuestros acentos | el orbe se admire,    Y en nosotros[42] mire | los hijos del Cid;    Ya nuestros acentos | el orbe se admire,    Y en nosotros mire | los hijos del Cid.          (_Himno de Riego_: cf. p. 242)    [Footnote 42: Note in _nosotros_ the shifting of stress,  which the musical notation indicates clearly.]    Lines of fourteen and fifteen syllables with ternary  movement are never popular, and in artistic verse they  are exceedingly rare. Avellaneda used these measures in  _Soledad del alma_:      Sale la aurora risuena, de flores vestida,    Dandole al cielo y al campo variado color;    Todo se anima sintiendo brotar nueva vida,    "]]]
