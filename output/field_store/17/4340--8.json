Confronted by  Damaris with a riding-whip in one hand, a special license in the other,  and Wellington at her heels, the fox-faced young man had professed a  desire to marry the tweeny on the spot.    Then had been granted a seventh-heaven glimpse of what love, real love,  can be, to the tweeny maid, changing her into a veritable spitfire, who  had turned and rent the fox-faced youth.    \"I wouldn't 'ave you, nohow, no, not if yer were the larst man on  earth, not 'alf I wouldn't.  I'll get through my trouble, miss, all  right, an' by meself, thanking you kindly for troubling, an' I'll wait  until Mister Right comes along; that's what I'll do, Mister Runaway.\"    And when Mr. Runaway had hinted that Mr. Right might kick at being  called upon to shoulder the encumbrances of others, she had snatched  the special license from her young mistress, torn it into bits, flung  it into the foxy face and blazed into a big-hearted, big-minded,  all-understanding little tweeny maid of a woman.    \"I said Mr. Right, didn't I, yer bloomin' chuckhead?  'E'll unnerstand  that it was all done in mistake, an' not by preference, so to speak.  An' unnerstandin', he'll forgive.  Lots of them mistakes are made by  girls like me\"--thumping of washed but still grimy hand above gallant  little heart--\"through swipes like you.  Life's full of 'em down our  way.  But life's love, and love's life, and you can't get away from  that, that yer can't.  And I'd raver die wiv my love shut up  'ere\"--more thumps above gallant little heart--\"than throw it away on a  louse like you, _that_ I would, not 'arf!\"    Ben Kelham said nothing, and there fell a silence between the two,  though the Egyptian night was as full of noise as it ever is in the big  cities of the East.    \"What did she mean, Ben,\" said Damaris at last, \"by that love which  understanding can forgive even--even _her_ trouble?\"    And to Ben Kelham came the tweeny's seventh-heaven glimpse of the  understanding of real love.    He rose and swept Damaris, a-thrill at the mastery, into his arms,  where he held her as he might have held a child.    \"That, dear,\"--and he spoke choosing the simplest words, just because  he knew no others, \"that means that if you said you loved me, and I--if  I ever found you in a--how shall I put it?--in--no matter how  compromising a situation--that I should love you just the same, because  I should know that, although to all appearances you--you might have  sinned, yet the real you, the pure, honourable, perfect woman in you,  could not show the smallest stain.  Do you understand?\"    \"Almost,\" whispered the girl, as she lay still in the arms that held  her as a child.    \"You've _got_ to understand.  Listen!  It may sound brutal, but you've  got to understand my love for you.  Supposing you disappeared, as  Englishwomen do sometimes in the East.  Supposing I searched, and found  you, and you--you were--you were like the little tweeny girl.  What  should I do?  Why, Damaris, unless you came to me and confessed to sin,  I'd marry you, loving you, understanding you, without asking any  questions.\"    \"Without asking any explanation?\"    \"Yes, dear.  Yes.  Because I love you----\"    \"And you would forgive me?\"    \"But, dear, there wouldn't be any need for forgiveness; the real, pure  you would not have done anything wrong.\"    Then he blundered.    Like most big men, he was diffident; he underestimated the attraction  of his strength allied to a very gentle courtesy; in fact, bound up in  his love for Damaris, he had never given it a thought excepting to  curse the awkwardness of his body and the slowness of his speech.  He  knew nothing of the honesty which looked out of the eyes; the quiet  strength of his movements and speech; the feeling of confidence he  inspired.    He was not given to self-analysis; he loved the sun in the heavens, the  grass under foot and the traditions of his house too much to waste time  on that kind of thing.    So that, fearing to have hurt the girl or bored the girl, he plumped  her on her feet, when he could have won her and saved her and others,  including himself, a mint of pain if he had only just crushed her up to  his heart and kissed her.    She stood quite still, with that dazed little feeling which falls upon  one who has entered the wrong room.    \"I'm not going to bother you any more, dear,\" he said, watching for the  flash of relief which did not cross the beautiful face.    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"There has come a report of lion somewhere near Karnak.  I think I  shall run down and have a look round.  I thought of going on to Nairobi  once I was really fit, so have got all my shooting gear with me.  But,  remember, you have only to send for me, and I will come.  And don't try  to run away, Damaris.\"  And his voice was stern as he took her by the  shoulders and drew her towards him.  \"You are mine!  I'm letting you go  now because you want to learn about life, and that you can't do if you  have a man always on your heels.  You will learn all right, dear, and  suffer a bit, dear, but you will come to me in the end.    \"I can't offer you the witchery and colouring and poetry of the East,  but I do offer you the biggest love there has ever been in a man's  heart for a woman and------\"    A troupe of riotous guests came streaming down the path.    \"One o'clock!\" they shouted.  \"One o'clock.  Masks off; masks off!\"    The two walked slowly towards them.    \"You _would_ like a lion's skin, wouldn't you?\" he asked eagerly, and  stared amazed at the reproachful, hurt eyes which looked back at him  just as the dancers swooped upon her.    A lion's skin!  When she was craving for the strength of his arms about  her, and the tower of his love behind her, from the top of which she  could safely make monkey-faces of derision at Life, standing with  lesson-books in one hand and a cane in the other.    She turned her back on him and entered the ballroom, and he went back  to the seat in the garden, unconscious of the woman who watched.    And as the merry little crowd ran laughing into the hotel, the duchess,  with mind intent on a cigarette, slipped out of another door and  hurried as fast as her outrageous heels would allow her to a seat under  the date-palms.    She took a Three Castles from the jewelled Louis XV snuff-box, rasped a  match on the sole of one little crimson shoe, lit her cigarette, and  studied the slipper.    Then she turned her head and saw a man, an Arab, standing beside the  seat.    There had been no sound; just out of the dark he had suddenly  materialised in the startling, silent way of the East.    Well does it behove us to remember that we have claimed the privilege  of giving lessons in morality, culture, good-breeding, manners, in  fact, in one word, civilisation to the world at large.    In the glaring sun of an Eastern mid-day you can sit with your feet  figuratively or literally on the table, if it pleases you; it will but  be accounted as one more eccentricity unto you; but in the shadows, an'  you would retain the position of teacher to the world at large, keep  the heels on the rail of your chair; for there are ears and eyes a-many  in the shadows and behind the silken curtain.    But it took a good deal more than the sudden appearance of a native to  make the old lady start.    She put out her cigarette with the toe of a red shoe, took another from  the snuff-box, rasped a match--not on the sole of her foot this  time--lit the fragrant weed and looked at the man, who salaamed.    \"Yes?\" she said courteously.    \"I am the fortune-teller, great lady.  In the sand, by the stars, or  the lines of your jewelled hand, if in your graciousness you will  permit me, I will tell you your future.\"    \"My son, behold.  I am near the sunset, the moment approaches when my  tired feet will advance still further upon the bridge which leadeth me  to my God and your God.  What is past I know; what is, _is_; what is to  be, is so near that, behold, sometimes in the stillness of the night I  hear the angels whispering as they take counsel as to the moment when,  one shall tap me upon the shoulder, saying, 'Come!'\"    He sank to the ground just at her feet and looked up in the splendid  old face with an agony of hurt born of misunderstanding in his own, so  that, suddenly realising that her refusal had been taken for antipathy,  she stretched out her hand, which, having first pulled a corner of his  white mantle between, he held upon the back of his own.    \"Tell me, then, of those I love.\"    The fortune-teller looked her straight in the face.    \"Thy hands are full of love-flowers, white woman; thy head is crowned  with them; thy feet pass upon them; thou art all love.  Yea! even  though there are many upon the bridge who, having preceded thee, await  thy coming, yet art thou surrounded with love.  And in the flowers in  thy hands is there one which thou cherishest, and for which thou  fearest.    \"Fear not, wise woman; let thy heart beat tranquilly at dawn, at noon  and at the setting of the sun; for it is written that no harm shall  befall the flower, no stain shall mark the ivory petals of innocence;  no rude hand pluck it before its time.  Thou art not the only one to  love the flower, wise woman.  There is one also who loveth it and  watcheth it and will pluck it in due season; there is yet another who  loveth and watcheth, but from a great, great distance.  If by the grace  of Allah, who is God, the flower should be placed even for the passing  of an hour within the hands of him who watcheth from afar, I tell thee,  for so it is written, fear not, for no harm shall befall the fragrant  blossom.\"    The old woman nodded her head so that the diamond leaves glistened, and  smiled gently and lifting her hand pulled aside the corner of the  mantle, and laid her hand again on his.    \"Nay,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],[0,"History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#12)"],[1,"element and building thereon a whole system of  anti-Jewish persecutions and cruelties. But St. Petersburg was not  amenable to reason. The only concession wrested from the \"Jewish  Committee\" consisted in replacing the term \"useless\" as applied to small  tradesmen by the designation \"not engaged in productive labor.\"    [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 340.]    The cruel project continued to engage the attention of the \"Jewish  Committee\" for a long time. In April, 1815, the chairman of the  Committee, Kiselev, addressed a circular to the governors-general in  which he pointed out that after the promulgation of the laws concerning  the establishment of Crown schools and the abolition of the  Kahals--laws-which were aimed at \"the weakening of the influence of the  Talmud\" and the destruction of all institutions \"fostering the separate  individuality of the Jews\"--the turn had come for carrying into effect,  by means of the proposed classification, the measures directed towards  \"the transfer of the Jews to useful labor.\" Of the regulations tending  to affect the Jews \"culturally\" the circular emphasizes the prohibition  of Jewish dress to take effect after the lapse of five years.      All the regulations alluded to--Kiselev writes--have been issued and    will be issued separately, _in order to conceal their interrelation    and common aim from the fanaticism, of the Jews_. For this reason    his Imperial Majesty has been graciously pleased to command me to    communicate all the said plans to the Governors-General    _confidentially_.    It would seem, however, that the Russian authorities had grossly  underestimated the political sense of the Jews. They were not aware of  the fact that St. Petersburg's conspiracy against Judaism had long been  exposed in the Pale of Settlement, if only for the reason that the  conspirators were not clever enough to hide even for a time the  chastising knout beneath the cloak of \"cultural\" reforms.      4. INTERCESSION OF WESTERN EUROPEAN JEWRY    The mask of the Russian Government was soon torn down also before the  yes of Western Europe. In the initial stage of Lilienthal's campaign,  public-minded Jews of Western Europe were inclined to believe that a  happy era was dawning upon their coreligionists in Russia. At the  instance of Uvarov, Lilienthal had entered into correspondence with  Philippson, Geiger, Cremieux, Montefiore, and other leaders of  West-European Jewry, bespeaking their moral support on behalf of the  school-reform and going so far as to invite them to participate in the  proceedings of the Rabbinical Commission convened at St. Petersburg. The  replies from these prominent Jews were full of complimentary references  to Uvarov's endeavors. The _Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums_,[1] in the  beginning of the forties, voiced the general belief that the era of  persecutions in Russia had come to an end.    [Footnote 1: A weekly founded by Dr. Ludwig Philippson in 1837. It still  appears in Berlin.]    The frontier expulsions of 1843 acted like a cold douche on these  enthusiasts. They realized that the pitiless banishment of thousands of  families from home and hearth was not altogether compatible with  \"benevolent intentions.\" A sensational piece of news made its rounds  through Germany: the well-known painter Oppenheim of Frankfurt-on-the-Main  had given up working at the large picture ordered by the leaders of  several Jewish communities for presentation to the Tzar. The painting  had been intended as an allegory, picturing a sunrise in a dark realm,  but the happy anticipations proved a will o' the wisp, and the plan had  to be given up. Instead, Western Europe was resounding with moans from  Russia, betokening new persecutions and even more atrocious schemes of  restrictions. The sufferings of the Russian Jews suggested the thought  that it was the duty of the influential Jews of the West to intercede on  behalf of their persecuted brethren before the emperor of Russia.    The choice fell on the famous Jewish philanthropist in London, Sir Moses  Montefiore, who stood in close relations to the court of Queen Victoria.  Having established his fame by championing the Jewish cause in Turkey  during the ritual murder trial of Damascus in 1840, Montefiore resolved  to make a similar attempt in the land of the Tzar. In the beginning of  1846 he set out for Russia, ostensibly in the capacity of a traveler  desirous of familiarizing himself with the condition of his  coreligionists. Montefiore, who was the bearer of a personal  recommendation from Queen Victoria to the Russian emperor, was received  in St. Petersburg with great honors. During an audience granted to  Montefiore in March, 1846, the Tzar expressed his willingness to receive  from him, through the medium of the \"Jewish Committee,\" suggestions  bearing on the condition of the Russian Jews, based on the information  to be gathered by him on his travels. Montefiore's journey through the  Pale of Settlement, including a visit to Vilna, Warsaw, and other  cities, was marked by great solemnity. He was courteously received by  the highest local officials, who acted according to instructions from  St. Petersburg, and he met everywhere with an enthusiastic welcome from  the Jewish masses, who expected great results from his intercession  before the Tzar.    Needless to say, these expectations were not realized. On his return to  London, Montefiore addressed various petitions to Kiselev, the chairman  of the Jewish Committee, to Minister Uvarov and to Paskevich, the then  viceroy of Poland. Everywhere he pleaded for a mitigation of the harsh  laws which were pressing upon his unfortunate brethren, for the  restoration of the recently abolished communal autonomy, for the  harmonization of the school-reform with the religious traditions of the  Jewish masses. The Tzar was informed of the contents of these petitions,  but it was all of no avail.    In the same year another influential foreigner made an unsuccessful  attempt to improve the condition of the Russian Jews by emigration. A  rich Jewish merchant of Marseille, named Isaac Altaras, came to Russia  with a proposal to transplant a certain number of Jews to Algiers, which  had recently passed under French rule. Fortified by letters of  recommendation from Premier Guizot and other high officials in France,  Altaras entered into negotiations with the Ministers Nesselrode and  Perovski in St. Petersburg and with Viceroy Paskevich in Warsaw, for the  purpose of obtaining permission for a certain number of Jews to emigrate  from Russia.[1] He gave the assurance that the French Government was  ready to admit into Algiers, as full-fledged citizens, thousands of  destitute Russian Jews, and that the means for transferring them would  be provided by Rothschild's banking house in Paris. At first, while in  St. Petersburg, Altaras was informed that permission to leave Russia  would be granted only on condition that a fixed ransom be paid for every  emigrant.    In Warsaw, however, which city he visited later, in October, 1846, he  was notified that the Tzar had decided to waive the ransom. For some  unexplained reason Altaras left Russia suddenly, and the scheme of a  Jewish mass emigration fell through.    [Footnote 1: A law on the Russian statute books forbids the emigration  of Russian citizens abroad. See later, p. 285, n. 1.]      5. THE ECONOMIC PLIGHT OF RUSSIAN JEWRY AND AGRICULTURAL  EXPERIMENTS    The attempt at thinning the Jewish population by emigration having  failed, the congested Jewish masses continued to gasp for air in their  Pale of Settlement. The slightest effort to penetrate beyond the Pale  into the interior was treated as a criminal offence. In December, 1847,  the Council of State engaged in a protracted and earnest discussion  about the geographical point up to which the Jewish coachmen of Polotzk  should be allowed, to drive the inmates of the local school of cadets on  their annual trips to the Russian capital. The discussion arose out of  the fact that the road leading from Polotzk to St. Petersburg is crossed  by the line separating the Pale from the prohibited interior. A proposal  had been made to permit the coachmen to drive their passengers as far as  Pskov. But when the report was submitted to the Tzar, he appended the  following resolution: \"Agreeable; though not to Pskov, but to  Ostrov\"--the town nearest to the Pale. Of this trivial kind were  Russia's methods in curtailing Jewish rights three months before the  great upheaval which in adjoining Germany and Austria dealt the  death-blow to absolutism and inaugurated the era of the \"Second  Emancipation.\"    As for the economic life of the Jews, it had been completely undermined  by the system of ruthless tutelage, which the Government had employed  for a quarter of a century in the hope of \"reconstructing\" it. All these  drumhead methods, such as the hurling of masses of living beings from  villages into towns and from the border-zone into the interior, the  prohibition of certain occupations and the artificial promotion of  others, could not but result in economic ruin, instead of leading to  economic reform.    Nor was the governmental system of encouraging agriculture among Jews  attended by greater success. In consequence of the expulsion of tens of  thousands of Jews from the villages of White Busier in 1823, some two  thousand refugees had drifted into the agricultural colonies of New  Russia, but all they did was to replace the human wastage from increased  mortality, which, owing to the change of climate and the unaccustomed  conditions of rural life, had decimated the original settlers. During  the reign of Nicholas, efforts were again made to promote agricultural  colonization by offering the prospective immigrants subsidies and  alleviations in taxation. Even more valuable was the privilege relieving  the colonists from military service for a term of twenty-five to fifty  "]]]
