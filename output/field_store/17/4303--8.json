On the contrary, his work for many years had been with Christian people,  circulating emigration pamphlets and active as agent for a mission  publication. Men who knew him say that he was a law-abiding, quiet,  industrious, peaceable man. So he lived.    So he lived and so he would have died had not he raised his hand to resent  unprovoked assault and unlawful arrest that fateful Monday night. That  made him an outlaw, and being a man of courage he decided to die with his  face to the foe. The white people of this country may charge that he was a  desperado, but to the people of his own race Robert Charles will always be  regarded as the hero of New Orleans.      +BURNING HUMAN BEINGS ALIVE +    Not only has life been taken by mobs in the past twenty years, but the  ordinary procedure of hanging and shooting have been improved upon during  the past ten years. Fifteen human beings have been burned to death in the  different parts of the country by mobs. Men, women and children have gone  to see the sight, and all have approved the barbarous deeds done in the  high light of the civilization and Christianity of this country.    In 1891 Ed Coy was burned to death in Texarkana, Ark. He was charged with  assaulting a white woman, and after the mob had securely tied him to a  tree, the men and boys amused themselves for some time sticking knives  into Coy's body and slicing off pieces, of flesh. When they had amused  themselves sufficiently, they poured coal oil over him and the women in  the case set fire to him. It is said that fifteen thousand people stood by  and saw him burned. This was on a Sunday night, and press reports told how  the people looked on while the Negro burned to death.    Feb. 1, 1893, Henry Smith was burned to death in Paris, Texas. The entire  county joined in that exhibition. The district attorney himself went for  the prisoner and turned him over to the mob. He was placed upon a float  and drawn by four white horses through the principal streets of the city.  Men, women and children stood at their doors and waved their handkerchiefs  and cheered the echoes. They knew that the man was to be burned to death  because the newspaper had declared for three days previous that this would  be so. Excursions were run by all the railroads, and the mayor of the town  gave the children a holiday so that they might see the sight.    Henry Smith was charged with having assaulted and murdered a little white  girl. He was an imbecile, and while he had killed the child, there was no  proof that he had criminally assaulted her. He was tied to a stake on a  platform which had been built ten feet high, so that everybody might see  the sight. The father and brother and uncle of the little white girl that  had been murdered was upon that platform about fifty minutes entertaining  the crowd of ten thousand persons by burning the victim's flesh with  red-hot irons. Their own newspapers told how they burned his eyes out and,  ran the red-hot iron down his throat, cooking his tongue, and how the  crowd cheered wild delight. At last, having declared themselves satisfied,  coal oil was poured over him and he was burned to death, and the mob  fought over the ashes for bones and pieces of his clothes.    July 7, 1893, in Bardwell, Ky., C.J. Miller was burned to ashes. Since his  death this man has been found to be absolutely innocent of the murder of  the two white girls with which he was charged. But the mob would wait for  no justification. They insisted that, as they were not sure he was the  right man, they would compromise the matter by hanging him instead of  burning. Not to be outdone, they took the body down and made a huge  bonfire out of it.    July 22, 1893, at Memphis, Tenn., the body of Lee Walker was dragged  through the street and burned before the court house. Walker had  frightened some girls in a wagon along a country road by asking them to  let him ride in their wagon. They cried out; some men working in a field  near by said it was at attempt of assault, and of course began to look for  their prey. There was never any charge of rape; the women only declared  that he attempted an assault. After he was apprehended and put in jail and  perfectly helpless, the mob dragged him out, shot him, cut him, beat him  with sticks, built a fire and burned the legs off, then took the trunk of  the body down and dragged further up the street, and at last burned it  before the court house.    Sept. 20, 1893, at Roanoke, Va., the body of a Negro who had quarreled  with a white woman was burned in the presence of several thousand persons.  These people also wreaked their vengeance upon this helpless victim of the  mob's wrath by sticking knives into him, kicking him and beating him with  stones and otherwise mutilating him before life was extinct.    June 11, 1898, at Knoxville, Ark., James Perry was shut up in a cabin  because he had smallpox and burned to death. He had been quarantined in  this cabin when it was declared that he had this disease and the doctor  sent for. When the physician arrived he found only a few smoldering  embers. Upon inquiry some railroad hands who were working nearby revealed  the fact that they had fastened the door of the cabin and set fire to the  cabin and burned man and hut together.    Feb. 22, 1898, at Lake City, S.C., Postmaster Baker and his infant child  were burned to death by a mob that had set fire to his house. Mr. Baker's  crime was that he had refused to give up the post office, to which he had  been appointed by the National Government. The mob had tried to drive him  away by persecution and intimidation. Finding that all else had failed,  they went to his home in the dead of night and set fire to his house, and  as the family rushed forth they were greeted by a volley of bullets. The  father and his baby were shot through the open door and wounded so badly  that they fell back in the fire and were burned to death. The remainder of  the family, consisting of the wife and five children, escaped with their  lives from the burning house, but all of them were shot, one of the number  made a cripple for life.    Jan. 7, 1898, two Indians were tied to a tree at Maud Post Office, Indian  Territory, and burned to death by a white mob. They were charged with  murdering a white woman. There was no proof of their guilt except the  unsupported word of the mob. Yet they were tied to a tree and slowly  roasted to death. Their names were Lewis McGeesy and Hond Martin. Since  that time these boys have been found to be absolutely innocent of the  charge. Of course that discovery is too late to be of any benefit to them,  but because they were Indians the Indian Commissioner demanded and  received from the United States Government an indemnity of $13,000.    April 23, 1899, at Palmetto, Ga., Sam Hose was burned alive in the  presence of a throng, on Sunday afternoon. He was charged with killing a  man named Cranford, his employer, which he admitted he did because his  employer was about to shoot him. To the fact of killing the employer was  added the absolutely false charge that Hose assaulted the wife. Hose was  arrested and no trial was given him. According to the code of reasoning of  the mob, none was needed. A white man had been killed and a white woman  was said to have been assaulted. That was enough. When Hose was found he  had to die.    The Atlanta Constitution, in speaking of the murder of Cranford, said that  the Negro who was suspected would be burned alive. Not only this, but it  offered $500 reward for his capture. After he had been apprehended, it was  publicly announced that he would be burned alive. Excursion trains were  run and bulletins were put up in the small towns. The Governor of Georgia  was in Atlanta while excursion trains were being made up to take visitors  to the burning. Many fair ladies drove out in their carriages on Sunday  afternoon to witness the torture and burning of a human being. Hose's ears  were cut off, then his toes and fingers, and passed round to the crowd.  His eyes were put out, his tongue torn out and flesh cut in strips by  knives. Finally they poured coal oil on him and burned him to death. They  dragged his half-consumed trunk out of the flames, cut it open, extracted  his heart and liver, and sold slices for ten cents each for souvenirs, all  of which was published most promptly in the daily papers of Georgia and  boasted over by the people of that section.    Oct. 19, 1889, at Canton, Miss., Joseph Leflore was burned to death. A  house had been entered and its occupants murdered during the absence of  the husband and father. When the discovery was made, it was immediately  supposed that the crime was the work of a Negro, and the motive that of  assaulting white women.    Bloodhounds were procured and they made a round of the village and  discovered only one colored man absent from his home. This was taken to be  proof sufficient that he was the perpetrator of the deed. When he returned  home he was apprehended, taken into the yard of the house that had been  burned down, tied to a stake, and was slowly roasted to death.    Dec. 6, 1899, at Maysville, Ky., Wm. Coleman also was burned to death. He  was slowly roasted, first one foot and then the other, and dragged out of  the fire so that the torture might be prolonged. All of this without a  shadow of proof or scintilla of evidence that the man had committed the  crime.    Thus have the mobs of this country taken the lives of their victims within  the past ten years. In every single instance except one these burnings  were witnessed by from two thousand to fifteen thousand people, and no one  person in all these crowds throughout the country had the courage to raise  his voice and speak out against the awful barbarism of burning human  beings to death.

An interview of Miss Frances E.  Willard, the great apostle of temperance, the daughter of abolitionists  and a personal friend and helper of many individual colored people, has  been quoted in support of the utterance of this calumny against a weak and  defenseless race. In the _New York Voice_ of October 23, 1890, after a  tour in the South, where she was told all these things by the \"best white  people,\" she said: \"The grogshop is the Negro's center of power. Better  whisky and more of it is the rallying cry of great, dark-faced mobs. The  colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grogshop is its  center of power. The safety of woman, of childhood, the home, is menaced  in a thousand localities at this moment, so that men dare not go beyond  the sight of their own roof-tree.\"    These charges so often reiterated, have had the effect of fastening the  odium upon the race of a peculiar propensity for this foul crime. The  Negro is thus forced to a defense of his good name, and this chapter will  be devoted to the history of some of the cases where assault upon white  women by Negroes is charged. He is not the aggressor in this fight, but  the situation demands that the facts be given, and they will speak for  themselves. Of the 1,115 Negro men, women and children hanged, shot and  roasted alive from January 1, 1882, to January 1, 1894, inclusive, only  348 of that number were charged with rape. Nearly 700 of these persons  were lynched for any other reason which could be manufactured by a mob  wishing to indulge in a lynching bee.      A WHITE WOMAN'S FALSEHOOD    The _Cleveland, Ohio, Gazette_, January 16, 1892, gives an account of one  of these cases of \"rape.\"    Mrs. J.C. Underwood, the wife of a minister of Elyria, Ohio, accused an  Afro-American of rape. She told her husband that during his absence in  1888, stumping the state for the Prohibition Party, the man came to the  kitchen door, forced his way in the house and insulted her. She tried to  drive him out with a heavy poker, but he overpowered and chloroformed her,  and when she revived her clothing was torn and she was in a horrible  condition. She did not know the man, but could identify him. She  subsequently pointed out William Offett, a married man, who was arrested,  and, being in Ohio, was granted a trial.    The prisoner vehemently denied the charge of rape, but confessed he went  to Mrs. Underwood's residence at her invitation and was criminally  intimate with her at her request. This availed him nothing against the  sworn testimony of a minister's wife, a lady of the highest  respectability. He was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary,  December 14, 1888, for fifteen years. Sometime afterwards the woman's  remorse led her to confess to her husband that the man was innocent. These  are her words: \"I met Offett at the postoffice. It was raining. He was  polite to me, and as I had several bundles in my arms he offered to carry  them home for me, which he did. He had a strange fascination for me, and I  invited him to call on me. He called, bringing chestnuts and candy for the  children. By this means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then I  sat on his lap. He made a proposal to me and I readily consented. Why I  did so I do not know, but that I did is true. He visited me several times  after that and each time I was indiscreet. I did not care after the first  time. In fact I could not have resisted, and had no desire to resist.\"    When asked by her husband why she told him she had been outraged, she  said: \"I had several reasons for telling you. One was the neighbors saw  the fellow here, another was, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome  disease, and still another was that I feared I might give birth to a Negro  baby. I hoped to save my reputation by telling you a deliberate lie.\" Her  husband, horrified by the confession, had Offett, who had already served  four years, released and secured a divorce.    There have been many such cases throughout the South, with the difference  that the Southern white men in insensate fury wreak their vengeance  without intervention of law upon the Negro who consorts with their women.      TRIED TO MANUFACTURE AN OUTRAGE    The _Memphis (Tenn.) Ledger_, of June 8, 1892, has the following:      If Lillie Bailey, a rather pretty white girl, seventeen years of age,    who is now at the city hospital, would be somewhat less reserved about    her disgrace there would be some very nauseating details in the story of    her life. She is the mother of a little coon. The truth might reveal    fearful depravity or the evidence of a rank outrage. She will not    divulge the name of the man who has left such black evidence of her    disgrace, and in fact says it is a matter in which there can be no    interest to the outside world. She came to Memphis nearly three months    ago, and was taken in at the Woman's Refuge in the southern part of the    city. She remained there until a few weeks ago when the child was born.    The ladies in charge of the Refuge were horrified. The girl was at once    sent to the city hospital, where she has been since May 30. She is a    country girl. She came to Memphis from her father's farm, a short    distance from Hernando, Miss. Just when she left there she would not    say. In fact she says she came to Memphis from Arkansas, and says her    home is in that state. She is rather good looking, has blue eyes, a low    forehead and dark red hair. The ladies at the Woman's Refuge do not know    anything about the girl further than what they learned when she was an    inmate of the institution; and she would not tell much. When the child    was born an attempt was made to get the girl to reveal the name of the    Negro who had disgraced her, she obstinately refused and it was    impossible to elicit any information from her on the subject.    Note the wording: \"The truth might reveal fearful depravity or rank  outrage.\" If it had been a white child or if Lillie Bailey had told a  pitiful story of Negro outrage, it would have been a case of woman's  weakness or assault and she could have remained at the Woman's Refuge. But  a Negro child and to withhold its father's name and thus prevent the  killing of another Negro \"rapist\" was a case of \"fearful depravity.\" Had  she revealed the father's name, he would have been lynched and his taking  off charged to an assault upon a white woman.      BURNED ALIVE FOR ADULTERY    In Texarkana, Arkansas, Edward Coy was accused of assaulting a white  woman. The press dispatches of February 18, 1892, told in detail how he  was tied to a tree, the flesh cut from his body by men and boys, and after  coal oil was poured over him, the woman he had assaulted gladly set fire  to him, and 15,000 persons saw him burn to death. October 1, the _Chicago  Inter Ocean_ contained the following account of that horror from the pen  of the \"Bystander\" Judge Albion W. Tourgee--as the result of his  investigations:      1. The woman who was paraded as victim of violence was of bad character;    her husband was a drunkard and a gambler.      2. She was publicly reported and generally known to have been criminally    intimate with Coy for more than a year previous.      3. She was compelled by threats, if not by violence, to make the charge    against the victim.      4. When she came to apply the match Coy asked her if she would burn him    after they had \"been sweethearting\" so long.      5. A large majority of the \"superior\" white men prominent in the affair    are the reputed fathers of mulatto children.      These are not pleasant facts, but they are illustrative of the vital    phase of the so-called race question, which should properly be    designated an earnest inquiry as to the best methods by which religion,    science, law and political power may be employed to excuse injustice,    barbarity and crime done to a people because of race and color. There    can be no possible belief that these people were inspired by any    consuming zeal to vindicate God's law against miscegenationists of the    most practical sort. The woman was a willing partner in the victim's    guilt, and being of the \"superior\" race must naturally have been more    guilty.      NOT IDENTIFIED BUT LYNCHED    February 11, 1893, there occurred in Shelby County, Tennessee, the fourth  Negro lynching within fifteen months. The three first were lynched in the  city of Memphis for firing on white men in self-defense. This Negro,  Richard Neal, was lynched a few miles from the city limits, and the  following is taken from the _Memphis (Tenn.) Scimitar_:      As the _Scimitar_ stated on Saturday the Negro, Richard Neal, who raped    Mrs. Jack White near Forest Hill, in this county, was lynched by a mob    of about 200 white citizens of the neighborhood. Sheriff McLendon,    accompanied by Deputies Perkins, App and Harvey and a _Scimitar_    reporter, arrived on the scene of the execution about 3:30 in the    afternoon. The body was suspended from the first limb of a post oak tree    by a new quarter-inch grass rope. A hangman's knot, evidently tied by an    expert, fitted snugly under the left ear of the corpse, and a new hame    string pinioned the victim's arms behind him. His legs were not tied.    The body was perfectly limber when the Sheriff's posse cut it down and    retained enough heat to warm the feet of Deputy Perkins, whose road cart    was converted into a hearse. On arriving with the body at Forest Hill    the Sheriff made a bargain with a stalwart young man with a blonde    mustache and deep blue eyes, who told the _Scimitar_ reporter that he    was the leader of the mob, to haul "]]]
