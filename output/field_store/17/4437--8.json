We do not need to  look a second time to discover a striking likeness to the textile  system, and we ask, Is it also derived from a textile source? In the  first place let us seek within the art a reason for the peculiar  forms. In carving wood and in tracing figures upon it with pointed  tools the tendency would certainly be towards straight lines and  formal combinations; but in this work there would be a lack of  uniformity in execution and of persistency in narrow lines of  combination, such as result from the constant necessity of counting  and spacing in the textile art. In the presentation of natural forms  curved lines are called for, and there is nothing inherent in the  carver's art to forbid the turning of such lines with the graver or  knife. Graphic art would be realistic to an extent regulated by the  skill and habits of the artist. But, in reality, the geometric  character of this work is very pronounced, and we turn naturally  toward the textile art to ask whether in some way that art has not  exercised an influence. The textile arts of these peoples are highly  developed and were doubtless so in a degree from very early times, and  must have had a close relation with the various arts, and especially  so in the matter of ornament. Specific examples may be cited showing  the intimacy of wood carving to textilia. Bows, spears, arrows, &c.  are bound with textile materials to increase their strength. Knives  and other weapons are covered with textile sheaths and handles of  certain utensils are lashed on with twisted cords. In ceremonial  objects these textile features are elaborated for ornament and the  characteristic features of this ornament are transferred to associated  surfaces of wood and stone by the graver. A most instructive  illustration is seen in the ceremonial adzes so numerous in museums  (Fig. 356). The cords used primarily in attaching the haft are, after  loss of function, elaborately plaited and interwoven until they become  an important feature and assume the character of decoration. The heavy  wooden handles are elaborately carved, and the suggestions of figures  given by the interlaced cords are carried out in such detail that at a  little distance it is impossible to say where the real textile surface  ceases and the sculptured portion begins.    All things considered, I regard it as highly probable that much of the  geometric character exhibited in Polynesian decoration is due to  textile dominance. That these peoples are in the habit of employing  textile designs in non-textile arts is shown in articles of costume,  such as the tapa cloths, made from the bark of the mulberry tree,  which are painted or stamped in elaborate geometric patterns. This  transfer is also a perfectly natural one, as the ornament is applied  to articles having functions identical with the woven stuffs in which  the patterns originate, and, besides, the transfer is accomplished by  means of stamps themselves textile. Fig. 357 illustrates the  construction of these stamps and indicates just how the textile  character is acquired.    [Illustration: FIG. 356. Ceremonial adz, with carved ornament  imitating textile wrapping. Polynesian work.]    Textile materials are very generally associated with the human figure  in art, and thus sculpture, which deals chiefly with the human form,  becomes familiar with geometric motives and acquires them. Through  sculpture these motives enter architecture. But textile decoration  pervades architecture before the sculptor's chisel begins to carve  ornament in stone and before architecture has developed of itself the  rudiments of a system of surface embellishment. Textile art in mats,  covers, shelters, and draperies is intimately associated with floors  and walls of houses, and the textile devices are in time transferred  to the stone and plaster. The wall of an ancient Pueblo estufa, or  ceremonial chamber, built in the pre-esthetic period of architecture,  antedating, in stage of culture, the first known step in Egyptian art,  is encircled by a band of painted figures, borrowed, like those of the  pottery, from a textile source. The doorway or rather entrance to the  rude hovel of a Navajo Indian is closed by a blanket of native make,  unsurpassed in execution and exhibiting conventional designs of a high  order.    [Illustration: FIG. 357. Portion of a tapa stamp, showing its  subtextile character. A palm leaf is cut to the desired shape and the  patterns are sewed in or stitched on.]    [Illustration: FIG. 358. Design in stucco, exhibiting textile  characters.]    The ancient \"hall of the arabesques\" at Chimu, Peru, is decorated in  elaborate designs that could only have arisen in the textile art  (Fig. 358), and other equally striking examples are to be found in  other American countries. The classic surface decorations known and  used in Oriental countries from time immemorial prevailed in  indigenous American architecture at a stage of culture lower than any  known stage of classic art.    It may appear that I have advocated too strongly the claims of the  textile art to the parentage of geometric ornament and that the  conclusions reached are not entirely satisfactory, but I have  endeavored so to present the varied phenomena of the art that the  student may readily reach deductions of his own. A correspondingly  careful study of other branches of art will probably enable us finally  to form a just estimate of the relative importance of the forces and  tendencies concerned in the evolution of decoration.             *       *       *       *       *          INDEX      Alaskan Indians, illustration of ornamentation by 199  Ancon, Peru, examples of ornamentation from graves at 212, 230,    231, 236, 243, 248  Apache, illustrations of ornamentation by 198, 213, 223  British Guiana Indians, illustrations of ornamentation by 217  Chimu, Peru, ornamentation of \"hall of arabesques\" at 251, 252  Clallam Indians, illustrations of ornamentation by 207  Color in textile art 201, 202  Color phenomena in textile ornament 215-232  Form in textile art and its relation to ornament, with illustrations    from Indian work 196-201  Geometric design, relations of, to textile ornament 202-244  Holmes, W.

The  seed-lac is bleached by boiling with sodium or potassium carbonate,  alum, or borax, and then, if it is not pale enough, is further bleached  by exposure to sunlight. It is now dried, melted, and mixed with a  certain proportion of rosin or of orpiment (a sulphide of arsenic)  according to the purpose for which it is desired. After further  operations of melting and straining, the lac is melted and spread into  thin sheets to form ordinary shellac, or is melted and dropped on to a  smooth surface to form \"button-lac.\" Ordinary shellac almost invariably  contains some rosin, but good button-lac is free from this substance.  The presence of 5 per cent. of rosin in shellac can be detected by  dissolving in a little alcohol, pouring the solution into water, and  drying the fine impalpable powder which separates. This powder is  extracted with petroleum spirit, and the solution shaken with water  containing a trace of copper acetate. If rosin be present, the petroleum  spirit will be coloured emerald-green.    Borax, soda crystals, and ammonia are all used to dissolve shellac, and  it may be asked: Which of these is least injurious to wool? and why? How  is their action modified by the presence of dilute sulphuric acid in the  wool? I would say that soda crystals and ammonia are alkalis, and if  used strong, are sure to do a certain amount of injury to the fibre of  wool, and more if used hot than cold. Of the two, the ammonia will have  the least effect, especially if dilute, but borax is better than either.  The influence of a little sulphuric acid in the wool would be in the  direction of neutralising some of the ammonia or soda, and shellac, if  dissolved in the alkalis, would be to some extent precipitated on the  fibre, unless the alkali, soda or ammonia, were present in sufficient  excess to neutralise that sulphuric acid and to leave a sufficient  balance to keep the shellac in solution. Borax, which is a borate of  soda, would be so acted on by the sulphuric acid that some boric acid  would be set free, the sulphuric acid robbing some of that borax of its  soda. This boric acid would not be nearly so injurious to wool as  carbonate of soda or ammonia would.    The best solvent for shellac, however, in the preparation of the  stiffening and proofing mixture for hats, is probably wood spirit or  methylated spirit. A solution of shellac in wood spirit is indeed used  for the spirit-proofing of silk hats, and to some extent of felt hats,  and on the whole the best work, I believe, is done with it. Moreover,  borax is not a cheap agent, and being non-volatile it is all left behind  in the proofed material, whereas wood spirit or methylated spirit is a  volatile liquid, _i.e._ a liquid easily driven off in vapour, and after  application to the felt it may be almost all recovered again for re-use.  In this way I conceive the use of wood spirit would be both more  effective and also cheaper than that of borax, besides being most  suitable in the case of any kind of dyes and colours to be subsequently  applied to the hats.    _Wood Spirit._--Wood spirit, the pure form of which is methyl alcohol,  is one of the products of the destructive distillation of wood. The wood  is distilled in large iron retorts connected to apparatus for condensing  the distillation products. The heating is conducted slowly at first, so  that the maximum yield of the valuable products--wood acid (acetic acid)  and wood spirit--which distil at a low temperature, is obtained. When  the condensed products are allowed to settle, they separate into two  distinct layers, the lower one consisting of a thick, very dark tar,  whilst the upper one, much larger in quantity, is the crude wood acid  (containing also the wood spirit), and is reddish-yellow or  reddish-brown in colour. This crude wood acid is distilled, and the wood  spirit which distils off first is collected separately from the acetic  acid which afterwards comes over. The acid is used for the preparation  of alumina and iron mordants (see next lecture), or is neutralised with  lime, forming grey acetate of lime, from which, subsequently, pure  acetic acid or acetone is prepared. The crude wood spirit is mixed with  milk of lime, and after standing for several hours is distilled in a  rectifying still. The distillate is diluted with water, run off from any  oily impurities which are separated, and re-distilled once or twice  after treatment with quicklime.    _Stiffening and Proofing Process._--Before proceeding to discuss the  stiffening and proofing of hat forms or \"bodies,\" it will be well to  point out that it was in thoroughly grasping the importance of a  rational and scientific method of carrying out this process that  Continental hat manufacturers had been able to steal a march upon their  English rivals in competition as to a special kind of hat which sold  well on the Continent. There are, or ought to be, three aims in the  process of proofing and stiffening, all the three being of equal  importance. These are: first, to waterproof the hat-forms; second, to  stiffen them at the same time and by the same process; and the third,  the one the importance of which I think English hat manufacturers have  frequently overlooked, at least in the past, is to so proof and stiffen  the hat-forms as to leave them in a suitable condition for the  subsequent dyeing process. In proofing the felt, the fibres become  varnished over with a kind of glaze which is insoluble in water, and  this varnish or proof is but imperfectly removed from the ends of the  fibres on the upper surface of the felt. The consequence is a too slight  penetration of the dyestuff into the inner pores of the fibres; indeed,  in the logwood black dyeing of such proofed felt a great deal of the  colour becomes precipitated on the outside of the fibres--a kind of  process of \"smudging-on\" of a black pigment taking place. The subsequent  \"greening\" of the black hats after a short period of wear is simply due  to the ease with which such badly fixed dye rubs off, washes off, or  wears off, the brownish or yellowish substratum which gradually comes to  light, causing a greenish shade to at length appear. If we examine under  the microscope a pure unproofed fur fibre, its characteristic structure  is quite visible. Examination of an unproofed fibre dyed with logwood  black shows again the same characteristic structure with the dye inside  the fibre, colouring it a beautiful bluish-grey tint, the inner cellular  markings being black. A proofed fur fibre, on the other hand, when  examined under the microscope, is seen to be covered with a kind of  translucent glaze, which completely envelops it, and prevents the  beautiful markings showing the scaly structure of the fibre from being  seen. Finally, if we examine microscopically a proofed fibre which has  been dyed, or which we have attempted to dye, with logwood black, we  find that the fibre presents an appearance similar to that of rope which  has been drawn through some black pigment or black mud, and then dried.  It is quite plain that no lustrous appearance or good \"finish\" can be  expected from such material. Now how did the Continental hat  manufacturers achieve their success, both as regards dyeing either with  logwood black or with coal-tar colours, and also getting a high degree  of \"finish\"? They attained their object by rubbing the proofing varnish  on the inside of the hat bodies, in some cases first protecting the  outside with a gum-varnish soluble in water but resisting the  lac-varnish rubbed inside. Thus the proofing could never reach the  outside. On throwing the hat bodies, thus proofed by a logical and  scientific process, into the dye-bath, the gums on the outer surface are  dissolved and removed, and the dye strikes into a pure, clean fibre,  capable of a high degree of finish. This process, however, whilst very  good for the softer hats used on the Continent, is not so satisfactory  for the harder, stiffer headgear demanded in Great Britain. What was  needed was a process which would allow of a through-and-through proofing  and stiffening, and also of satisfactory dyeing of the stiffened and  proofed felt. This was accomplished by a process patented in 1887 by Mr.  F.W. Cheetham, and called the \"veneering\" process. The hat bodies,  proofed as hard as usual, are thrown into a \"bumping machine\" containing  hot water rendered faintly acid with sulphuric acid, and mixed with  short-staple fur or wool, usually of a finer quality than that of which  the hat bodies are composed. The hot acid water promotes in a high  degree the felting powers of the short-staple wool or fur, and, to a  lesser extent, the thinly proofed ends of the fibres projecting from  the surfaces of the proofed hat-forms. Thus the short-staple wool or fur  felts itself on to the fibres already forming part of the hat bodies,  and a new layer of pure, unproofed wool or fur is gradually wrought on  to the proofed surface. The hat-forms are then taken out and washed, and  can be dyed with the greatest ease and with excellent results, as will  be seen from the accompanying illustration (see Fig. 15). This  successful invention emphasises the value of the microscope in the  study of processes connected with textile fibres. I would strongly  advise everyone interested in hat manufacturing or similar industries to  make a collection of wool and fur fibres, and mount them on microscope  slides so as to form a kind of index collection for reference.
