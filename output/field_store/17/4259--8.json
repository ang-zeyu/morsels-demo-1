In backward parts of Europe a strange custom forbids the bride to speak  to her lord, as if in memory of a time when husband and wife were always  of alien tribes, and, as among the Caribs, spoke different languages.    In the Bulgarian 'Volkslied,' the Sun marries Grozdanka, a mortal girl.  Her mother addresses her thus:--       Grozdanka, mother's treasure mine,     For nine long years I nourished thee,     For nine months see thou do not speak     To thy first love that marries thee.    M. Dozon, who has collected the Bulgarian songs, says that this custom of  prolonged silence on the part of the bride is very common in Bulgaria,  though it is beginning to yield to a sense of the ludicrous. {74a}  In  Sparta and in Crete, as is well known, the bridegroom was long the victim  of a somewhat similar taboo, and was only permitted to seek the company  of his wife secretly, and in the dark, like the Iroquois described by  Lafitau.    Herodotus tells us (i. 146) that some of the old Ionian colonists  'brought no women with them, but took wives of the women of the Carians,  whose fathers they had slain.  Therefore the women made a law for  themselves, and handed it down to their daughters, that they should never  sit at meat with their husbands, and _that none should ever call her  husband by his name_.'  In precisely the same way, in Zululand the wife  may not mention her husband's name, just as in the Welsh fairy tale the  husband may not even know the name of his fairy bride, on pain of losing  her for ever.  These ideas about names, and freakish ways of avoiding the  use of names, mark the childhood of languages, according to Mr. Max  Muller, {74b} and, therefore, the childhood of Society.  The Kaffirs call  this etiquette 'Hlonipa.'  It applies to women as well as men.  A Kaffir  bride is not called by her own name in her husband's village, but is  spoken of as 'mother of so and so,' even before she has borne a child.  The universal superstition about names is at the bottom of this custom.  The Aleutian Islanders, according to Dall, are quite distressed when  obliged to speak to their wives in the presence of others.  The Fijians  did not know where to look when missionaries hinted that a man might live  under the same roof as his wife. {75a}  Among the Turkomans, for six  months, a year, or two years, a husband is only allowed to visit his wife  by stealth.    The number of these instances could probably be increased by a little  research.  Our argument is that the widely distributed myths in which a  husband or a wife transgresses some 'custom'--sees the other's face or  body, or utters the forbidden name--might well have arisen as tales  illustrating the punishment of breaking the rule.  By a very curious  coincidence, a Breton sailor's tale of the 'Cupid and Psyche' class is  confessedly founded on the existence of the rule of nuptial etiquette.  {75b}    In this story the son of a Boulogne pilot marries the daughter of the  King of Naz--wherever that may be.  In Naz a man is never allowed to see  the face of his wife till she has borne him a child--a modification of  the Futa rule.  The inquisitive French husband unveils his wife, and,  like Psyche in Apuleius, drops wax from a candle on her cheek.  When the  pair return to Naz, the king of that country discovers the offence of the  husband, and, by the aid of his magicians, transforms the Frenchman into  a monster.  Here we have the old formula--the infringement of a 'taboo,'  and the magical punishment--adapted to the ideas of Breton peasantry.  The  essential point of the story, for our purpose, is that the veiling of the  bride is 'the custom of women,' in the mysterious land of Naz.  'C'est  l'usage du pays: les maris ne voient leurs femmes sans voile que  lorsqu'elles sont devenues meres.'  Now our theory of the myth of Urvasi  is simply this: 'the custom of women,' which Pururavas transgresses, is  probably a traditional Aryan law of nuptial etiquette, l'usage du pays,  once prevalent among the people of India.    If our view be correct, then several rules of etiquette, and not one  alone, will be illustrated in the stories which we suppose the rules to  have suggested.  In the case of Urvasi and Pururavas, the rule was, not  to see the husband naked.  In 'Cupid and Psyche,' the husband was not to  be looked upon at all.  In the well-known myth of Melusine, the bride is  not to be seen naked.  Melusine tells her lover that she will only abide  with him dum ipsam nudam non viderit. {76a}  The same taboo occurs in a  Dutch Marchen. {76b}    We have now to examine a singular form of the myth, in which the strange  bride is not a fairy, or spiritual being, but an animal.  In this class  of story the husband is usually forbidden to perform some act which will  recall to the bride the associations of her old animal existence.  The  converse of the tale is the well-known legend of the Forsaken Merman.  The  king of the sea permits his human wife to go to church.  The ancient  sacred associations are revived, and the woman returns no more.       She will not come though you call all day     Come away, come away.    Now, in the tales of the animal bride, it is her associations with her  former life among the beasts that are not to be revived, and when they  are reawakened by the commission of some act which she has forbidden, or  the neglect of some precaution which she has enjoined, she, like Urvasi,  disappears.    * * * * *    The best known example of this variant of the tale is the story of Bheki,  in Sanskrit.  Mr. Max Muller has interpreted the myth in accordance with  his own method. {77}  His difficulty is to account for the belief that a  king might marry a frog.  Our ancestors, he remarks, 'were not idiots,'  how then could they tell such a story?  We might reply that our  ancestors, if we go far enough back, were savages, and that such stories  are the staple of savage myth.  Mr. Muller, however, holds that an  accidental corruption of language reduced Aryan fancy to the savage  level.  He explains the corruption thus: 'We find, in Sanskrit, that  Bheki, the frog, was a beautiful girl, and that one day, when sitting  near a well, she was discovered by a king, who asked her to be his wife.  She consented, _on condition that he should never show her a drop of  water_.  One day, being tired, she asked the king for water; the king  forgot his promise, brought water, and Bheki disappeared.'  This myth,  Mr. Muller holds, 'began with a short saying, such as that \"Bheki, the  sun, will die at the sight of water,\" as we should say that the sun will  set, when it approaches the water from which it rose in the morning.'  But  how did the sun come to be called Bheki, 'the frog'?  Mr. Muller supposes  that this name was given to the sun by some poet or fisherman.  He gives  no evidence for the following statement: 'It can be shown that \"frog\" was  used as a name for the sun.  Now at sunrise and sunset, when the sun was  squatting on the water, it was called the \"frog.\"'  At what historical  period the Sanskrit-speaking race was settled in seats where the sun rose  and set in water, we do not know, and 'chapter and verse' are needed for  the statement that 'frog' was actually a name of the sun.  Mr. Muller's  argument, however, is that the sun was called 'the frog,' that people  forgot that the frog and sun were identical, and that Frog, or Bheki, was  mistaken for the name of a girl to whom was applied the old saw about  dying at sight of water.  'And so,' says Mr. Muller, 'the change from sun  to frog, and from frog to man, which was at first due to the mere spell  of language, would in our nursery tales be ascribed to miraculous charms  more familiar to a later age.'  As a matter of fact, magical  metamorphoses are infinitely more familiar to the lowest savages than to  people in a 'later age.'  Magic, as Castren observes, 'belongs to the  lowest known stages of civilisation.'  Mr. Muller's theory, however, is  this--that a Sanskrit-speaking people, living where the sun rose out of  and set in some ocean, called the sun, as he touched the water, Bheki,  the frog, and said he would die at the sight of water.  They ceased to  call the sun the frog, or Bheki, but kept the saying, 'Bheki will die at  sight of water.'  Not knowing who or what Bheki might be, they took her  for a frog, who also was a pretty wench.  Lastly, they made the story of  Bheki's distinguished wedding and mysterious disappearance.  For this  interpretation, historical and linguistic evidence is not offered.  When  did a Sanskrit-speaking race live beside a great sea?  How do we know  that 'frog' was used as a name for 'sun'?    * * * * *    We have already given our explanation.  To the savage intellect, man and  beast are on a level, and all savage myth makes men descended from  beasts; while stories of the loves of gods in bestial shape, or the  unions of men and animals, incessantly occur.  'Unnatural' as these  notions seem to us, no ideas are more familiar to savages, and none recur  more frequently in Indo-Aryan, Scandinavian, and Greek mythology.  An  extant tribe in North-West America still claims descent from a frog.  The  wedding of Bheki and the king is a survival, in Sanskrit, of a tale of  this kind.  Lastly, Bheki disappears, when her associations with her old  amphibious life are revived in the manner she had expressly forbidden.    * * * * *    Our interpretation may be supported by an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#12)"],[1,"in. An advertisement may, however, profitably  be kept before the public constantly, and increased or diminished as  occasion requires.      CIRCULARS.    There are many well established firms who will not advertise in the  newspapers at all. They believe that the same amount of money spent  in circulars, catalogues, etc., sent direct to the persons whom they  desire to reach, pays better than newspaper advertising. This is more  direct, and affords the advertiser the opportunity of setting forth  his claims more fully. Circulars, cards, catalogues, etc., also afford  a means for the display of taste in their typographical arrangement  and appearance, and often times this has as much to do in making  an impression on the person who receives it, as the reading matter  contained therein. The printed circular goes out to the public as the  representative of the house; it should, therefore, in order to command  attention and respect, have about it, an air of appropriateness and  attraction. Such a circular will perhaps be carefully preserved for  years, while another which was of not enough importance, apparently,  to the proprietor or firm issuing it, to command their taste and  skill, will soon be thrown aside as of no importance to the person  receiving it.    Several circulars must often be sent in order to command the attention  and secure the custom of a person. Where circulars referring to the  same article are repeatedly sent out, the attention of the person who  receives them is likely to be arrested at last, and his response may  be made in the form of an order.    Perhaps thereafter he becomes a constant customer, buying himself, and  recommending his friends to do likewise.      CHARTS, CALENDARS, ETC.    An important idea in advertising is to enlist the services of others,  by making it to their interest to advertise your business. This is  often done by sending out charts, calendars, etc., containing useful  information, together with the advertisement. These, when properly  arranged and prepared in an attractive manner, will be placed in  a conspicuous place in the store, office, or home of the person  receiving them. Railway, insurance, and other corporations have vied  with each other in the elegance and attractiveness of their charts,  etc., until they have gone into the fine arts, and spared no expense  to captivate the public.      LETTERS.    More effectual than circulars, and nearest a personal interview, is a  personal letter. As an advertisement the letter impresses itself upon  the mind of the person receiving it, in an unusual way. A prominent  firm employed clerks, and had written several thousand letters, at  many times the cost of printed circulars, which they mailed throughout  the country, calling especial attention to their line of goods. Even  the two cent postage stamp, and the envelope being sealed, impresses  the person receiving it with the thought that it is of importance,  and one of the largest dry goods houses in Chicago, when issuing any  circular which they regard as special, seal the envelope and place a  two cent stamp thereon. They consider that this gives their circulars  a preference over ordinary printed matter. Certain it is, that the  public accept advertisements largely at the value and importance  attached to them by their owners.      DRUMMERS AND AGENTS.    Personal effort exceeds all other means of advertising, and  competition in many branches of business has become so strong in these  times, and the facilities for travel so excellent, that large numbers  of solicitors and agents traverse the country. Good personal address,  a thorough understanding of the business, a knowledge of human nature,  together with social qualities, constitute a good drummer.      HOW TO WRITE AN ADVERTISEMENT.    Before writing an advertisement, one should always place before his  mind what is the most important thing to impress upon the public. If  he is advertising an article of established trade, it is the name and  location of the house selling it which must be the more prominent, or  at least equally so with any other part; but if he be introducing some  new article, or seeking to extend the sale of something little known  or rare, these items are of far less importance, and the name of the  article itself should be more prominent. The advertisement should be  so constructed as to claim the attention of the reader, and retain  that attention until he has read it through. \"Excite but never  satisfy,\" is the principle pursued by many successful advertisers.    The advertisement should never contain anything repugnant to refined  taste, and nothing grotesque or ridiculous. The most meaning should be  condensed into the fewest possible words. The wording should often be  changed, and an attractive typography should be used. It is well to  choose an attractive heading, followed by fairly spaced paragraphs,  with appropriate sub-heads.             *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: HOW TO BE HANDSOME.]    HOW TO BE HANDSOME      Where is the woman who would not be beautiful? If such there be--but  no, she does not exist. From that memorable day when the Queen of  Sheba made a formal call on the late lamented King Solomon until the  recent advent of the Jersey Lily, the power of beauty has controlled  the fate of dynasties and the lives of men. How to be beautiful, and  consequently powerful, is a question of far greater importance to the  feminine mind than predestination or any other abstract subject.  If women are to govern, control, manage, influence and retain the  adoration of husbands, fathers, brothers, lovers or even cousins, they  must look their prettiest at all times.    All women cannot have good features, but they can look well, and it  is possible to a great extent to correct deformity and develop much of  the figure. The first step to good looks is good health, and the  first element of health is cleanliness. Keep clean--wash freely, bathe  regularly. All the skin wants is leave to act, and it takes care of  itself. In the matter of baths we do not strongly advocate a plunge  in ice-cold water; it takes a woman with clear grit and a strong  constitution to endure it. If a hot bath be used, let it come before  retiring, as there is less danger of taking cold afterwards; and,  besides, the body is weakened by the ablution and needs immediate  rest. It is well to use a flesh-brush, and afterwards rinse off the  soap-suds by briskly rubbing the body with a pair of coarse toilet  gloves. The most important part of a bath is the drying. Every part of  the body should be rubbed to a glowing redness, using a coarse crash  towel at the finish. If sufficient friction can not be given, a small  amount of bay rum applied with the palm of the hand will be found  efficacious. Ladies who have ample leisure and who lead methodical  lives, take a plunge or sponge bath three times a week, and a vapor  or sun bath every day. To facilitate this very beneficial practice, a  south or east apartment is desirable. The lady denudes herself, takes  a seat near the window, and takes in the warm rays of the sun. The  effect is both beneficial and delightful. If, however, she be of  a restless disposition, she may dance, instead of basking, in the  sunlight. Or, if she be not fond of dancing, she may improve the  shining hours by taking down her hair and brushing it, using sulphur  water, pulverized borax dissolved in alcohol, or some similar  dressing. It would be surprising to many ladies to see her carefully  wiping the separate locks on a clean, white towel until the dust  of the previous day is entirely removed. With such care it is not  necessary to wash the head, and the hair under this treatment is  invariably good.    One of the most useful articles of the toilet is a bottle of ammonia,  and any lady who has once learned its value will never be without it.  A few drops in the water takes the place of the usual amount of soap,  and cleans out the pores of the skin as well as a bleach will do.  Wash the face with a flesh-brush, and rub the lips well to tone their  color. It is well to bathe the eyes before putting in the spirits, and  if it is desirable to increase their brightness, this may be done by  dashing soapsuds into them. Always rub the eyes, in washing, toward  the nose. If the eyebrows are inclined to spread irregularly, pinch  the hairs together where thickest. If they show a tendency to meet,  this contact may be avoided by pulling out the hairs every morning  before the toilet.    The dash of Orientalism in costume and lace now turns a lady's  attention to her eyelashes, which are worthless if not long and  drooping. Indeed, so prevalent is the desire for this beautiful  feature that hair-dressers and ladies' artists have scores of  customers under treatment for invigorating their stunted eyelashes and  eyebrows. To obtain these fringed curtains, anoint the roots with a  balsam made of two drachms of nitric oxid of mercury mixed with one  of leaf lard. After an application wash the roots with a camel's hair  brush dipped in warm milk. Tiny scissors are used, with which the  lashes are carefully but slightly trimmed every other day. When  obtained, refrain from rubbing or even touching the lids with the  finger-nails. There is more beauty in a pair of well-kept eyebrows  and full, sweeping eyelashes than people are aware of, and a very  inattractive and lusterless eye assumes new beauty when it looks out  from beneath elongated fringes. Many ladies have a habit of rubbing  the corners of their eyes to remove the dust that will frequently  accumulate there. Unless this operation is done with little friction  it will be found that the growth of hair is very spare, and in that  case it will become necessary to pencil the barren corners. Instead  of putting cologne water on the handkerchief, which has come to be  considered a vulgarism among ladies of"]]]
