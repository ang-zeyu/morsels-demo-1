IV, V, VI (8; 9-12; 13) inform us also that the mukhya pra/n/a,  i.e. the vital air, is produced from Brahman; that it is a principle  distinct from air in general and from the pra/n/as discussed above; and  that it is minute (a/n/u).    Adhik. VII and VIII (14-16; 17-19) teach that the pra/n/as are  superintended and guided in their activity by special divinities, and  that they are independent principles, not mere modifications of the  mukhya pra/n/a.    Adhik. IX (20-22) declares that the evolution of names and forms (the  namarupavyakara/n/a) is the work, not of the individual soul, but of the  Lord.

I (1-7) teaches that the soul, when passing out of the body at  the time of death, remains invested with the subtle material elements  (bhutasukshma) which serve as an abode to the pra/n/as attached to the  soul.    Adhik. II (8-11) shows that, when the souls of those who had enjoyed the  reward of their good works in the moon descend to the earth in order to  undergo a new embodiment, there cleaves to them a remainder (anu/s/aya)  of their former deeds which determines the nature of the new embodiment.    Adhik. III (12-21) discusses the fate after death of those whom their  good works do not entitle to pass up to the moon.    Adhik. IV, V, VI (22; 23; 24-27) teach that the subtle bodies of the  souls descending from the moon through the ether, air, &c., do not  become identical with ether, air, &c., but only like them; that the  entire descent occupies a short time only; and that, when the souls  finally enter into plants and so on, they do not participate in the life  of the latter, but are merely in external contact with them.      PADA II.      Adhik. I (1-6) treats of the soul in the dreaming state. According to  /S/a@nkara the three first Sutras discuss the question whether the  creative activity ascribed to the soul in some scriptural passages  produces things as real as those by which the waking soul is surrounded,  or not; Sutra 3 settles the point by declaring that the creations of the  dreaming soul are mere 'Maya,' since they do not fully manifest the  character of real objects. Sutra 4 adds that dreams, although mere Maya,  yet have a prophetic quality. Sutras 5 and 6 finally reply to the  question why the soul, which after all is a part of the Lord and as such  participates in his excellencies, should not be able to produce in its  dreams a real creation, by the remark that the soul's knowledge and  power are obscured by its connexion with the gross body.    The considerably diverging interpretation given of this adhikara/n/a by  Ramanuja has the advantage of more closely connecting the Sutras with  each other. According to him the question is not whether the creations  of a dream are real or not, but whether they are the work of the  individual soul or of the Lord acting within the soul. Sutras 1 and 2  set forth the purvapaksha. The creations of dreams (are the work of the  individual soul); for thus Scripture declares: 'And the followers of  some /s/akas declare (the soul to be) a creator,' &c. The third Sutra  states the siddhanta view: 'But the creations of dreams are Maya, i.e.  are of a wonderful nature (and as such cannot be effected by the  individual soul), since (in this life) the nature (of the soul) is not  fully manifested.' Concerning the word 'maya,' Ramanuja remarks,  'maya/s/abdo hy a/sk/aryava/k/i janaka/s/ya kule jata devamayeva nirmita  ityadishu tatha dar/s/anat.' The three remaining Sutras are exhibited in  the /S/ri-bhashya in a different order, the fourth Sutra, according to  /S/a@nkara, being the sixth according to Ramanuja. Sutras 4 and 5  (according to Ramanuja's numeration) are explained by Ramanuja very much  in the same way as by /S/a@nkara; but owing to the former's statement of  the subject-matter of the whole adhikara/n/a they connect themselves  more intimately with the preceding Sutras than is possible on  /S/a@nkara's interpretation. In Sutra 6 (su/k/aka/s/ /k/a hi) Ramanuja  sees a deduction from the siddhanta of the adhikara/n/a, 'Because the  images of a dream are produced by the highest Lord himself, therefore  they have prophetic significance.'    Adhik. II teaches that in the state of deep dreamless sleep the soul  abides within Brahman in the heart.    Adhik. III (9) expounds the reasons entitling us to assume that the soul  awakening from sleep is the same that went to sleep.--Adhik. IV (9)  explains the nature of a swoon.    Adhik. V (11-21) is, according to /S/a@nkara, taken up with the question  as to the nature of the highest Brahman in which the individual soul is  merged in the state of deep sleep. Sutra 11 declares that twofold  characteristics (viz. absence and presence of distinctive attributes,  nirvi/s/eshatva and savi/s/eshatva) cannot belong to the highest Brahman  even through its stations, i.e. its limiting adjuncts; since all  passages which aim at setting forth Brahman's nature declare it to be  destitute of all distinctive attributes.--The fact, Sutra 12 continues,  that in many passages Brahman is spoken of as possessing distinctive  attributes is of no relevancy, since wherever there are mentioned  limiting adjuncts, on which all distinction depends, it is specially  stated that Brahman in itself is free from all diversity; and--Sutra 13  adds--in some places the assumption of diversity is specially objected  to.--That Brahman is devoid of all form (Sutra 14), is the pre-eminent  meaning of all Vedanta-texts setting forth Brahman's nature.--That  Brahman is represented as having different forms, as it were, is due to  its connexion with its (unreal) limiting adjuncts; just as the light of  the sun appears straight or crooked, as it were, according to the nature  of the things he illuminates (15).--The B/ri/hadara/n/yaka expressly  declares that Brahman is one uniform mass of intelligence (16); and the  same is taught in other scriptural passages and in Sm/ri/ti (l7).--At  the unreality of the apparent manifoldness of the Self, caused by the  limiting adjuncts, aim those scriptural passages in which the Self is  compared to the sun, which remains one although his reflections on the  surface of the water are many (18).--Nor must the objection be raised  that that comparison is unsuitable, because the Self is not material  like the sun, and there are no real upadhis separate from it as the  water is from the sun; for the comparison merely means to indicate that,  as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#12)"],[1,"of the German Ambassador, Prince Lichnowsky:         I reminded the German Ambassador that some days ago he had       expressed a personal hope that if need arose I would endeavor to       exercise moderating influence at St. Petersburg, but now I said       that, in view of the extraordinarily stiff character of the       Austrian note, the shortness of time allowed, and the wide scope of       the demands upon Servia, I felt quite helpless as far as Russia was       concerned, and I did not believe any power could exercise influence       alone.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 11.)    From a conversation of Grey with the Prince Lichnowsky, the German  Ambassador, on July 25:         Alone we could do nothing. The French Government were traveling       [this refers to the visit at St. Petersburg by Messrs. Poincare and       Viviani] at the moment, and I had had no time to consult them, and       could not, therefore, be sure of their views.--(British \"White       Paper\" No. 25.)    If Sir Edward Grey sincerely desired the maintenance of peace, he must  have had to use his entire influence at St. Petersburg to bring about  the stopping of the threatening military measures taken by Russia,  whereas he was waiting for the opinion of the French Government. He was  bound to do this, so much the more in view of the fact that he demanded  from Germany that it should exert its influence with Austria.    That this request of Grey's was complied with by Germany in so far as  it was in any way in accord with the alliance with Austria-Hungary, and  that in Vienna every effort was made to conciliate matters, is shown by  the assurance of the Chancellor; he declares:         In spite of this [the Austro-Hungarian Government having remarked       with full appreciation of our action that it had come too late] we       continued our mediatory efforts to the utmost and advised Vienna to       make any possible compromise consistent with the dignity of the       monarchy.--(German \"White Paper,\" Page 17, of NEW YORK TIMES       reprint.)    Grey well knew that Germany was doing all it could to mediate in Vienna.  He expressed his recognition and his joy over it on July 28 (\"Blue  Book,\" Page 67):         It is very satisfactory to hear from the German Ambassador here       that the German Government have taken action at Vienna in the sense       of the conversation recorded in my telegram of yesterday to       you.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 67.)[02]    Neither has Grey been left in the dark by the German side concerning the  difficulties, which by the Russian mobilization made every attempt to  mediate in Vienna abortive. Even on July 31 the British Ambassador in  Berlin telegraphed:         The Chancellor informs me that his efforts to preach peace and       moderation at Vienna have been seriously handicapped by the Russian       mobilization against Austria. He has done everything possible to       obtain his object at Vienna, perhaps even rather more than was       altogether palatable at the Ballplatz.--(British \"White Paper\" No.       108.)    England and Russia.    How, on the other hand, about Grey's action with Russia? From the very  beginning one should have had a right to expect that, as Germany acted  in Vienna, thus France, if it was active in Grey's spirit, would be  working in St. Petersburg for peace. Of this no trace whatsoever can be  found. The French Government thus far has not published any series of  documents concerning its activity during the crisis, and neither in the  Russian \"Orange Book\" nor in the English \"Blue Book\" is anything  mentioned of the mediating activity on the part of France.    On the contrary, the latter power, wherever she puts in an  appearance--as for instance in the conversation of the English  Ambassador in St. Petersburg with his French colleague and M. Sazonof,  as mentioned above--appears as fully identical with Russia.    It is also stated on July 24:         The French Ambassador gave me to understand that France would       fulfill all the obligations entailed by her alliance with Russia if       necessity arose, besides supporting Russia strongly in all       diplomatic negotiations.... It seems to me from the language held,       by French Ambassador that even if we decline to join them, France       and Russia are determined to make a strong stand.--(British \"White       Paper\" No. 6.)    One should think that Grey, who in view of this could not possibly  expect an influence for peace being brought to bear by France, but only  a strengthening of the Russian desire for aggression, now would have  acted in the most energetic manner in St. Petersburg for the maintenance  of peace.    In reality, however, during the days that still remained, aside from a  weak and in St. Petersburg absolutely ineffective advice to postpone  mobilization, he did nothing whatsoever, and later placed himself in a  manner constantly more recognizable on the side of Russia.    The claim that the time limit given by the Austrian note to Servia was  the cause of the war, that Grey's mediation had only miscarried owing to  the haste of Germany, is disproved by the British documents  themselves. De Bunsen on July 26 telegraphed to Grey from Vienna:         Russian Ambassador just returned from leave, thinks that       Austro-Hungarian Government are determined on war and that it is       impossible for Russia to remain indifferent. He does not propose to       press for more time in the sense of your telegram of the 25th       inst.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 40.)    Therefore Russia has paid little attention to the very shy and timid  efforts to maintain peace by the London Secretary of State, even where  these were concerned in the attempt to change the position taken by  Austria.    Another proof: Sazonof on July 27 sent a telegram to the Russian  Ambassador in London which the latter transmitted to Grey, and which  concerns itself with the much mentioned proposition of the latter to  have the conflict investigated by a conference of the four great powers  not immediately concerned.    Russian Sincerity Questioned.    The conference plan was declined without much hesitation and openly by  Germany, because it was compelled to see therein an attempt to place  Austria before a European court of arbitration, and because it knew the  serious determination of its ally in this matter. But did Russia really  want the conference? Minister Sazonof declares:         I replied to the [British] Ambassador that I have begun       conversations with the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, under       conditions which I hope may be favorable. I have not, however,       received as yet any reply to the proposal made by me for revising       the note between the two Cabinets.--(British \"White Paper\" No.       53.)    Here it is shown plainly how little the conference plan was after the  heart of the Russians. Had they accepted it it would have had to be done  immediately. As soon as the situation had grown very much more serious  by the failure of the negotiations with Austria-Hungary there would have  been no more time for this.[03]    A telegram of the English Ambassador in St. Petersburg, dated July 27,  (British \"White Paper\" No. 55,) shows how this conference was expected  to be conducted in St. Petersburg:         His Excellency [Sazonof] said he was perfectly ready to stand aside       if the powers accepted the proposal for a conference, but he       trusted that you would keep in touch with the Russian Ambassador in       the event of its taking place.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 55.)    Russian shrewdness evidently expected to control the conference by  keeping in touch with Grey, who of course would have been the Chairman.  The dispatches of his own Ambassadors lying before him should have  enabled the Secretary of State to see the perfidy of the Russian policy.  Buchanan wrote on the 28th from St. Petersburg:         ... and asked him whether he would be satisfied with the assurance       which the Austrian Ambassador had, I understood, been instructed to       give in respect to Servia's integrity and independence.... In reply       his Excellency stated that if Servia were attacked Russia would not       be satisfied with any engagement which Austria might take on these       two points....--(British \"White Paper\" No. 72.)    Entirely in contrast herewith is one report of the British  representative in Vienna, dated Aug. 1, and speaking of a conversation  with the Russian Ambassador there:         Russia would, according to the Russian Ambassador, be satisfied       even now with assurance respecting Servian integrity and       independence. He said that Russia had no intention to attack       Austria.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 141.)    What, then, may one ask, was the opinion which Sir Edward Grey had  formed concerning Russia's real intentions? He learns from Russian  sources and notes faithfully that Russia will accept Austrian guarantees  for independence of Servia, and also that it will not accept such  guarantees. It is the same duplicity which Russia, when its own  mobilization was concerned, showed toward Germany. Did Sir Edward not  notice this duplicity, or did he not wish to notice it? If the documents  of the English Government have not been selected with the purpose to  confuse, then in London the decision to take part in the war does not  seem to have been a certainty at the beginning. We have seen that  Ambassador Buchanan in St. Petersburg on July 24 gave the Russian  Minister to understand that England was not of a mind to go to war on  account of Servia. This position, taken by the Ambassador, was approved  by Sir Edward Grey on the following day in the following words:         I entirely approve what you said ... and I cannot promise more on       behalf of the Government.--(British \"White Paper\" No. 24.)    Based upon these instructions, Sir George Buchanan, even on July 27,"]]]
