'Tis of the latest cut, my strain,  And all strike in at each refrain!         (_He sings_.)         There was a rat in the cellar-nest,       Whom fat and butter made smoother:       He had a paunch beneath his vest       Like that of Doctor Luther.       The cook laid poison cunningly,       And then as sore oppressed was he       As if he had love in his bosom.         CHORUS (_shouting_)         As if he had love in his bosom!         BRANDER         He ran around, he ran about,       His thirst in puddles laving;       He gnawed and scratched the house throughout.       But nothing cured his raving.       He whirled and jumped, with torment mad,       And soon enough the poor beast had,       As if he had love in his bosom.         CHORUS         As if he had love in his bosom!         BRANDER         And driven at last, in open day,       He ran into the kitchen,       Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay,       In the last convulsion twitching.       Then laughed the murderess in her glee:       \"Ha! ha! he's at his last gasp,\" said she,       \"As if he had love in his bosom!\"    CHORUS         As if he had love in his bosom!    SIEBEL    How the dull fools enjoy the matter!  To me it is a proper art  Poison for such poor rats to scatter.    BRANDER    Perhaps you'll warmly take their part?    ALTMAYER    The bald-pate pot-belly I have noted:  Misfortune tames him by degrees;  For in the rat by poison bloated  His own most natural form he sees.    FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES    MEPHISTOPHELES    Before all else, I bring thee hither  Where boon companions meet together,  To let thee see how smooth life runs away.  Here, for the folk, each day's a holiday:  With little wit, and ease to suit them,  They whirl in narrow, circling trails,  Like kittens playing with their tails?  And if no headache persecute them,  So long the host may credit give,  They merrily and careless live.    BRANDER    The fact is easy to unravel,  Their air's so odd, they've just returned from travel:  A single hour they've not been here.    FROSCH    You've verily hit the truth! Leipzig to me is dear:  Paris in miniature, how it refines its people!    SIEBEL    Who are the strangers, should you guess?    FROSCH    Let me alone! I'll set them first to drinking,  And then, as one a child's tooth draws, with cleverness,  I'll worm their secret out, I'm thinking.  They're of a noble house, that's very clear:  Haughty and discontented they appear.    BRANDER    They're mountebanks, upon a revel.    ALTMAYER    Perhaps.    FROSCH    Look out, I'll smoke them now!    MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)    Not if he had them by the neck, I vow,  Would e'er these people scent the Devil!    FAUST  Fair greeting, gentlemen!    SIEBEL    Our thanks: we give the same.  (_Murmurs, inspecting_ MEPHISTOPHELES _from the side_.)  In one foot is the fellow lame?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Is it permitted that we share your leisure?  In place of cheering drink, which one seeks vainly here,  Your company shall give us pleasure.    ALTMAYER    A most fastidious person you appear.      FROSCH    No doubt 'twas late when you from Rippach started?  And supping there with Hans occasioned your delay?    MEPHISTOPHELES    We passed, without a call, to-day.  At our last interview, before we parted  Much of his cousins did he speak, entreating  That we should give to each his kindly greeting.    (_He bows to_ FROSCH.)    ALTMAYER (_aside_)    You have it now! he understands.    SIEBEL    A knave sharp-set!    FROSCH    Just wait awhile: I'll have him yet.    MEPHISTOPHELES    If I am right, we heard the sound  Of well-trained voices, singing chorus;  And truly, song must here rebound  Superbly from the arches o'er us.    FROSCH    Are you, perhaps, a virtuoso?    MEPHISTOPHELES    O no! my wish is great, my power is only so-so.    ALTMAYER    Give us a song!    MEPHISTOPHELES    If you desire, a number.    SIEBEL    So that it be a bran-new strain!    MEPHISTOPHELES    We've just retraced our way from. Spain,  The lovely land of wine, and song, and slumber.    (_Sings_.)    There was a king once reigning,  Who had a big black flea--    FROSCH    Hear, hear! A flea! D'ye rightly take the jest?  I call a flea a tidy guest.    MEPHISTOPHELES (_sings_)         There was a king once reigning,       Who had a big black flea,       And loved him past explaining,       As his own son were he.       He called his man of stitches;       The tailor came straightway:       Here, measure the lad for breeches.       And measure his coat, I say!    BRANDER    But mind, allow the tailor no caprices:  Enjoin upon him, as his head is dear,  To most exactly measure, sew and shear,  So that the breeches have no creases!    MEPHISTOPHELES         In silk and velvet gleaming       He now was wholly drest--       Had a coat with ribbons streaming,       A cross upon his breast.       He had the first of stations,       A minister's star and name;       And also all his relations       Great lords at court became.         And the lords and ladies of honor       Were plagued, awake and in bed;       The queen she got them upon her,       The maids were bitten and bled.       And they did not dare to brush them,       Or scratch them, day or night:       We crack them and we crush them,       At once, whene'er they bite.         CHORUS (_shouting_)         We crack them and we crush them,       At once, whene'er they bite!    FROSCH  Bravo! bravo! that was fine.    SIEBEL    Every flea may it so befall!    BRANDER    Point your fingers and nip them all!    ALTMAYER    Hurrah for Freedom! Hurrah for wine!    MEPHISTOPHELES    I fain would drink with you, my glass to Freedom clinking,  If 'twere a better wine that here I see you drinking.    SIEBEL    Don't let us hear that speech again!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Did I not fear the landlord might complain,  I'd treat these worthy guests, with pleasure,  To some from out our cellar's treasure.    SIEBEL    Just treat, and let the landlord me arraign!    FROSCH    And if the wine be good, our praises shall be ample.  But do not give too very small a sample;  For, if its quality I decide,  With a good mouthful I must be supplied.    ALTMAYER (_aside_)    They're from the Rhine! I guessed as much, before.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Bring me a gimlet here!    BRANDER    What shall therewith be done?  You've not the casks already at the door?    ALTMAYER    Yonder, within the landlord's box of tools, there's one!    MEPHISTOPHELES (_takes the gimlet_)    (_To_ FROSCH.)    Now, give me of your taste some intimation.    FROSCH    How do you mean? Have you so many kinds?    MEPHISTOPHELES    The choice is free: make up your minds.    ALTMAYER (_to_ FROSCH)    Aha! you lick your chops, from sheer anticipation.    FROSCH    Good! if I have the choice, so let the wine be Rhenish!  Our Fatherland can best the sparkling cup replenish.    MEPHISTOPHELES    (_boring a hole in the edge of the table, at the place where_  FROSCH _sits_)    Get me a little wax, to make the stoppers, quick!    ALTMAYER    Ah! I perceive a juggler's trick.    MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ BRANDER)    And you?    BRANDER    Champagne shall be my wine,  And let it sparkle fresh and fine!    MEPHISTOPHELES    (_bores: in the meantime one has made the wax stoppers, and  plugged the holes with them_.)    BRANDER    What's foreign one can't always keep quite clear of,  For good things, oft, are not so near;  A German can't endure the French to see or hear of,  Yet drinks their wines with hearty cheer.    SIEBEL    (_as_ MEPHISTOPHELES _approaches his seat_)  For me, I grant, sour wine is out of place;  Fill up my glass with sweetest, will you?    MEPHISTOPHELES (_boring_)    Tokay shall flow at once, to fill you!    ALTMAYER    No--look me, Sirs, straight in the face!  I see you have your fun at our expense.    MEPHISTOPHELES    O no! with gentlemen of such pretence,  That were to venture far, indeed.  Speak out, and make your choice with speed!  With what a vintage can I serve you?    ALTMAYER    With any--only satisfy our need.    (_After the holes have been bored and plugged_)    MEPHISTOPHELES (_with singular gestures_)         Grapes the vine-stem bears,       Horns the he-goat wears!       The grapes are juicy, the vines are wood,       The wooden table gives wine as good!       Into the depths of Nature peer,--       Only believe there's a miracle here!    Now draw the stoppers, and drink your fill!    ALL    (_as they draw out the stoppers, and the wine which has been  desired flows into the glass of each)_    O beautiful fountain, that flows at will!    MEPHISTOPHELES    But have a care that you nothing spill!    (_They drink repeatedly_.)    ALL (_sing_)         As 'twere five hundred hogs, we feel       So cannibalic jolly!    MEPHISTOPHELES    See, now, the race is happy--it is free!    FAUST    To leave them is my inclination.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Take notice, first! their bestiality  Will make a brilliant demonstration.    SIEBEL    (_drinks carelessly: the wine spills upon the earth, and turns to  flame_)    Help! Fire! Help! Hell-fire is sent!    MEPHISTOPHELES (_charming away the flame)_    Be quiet, friendly element!    (_To the revellers_)    A bit of purgatory 'twas for this time, merely.    SIEBEL    What mean you? Wait!--you'll pay for't dearly!  You'll know us, to your detriment.    FROSCH    Don't try that game a second time upon us!    ALTMAYER    I think we'd better send him packing quietly.    SIEBEL    What, Sir! you dare to make so free,  And play your hocus-pocus on us!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Be still, old wine-tub.    SIEBEL    Broomstick, you!  You face it out, impertinent and heady?    BRANDER    Just wait! a shower of blows is ready.    ALTMAYER    (_draws a stopper out of the table: fire flies in his face_.)  I burn! I burn!    SIEBEL    'Tis magic! Strike--  The knave is outlawed! Cut him as you like!

The late Captain Crewe--\"    Here Miss Minchin stopped him with a gasp.    \"The LATE Captain Crewe!\" she cried out.  \"The LATE! You don't come to  tell me that Captain Crewe is--\"    \"He's dead, ma'am,\" Mr. Barrow answered with jerky brusqueness.  \"Died  of jungle fever and business troubles combined.  The jungle fever might  not have killed him if he had not been driven mad by the business  troubles, and the business troubles might not have put an end to him if  the jungle fever had not assisted.  Captain Crewe is dead!\"    Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again.  The words he had spoken  filled her with alarm.    \"What WERE his business troubles?\" she said.  \"What WERE they?\"    \"Diamond mines,\" answered Mr. Barrow, \"and dear friends--and ruin.\"    Miss Minchin lost her breath.    \"Ruin!\" she gasped out.    \"Lost every penny.  That young man had too much money.  The dear friend  was mad on the subject of the diamond mine.  He put all his own money  into it, and all Captain Crewe's.  Then the dear friend ran  away--Captain Crewe was already stricken with fever when the news came.  The shock was too much for him.  He died delirious, raving about his  little girl--and didn't leave a penny.\"    Now Miss Minchin understood, and never had she received such a blow in  her life.  Her show pupil, her show patron, swept away from the Select  Seminary at one blow.  She felt as if she had been outraged and robbed,  and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr. Barrow were equally to blame.    \"Do you mean to tell me,\" she cried out, \"that he left NOTHING!  That  Sara will have no fortune!  That the child is a beggar!  That she is  left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress?\"    Mr. Barrow was a shrewd businessman, and felt it as well to make his  own freedom from responsibility quite clear without any delay.    \"She is certainly left a beggar,\" he replied.  \"And she is certainly  left on your hands, ma'am--as she hasn't a relation in the world that  we know of.\"    Miss Minchin started forward.  She looked as if she was going to open  the door and rush out of the room to stop the festivities going on  joyfully and rather noisily that moment over the refreshments.    \"It is monstrous!\" she said.  \"She's in my sitting room at this moment,  dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats, giving a party at my  expense.\"    \"She's giving it at your expense, madam, if she's giving it,\" said Mr.  Barrow, calmly.  \"Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible for anything.  There never was a cleaner sweep made of a man's fortune. Captain Crewe  died without paying OUR last bill--and it was a big one.\"    Miss Minchin turned back from the door in increased indignation.  This  was worse than anyone could have dreamed of its being.    \"That is what has happened to me!\" she cried.  \"I was always so sure of  his payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the  child.  I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous  fantastic wardrobe.  The child was to have anything she wanted.  She  has a carriage and a pony and a maid, and I've paid for all of them  since the last cheque came.\"    Mr. Barrow evidently did not intend to remain to listen to the story of  Miss Minchin's grievances after he had made the position of his firm  clear and related the mere dry facts.  He did not feel any particular  sympathy for irate keepers of boarding schools.    \"You had better not pay for anything more, ma'am,\" he remarked, \"unless  you want to make presents to the young lady.  No one will remember you.  She hasn't a brass farthing to call her own.\"    \"But what am I to do?\" demanded Miss Minchin, as if she felt it  entirely his duty to make the matter right.  \"What am I to do?\"    \"There isn't anything to do,\" said Mr. Barrow, folding up his  eyeglasses and slipping them into his pocket.  \"Captain Crewe is dead.  The child is left a pauper.  Nobody is responsible for her but you.\"    \"I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible!\"    Miss Minchin became quite white with rage.    Mr. Barrow turned to go.    \"I have nothing to do with that, madam,\" he said uninterestedly.  \"Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible.  Very sorry the thing has  happened, of course.\"    \"If you think she is to be foisted off on me, you are greatly  mistaken,\" Miss Minchin gasped.  \"I have been robbed and cheated; I  will turn her into the street!\"    If she had not been so furious, she would have been too discreet to say  quite so much.  She saw herself burdened with an extravagantly  brought-up child whom she had always resented, and she lost all  self-control.    Mr. Barrow undisturbedly moved toward the door.    \"I wouldn't do that, madam,\" he commented; \"it wouldn't look well.  Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment.  Pupil bundled out penniless and without friends.\"    He was a clever business man, and he knew what he was saying. He also  knew that Miss Minchin was a business woman, and would be shrewd enough  to see the truth.  She could not afford to do a thing which would make  people speak of her as cruel and hard-hearted.    \"Better keep her and make use of her,\" he added.  \"She's a clever  child, I believe.  You can get a good deal out of her as she grows  older.\"    \"I will get a good deal out of her before she grows older!\" exclaimed  Miss Minchin.    \"I am sure you will, ma'am,\" said Mr. Barrow, with a little sinister  smile.  \"I am sure you will.  Good morning!\"    He bowed himself out and closed the door, and it must be confessed that  Miss Minchin stood for a few moments and glared at it.  What he had  said was quite true.  She knew it.  She had absolutely no redress. Her  show pupil had melted into nothingness, leaving only a friendless,  beggared little girl.  Such money as she herself had advanced was lost  and could not be regained.    And as she stood there breathless under her sense of injury, there fell  upon her ears a burst of gay voices from her own sacred room, which had  actually been given up to the feast. She could at least stop this.    But as she started toward the door it was opened by Miss Amelia, who,  when she caught sight of the changed, angry face, fell back a step in  alarm.    \"What IS the matter, sister?\" she ejaculated.    Miss Minchin's voice was almost fierce when she answered:    \"Where is Sara Crewe?\"    Miss Amelia was bewildered.    \"Sara!\" she stammered.  \"Why, she's with the children in your room, of  course.\"    \"Has she a black frock in her sumptuous wardrobe?\"--in bitter irony.    \"A black frock?\"  Miss Amelia stammered again.  \"A BLACK one?\"    \"She has frocks of every other color.  Has she a black one?\"    Miss Amelia began to turn pale.    \"No--ye-es!\" she said.  \"But it is too short for her.  She has only the  old black velvet, and she has outgrown it.\"    \"Go and tell her to take off that preposterous pink silk gauze, and put  the black one on, whether it is too short or not.  She has done with  finery!\"    Then Miss Amelia began to wring her fat hands and cry.    \"Oh, sister!\" she sniffed.  \"Oh, sister!  What CAN have happened?\"    Miss Minchin wasted no words.    \"Captain Crewe is dead,\" she said.  \"He has died without a penny. That  spoiled, pampered, fanciful child is left a pauper on my hands.\"    Miss Amelia sat down quite heavily in the nearest chair.    \"Hundreds of pounds have I spent on nonsense for her.  And I shall  never see a penny of it.  Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers.  Go and make her change her frock at once.\"    \"I?\" panted Miss Amelia.  \"M-must I go and tell her now?\"    \"This moment!\" was the fierce answer.  \"Don't sit staring like a goose.  Go!\"    Poor Miss Amelia was accustomed to being called a goose.  She knew, in  fact, that she was rather a goose, and that it was left to geese to do  a great many disagreeable things.  It was a somewhat embarrassing thing  to go into the midst of a room full of delighted children, and tell the  giver of the feast that she had suddenly been transformed into a little  beggar, and must go upstairs and put on an old black frock which was  too small for her.  But the thing must be done. This was evidently not  the time when questions might be asked.    She rubbed her eyes with her handkerchief until they looked quite red.  After which she got up and went out of the room, without venturing to  say another word.  When her older sister looked and spoke as she had  done just now, the wisest course to pursue was to obey orders without  any comment.  Miss Minchin walked across the room. She spoke to herself  aloud without knowing that she was doing it. During the last year the  story of the diamond mines had suggested all sorts of possibilities to  her.  Even proprietors of seminaries might make fortunes in stocks,  with the aid of owners of mines. And now, instead of looking forward to  gains, she was left to look back upon losses.    \"The Princess Sara, indeed!\" she said.  \"The child has been pampered as  if she were a QUEEN.\" She was sweeping angrily past the corner table as  she said it, and the next moment she started at the sound of a loud,  sobbing sniff which issued from under the cover.    \"What is that!\" she exclaimed angrily.  The loud, sobbing sniff was  heard again, and she stooped and raised the hanging folds of the table"]]]
