I,\"--again he stopped; again he burst forth,--\"I would  sooner have died myself than seen such angel graces laid low. Let my  emotion be proof of what I say. It was a man of the hardest heart who  killed her.\"    \"It would seem so.\"    It was the Coroner who spoke. He was nonplussed; and Mr. Gryce no less  so. Never had either of them been confronted by a blinder or more  bewildering case. An incomprehensible crime and a suspect it was  impossible to associate with a deed of blood! There must be some other  explanation of the mournful circumstance they were considering. There had  been twenty or more people in the building, but--and here was the rub--if  the chart which they had drawn up was correct and the calculations which  they had drawn from it were to be depended upon, this man was the only  person who had been in this gallery when the arrow was shot.    With a side glance at Mr. Gryce, who seemed content to remain silent in  the background, Dr. Price turned again to Mr. Travis.    \"Your admiration of the young lady must have been as sudden as it was  strong. Or possibly you had seen her before you hid behind the pedestal.  Had you, Mr. Travis? She was a charming child; perhaps you had been  attracted by her beauty before you even entered the galleries.\"    Instantly the man was another being.    \"You are right,\" he acquiesced with undue alacrity. \"I had seen her  crossing the court. Her beauty was heavenly. I am a gentleman, but I  followed her. When she moved, I moved; and when she went upstairs, I  followed her. But I would not offend. I kept behind,--far behind  her,--and when she entered the gallery on one side, I took pains to enter  it on the other. This is how I came to be looking in her direction when  she was struck down. You see, I speak with candor; I open my whole  heart.\"    Dr. Price, stroking his long beard, eyed the man with a thoughtful air  which changed to one of renewed inquiry. Instead of being convinced by  this outburst, he was conscious of a new and deepening distrust. The  transition from a low state of feeling to one so feverishly eager had  been too sudden. The avidity with which this man just off ship had made  a grasp at the offered explanation had been too marked; it lacked  sincerity and could impose on no one. Of this he seemed himself aware,  for again the ready flush ran from forehead to neck, and with a  deprecatory glance which included the silent detective he vehemently  exclaimed:    \"I am poor at a lie. I see that you will have the whole truth. It was on  her account I crossed the ocean. It was by dogging her innocent steps  that I came to the museum this morning. I am a man of means, and I can do  as I please. When I said that I had never exchanged a word with her, I  spoke the truth. I never have; yet my interest in her was profound. I  have never seen any other girl or woman whom I was anxious to make my  wife. I hoped to meet and woo her in this country. I had no opportunity  for doing so in my own. I did not see her till a night or so before she  sailed, and then it was at the theater, where she sat with some friends  in an adjoining box. She talked, and I heard what she said. She was  leaving England. She was going to America to live; and she mentioned the  steamer on which she expected to sail. It may strike you as impetuous,  unnatural in an Englishman, and all that, but next morning I secured my  passage on that same ship. As I have just said, I am my own master and  can do as I please, and I pleased to do that. But for all the opportunity  which a voyage sometimes gives, I did not succeed in making her  acquaintance on shipboard, much as I desired it. I was ill for the first  three days and timorous the rest. I could only watch her moving about the  decks and wait for the happy moment in which I might be able to do her  some service. But that moment never came, and now it never will come.\"    The mournfulness with which this was uttered seemed genuine. The Coroner  was silenced by it, and it was left to Mr. Gryce to take up the  conversation. This he did with the same show of respect evinced by Dr.  Price.    \"We are obliged to you for your confidence,\" said he. \"Of course you can  tell us this young girl's name.\"    \"Angeline--Angeline Willetts. I saw it in the list of passengers.\"    \"What ship?\"    \"The _Castania_, from Southampton.\"    \"We are greatly obliged to you for this information. It gives us the  much-wanted clue to her identity. Angeline Willetts! Whom was she with?\"    \"A Madame Duclos, a French lady. I once spoke to _her_.\"    \"You did? And what did you say?\"    \"I bade her good morning as we were passing on the main-deck stairs. But  she did not answer, and I was not guilty of the impertinence again.\"    \"I see. Such, then, was the situation up to this morning. But since? How  did it happen that a young girl, six hours after landing in this country,  should come to a place like this without a chaperon?\"    \"I don't know what brought her here; I can only tell you why I came. When  she left the dock, I was standing near enough to hear the orders Madame  Duclos gave on entering a cab. Naturally, mine were the same. I have been  in New York before, and I knew the hotel. If you will consult the  Universal's register for the day, you will find my name in it under hers.  You will understand why I shrank from confessing to this fact before. I  held her in such honor--I was and am so anxious that no shadow should  fall upon her innocence from my poor story of secret and unrecognized  devotion. She knew nothing of what led me to follow every step she took.  I was a witness of her fate, but that is all the connection between us.  I hope you believe me.\"    It would be difficult not to, in face of his direct gaze, from which all  faltering had now vanished. Yet the matter not being completely thrashed  out, Mr. Gryce felt himself obliged to say in answer to this last:    \"We see no reason to doubt your word or your story, Mr. Travis. All that  you have said is possible. But how about your following the young girl  here? How did that come about?\"    \"That was occasioned by my anxiety for her--an anxiety which seems to  have been only too well-founded.\"    \"How? What?\" Both of the officials showed a greatly increased interest.  \"Please explain yourself, Mr. Travis. What reason had you for any such  feeling in regard to a person with whom you had held no conversation?  Anything which you saw or heard at the hotel?\"    \"Yes. I was sitting in the foyer. I knew that the ladies were in the  house, but I had not seen them. I was anxious to do so (see, I am telling  all) and was watching the door of the lift from behind my journal, when  they both stepped out. Miss Willetts was dressed for the street, but  Madame Duclos was not, which seemed very strange to me. But I felt no  concern till I caught some fragments of what Madame said in passing me.  She spoke in French, a language I understand, and she was exclaiming  over her misfortune at not being allowed to accompany her young charge to  whatever place she was going. It was bad, bad, she cried, and she would  not have a moment's peace till her dear Angeline got back. Anxiety of  this kind was natural in a Frenchwoman not accustomed to see a young lady  enter the streets alone; but the force with which she expressed it  betrayed a real alarm--an alarm which communicated itself to me. Where  could this unprotected girl be going, alone and in a hotel cab?    \"I could not imagine, and when I saw Madame stop in the middle of her  talk to buy some fresh flowers and pin them to Miss Willetts' corsage, I  got a queer feeling, and flinging my newspaper aside, I strolled to the  door and so out in time to hear Madame's orders to the chauffeur. The  young lady was to be taken to a museum. To a museum, at this early hour!  and alone, alone! Such a proceeding is not at all in accord with French  ideas, and I feared a plot. Though it was far from being my affair, I  determined to make it so; and as soon as I dared, I followed her just as  I had followed her from the dock. But fruitlessly! Not knowing the  danger, how could I avert it? I was in one gallery, she in the other. It  was my evil fate to see her fall, but by whose hand I am as ignorant as  yourselves. _Now_ I have told it all. Will you let me go?\"    \"Not yet,\" interposed the Coroner. \"There are one or two questions more  which you will undoubtedly answer with the same frankness. Were you  standing in front of the pedestal or behind it when you saw Miss Willetts  fall?\"    \"I was standing just where I said, somewhere near it in the open  gallery.\"    This seemed so open to question that the Coroner paused a moment to  recall the exact situation and see if it were possible for a man as  conspicuous in figure as Mr. Travis to have stood thus in full view of  gallery and court, without attracting the attention of anyone in either  place. He found, after a moment's consideration, that it was possible.  Mr. Gryce, for all his efforts and systematic inquiry into the position  which each person had held at or near this time, had been able to find  but one who chanced to be looking in the direction of this gallery, and  he with a limited view which took in only the upper part of the tapestry.    A probe in a fresh direction might reach a more vulnerable spot.    \"But you had been behind the pedestal?\" Dr. Price suggested.    \"Yes\"--the quick flush coming again. \"My old timidity led me to conceal  myself where I could watch undetected her bright young figure pass from  arch to arch along the opposite gallery. Not till she had got past my  line of view did I step out, and then--then it was to see what I have  already told you--her rush toward the front--the start she gave--the  fall--that cruel arrow!

He had spilled the wine in pouring it out. He had started  nervously when spoken to. Mr. Linthorne even thought that he had seen  tears in his eyes. Altogether, he was strangely unlike himself.    Mr. Linthorne had asked him if anything was the matter, but John had,  with almost unnecessary earnestness, declared there was nothing.  Altogether, the squire was puzzled. With any other servant, he would  have thought he had been drinking, but such a supposition, in John's  case, was altogether out of the question.    He could have had no bad news, so far as the squire knew, for the only  children he had, had died young, and he had no near relatives or  connections. It was ridiculous to suppose that John, at his age, had  fallen in love. Altogether, the squire failed to suggest to himself any  explanation of his old butler's conduct, and had just concluded,  philosophically, by the reflection that he supposed he should know what  it was sooner or later, when the door of the room quietly opened.    The squire did not look up. It closed again as quietly, and then he  glanced towards it. He could hardly believe his eyes. A child was  standing there--a girl with soft smooth hair, and large eyes, and a  sensitive mouth, with an expression fearless but appealing. Her hands  were clasped before her, and she was standing in doubt whether to  advance. There was something so strange, in this apparition in the  lonely room, that the squire did not speak for a moment. It flashed  across him, vaguely, that there was something familiar to him in the  face and expression, something which sent a thrill through him; and at  the same instant, without knowing why, he felt that there was a  connection between the appearance of the child, and the matter he had  just been thinking of--John Petersham's strange conduct. He was still  looking at her, when she advanced quietly towards him.    \"Grandpapa,\" she said, \"I am Aggie Linthorne.\"    A low cry of astonishment broke from the squire. He pushed his chair  back.    \"Can it be true?\" he muttered. \"Or am I dreaming?\"    \"Yes, grandpapa,\" the child said, close beside him now. \"I am Aggie  Linthorne, and I have come to see you. If you don't think it's me,  grampa said I was to give you this, and then you would know;\" and she  held out a miniature, on ivory, of a boy some fourteen years old; and a  watch and chain.    \"I do not need them,\" the squire said, in low tones. \"I see it in your  face. You are Herbert's child, whom I looked for so long.    \"Oh! my child! my child! have you come at last?\" and he drew her  towards him, and kissed her passionately, while the tears streamed down  his cheeks.    \"I couldn't come before, you know,\" the child said, \"because I didn't  know about you; and grampa, that's my other grandpapa,\" she nodded  confidentially, \"did not know you wanted me. But now he knows, he sent  me to you. He told me I was to come because you were lonely.    \"But you can't be more lonely than he is,\" she said, with a quiver in  her voice. \"Oh! he will be lonely, now!\"    \"But where do you come from, my dear? and how did you get here? and  what have you been doing, all these years?\"    \"Grampa brought me here,\" the child said. \"I call him grampa, you know,  because I did when I was little, and I have always kept to it; but I  know, of course, it ought to be grandpapa. He brought me here, and  John--at least he called him John--brought me in. And I have been  living, for two years, with Mrs. Walsham down in the town, and I used  to see you in church, but I did not know that you were my grandpapa.\"    The squire, who was holding her close to him while she spoke, got up  and rang the bell; and John opened the door, with a quickness that  showed that he had been waiting close to it, anxiously waiting a  summons.    \"John Petersham,\" the squire said, \"give me your hand. This is the  happiest day of my life.\"    The two men wrung each other's hands. They had been friends ever since  John Petersham, who was twelve years the senior of the two, first came  to the house, a young fellow of eighteen, to assist his father, who had  held the same post before him.    \"God be thanked, squire!\" he said huskily.    \"God be thanked, indeed, John!\" the squire rejoined, reverently. \"So  this was the reason, old friend, why your hand shook as you poured out  my wine. How could you keep the secret from me?\"    \"I did not know how to begin to tell you, but I was pretty nigh letting  it out, and only the thought that it was better the little lady should  tell you herself, as we had agreed, kept it in. Only to think, squire,  after all these years! But I never quite gave her up. I always thought,  somehow, as she would come just like this.\"    \"Did you, John? I gave up hope years ago. How did it come about, John?\"    \"Mrs. Walsham told me, as I came out of church today, as she wanted to  speak to me. So I went down, and she told me all about it, and then I  saw him--\" John hesitated at the name, for he knew that, perhaps, the  only man in the world against whom his master cherished a bitter  resentment, was the father of his son's wife. \"It seems he never saw  your advertisements, never knew as you wanted to hear anything of the  child, so he took her away and kept her. He has been here, off and on,  all these years. I heard tell of him, often and often, when I had been  down into Sidmouth, but never dreamt as it was him. He went about the  country with a box on wheels with glasses--a peep show as they calls  it.\"    The squire winced.    \"He is well spoken of, squire,\" John said, \"and I am bound to say as he  doesn't seem the sort of man we took him for, at all, not by no means.  He did not know you wanted to have her, but he thought it his duty to  give her the chance, and so he put her with Mrs. Walsham, and never  told her, till yesterday, who she was. Mrs. Walsham was quite grieved  at parting with her, for she says she is wonderfully quick at her  lessons, and has been like a daughter with her, for the last two  years.\"    The child had sat quietly down in a chair, and was looking into the  fire while the two men were speaking. She had done what she was told to  do, and was waiting quietly for what was to come next. Her quick ear,  however, caught, in the tones of John Petersham, an apologetic tone  when speaking of her grandfather, and she was moved to instant anger.    \"Why do you speak like that of my grampa?\" she said, rising to her  feet, and standing indignantly before him. \"He is the best man in the  world, and the kindest and the nicest, and if you don't like him, I can  go away to him again. I don't want to stay here, not one minute.    \"You may be my grandpapa,\" she went on, turning to the squire, \"and you  may be lonely, but he is lonely, too, and you have got a great house,  and all sorts of nice things; and you can do better without me than he  can, for he has got nothing to love but me, poor grampa!\"    And her eyes filled with sudden tears, as she thought of him tramping  on his lonely walks over the hills.    \"We do not mean to speak unkindly of your grandfather, my dear,\" the  squire said gently. \"I have never seen him, you know, and John has  never seen him but once. I have thought, all these years, bitterly of  him; but perhaps I have been mistaken. He has ever been kind and good  to you, and, above all, he has given you back to me, and that will make  me think differently of him, in future. We all make mistakes, you know,  and I have made terrible mistakes, and have been terribly punished for  them. I daresay I have made a mistake here; but whether or no, you  shall never hear a word, from me, against the man who has been so kind  to you.\"    \"And you will let me see him sometimes, grandpapa?\" the child said,  taking his hand pleadingly. \"He said, if you said no, I must do as you  told me; because somehow you are nearer to me than he is, though I  don't know how that can be. But you won't say that, will you? For, oh!  I know he is so lonely without me, and I should never be happy,  thinking of him all alone, not if you were to be ever so kind to me,  and to give me all sorts of grand things.\"    \"No, my dear, I certainly shall not say so. You shall see him as often  as you like.\"    \"Oh, thank you, grandpapa!\" she exclaimed joyfully, and she held up her  face to kiss him.    The squire lifted her in his arms, and held her closely to him.    \"John,\" he said, \"you must tell Mrs. Morcombe to get a room ready for  my granddaughter, at once, and you had better bring the tea in here,  and then we will think of other things. I feel quite bewildered, at  present.\"    When John returned with the tea, Aggie was sitting on the squire's  knee. She was perfectly at home, now, and had been chattering to him of  her life with her grandfather, and had just related the incident of her  narrow escape from drowning.    \"Do you hear that, John?\" the squire said. \"She was nearly drowned  here, within sight of our home, and I might never have known anything  about it. It seems that lad of Dr. Walsham's saved her life. He is a  fine lad. He was her champion, you know, in that affair with my nephew.  How strange that the two boys should have quarrelled over my  granddaughter!\"    \"Yes, squire, and young Walsham came well out of it!\" John said  heartily; for to him, only, did the squire mention the circumstances of  the case, and he chuckled now to himself, as he thought that Richard  Horton had made an even greater mistake in that matter than he thought  of, for John detested the boy with all his heart, and had only  abstained from reporting his conduct, to the squire, from fear of  giving his master pain.    The squire's brow clouded a little at the allusion.    \"It will make a difference to him, John,\" he said, \"for, of course, now  my granddaughter will take his place.\"    \"And a good thing, too!\" John said heartily. \"I have never said a word  before, squire, because, as you"]]]
