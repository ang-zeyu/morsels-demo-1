[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#12)"],[1,".  Then the Hunter spoke:    \"Half an hour at the most--\"    \"The safari camp?    \"Yes.\"    They no longer climbed. The flitter was boring forwards on a  projectile flight, into the dark of the night.    \"What're those?\" Vye suddenly leaned forward.    Had some of the stars across the space void broken free from their  fixed orbits? Flecks of light, moving in an arc, headed towards the  speeding flitter.    Hume hit a button. Again they arose in a violent leap above those  wandering lights. But ahead on this new level more such dots flocked,  moving fast to close in on the flyer.    \"A straight ram course,\" Hume muttered, more to himself than Vye.    Again the flyer drove forward in a rising thrust of speed. Then the  smooth purr of the propulsion unit faltered, broke into protesting  coughs. Hume worked over the controls, beads of sweat showing on his  forehead and cheek in the gleam of the cabin light.    \"Deading--deading out!\"    He brought the flitter around in a wide circle, the purr smoothed out  once more in a steady reassuring beat.    \"Out run them!\"    But Vye feared they were back again on the losing side of a struggle  with the unknown alien power. As they had been herded along the river,  so now they were being pushed across the sky, towards the mountains.  The enemy had followed them aloft!    Some core of stubborn will in Hume would not yet allow him to admit  that. Time and time again he climbed higher--always to meet climbing,  twisting, spurting lines of lights which reacted on the engine of the  flitter and threatened it with complete failure.    Where they were now in relation to Wass' camp or that of the safari,  Vye had no idea, and he guessed that Hume could not be too certain.    Hume switched on the flitter's com unit, tried a channel search until  he picked up a click of signal--the automatic reply of the safari  camp. His fingertip beat out in return the danger warning, then the  series of code sounds to give an edited version of what must be  guarded against.    \"Wass has a man in your camp. His skin is in just as much danger as  the rest. He may not relay it to the Patrol, but he'll keep the force  barrier up and the civs inside--anything else would be malicious  neglect and a murder charge when the Guild check tape goes in. This  call is on the spacer tape now and will be a part of that--he can't  possibly alter such a report and he knows it. This is the best we can  do now--\"    \"We're close to the mountains, aren't we?\"    \"Do you know much about this part of the country?\" Vye persisted.  Hume's knowledge might be their only hope.    \"Flew over the range twice. Nothing to see.\"    \"But there has to be something there.\"    \"If there is, it didn't show up during our survey.\" Hume's voice was  dull with fatigue.    \"You're a Guild man, you've dealt with alien life forms before--\"    \"The Guild doesn't deal with intelligent aliens. That's X-Tee Patrol  business. We don't land on any planet with unknown intelligent life  forms. Why should we court trouble--couldn't run a safari in under  those conditions. X-Tee certified Jumala as a wild world, our survey  confirmed that.\"    \"Someone or something landed here after you left?\"    \"I don't believe so. This is too well organized an action. And since  we have a satellite guard in space, any ship landing would be taped  and recorded. No such record appeared on the Guild screens. One small  spacer--such as Wass'--could slip through by knowing procedure--just  as he did. But to land all those beasts and equipment they'd need a  regular transport. No--this must be native.\" Hume leaned forward  again, flipped a switch.    A small red light answered on the central board.    \"Radar warn-off,\" he explained.    So they wouldn't end up smeared against some cliff face anyway. Which  was only small comfort amid terrifying possibilities.    Hume had taken the precaution just in time. The light blinked faster,  and the speed of the flyer was checked as the automatic control  triggered by the warn-off came into command. Hume's hands were still  on the board, but a system of relays put safety devices into action  with a speed past that which a human pilot could initiate.    They were descending and had to accept that, since the warn-off,  operating for the sake of the passengers, had ruled that move best.  The directive would glide the flitter to the best available landing.  It was only moments before the shock gear did touch surface. Then the  engine was silent.    \"This is it,\" Hume observed.    \"What do we do now?\" Vye wanted to know.    \"Wait--\"    \"Wait! For what?\"    Hume consulted his planet-time watch in the light of the cabin.    \"We have about an hour until dawn--if dawn arrives here at the same  time it does in the plains. I don't propose to go out blindly in the  dark.\"    Which made sense. Except that to sit here, quietly, in their cramped  quarters, not knowing what might be waiting outside, was an ordeal Vye  found increasingly harder to bear. Maybe Hume guessed his discomfort,  maybe he was following routine procedure. But he turned, thumbed open  one of the side panels in Vye's compartment, and dug out the emergency  supplies.          9      They sorted the crash rations into small packs. A blanket of the  water-resistant, feather-heavy Ozakian spider silk was cut into a  protective covering for Vye. That piece of tailoring occupied them  until the graying sky permitted them a full picture of the pocket in  which the flitter had landed. The dark foliage of the mountain growth  was broken here by a ledge of dark-blue stone on which the flyer  rested.    To the right was a sheer drop, and a land slip had cut away the ledge  itself a few feet behind the flitter. There was only a steadily  narrowing path ahead, slanting upward.    \"Can we take off again?\" Vye hoped to be reassured that such a feat  was possible.    \"Look up!\"    Vye backed against the cliff wall, stared up at the sky. Well above  them those globes still swam in unwearied circles, commanding the air  lanes.    Hume had cautiously approached the outer rim of the ledge, was using  his distance glasses to scan what might lie below.    \"No sign yet.\"    Vye knew what he meant. The globes were overhead, but the blue beasts,  or any other fauna those balls might summon, had not yet appeared.    Shouldering their packs they started along the ledge. Hume had his ray  tube, but Vye was weaponless, unless somewhere along their route he  could pick up some defensive and offensive arm. Stones had burst the  lights of the islet, they might prove as effective against the blue  beasts. He kept watch for any of the proper size and weight.    The ledge narrowed, one shoulder scraped the cliff now as they  rounded a pinnacle to lose sight of the flitter. But the globes  continued to hover over them.    \"We are still traveling in the direction they want,\" Vye speculated.    Hume had gone to hands and knees to negotiate an ascent so steep he  had to search for head and toe holds. When they were safely past that  point they took a breather, and Vye glanced aloft again. Now the sky  was empty.    \"We may have arrived, or are about to do so,\" said Hume.    \"Where?\"    Hume shrugged. \"Your guess is as good as mine. And both of us can be  wrong.\"    The steep ascent did not quite reach the top of the cliff around the  face of which the ledge curled. Instead their path now leveled off and  began to widen out so that they could walk with more confidence. Then  it threaded into a crevice between two towering rock walls and sloped  downward.    A path unnaturally smooth, Vye thought, as if shaped to funnel  wayfarers on. And they came out on the rim of a valley, a valley  centered with a wood-encircled lake. They stepped from the rock of the  passage onto a springy turf which gave elastically to their tread.    Vye's sandal struck a round stone. It started from its bed in the  black-green vegetation, turned over so that round pits stared  eyelessly up at him. He was faced by the fleshless grin of a human  skull.    Hume went down on one knee, examined the ground growth, gingerly  lifted the lace of vertebrae forming a spine. That ended in a crushed  break which he studied briefly before he laid the bones gently back  into the concealing cover of the mossy stuff.    \"That was done by teeth!\"    The cup of green valley had not changed, it was the same as it had  been when they had emerged from the crevice. But now every clump of  trees, every wind-rippled mound of brush promised cover.    Vye moistened his lips, diverted his eyes from the skull.    \"Weathered,\" Hume said slowly, \"must have been here for seasons, maybe  planet years.\"    \"A survivor from the L-B?\" Yet this spot lay days of travel from that  clearing back in the plains.    \"How did he get here?\"    \"Probably the same way we would have, had we not holed up on that  river island.\"    Driven! Perhaps the lone human on Jumala herded up into this dead-end  valley by the globes or the blue beasts. \"This process must have been  in action for some time.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I can give you two reasons.\" Hume studied the nearest trees narrowly.  \"First--for some purpose, whatever we are up against wants all  interlopers moved out of the lowlands into this section, either to  imprison them, or to keep them under surveillance. Second--\" He  hesitated.    Vye's own imagination supplied a second reason, a revolting one he  tried to deny to himself even as he put it into words:    \"That broken spine--food....\" Vye wanted Hume to contradict him, but  the Hunter only glanced around, his expression already sufficient  answer.    \"Let's get out of here!\" Vye was fighting down panic with every ounce  of control he could summon, trying not to bolt for the crevice. But he  knew he could not force himself any farther into that sinister valley.    \"If we can!\" Hume's words lingered direly in his ears.    Stones had smashed the globes by the river.

Was never sight of pareil fame,        For God before man like Himself did frame,      But God Himself now like a mortal man became.        A Child He was, and had not learnt to speak,      That with His word the world before did make;      His mother's arms Him bore, He was so weak,      That with one hand the vaults of heaven could shake,      See how small room my infant Lord doth take,        Whom all the world is not enough to hold!        Who of His years, or of His age hath told?      Never such age so young, never a child so old.\"{43}    The old lullaby tradition is continued by Wither, though the infant in  the cradle is an ordinary human child, who is rocked to sleep with the  story of his Lord:--       \"A little Infant once was He,          And strength in weakness then was laid      Upon His virgin-mother's knee,          That power to thee might be conveyed.              Sweet baby, then, forbear to weep;              Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.           *       *       *       *       *        Within a manger lodged thy Lord,          Where oxen lay and asses fed;      Warm rooms we do to thee afford,          An easy cradle or a bed.              Sweet baby, then, forbear to weep;              Be still, my babe; sweet baby, sleep.\"{44}    When we come to the eighteenth century we find, where we might least  expect it, among the moral verses of Dr. Watts, a charming cradle-song  conceived in just the same way:-- |84|       \"Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,          Holy angels guard thy bed!      Heavenly blessings without number          Gently falling on thy head.           *       *       *       *       *        Soft and easy is thy cradle;          Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay.      When His birthplace was a stable,          And His softest bed was hay.           *       *       *       *       *        Lo He slumbers in His manger          Where the horned oxen fed;      --Peace, my darling, here's no danger;          Here's no ox a-near thy bed.\"{45}    It is to the eighteenth century that the three most popular of English  Christmas hymns belong. Nahum Tate's \"While shepherds watched their  flocks by night\"--one of the very few hymns (apart from metrical psalms)  in common use in the Anglican Church before the nineteenth century--is a  bald and apparently artless paraphrase of St. Luke which, by some  accident, has attained dignity, and is aided greatly by the simple and  noble tune now attached to it. Charles Wesley's \"Hark, the herald angels  sing,\" or--as it should be--\"Hark, how all the welkin rings,\" is much  admired by some, but to the present writer seems a mere piece of  theological rhetoric. Byrom's \"Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,\"  has the stiffness and formality or its period, but it is not without a  certain quaintness and dignity. One could hardly expect fine Christmas  poetry of an age whose religion was on the one hand staid, rational,  unimaginative, and on the other \"Evangelical\" in the narrow sense,  finding its centre in the Atonement rather than the Incarnation.    The revived mediaevalism, religious and aesthetic, of the nineteenth  century, produced a number of Christmas carols. Some, like Swinburne's  \"Three damsels in the queen's chamber,\" with |85| its exquisite verbal  music and delightful colour, and William Morris's less successful  \"Masters, in this hall,\" and \"Outlanders, whence come ye last?\" are the  work of unbelievers and bear witness only to the aesthetic charm of the  Christmas story; but there are others, mostly from Roman or  Anglo-Catholic sources, of real religious inspiration.[34] The most  spontaneous are Christina Rossetti's, whose haunting rhythms and delicate  feeling are shown at their best in her songs of the Christ Child. More  studied and self-conscious are the austere Christmas verses of Lionel  Johnson and the graceful carols of Professor Selwyn Image. In one poem  Mr. Image strikes a deeper and stronger note than elsewhere; its solemn  music takes us back to an earlier century:--       \"Consider, O my soul, what morn is this!          Whereon the eternal Lord of all things made,      For us, poor mortals, and our endless bliss,          Came down from heaven; and, in a manger laid,          The first, rich, offerings of our ransom paid:      Consider, O my soul, what morn is this!\"{46}    Not a few contemporary poets have given us Christmas carols or poems.  Among the freshest and most natural are those of Katharine Tynan, while  Mr. Gilbert Chesterton has written some Christmas lyrics full of colour  and vitality, and with a true mystical quality. Singing of Christmas, Mr.  Chesterton is at his best; he has instinctive sympathy with the spirit of  the festival, its human kindliness, its democracy, its sacramentalism,  its exaltation of the child:--       \"The thatch of the roof was as golden          Though dusty the straw was and old;      The wind had a peal as of trumpets,          Though blowing and barren and cold. |86|        The mother's hair was a glory,          Though loosened and torn;      For under the eaves in the gloaming          A child was born.\"{47}    Thus opens a fine poem on the Nativity as symbolizing miracle of birth,  of childhood with its infinite possibilities, eternal renewal of faith  and hope.    |87| |88| |89|          CHAPTER IV    CHRISTMAS IN LITURGY AND POPULAR DEVOTION          Advent and Christmas Offices of the Roman Church--The Three Masses of      Christmas, their Origin and their Celebration in Rome--The Midnight      Mass in Many Lands--Protestant Survivals of the Night      Services--Christmas in the Greek Church--The Eastern Epiphany and the      Blessing of the Waters--The _Presepio_ or Crib, its Supposed      Institution by St. Francis--Early Traces of the Crib--The Crib in      Germany, Tyrol, &c.--Cradle-rocking in Mediaeval Germany--Christmas      Minstrels in Italy and Sicily--The _Presepio_ in Italy--Ceremonies      with the _Culla_ and the _Bambino_ in Rome--Christmas in Italian      London--The Spanish Christmas--Possible Survivals of the Crib in      England.    [Illustration:    THE NATIVITY.    From Add. MS. 32454 in the British Museum    (French, 15th century).]    From a study of Christmas as reflected in lyric poetry, we now pass to  other forms of devotion in which the Church has welcomed the Redeemer at  His birth. These are of two kinds--liturgical and popular; and they  correspond in a large degree to the successive ways of apprehending the  meaning of Christmas which we traced in the foregoing chapters. Strictly  liturgical devotions are little understanded of the people: only the  clergy can fully join in them; for the mass of the lay folk they are  mysterious rites in an unknown tongue, to be followed with reverence, as  far as may be, but remote and little penetrated with humanity. Side by  side with these, however, are popular devotions, full of vivid colour,  highly anthropomorphic, bringing the mysteries of religion within the  reach of the simplest minds, and warm with human feeling. The austere  Latin hymns of the earlier centuries belong to liturgy; the vernacular  Christmas poetry of later ages is largely associated with popular  devotion.    |90| Liturgiology is a vast and complicated, and except to the few, an  unattractive, subject. To attempt here a survey of the liturgies in their  relation to Christmas is obviously impossible; we must be content to  dwell mainly upon the present-day Roman offices, which, in spite of  various revisions, give some idea of the mediaeval services of Latin  Christianity, and to cast a few glances at other western rites, and at  those of the Greek Church.    Whatever may be his attitude towards Catholicism, or, indeed,  Christianity, no one sensitive to the music of words, or the suggestions  of poetic imagery, can read the Roman Breviary and Missal without  profound admiration for the amazing skill with which the noblest passages  of Hebrew poetry are chosen and fitted to the expression of Christian  devotion, and the gold of psalmists, prophets, and apostles is welded  into coronals for the Lord and His saints. The office-books of the Roman  Church are, in one aspect, the greatest of anthologies.    Few parts of the Roman Breviary have more beauty than the Advent[35]  offices, where the Church has brought together the majestic imagery of  the Hebrew prophets, the fervent exhortation of the apostles, to prepare  the minds of the faithful for the coming of the Christ, for the  celebration of the Nativity.    Advent begins with a stirring call. If we turn to the opening service of  the Christian Year, the First Vespers of the First Sunday in Advent, we  shall find as the first words in the \"Proper of the Season\" the  trumpet-notes of St. Paul: \"Brethren, it is high time to awake out of  sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.\" This, the  Little Chapter for the office, is followed by the ancient hymn, \"Creator  alme siderum,\"{1} chanting in awful tones the two comings of |91|  Christ, for redemption and for judgment; and then are sung the words that  strike the keynote of the Advent services, and are heard again and again.       \"_Rorate, coeli, desuper, et nubes pluant Justum_      (Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down the            Righteous One).      _Aperiatur terra et germinet Salvatorem_      (Let the earth open, and let her bring forth the Saviour).\"    _Rorate, coeli, desuper_--Advent is a time of longing expectancy. It is a  season of waiting patiently for the Lord, whose coming in great humility  is to be commemorated at Christmas, to whose coming again in His glorious  majesty to judge both the quick and the dead"]]]
