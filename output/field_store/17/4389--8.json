Wood [land] for  pannage [foraging by pigs] 1 league in length and half a league  in breadth. In King Edward's time it was worth 9 pounds; now [it  is worth] 6 pounds.\"    Ilbert de Laci has now this land, where he has twelve ploughs in  the demesne; and forty-eight villani, and twelve bordars with  fifteen ploughs, and three churches and three priests, and three  mills of ten shillings. Wood pastures two miles long, and one  broad. The whole manor five miles long and two broad. Value in  King Edward's time sixteen pounds, the same now.    That manor of the town of Coventry which was individually held  was that of the Countess of Coventry, who was the wife of the  earl of Mercia. \"The Countess held in Coventry. There are 5  hides. The arable land employs 20 ploughs. In the demesne lands  there are 3 ploughs and 7 ploughs. In the demesne lands there are  3 ploughs and 7 bondmen. There are 50 villeins and 12 bordars  with 20 ploughs. The mill there pay[s] 3 shillings. The  woodlands are 2 miles long and the same broad. In King Edward's  time and afterwards, it was worth 22 pounds [440 s.], now only  11 pounds by weight. These lands of the Countess Godiva Nicholas  holds to farm of the King.\"    The survey shows a few manors and monasteries owned a salt-house  or salt-pit in the local saltworks, from which they were  entitled to obtain salt.    This survey resulted in the first national tax system of about  6s. per hide of land.    The survey also provided William with a summary of customs of  areas. For instance, in Oxfordshire, \"Anyone breaking the King's  peace given under his hand and seal to the extent of committing  homicide shall be at the King's mercy in respect of his life and  members. That is if he be captured. And if he cannot be  captured, he shall be considered as an outlaw, and anyone who  kills him shall have all his possessions. The King shall take  the possessions of any stranger who has elected to live in  Oxford and who dies in possession of a house in that town, and  without any kinfolk. The King shall be entitled to the body and  the possessions of any man who kills another within his own  court or house excepting always the dower of his wife, if he has  a wife who has received dower.    The courts of the King and barons became schools of chivalry  wherein seven year old noble boys became as pages or valets,  wore a dagger and waited upon the ladies of the household. At  age fourteen, they were advanced to squires and admitted into  more familiar association with the knights and ladies of the  court. They perfected their skills in dancing, riding, fencing,  hawking, hunting and jousting. Before knighthood, they played  team sports in which one team tried to put the other team to  rout. A knight usually selected a wife from the court at which  he grew up.    These incidents of land tenure began (but were not firmly  established until the reign of Henry II). Each tenant, whether  baron or subtenant, had to pay an \"aid\" in money for ransom if  his lord was captured in war, for the knighthood of his lord's  eldest son, and for the marriage of his lord's eldest daughter.  Land could be held by an heir only if he could fight. The eldest  son began to succeed to the whole of the lands in all military  tenures. An heir of a tenant had to pay a heavy \"relief\" on  succession to his estate. If there was a delay in proving  heirship or paying relief, the lord would hold the land and  receive its income in the meantime, often a year. If an heir was  still a minor or female, he or she passed into his lord's  wardship, in which the lord had guardianship of the heir and  possession of the estate, with all its profits. A female heir was  expected to marry a man acceptable to the lord. The estate of an  heiress and her land was generally sold to the highest bidder.  If there were no heirs, the land escheated to the lord. If a  tenant committed felony, his land escheated to his lord.    Astrologers resided with the families of the barons. People went  to fortune tellers' shops. There was horse racing, steeple  races, and chess for recreation. Girls had dolls; boys had toy  soldiers, spinning tops, toy horses, ships, and wooden models.    The state of medicine is indicated by this medical advice brought  to the nation by William's son after treatment on the continent:      \"If thou would have health and vigor Shun cares and avoid anger.  Be temperate in eating And in the use of wine. After a heavy meal  Rise and take the air Sleep not with an overloaded stomach And  above all thou must Respond to Nature when she calls.\"    Many free sokemen were caught up in the subjugation by baron  landlords and were reduced almost to the condition of the unfree  villein. The services they performed for their lords were often  indistinguishable. They might also hold their land by villein  tenure, although free as a person with the legal rights of a  free man. The free man still had a place in court proceedings  which the unfree villein did not.    William allowed Jewish traders to follow him from Normandy and  settle in separate sections of the main towns. They loaned money  for the building of castles and cathedrals. Christians were not  allowed by the church to engage in this usury. The Jews could  not become citizens nor could they have standing in the local  courts. Instead, a royal justiciar secured justice for them. The  Jews could practice their own religion. Only Jews could wear  yellow.    William was succeeded as King by his son William II, who imposed  on many of the customs of the nation to get more money for  himself.      The Law    The Norman conquerors brought no written law, but affirmed the  laws of the nation. Two they especially enforced were:    Anyone caught in the act of digging up the King's road, felling a  tree across it, or attacking someone so that his blood spilled  on it shall pay a fine to the King.    All freemen shall have a surety who would hand him over to  justice for his offenses or pay the damages or fines due. Also,  the entire hundred was the ultimate surety for murder and would  have to pay a \"murdrum\" fine.    William made these decrees:    No cattle shall be sold except in towns and before three  witnesses.    For the sale of ancient chattels, there must be a surety and a  warrantor.    No man shall be sold over the sea. (This ended the slave trade at  the port of Bristol.)    The death penalty for persons tried by court is abolished.      Judicial Procedure    \"Ecclesiastical\" courts were created for bishops to preside over  issues concerning the cure of souls and criminal cases in which  the ordeal was used. When William did not preside over this  court, an appeal could be made to him.    The hundred and shire courts now sat without a bishop and handled  only \"civil\" cases. They were conducted by the King's own  appointed sheriff. Only freemen and not bound villeins had  standing in this court.    William held court or sent the justiciar or commissioners to hold  his Royal Court [Curia Regis] in the various districts. The  commissioner appointed groups of local men to give a collective  verdict upon oath for each trial he conducted. A person could  spend months trying to catch up with the Royal Court to present a  case.    William allowed, on an ad hoc basis, certain high-level people  such as bishops and abbots and those who made a large payment,  to have land disputes decided by an inquiry of recognitors.    A dispute between a Norman and an English man over land or a  criminal act could be decided by trial by battle. Each combatant  first swore to the truth of his cause and undertook to prove by  his body the truth of his cause by making the other surrender by  crying \"craven\" [craving forgiveness]. The combatants used  weapons like pick-axes and shields. Presumably the man in the  wrong would not fight as well because he was burdened with a  guilty conscience. Although this trial was thought to reflect  God's will, it favored the physically fit and adept person.    London had its own traditions. All London citizens met at its  folkmoot, which was held three times a year to determine its  public officers, to raise matters of public concern, and to make  ordinances. It's criminal court had the power of outlawry as did  the shire courts. Trade, land, and other civil issues were dealt  with by the Hustings Court, which met every Monday in the  Guildhall. The city was divided into wards, each of which was  under the charge of an elected alderman [elder man]. (This was  not a popular election.) The aldermen had special knowledge of  the law and a duty to declare it at the Hustings Court. Each  alderman also conducted wardmoots in his ward and decided  criminal and civil issues between its residents. Within the  wards were the guilds of the city.    William made the hundred responsible for paying a murder fine for  the murder of any of his men, if the murderer was not  apprehended by his lord within a few days. The reaction to this  was that the murderer mutilated the corpse to make identification  of nationality impossible. So William ordered  that every murder victim was assumed to be Norman unless proven  English. This began a court custom in murder cases of first  proving the victim to be English.    The Royal Court decided this case: \"At length both parties were  summoned before the King's court, in which there sat many of the  nobles of the land of whom Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, was  delegated by the King's authority as judge of the dispute, with  Ranulf the Vicomte, Neel, son of Neel, Robert de Usepont, and  many other capable judges who diligently and fully examined the  origin of the dispute, and delivered judgment that the mill  ought to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16940"],[0,"Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh (#12)"],[1,"His truth.  Nay, all created things would be so dazzled and thunderstruck by the  evidences of His light as to be reduced to utter nothingness. How, then,  can the godly be differentiated under such circumstances from the froward?    This principle hath operated in each of the previous Dispensations and  been abundantly demonstrated.... It is for this reason that, in every age,  when a new Manifestation hath appeared and a fresh revelation of God's  transcendent power was vouchsafed unto men, they that misbelieved in Him,  deluded by the appearance of the peerless and everlasting Beauty in the  garb of mortal men, have failed to recognize Him. They have erred from His  path and eschewed His company--the company of Him Who is the Symbol of  nearness to God. They have even arisen to decimate the ranks of the  faithful and to exterminate such as believed in Him.    Behold how in this Dispensation the worthless and foolish have fondly  imagined that by such instruments as massacre, plunder and banishment they  can extinguish the Lamp which the Hand of Divine power hath lit, or  eclipse the Day Star of everlasting splendor. How utterly unaware they  seem to be of the truth that such adversity is the oil that feedeth the  flame of this Lamp! Such is God's transforming power. He changeth  whatsoever He willeth; He verily hath power over all things....    Consider at all times the sovereignty exercised by the Ideal King, and  behold the evidences of His power and paramount influence. Sanctify your  ears from the idle talk of them that are the symbols of denial and the  exponents of violence and anger. The hour is approaching when ye will  witness the power of the one true God triumphing over all created things  and the signs of His sovereignty encompassing all creation. On that day ye  will discover how all else besides Him will have been forgotten and come  to be regarded as utter nothingness.    It should, however, be borne in mind that God and His Manifestation can,  under no circumstances, be dissociated from the loftiness and sublimity  which They inherently possess. Nay, loftiness and sublimity are themselves  the creations of His Word, if ye choose to see with My sight not with  yours.            XXX: GOD WITNESSETH THAT THERE IS NO GOD BUT...      God witnesseth that there is no God but Him, the Gracious, the  Best-Beloved. All grace and bounty are His. To whomsoever He will He  giveth whatsoever is His wish. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the  Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. We, verily, believe in  Him Who, in the person of the Bab, hath been sent down by the Will of the  one true God, the King of Kings, the All-Praised. We, moreover, swear  fealty to the One Who, in the time of Musta_gh_a_th_, is destined to be  made manifest, as well as to those Who shall come after Him till the end  that hath no end. We recognize in the manifestation of each one of them,  whether outwardly or inwardly, the manifestation of none but God Himself,  if ye be of those that comprehend. Every one of them is a mirror of God,  reflecting naught else but His Self, His Beauty, His Might and Glory, if  ye will understand. All else besides them are to be regarded as mirrors  capable of reflecting the glory of these Manifestations Who are themselves  the Primary Mirrors of the Divine Being, if ye be not devoid of  understanding. No one hath ever escaped them, neither are they to be  hindered from achieving their purpose. These Mirrors will everlastingly  succeed each other, and will continue to reflect the light of the Ancient  of Days. They that reflect their glory will, in like manner, continue to  exist for evermore, for the Grace of God can never cease from flowing.  This is a truth that none can disprove.            XXXI: CONTEMPLATE WITH THINE INWARD EYE THE...      Contemplate with thine inward eye the chain of successive Revelations that  hath linked the Manifestation of Adam with that of the Bab. I testify  before God that each one of these Manifestations hath been sent down  through the operation of the Divine Will and Purpose, that each hath been  the bearer of a specific Message, that each hath been entrusted with a  divinely-revealed Book and been commissioned to unravel the mysteries of a  mighty Tablet. The measure of the Revelation with which every one of them  hath been identified had been definitely fore-ordained. This, verily, is a  token of Our favor unto them, if ye be of those that comprehend this  truth.... And when this process of progressive Revelation culminated in  the stage at which His peerless, His most sacred, and exalted Countenance  was to be unveiled to men's eyes, He chose to hide His own Self behind a  thousand veils, lest profane and mortal eyes discover His glory. This He  did at a time when the signs and tokens of a divinely-appointed Revelation  were being showered upon Him--signs and tokens which none can reckon except  the Lord, your God, the Lord of all worlds. And when the set time of  concealment was fulfilled, We sent forth, whilst still wrapt within a  myriad veils, an infinitesimal glimmer of the effulgent Glory enveloping  the Face of the Youth, and lo, the entire company of the dwellers of the  Realms above were seized with violent commotion and the favored of God  fell down in adoration before Him. He hath, verily, manifested a glory  such as none in the whole creation hath witnessed, inasmuch as He hath  arisen to proclaim in person His Cause unto all who are in the heavens and  all who are on the earth.            XXXII: THAT WHICH THOU HAST HEARD CONCERNING...      That which thou hast heard concerning Abraham, the Friend of the  All-Merciful, is the truth, and no doubt is there about it. The Voice of  God commanded Him to offer up Ishmael as a sacrifice, so that His  steadfastness in the Faith of God and His detachment from all else but Him  may be demonstrated unto men. The purpose of God, moreover, was to  sacrifice him as a ransom for the sins and iniquities of all the peoples  of the earth. This same honor, Jesus, the Son of Mary, besought the one  true God, exalted be His name and glory, to confer upon Him. For the same  reason was Husayn offered up as a sacrifice by Muhammad, the Apostle of  God.    No man can ever claim to have comprehended the nature of the hidden and  manifold grace of God; none can fathom His all-embracing mercy. Such hath  been the perversity of men and their transgressions, so grievous have been  the trials that have afflicted the Prophets of God and their chosen ones,  that all mankind deserveth to be tormented and to perish. God's hidden and  most loving providence, however, hath, through both visible and invisible  agencies, protected and will continue to protect it from the penalty of  its wickedness. Ponder this in thine heart, that the truth may be revealed  unto thee, and be thou steadfast in His path.            XXXIII: IT HATH BEEN DECREED BY US THAT THE WORD...      It hath been decreed by Us that the Word of God and all the potentialities  thereof shall be manifested unto men in strict conformity with such  conditions as have been foreordained by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise. We have, moreover, ordained that its veil of concealment be none  other except its own Self. Such indeed is Our Power to achieve Our  Purpose. Should the Word be allowed to release suddenly all the energies  latent within it, no man could sustain the weight of so mighty a  Revelation. Nay, all that is in heaven and on earth would flee in  consternation before it.    Consider that which hath been sent down unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God.  The measure of the Revelation of which He was the bearer had been clearly  foreordained by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. They that heard  Him, however, could apprehend His purpose only to the extent of their  station and spiritual capacity. He, in like manner, uncovered the Face of  Wisdom in proportion to their ability to sustain the burden of His  Message. No sooner had mankind attained the stage of maturity, than the  Word revealed to men's eyes the latent energies with which it had been  endowed--energies which manifested themselves in the plenitude of their  glory when the Ancient Beauty appeared, in the year sixty, in the person  of 'Ali-Muhammad, the Bab.            XXXIV: ALL PRAISE AND GLORY BE TO GOD WHO,...      All praise and glory be to God Who, through the power of His might, hath  delivered His creation from the nakedness of non-existence, and clothed it  with the mantle of life. From among all created things He hath singled out  for His special favor the pure, the gem-like reality of man, and invested  it with a unique capacity of knowing Him and of reflecting the greatness  of His glory. This twofold distinction conferred upon him hath cleansed  away from his heart the rust of every vain desire, and made him worthy of  the vesture with which his Creator hath deigned to clothe him. It hath  served to rescue his soul from the wretchedness of ignorance.    This robe with which the body and soul of man hath been adorned is the  very foundation of his well-being and development. Oh, how blessed the day  when, aided by the grace and might of the one true God, man will have  freed himself from the bondage and corruption of the world and all that is  therein, and will have attained unto true and abiding rest beneath the  shadow of the Tree of Knowledge!    The songs which the bird of thine heart had uttered in its great love for  its friends have reached their ears, and moved Me to answer thy questions,  and reveal to thee such secrets as I am allowed to unfold. In thine  esteemed letter thou hadst inquired which of the Prophets of God should be  regarded as superior to others. Know thou assuredly that the essence of  all the Prophets of God is one and the same. Their unity is absolute. God,  the Creator, saith: There is no distinction whatsoever among the Bearers  of My"]]]
