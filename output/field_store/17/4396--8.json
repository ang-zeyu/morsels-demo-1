SIR HENRY IRVING    [On November 24, 1883, Henry Irving closed his first engagement in New  York.  William Winter's review appeared next morning in the _Tribune_,  It is reprinted in his book, \"Henry Irving,\" published by G. J.  Coombes, New York, 1889.  Mr. Winter said:  \"Mr. Irving has  impersonated here nine different men, each one distinct from all the  others.  Yet in so doing he has never ceased to exert one and the same  personal charm, the charm of genialised intellect.  The soul that is  within the man has suffused his art and made it victorious.  The same  forms of expression, lacking this spirit, would have lacked the  triumph.  All of them, indeed, are not equally fine.  Mr. Irving's  'Mathias' and 'Louis XI,' are higher performances than his 'Shylock'  and 'Dorincourt,' higher in imaginative tone and in adequacy of  feeling and treatment.  But, throughout all these forms, the drift of  his spirit, setting boldly away from conventions and formalities, has  been manifested with delightful results.  He has always seemed to be  alive with the specific vitality of the person represented.  He has  never seemed a wooden puppet of the stage, bound in by formality and  straining after a vague scholastic ideal of technical correctness.\"    Mr. Irving's addresses, \"The Drama,\" copyright by the United States  Book Company, New York, were published in 1892.  They furnish the  pages now presented,--abounding on self-revelation,--ED.)        THE STAGE AS AN INSTRUCTOR    To boast of being able to appreciate Shakespeare more in reading him  than in seeing him acted used to be a common method of affecting  special intellectuality.  I hope this delusion--a gross and pitiful  one to most of us--has almost absolutely died out.  It certainly  conferred a very cheap badge of superiority on those who entertained  it.  It seemed to each of them an inexpensive opportunity of  worshipping himself on a pedestal.  But what did it amount to?  It was  little more than a conceited and feather-headed assumption that an  unprepared reader, whose mind is usually full of far other things,  will see on the instant all that has been developed in hundreds of  years by the members of a studious and enthusiastic profession.  My  own conviction is that there are few characters or passages of our  great dramatists which will not repay original study.  But at least we  must recognise the vast advantages with which a practised actor,  impregnated by the associations of his life, and by study--with all  the practical and critical skill of his profession up to the date at  which he appears, whether he adopts or rejects tradition--addresses  himself to the interpretation of any great character, even if he have  no originality whatever.  There is something still more than this,  however, in acting.  Every one who has the smallest histrionic gift  has a natural dramatic fertility; so that as soon as he knows the  author's text, and obtains self-possession, and feels at home in a  part without being too familiar with it, the mere automatic action of  rehearsing and playing it at once begins to place the author in new  lights, and to give the personage being played an individuality partly  independent of, and yet consistent with, and rendering more powerfully  visible, the dramatist's conception.  It is the vast power a good  actor has in this way which has led the French to speak of creating a  part when they mean its first being played, and French authors are as  conscious of the extent and value of this cooperation of actors with  them, that they have never objected to the phrase, but, on the  contrary, are uniformly lavish in their homage to the artists who have  created on the boards the parts which they themselves have created on  paper.        INSPIRATION IN ACTING    It is often supposed that great actors trust to the inspiration of the  moment.  Nothing can be more erroneous.  There will, of course, be  such moments, when an actor at a white heat illumines some passage  with a flash of imagination (and this mental condition, by the way, is  impossible to the student sitting in his armchair); but the great  actor's surprises are generally well weighed, studied, and balanced.  We know that Edmund Kean constantly practised before a mirror effects  which startled his audience by their apparent spontaneity.  It is the  accumulation of such effects which enables an actor, after many years,  to present many great characters with remarkable completeness.    I do not want to overstate the case, or to appeal to anything that is  not within common experience, so I can confidently ask you whether a  scene in a great play has not been at some time vividly impressed on  your minds by the delivery of a single line, or even of one forcible  word.  Has not this made the passage far more real and human to you  than all the thought you have devoted to it?  An accomplished critic  has said that Shakespeare himself might have been surprised had he  heard the \"Fool, fool, fool!\" of Edmund Kean.  And though all actors  are not Keans, they have in varying degree this power of making a  dramatic character step out of the page, and come nearer to our hearts  and our understandings.    After all, the best and most convincing exposition of the whole art of  acting is given by Shakespeare himself:  \"To hold, as 'twere, the  mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own  image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.\"  Thus the poet recognised the actor's art as a most potent ally in the  representations of human life.  He believed that to hold the mirror up  to nature was one of the worthiest functions in the sphere of labour,  and actors are content to point to his definition of their work as the  charter of their privileges.        ACTING AS AN ART.  HOW IRVING BEGAN    The practice of the art of acting is a subject difficult to treat with  the necessary brevity.  Beginners are naturally anxious to know what  course they should pursue.  In common with other actors, I receive  letters from young people many of whom are very earnest in their  ambition to adopt the dramatic calling, but not sufficiently alive to  the fact that success does not depend on a few lessons in declamation.  When I was a boy I had a habit which I think would be useful to all  young students.  Before going to see a play of Shakespeare's I used to  form--in a very juvenile way--a theory as to the working out of the  whole drama, so as to correct my conceptions by those of the actors;  and though I was, as a rule, absurdly wrong, there can be no doubt  that any method of independent study is of enormous importance, not  only to youngsters, but also to students of a larger growth.  Without  it the mind is apt to take its stamp from the first forcible  impression it receives, and to fall into a servile dependence upon  traditions, which, robbed of the spirit that created them, are apt to  be purely mischievous.  What was natural to the creator is often  unnatural and lifeless in the imitator.  No two people form the same  conceptions of character, and therefore it is always advantageous to  see an independent and courageous exposition of an original ideal.  There can be no objection to the kind of training that imparts a  knowledge of manners and customs, and the teaching which pertains to  simple deportment on the stage is necessary and most useful; but you  cannot possibly be taught any tradition of character, for that has no  permanence.  Nothing is more fleeting than any traditional method or  impersonation.  You may learn where a particular personage used to  stand on the stage, or down which trap the ghost of Hamlet's father  vanished; but the soul of interpretation is lost, and it is this soul  which the actor has to re-create for himself.  It is not mere attitude  or tone that has to be studied; you must be moved by the impulse of  being; you must impersonate and not recite.        FEELING AS A REALITY OR A SEMBLANCE    It is necessary to warn you against the theory expounded with  brilliant ingenuity by Diderot that the actor never feels.  When  Macready played Virginius, after burying his beloved daughter, he  confessed that his real experience gave a new force to his acting in  the most pathetic situations of the play.  Are we to suppose that this  was a delusion, or that the sensibility of the man was a genuine aid  to the actor?  Bannister said of John Kemble that he was never  pathetic because he had no children.  Talma says that when deeply  moved he found himself making a rapid and fugitive observation on the  alternation of his voice, and on a certain spasmodic vibration which  it contracted in tears.  Has not the actor who can thus make his  feelings a part of his art an advantage over the actor who never  feels, but who makes his observations solely from the feelings of  others?  It is necessary to this art that the mind should have, as it  were, a double consciousness, in which all the emotions proper to the  occasion may have full swing, while the actor is all the time on the  alert for every detail of his method.  It may be that his playing will  be more spirited one night than another.  But the actor who combines  the electric force of a strong personality with a mastery of the  resources of his art must have a greater power over his audiences than  the passionless actor who gives a most artistic simulation of the  emotions he never experiences.        GESTURE.  LISTENING AS AN ART.  TEAM-PLAY ON THE STAGE    With regard to gesture, Shakespeare's advice is all-embracing.  \"Suit  the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special  observance that you overstep not the modesty of nature.\"  And here  comes the consideration of a very material part of the actor's  business--by-play.  This is of the very essence of true art.  It is  more than anything else significant of the extent to which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#12)"],[1,"eats no  flesh--small bananas are his dainties, but not maize. His food consists  of wild fruits, which abound: one, Stafene, or Manyuema Mamwa, is like  large sweet sop but indifferent in taste and flesh. The soko brings  forth at times twins. A very large soko was seen by Mohamad's hunters  sitting picking his nails; they tried to stalk him, but he vanished.  Some Manyuema think that their buried dead rise as sokos, and one was  killed with holes in his ears, as if he had been a man. He is very  strong and fears guns but not spears: he never catches women.    Sokos collect together, and make a drumming noise, some say with hollow  trees, then burst forth into loud yells which are well imitated by the  natives' embryotic music. If a man has no spear the soko goes away  satisfied, but if wounded he seizes the wrist, lops off the fingers, and  spits them out, slaps the cheeks of his victim, and bites without  breaking the skin: he draws out a spear (but never uses it), and takes  some leaves and stuffs them into his wound to staunch the blood; he does  not wish an encounter with an armed man. He sees women do him no harm,  and never molests them; a man without a spear is nearly safe from him.  They beat hollow trees as drums with hands, and then scream as music to  it; when men hear them, they go to the sokos; but sokos never go to men  with hostility. Manyuema say, \"Soko is a man, and nothing bad in him.\"    They live in communities of about ten, each having his own female; an  intruder from another camp is beaten off with their fists and loud  yells. If one tries to seize the female of another, he is caught on the  ground, and all unite in boxing and biting the offender. A male often  carries a child, especially if they are passing from one patch of forest  to another over a grassy space; he then gives it to the mother.    I now spoke with my friend Mohamad, and he offered to go with me to see  Lualaba from Luamo, but I explained that merely to see and measure its  depth would not do, I must see whither it went. This would require a  number of his people in lieu of my deserters, and to take them away from  his ivory trade, which at present is like gold digging, I must make  amends, and I offered him 2000 rupees, and a gun worth 700 rupees, R.  2700 in all, or 270_l._ He agreed, and should he enable me to finish up  my work in one trip down Lualaba, and round to Lualaba West, it would be  a great favour.    [How severely he felt the effects of the terrible illnesses of the last  two years may be imagined by some few words here, and it must ever be  regretted that the conviction which he speaks of was not acted up to.]    The severe pneumonia in Marunga, the choleraic complaint in Manyuema,  and now irritable ulcers warn me to retire while life lasts. Mohamad's  people went north, and east, and west, from Kasonga's: sixteen marches  north, ten ditto west, and four ditto E. and S.E. The average march was  6-1/2 hours, say 12' about 200' N. and W., lat. of Kasongo, say 4 deg.  south. They may have reached 1 deg., 2 deg. S. They were now in the Balegge  country, and turned. It was all dense forest, they never saw the sun  except when at a village, and then the villages were too far apart. The  people were very fond of sheep, which they call ngombe, or ox, and tusks  are never used. They went off to where an elephant had formerly been  killed, and brought the tusks rotted and eaten or gnawed by \"Dere\" (?)--a  Rodent, probably the _Aulocaudatus Swindermanus_. Three large rivers  were crossed, breast and chin deep; in one they were five hours, and a  man in a small canoe went ahead sounding for water capable of being  waded. Much water and mud in the forest. This report makes me thankful I  did not go, for I should have seen nothing, and been worn out by fatigue  and mud. They tell me that the River Metunda had black water, and took  two hours to cross it, breast deep. They crossed about forty smaller  rivers over the River Mohunga, breast deep. The River of Mbite also is  large. All along Lualaba and Metumbe the sheep have hairy dew-laps, no  wool, Tartar breed (?), small thin tails.    A broad belt of meadow-land, with no trees, lies along Lualaba, beyond  that it is all dense forest, and trees so large, that one lying across  the path is breast high: clearances exist only around the villages. The  people are very expert smiths and weavers of the \"Lamba,\" and make fine  large spears, knives, and needles. Market-places, called \"Tokos,\" are  numerous all along Lualaba; to these the Barua of the other bank come  daily in large canoes, bringing grass-cloth, salt, flour, cassava,  fowls, goats, pigs, and slaves. The women are beautiful, with straight  noses, and well-clothed; when the men of the districts are at war, the  women take their goods to market as if at peace and are never molested:  all are very keen traders, buying one thing with another, and changing  back again, and any profit made is one of the enjoyments of life.    I knew that my deserters hoped to be fed by Mohamad Bogharib when we  left the camp at Mamohela, but he told them that he would not have them;  this took them aback, but they went and lifted his ivory for him, and  when a parley was thus brought about, talked him over, saying that they  would go to me, and do all I desired: they never came, but, as no one  else would take them, I gave them three loads to go to Bambarre; there  they told Mohamad that I would not give them beads, and they did not  like to steal; they were now trying to get his food by lies. I invited  them three times to come and take beads, but having supplies of food  from the camp women, they hoped to get the upper hand with me, and take  what they liked by refusing to carry or work. Mohamad spoke long to  them, but speaking mildly makes them imagine that the spokesman is  afraid of them. They kept away from my work and would fain join  Mohamad's, but he won't have them. I gave beads to all but the  ringleaders. Their conduct looks as if a quarrel had taken place between  us, but no such excuse have they.    I am powerless, as they have left me, and think that they may do as they  like, and the \"Manyuema are bad\" is the song. Their badness consists in  being dreadfully afraid of guns, and the Arabs can do just as they like  with them and their goods. If spears alone were used the Manyuema would  be considered brave, for they fear no one, though he has many spears.  They tell us truly \"that were it not for our guns not one of us would  return to our own country.\" Moene-mokaia killed two Arab agents, and took  their guns; this success led to their asserting, in answer to the  remonstrances of the women, \"We shall take their goats, guns, and women  from them.\" The chief, in reporting the matter to Moenemger(?) at Luamo,  said, \"The Englishman told my people to go away as he did not like  fighting, but my men were filled with 'malofu,' or palm-toddy, and  refused to their own hurt.\" Elsewhere they made regular preparation to  have a fight with Dugumbe's people, just to see who was strongest--they  with their spears and wooden shields, and the Arabs with what in  derision they called tobacco-pipes (guns). They killed eight or nine  Arabs.    No traders seem ever to have come in before this. Banna brought copper  and skins for tusks, and the Babisa and Baguha coarse beads. The Bavira  are now enraged at seeing Ujijians pass into their ivory field, and no  wonder; they took the tusks which cost them a few strings of beads, and  received weight for weight in beads, thick brass wire, and loads of  calico.

He was evidently a man of  transcendent genius, and we learn from the speech of St. Stephen that  \"he was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in  words and in deeds.\" His deeds must have been well known in Egypt, for  \"he supposed that his brethren would have understood how that God by His  hand would deliver them, but they understood not.\" His supposition could  not be founded on his success in smiting a single Egyptian; he was too  great a man to be elated by a single act of prowess, but his success on  a large scale in Ethiopia afforded reasonable grounds for believing that  his brethren would be proud of their countryman, and disposed to follow  his leadership, but they were slaves. The notice taken of the matter by  Pharaoh showed that he was eyed by the great as a dangerous, if not  powerful, man. He \"dwelt\" in Midian for some time before his gallant  bearing towards the shepherds by the well, commended him to the priest  or prince of the country.
