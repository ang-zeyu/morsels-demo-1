And ofttimes so  greatly is he comforted by the desire for tribulation and  adversity, through love of conformity to the Cross of Christ,  that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation; for he  believeth that he shall be the more acceptable to God, the more  and the heavier burdens he is able to bear for His sake.  This is  not the virtue of man, but the grace of Christ which hath such  power and energy in the weak flesh, that what it naturally hateth  and fleeth from, this it draweth to and loveth through fervour of  spirit.    9. It is not in the nature of man to bear the cross, to love the  cross, to keep under the body and to bring it into subjection, to  fly from honours, to bear reproaches meekly, to despise self and  desire to be despised, to bear all adversities and losses, and to  desire no prosperity in this world.  If thou lookest to thyself,  thou wilt of thyself be able to do none of this; but if thou  trustest in the Lord, endurance shall be given thee from heaven,  and the world and the flesh shall be made subject to thy command.  Yea, thou shalt not even fear thine adversary the devil, if thou  be armed with faith and signed with the Cross of Christ.    10. Set thyself, therefore, like a good and faithful servant of  Christ, to the manful bearing of the Cross of thy Lord, who out  of love was crucified for thee.  Prepare thyself for the bearing  many adversities and manifold troubles in this wretched life;  because so it shall be with thee wheresoever thou art, and so in  very deed thou shalt find it, wherever thou hide thyself.  This  it must be; and there is no means of escaping from tribulation  and sorrow, except to bear them patiently.  Drink thou lovingly  thy Lord's cup if thou desirest to be His friend and to have thy  lot with Him.  Leave consolations to God, let Him do as seemeth  best to Him concerning them.  But do thou set thyself to endure  tribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the  sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared  with the glory which shall be revealed in us,(4) nor would they  be even if thou wert to endure them all.    11. When thou hast come to this, that tribulation is sweet and  pleasant to thee for Christ's sake, then reckon that it is well  with thee, because thou hast found paradise on earth.  So long as  it is hard to thee to suffer and thou desirest to escape, so long  it will not be well with thee, and tribulations will follow thee  everywhere.    12. If thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest, namely, to  suffer and to die, it shall soon go better with thee, and thou  shalt find peace.  Though thou shouldest be caught up with Paul  unto the third heaven,(5) thou art not on that account secure  from suffering evil.  I will show him, saith Jesus, what great  things he must suffer for My Name's sake.(6)  It remaineth,  therefore, to thee to suffer, if thou wilt love Jesus and serve  Him continually.    13. Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of  Jesus, how great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among  all the saints of God, what bright example also to thy neighbour!  For all men commend patience, although few be willing to practise  it.  Thou oughtest surely to suffer a little for Christ when many  suffer heavier things for the world.    14. Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of  a dying man.  And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he  beginneth to live towards God.  None is fit for the understanding  of heavenly things, unless he hath submitted himself to bearing  adversities for Christ.  Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing  more healthful for thyself in this world, than to suffer  willingly for Christ.  And if it were thine to choose, thou  oughtest rather to wish to suffer adversities for Christ, than to  be refreshed with manifold consolations, for thou wouldest be  more like Christ and more conformed to all saints.  For our  worthiness and growth in grace lieth not in many delights and  consolations, but rather in bearing many troubles and  adversities.    15. If indeed there had been anything better and more profitable  to the health of men than to suffer, Christ would surely have  shown it by word and example.  For both the disciples who  followed Him, and all who desire to follow Him, He plainly  exhorteth to bear their cross, and saith, If any man will come  after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow  Me.(7)  So now that we have thoroughly read and studied all  things, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.  We must  through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.(8)    (1) Matthew xvi. 24.   (2) Matthew xxv. 41.   (3) Luke xxiv. 46.  (4) Romans viii. 18.   (5) 2 Corinthians xii. 2.  (6) Acts ix. 16.   (7) Luke ix. 23.   (8) Acts xiv. 21.          THE THIRD BOOK        ON INWARD CONSOLATION    CHAPTER I    Of the inward voice of Christ to the faithful soul    I will hearken what the Lord God shall say within me.(1)  Blessed  is the soul which heareth the Lord speaking within it, and  receiveth the word of consolation from His mouth.  Blessed are  the ears which receive the echoes of the soft whisper of God, and  turn not aside to the whisperings of this world.  Blessed truly  are the ears which listen not to the voice that soundeth without,  but to that which teacheth truth inwardly.  Blessed are the eyes  which are closed to things without, but are fixed upon things  within.  Blessed are they who search inward things and study to  prepare themselves more and more by daily exercises for the  receiving of heavenly mysteries.  Blessed are they who long to  have leisure for God, and free themselves from every hindrance of  the world.  Think on these things, O my soul, and shut the doors  of thy carnal desires, so mayest thou hear what the Lord God will  say within thee.    2. These things saith thy Beloved, \"I am thy salvation, I am thy  peace and thy life.  Keep thee unto Me, and thou shalt find  peace.\"  Put away thee all transitory things, seek those things  that are eternal.  For what are all temporal things but deceits,  and what shall all created things help thee if thou be forsaken  by the Creator?  Therefore put all things else away, and give  thyself to the Creator, to be well pleasing and faithful to Him,  that thou mayest be able to attain true blessedness.    (1) Psalm lxxxv. 8.      CHAPTER II    What the truth saith inwardly without noise of words    Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth.(1)  I am Thy servant; O give  me understanding that I may know Thy testimonies.  Incline my  heart unto the words of Thy mouth.(2)  Let thy speech distil as  the dew.  The children of Israel spake in old time to Moses,  Speak thou unto us and we will hear, but let not the Lord speak  unto us lest we die.(3)  Not thus, O Lord, not thus do I pray,  but rather with Samuel the prophet, I beseech Thee humbly and  earnestly, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.  Let not Moses  speak to me, nor any prophet, but rather speak Thou, O Lord, who  didst inspire and illuminate all the prophets; for Thou alone  without them canst perfectly fill me with knowledge, whilst they  without Thee shall profit nothing.    2. They can indeed utter words, but they give not the spirit.  They speak with exceeding beauty, but when Thou art silent they  kindle not the heart.  They give us scriptures, but Thou makest  known the sense thereof.  They bring us mysteries, but Thou  revealest the things which are signified.  They utter  commandments, but Thou helpest to the fulfilling of them.  They  show the way, but Thou givest strength for the journey.  They act  only outwardly, but Thou dost instruct and enlighten the heart.  They water, but Thou givest the increase.  They cry with words,  but Thou givest understanding to the hearer.    3. Therefore let not Moses speak to me, but Thou, O Lord my God,  Eternal Truth; lest I die and bring forth no fruit, being  outwardly admonished, but not enkindled within; lest the word  heard but not followed, known but not loved, believed but not  obeyed, rise up against me in the judgment.  Speak, Lord, for Thy  servant heareth; Thou hast the words of eternal life.(4)  Speak  unto me for some consolation unto my soul, for the amendment of  my whole life, and for the praise and glory and eternal honour of  Thy Name.    (1) 1 Samuel iii. 9.   (2) Psalm cxix. 125.   (3) Exodus xx. 19.  (4) John vi. 68.      CHAPTER III    How all the words of God are to be heard with humility, and how  many consider them not    \"My Son, hear My words, for My words are most sweet, surpassing  all the knowledge of the philosophers and wise men of this world.  My words are spirit, and they are life,(1) and are not to be  weighed by man's understanding.  They are not to be drawn forth  for vain approbation, but to be heard in silence, and to be  received with all humility and with deep love.\"    2. And I said, \"Blessed is the man whom Thou teachest, O Lord,  and instructest him in Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest in  time of adversity,(2) and that he be not desolate in the earth.\"    3. \"I,\" saith the Lord, \"taught the prophets from the beginning,  and even now cease I not to speak unto all; but many are deaf and  hardened against My voice; many love to listen to the world  rather than to God, they follow after the desires of the flesh  more readily than after the good pleasure of God.  The world  promiseth things that are temporal and small, and it is served  with great eagerness.  I promise things that are great and  eternal, and the hearts of mortals are slow to stir.

On their state visit to St. Paul's,  September 30th following, the greatest congregation that had ever  yet assembled there was gathered to see them. But as great, so says  Machyn[2], assembled again on the first Sunday in Advent to receive  Cardinal Pole as Papal Legate. Three days before, on the Feast of St.  Andrew, he had absolved England at Westminster Hall, and received it  back to Communion. Now, having landed at Baynard's Castle Wharf, he  was conducted by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, Lord Chancellor and  Bishops, all in splendid procession, followed by a retinue of nobles  and knights, with the legate's cross carried before him, King Philip  and Queen Mary walking by his side on the right hand and the left.  Gardiner preached at Paul's Cross, the first part penitent, the latter  exultant, and ending with the words, \"Verily this is the great day of  the Lord.\"    Of one passage in the history of this time we can speak with  unqualified approval. On August 5th, 1554, the Lord Mayor (White)  issued the following Proclamation:--        \"Forasmuch as the material temples or churches of God were first      ordained and instituted and made in all places for the lawful and      devout assembly of the people there to lift up their hearts and to      laud and praise Almighty God and to hear His Divine Service and      most holy Word and Gospel sincerely said, sung, and taught, and      not to be used as market places or other profane places, or common      thoroughfares with carriage of things; and that now of late years      many of the inhabitants of this City of London, and other people      repairing to the same, have and yet do commonly use and accustom      themselves very unseemly and unreverently; the more is the pity to      make the common carriage of great vessels full of ale and beer,      great baskets full of bread, fish, fruit, and such other things,      fardels [bundles] of stuff and other gross wares through the      Cathedral Church of St. Paul within the said City of London, and      some in leading of horses, mules, or other beasts through the same      unreverently, to the great dishonour and displeasure of Almighty      God, and the great grief also and offence of all good and      well-disposed persons. Be it therefore for remedy and reformation      thereof ordained, enacted, and established by the Lord Mayor,      Aldermen, and Commons in this present Common Council assembled      and by the authority of the same, according to the privileges and      customs of this ancient city that no manner of person or persons,      either free of the said city or foreign, of what estate,      condition, or degree soever he or they be, do at any time from      henceforth carry, or convey, or cause to be conveyed or carried      through the said Cathedral Church of St. Paul any manner of great      vessel or vessels, basket or baskets, with bread, ale, beer,      flesh, fruit, fish, fardells of stuff, wood billets, faggots,      mule, horse, or other beasts, or any other like thing or things,      upon pain of forfeiture and losing for every such his or their      offence iii_s._ iiij_d._, and for the second like offence vi_s._      viij_d._, and for the third offence x_s._, and for every other      offence after such third time to forfeit and lose like sum, and      to suffer imprisonment by the space of two whole days and nights      without bail or mainprise. The one moiety of all which pains and      penalties shall be to the use of the poor called Christ's Hospital      within Newgate for the time being, and the other moiety thereof      shall be to the use of him or them that will sue for the same in      any Court of Record within same City by bill, original plaint,      or information, to be commenced and sued in the name of the      chamberlains of the said city for the time being, wherein none      essoyne [exemption] or wages of law for the defendants shall be      admitted or allowed.        \"God save the King and Queen.\"    (Guildhall Records.)      We have had the grand ceremonial at the Reconciliation to Rome.  Another procession--oh! the pity of it--was held on St. Paul's Day,  1550, of 160 priests, with Bishop Bonner at the head, singing their  thanksgiving that the Queen was about to become a mother, and on the  following April 30th, came the report that a prince was born. Again  the bells rang out, and solemn _Te Deum_ was sung! Machyn tells of the  disappointment which followed, and expresses his hope for the future,  hope not to be fulfilled.    What was it turned the tide of religious opinion? The answer admits of  no doubt. John Rogers, the proto-martyr of the English Reformation,  was a prebendary of St. Paul's, a man of saintly life. He had given  much help to Tyndale, the translator of the Bible, had brought the MS.  to England, and published it. He was sentenced to be burned only three  days after the reception of Pole, and died with dauntless courage,  even his wife and children encouraging him. In the following October,  his Bishop and patron, Ridley, also died the same fiery death. Machyn  records, with apparent callousness, the burnings which went on in  Smithfield day after day, along with trifling incidents and stately  ceremonials at St. Paul's. He does not realise that these things were  horrifying the English people, and turning their hearts steadfastly  to the persecuted faith. The greater number of the martyr fires took  place in London, and St. Paul's was the place of trial. On the 13th of  November, 1558, the Queen issued a brief to Bonner, giving him command  to burn heretics without mercy, and four days later she died, as, on  the same day, did Cardinal Pole.    The heart of England was alienated from a religion which had resorted  to such brutalities, and the doctrines of the Reformation were  everywhere received. Queen Elizabeth, however, would not be  incautious. There was no immediate interference with the Marian  ceremonial. There was a solemn Requiem Mass sung at St. Paul's after  the death of Henry II. of France, July, 1559, but by this time the  restored images had again been removed. One day, when she came to St.  Paul's, Dean Nowell placed in her pew a prayer-book richly illuminated  with German scriptural engravings. She was very angry, and demanded to  know who had placed \"this idolatrous book\" on her cushion. The poor  Dean explained, and her Majesty was satisfied, but \"prayed God to give  him more wisdom for the future.\" She expressed her satisfaction that  the pictures were German and not English. Some years later the same  Dean offended her in the opposite direction. It was on Ash Wednesday,  1572; he was preaching before her, and denounced certain \"Popish  superstitions,\" among them the use of the sign of the Cross. Her  Majesty called out to him sternly to \"stick to his text.\" The next day  he sent her a humble apology.    Paul's Cross was silent for some months; when at length it was again  occupied the Reformed faith was reasserted. Bonner was sent to the  Tower, and the English Communion service was again in use. In the  following August, the Queen's Commissioners held a Visitation in St.  Paul's, at which all who refused to conform with it were pronounced  contumacious and deprived. The rood was again turned out, as were the  images, and now it was with the approval of the people at large. In  many places there was much violence displayed in the destruction,  but not in St. Paul's. All was done there without tumult, and with  discrimination. On December 17th, 1559, Parker was consecrated  Archbishop at Lambeth, and four days later he consecrated Grindal  Bishop of London. Bonner was sent to the Marshalsea Prison, which  Strype declares was done to screen him from the popular detestation.  He was well fed and housed there, and had \"much enjoyment of his  garden and orchards,\" until his death in 1569.    Grindal had been warmly attached to Ridley, and still loved his memory  dearly. Moreover, he had himself been an exile for his opinions. He  was not, therefore, likely to look favourably upon the old ceremonial,  even in its modified form of stately solemnity and grace, such as  Tallis and Merbecke would have preserved to it. And his Dean, Nowell,  had the same distrust. Had they favoured it, in all probability the  moderate and beautiful rendering of the Liturgy, as it is heard in the  cathedral in our day, would not only have won the affections of the  people at large, but would have arrested the strong tide of Puritanism  and iconoclasm which was now rising. In Convocation, the Puritans  nearly carried the removal of all organs from churches. They lost it  by a majority of one, and Dean Nowell was in the minority.    Whilst the controversy was at its fiercest, on the 3rd of June, 1561,  a violent thunderstorm burst over London. The Church of St. Martin's,  Ludgate, was struck by lightning, and great masses of stones came down  upon the pavement. Whilst people were looking dismayed at this,  the steeple of St. Paul's was discovered to be on fire. The timber  framework had got ablaze, the lead which covered it poured down like  lava upon the roof, the very bells melted. For four hours the whole  cathedral was in danger, but happily, with the exception of the  roof of the nave, the church was saved. As soon as the flames were  extinguished, Pilkington, whose works are published by the Parker  Society, furiously declared that it was all owing to the retention of  Popery, and the other side, with equal vigour, attributed the disaster  to the desecration by the Puritans.[3]    The steeple was never rebuilt, but the nave roof was begun without  loss of time. Queen Elizabeth sent letters to the Lord Mayor,  commanding him to take immediate steps, gave him 1000 marks from her  own"]]]
