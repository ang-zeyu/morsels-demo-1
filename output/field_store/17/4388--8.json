The young Salarik had  greater agility and speed, but the veteran who faced him had the  experience.    To Terran eyes the duel had some of the weaving, sweeping movements of  the earlier ritual dance. The swift evasions of the nets were graceful  and so timed that many times the meshes grazed the skin of the fighter  who fled entrapment.    Dane believed that the elder man was tiring, and the youngster must have  shared that opinion. There was a leap to the right, a sudden flurry of  dart and retreat, and then a net curled high and fell, enfolding flailing  arms and kicking legs. When the clutch rope was jerked tight, the  captured youth was thrown off balance. He rolled frenziedly, but there  was no escaping the imprisoning strands.    A shout applauded the victor. He stood now above his captive who lay  supine, his throat or breast ready for either stroke of the knife his  captor wished to deliver. But it appeared that the winner was not minded  to end the encounter with blood. Instead he reached out a long, befurred  arm, took up a filled goblet from the table and with serious  deliberation, poured its contents onto the upturned face of the loser.    For a moment there was a dead silence around the feast board and then a  second roar, to which the honestly relieved Terrans added spurts of  laughter. The sputtering youth was shaken free of the net and went down  on his knees, tendering his opponent his knife, which the other thrust  along with his own into his sash belt. Dane gathered from overheard  remarks that the younger man was, for a period of time, to be determined  by clan council, now the servant-slave of his overthrower and that since  they were closely united by blood ties, this solution was considered  eminently suitable--though had the elder killed his opponent, no one  would have thought the worse of him for that deed.    It was the Queen's men who were to provide the next center of attraction.  Groft climbed down from his high seat and came to face across the board  those who had accompanied him on the hunt. This time there was no  escaping the sipping of the potent drink which the new chieftain slopped  from his own goblet into each of theirs.    The fiery mouthful almost gagged Dane, but he swallowed manfully and  hoped for the best as it burned like acid down his throat into his  middle, there to mix uncomfortably with the viands he had eaten. Weeks'  thin face looked very white, and Dane noticed with malicious enjoyment,  that Ali had an unobtrusive grip on the table which made his knuckles  stand out in polished knobs--proving that there _were_ things which could  upset the imperturbable Kamil.    Fortunately they were _not_ required to empty that flowing bowl in one  gulp as Groft had done. The ceremonial mouthful was deemed enough and  Dane sat down thankfully--but with uneasy fears for the future.    Groft had started back to his high seat when there was an interruption  which had not been foreseen. A messenger threaded his way among the  serving men and spoke to the chieftain, who glanced at the Terrans and  then nodded.    Dane, his queasiness growing every second, was not attending until he  heard a bitten off word from Rip's direction and looked up to see a party  of I-S men coming into the open space before the high seat. The men from  the Queen stiffened--there was something in the attitude of the newcomers  which hinted at trouble.    \"What do you wish, sky lords?\" That was Groft using the Trade Lingo, his  eyes half closed as he lolled in his chair of state, almost as if he were  about to witness some entertainment provided for his pleasure.    \"We wish to offer you the good fortune desires of our hearts--\" That was  Kallee, the flowery words rolling with the proper accent from his tongue.  \"And that you shall not forget us--we also offer gifts--\"    At a gesture from their Cargo-master, the I-S men set down a small chest.  Groft, his chin resting on a clenched fist, lost none of his lazy air.    \"They are received,\" he retorted with the formal acceptance. \"And no one  can have too much good fortune. The Howlers of the Black Winds know  that.\" But he tendered no invitation to join the feast.    Kallee did not appear to be disconcerted. His next move was one which  took his rivals by surprise, in spite of their suspicions.    \"Under the laws of the Fellowship, O, Groft,\" he clung to the formal  speech, \"I claim redress--\"    Ali's hand moved. Through his growing distress Dane saw Van Rycke's jaw  tighten, the fighting mask snap back on Captain Jellico's face. Whatever  came now was real trouble.    Groft's eyes flickered over the party from the Queen. Though he had just  pledged cup friendship with four of them, he had the malicious humor of  his race. He would make no move to head off what might be coming.    \"By the right of the knife and the net,\" he intoned, \"you have the power  to claim personal satisfaction. Where is your enemy?\"    Kallee turned to face the Free Traders. \"I hereby challenge a champion to  be set out from these off-worlders to meet by the blood and by the water  my champion--\"    The Salariki were getting excited. This was superb entertainment, an  engagement such as they had never hoped to see--alien against alien. The  rising murmur of their voices was like the growl of a hunting beast.    Groft smiled and the pleasure that expression displayed was neither  Terran--nor human. But then the clan leader was not either, Dane reminded  himself.    \"Four of these warriors are clan-bound,\" he said. \"But the others may  produce a champion--\"    Dane looked along the line of his comrades--Ali, Rip, Weeks and himself  had just been ruled out. That left Jellico, Van Rycke, Karl Kosti, the  giant jetman whose strength they had to rely upon before, Stotz the  Engineer, Medic Tau and Steen Wilcox. If it were strength alone he would  have chosen Kosti, but the big man was not too quick a thinker--    Jellico got to his feet, the embodiment of a star lane fighting man. In  the flickering light the scar on his cheek seemed to ripple. \"Who's your  champion?\" he asked Kallee.    The Eysie Cargo-master was grinning. He was confident he had pushed them  into a position from which they could not extricate themselves.    \"You accept challenge?\" he countered.    Jellico merely repeated his question and Kallee beckoned forward one of  his men.    The Eysie who stepped up was no match for Kosti. He was a slender, almost  wand-slim young man, whose pleased smirk said that he, too, was about to  put something over on the notorious Free Traders. Jellico studied him for  a couple of long seconds during which the hum of Salariki voices was the  threatening buzz of a disturbed wasps' nest. There was no way out of  this--to refuse conflict was to lose all they had won with the clansmen.  And they did not doubt that Kallee had, in some way, triggered the scales  against them.    Jellico made the best of it. \"We accept challenge,\" his voice was level.  \"We, being guesting in Groft's holding, will fight after the manner of  the Salariki who are proven warriors--\" He paused as roars of pleased  acknowledgment arose around the board.    \"Therefore let us follow the custom of warriors and take up the net and  the knife--\"    Was there a shade of dismay on Kallee's face?    \"And the time?\" Groft leaned forward to ask--but his satisfaction at such  a fine ending for his feast was apparent. This would be talked over by  every Sargolian for many storm seasons to come!    Jellico glanced up at the sky. \"Say an hour after dawn, chieftain. With  your leave, we shall confer concerning a champion.\"    \"My council room is yours,\" Groft signed for a liege man to guide them.          Chapter VII    BARRING ACCIDENT      The morning winds rustled through the grass forest and, closer to hand,  it pulled at the cloaks of the Salariki. Clan nobles sat on stools,  lesser folk squatted on the trampled stubble of the cleared ground  outside the stockade. In their many colored splendor the drab tunics of  the Terrans were a blot of darkness at either end of the makeshift arena  which had been marked out for them.    At the conclusion of their conference the Queen's men had been forced  into a course Jellico had urged from the first. He, and he alone, would  represent the Free Traders in the coming duel. And now he stood there in  the early morning, stripped down to shorts and boots, wearing nothing on  which a net could catch and so trap him. The Free Traders were certain  that the I-S men having any advantage would press it to the ultimate  limit and the death of Captain Jellico would make a great impression on  the Salariki.    Jellico was taller than the Eysie who faced him, but almost as lean. Hard  muscles moved under his skin, pale where space tan had not burned in the  years of his star voyaging. And his every movement was with the liquid  grace of a man who, in his time, had been a master of the force blade.  Now he gripped in his left hand the claw knife given him by Groft himself  and in the other he looped the throwing rope of the net.    At the other end of the field, the Eysie man was industriously moving his  bootsoles back and forth across the ground, intent upon coating them with  as much of the gritty sand as would adhere. And he displayed the supreme  confidence in himself which he had shown at the moment of challenge in  the Great Hall.    None of the Free Trading party made the mistake of trying to give Jellico  advice. The Captain had not risen to his command without learning his  duties. And the duties of a Free Trader covered a wide range of knowledge  and practice. One had to be equally expert with a blaster and a slingshot  when the occasion demanded. Though Jellico had not fought a Salariki duel  with net and knife before, he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#12)"],[1,"the general  disturbance had deserted the legion. Their decision for one side or  the other would be of the first importance. Nonius, Donatius,  Romilius, and Calpurnius, the centurions mentioned above,[114] were  executed by order of Vitellius. They had been convicted of loyalty, a  heinous offence among deserters. His party soon gained the accession  of Valerius Asiaticus, governor of Belgica, who subsequently married  Vitellius' daughter, and of Junius Blaesus,[115] governor of the Lyons  division of Gaul, who brought with him the Italian legion[116] and a  regiment of cavalry known as 'Taurus' Horse',[117] which had been  quartered at Lugdunum. The forces in Raetia lost no time in joining  his standard, and even the troops in Britain showed no hesitation.  Trebellius Maximus, the governor of Britain, had earned by his          60  meanness and cupidity the contempt and hatred of the army,[118] which  was further inflamed by the action of his old enemy Roscius Coelius,  who commanded the Twentieth legion, and they now seized the  opportunity of the civil war to break out into a fierce quarrel.  Trebellius blamed Coelius for the mutinous temper and insubordination  of the army: Coelius complained that Trebellius had robbed his men and  impaired their efficiency. Meanwhile their unseemly quarrel ruined the  discipline of the forces, whose insubordination soon came to a head.  The auxiliary horse and foot joined in the attacks on the governor,  and rallied round Coelius. Trebellius, thus hunted out and abandoned,  took refuge with Vitellius. The province remained quiet, despite the  removal of the ex-consul. The government was carried on by the  commanding officers of the legions, who were equal in authority,  though Coelius' audacity gave him an advantage over the rest.    Thus reinforced by the army from Britain,[119] Vitellius, who now       61  had an immense force and vast resources at his disposal, decided on an  invasion by two routes under two separate generals. Fabius Valens was  to lure the Gauls to his standard, or, if they refused, to devastate  their country, and then invade Italy by way of the Cottian Alps.[120]  Caecina was to follow the shorter route and descend into Italy over  the Pennine Pass.[121] Valens' column comprised the Fifth legion with  its 'eagle',[122] and some picked detachments from the army of Lower  Germany, together with auxiliary horse and foot, amounting in all to  40,000 men. Caecina's troops from Upper Germany numbered 30,000, their  main strength consisting in the Twenty-first legion.[123] Both columns  were reinforced by German auxiliaries, whom Vitellius also recruited  to fill up his own army, intending to follow with the main force of  the attack.    Strange was the contrast between Vitellius and his army. The            62  soldiers were all eagerness, clamouring for battle at once, while Gaul  was still frightened and Spain still undecided. Winter was no obstacle  to them; peace and delay were for cowards: they must invade Italy and  seize Rome: haste was the safest course in civil war, where action is  better than deliberation. Vitellius was dully apathetic, anticipating  his high station by indulging in idle luxury and lavish  entertainments. At midday he would be drunk and drowsy with  over-eating. However, such was the zeal of the soldiers that they even  did the general's duties, and behaved exactly as if he had been  present to encourage the alert and threaten the laggards. They  promptly fell in and began to clamour for the signal to start. The  title of Germanicus was then and there conferred on Vitellius: Caesar  he would never be called, even after his victory.

THE MARCH OF VALENS' COLUMN    On the very day of departure a happy omen greeted Fabius Valens and  the army under his command. As the column advanced, an eagle flew  steadily ahead and seemed to lead the way. Loudly though the soldiers  cheered, hour after hour the bird flew undismayed, and was taken for a  sure omen of success.    They passed peaceably through the country of the Treviri, who were      63  allies. At Divodurum,[124] the chief town of the Mediomatrici,  although they were welcomed with all courtesy, the troops fell into a  sudden panic. Hastily seizing their arms, they began to massacre the  innocent citizens. Their object was not plunder. They were seized by a  mad frenzy, which was the harder to allay as its cause was a mystery.  Eventually the general's entreaties prevailed, and they refrained from  destroying the town. However, nearly 4,000 men had already been  killed. This spread such alarm throughout Gaul, that, as the army  approached, whole towns flocked out with their magistrates at their  head and prayers for mercy in their mouths. Women and boys prostrated  themselves along the roads, and they resorted to every possible means  by which an enemy's anger may be appeased,[125] petitioning for peace,  though war there was none.    It was in the country of the Leuci[126] that Valens heard the news      64  of Galba's murder and Otho's elevation. The soldiers showed no  emotion, neither joy nor fear: their thoughts were all for war. The  Gauls' doubts were now decided. They hated Otho and Vitellius equally,  but Vitellius they also feared. They next reached the Lingones,  faithful adherents of their party. There the courtesy of the citizens  was only equalled by the good behaviour of the troops. But this did  not last for long, thanks to the disorderly conduct of the Batavian  auxiliaries, who, as narrated above,[127] had detached themselves from  the Fourteenth legion and been drafted into Valens' column. A quarrel  between some Batavians and legionaries led to blows: the other  soldiers quickly took sides, and a fierce battle would have ensued,  had not Valens punished a few of the Batavians to remind them of the  discipline they seemed to have forgotten.    Coming to the Aedui,[128] they in vain sought an excuse for fighting.  For when the natives were ordered to contribute money and arms, they  brought a gratuitous present of provisions as well. Lugdunum did  gladly what the Aedui had done from fear. But the town was deprived of  the Italian legion and Taurus' Horse.[129] Valens decided to leave the  Eighteenth cohort[130] there in its old winter quarters as a garrison.  Manlius Valens, who was in command of the Italian legion, never  received any distinction from Vitellius, although he deserved well of  the party, the reason being that Fabius slandered him behind his back,  while to avert"]]]
