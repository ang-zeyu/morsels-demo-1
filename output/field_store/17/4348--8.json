Many  prayers contain requests for the things that tend to the comfort and  general well-being of the dead, but here and there we find a prayer for  forgiveness of sins committed in the body. The best example of such is  the prayer that forms Chapter CXXVI. It reads: \"Hail, ye four Ape-gods  who sit in the bows of the Boat of Ra, who convey truth to Nebertchet,  who sit in judgment on my weakness and on my strength, who make the gods  to rest contented by means of the flame of your mouths, who offer holy  offerings to the gods, and sepulchral meals to the spirit-souls, who  live upon truth, who feed upon truth of heart, who are without deceit  and fraud, and to whom wickedness is an abomination, do ye away with my  evil deeds, and put ye away my sin, which deserved stripes upon earth,  and destroy ye every evil thing whatsoever that clingeth to me, and let  there be no bar whatsoever on my part towards you. Grant ye that I may  make my way through the Amhet[1] chamber, let me enter into Rastau,[2]  and let me pass through the secret places of Amentet. Grant that cakes,  and ale, and sweetmeats may be given to me as they are given to the  spirit-souls, and grant that I may enter in and come forth from Rastau.\"  The four Ape-gods reply: \"Come, for we have done away with thy  wickedness, and we have put away thy sin, which deserved stripes, which  thou didst commit upon earth, and we have destroyed all the evil that  clung to thee. Enter, therefore, into Rastau, and pass in through the  secret gates of Amentet, and cakes, and ale, and sweetmeats shall be  given unto thee, and thou shalt go in and come out at thy desire, even  as do those whose spirit-souls are praised [by the god], and [thy name]  shall be proclaimed each day in the horizon.\"    [Footnote 1: A chamber in the kingdom of Seker in which the dead were  examined.]    [Footnote 2: The corridors in the kingdom of Seker.]    Another prayer of special interest is that which forms Chapter XXXB.  This is put into the mouth of the deceased when he is standing in the  Hall of Judgment watching the weighing of his heart in the Great Scales  by Anubis and Thoth, in the presence of the Great Company of the gods  and Osiris. He says: \"My heart, my mother. My heart, my mother. My heart  whereby I came into being. Let none stand up to oppose me at my  judgment. May there be no opposition to me in the presence of the  Tchatchau.[1] Mayest thou not be separated from me in the presence of  the Keeper of the Balance. Thou art my Ka (_i.e._ Double, or vital  power), that dwelleth in my body; the god Khnemu who knitteth together  and strengthened my limbs. Mayest thou come forth into the place of  happiness whither we go. May the Shenit officers who decide the  destinies of the lives of men not cause my name to stink [before  Osiris]. Let it (_i.e._ the weighing) be satisfactory unto us, and let  there be joy of heart to us at the weighing of words (_i.e._ the Great  Judgment). Let not that which is false be uttered against me before the  Great God, the Lord of Amentet (_i.e._ Osiris). Verily thou shalt be  great when thou risest up [having been declared] a speaker of the  truth.\"    [Footnote 1: The chief officers of Osiris, the divine Taskmasters.]    In many papyri this prayer is followed by a Rubric, which orders that it  is to be said over a green stone scarab set in a band of _tchamu_ metal  (_i.e._ silver-gold), which is to be hung by a ring from the neck of the  deceased. Some Rubrics order it to be placed in the breast of a mummy,  where it is to take the place of the heart, and say that it will \"open  the mouth\" of the deceased. A tradition which is as old as the twelfth  dynasty says that the Chapter was discovered in the town of Khemenu  (Hermopolis Magna) by Herutataf, the son of Khufu, in the reign of  Menkaura, a king of the fourth dynasty. It was cut in hieroglyphs,  inlaid with lapis-lazuli on a block of alabaster, which was set under  the feet of Thoth, and was therefore believed to be a most powerful  prayer. We know that this prayer was recited by the Egyptians in the  Ptolemaic Period, and thus it is clear that it was in common use for a  period of nearly four thousand years. It may well be the oldest prayer  in the world. Under the Middle and New Empires this prayer was cut upon  hard green stone scarabs, but the versions of it found on scarabs are  often incomplete and full of mistakes. It is quite clear that the prayer  was turned into a spell, and that it was used merely as a \"word of  power,\" and that the hard stone scarabs were regarded merely as amulets.  On many of them spaces are found that have been left blank to receive  the names of those with whom they were to be buried; this proves that  such scarabs once formed part of some undertaker's stock-in-trade, and  that they were kept ready for those who were obliged to buy \"heart  scarabs\" in a hurry.    Another remarkable composition in the Book of the Dead is the first part  of Chapter CXXV, which well illustrates the lofty moral conceptions of  the Egyptians of the eighteenth dynasty. The deceased is supposed to be  standing in the \"Usekht Maati,\" or Hall of the Two Maati goddesses, one  for Upper Egypt and one for Lower Egypt, wherein Osiris and his  Forty-two Judges judge the souls of the dead. Before judgment is given  the deceased is allowed to make a declaration, which in form closely  resembles that made in many parts of Africa at the present day by a man  who is condemned to undergo the ordeal of drinking \"red water,\" and in  it he states that he has not committed offences against the moral and  religious laws of his country. He says:    \"Homage to thee, O Great God, thou Lord of Maati. I have come to thee, O  my Lord, and I have brought myself hither that I may behold thy  beauties. I know thee. I know thy name. I know the names of the  Forty-two[1] gods who live with thee in this Hall of Truth, who keep  ward over sinners, and who feed upon their blood on the day when the  lives of men are taken into account in the presence of Un-Nefer (_i.e._  the Good Being or Osiris).... Verily, I have come unto thee, I have  brought truth unto thee. I have destroyed wickedness for thee. I have  not done evil to men. I have not oppressed (or wronged) my family. I  have not done wrong instead of right. I have not been a friend of  worthless men. I have not wrought evil. I have not tried to make myself  over-righteous. I have not put forward my name for exalted positions. I  have not entreated servants evilly. I have not defrauded the man who was  in trouble. I have not done what is hateful (or taboo) to the gods. I  have not caused a servant to be ill-treated by his master. I have not  caused pain [to any man]. I have not permitted any man to go hungry. I  have made none to weep. I have not committed murder. I have not ordered  any man to commit murder for me. I have inflicted pain on no man. I have  not robbed the temples of their offerings. I have not stolen the cakes  of the gods. I have not carried off the cakes offered to the spirits. I  have not committed fornication. I have not committed acts of impurity in  the holy places of the god of my town. I have not diminished the bushel.  I have not added to or filched away land. I have not encroached upon the  fields [of my neighbours]. I have not added to the weights of the  scales. I have not falsified the pointer of the scales. I have not taken  milk from the mouths of children. I have not driven away the cattle that  were upon their pastures. I have not snared the feathered fowl in the  preserves of the gods. I have not caught fish [with bait made of] fish  of their kind. I have not stopped water at the time [when it should  flow]. I have not breached a canal of running water. I have not  extinguished a fire when it should burn. I have not violated the times  [of offering] chosen meat-offerings. I have not driven off the cattle  from the property of the gods. I have not repulsed the god in his  manifestations. I am pure. I am pure. I am pure. I am pure.\"    [Footnote 1: The Forty-two gods represent the forty-two nomes, or  counties, into which Egypt was divided.]    [Illustration: Her-Heru and Queen Netchemet standing in the Hall of  Osiris and praying to the God, whilst the Heart of the Queen is being  weighed in the Balance. _From a papyrus (about 1050 B.C.) in the British  Museum._]    In the second part of the Chapter the deceased repeats many of the above  declarations of his innocence, but with each declaration the name of one  of the Forty-two Judges is coupled. Thus we have:         1. \"Hail, thou of the long strides, who comest forth from       Heliopolis, I have not committed sin.         2. \"Hail, thou who art embraced by flame, who comest forth from       Kheraha, I have not robbed with violence.         3. \"Hail, Nose, who comest forth from Hermopolis, I have not done       violence [to any man].         4. \"Hail, Eater of shadows, who comest forth from the Qerti, I have       not thieved.         5. \"Hail, Stinking Face, who comest forth from Rastau, I have not       slain man or woman.

He  would place his forearms akimbo on the edge of the float, and lift  himself up a bit, like a little old man, and stare steadfastly at the  light. And there he would stay as long as I let him, just staring and  blinking.    Soon two other points of light would come stealing in from the other  side, and another frog would set his elbows on the float and stare  hard across at the first-comer. And then two more shining points, and  two more, till twelve or fifteen frogs were gathered about my beacon,  as thick as they could find elbow room on the float, all staring and  blinking like so many strange water owls come up from the bottom to  debate weighty things, with a little flickering will-o'-the-wisp  nodding grave assent in the midst of them. But never a word was  spoken; the silence was perfect.    Sometimes one, more fascinated or more curious than the others, would  climb onto the float, and put his nose solemnly into the light. Then  there would be a loud sizzle, a jump, and a splash; the candle would  go out, and the wondering circle of frogs scatter to the lily pads  again, all swimming as if in a trance, dipping their heads under water  to wash the light from their bewildered eyes.    They were quite fearless, almost senseless, at such times. I would  stretch out my hand from the shadow, pick up an unresisting frog that  threatened too soon to climb onto the float, and examine him at  leisure. But Chigwooltz is wedded to his idols; the moment I released  him he would go, fast as his legs could carry him, to put his elbows  on the float and stare at the light again.    Among the frogs, and especially among the toads, as among most wild  animals, certain individuals attach themselves strongly to man, drawn  doubtless by some unknown but no less strongly felt attraction. It was  so there in the wilderness. The first morning after our arrival at the  birch grove I was down at the shore, preparing a trout for baking in  the ashes, when Chigwooltz, of the ear drums, biggest of all the  frogs, came from among the lily pads. He had lost all fear apparently;  he swam directly up to me, touching my hands with his nose, and even  crawling out to my feet in the greatest curiosity.    After that he took up his abode near the foot of the game path. I had  only to splash the water there with my finger when he would come from  beside a green stone, or from under a log or the lily pads--for he  had a dozen hiding places--and swim up to me to be fed, or petted, or  to have his back scratched.    He ate all sorts of things, insects, bread, beef, game and fish,  either raw or cooked. I would attach a bit of meat to a string or  straw, and wiggle it before him, to make it seem alive. The moment he  saw it (he had a queer way sometimes of staring hard at a thing  without seeing it) he would crouch and creep towards it, nearer and  nearer, softly and more softly, like a cat stalking a chipmunk. Then  there would be a red flash and the meat would be gone. The red flash  was his tongue, which is attached at the outer end and folds back in  his mouth. It is, moreover, large and sticky, and he can throw it out  and back like lightning. All you see is the red flash of it, and his  game is gone.    One day, to try the effects of nicotine on a new subject, I took a bit  of Simmo's black tobacco and gave it to Chigwooltz. He ate it  thankfully, as he did everything else I gave him. In a little while he  grew uneasy, sitting up and rubbing his belly with his fore paws.  Presently he brought his stomach up into his mouth, turned it inside  out to get rid of the tobacco, washed it thoroughly in the lake,  swallowed it down again, and was ready for his bread and beef. A most  convenient arrangement that; and also a perfectly unbiased opinion on  a much debated subject.    Chigwooltz, unlike many of my pets, was not in the least dependent on  my bounty. Indeed, he was a remarkable hunter on his own account, and  what he took from me he took as hospitality, not charity. One morning  he came to me with the tail of a small trout sticking out of his  mouth. The rest of the fish was below, being digested. Another day,  towards twilight, I saw him resting on the lily pads, looking very  full, with a suspicious-looking object curling out over his under lip.  I wiggled my finger in the water, and he came from pure sociability,  for he was beyond eating any more. The suspicious-looking object  proved to be a bird's foot, and beside it was a pointed wing tip. That  was too much for my curiosity. I opened his mouth and pulled out the  bird with some difficulty, for Chigwooltz had been engaged some time  in the act of swallowing his game and had it well down. It proved to  be a full-grown male swallow, without a mark anywhere to show how he  had come by his death. Chigwooltz looked at me reproachfully, but  swallowed his game promptly the moment I had finished examining it.    There was small doubt in my mind that he had caught his bird fairly,  by a quick spring as the swallow touched the water almost at his  nose, near one of his numerous lurking places. Still it puzzled me a  good deal till one early morning, when I saw him in broad daylight do  a much more difficult thing than snapping up a swallow.    I was coming down the game path to the shore when a bird, a tree  sparrow I thought, flew to the ground just ahead of me, and hopped to  the water to drink. I watched him a moment curiously, then with  intense interest as I saw a ripple steal out of the lily pads towards  him. The ripple was Chigwooltz.    The sparrow had finished drinking and was absorbed in a morning bath.  Chigwooltz stole nearer and nearer, sinking himself till only his eyes  showed above water. The ripple that flowed away on either side was  gentle as that of a floating leaf. Then, just as the bird had sipped  and lifted its head for a last swallow, Chigwooltz hurled himself out  of water. One snap of his big mouth, and the sparrow was done for.    An hour later, when I came down to my canoe, he was sitting low on the  lily pads, winking sleepily now and then, with eight little sparrow's  toes curling over the rim of his under lip, like a hornpout's  whiskers.          VI. CLOUD WINGS THE EAGLE.    [Illustration: Old Whitehead]      \"Here he is again! here's Old Whitehead, robbing the fish-hawk.\"    I started up from the little _commoosie_ beyond the fire, at Gillie's  excited cry, and ran to join him on the shore. A glance out over  Caribou Point to the big bay, where innumerable whitefish were  shoaling, showed me another chapter in a long but always interesting  story. Ismaquehs, the fish-hawk, had risen from the lake with a big  fish, and was doing his best to get away to his nest, where his young  ones were clamoring. Over him soared the eagle, still as fate and as  sure, now dropping to flap a wing in Ismaquehs' face, now touching him  with his great talons gently, as if to say, \"Do you feel that,  Ismaquehs? If I grip once 't will be the end of you and your fish  together. And what will the little ones do then, up in the nest on  the old pine? Better drop him peacefully; you can catch  another.--_Drop him_! I say.\"    [Illustration: Ismaquehs]    Up to that moment the eagle had merely bothered the big hawk's flight,  with a gentle reminder now and then that he meant no harm, but wanted  the fish which he could not catch himself. Now there was a change, a  flash of the king's temper. With a roar of wings he whirled round the  hawk like a tempest, bringing up short and fierce, squarely in his  line of flight. There he poised on dark broad wings, his yellow eyes  glaring fiercely into the shrinking soul of Ismaquehs, his talons  drawn hard back for a deadly strike. And Simmo the Indian, who had run  down to join me, muttered: \"Cheplahgan mad now. Ismaquehs find-um out  in a minute.\"    But Ismaquehs knew just when to stop. With a cry of rage he dropped,  or rather threw, his fish, hoping it would strike the water and be  lost. On the instant the eagle wheeled out of the way and bent his  head sharply. I had seen him fold wings and drop before, and had held  my breath at the speed. But dropping was of no use now, for the fish  fell faster. Instead he swooped downward, adding to the weight of his  fall the push of his strong wings, glancing down like a bolt to catch  the fish ere it struck the water, and rising again in a great  curve--up and away steadily, evenly as the king should fly, to his  own little ones far away on the mountain.    Weeks before, I had had my introduction to Old Whitehead, as Gillie  called him, on the Madawaska. We were pushing up river on our way to  the wilderness, when a great outcry and the _bang-bang_ of a gun  sounded just ahead. Dashing round a wooded bend, we came upon a man  with a smoking gun, a boy up to his middle in the river, trying to get  across, and, on the other side, a black sheep running about _baaing_  at every jump.    \"He's taken the lamb; he's taken the lamb!\" shouted the boy. Following  the direction of his pointing finger, I saw Old Whitehead, a splendid  bird, rising heavily above the tree-tops across the clearing. Reaching  back almost instinctively, I clutched the heavy rifle which Gillie put  into my hand and jumped out of the canoe; for with a rifle one wants  steady footing. It was a long shot, but not so very difficult; Old  Whitehead had got his bearings and was moving steadily, straight away.  A second after the report of the rifle, we saw him hitch and swerve in  the air; then two white quills came floating down, and as he turned we  saw the break in his broad white tail. And that was the mark that we  knew him by ever afterwards.    That was nearly eighty miles by canoe from where we now stood, though  scarcely ten in a straight line over the"]]]
