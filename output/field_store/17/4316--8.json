As he has been in the Congo  for more than twenty years, he knows the country well and thus speaks  with authority. He thinks the system of Government excellent, but that  it is administered better in the Lower than the Upper Congo, because  there are not enough officials in the latter. He is convinced the  population has greatly decreased on the riverside of the Bangala  District, and attributes it chiefly to Sleeping Sickness for he cannot  say if emigration to the French Congo has been extensive or not. No case  of ill-treatment of natives has come to his notice during the last three  years, but he thinks the State does not give them enough work to do. He  has seen natives without hands, but does not believe that any atrocities  have occurred for many years. Generally speaking, he thinks it would be  better if the State acquired all the property of the Companies. Although  he does not know of any definite cases of ill-treatment, he has heard  reports and thinks there is \"no smoke without fire.\" However, he is  quite prepared to agree that a very little fire in the Congo makes a  great deal of smoke. Altogether, Mr. Grenfell spoke very calmly, and is  evidently not carried away by emotionalism or strong prejudice against  the State.    At Coquilhatville, as elsewhere in the State, the prisoners are given  useful work to do. Near by a party were digging a hole by the roadway.  They were chained together but the chain was so long that it did not  hamper their movements. Two policemen were on guard, but the whole gang  were evidently taking matters very easily.    In the evening we dine with the Commissaire and a party of sixteen or  eighteen, including many of our fellow travellers, Mr. Grenfell and Dr.  Button, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, who is here  studying the Sleeping Sickness. Everyone we meet who has travelled in  other countries and also visited the Congo, is astonished at the  wonderful development of the place. It is indeed becoming more and more  apparent that the State has gone ahead very fast and that the stress has  been great, both for Europeans and natives. Probably, now the machine is  fairly set rolling, it will proceed more steadily in the future.    Next day we decide to leave the _Flandre_ and stay for a week or so at  Coquilhatville. Commandant Ankstroem, the Adjoint Superieur to the  Commissaire, kindly lends us his house and we at once move in, glad to  leave the mosquitoes of the river and to sleep in a room once more.  Everything in the house and garden is scrupulously clean and tidy,  characteristics which I may add were found in nearly every Post and  house in the whole country. The sanitary arrangements are the  perfection of simplicity. There are no drains, but simple receptables  which are emptied and cleaned every morning while carbolic acid is used  liberally. This admirable system is carried out in every Post, however  large or small, and I never once found it unobserved. The natives  themselves are also very cleanly in their habits, so that although the  heat is great and decomposition proceeds very rapidly, bad smells are  absolutely unknown. Near the residency is a well kept farm and the  mutton tasted particularly nice after the diet of goat on the steamer.    The effect of the climate on my digestion is curious. In Europe all  forms of starch and sugar give me indigestion and I have therefore to  avoid bread, potatoes, jam, sugar and kindred substances. Here however,  I have a craving for these things and never have indigestion. I mention  this personal trait, because many other travellers in the tropics have  often stated that they could march on rice and jam for days without  desiring meat of any kind. No doubt the system is working at, so to  speak, high pressure, but it is curious that a complete change in one's  idiosyncrasies should take place even in the first month.    On August 5th the _Flandre_ proceeds up the river, and we bid farewell  to our travelling companions, who seem to have become old friends in the  last six weeks. Everyone, is always most kind and courteous, and not  only gives every information, but also the benefit of his experience,  and thus affords much valuable assistance. The town of Coquilhatville  consists of rows of brick houses standing in their own gardens and  fronting on avenues. It may seem that one insists unnecessarily on the  fact that the houses are brick in all the towns, a fact which the  European would accept as a matter of course. The traveller however knows  that in most tropical countries, wood is usually employed instead, as  being easier to obtain and work. Indeed in the United States, the  country seats of even the very wealthy are generally constructed chiefly  of that substance. Bricks however, are by no means easily made in the  Congo, for in many places the soil is very sandy and it is therefore  difficult to make the brick bind. Again, lime is very scarce and all  manner of substances are used to make mortar. Among these the ant hills  are much in favour, for it has been observed that these structures which  are often thirty feet high and in proportion great in diameter, never  disintegrate in the heaviest rain. When dug out and mixed with sand  their substance makes an excellent mortar. Again, the shells of oysters,  which abound in some parts of the river are also used to make mortar  with good results. The roofs are thatched with palm leaves wherever  obtainable, and if well constructed are quite water tight. Glass windows  are not much used, for as much air as possible is desirable and the  verandahs are so broad that rain rarely enters. The openings are thus  closed only by shutters or by wire gauze to keep out the numerous  insects.    Living here is very expensive. The usual money is the mitako, but the  native likes salt and will sometimes take cloth if he fancies it. He is  however, very independent, and on one occasion a native refused 14/- in  cloth for a single duck. Fowls and eggs are about the same price as in  the West End of London, but the latter are very scarce. Fruit is  however, cheap, as it is abundant. Near the town is a large coffee and  cocoa plantation arranged in square fields, separated by avenues of  palms, which both form grateful shade and yield much palm oil. On each  field is a large board on which is painted the number of bushes. Papye,  coeur de boeuf, bananas and pineapples abound.    The system of work in every Post is exactly the same, so that a  description of it as witnessed in Coquilhatville would equally do for  every place in the Congo. At 5.30 a.m. reveille and at 6 a.m. roll call  of all the Europeans and native workers who then, led by a bugler, march  off to their respective duties. At 11.15 a.m. bugle call and all the  natives march to the river and bathe. At 11.30 a.m. bathing ceases and  they march off behind the bugler to dinner and rest. At 2.30 p.m. they  assemble again and at 5.30 p.m. finish for the day. The native thus  works eight hours and a half and rests in the hottest portion of the  day. The workers in the plantations are entirely volunteers and so do  not come under the 40 hours' rule, which is only applied to those who  live in the villages and are not in the State service. The women do the  light work in the plantations and thus fare much better, than when  forced to do all the work by their husbands, which happens in all the  villages. It is curious to see them brushing the roads with palm leaves.  Six or eight women walk abreast and push away the dust and dead leaves  which are then collected in baskets and thrown into the river.    As our house looks into the square where the Force Publique drill, we  witness the methods employed. At first the recruit is taught which is  right and which is left. _Droite_ and up goes the right hand, _gauche_  and the left follows. The native corporal, however, has corrupted these  words into _hi hoo_ so that, as is usual in military commands, no mere  civilian can possibly understand them. Afterwards when he comes to mount  guard and relieve sentries, the order _presentez armes!_ might be  anything from the sound.    The band practices also close at hand. First the cornet picks out some  air he has heard, note by note, and like a child who is learning the  piano, always goes back to the beginning of the piece when he strikes a  false note. After many trials the whole air is discovered. Then the  trombones and bass instruments put in the accompaniment also by  experiment, and in the end the result is really quite good for Africans  unlike Asiatics, take kindly to European music.    The method of moving heavy weights is necessarily very primitive, for,  with the exception of a few wheel-barrows, there are no vehicles of any  kind here. A huge tree trunk was carried into the square one day; pieces  of wood had been lashed across it about two feet apart throughout its  length. One or two men on each side of each piece then lifted it and the  whole eighty or hundred men marched the trunk along with ease at a jog  trot. It would indeed be impossible to use heavy trolleys in this part  of the Congo, for the roads are sandy and the wheels would at once sink  deeply into them.    A walk through the plantation, which extends over some square miles, is  very pleasant, as the palms spread their leaves across the avenues until  they nearly touch each other thus forming beautiful shady groves. Ferns  grow round the stems and the whole is extremely pretty and  cool-looking. Beyond the plantation is the cemetery for the whites. Each  grave is covered with bricks and has a wooden cross at the head on which  is inscribed the name and date of death. The age however, is omitted and  this is perhaps as well, for the Congo exacts a heavy toll of young  lives and new comers are often depressed already by the accounts of the  climate which have reached Europe."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#12)"],[1,"  in order that he and Elisha might pass over dryshod, or for Bodhidharma  to stand on a reed to cross the great Yangtzu River, or for innumerable  Immortals to sit on 'favourable clouds' to make their journeys through  space, he spoils myth--his child is stillborn or does not survive to  maturity. Though the growth of philosophy and decay of superstition  may be good for a nation, the process is certainly conducive to the  destruction of its myth and much of its poetry. The true mythologist  takes myth for myth, enters into its spirit, and enjoys it.    We may thus expect to find in the realm of Chinese mythology a large  number of little hills rather than a few great mountains, but the  little hills are very good ones after their kind; and the object of  this work is to present Chinese myth as it is, not as it might have  been had the universe been differently constituted. Nevertheless, if,  as we may rightly do, we judge of myth by the sentiments pervading  it and the ideals upheld and taught by it, we shall find that Chinese  myth must be ranked among the greatest.      Myth and Legend    The general principles considered above, while they explain the paucity  of myth in China, explain also the abundance of legend there. The six  hundred years during which the Mongols, Mings, and Manchus sat upon  the throne of China are barren of myth, but like all periods of the  Chinese national life are fertile in legend. And this chiefly for the  reason that myths are more general, national, divine, while legends are  more local, individual, human. And since, in China as elsewhere, the  lower classes are as a rule less educated and more superstitious than  the upper classes--have a certain amount of constructive imagination,  but not enough to be self-critical--legends, rejected or even ridiculed  by the scholarly class when their knowledge has become sufficiently  scientific, continue to be invented and believed in by the peasant and  the dweller in districts far from the madding crowd long after myth,  properly so called, has exhaled its last breath.        CHAPTER III    Cosmogony-p'an Ku and the Creation Myth      The Fashioner of the Universe    The most conspicuous figure in Chinese cosmogony is P'an Ku. He it was  who chiselled the universe out of Chaos. According to Chinese ideas,  he was the offspring of the original dual powers of Nature, the _yin_  and the _yang_ (to be considered presently), which, having in some  incomprehensible way produced him, set him the task of giving form  to Chaos and \"making the heavens and the earth.\"    Some accounts describe him as the actual creator of the universe--\"the  ancestor of Heaven and earth and all that live and move and have their  being.\" 'P'an' means 'the shell of an egg,' and 'Ku' 'to secure,'  'solid,' referring to P'an Ku being hatched from out of Chaos and  to his settling the arrangement of the causes to which his origin  was due. The characters themselves may, however, mean nothing more  than 'Researches into antiquity,' though some bolder translators  have assigned to them the significance if not the literal sense of  'aboriginal abyss,' or the Babylonian Tiamat, 'the Deep.'    P'an Ku is pictured as a man of dwarfish stature clothed in bearskin,  or merely in leaves or with an apron of leaves. He has two horns on  his head. In his right hand he holds a hammer and in his left a chisel  (sometimes these are reversed), the only implements he used in carrying  out his great task. Other pictures show him attended in his labours  by the four supernatural creatures--the unicorn, phoenix, tortoise,  and dragon; others again with the sun in one hand and the moon in the  other, some of the firstfruits of his stupendous labours. (The reason  for these being there will be apparent presently.) His task occupied  eighteen thousand years, during which he formed the sun, moon, and  stars, the heavens and the earth, himself increasing in stature day  by day, being daily six feet taller than the day before, until, his  labours ended, he died that his works might live. His head became the  mountains, his breath the wind and clouds, his voice the thunder,  his limbs the four quarters of the earth, his blood the rivers,  his flesh the soil, his beard the constellations, his skin and hair  the herbs and trees, his teeth, bones, and marrow the metals, rocks,  and precious stones, his sweat the rain, and the insects creeping  over his body human beings, who thus had a lowlier origin even than  the tears of Khepera in Egyptian cosmology. [3]    This account of P'an Ku and his achievements is of Taoist origin. The  Buddhists have given a somewhat different account of him, which is  a late adaptation from the Taoist myth, and must not be mistaken for  Buddhist cosmogony proper. [4]      The Sun and the Moon    In some of the pictures of P'an Ku he is represented, as already noted,  as holding the sun in one hand and the moon in the other. Sometimes  they are in the form of those bodies, sometimes in the classic  character. The legend says that when P'an Ku put things in order in  the lower world, he did not put these two luminaries in their proper  courses, so they retired into the Han Sea, and the people dwelt in  darkness. The Terrestrial Emperor sent an officer, Terrestrial Time,  with orders that they should come forth and take their places in  the heavens and give the world day and night. They refused to obey  the order. They were reported to Ju Lai; P'an Ku was called, and,  at the divine direction of Buddha, wrote the character for 'sun'  in his left hand, and that for 'moon' in his right hand; and went to  the Han Sea, and stretched forth his left hand and called the sun,  and then stretched forth his right hand and called the moon, at the  same time repeating a charm devoutly seven times; and they forthwith  ascended on high, and separated time into day and night. [5]    Other legends recount that P'an Ku had the head of a dragon and  the body of a serpent; and that by breathing he caused the wind,  by opening his eyes he created day, his voice made the thunder, etc.      P'an Ku and Ymer    Thus we have the heavens and the earth fashioned by this wonderful  being in eighteen thousand years. With regard to him we may adapt  the Scandinavian ballad:          It was Time's morning      When P'an Ku lived;      There was no sand, no sea,      Nor cooling billows;            Earth there was none,      No lofty Heaven;      No spot of living green;      Only a deep profound.      And it is interesting to note, in passing, the similarity between this  Chinese artificer of the universe and Ymer, the giant, who discharges  the same functions in Scandinavian mythology. Though P'an Ku did not  have the same kind of birth nor meet with the violent death of the  latter, the results as regards the origin of the universe seem to  have been pretty much the same. [6]      P'an Ku a Late Creation    But though the Chinese creation myth deals with primeval things it  does not itself belong to a primitive time. According to some writers  whose views are entitled to respect, it was invented during the fourth  century A.D. by the Taoist recluse, Magistrate Ko Hung, author of the  _Shen hsien chuan_ (_Biographies of the Gods_). The picturesque person  of P'an Ku is said to have been a concession to the popular dislike  of, or inability to comprehend, the abstract. He was conceived, some  Chinese writers say, because the philosophical explanations of the  Cosmos were too recondite for the ordinary mind to grasp. That he  did fulfil the purpose of furnishing the ordinary mind with a fairly  easily comprehensible picture of the creation may be admitted; but,  as will presently be seen, it is over-stating the case to say that he  was conceived with the set purpose of furnishing the ordinary mind with  a concrete solution or illustration of this great problem. There is  no evidence that P'an Ku had existed as a tradition before the time  when we meet with the written account of him; and, what is more,  there is no evidence that there existed any demand on the part of  the popular mind for any such solution or illustration. The ordinary  mind would seem to have been either indifferent to or satisfied  with the abstruse cosmogonical and cosmological theories of the  early sages for at least a thousand years. The cosmogonies of the _I  ching_, of Lao Tzu, Confucius (such as it was), Kuan Tzu, Mencius,  Chuang Tzu, were impersonal. P'an Ku and his myth must be regarded  rather as an accident than as a creation resulting from any sudden  flow of psychological forces or wind of discontent ruffling the  placid Chinese mind. If the Chinese brought with them from Babylon  or anywhere else the elements of a cosmogony, whether of a more or  less abstruse scientific nature or a personal mythological narrative,  it must have been subsequently forgotten or at least has not survived  in China. But for Ko Hung's eccentricity and his wish to experiment  with cinnabar from Cochin-China in order to find the elixir of life,  P'an Ku would probably never have been invented, and the Chinese mind  would have been content to go on ignoring the problem or would have  quietly acquiesced in the abstract philosophical explanations of the  learned which it did not understand. Chinese cosmogony would then  have consisted exclusively of the recondite impersonal metaphysics  which the Chinese mind had entertained or been fed on for the nine  hundred or more years preceding the invention of the P'an Ku myth.      Nue Kua Shih, the Repairer of the Heavens    It is true that there exist one or two other explanations of the  origin of things which introduce a personal creator. There is,  for instance, the legend--first mentioned by Lieh Tzu (to whom we  shall revert later)--which represents Nue Kua Shih (also called Nue  Wa and Nue Hsi), said to have been the sister and successor of Fu  Hsi, the mythical sovereign whose reign is"]]]
