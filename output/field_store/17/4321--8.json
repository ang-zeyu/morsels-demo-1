Once a year each of the four High School classes gave some sort of  entertainment. Readers of \"GRACE HARLOWE'S PLEBE YEAR\" will remember the  masquerade ball given by the sophomores, now juniors, and the active part  taken by Grace and her chums in that festivity.    The present sophomores had decided to make their ball a larger affair than  usual, and had sent out invitations to favored members of the other  classes. An equal number of boys had been invited from the boys' High  School, and the party promised to be one of the social events of Oakdale.    Mrs. Gray and a number of other prominent women of Oakdale, were to act as  patronesses. Mrs. Harlowe, usually a favorite chaperon with Grace's crowd,  had been ignored for the first time, and Grace was cut to the quick over  it. As for Grace herself, she had not been appointed to a single  committee. Prominent heretofore in every school enterprise, it was galling  to the high-spirited girl to be deliberately left out of the preparations.  Nora had been asked to help receive and Jessica had been appointed to the  refreshment committee, but on finding that Grace was being snubbed, both  had coldly declined to serve in either capacity.    The four chums held more than one anxious discussion as to the  advisability of even attending the ball.    \"I think we ought to go, just to show those girls that we are impervious  to their petty insults,\" declared Grace. \"We have as much right there as  any one else, and I am sure the boys we know will dance with us whether  the rest of the girls like it or not. Besides, Mrs. Gray will be there,  and she will expect to see us. She doesn't know anything about this  trouble, and I don't want her to know. It would only grieve her. She is so  fond of Anne. By all means we must go to the ball. Wear your prettiest  gowns and act as though nothing had happened.\"    That night, the four young girls, in their party finery, sat waiting in  the Harlowe's drawing room for their escorts--David, Hippy and Reddy. Anne  wore the pink crepe de chine which had done duty at Mrs. Gray's house  party the previous winter. Grace wore an exquisite gown of pale blue silk  made in a simple, girlish fashion that set her off to perfection. Nora was  gowned in lavender and wore a corsage bouquet of violets that had  mysteriously arrived that afternoon, and that everyone present suspected  Hippy of sending. Jessica's gown was of white organdie, trimmed with tiny  butterfly medallions and valenciennes lace.    In spite of the possibility that she and Anne might be the subject of  unpleasant comment, Grace made up her mind to enjoy herself. She was fond  of dancing, and knew that she would have plenty of invitations to do so.  David would look after Anne, who was not yet proficient enough in dancing  to venture to try it in public.    \"If only Miriam and Julia Crosby behave themselves!\" she thought, \"for, of  course, Julia will be there. Miriam will see that she gets an invitation.\"    Grace thrilled with pride as she entered the gymnasium. How beautifully it  had been decorated and how well everything looked. She was so sorry that  the girls had seen fit to leave her out of it all. Then she remembered her  resolution to forget all differences and just have a good time.    Miriam, gowned in apricot messaline trimmed with silver, was in the  receiving line with half a dozen other sophomores. Grace and her party  would be obliged to exchange civilities with the enemy. She wondered what  Miriam would do. David solved this problem for her by taking charge of the  situation. Walking straight up to Miriam, he said a few words to her in a  low tone. She flushed slightly, looked a trifle defiant then greeted the  girls coldly, but with civility. The other sophomores followed her  example, but Grace breathed a sigh of relief as they walked over to where  Mrs. Gray, in a wonderful black satin gown, sat among the patronesses.    \"My dear children, I am so glad to see all of you!\" exclaimed the  sprightly old lady. \"How fine all my girls look. You are like a bouquet of  flowers. Grace is a bluebell, Anne is a dear little clove pink, Nora is a  whole bunch of violets and Jessica looks like a white narcissus.\"    \"Where do we come in?\" asked David, smiling at Mrs. Gray's pretty  comparison.    \"Allow me to answer that question,\" said Hippy. \"You are like the tall and  graceful burdock. Reddy resembles the common, but much-admired sheep  sorrel, while I am like that tender little flower, the forget-me-not.  Having once seen me, is it possible to forget me!\" He struck an attitude  and looked languishingly at Nora.    \"I'll forget you forever if you look at me like that,\" threatened Nora.    \"Never again,\" said Hippy hastily. \"Bear witness, all of you, that my  expression has changed.\"    Just then the first notes of the waltz \"Amoreuse\" rang out, and the  gymnasium floor was soon filled with High School boys and girls dressed in  their best party attire. The dances followed each other in rapid  succession until supper was announced. This was served at small tables by  the town caterer.    Mrs. Gray and her adopted children occupied two tables near together and  had a merry time. Many curious glances were cast in their direction by the  other members of the sophomore class.    Some of the girls wondered whether it was a good thing to cut Anne  Pierson's acquaintance. She was certainly a friend of Mrs. Gray, and Mrs.  Gray was one of the most influential women in Oakdale. Frances Fuller, a  worldly-minded sophomore, dared to intimate as much to Miriam Nesbit, who  replied loftily:    \"If Mrs. Gray knew as much about Miss Pierson as we do, she would probably  not care for her any longer.\"    \"It's a pity some one doesn't tell her,\" said Julia Crosby, ever ready for  mischief.    \"Oh, some one will have the courage yet,\" answered Miriam, \"and when she  does, that will end everything as far as Miss Pierson is concerned. Mrs.  Gray can't endure anything dishonorable.\"    Just then a young man claimed Miriam for the two-step about to begin, and  Julia wandered off, leaving Frances to digest what had been said. The more  the latter thought about it, the more she felt that Mrs. Gray ought to be  warned against Anne. She decided that she had the courage; that it was  her duty to do so.    Without hesitating, she blundered over to where Mrs. Gray sat for the  moment.    \"Mrs. Gray,\" Frances began, \"I want to tell you something which I think  you ought to know.\"    \"And what is that, my dear?\" asked the old lady courteously, trying vainly  to remember the girl's face.    \"Why, about Miss Pierson's true character,\" replied the girl.    \"Miss Pierson's true character?\" repeated Mrs. Gray. \"I don't understand  what you mean.\"    \"That she is dishonorable and treacherous. She betrayed the sophomore  basketball signals to the juniors, and then denied it, when her class had  positive proof against her. Besides, her father is a disreputable actor,  and she was an actress before she came here. We thought if you knew the  truth you wouldn't uphold any such person.\" Frances paused. She thought  she had made an impression upon her listener.    Mrs. Gray sat silent. She was too deeply incensed to trust herself to  speak. Frances looked complacent. She evidently hoped to be commended for  her plain speaking. Then Mrs. Gray found her voice.    \"Young woman,\" she said, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself. What can  you hope to gain by saying unkind things about a nice, gentle, little girl  who is in every respect worthy of all the love and regard that can be  given her? I do not know what you can be thinking of to speak so  slightingly of one of your classmates, and I am sorry to be obliged to  remind you that it is the height of ill breeding to abuse a person to his  or her friends.\"    With these words, Mrs. Gray turned her back squarely upon the dazed girl,  who slowly arose, and without looking at Mrs. Gray, walked dejectedly  across the room. But Miriam Nesbit lost one supporter from that minute on.    \"Hateful things,\" said the mortified Frances, looking towards Julia and  Miriam. \"I believe they are more to blame than Miss Pierson ever thought  of being.\"    When Grace paused at Mrs. Gray's side after the two-step, she saw plainly  that the old lady was much agitated.    \"Grace,\" she said quickly, \"what is all this nonsense about Anne?\"    \"O Mrs. Gray,\" cried Grace. \"Who could have been so unkind as to tell you?  We didn't want you to know. It is all so foolish.\"    \"But I want to know,\" said the old lady positively. \"Anne is so very dear  to me, and I can't allow these hare-brained girls to make damaging  statements about her. Tell me at once, Grace.\"    Grace reluctantly gave a brief account of her recent disagreement with her  class and the unpleasantness to which Anne had been subjected.    \"What does ail Miriam Nesbit? She used to be such a nice child!\" exclaimed  Mrs. Gray. \"Really, Grace, I feel that I ought to go straight to Miss  Thompson with this.\"    Grace's heart sank. That was just what she did not want Mrs. Gray to do.    \"Dear Mrs. Gray,\" she said, patting the old lady's hand, \"it is better for  us to fight it out by ourselves. If Miss Thompson knew all that had  happened, she would forbid basketball for the rest of the season. She is  awfully opposed to anything of that kind, and would champion Anne's cause  to the end, but Anne would rather let matters stand the way they are, than  lose us our basketball privilege. You see, the juniors have won the first  game, and if basketball were stopped now we would have no chance to make  up our lost ground. I firmly believe that all will come right in the end,  and I think the girls will get tired of their grudge and gradually drop  it. Of course it hurts to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15352"],[0,"Venereal Diseases in New Zealand (1922) (#12)"],[1," law, will be that in scores of cases  medical men will not be called in to attend people suffering from  infectious diseases ... I admit the difficulty of the position, but I am  anxious that no measure should pass into law which will induce the  public to keep these diseases more secret than they have been in the  past, with the risk of adding to the spreading of them. We must be very  cautious not to do anything which will prevent the public from placing  full and implicit confidence in their medical man. I can quite conceive  it to be possible that, if an outbreak of infectious disease occurs in a  populous part of London, the people may, in order to prevent exposure,  refuse to allow a medical man to come in, and in such cases we shall  have tenfold more difficulty than at present. Therefore, while I am  anxious to promote the notification of disease, I do not want the  Government to promote rebellion on the part of the public.\"    Needless to say, these gloomy anticipations have not been realized.  Probably the more enlightened generations to succeed us will wonder how  there could ever have been any opposition to the notification of  venereal disease, just as we to-day read Sir W. Foster's words and  marvel that any person of intelligence could have committed himself to  such statements.    Notification of infectious diseases and isolation of patients suffering  from such diseases have for many years been compulsory. Isolation, when  spoken of by opponents to a similar measure for venereal diseases, is  opprobriously described as \"compulsory detention.\" For twenty years it  has been the law in New Zealand that an authorized medical practitioner  may examine any person suspected to be suffering from any infectious  diseases (save venereal diseases), and the Medical Officer of Health  may, if he deems it expedient in the interests of the public health,  compel the removal to a hospital of any person so suffering. This  long-established procedure as referable to venereal diseases is by  antagonists termed \"compulsory examination\" and \"compulsory removal.\"    It is contended by some witnesses that notification will drive these  diseases underground; but syphilis and gonorrhoea for generations past  have been underground.    Under the present system numbers of unfortunate persons either delay  calling in medical assistance until the case has become almost desperate  so far as the patient is concerned, or they resort to unqualified  persons, with the result that in most cases what was in the first  instance a simple attack, capable of treatment, results in serious  complications most difficult to deal with. In either case the patient  may be communicating diseases to others, and should this come to the  knowledge of the Health Department it has no effective means of checking  him--no power to warn those who are being endangered by his criminal  neglect.    The Committee think there is some force in the argument that  notification by name, in the first instance, as in the case of ordinary  infectious diseases, would tend to discourage some from coming forward  for medical treatment. They recommend, therefore, the adoption of what  is known as the system of conditional notification embodied in the West  Australia Act. Under this plan the cases are notified by the doctor to  the Health Department by number or symbol only. The name is not sent in  unless the patient discontinues treatment before he is free from  infection and refuses either to go to a clinic or to another doctor. In  cases of those who \"play the game,\" the name of the patient is kept  confidential, and does not pass beyond the medical man attending him. It  is only in cases of those who contumaciously refuse to do what is  necessary for their own safety and the safety of others that the name is  sent to the Health Department, in order that appropriate steps may be  taken in the interests of public health. Even then the name is given  only to officers who are pledged to keep it confidential.    Following are the clauses in suggestions for a Bill, drawn up by the  Health Department, which in the opinion of the Committee should in  substance be adopted:---         \"(1.) Every medical practitioner shall forthwith give notice to the       Director-General of Health, in the prescribed form, upon becoming       aware that any person attended or treated by him is suffering from       any venereal disease in a communicable form. The notice shall state       the age and sex and occupation of the patient and the nature of the       disease, but shall omit the patient's name and address.         \"(2.) Every medical practitioner, other than the medical officer in       charge of a public hospital or of a clinic established by direction       of the Minister of Health, shall be paid for each such notification       a fee to be prescribed by regulation.         \"(3.) The provisions of subsection (1) hereof shall apply in the       case of a child under the age of sixteen years who is suffering       from congenital syphilis.         \"(4.) Whenever a patient has changed his medical adviser, in       accordance with subsection (2) hereof, the medical practitioner       under whose care the patient has placed himself shall notify the       Director-General of Health in accordance with subsection (1)       hereof, and shall include in such notice the name and address of       the previous medical adviser.\"    Without some such system of preliminary notification no adequate  statistics can be collected as to the prevalence of venereal diseases in  New Zealand, and no conclusion could be arrived at in the future as to  the effect of the whole or any part of the programme for combating these  scourges. Again, without such notification, and the attachment thereto  of some method of ensuring that the patient is made definitely  acquainted with his condition, it is practically impossible to enforce  the provisions of section 8 of the Social Hygiene Act for the crime of  \"knowingly\" infecting any other person.    Here the Committee would refer to case 2 quoted above. Of what use is it  to provide free clinics if those who make use of them are permitted, as  soon as the urgent symptoms are relieved, to disseminate disease  broadcast, widening the circle of infection? Again, where is our  humanity if no step is to be taken to try to prevent a syphilitic child  being born to the man in case 1?    A very valuable result of anonymous notification would be the  possibility afforded of observing any unusual \"flare-up\" or succession  of cases, especially in country districts and small towns. Study of case  4 will show the great value it would have been to have a record of an  unusual increase of syphilis in that township, giving an opportunity for  prompt investigation by the Medical Officer of Health for the district.    (B.) _Compulsory Examination and Treatment._    This question obviously presents more difficulty than that of  notification, but it is clear that unless some means are provided of  bringing under treatment and, if necessary, isolating persons who are  suffering from highly contagious diseases, and who will not avail  themselves of medical treatment although this is provided free of cost  by the State, and who are knowingly or recklessly communicating the  disease to others, it will be impossible to keep in check this terrible  scourge. Without such provision any abandoned woman, as in case 4, or  any male libertine, may continue to sow disease broadcast without any  power to stop them. Failing some such measure, table articles and food  may continue to be smeared by hands soiled with syphilitic material, as  in case 1; section 6 of the Social Hygiene Act remains mere useless  verbiage, and the infecting of innocents, as in case 3, may continue  unchecked.    Legislation dealing with this subject needs to be carefully framed with  suitable safeguards, but the Committee think that an amendment of the  Social Hygiene Act on the lines proposed by the Department of Health  should be adopted. These provisions are:--         (1.) That whenever the Director-General of Health has reason to       believe that any person is suffering from venereal disease, and has       infected or is liable to infect other persons, he may give notice       in writing to such person directing him to consult a medical       practitioner, and to produce within a time specified in the notice       a certificate from such medical practitioner to the satisfaction of       the Director-General of Health that such person is or is not       suffering from venereal disease.         (2.) Should the person not comply with this request, the       Director-General of Health may obtain a warrant from a Magistrate       ordering such person to undergo examination to prove the existence,       or non-existence, of venereal disease.         (3.) Making it possible for a Magistrate, on the application of the       Director-General of Health, to order the detention in a hospital or       other approved place of a person who is likely to be a danger to       other persons until that person is cured of venereal disease.    These provisions are applicable equally to both sexes, and the Committee  see no reason to fear that the law would not be carefully and  impartially administered. If it should appear that more women than men  came under the operation of the law this result would be due to the fact  that, as disclosed in the evidence, a much larger proportion of women  than men fail to seek treatment, and of those treated a much larger  proportion of women fail to continue treatment until no longer  infectious.    It is hardly conceivable that a responsible officer, such as the  Director-General of Health, would take action under these provisions  unless he had strong reason to believe that such action was justified.  But, even if he makes a mistake or is misinformed, the worst that can  happen to an"]]]
