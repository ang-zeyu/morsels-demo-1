It is a truth than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],[0,"My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#12)"],[1,"es' gifts were in the meantime fulfilled;  for the princess was so beautiful, and well-behaved, and amiable, and  wise, that everyone who knew her loved her. Now it happened that on  the very day she was fifteen years old the king and queen were not  at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved about by  herself, and poked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last she  came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending  with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she  turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning  away very busily.    \"Why, how now, good mother,\" said the princess, \"what are you doing  there?\"    \"Spinning,\" said the old lady, and nodded her head.    \"How prettily that little thing turns round!\" said the princess, and  took the spindle and began to spin. But scarcely had she touched it  before the prophecy was fulfilled, and she fell down, as if lifeless,  on the ground.    However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and  the king and queen, who just then came home, and all their court, fell  asleep too, and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the  court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the flies on the walls. Even  the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; and the  meat that was roasting stood still; and the cook, who was at that  moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the  ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep;  and so everything stood still, and slept soundly.    [Illustration]    A large hedge of thorns soon grew around the palace, and every year it  became higher and thicker, till at last the whole place was surrounded  and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen.  But there went a report, through all the land, of the beautiful  sleeping Briar Rose (for so was the king's daughter called) so that  from time to time several kings' sons came, and tried to break through  the thicket into the palace. This they could never do; for the thorns  and bushes laid hold of them as it were with hands, and there they  stuck fast and died miserably.    [Illustration: \"ALL WAS SO QUIET THAT HE COULD HEAR EVERY BREATH HE  DREW.\"]    After many years came yet another king's son into that land, and  an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns, and how a  beautiful palace stood behind it, in which was a wondrous princess,  called Briar Rose, asleep with all her court. He told, too, how he had  heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had  tried to break through the thicket, but had stuck fast and died.    Then the young prince said, \"All this shall not frighten me; I will  go and see Briar Rose.\" The old man tried to dissuade him, but he  persisted in going.    Now that very day were the hundred years completed; and as the prince  came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs,  through which he passed with ease, and they closed after him, as firm  as ever. Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court  lay the dogs asleep, and the horses in the stables, and on the roof  sat the pigeons fast asleep with their heads under their wings; and  when he came into the palace, the flies slept on the walls, and the  cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand as if she would beat  the boy, and the maid with her pail in her hand was going a-milking.    Then he went on still further, and all was so quiet that he could hear  every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower and opened  the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was, and there she lay  fast asleep, and looked so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes  away, and he stooped down and gave her a kiss. But the moment he  kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him. For the  spell was broken.    Then they went out together, and presently the king and queen also  awoke, and all the court, and they gazed on each other with great  wonder. And the horses got up and shook themselves, and the dogs  jumped about and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their  wings, and looked around and flew into the fields; the flies on the  walls buzzed; the fire in the kitchen blazed up and cooked the dinner,  and the roast meat turned round again; the cook gave the boy the box  on his ear so that he cried out, and the maid went to milk the cows.  And then was the wedding of the prince and Briar Rose celebrated, and  they lived happily together all their lives long.

Tennyson]            PRINCE CHERI      There was once a king who was such an honourable man that his subjects  called him \"The Good King.\"    One day while he was out hunting, a little rabbit that his dogs were  about to kill, threw itself into his arms. The King caressed the  little creature, and said:    \"As you have put yourself under my protection nobody shall harm you,\"  and he carried the rabbit to his palace, and ordered a pretty little  hutch to be made for it.    That night when he was alone in his room, there appeared a lovely  lady. She wore a robe as white as snow, and a wreath of white roses on  her head. She addressed him thus:    \"I am the Fairy Candide; I wished to see if you were as good as  everybody declares you are, and for this reason I changed myself into  the little rabbit, and ran to you in my distress, for I know that  those who have pity for dumb creatures have still more pity for  mankind. I have come to thank you for what you did and to say that I  shall always be your friend, and will grant any request you would now  like to make.\"    [Illustration]    \"Madam,\" replied the King, \"I have one only son whom I love devotedly;  he is named Prince Cheri; if you have any good will for me, be a  friend to my son.\"    [Illustration]    \"Willingly,\" responded the Fairy, \"I will make your son the most  handsome prince in the world, or the richest, or the most powerful;  choose which you will for him.\"    \"I desire none of these things,\" replied the King, \"but I shall be  very much obliged if you will make him the best of all princes, for  what good would it do to him to be handsome, rich, or powerful if he  were wicked? You know he would be unhappy, for it is only goodness  which brings content.\"    \"You are right,\" answered the Fairy, \"but that I cannot do; Prince  Cheri must himself strive to become good. All that I can promise is  that I will give him good advice, and punish him for his faults, if he  will not himself correct them.\"    And with this the father had to rest content.    Not long afterwards the good King died, and two days later the Fairy  appeared to Prince Cheri.    \"I promised your father to be your friend,\" she told him; \"here is a  little gold ring, take care of it, for it is worth more than diamonds.  Every time that you are about to do any wrong action it will prick  you. If, in spite of the pricks, you continue your bad actions, you  will lose my friendship and I shall become your enemy.\"    Saying this the Fairy vanished, leaving the Prince very much  astonished.    For some time Cheri behaved so well that the ring did not prick  at all, but one day when he returned from the chase, having caught  nothing, he felt so ill-humoured, that when his dog Bibi came fawning  upon him, he kicked the poor, faithful creature from him. At that  moment the ring pricked like a pin running into his finger.    \"What is this?\" he exclaimed: \"the Fairy must be mocking me, surely  I've done no great harm in kicking an animal that annoyed me. What's  the use of being ruler of a great empire if I may not treat my dog as  I will?\"    \"I am not mocking you,\" he heard in reply to his thoughts; \"you have  been bad tempered, and you have behaved unkindly to a poor animal who  did not deserve such treatment. I know you are higher than a dog, but  the advantage of being ruler of a great empire is not in doing all the  harm one wishes, but in doing all the good one can.\"    Cheri promised to be better, but he did not keep his word, and so the  ring often pricked him, sometimes until his finger bled, and at last,  in anger, he threw it away.    Now he thought he would be truly happy, and he gave way to any foolish  fancies and wrong wishes that came into his head, until he really  became very wicked and was disliked by everyone.    One day when he was out walking he saw a girl named Zelie, who was so  beautiful that he resolved to marry her.    But Zelie was as good as she was beautiful, and said to him:    \"Sir, I am only a shepherdess and have no fortune, but, in spite of  that, I will never marry you, for although I should be a Queen, and  you are handsome and rich, your evil behaviour would make me hate  you.\"    Upon this, Cheri flew into a passion, and ordered his officers to  carry Zelie to the Palace, but she was not used unkindly there, for  the Prince loved her.    However, after a while, urged by his foster-brother, a bad man who  encouraged Cheri in his wickedness, the young man rushed in a rage to  the room in which Zelie was confined, determined that, if she still  refused to marry him, the very next day she should be sold as a slave.    Great was his surprise, on entering the apartment, to find the captive  had disappeared, for he carried the key of the door in his pocket.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  ZELIE AND THE FAIRY CANDIDE \"PRINCE CHERI\"]    Amongst those at the Royal Court was a Councillor named Suliman, a man  of a noble mind, who had often dared to tell the Prince of his faults,  and had at first been thanked for this, but later on Cheri grew angry "]]]
