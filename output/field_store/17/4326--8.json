The Daily Mail says Mr. Thrasher was bound for Secondee, West Africa.  Reference to the form which has to be filled out to satisfy the Board of  Trade and customs requirements by every passenger embarking at a British  port before tickets will be issued shows that Mr. Thrasher was a citizen  of the United States. Here are the particulars:    Name, Leon Chester Thrasher; age, last birthday, 31; single; sex, male;  profession, engineer; country of residence for last twelve months, Gold  Coast Colony, West Africa; country of intended residence for next twelve  months, the same; country of which citizen or subject, United States of  America; present address, 29 Cartwright Gardens, St. Pancras, W.C.    When Mr. Thrasher went on board the Falaba he produced an American  passport.    _The British Official Press Bureau on April 8 issued the following  report on the destruction of the Falaba:_    It is not true that sufficient time was given the passengers and the  crew of this vessel to escape. The German submarine closed in on the  Falaba, ascertained her name, signaled her to stop, and gave those on  board five minutes to take to the boats. It would have been nothing  short of a miracle if all the passengers and crew of a big liner had  been able to take to their boats within the time allotted.    While some of the boats were still on their davits the submarine fired a  torpedo at short range. This action made it absolutely certain that  there must be great loss of life and it must have been committed  knowingly with the intention of producing that result.    The conduct of all on board the Falaba appears to have been excellent.  There was no avoidable delay in getting out the boats. To accuse the  Falaba's crew of negligence under the circumstances could not easily be  paralleled.      THE GERMAN DEFENSE.    [By The Associated Press.]    _BERLIN, April 13, (via Amsterdam to London, April 14.)--A semi-official  account of the sinking of the British steamer Falaba by a German  submarine on March 28 was made public here today. It follows:_    On receiving the signal \"Stop, or I fire,\" the Falaba steamed off and  sent up rocket signals to summon help, and was only brought to a  standstill after a chase of a quarter of an hour.    Despite the danger of an attack from the steamer or from other vessels  hurrying up, the submarine did not immediately fire, but signaled that  the steamer must be abandoned within ten minutes. The men of the Falaba  quickly entered the boats, although the launching took place in an  unseamanlike manner. They failed to give assistance, which was possible,  to passengers struggling in the water.    From the time of the order to leave the ship until the torpedo was  discharged not ten but twenty-three minutes elapsed, prior to which  occurred the chase of the steamer, during which period time might have  been used to get the boats ready.    The torpedo was fired only when the approach of suspicious-looking  vessels, from which an attack was to be expected, compelled the  commander of the submarine to take quick action. When the torpedo was  discharged nobody was seen on board the ship except the Captain, who  bravely stuck to his post.    Afterward some persons became visible who were busy about a boat.    Of the crew of the submarine, the only ones on deck were those serving  the cannon or those necessary for signaling. It was impossible for them  to engage in rescue work, because the submarine could not take on  passengers.    Every word is superfluous in defending our men against malignant  accusations. At the judicial proceedings in England no witness dared  raise accusations. It is untrue that at any time the submarine displayed  the English flag. The submarine throughout the affair showed as much  consideration for the Falaba as was compatible with safety.      COMMANDER SCHMITZ'S STORY.    [From The New York Times, May 6, 1915.]    _J.J. Ryan, the American cotton broker who went to Germany on March 30  and sold 28,000 bales of cotton he had shipped to Bremen and Hamburg,  returned yesterday on the Cunard liner Carpathia very well satisfied  with the results of his trip. He said:_    While I was in Bremen I met Commander Schmitz of the German submarine  U-28, which sank the British African liner Falaba off the English coast  on March 28. He told me that he regretted having been compelled to  torpedo the vessel, as she had passengers on board. In explanation, he  said:    \"I warned the Captain of the Falaba to dismantle his wireless apparatus  and gave him ten minutes in which to do it and get his passengers off.  Instead of acting upon my demand he continued to send messages out to  torpedo destroyers that were less than twenty miles away, to come as  quickly as possible to his assistance.    \"At the expiration of the ten minutes I gave him a second warning about  dismantling his wireless apparatus and waited twenty minutes, and then I  torpedoed the ship, as the destroyers were getting close up and I knew  they would go to the rescue of the passengers and crew.\"    I mentioned the fact to the commander that it had been reported by some  of the survivors of the liner that while the men and women were  struggling for their lives in the icy water his crew were standing on  the deck of the submarine laughing. He looked very gravely at me and  replied, \"That is not true, and is most cruelly unjust to my men. They  were crying, not laughing, when the boats were capsized and threw the  people into the water.\"      CASE OF THE CUSHING.    [Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]    _WASHINGTON, May 1.--Secretary Bryan today received from American  Minister Henry van Dyke at The Hague a report on the attack by German  aviators on the American steamship Cushing and said tonight that this  report would be immediately cabled to Ambassador Gerard at Berlin for  his information. Ambassador Gerard will bring the matter to the  attention of the German Government. The report from Minister van Dyke  was very brief, and read as follows:_    The American Consul at Rotterdam reports that the American steamship  Cushing, Captain Herland, with petroleum from New York to Rotterdam,  flying the American flag, was attacked by German aeroplanes near the  North Hinder Lightship, afternoon April 29. Three bombs dropped, one  struck ship, causing damage, but no life lost.    _The report of Captain Lars Larsen Herland, master of the American tank  steamer Cushing, made upon his arrival in Philadelphia, Penn., on May  19, 1915, is as follows:_    The airmen swept in narrow circles over the tanker, trying to get  directly over the funnel, with the idea, apparently, of dropping a bomb  into it and wrecking the engine room.    When attacked the Cushing was about twenty-five miles from Antwerp and  eight miles from the North Hinder Lightship. It was near 7 o'clock in  the evening, but the sun had barely touched the horizon, and there was  ample light for the pilot of the biplane to see the words, \"Cushing, New  York, United States of America,\" painted on each side of the vessel in  letters eight feet high, and to note the Stars and Stripes at the  masthead and the taffrail.    When the airship was first noted it was several thousand feet in the  air, but dropped as it approached the ship, and soon was only about 500  feet up. Suddenly it swooped down to about 300 feet above the Cushing.  Then there was a tremendous explosion, and a wave flooded the stern  deck. A second bomb missed the port quarter by a foot or so, and sent  another wave over the lower deck.    The biplane swung up into the wind, hung motionless for a second or so,  then came the third bomb, which just grazed the starboard rail and shot  into the sea.    The airship hung around for a few minutes, then headed toward the Dutch  coast. She was flying a white flag, with a black cross in the centre,  the pennant of the German air fleet.      CASE OF THE GULFLIGHT.    _Official confirmation of the attack on May 1, 1915, by a German  submarine on the American oil tank steamer Gulflight off the Scilly  Islands came to the State Department at Washington on May 3 in  dispatches from Joseph G. Stephens, the United States Consul at  Plymouth, England. Two members of the crew were drowned, the Captain  died of heart failure, and thirty-four members of the crew were saved.  Following is the sworn statement of Ralph E. Smith, late chief officer  and now master of the Gulflight, received from Ambassador Page and  published by the State Department at Washington on May 11:_    I am Ralph E. Smith, now master of the steamship Gulflight. At the  commencement of the voyage I was chief officer. The ship left port at  Port Arthur on the 10th day of April, 1915, about 4 P.M., laden with a  tank cargo of gasoline and wooden barrels of lubricating oil. The voyage  was uneventful.    When about half way across the Atlantic the wireless operator told me  there was a British cruiser in our vicinity and that he had heard  messages from this ship the whole time since leaving Port Arthur, but  she made no direct communication with or to our ship. From the sound of  the wireless messages given out by the British ship, she seemed to  maintain the same distance from us until about three days before we  reached the mouth of the English Channel.    On the first day of May, about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, we spoke two  British patrol vessels named Iago and Filey. We were then about  twenty-two miles west of the Bishop Lighthouse. The patrol vessels asked  where we were bound. After informing them we were bound for Rouen, they  ordered us to follow them to the Bishop. The Filey took up a position a  half mile distant on our port bow, the Iago off our starboard quarter  close to us. We steered as directed, and at about 12:22, the second  officer, being on watch, sighted a submarine on our port bow--slightly  on the port bow--st"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15483"],[0,"Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (#12)"],[1,"pronounced  the name of her husband, for in India no woman, high or low, ever  pronounces the name of her husband,--she would consider it  disrespectful towards him to do so; and it is often amusing to see  their embarrassment when asked the question by any European  gentleman. They look right and left for some one to relieve them from  the dilemma of appearing disrespectful either to the querist or to  their absent husbands--they perceive that he is unacquainted with  their duties on this point, and are afraid he will attribute their  silence to disrespect. They know that few European gentlemen are  acquainted with them; and when women go into our courts of justice,  or other places where they are liable to be asked the names of their  husbands, they commonly take one of their children or some other  relation with them to pronounce the words in their stead. When the  old lady named her husband, as she did with strong emphasis, and in a  very deliberate manner, every one present was satisfied that she had  resolved to die. 'I have', she continued, 'tasted largely of the  bounty of Government, having been maintained by it with all my large  family in ease and comfort upon our rent-free lands; and I feel  assured that my children will not be suffered to want; but with them  I have nothing more to do, our intercourse and communion here end. My  soul (_pran_) is with _Ummed Singh Upadhya_: and my ashes must here  mix with his.'      Again looking to the sun--'I see them together', said she, with a  tone and countenance that affected me a good deal, 'under the bridal  canopy!'--alluding to the ceremonies of marriage; and I am satisfied  that she at that moment really believed that she saw her own spirit  and that of her husband under the bridal canopy in paradise.    I tried to work upon her pride and her fears. I told her that it was  probable that the rent-free lands by which her family had been so  long supported might be resumed by the Government, as a mark of its  displeasure against the children for not dissuading her from the  sacrifice; that the temples over her ancestors upon the bank might be  levelled with the ground, in order to prevent their operating to  induce others to make similar sacrifices; and lastly, that not one  single brick or stone should ever mark the place where she died if  she persisted in her resolution. But, if she consented to live, a  splendid habitation should be built for her among these temples, a  handsome provision assigned for her support out of these rent-free  lands, her children should come daily to visit her, and I should  frequently do the same. She smiled, but held out her arm and said,  'My pulse has long ceased to beat, my spirit has departed, and I have  nothing left but a little _earth_, that I wish to mix with the ashes  of my husband. I shall suffer nothing in burning; and, if you wish  proof, order some fire, and you shall see this arm consumed without  giving me any pain'. I did not attempt to feel her pulse, but some of  my people did, and declared that it had ceased to be perceptible. At  this time every native present believed that she was incapable of  suffering pain; and her end confirmed them in their opinion.    Satisfied myself that it would be unavailing to attempt to save her  life, I sent for all the principal members of the family, and  consented that she should be suffered to burn herself if they would  enter into engagements that no other member of their family should  ever do the same. This they all agreed to, and the papers having been  drawn out in due form about midday, I sent down notice to the old  lady, who seemed extremely pleased and thankful. The ceremonies of  bathing were gone through before three [o'clock], while the wood and  other combustible materials for a strong fire were collected and put  into the pit. After bathing, she called for a 'pan' (betel leaf) and  ate it, then rose up, and with one arm on the shoulder of her eldest  son, and the other on that of her nephew, approached the fire. I had  sentries placed all round, and no other person was allowed to  approach within five paces. As she rose up fire was set to the pile,  and it was instantly in a blaze. The distance was about 150 yards.  She came on with a calm and cheerful countenance, stopped once, and,  casting her eyes upward, said, 'Why have they kept me five days from  thee, my husband?' On coming to the sentries her supporters stopped;  she walked once round the pit, paused a moment, and, while muttering  a prayer, threw some flowers into the fire. She then walked up  deliberately and steadily to the brink, stepped into the centre of  the flame, sat down, and leaning back in the midst as if reposing  upon a couch, was consumed without uttering a shriek or betraying one  sign of agony.    A few instruments of music had been provided, and they played, as  usual, as she approached the fire, not, as is commonly supposed, in  order to drown screams, but to prevent the last words of the victim  from being heard, as these are supposed to be prophetic, and might  become sources of pain or strife to the living.[6] It was not  expected that I should yield, and but few people had assembled to  witness the sacrifice, so that there was little or nothing in the  circumstances immediately around to stimulate her to any  extraordinary exertions; and I am persuaded that it was the desire of  again being united to her husband in the next world, and the entire  confidence that she would be so if she now burned herself, that alone  sustained her. From the morning he died (Tuesday) till Wednesday  evening she ate 'pans' or betel leaves, but nothing else; and from  Wednesday evening she ceased eating them. She drank no water from  Tuesday. She went into the fire with the same cloth about her that  she had worn in the bed of the river; but it was made wet from a  persuasion that even the shadow of any impure thing falling upon her  from going to the pile contaminates the woman unless counteracted by  the sheet moistened in the holy stream.    I must do the family the justice to say that they all exerted  themselves to dissuade the widow from her purpose, and had she lived  she would assuredly have been cherished and honoured as the first  female member of the whole house. There is no people in the world  among whom parents are more loved, honoured, and obeyed than among  the Hindoos; and the grandmother is always more honoured than the  mother. No queen upon her throne could ever have been approached with  more reverence by her subjects than was this old lady by all the  members of her family as she sat upon a naked rock in the bed of the  river, with only a red rag upon her head and a single-white sheet  over her shoulders.    Soon after the battle of Trafalgar I heard a young lady exclaim, 'I  could really wish to have had a brother killed in that action'. There  is no doubt that a family in which a suttee takes place feels a good  deal exalted in its own esteem and that of the community by the  sacrifice. The sister of the Raja of Riwa was one of four or five  wives who burned themselves with the remains of the Raja of Udaipur;  and nothing in the course of his life will ever be recollected by her  brother with so much of pride and pleasure, since the Udaipur Raja is  the head of the Rajput tribes.[7]    I asked the old lady when she had first resolved upon becoming a  suttee, and she told me that about thirteen years before, while  bathing in the river Nerbudda, near the spot where she then sat, with  many other females of the family, the resolution had fixed itself in  her mind as she looked at the splendid temples on the bank of the  river erected by the different branches of the family over the ashes  of her female relations who had at different times become suttees.  Two, I think, were over her aunts, and one over the mother of her  husband. They were very beautiful buildings, and had been erected at  great cost and kept in good repair. She told me that she had never  mentioned this her resolution to any one from that time, nor breathed  a syllable on the subject till she called out 'Sat, sat, sat',[8]  when her husband breathed his last with his head in her lap on the  bank of the Nerbudda, to which he had been taken when no hopes  remained of his surviving the fever of which he died.    Charles Harding, of the Bengal Civil Service, as magistrate of  Benares, in 1806 prevented the widow of a Brahman from being burned.  Twelve months after her husband's death she had been goaded by her  family into the expression of a wish to burn with some relic of her  husband, preserved for the purpose. The pile was raised to her at  Ramnagar,[9] some two miles above Benares, on the opposite side of  the river Ganges. She was not well secured upon the pile, and as soon  as she felt the fire she jumped off and plunged into the river. The  people all ran after her along the bank, but the current drove her  towards Benares, whence a police boat put off and took her in.    She was almost dead with the fright and the water, in which she had  been kept afloat by her clothes. She was taken to Harding; but the  whole city of Benares was in an uproar, at the rescue of a Brahman's  widow from the funeral pile, for such it had been considered, though  the man had been a year dead. Thousands surrounded his house, and his  court was filled with the principal men of the city, imploring him to  surrender the woman; and among the rest was the poor woman's father,  who declared that he could not support his daughter; and that she  had, therefore, better be burned, as her husband's family would no  longer receive her. The uproar was quite alarming to a young man, who  felt all the responsibility upon himself in such a city as[10]  Benares, with a population of three hundred thousand people,[11] so  prone to popular insurrections, or risings _en masse_ very like them.  He long argued the point of the time"]]]
