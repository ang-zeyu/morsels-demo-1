We immediately took it to the    goldsmith, who at once declared it the finest gold he had ever    seen, and offered to pay fifty florins an ounce for it.\" He then    describes various tests which were made to prove the purity of the    gold. \"Thus I have unfolded to you the whole story from beginning    to end. The gold I still retain in my possession, but I cannot    tell you what has become of the Artist Elias.\"          CHAPTER VI.    ALCHEMY AS AN EXPERIMENTAL ART.      A modern writer, Mr A.E. Waite, in his _Lives of the Alchemystical  Philosophers_, says: \"The physical theory of transmutation is based on  the composite character of the metals, on their generation in the  bowels of the earth, and on the existence in nature of a pure and  penetrating matter which applied to any substance exalts and perfects  it after its own kind.\" It must he admitted that the alchemists could  cite many instances of transmutations which seemed to lead to the  conclusion, that there is no difference of kind between the metals and  other substances such as water, acids, oils, resins, and wood. We are  able to-day to effect a vast number of transformations wherein one  substance is exchanged for another, or made to take the place of  another. We can give fairly satisfactory descriptions of these  changes; and, by comparing them one with another, we are able to  express their essential features in general terms which can be applied  to each particular instance. The alchemists had no searching knowledge  of what may be called the mechanism of such changes; they gave an  explanation of them which we must call incorrect, in the present state  of our knowledge. But, as Hoefer says in his _Histoire de la Chimie_,  \"to jeer at [the alchemical] theory is to commit at once an  anachronism and an injustice.... Unless the world should finish  to-morrow, no one can have the pretension to suppose that our  contemporaries have said the last word of science, and nothing will  remain for our descendants to discover, no errors for them to correct,  no theories for them to set straight.\"    [Illustration: FIG. VI. _See p. 90._]    [Illustration: FIG. VII. _See p. 90._]    [Illustration: FIG. VIII. _See p. 91._]    What kind of experimental evidence could an alchemist furnish in  support of his theory of transmutation? In answering this question, I  cannot do better than give a condensed rendering of certain pages in  Hoefer's _Histoire de la Chimie_.    The reader is supposed to be present at experiments conducted in the  laboratory of a Grand Master of the Sacred Art in the 5th or 6th  century.    _Experiment_.--Ordinary water is boiled in an open vessel; the water  is changed to a vapour which disappears, and a white powdery earth  remains in the vessel.    _Conclusion_.--Water is changed into air and earth.    Did we not know that ordinary water holds certain substances in  solution, and that boiling water acts on the vessel wherein it is  boiled, we should have no objection to urge against this conclusion.    It only remained to transmute fire that the transmutation of the four  elements might be completed.    _Experiment._--A piece of red-hot iron is placed in a bell-jar, filled  with water, held over a basin containing water; the volume of the  water decreases, and the air in the bell-jar takes fire when a lighted  taper is brought into it.    _Conclusion._--Water is changed into fire.    That interpretation was perfectly reasonable at a time when the fact  was unknown that water is composed of two gaseous substances; that one  of these (oxygen) is absorbed by the iron, and the other (hydrogen)  collects in the bell-jar, and ignites when brought into contact with a  flame.    _Experiment_.--Lead, or any other metal except gold or silver, is  calcined in the air; the metal loses its characteristic properties,  and is changed into a powdery substance, a kind of cinder or calx.  When this cinder, which was said to be the result of the _death of the  metal_, is heated in a crucible with some grains of wheat, one sees  the metal revive, and resume its original form and properties.    _Conclusion._--The metal which had been destroyed is revivified by the  grains of wheat and the action of fire.    Is this not to perform the miracle of the resurrection?    No objection can he raised to this interpretation, as long as we are  ignorant of the phenomena of oxidation, and the reduction of oxides by  means of carbon, or organic substances rich in carbon, such as sugar,  flour, seeds, etc. Grains of wheat were the symbol of life, and, by  extension, of the resurrection and eternal life.    [Illustration: FIG. IX. _See p. 91._]    _Experiment_.--Ordinary lead is calcined in a cupel made of cinders or  powdered bones; the lead is changed to a cinder which disappears into  the cupel, and a button of silver remains.    _Conclusion_.--The lead has vanished; what more natural than the  conclusion that it has been transformed into silver? It was not known  then that all specimens of lead contain more or less silver.    [Illustration: FIG. X. _See p. 92._]    _Experiment._-The vapour of arsenic bleaches copper. This fact gave  rise to many allegories and enigmas concerning the means of  transforming copper into silver.    Sulphur, which acts on metals and changes many of them into black  substances, was looked on as a very mysterious thing. It was with  sulphur that the coagulation (solidification) of mercury was effected.    _Experiment_.--Mercury is allowed to fall, in a fine rain, on to  melted sulphur; a black substance is produced; this black substance is  heated in a closed vessel, it is volatilised and transformed into a  beautiful red solid.    One could scarcely suppose that the black and the red substances are  identical, if one did not know that they are composed of the same  quantities of the same elements, sulphur and mercury.    How greatly must this phenomenon have affected the imagination of the  chemists of ancient times, always so ready to be affected by  everything that seemed supernatural!    Black and red were the symbols of darkness and light, of the evil and  the good principle; and the union of these two principles represented  the moral order. At a later time the idea helped to establish the  alchemical doctrine that sulphur and mercury are the Principles of all  things.    _Experiment._--Various organic substances are analysed by heating in a  distillation-apparatus; the products are, in each case, a solid  residue, liquids which distil off, and certain spirits which are  disengaged.    The results supported the ancient theory which asserted that _earth_,  _water_, _air_, and _fire_ are the four Elements of the world. The  solid residue represented _earth_; the liquid products of the  distillation, _water_; and the spirituous substances, _air_. _Fire_  was regarded sometimes as the means of purification, sometimes as the  soul, or invisible part, of all substances.    _Experiment_.-A strong acid is poured on to copper. The metal is  attacked, and at last disappears, giving place to a green liquid, as  transparent as water. A thin sheet of iron is plunged into the liquid;  the copper re-appears, and the iron vanishes.    What more simple than to conclude that the iron has been transformed  into copper?    Had lead, silver, or gold been used in place of copper, one would have  said that the iron was transformed into lead, silver, or gold.    In their search for \"the pure and penetrating matter which applied to  any substance exalts and perfects it after its own kind,\" the  alchemists necessarily made many inventions, laid the foundation of  many arts and manufactures, and discovered many facts of importance in  the science of chemistry.    The practitioners of the _Sacred Art_ of Egypt must have been  acquainted with many operations which we now class as belonging to  applied chemistry; witness, their jewellery, pottery, dyes and  pigments, bleaching, glass-making, working in metals and alloys, and  their use of spices, essential oils, and soda in embalming, and for  other purposes.    During the centuries when alchemy flourished, gunpowder was invented,  the art of printing was established, the compass was brought into use,  the art of painting and staining glass was begun and carried to  perfection, paper was made from rags, practical metallurgy advanced by  leaps and bounds, many new alloys of metals came into use, glass  mirrors were manufactured, and considerable advances were made in  practical medicine and sanitation.    [Illustration: FIG. XI. _See p. 92._]    Basil Valentine, who was one of the greatest alchemists of the 16th  century, discovered many of the properties of the metal antimony, and  prepared and examined many compounds of that metal; he made green  vitriol from pyrites, brandy from fermented grape-juice, fulminating  gold, sulphide of potash, and spirits of salt; he made and used baths  of artificial mineral waters, and he prepared various metals by what  are now called _wet methods_, for instance, copper, by immersing  plates of iron in solutions of bluestone. He examined the air of  mines, and suggested practical methods for determining whether the  air in a mine was respirable. Hoefer draws attention to a remarkable  observation recorded by this alchemist. Speaking of the \"spirit of  mercury,\" Basil Valentine says it is \"the origin of all the metals;  that spirit is nothing else than an air flying here and there without  wings; it is a moving wind, which, after it has been chased from its  home of Vulcan (that is, fire), returns to the chaos; then it expands  and passes into the region of the air from whence it had come.\" As  Hoefer remarks, this is perhaps one of the earliest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14226"],[0,"Lobo, Rag and Vixen (#12)"],[1,"reply. \"I fear you will run  once too often.\"    \"But, mother, it is such glorious fun to tease that fool dog, and it's  all good training. I'll thump if I am too hard pressed, then you can  come and change off while I get my second wind.\"    On he would come, and Ranger would take the trail and follow till Rag  got tired of it. Then he either sent a thumping telegram for help, which  brought Molly to take charge of the dog, or he got rid of the dog by  some clever trick. A description of one of these shows how well Rag had  learned the arts of the woods.    He knew that his scent lay best near the ground, and was strongest when  he was warm. So if he could get off the ground, and be left in peace for  half an hour to cool off, and for the trail to stale, he knew he would  be safe. When, therefore, he tired of the chase, he made for the  Creekside brier-patch, where he 'wound'--that is, zigzagged--till he  left a course so crooked that the dog was sure to be greatly delayed in  working it out. He then went straight to D in the woods, passing one hop  to windward of the high log E. Stopping at D, he followed his back trail  to F, here he leaped aside and ran toward G. Then, returning on his  trail to J, he waited till the hound passed on his trail at I. Rag then  got back on his old    [Illustration]    trail at H, and followed it to E, where, with a scent-baulk or great  leap aside, he reached the high log, and running to its higher end, he  sat like a bump.    Ranger lost much time in the bramble maize, and the scent was very poor  when he got it straightened out and came to D. Here he began to circle  to pick it up, and after losing much time, struck the trail which ended  suddenly at G. Again he was at fault, and had to circle to find the  trail. Wider and wider the circles, until at last, he passed right under  the log Rag was on. But a cold scent, on a cold day, does not go  downward much. Rag never budged nor winked, and the hound passed.    Again the dog came round. This time he crossed the low part of the log,  and stopped to smell it. 'Yes, clearly it was rabbity,' but it was a  stale scent now; still he mounted the log.    It was a trying moment for Rag, as the great hound came sniff-sniffing  along the log. But his nerve did not forsake him; the wind was right; he  had his mind made up to bolt as soon as Ranger came half way up. But he  didn't come. A yellow cur would have seen the rabbit sitting there, but  the hound did not, and the scent seemed stale, so he leaped off the log,  and Rag had won.          VII      Rag had never seen any other rabbit than his mother. Indeed he had  scarcely thought about there being any other. He was more and more away  from her now, and yet he never felt lonely, for rabbits do not hanker  for company. But one day in December, while he was among the red  dogwood brush, cutting a new path to the great Creekside thicket, he saw  all at once against the sky over the Sunning Bank the head and ears of a  strange rabbit. The new-comer had the air of a well-pleased discoverer  and soon came hopping Rag's way along one of _his_ paths into _his_  Swamp. A new feeling rushed over him, that boiling mixture of anger and  hatred called jealousy.    The stranger stopped at one of Rag's rubbing-trees--that is, a tree  against which he used to stand on his heels and rub his chin as far up  as he could reach. He thought he did this simply because he liked it;  but all buck-rabbits do so, and several ends are served. It makes the  tree rabbity, so that other rabbits know that this swamp already belongs  to a rabbit family and is not open for settlement. It also lets the next  one know by the scent if the last caller was an acquaintance, and the  height from the ground of the rubbing-places shows how tall the rabbit  is.    Now to his disgust Rag noticed that the new-comer was a head taller than  himself, and a big, stout buck at that. This was a wholly new experience  and filled Rag with a wholly new feeling. The spirit of murder entered  his heart; he chewed very hard with nothing in his mouth, and hopping  forward onto a smooth piece of hard ground he struck slowly:    '_Thump--thump--thump_,' which is a rabbit telegram for 'Get out of my  swamp, or fight.'    The new-comer made a big V with his ears, sat upright for a few seconds,  then, dropping on his fore-feet, sent along the ground a louder,  stronger, '_Thump--thump--thump_.'    And so war was declared.    They came together by short runs sidewise, each one trying to get the  wind of the other and watching for a chance advantage. The stranger was  a big, heavy buck with plenty of muscle, but one or two trifles such as  treading on a turnover and failing to close when Rag was on low ground  showed that he had not much cunning and counted on winning his battles  by his weight. On he came at last and Rag met him like a little fury. As  they came together they leaped up and struck out with their hind feet.  _Thud, thud_ they came, and down went poor little Rag. In a moment the  stranger was on him with his teeth and Rag was bitten, and lost several  tufts of hair before he could get up. But he was swift of foot and got  out of reach. Again he charged and again he was knocked down and bitten  severely. He was no match for his foe, and it soon became a question of  saving his own life.    Hurt as he was he sprang away, with the stranger in full chase, and  bound to kill him as well as to oust him from the Swamp where he was  born. Rag's legs were good and so was his wind. The stranger was big and  so heavy that he soon gave up the chase, and it was well for poor Rag  that he did, for he was getting stiff from his wounds as well as tired.  From that day began a reign of terror for Rag. His training had been  against owls, dogs, weasels, men, and so on, but what to do when chased  by another rabbit, he did not know. All he knew was to lay low till he  was found, then run.    Poor little Molly was completely terrorized; she could not help Rag and  sought only to hide. But the big buck soon found her out. She tried to  run from him, but she was not now so swift as Rag. The stranger made no  attempt to kill her, but he made love to her, and because she hated him  and tried to get away, he treated her shamefully. Day after day he  worried her by following her about, and often, furious at her lasting  hatred, he would knock her down and tear out mouthfuls of her soft fur  till his rage cooled somewhat, when he would let her go for awhile. But  his fixed purpose was to kill Rag, whose escape seemed hopeless. There  was no other swamp he could go to, and whenever he took a nap now he had  to be ready at any moment to dash for his life. A dozen times a day the  big stranger came creeping up to where he slept, but each time the  watchful Rag awoke in time to escape. To escape yet not to escape. He  saved his life indeed, but oh! what a miserable life it had become. How  maddening to be thus helpless, to see his little mother daily beaten and  torn, as well as to see all his favorite feeding-grounds, the cosey  nooks, and the pathways he had made with so much labor, forced from him  by this hateful brute. Unhappy Rag realized that to the victor belong  the spoils, and he hated him more than ever he did fox or ferret.    How was it to end? He was wearing out with running and watching and bad  food, and little Molly's strength and spirit were breaking down under  the long persecution. The stranger was ready to go to all lengths to  destroy poor Rag, and at last stooped to the worst crime known among  rabbits. However much they may hate each other, all good rabbits forget  their feuds when their common enemy appears. Yet one day when a great  goshawk came swooping over the Swamp, the stranger, keeping well under  cover himself, tried again and again to drive Rag into the open.    Once or twice the hawk nearly had him, but still the briers saved him,  and it was only when the big buck himself came near being caught that he  gave it up. And again Rag escaped, but was no better off. He made up his  mind to leave, with his mother, if possible, next night and go into the  world in quest of some new home when he heard old Thunder, the hound,  sniffing and searching about the outskirts of the swamp, and he resolved  on playing a desperate game. He deliberately crossed the hound's view,  and the chase that then began was fast and furious. Thrice around the  Swamp they went till Rag had made sure that his mother was hidden safely  and that his hated foe was in his usual nest. Then right into that nest  and plump over him he jumped, giving him a rap with one hind foot as he  passed over his head.    \"You miserable fool, I kill you yet,\" cried the stranger, and up he  jumped only to find himself between Rag and the dog and heir to all the  peril of the chase.    On came the hound baying hotly on the straight-away scent. The buck's  weight and size were great advantages in a rabbit fight, but now they  were fatal. He did not know many tricks. Just the simple ones like  'double,' 'wind,' and 'hole-up,' that every baby Bunny knows. But the  chase was too close for doubling and winding, and he didn't know where  the holes were.    It was a straight race. The brier-rose, kind to all rabbits alike, did  its best, but it was no use. The baying of the hound was fast and  steady. The crashing of the brush and the yelping of the hound each time  the briers tore his tender ears were borne to the two rabbits where they  crouched in hiding. But suddenly these sounds stopped, there was a  scuffle, then loud and terrible screaming.    Rag knew what it meant and it sent a shiver through him, but he soon  forgot that when all was over and rejoiced to be once more the master of  the dear old Swamp.          VIII      Old Olifant had doubtless a right to burn all those brush-piles in the  east and south of the Swamp and to clear up the wreck of the old  barbed-wire hog-pen"]]]
