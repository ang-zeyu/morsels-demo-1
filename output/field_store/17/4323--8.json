The crew of the Royal George were  turned over to her, and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoisted  on board, the blue at the maintop-gallant mast head. There was a very  great fleet of men of war of every description assembled together for  this expedition, and I was in hopes soon to have an opportunity of  being gratified with a sea-fight. All things being now in readiness,  this mighty fleet (for there was also Admiral Cornish's fleet in  company, destined for the East Indies) at last weighed anchor, and  sailed. The two fleets continued in company for several days, and then  parted; Admiral Cornish, in the Lenox, having first saluted our  admiral in the Namur, which he returned. We then steered for America;  but, by contrary winds, we were driven to Teneriffe, where I was  struck with its noted peak. Its prodigious height, and its form,  resembling a sugar-loaf, filled me with wonder. We remained in sight  of this island some days, and then proceeded for America, which we  soon made, and got into a very commodious harbour called St. George,  in Halifax, where we had fish in great plenty, and all other fresh  provisions. We were here joined by different men of war and transport  ships with soldiers; after which, our fleet being increased to a  prodigious number of ships of all kinds, we sailed for Cape Breton in  Nova Scotia. We had the good and gallant General Wolfe on board our  ship, whose affability made him highly esteemed and beloved by all the  men. He often honoured me, as well as other boys, with marks of his  notice; and saved me once a flogging for fighting with a young  gentleman. We arrived at Cape Breton in the summer of 1758: and here  the soldiers were to be landed, in order to make an attack upon  Louisbourgh. My master had some part in superintending the landing;  and here I was in a small measure gratified in seeing an encounter  between our men and the enemy. The French were posted on the shore to  receive us, and disputed our landing for a long time; but at last they  were driven from their trenches, and a complete landing was effected.  Our troops pursued them as far as the town of Louisbourgh. In this  action many were killed on both sides. One thing remarkable I saw this  day:--A lieutenant of the Princess Amelia, who, as well as my master,  superintended the landing, was giving the word of command, and while  his mouth was open a musquet ball went through it, and passed out at  his cheek. I had that day in my hand the scalp of an indian king, who  was killed in the engagement: the scalp had been taken off by an  Highlander. I saw this king's ornaments too, which were very curious,  and made of feathers.    Our land forces laid siege to the town of Louisbourgh, while the  French men of war were blocked up in the harbour by the fleet, the  batteries at the same time playing upon them from the land. This they  did with such effect, that one day I saw some of the ships set on fire  by the shells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them  were quite burnt. At another time, about fifty boats belonging to the  English men of war, commanded by Captain George Balfour of the AEtna  fire-ship, and another junior captain, Laforey, attacked and boarded  the only two remaining French men of war in the harbour. They also set  fire to a seventy-gun ship, but a sixty-four, called the Bienfaisant,  they brought off. During my stay here I had often an opportunity of  being near Captain Balfour, who was pleased to notice me, and liked me  so much that he often asked my master to let him have me, but he would  not part with me; and no consideration could have induced me to leave  him. At last Louisbourgh was taken, and the English men of war came  into the harbour before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more  liberty of indulging myself, and I went often on shore. When the ships  were in the harbour we had the most beautiful procession on the water  I ever saw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full  dressed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came  alongside of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on shore in his  barge, followed by the other officers in order of seniority, to take  possession, as I suppose, of the town and fort. Some time after this  the French governor and his lady, and other persons of note, came on  board our ship to dine. On this occasion our ships were dressed with  colours of all kinds, from the topgallant-mast head to the deck; and  this, with the firing of guns, formed a most grand and magnificent  spectacle.    As soon as every thing here was settled Admiral Boscawen sailed with  part of the fleet for England, leaving some ships behind with  Rear-admirals Sir Charles Hardy and Durell. It was now winter; and one  evening, during our passage home, about dusk, when we were in the  channel, or near soundings, and were beginning to look for land, we  descried seven sail of large men of war, which stood off shore.  Several people on board of our ship said, as the two fleets were (in  forty minutes from the first sight) within hail of each other, that  they were English men of war; and some of our people even began to  name some of the ships. By this time both fleets began to mingle, and  our admiral ordered his flag to be hoisted. At that instant the other  fleet, which were French, hoisted their ensigns, and gave us a  broadside as they passed by. Nothing could create greater surprise and  confusion among us than this: the wind was high, the sea rough, and we  had our lower and middle deck guns housed in, so that not a single gun  on board was ready to be fired at any of the French ships. However,  the Royal William and the Somerset being our sternmost ships, became a  little prepared, and each gave the French ships a broadside as they  passed by. I afterwards heard this was a French squadron, commanded by  Mons. Conflans; and certainly had the Frenchmen known our condition,  and had a mind to fight us, they might have done us great mischief.  But we were not long before we were prepared for an engagement.  Immediately many things were tossed overboard; the ships were made  ready for fighting as soon as possible; and about ten at night we had  bent a new main sail, the old one being split. Being now in readiness  for fighting, we wore ship, and stood after the French fleet, who  were one or two ships in number more than we. However we gave them  chase, and continued pursuing them all night; and at daylight we saw  six of them, all large ships of the line, and an English East  Indiaman, a prize they had taken. We chased them all day till between  three and four o'clock in the evening, when we came up with, and  passed within a musquet shot of, one seventy-four gun ship, and the  Indiaman also, who now hoisted her colours, but immediately hauled  them down again. On this we made a signal for the other ships to take  possession of her; and, supposing the man of war would likewise  strike, we cheered, but she did not; though if we had fired into her,  from being so near, we must have taken her. To my utter surprise the  Somerset, who was the next ship astern of the Namur, made way  likewise; and, thinking they were sure of this French ship, they  cheered in the same manner, but still continued to follow us. The  French Commodore was about a gun-shot ahead of all, running from us  with all speed; and about four o'clock he carried his foretopmast  overboard. This caused another loud cheer with us; and a little after  the topmast came close by us; but, to our great surprise, instead of  coming up with her, we found she went as fast as ever, if not faster.  The sea grew now much smoother; and the wind lulling, the seventy-four  gun ship we had passed came again by us in the very same direction,  and so near, that we heard her people talk as she went by; yet not a  shot was fired on either side; and about five or six o'clock, just as  it grew dark, she joined her commodore. We chased all night; but the  next day they were out of sight, so that we saw no more of them; and  we only had the old Indiaman (called Carnarvon I think) for our  trouble. After this we stood in for the channel, and soon made the  land; and, about the close of the year 1758-9, we got safe to St.  Helen's. Here the Namur ran aground; and also another large ship  astern of us; but, by starting our water, and tossing many things  overboard to lighten her, we got the ships off without any damage. We  stayed for a short time at Spithead, and then went into Portsmouth  harbour to refit; from whence the admiral went to London; and my  master and I soon followed, with a press-gang, as we wanted some hands  to complete our complement.

Some people go on drinking these poisons for many years, and seem not to be  hurt by them; but at last they suffer from what is called Alcoholic  Phthisis, a kind of consumption which doctors cannot cure.

Where is your brain?--\"In my skull.\" What color is it?--\"Gray and white.\"  What does it resemble?--\"Marrow.\" What work is done in the brain?--\"The  work of thinking.\" You may repeat what you have learned about the membranes  of the brain. (See Formula for the Lesson on the Nervous System.)    You say \"the inner membrane is a net-work of blood-vessels.\" If these are  blood-vessels in the membranes, what fills them?--\"Blood.\" Do you think  alcohol can get into the brain?--\"Yes.\" How can it get there?--\"It goes  there with the blood.\" How can we know that alcohol does mischief in the  brain? You cannot answer? Did you never see a drunken man? Now tell me how  you might know his brain has been hurt by alcohol.--\"He talks funny; he  acts strangely; he is very cross; he does not know what he is doing; he  walks crookedly; he falls down; sometimes he falls asleep, and is almost  like a dead man; he is dead drunk.\"    Let us study to learn why the drunken man does such strange things. The  alcohol in this bottle, and this egg which you see, will help us find the  cause of the mischief. You may tell what is in the egg.--\"A white liquid  and a yellow liquid.\" How could they be made hard?--\"By making the egg hot;  by boiling.\" We will try what alcohol will do to the white part. You see  when it is poured upon the white of the egg it hardens this part as boiling  would harden it. This white portion is composed of water and something  called _albumen_. The alcohol dries up the water and thickens the albumen.    Albumen is found not only in eggs but in some seeds, as beans, peas, corn,  etc., also in the gray part of the brain and in the nerves.    We will talk first of the harm alcohol does to the nerves. You know they  are the grayish-white cords which pass from the brain and the spine to  every part of the body. What do they act like in the kind of work they  do?--\"Like telegraph wires.\" What is their work?--\"To carry messages to and  from the brain.\" What kinds of nerves have you learned about?--\"Nerves of  feeling and nerves of motion.\"    When alcohol touches a nerve, it draws away the moisture or water from it,  and hardens the white part or albumen; this makes the nerve shrivel as if  it had been burned; it loses its power to feel and move, or, to use a long  word, is _paralyzed_.    Alcohol paralyzes all the nerves it touches. It makes them so stupid that  they cannot understand what the brain says to them, and they do not carry  the right messages back to it. For instance: when the nerves of the stomach  are poisoned by the alcohol in beer, wine, etc., they do not feel the pain  of hunger as much as they otherwise would, and they let the brain think the  stomach is satisfied and does not need any more food, when it is only  stupefied by these liquors.    Again, it is the work of some nerves to tell the muscles of the small  arteries to tighten, or contract, when too much blood is coming into them.  Alcohol so paralyzes these nerves that they do not carry their message; the  arteries let in the blood, and become swollen and enlarged. They tell the  mischief done to them, by causing the skin to be red or flushed. If people  drink much of any intoxicating liquor, and often, their skin is always a  bad color, or, as grown folks say, becomes permanently discolored. All this  because the nerves have been made unfit to do their duty by alcohol poison.    The nerves also lose power over the muscles of the limbs. This is plainly  seen in the trembling of the hands and the unsteady walking of the  drunkard; but is equally true of those who drink only a little now and  then. Their nerves are not as strong and wide-awake to control the  machinery of the body as they would be if no alcohol were troubling them.    Sometimes the nerves of hearing and sight tell the brain queer stories, and  the poor brain believes them all, for it, too, is stupefied by the same  fire-water which has hurt the nerves. Indeed, the harm done by alcohol to  the brain is greater than that done to any other part of the body. It takes  the water from the albumen, and makes the white part of the brain hard, as  if it had been cooked. It kills the little, circle-shaped, red parts of the  blood--the corpuscles; these collect in the blood-vessels of the brain, and  keep the blood from flowing as fast as it ought, which causes disease and  very often death. Sometimes the brain is so much injured by the poison that  the drinker becomes crazy, and is a great deal of trouble to himself and  everybody else.    Since all this is true, wise children will let cider, lager, ale, wine, and  every other kind of alcoholic drink alone, and never, NEVER,      \"Put an enemy into their mouths,    To steal away their brains.\"           *       *       *       *       *                    HARM DONE BY ALCOHOL TO THE  NERVES.

In the lessons you have learned you have been taught about the harm done by  alcohol to the body and the mind; can you tell, from what you have seen of  drunken people, in what other way alcoholic liquors hurt them?--\"They make  people waste their money; they make them waste their time; they make them  cross; they make them fight; they make them say silly and wicked words;  they sometimes make fathers and mothers hurt their children; they make  people lose their good name; they often make them do things for which they  are sent to prison.\"    Yes, this is only some of the mischief done by alcohol. If you could fly  around the world and see everybody who has been hurt in any way by this  terrible poison, what a sad, sad sight you would behold! At least half the  trouble in the world comes from strong drink.    Are _you_, little girl, little boy, going to join the army of drunkards?  No, indeed! you think; but probably no one who has become a drunkard ever  intended to do so. They all began with one glass, a few drops of some  alcoholic liquor,--cider, wine, or beer perhaps,--and thus learned to love  the taste of alcohol, and soon became its slaves. For this poison has the  strange power of making those who drink it want more and more of itself,  though they know it is doing them harm.    The only safety is in letting alcoholic liquors alone, forever.    BLACKBOARD OUTLINE.

He would go to the barrel of cider in the  cellar, which had been put there to make vinegar, and, getting a straw,  would suck all the cider he wanted; and then, after he had played awhile,  he would go back and get more. He kept on drinking alcoholic liquors of  some kind, until he died a drunkard.    CIDER DELIRIUM.--Dr. J.H. Travis, of Masonville, N.Y., was once called to a  child six years old, who was raving in the wildest delirium. His symptoms  were so peculiar that he questioned the family closely, and found that the  day previous, at a raising, the child had drank freely of cider.
