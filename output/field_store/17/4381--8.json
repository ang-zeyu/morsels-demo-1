The  whole foundation of the language, vocabulary, grammar, and everything  else, is contained in one small book of a few pages, called _Fundamento  de Esperanto_. No change can be made in this except by a competent  elected international authority. Of course, no text-books or grammars  will be authorized for the use of any nation that are not in accordance  with the _Fundamento_. People will make mistakes, of course, just as  they make mistakes in any foreign language, and they can help themselves  out with any words from other languages, just as they do now when their  French or German fails them. But the standard is always there, simple  and short, to correct any aberration, and there is no room for any  alterations in form or structure to creep in.                                      XIV         OBJECTION THAT THE PRESENT INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE (ESPERANTO)            IS TOO DOGMATIC, AND REFUSES TO PROFIT BY CRITICISM    It is true that Esperantists refuse to make any change in their language  at present, and this is found irritating by some able critics, who  wrongly imagine that this attitude amounts to a claim of perfection for  Esperanto. The matter may be easily put right.    The inadmissibility of change (even for the better) is purely a matter  of policy and dictated by practical considerations. Esperantists  make no claim to infallibility; they want to see their language  universally adopted, and they want to see it as perfect as possible.  Actual and bitter experience shows that the international language  which admits change is lost. Universal acceptance and present change  are incompatible. Esperantists, therefore, bow to the inevitable and  deliberately choose to concentrate for the present on acceptance.  General acceptance, indeed, while it imposes upon the present body of  Esperantists self-restraint in abstaining from change, is in reality  the essential condition of profitable future amendment. When an  international language has attained the degree of dissemination already  enjoyed by Esperanto, the only safe kind of change that can be made  is _a posteriori_, not _a priori_. When Esperanto has been officially  adopted and comes into wide use, actual experience and consensus of  usage amongst its leading writers will indicate the modifications that  are ripe for official adoption. The competent international official  authority will then from time to time duly register such changes, and  they will become officially part of the language.    Till then, any change can only cause confusion and alienate support.  No one is going to spend time learning a language which is one thing  to-day and another thing to-morrow. When the time comes for change,  the authority will only proceed cautiously one step at a time, and its  decrees will only set the seal upon that which actual use has hit off.    This, then, is the explanation of the famous adjective \"netusxebla,\"  applied by Dr. Zamenhof to his language, and so much resented in certain  quarters. Surely not only is this degree of dogmatism amply justified  by practical considerations, but it would amount to positive imprudence  on the part of Esperantists to act otherwise. If the inventor of the  language can show sufficient self-restraint, after long years spent in  touching and retouching his language, to hold his hand at a given point  (and he has declared that self-restraint is necessary), surely others  need not be hurt at their suggestions not being adopted, even though  they may in some cases be real improvements.    The following extracts, translated from the Preface to _Fundamento  de Esperanto_ (the written basic law of Esperanto), should set the  question in the right light. It will be seen that Dr. Zamenhof expressly  contemplates the \"gradual perfection\" (_perfektigado_) of his language,  and by no means lays claim to finality or infallibility.    \"Having the character of _fundament_, the three works reprinted in this  volume must be above all inviolable (_netusxeblaj_).... The fundament  must remain inviolable _even with its errors...._ Having once lost  its strict inviolability, the work would lose its exceptional and  necessary character of dogmatic fundamentality; and the user, finding  one translation in one edition, and another in another, would have  no security that I should not make another change to-morrow, and his  confidence and support would be lost.    \"To any one who shows me an expression that is not good in the  Fundamental book, I shall calmly reply: Yes, it is an error; but it must  remain inviolable, for it belongs to the fundamental document, in which  no one has the right to make any change.... I showed, _in principle_,  how the strict inviolability of the _Fundamento_ will always preserve  the unity of our language, without however preventing the language  not only from becoming richer, but even from constantly becoming more  perfect. But _in practice_ we (for causes already many times explained)  must naturally be very cautious in the process of 'perfecting' the  language: (_a_) we must not do this light-heartedly, but only in case of  absolute necessity; (_b_) it can only be done (after mature judgment) by  some central institution, having indisputable authority for the whole  Esperanto world, and not by any private persons....    \"Until the time when a central authoritative institution shall decide  to _augment_ (never to _change_) the existing fundament by rendering  official new words or rules, everything good, which is not to be found  in the _Fundamento de Esperanto_, is to be regarded not as compulsory,  but only as recommended.\"                                         XV               SUMMARY OF OBJECTIONS TO AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE    An attempt has been made in the preceding chapters to deal with the  more important and obvious arguments put forward by those who will hear  nothing of an international language. The objections are, however, so  numerous, cover such a wide field, and in some cases are so mutually  destructive, that it may be instructive to present them in an orderly  classification.                For there we have them all \"at one fell swoop,\"                 Instead of being scattered through the pages;              They stand forth marshalled in a handsome troop,                 To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages.                                                                BYRON.    Let us hope that they will die of exposure, like the famous appendix  pilloried by Byron, and that the ingenuous one will be able to regard  them as literary curiosities.    If the business of an argument is to be unanswerable, the place of  honour certainly belongs to the religious argument. Any one who really  believes that an international language is an impious attempt to reverse  the judgment of Babel will continue firm in his faith, though one speak  with the tongues of men and of angels.    Here, then, are the objections, classified according to content.                      OBJECTIONS TO AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE    I. _Religious_.    It is doomed to confusion, because it reverses the judgment of Babel.    II. _Aesthetic and sentimental_.    (1) It is a cheap commercial scheme, unworthy of the attention of  scholars.    (2) It vulgarizes the world and tends to dull uniformity.    (3) It weakens patriotism by diluting national spirit with  cosmopolitanism.    (4) It has no history, no link with the past.    (5) It is artificial, which is a sin in itself.    III. _Political_.    (1) It is against English [Frenchmen read \"French\"] interests, as  diverting prestige from the national tongue.    (2) It is socialistic and even anarchical in tendency, and will  facilitate the operations of the international disturbers of society.    IV. _Literary and linguistic_.    (1) Lacking history and associations, it is unpoetical and unsuited to  render the finer shades of thought and feeling. It will, therefore,  degrade and distort the monuments of national literatures which may be  translated into it.    (2) It may even discourage authors, ambitious of a wide public, from  writing in their own tongue. Original works in the artificial language  can never have the fine savour of a master's use of his mother tongue.    (3) Its precisely formal and logical vocabulary and construction  debauches the literary sense for the niceties of expression. Therefore,  even if not used as a substitute for the mother tongue, its concurrent  use, which will be thrust on everybody, will weaken the best work in  native idioms.    (4) It will split up into dialects.    (5) Pronunciation will vary so as to be unintelligible.    (6) It is too dogmatic, and refuses to profit by criticism.    V. _Educational and cultural_.    (1) It will prejudice the study of modern languages.    (2) It will provide a \"soft option\" for examinees.    VI. _Personal and particular_.    It is prejudicial to the vested interests of modern language teachers,  foreign correspondence clerks, interpreters, multilingual waiters and  hotel porters.    VII. _Technical_.    This heading includes the criticisms in detail of various schemes--e.g.  it is urged against Esperanto that its accent is monotonous; that its  accusative case is unnecessary; that its principle of word-formation  from roots is not strictly logical; that its vocabulary is too Romance;  that its vocabulary is not Romance enough; and so forth.    VIII. _Popular_.    (1) It is a wild idea put forth by a set of cranks, who would be better  occupied in something else.    (2) It is impossible.    (3) It is too hard: life isn't long enough.    (4) It is not hard enough: lessons will be too quickly done, and will  not sink into the mind.    (5) It will oust all other languages, and thus destroy each nation's  birthright and heritage.    (6) It will not come in in our time, so the question is of no interest  except to our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16751"],[0,"McGuffey's Sixth Eclectic Reader (#12)"],[1," witness  this daily manifestation of the power and wisdom of the Creator, and yet  say in their hearts, \"There is no God.\"    Notes.--Jupiter, the largest planet of the solar system, and, next to  Venus, the brightest.

DESCRIPTION OF A STORM. (70)    Benjamin Disraeli. 1805-1881, was of Jewish descent. His ancestors were  driven out of Spain by the Inquisition, and went to Venice. In 1748, his  grandfather came to England. His father was Isaac Disraeli, well known as  a literary man. Benjamin was born in London, and received his early  education under his father. He afterwards studied for a lawyer, but soon  gave up his profession for literature. His first novel, \"Vivian Grey,\"  appeared when the author was twenty-one years of age; it received much  attention. After several defeats he succeeded in an election to  Parliament, and took his seat in that body, in the first year of  Victoria's reign. On his first attempt to speak in Parliament, the House  refused to hear him. It is said that, as he sat down, he remarked that the  time would come when they would hear him. In 1849, he became the leader of  the Conservative party in the House. During the administration of W. E.  Gladstone, Mr. Disraeli was leader of the opposition. In 1868, he became  prime minister, holding the office for a short time. In 1874, he was again  appointed to the same office, where he remained until 1880. His wife was  made Viscountess of Beaconsfield in 1868. After her death, the title of  Earl of Beaconsfield was conferred on Disraeli. He ranked among the most  eminent, statesmen of the age, but always devoted a portion of his time to  literature. \"Lothair,\" a novel, was published in 1870.  ###      * * * They looked round on every side, and hope gave way before the scene  of desolation. Immense branches were shivered from the largest trees;  small ones were entirely stripped of their leaves; the long grass was  bowed to the earth; the waters were whirled in eddies out of the little  rivulets; birds, leaving their nests to seek shelter in the crevices of  the rocks, unable to stem the driving air, flapped their wings and fell  upon the earth; the frightened animals of the plain, almost suffocated by  the impetuosity of the wind, sought safety and found destruction; some of  the largest trees were torn up by the roots; the sluices of the mountains  were filled, and innumerable torrents rushed down the before empty  gullies. The heavens now open, and the lightning and thunder contend with  the horrors of the wind.    In a moment, all was again hushed. Dead silence succeeded the bellow of  the thunder, the roar of the wind, the rush of the waters, the moaning of  the beasts, the screaming of the birds. Nothing was heard save the plash  of the agitated lake, as it beat up against the black rocks which girt it  in.    Again, greater darkness enveloped the trembling earth. Anon, the heavens  were rent with lightning, which nothing could have quenched but the  descending deluge. Cataracts poured down from the lowering firmament. For  an instant, the horses dashed madly forward; beast and rider blinded and  stifled by the gushing rain, and gasping for breath. Shelter was nowhere.  The quivering beasts reared, and snorted, and sank upon their knees,  dismounting their riders.    He had scarcely spoken, when there burst forth a terrific noise, they knew  not what; a rush, they could not understand; a vibration which shook them  on their horses. Every terror sank before the roar of the cataract. It  seemed that the mighty mountain, unable to support its weight of waters,  shook to the foundation. A lake had burst upon its summit, and the  cataract became a falling ocean. The source of the great deep appeared to  be discharging itself over the range of mountains; the great gray peak  tottered on its foundation!--It shook!--it fell!  and buried in its ruins  the castle, the village, and the bridge!        V. AFTER THE THUNDERSTORM. (72)    James Thomson, 1700-1748, the son of a clergyman, was born in Scotland. He  studied at the University of Edinburgh, and intended to follow the  profession of his father, but never entered upon the duties of the sacred  office. In 1724 he went to London, where he spent most of his subsequent  life. He had shown some poetical talent when it boy; and, in 1826, he  published \"Winter,\" a part of a longer poem, entitled \"The Seasons,\" the  best known of all his works. He also wrote several plays for the stage;  none of them, however, achieved any great success. In the last year of his  life, he published his \"Castle of Indolence,\" the most famous of his works  excepting \"The Seasons.\" Thomson was heavy and dull in his personal  appearance, and was indolent in his habits. The moral tone of his writings  is always good. This extract is from \"The Seasons.\"  ###          As from the face of heaven the shattered clouds    Tumultuous rove, the interminable sky    Sublimer swells, and o'er the world expands    A purer azure.               Through the lightened air    A higher luster and a clearer calm,    Diffusive, tremble; while, as if in sign    Of danger past, a glittering robe of joy,    Set off abundant by the yellow ray,    Invests the fields; and nature smiles revived.        'T is beauty all, and grateful song around,    Joined to the low of kine, and numerous bleat    Of flocks thick-nibbling through the clovered vale:    And shall the hymn be marred by thankless man,    Most favored; who, with voice articulate,    Should lead the chorus of this lower world?        Shall man, so soon forgetful of the Hand    That hushed the thunder, and serenes the sky,    Extinguished fed that spark the tempest waked,    That sense of powers exceeding far his own,    Ere yet his feeble heart has lost its fears?        VI. HOUSE CLEANING. (73)    Francis Hopkinson, 1737-1791. He was the son of an Englishman; born in  Philadelphia, and was educated at the college of that city, now the  University of Pennsylvania. He represented New Jersey in the Congress of  1776, and was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He  was one of the most sensible and elegant writers of his time, and  distinguished himself both in prose and verse. His lighter writings abound  in humor and keen satire; his more solid writings are marked by clearness  and good sense. His pen did much to forward the cause of American  independence. His \"Essay on Whitewashing,\" from which the following  extract is taken, was mistaken for the composition of Dr. Franklin, and  published among his writings, It was originally in the form of \"A Letter  from a Gentleman in America to his Friend in Europe, on Whitewashing.\"  ###      There is no season of the year in which the lady may not, if she pleases,  claim her privilege; but the latter end of May is generally fixed upon for  the purpose. The attentive husband may judge, by certain prognostics, when  the storm is at hand. If the lady grows uncommonly fretful, finds fault  with the servants, is discontented with the children, and complains much  of the nastiness of everything about her, these are symptoms which ought  not to be neglected, yet they sometimes go off without any further effect.      But if, when the husband rises in the morning, he should observe in the  yard a wheelbarrow with a quantity of lime in it, or should see certain  buckets filled with a solution of lime in water, there is no time for  hesitation. He immediately locks up the apartment or closet where his  papers and private property are kept, and, putting the key into his  pocket, betakes himself to flight. A husband, however beloved, becomes a  perfect nuisance during this season of female rage. His authority is  superseded, his commission suspended, and the very scullion who cleans the  brasses in the kitchen becomes of more importance than he. He has nothing  for it but to abdicate for a time, and run from an evil which he can  neither prevent nor mollify.    The husband gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are stripped of their  furniture--paintings, prints, and looking-glasses lie huddled in heaps  about the floors; the curtains are torn from their testers, the beds  crammed into windows, chairs and tables, bedsteads and cradles, crowd the  yard, and the garden fence bends beneath the weight of carpets, blankets,  cloth cloaks, old coats, under petticoats, and ragged breeches. Here may  be seen the lumber of the kitchen, forming a dark and confused mass for  the foreground of the picture; gridirons and frying pans, rusty shovels  and broken tongs, joint stools, and the fractured remains of rush-bottomed  chairs. There a closet has disgorged its bowels--riveted plates and  dishes, halves of china bowls, cracked tumblers, broken wineglasses,  phials of forgotten physic, papers of unknown powders, seeds and dried  herbs, tops of teapots, and stoppers of departed decanters--from the rag  hole in the garret, to the rat hole in the cellar, no place escapes  unrummaged. It would seem as if the day of general doom had come, and the  utensils of the house were dragged forth to judgment.    In this tempest, the words of King Lear unavoidably present themselves,  and might, with little alteration, be made strictly applicable.        \"Let the great gods,    That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,    Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,    That hast within thee undivulged crimes    Unwhipp'd of justice.                  "]]]
