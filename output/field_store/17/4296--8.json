One lovely afternoon in the second week of their stay at Viamede, Mr.  Dinsmore and his daughter were seated in the shade of the trees on the  lawn, she busied with some fancy-work while her father read aloud to her.    As he paused to turn a leaf, \"Papa,\" she said, glancing off down the  bayou, \"there is a steamer coming, the same that brought us, I think; and  see, it is rounding to at our landing. Can it be bringing us a guest?\"    \"Yes, a gentleman is stepping ashore. Why, daughter, it is Harold  Allison.\"    \"Harold! oh, how delightful!\" And rising they hastened to meet and welcome  him with truly Southern warmth of hospitality.    \"Harold! how good of you!\" cried Elsie. \"Mamma wrote us that you were  somewhere in this region, and if I'd had your address, I should have sent  you an invitation to come and stay as long as possible.\"    \"And you have done well and kindly by us to come without waiting for  that,\" Mr. Dinsmore said, shaking the hand of his young brother-in-law  with a warmth of cordiality that said more than his words.    \"Many thanks to you both,\" he answered gayly. \"I was conceited enough to  feel sure of a welcome, and did not wait, as a more modest fellow might,  to be invited. But what a lovely place! a paradise upon earth! And, Elsie,  you, in those dainty white robes, look the fit presiding genius.\"    Elsie laughed and shook her head. \"Don't turn flatterer, Harold; though I  do not object to praise of Viamede.\"    \"I have not heard from Rose in a long time,\" he said, addressing Mr.  Dinsmore. \"She and the little folks are well, I hope?\"    \"I had a letter this morning, and they were all in good health when it was  written.\"    The servants had come trooping down from the house, and seizing Harold's  baggage had it all ready in the guest-chamber to which Aunt Phillis  ordered it. Aunt Chloe now drew near to pay her respects to \"Massa  Harold,\" and tell him that his room was ready.    \"Will you go to it at once? or sit down here and have a little chat with  papa and me first?\" asked Elsie.    \"Thank you; I think I shall defer the pleasure of the chat till I have  first made myself presentable for the evening.\"    \"Then let me conduct you to your room,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, leading the way  to the house.    Elsie had come in the course of years to look upon the older brothers of  her stepmother as in some sort her uncles, but for Harold, who was so much  nearer her own age, she entertained a sincere sisterly regard. And he was  worthy of it and of the warm place his many noble qualities had won for  him in Mr. Dinsmore's heart.    They did all they could to make his visit to Viamede a pleasant one; there  were daily rides and walks, moonlight and early morning excursions on the  bayou, rowing parties; oftenest of the three alone, but sometimes in  company with gallant chivalrous men and refined, cultivated women and  charming young girls from the neighboring plantations.    One of these last, a beautiful brunette, Elsie had selected in her own  mind for Harold, and she contrived to throw them together frequently.    \"Don't you admire Miss Durand?\" she asked, after they had met several  times. \"I think she is lovely; as good, too, as she is beautiful; and  would make you a charming wife.\"    He flushed hotly. \"She is very handsome, very fascinating and talented,\"  he said; \"but would never suit me. Nor do I suppose I could win her if I  wished.\"    \"Indeed! if you are so hard to please, I fear there will be nothing for  you but old bachelorhood,\" laughed Elsie. \"I have picked her out for you,  and I believe you could win her if you tried, Harold; but I shall not try  to become a match-maker.\"    \"No, I must select for myself; I couldn't let even you choose for me.\"    \"Choose what?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore, stepping out upon the veranda, where  Harold stood leaning against a vine-wreathed pillar, his blue eyes fixed  with a sort of wistful, longing look upon Elsie's graceful figure and fair  face, as she sat in a half-reclining posture on a low couch but a few  feet from him.    \"A wife,\" he answered, compelling himself to speak lightly.    \"Don't let her do it,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, taking a seat by his daughter's  side; \"I've warned her more than once not to meddle with match-making.\"  And he shook his head at her with mock gravity.    \"I won't any more, papa; I'll leave him to his own devices, since he shows  himself so ungrateful for my interest in his welfare,\" Elsie said, looking  first at her father and then at Harold with a merry twinkle in her eye.    \"I don't think I've asked how you like your new home and prospects,  Harold,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, changing the subject.    \"Very much, thank you; except that they take me so far from the rest of  the family.\"    A few months before this Harold had met with a piece of rare good fortune,  looked at from a worldly point of view, in being adopted as his sole heir  by a rich and childless Louisiana planter, a distant relative of Mrs.  Allison.    \"Ah, that is an objection,\" returned Mr. Dinsmore; \"but you will be  forming new and closer ties, that will doubtless go far to compensate for  the partial loss of the old. I hope you are enjoying yourself here?\"    \"I am indeed, thank you.\" This answer was true, yet Harold felt himself  flush as he spoke, for there was one serious drawback upon his felicity;  he could seldom get a word alone with Elsie; she and her father were so  inseparable that he scarcely saw the one without the other. And Harold  strongly coveted an occasional monopoly of the sweet girl's society. He  had come to Viamede with a purpose entirely unsuspected by her or her  apparently vigilant guardian.    He should perhaps, have confided his secret to Mr. Dinsmore first, but his  heart failed him; and \"what would be the use?\" he asked himself, \"if Elsie  is not willing? Ah, if I could but be alone with her for an hour!\"    The coveted opportunity offered itself at last, quite unexpectedly. Coming  out upon the veranda one afternoon, he saw Elsie sitting alone under a  tree far down on the lawn. He hastened towards her.    \"I am glad to see you,\" she said, looking up with a smile and making room  for him on the seat by her side. \"You see I am 'lone and lorn,' Mr. Durand  having carried off papa to look at some new improvement in his sugar-house  machinery.\"    \"Ah! and when will your father return?\"    \"In about an hour, I presume. Shall you attend Aunt Adie's wedding?\" she  asked.    \"Yes, I think so. Don't you sometimes feel as if you'd like to stay here  altogether?\"    \"Yes, and no; it's very lovely, and the more charming I believe, because  it is my own; but--there is so much more to bind me to the Oaks, and I  could never live far away from papa.\"    \"Couldn't you? I hoped---- Oh, Elsie, couldn't you possibly love some one  else better even than you love him? You're more to me than father, mother,  and all the world beside. I have wanted to tell you so for years, but  while I was comparatively poor your fortune sealed my lips. Now I am rich,  and I lay all I have at your feet; myself included; and----\"    \"Oh, Harold, hush!\" she cried in trembling tones, flushing and paling by  turns, and putting up her hand as if to stop the torrent of words he was  pouring forth so unexpectedly that astonishment had struck her dumb for an  instant; \"oh! don't say any more, I--I thought you surely knew that--that  I am already engaged.\"    \"No. To whom?\" he asked hoarsely, his face pale as death, and lips  quivering so that he could scarcely speak.    \"To Mr. Travilla. It has been only for a few weeks, though we have loved  each other for years. Oh, Harold, Harold, do not look so wretched! you  break my heart, for I love you as a very dear brother.\"    He turned away with a groan, and without another word hastened back to the  house, while Elsie, covering her face with her hands, shed some very  bitter tears.    Heart-broken, stunned, feeling as if every good thing in life had suddenly  slipped from his grasp, Harold sought his room, mechanically gathered up  his few effects, packed them into his valise, then sat down by the open  window and leant his head upon his hand.    He couldn't think, he could only feel that all was lost, and that he must  go away at once, if he would not have everybody know it, and make the idol  of his heart miserable with the sight of his wretchedness.    Why had he not known of her engagement? Why had no one told him? Why had  he been such a fool as to suppose he could win so great a prize? He was  not worthy of her. How plainly he saw it now, how sorely repented of the  conceit that had led him on to the avowal of his passion.    He had a vague recollection that a boat was to pass that afternoon. He  would take passage in that, and he hoped Mr. Dinsmore's return might be  delayed till he was gone. He would away without another word to Elsie; she  should not be disturbed by any further unmanly manifestation of his bitter  grief and despair.    The hour of the passing of the boat drew near, and valise in hand, he left  his room and passed down the stairs. But Elsie was coming in from the  lawn, and they met in the lower hall.    \"Harold,\" she cried, \"you are not going? You must not leave us so  suddenly.\"    \"I must,\" he said in icy tones, the stony eyes gazing into vacancy; \"all  places are alike to me now, and I cannot stay here to trouble you and  Horace with the sight of a wretchedness I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#12)"],[1," you wish, but that must be all.\"    Violet had been trained to cheerful acquiescence in the decisions of her  parents, and now put it in practice, yet wished very much that mamma would  let her work all day for Sally, till her outfit was ready; she was sure  she should not tire of it; but she soon learned anew the lessons she had  learned a hundred times before--that mamma knew best.    The first day she would have been willing to sew a little longer after the  second hour's task was done; the next, two hours were fully sufficient to  satisfy her appetite for work: on the third, it was a weariness before the  end of the first hour; on the fourth, she would have been glad to beg off  entirely, but her mother said firmly, \"No, dear; one hour's work is not  too much for you, and you know I allowed you to undertake it only on  condition that you would persevere to the end.\"    \"Yes, mamma, but I am very tired, and I think I'll never undertake  anything again,\" and with a little sigh the child seated herself and began  her task.    Mamma smiled sympathizingly, softly smoothed the golden curls, and said in  her own gentle voice, \"Let us not be weary in well-doing'! Do you remember  the rest of it?\"    \"Yes, mamma, 'for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.' And you  told us to faint was to get tired and stop. But mamma, what shall I reap  by keeping on with this?\"    \"A much needed lesson in perseverance, for one thing, I hope my little  daughter, and for another the promise given in the forty-first Psalm,  'Blessed is he that considereth the poor; the Lord will deliver him in  time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he  shall be blessed upon the earth; and thou wilt not deliver him unto the  will of his enemies. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of  languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.'    \"How would you like to hear a story while you sit here sewing by my side?\"    \"Oh, ever so much, mamma! A story! a story!\" And all the little flock  clustered about mamma's chair, for they dearly loved her stories.    This was an old favorite, but the narrator added some new characters and  new scenes, spinning it out, yet keeping up the interest, till it and the  hour came to an end very nearly together.    Then the children, finding that was to be all for the present, scattered  to their play.    Mrs. Ross had come in a few minutes before, and signing to her friend to  proceed, had joined the group of listeners.    \"Dear me, Elsie, how can you take so much trouble with your children?\" she  said. \"You seem to be always training and teaching them in the sweetest,  gentlest way; and of course they're good and obedient. I'm sure I love  mine dearly, but I could never have the patience to do all you do.\"    \"My dear friend, how can I do less, when so much of their future welfare,  for time and for eternity, depends upon my faithfulness?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lucy slowly, \"but the mystery to me is, how you can keep that  in mind all the time, and how you can contrive always to do the right  thing?\"    \"I wish I did, but it is not so; I make many mistakes.\"    \"I don't see it. You do wonderfully well anyhow, and I want to know how  you manage it.\"    \"I devote most of my time and thoughts to it; I try to study the character  of each child, and above all, I pray a great deal for wisdom and for God's  blessing on my efforts; not always on my knees, for it is a blessed  truth, that we may lift our hearts to him at any time and in any place.  Oh, Lucy,\" she exclaimed with tearful earnestness, \"if I can but train my  children for God and heaven, what a happy woman shall I be I the longing  desire of my heart for them is that expressed in the stanza of Watts's  Cradle Hymn:        'Mayst them live to know and fear him,        Trust and love him all thy days,       Then go dwell forever near him,        See his face and sing his praise!'\"            CHAPTER ELEVENTH.          \"Beware the bowl! though rich and bright,       Its rubies flash upon the sight,       An adder coils its depths beneath,       Whose lure is woe, whose sting is death.\"                                        --STREET.    Mrs. Ross had found a nurse for Mrs. Gibson and a seamstress to help with  the sewing; a good many of the needed garments were ordered from New York  ready made, and in a few days the invalid was comfortably established in  the seaside cottage recommended by Dr. Morton.    In another week, Sally found herself in possession of a wardrobe that more  than satisfied her modest desires. She called at the Crags in her new  traveling dress, to say good-bye, looking very neat and lady-like; happy  too, in spite of anxiety in regard to her sight.    Not used to the world, timid and retiring, she had felt a good deal of  nervous apprehension about taking the journey alone; but business called  Mr. Ross to Philadelphia, and he offered to take charge of her and see her  safe in the quiet boarding-place already secured for her by Mrs. Edward  Allison, to whom Elsie had written on her behalf.    Adelaide had never felt either love or respect for the ill-tempered  governess of her younger brothers and sisters, but readily undertook to do  a kindness for her child.    \"Have you the doctor's address?\" Mr. Ross asked, when taking leave of the  girl in her new quarters.    \"Yes, sir; Mrs. Travilla gave it to me on a card, and I have it safe. A  letter of introduction too, from Dr. Morton. He says he is not personally  acquainted with Dr. Thomson, but knows him well by reputation, and if  anybody can help me he can.\"    \"That is encouraging, and I hope you will have no difficulty in finding  the place. It is in the next street and only a few squares from here.\"    Sally thought she could find it readily; Mrs. Travilla had given her very  careful directions about the streets and numbers in Philadelphia; besides,  she could inquire if she were at a loss.    When Mr. Ross returned home, he brought some one with him at sight of whom  the Ion children uttered a joyous cry, and who stepping from the carriage,  caught their mother in his arms and held her to his heart, as if he meant  never to let her go.    \"Papa! papa!\" cried the children, \"we did not know you were coming; mamma  did not tell us. Mamma, did you know?\"    \"Yes, mamma had known; they saw it in her smiling eyes; and now they knew  why it was that she had watched and listened so eagerly for the coming of  the carriage; even more so than Aunt Lucy, who was expecting Uncle Philip,  and who was very fond of him too. But then he had left her only the other  day, and mamma and papa had been parted for weeks.\"    Mr. Travilla had rented a furnished cottage at Cape May and come to take  them all there. The doctors thought that would be best for Lily now.    The young folks were greatly pleased, and ready to start at once; they had  enjoyed their visit to the Crags, but had missed papa sadly, and now they  would have him with them all the time, grandpa and the whole family from  the Oaks, too; for they were occupying an adjoining cottage. And the  delicious salt sea breeze, oh, how pleasant it would be!    Mrs. Ross was sorry to part with her guests, had hoped to keep her friend  with her all summer, but a good deal comforted in her disappointment, by  the knowledge that her mother, Sophie and her children would soon take  their places.    As for young Philip he was greatly vexed and chagrined. \"It is really too  bad!\" he said seeking little Elsie out, and taking a seat by her side.    She was on the porch at some little distance from the others, and busied  in turning over the pages of a new book her papa had brought her.    \"What is too bad, Phil?\" she asked, closing it, and giving her full  attention to him.    \"That you must be hurried away so soon. I've hardly been at home two  weeks, and we hadn't seen each other before for two years.\"    \"Well a fortnight is a good while. And you will soon have your cousins  here--Herbert, Meta----\"    \"Herbert!\" he interrupted impatiently, \"who cares for him? and Meta,  prying, meddling, tell-tale Meta's worse than nobody. But there! don't  look so shocked, as if I had said an awfully wicked thing. I really don't  hate her at all, though she got me into trouble more than once with  grandma and Aunt Sophie that winter we spent at Ashlands. Ah, a bright  thought strikes me!\"    \"Indeed! may I have the benefit of it?\" asked the little girl, smiling  archly.    \"That you may. It is that you might as well stay on another week, or as  long as you will.\"    \"Thank you, but you must remember the doctor says we should go at once, on  baby's account.\"    \"I know that, but I was speaking only of you personally. Baby doesn't need  you, and papa could take you to your father and mother after a while.\"    \"Let them all go and leave me behind? Oh, Phil, I couldn't think of such a  thing!\"    The Travillas had been occupying their seaside cottage for two weeks, when  a letter came from Sally Gibson; the first she had written them, though  she had been notified at once of their change of address, told that they  would be glad to hear how she was and what Dr. Thomson thought of her  case, and a cordial invitation given her to come to them to rest and  recruit as soon as she was ready to leave her physician.    Elsie's face grew very bright as she read.    \"What does she say?\" asked her husband.    \"There is first an apology for not answering sooner (her eyes were so full  of belladonna that she could not see to put pen to paper, and she had no  one to write for her), then a burst of joy and gratitude--to God, to the  doctor and to me,--'success beyond anything she had dared to hope,' but  she will be with us to-morrow, and tell us all about it.\"    \"And she won't be blind, mamma?\" queried Violet, joyously.    \"No, dear; I think that she must mean that her eyes are cured, or her  sight made good in some way.\"    \"Oh, then, I'll just love"]]]
