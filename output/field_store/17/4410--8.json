A war had already begun in  Italy on behalf of the Duke of Nevers, who had become heir to the duchy  of Mantua, but whose family had lived in France so long that the Emperor  and the King of Spain supported a more distant claim of the Duke of  Savoy to part of the duchy, rather than admit a French prince into  Italy. Richelieu was quick to seize this pretext for attacking Spain,  for Spain was now dying into a weak power, and he saw in the war a means  of acquiring the Netherlands, which belonged to the Spanish crown. At  first nothing important was done, but the Spaniards and Germans were  worn out, while two young and able captains were growing up among the  French--the Viscount of Turenne, younger son to the Duke of Bouillon,  and the Duke of Enghien, eldest son of the Prince of Conde--and  Richelieu's policy soon secured a brilliant career of success. Elsass,  Lorraine, Artois, Catalonia, and Savoy, all fell into the hands of the  French, and from a chamber of sickness the cardinal directed the affairs  of three armies, as well as made himself feared and respected by the  whole kingdom. Cinq Mars, the last favourite he had given the king,  plotted his overthrow, with the help of the Spaniards, but was detected  and executed, when the great minister was already at death's door.  Richelieu recommended an Italian priest, Julius Mazarin, whom he had  trained to work under him, to carry on the government, and died in the  December of 1642. The king only survived him five months, dying on the  14th of May, 1643. The war was continued on the lines Richelieu had laid  down, and four days after the death of Louis XIII. the army in the Low  Countries gained a splendid victory at Rocroy, under the Duke of  Enghien, entirely destroying the old Spanish infantry. The battles of  Freiburg, Nordlingen, and Lens raised the fame of the French generals to  the highest pitch, and in 1649 reduced the Emperor to make peace in the  treaty of Muenster. France obtained as her spoil the three bishoprics,  Metz, Toul, and Verdun, ten cities in Elsass, Brisach, and the Sundgau,  with the Savoyard town of Pignerol; but the war with Spain continued  till 1659, when Louis XIV. engaged to marry Maria Theresa, a daughter of  the King of Spain.      3. The Fronde.--When an heir had long been despaired of, Anne of  Austria, the wife of Louis XIII., had become the mother of two sons, the  eldest of whom, _Louis XIV._, was only five years old at the time of his  father's death. The queen-mother became regent, and trusted entirely to  Mazarin, who had become a cardinal, and pursued the policy of Richelieu.  But what had been endured from a man by birth a French noble, was  intolerable from a low-born Italian. \"After the lion comes the fox,\" was  the saying, and the Parliament of Paris made a last stand by refusing to  register the royal edict for fresh taxes, being supported both by the  burghers of Paris, and by a great number of the nobility, who were  personally jealous of Mazarin. This party was called the Fronde, because  in their discussions each man stood forth, launched his speech, and  retreated, just as the boys did with slings (_fronde_) and stones in the  streets. The struggle became serious, but only a few of the lawyers in  the parliament had any real principle or public spirit; all the other  actors caballed out of jealousy and party spirit, making tools of \"the  men of the gown,\" whom they hated and despised, though mostly far their  superiors in worth and intelligence. Anne of Austria held fast by  Mazarin, and was supported by the Duke of Enghien, whom his father's  death had made Prince of Conde. Conde's assistance enabled her to  blockade Paris and bring the parliament to terms, which concluded the  first act of the Fronde, with the banishment of Mazarin as a peace  offering. Conde, however, became so arrogant and overbearing that the  queen caused him to be imprisoned, whereupon his wife and his other  friends began a fresh war for his liberation, and the queen was forced  to yield; but he again showed himself so tyrannical that the queen and  the parliament became reconciled and united to put him down, giving the  command of the troops to Turenne. Again there was a battle at the gates  of Paris, in which all Conde's friends were wounded, and he himself so  entirely worsted that he had to go into exile, when he entered the  Spanish service, while Mazarin returned to power at home.      4. The Court of Anne of Austria.--The court of France, though never  pure, was much improved during the reign of Louis XIII. and the regency  of Anne of Austria. There was a spirit of romance and grace about it,  somewhat cumbrous and stately, but outwardly pure and refined, and quite  a step out of the gross and open vice of the former reigns. The Duchess  de Rambouillet, a lady of great grace and wit, made her house the centre  of a brilliant society, which set itself to raise and refine the  manners, literature, and language of the time. No word that was  considered vulgar or coarse was allowed to pass muster; and though in  process of time this censorship became pedantic and petty, there is no  doubt that much was done to purify both the language and the tone of  thought. Poems, plays, epigrams, eulogiums, and even sermons were  rehearsed before the committee of taste in the Hotel de Rambouillet, and  a wonderful new stimulus was there given, not only to ornamental but to  solid literature. Many of the great men who made France illustrious were  either ending or beginning their careers at this time. Memoir writing  specially flourished, and the characters of the men and women of the  court are known to us on all sides. Cardinal de Retz and the Duke of  Rochefoucauld, both deeply engaged in the Fronde, have left, the one  memoirs, the other maxims of great power of irony. Mme. de Motteville,  one of the queen's ladies, wrote a full history of the court. Blaise  Pascal, one of the greatest geniuses of all times, was attaching  himself to the Jansenists. This religious party, so called from Jansen,  a Dutch priest, whose opinions were imputed to them, had sprung up  around the reformed convent of Port Royal, and numbered among them some  of the ablest and best men of the time; but the Jesuits considered them  to hold false doctrine, and there was a continual debate, ending at  length in the persecution of the Jansenists. Pascal's \"Provincial  Letters,\" exposing the Jesuit system, were among the ablest writings of  the age. Philosophy, poetry, science, history, art, were all making  great progress, though there was a stateliness and formality in all that  was said and done, redolent of the Spanish queen's etiquette and the  fastidious refinement of the Hotel Rambouillet.      5. Court of Louis XIV.--The attempt from the earliest times of the  French monarchy had been to draw all government into the hands of the  sovereign, and the suppression of the Fronde completed the work. Louis  XIV., though ill educated, was a man of considerable ability, much  industry, and great force of character, arising from a profound belief  that France was the first country in the world, and himself the first of  Frenchmen; and he had a magnificent courtesy of demeanour, which so  impressed all who came near him as to make them his willing slaves.  \"There is enough in him to make four kings and one respectable man  besides\" was what Mazarin said of him; and when in 1661 the cardinal  died, the king showed himself fully equal to becoming his own prime  minister. \"The State is myself,\" he said, and all centred upon him so  that no room was left for statesmen. The court was, however, in a most  brilliant state. There had been an unusual outburst of talent of every  kind in the lull after the Wars of Religion, and in generals, thinkers,  artists, and men of literature, France was unusually rich. The king had  a wonderful power of self-assertion, which attached them all to him  almost as if he were a sort of divinity. The stately, elaborate Spanish  etiquette brought in by his mother, Anne of Austria, became absolutely  an engine of government. Henry IV. had begun the evil custom of keeping  the nobles quiet by giving them situations at court, with pensions  attached, and these offices were multiplied to the most enormous and  absurd degree, so that every royal personage had some hundreds of  personal attendants. Princes of the blood and nobles of every degree  were contented to hang about the court, crowding into the most narrow  lodgings at Versailles, and thronging its anterooms; and to be ordered  to remain in the country was a most severe punishment.      6. France under Louis XIV.--There was, in fact, nothing but the chase  to occupy a gentleman on his own estate, for he was allowed no duties  or responsibilities. Each province had a governor or _intendant_, a sort  of viceroy, and the administration of the cities was managed chiefly on  the part of the king, even the mayors obtaining their posts by purchase.  The unhappy peasants had to pay in the first place the taxes to  Government, out of which were defrayed an intolerable number of  pensions, many for useless offices; next, the rents and dues which  supported their lord's expenditure at court; and, thirdly, the tithes  and fees of the clergy. Besides which, they were called off from the  cultivation of their own fields for a certain number of days to work at  the roads; their horses might be used by royal messengers; their lord's  crops had to be got in by their labour gratis, while their own were  spoiling; and, in short, the only wonder is how they existed at all.  Their hovels and their food were wretched, and any attempt to amend  their condition on the part of their lord would have been looked on as  betokening dangerous designs, and probably have landed him in the  Bastille.

He knows the country as he knows  Norfolk; he would see things!    \"His precautions here have baffled the enemy, I think.  The attempt in  the train points to an anxiety to waste no opportunity.  But whilst  Eltham was absent (he was getting his outfit in London, by the way)  they have been fixing some second string to their fiddle here.  In case  no opportunity offered before he returned, they provided for getting at  him here!\"    \"But how, Smith?\"    \"That's the mystery.  But the dead dog in the shrubbery is significant.\"    \"Do you think some emissary of Fu-Manchu is actually inside the moat?\"    \"It's impossible, Petrie.  You are thinking of secret passages, and so  forth.  There are none.  Eltham has measured up every foot of the  place.  There isn't a rathole left unaccounted for; and as for a tunnel  under the moat, the house stands on a solid mass of Roman masonry, a  former camp of Hadrian's time.  I have seen a very old plan of the  Round Moat Priory as it was called.  There is no entrance and no exit  save by the steps.  So how was the dog killed?\"    I knocked out my pipe on a bar of the grate.    \"We are in the thick of it here,\" I said.    \"We are always in the thick of it,\" replied Smith.  \"Our danger is no  greater in Norfolk than in London.  But what do they want to do?  That  man in the train with the case of instruments--WHAT instruments?  Then  the apparition of the green eyes to-night. Can they have been the eyes  of Fu-Manchu?  Is some peculiarly unique outrage contemplated--something  calling for the presence of the master?\"    \"He may have to prevent Eltham's leaving England without killing him.\"    \"Quite so.  He probably has instructions to be merciful.  But God help  the victim of Chinese mercy!\"    I went to my own room then.  But I did not even undress, refilling my  pipe and seating myself at the open window.  Having looked upon the  awful Chinese doctor, the memory of his face, with its filmed green  eyes, could never leave me.  The idea that he might be near at that  moment was a poor narcotic.    The howling and baying of the mastiff was almost continuous.    When all else in Redmoat was still the dog's mournful note yet rose on  the night with something menacing in it.  I sat looking out across the  sloping turf to where the shrubbery showed as a black island in a green  sea.  The moon swam in a cloudless sky, and the air was warm and  fragrant with country scents.    It was in the shrubbery that Denby's collie had met his mysterious  death--that the thing seen by Miss Eltham had disappeared.  What  uncanny secret did it hold?    Caesar became silent.    As the stopping of a clock will sometimes awaken a sleeper, the abrupt  cessation of that distant howling, to which I had grown accustomed, now  recalled me from a world of gloomy imaginings.    I glanced at my watch in the moonlight.  It was twelve minutes past  midnight.    As I replaced it the dog suddenly burst out afresh, but now in a tone  of sheer anger.  He was alternately howling and snarling in a way that  sounded new to me.  The crashes, as he leapt to the end of his chain,  shook the building in which he was confined.  It was as I stood up to  lean from the window and commanded a view of the corner of the house  that he broke loose.    With a hoarse bay he took that decisive leap, and I heard his heavy  body fall against the wooden wall.  There followed a strange, guttural  cry . . . and the growling of the dog died away at the rear of the house.  He was out!  But that guttural note had not come from the throat of a  dog.  Of what was he in pursuit?    At which point his mysterious quarry entered the shrubbery I do not  know.  I only know that I saw absolutely nothing, until Caesar's lithe  shape was streaked across the lawn, and the great creature went  crashing into the undergrowth.    Then a faint sound above and to my right told me that I was not the  only spectator of the scene.  I leaned farther from the window.    \"Is that you, Miss Eltham?\" I asked.    \"Oh, Dr. Petrie!\" she said.  \"I am so glad you are awake.  Can we do  nothing to help?  Caesar will be killed.\"    \"Did you see what he went after?\"    \"No,\" she called back, and drew her breath sharply.    For a strange figure went racing across the grass.  It was that of a  man in a blue dressing-gown, who held a lantern high before him, and a  revolver in his right hand.  Coincident with my recognition of Mr.  Eltham he leaped, plunging into the shrubbery in the wake of the dog.    But the night held yet another surprise; for Nayland Smith's voice came:    \"Come back!  Come back, Eltham!\"    I ran out into the passage and downstairs.  The front door was open.  A  terrible conflict waged in the shrubbery, between the mastiff and  something else.  Passing round to the lawn, I met Smith fully dressed.  He just had dropped from a first-floor window.    \"The man is mad!\" he snapped.  \"Heaven knows what lurks there!  He  should not have gone alone!\"    Together we ran towards the dancing light of Eltham's lantern.  The  sounds of conflict ceased suddenly.  Stumbling over stumps and lashed  by low-sweeping branches, we struggled forward to where the clergyman  knelt amongst the bushes.  He glanced up with tears in his eyes, as was  revealed by the dim light.    \"Look!\" he cried.    The body of the dog lay at his feet.    It was pitiable to think that the fearless brute should have met his  death in such a fashion, and when I bent and examined him I was glad to  find traces of life.    \"Drag him out.  He is not dead,\" I said.    \"And hurry,\" rapped Smith, peering about him right and left.    So we three hurried from that haunted place, dragging the dog with us.  We were not molested.  No sound disturbed the now perfect stillness.    By the lawn edge we came upon Denby, half dressed; and almost  immediately Edwards the gardener also appeared.  The white faces of the  house servants showed at one window, and Miss Eltham called to me from  her room:    \"Is he dead?\"    \"No,\" I replied; \"only stunned.\"    We carried the dog round to the yard, and I examined his head.  It had  been struck by some heavy blunt instrument, but the skull was not  broken.  It is hard to kill a mastiff.    \"Will you attend to him, Doctor?\" asked Eltham.  \"We must see that the  villain does not escape.\"    His face was grim and set.  This was a different man from the diffident  clergyman we knew:  this was \"Parson Dan\" again.    I accepted the care of the canine patient, and Eltham with the others  went off for more lights to search the shrubbery.  As I was washing a  bad wound between the mastiff's ears, Miss Eltham joined me.  It was  the sound of her voice, I think, rather than my more scientific  ministration, which recalled Caesar to life.  For, as she entered, his  tail wagged feebly, and a moment later he struggled to his feet--one of  which was injured.    Having provided for his immediate needs, I left him in charge of his  young mistress and joined the search party.  They had entered the  shrubbery from four points and drawn blank.    \"There is absolutely nothing there, and no one can possibly have left  the grounds,\" said Eltham amazedly.    We stood on the lawn looking at one another, Nayland Smith, angry but  thoughtful, tugging at the lobe of his left ear, as was his habit in  moments of perplexity.        CHAPTER IX      WITH the first coming of light, Eltham, Smith and I tested the  electrical contrivances from every point.  They were in perfect order.  It became more and more incomprehensible how anyone could have entered  and quitted Redmoat during the night.  The barbed-wire fencing was  intact, and bore no signs of having been tampered with.    Smith and I undertook an exhaustive examination of the shrubbery.    At the spot where we had found the dog, some five paces to the west of  the copper beech, the grass and weeds were trampled and the surrounding  laurels and rhododendrons bore evidence of a struggle, but no human  footprint could be found.    \"The ground is dry,\" said Smith.  \"We cannot expect much.\"    \"In my opinion,\" I said, \"someone tried to get at Caesar; his presence  is dangerous.  And in his rage he broke loose.\"    \"I think so, too,\" agreed Smith.  \"But why did this person make for  here?  And how, having mastered the dog, get out of Redmoat?  I am open  to admit the possibility of someone's getting in during the day whilst  the gates are open, and hiding until dusk.  But how in the name of all  that's wonderful does he GET OUT?  He must possess the attributes of a  bird.\"    I thought of Greba Eltham's statements, reminding my friend of her  description of the thing which she had seen passing into this strangely  haunted shrubbery.    \"That line of speculation soon takes us out of our depth, Petrie,\" he  said.  \"Let us stick to what we can understand, and that may help us to  a clearer idea of what, at present, is incomprehensible.  My view of  the case to date stands thus:    \"(1) Eltham, having rashly decided to return to the interior of China,  is warned by an official whose friendship he has won in some way to  stay in England.    \"(2) I know this official for one of the Yellow group represented in  England by Dr. Fu-Manchu.    \"(3) Several attempts, of which we know but little, to get at Eltham  are frustrated, presumably by his curious 'defenses.' An attempt in a  train fails owing to Miss Eltham's distaste for refreshment-room  coffee.  An attempt here fails owing to her insomnia.    \"(4) During Eltham's absence from Redmoat certain preparations are made  for his return.  These lead to:    \"(a) The death of Denby's collie;    \"(b) The things heard and seen by Miss Eltham;    \"(c) The things heard and seen by us all last night.    \"So that the clearing up of my fourth point--id est, the discovery of  the nature of these preparations--becomes our immediate concern.  The  prime object of these preparations, Petrie, was to enable someone to  gain "]]]
