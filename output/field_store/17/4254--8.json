My horse, _who_, under his former rider had hunted the buffalo,       seemed as much excited as myself.--IRVING.    Other examples might be quoted from Burke, Kingsley, Smollett, Scott,  Cooper, Gibbon, and others.    [Sidenote: Which.]    113. The sentences in Sec. 108 show that--    (1) _Which_ refers to animals, things, or ideas, not persons.    (2) It is not inflected for gender or number.    (3) It is nearly always third person, rarely second (an example of its  use as second person is given in sentence 32, p. 96).    (4) It has two case forms,--_which_ for the nominative and objective,  _whose_ for the possessive.    [Sidenote: _Examples of_ whose, _possessive case of_ which.]    114. Grammarians sometimes object to the statement that _whose_ is  the possessive of _which_, saying that the phrase _of which_ should  always be used instead; yet a search in literature shows that the  possessive form _whose_ is quite common in prose as well as in poetry:  for example,--         I swept the horizon, and saw at one glance the glorious       elevations, on _whose_ tops the sun kindled all the melodies and       harmonies of light.--BEECHER.         Men may be ready to fight to the death, and to persecute without       pity, for a religion _whose_ creed they do not understand, and       _whose_ precepts they habitually disobey.--MACAULAY         Beneath these sluggish waves lay the once proud cities of the       plain, _whose_ grave was dug by the thunder of the       heavens.--SCOTT.

This moribund '61, _whose_ career of life is just coming to its       terminus.--THACKERAY.    So in Matthew Arnold, Kingsley, Burke, and numerous others.    [Sidenote: Which _and its antecedents_.]    115. The last two sentences in Sec. 108 show that _which_ may have  other antecedents than nouns and pronouns. In 5 (_a_) there is a  participial adjective used as the antecedent; in 5 (_b_) there is a  complete clause employed as antecedent. This often occurs.    Sometimes, too, the antecedent follows _which_; thus,--         And, which is worse, _all you have done       Hath been but for a wayward son_.       --SHAKESPEARE.         Primarily, which is very notable and curious, I observe that _men       of business rarely know the meaning of the word \"rich_.\"--RUSKIN.         I demurred to this honorary title upon two grounds,--first, as       being one toward which I had no natural aptitudes or predisposing       advantages; secondly (which made her stare), _as carrying with it       no real or enviable distinction_.--DE QUINCEY.    [Sidenote: That.]    116. In the sentences of Sec. 109, we notice that--    (1) _That_ refers to persons, animals, and things.    (2) It has only one case form, no possessive.    (3) It is the same form for first, second, and third persons.    (4) It has the same form for singular and plural.    It sometimes borrows the possessive _whose_, as in sentence 6, Sec.  109, but this is not sanctioned as good usage.    [Sidenote: What.]    117. The sentences of Sec. 110 show that--    (1) _What_ always refers to things; is always neuter.    (2) It is used almost entirely in the singular.       1. The man _that_ hath no music in himself,...           Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.           --SHAKESPEARE  (3) Its antecedent is hardly ever expressed. When expressed, it  usually follows, and is emphatic; as, for example,--         What I would, _that_ do I not; but what I hate, _that_ do       I.--_Bible_         What fates impose, _that_ men must needs abide.--SHAKESPEARE.         What a man does, _that_ he has.--EMERSON.    Compare this:--         Alas! is _it_ not too true, what we said?--CARLYLE.        DECLENSION OF RELATIVE PRONOUNS.      118. These are the forms of the simple relatives:--                  SINGULAR AND PLURAL.      _Nom._   who    which   that   what    _Poss._  whose  whose    --     --    _Obj._   whom   which   that   what      HOW TO PARSE RELATIVES.    119. The _gender_, _number_, and _person_ of the relatives _who_,  _which_, and _that_ must be determined by those of the antecedent; the  _case_ depends upon the function of the relative in its own clause.    For example, consider the following sentence:         \"He uttered truths _that_ wrought upon and molded the lives of       those _who_ heard him.\"    Since the relatives hold the sentence together, we can, by taking them  out, let the sentence fall apart into three divisions: (1) \"He uttered  truths;\" (2) \"The truths wrought upon and molded the lives of the  people;\" (3) \"These people heard him.\"    _That_ evidently refers to _truths_, consequently is neuter, third  person, plural number. _Who_ plainly stands for _those_ or _the  people_, either of which would be neuter, third person, plural number.  Here the relative agrees with its antecedent.    We cannot say the relative agrees with its antecedent in _case_.  _Truths_ in sentence (2), above, is subject of _wrought upon and  molded_; in (1), it is object of _uttered_. In (2), _people_ is the  object of the preposition _of_; in (3), it is subject of the verb  _heard_. Now, _that_ takes the case of _the truths_ in (2), not of  _truths_ which is expressed in the sentence: consequently _that_ is in  the nominative case. In the same way _who_, standing for _the people_  understood, subject of _heard_, is in the nominative case.    Exercise.    First find the antecedents, then parse the relatives, in the following  sentences:--    1. How superior it is in these respects to the pear, whose blossoms  are neither colored nor fragrant!    2. Some gnarly apple which I pick up in the road reminds me by its  fragrance of all the wealth of Pomona.    3. Perhaps I talk with one who is selecting some choice barrels for  filling an order.    4. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.    5. Alas! it is we ourselves that are getting buried alive under this  avalanche of earthly impertinences.    6. This method also forces upon us the necessity of thinking, which  is, after all, the highest result of all education.    7. I know that there are many excellent people who object to the  reading of novels as a waste of time.    8. I think they are trying to outwit nature, who is sure to be  cunninger than they.      [Sidenote: _Parsing_ what, _the simple relative_.]    120. The relative _what_ is handled differently, because it has  usually no antecedent, but is singular, neuter, third person. Its case  is determined exactly as that of other relatives. In the sentence,  \"What can't be cured must be endured,\" the verb _must be endured_ is  the predicate of something. What must be endured? Answer, _What can't  be cured_. The whole expression is its subject. The word _what_,  however, is subject of the verb _can't be cured_, and hence is in the  nominative case.    \"What we call nature is a certain self-regulated motion or change.\"  Here the subject of _is_, etc., is _what we call nature_; but of this,  _we_ is the subject, and _what_ is the direct object of the verb  _call_, so is in the objective case.    [Sidenote: _Another way._]    Some prefer another method of treatment. As shown by the following  sentences, _what_ is equivalent to _that which_:--         It has been said that \"common souls pay with _what_ they do,       nobler souls with _that which_ they are.\"--EMERSON.         _That which_ is pleasant often appears under the name of evil;       and _what_ is disagreeable to nature is called good and       virtuous.--BURKE.    Hence some take _what_ as a double relative, and parse _that_ in the  first clause, and _which_ in the second clause; that is, \"common  souls pay with _that_ [singular, object of _with_] _which_ [singular,  object of _do_] they do.\"        INDEFINITE RELATIVES.      [Sidenote: _List and examples._]    121. INDEFINITE RELATIVES are, by meaning and use, not as direct as  the simple relatives.    They are _whoever_, _whichever_, _whatever_, _whatsoever_; less common  are _whoso_, _whosoever_, _whichsoever_, _whatsoever_. The simple  relatives _who_, _which_, and _what_ may also be used as indefinite  relatives. Examples of indefinite relatives (from Emerson):--         1. _Whoever_ has flattered his friend successfully must at once       think himself a knave, and his friend a fool.         2. It is no proof of a man's understanding, to be able to affirm       _whatever_ he pleases.         3. They sit in a chair or sprawl with children on the floor, or       stand on their head, or _what_ else _soever_, in a new and       original way.         4. _Whoso_ is heroic will always find crises to try his edge.         5. Only itself can inspire _whom_ it will.         6. God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose.       Take _which_ you please,--you cannot have both.         7. Do _what_ we can, summer will have its flies.    [Sidenote: _Meaning and use._]    122. The fitness of the term _indefinite_ here cannot be shown  better than by examining the following sentences:--         1. There is something so overruling in _whatever_ inspires us       with awe, in _all things which_ belong ever so remotely to       terror, that nothing else can stand in their presence.--BURKE.         2. Death is there associated, not with _everything that_ is most       endearing in social and domestic charities, but with _whatever_       is darkest in human nature and in human destiny.--MACAULAY.    It is clear that in 1, _whatever_ is equivalent to _all things  which_, and in 2, to _everything that_; no certain antecedent, no  particular thing, being referred to. So with the other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#12)"],[1," the Second Rhodesian Regiment saw that which will  live forever in their memories. They saw the giant ape-man pick  the heavy German from the ground and shake him as a terrier might  shake a rat--as Sabor, the lioness, sometimes shakes her prey.  They saw the eyes of the Hun bulge in horror as he vainly struck  with his futile hands against the massive chest and head of his  assailant. They saw Tarzan suddenly spin the man about and placing  a knee in the middle of his back and an arm about his neck bend  his shoulders slowly backward. The German's knees gave and he sank  upon them, but still that irresistible force bent him further and  further. He screamed in agony for a moment--then something snapped  and Tarzan cast him aside, a limp and lifeless thing.    The Rhodesians started forward, a cheer upon their lips--a cheer  that never was uttered--a cheer that froze in their throats, for  at that moment Tarzan placed a foot upon the carcass of his kill  and, raising his face to the heavens, gave voice to the weird and  terrifying victory cry of the bull ape.    Underlieutenant von Goss was dead.    Without a backward glance at the awe-struck soldiers Tarzan leaped  the trench and was gone.          Chapter V    The Golden Locket      The little British army in East Africa, after suffering severe  reverses at the hands of a numerically much superior force, was  at last coming into its own. The German offensive had been broken  and the Huns were now slowly and doggedly retreating along the  railway to Tanga. The break in the German lines had followed the  clearing of a section of their left-flank trenches of native soldiers  by Tarzan and Numa, the lion, upon that memorable night that the  ape-man had loosed a famishing man-eater among the superstitious  and terror-stricken blacks. The Second Rhodesian Regiment had  immediately taken possession of the abandoned trench and from this  position their flanking fire had raked contiguous sections of the  German line, the diversion rendering possible a successful night  attack on the part of the balance of the British forces.    Weeks had elapsed. The Germans were contesting stubbornly every  mile of waterless, thorn-covered ground and clinging desperately  to their positions along the railway. The officers of the Second  Rhodesians had seen nothing more of Tarzan of the Apes since he  had slain Underlieutenant von Goss and disappeared toward the very  heart of the German position, and there were those among them who  believed that he had been killed within the enemy lines.    \"They may have killed him,\" assented Colonel Capell; \"but I fancy  they never captured the beggar alive.\"    Nor had they, nor killed him either. Tarzan had spent those intervening  weeks pleasantly and profitably. He had amassed a considerable  fund of knowledge concerning the disposition and strength of German  troops, their methods of warfare, and the various ways in which a  lone Tarmangani might annoy an army and lower its morale.    At present he was prompted by a specific desire. There was a certain  German spy whom he wished to capture alive and take back to the  British. When he had made his first visit to German headquarters,  he had seen a young woman deliver a paper to the German general,  and later he had seen that same young woman within the British  lines in the uniform of a British officer. The conclusions were  obvious--she was a spy.    And so Tarzan haunted German headquarters upon many nights hoping  to see her again or to pick up some clew as to her whereabouts,  and at the same time he utilized many an artifice whereby he might  bring terror to the hearts of the Germans. That he was successful  was often demonstrated by the snatches of conversation he overheard as  he prowled through the German camps. One night as he lay concealed  in the bushes close beside a regimental headquarters he listened to  the conversation of several Boche officers. One of the men reverted  to the stories told by the native troops in connection with their  rout by a lion several weeks before and the simultaneous appearance  in their trenches of a naked, white giant whom they were perfectly  assured was some demon of the jungle.    \"The fellow must have been the same as he who leaped into the  general's headquarters and carried off Schneider,\" asserted one.  \"I wonder how he happened to single out the poor major. They say  the creature seemed interested in no one but Schneider. He had von  Kelter in his grasp, and he might easily have taken the general  himself; but he ignored them all except Schneider. Him he pursued  about the room, seized and carried off into the night. Gott knows  what his fate was.\"    \"Captain Fritz Schneider has some sort of theory,\" said another.  \"He told me only a week or two ago that he thinks he knows why his  brother was taken--that it was a case of mistaken identity. He was  not so sure about it until von Goss was killed, apparently by the  same creature, the night the lion entered the trenches. Von Goss was  attached to Schneider's company. One of Schneider's men was found  with his neck wrung the same night that the major was carried off  and Schneider thinks that this devil is after him and his  command--that it came for him that night and got his brother by  mistake. He says Kraut told him that in presenting the major to  Fraulein Kircher the former's name was no sooner spoken than this  wild man leaped through the window and made for him.\"    Suddenly the little group became rigid--listening. \"What was that?\"  snapped one, eyeing the bushes from which a smothered snarl had  issued as Tarzan of the Apes realized that through his mistake the  perpetrator of the horrid crime at his bungalow still lived--that  the murderer of his wife went yet unpunished.    For a long minute the officers stood with tensed nerves, every eye  riveted upon the bushes from whence the ominous sound had issued.  Each recalled recent mysterious disappearances from the heart of  camps as well as from lonely out-guards. Each thought of the silent  dead he had seen, slain almost within sight of their fellows by some  unseen creature. They thought of the marks upon dead throats--made  by talons or by giant fingers, they could not tell which--and those  upon shoulders and jugulars where powerful teeth had fastened and  they waited with drawn pistols.    Once the bushes moved almost imperceptibly and an instant later  one of the officers, without warning, fired into them; but Tarzan  of the Apes was not there. In the interval between the moving of  the bushes and the firing of the shot he had melted into the night.  Ten minutes later he was hovering on the outskirts of that part  of camp where were bivouacked for the night the black soldiers of  a native company commanded by one Hauptmann Fritz Schneider. The  men were stretched upon the ground without tents; but there were  tents pitched for the officers. Toward these Tarzan crept. It was  slow and perilous work, as the Germans were now upon the alert for  the uncanny foe that crept into their camps to take his toll by  night, yet the ape-man passed their sentinels, eluded the vigilance  of the interior guard, and crept at last to the rear of the officers'  line.    Here he flattened himself against the ground close behind the  nearest tent and listened. From within came the regular breathing  of a sleeping man--one only. Tarzan was satisfied.  With his knife  he cut the tie strings of the rear flap and entered. He made no  noise. The shadow of a falling leaf, floating gently to earth upon  a still day, could have been no more soundless. He moved to the  side of the sleeping man and bent low over him. He could not know,  of course, whether it was Schneider or another, as he had never seen  Schneider; but he meant to know and to know even more.  Gently he  shook the man by the shoulder. The fellow turned heavily and grunted  in a thick guttural.    \"Silence!\" admonished the ape-man in a low whisper. \"Silence--I  kill.\"    The Hun opened his eyes. In the dim light he saw a giant figure  bending over him. Now a mighty hand grasped his shoulder and another  closed lightly about his throat.    \"Make no outcry,\" commanded Tarzan; \"but answer in a whisper my  questions. What is your name?\"    \"Luberg,\" replied the officer. He was trembling. The weird presence  of this naked giant filled him with dread. He, too, recalled the  men mysteriously murdered in the still watches of the night camps.  \"What do you want?\"    \"Where is Hauptmann Fritz Schneider?\" asked Tarzan, \"Which is his  tent?\"    \"He is not here,\" replied Luberg. \"He was sent to Wilhelmstal  yesterday.\"    \"I shall not kill you--now,\" said the ape-man. \"First I shall go  and learn if you have lied to me and if you have your death shall  be the more terrible. Do you know how Major Schneider died?\"    Luberg shook his head negatively.    \"I do,\" continued Tarzan, \"and it was not a nice way to die--even  for an accursed German. Turn over with your face down and cover  your eyes. Do not move or make any sound.\"    The man did as he was bid and the instant that his eyes were turned  away, Tarzan slipped from the tent. An hour later he was outside  the German camp and headed for the little hill town of Wilhelmstal,  the summer seat of government of German East Africa.    Fraulein Bertha Kircher was lost. She was humiliated and angry--it  was long before she would admit it, that she, who prided herself  upon her woodcraft, was lost in this little patch of country between  the Pangani and the Tanga railway.  She knew that Wilhelmstal lay  southeast of her about fifty miles; but, through a combination of  untoward circumstances, she found herself unable to determine which  was southeast.    In the first place she had set out from German headquarters on a  well-marked road that was being traveled by troops and with every  reason to believe that she would follow that road to Wilhelmstal.  Later she"]]]
