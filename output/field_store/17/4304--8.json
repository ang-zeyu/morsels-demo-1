While consciousness is busy lighting up the  special problems of the moment, the vast mass of life's demands are  taken care of by the subconscious, which constitutes the bulk of the  mind. \"Properly speaking, the unconscious is the real psyche.\"[18]    [Footnote 18: Freud: _Interpretation of Dreams_, p. 486.]    =The Heart of Psychology.= In the face of all this, it is not to be  wondered at that the problem of the subconscious has been called not  one problem of psychology but the problem. It cannot be denied that  the discoveries which have already been made as to its activities have  been of immense practical importance in the understanding of normal  conduct and in the treatment of the psycho-neuroses.    If some of the methods--such as hypnosis, automatic writing, and  interpretation of dreams--which are used to investigate its activities  seem to savor of the charlatan and the mountebank, it is because they  have occasionally been appropriated by the ignorant and the  unscrupulous. Their real setting is the psychological laboratory and  the physician's office. In the hands of men like Sigmund Freud, Boris  Sidis, and Morton Prince, they are as scientific as the apparatus of  any other laboratory and their findings are as susceptible of proof.  We may, then, go forward with the conviction that we are walking on  solid ground and that the main paths, at least, will turn into beaten  highways.      ANCESTRAL MEMORIES    =Race-Memories.= An individual as he stands at any moment is the  product of his past,--the past which he has inherited and the past  which he has lived. In other words, he is a bundle of memories  accumulated through the experience of the race, and through his own  experience as a person. Some of these memories are conscious, and  these he calls his, while others fail to reach consciousness and are  not recognized as part of his assets.    The instincts form the starting-point of mind, conscious and  subconscious, and are the foundation upon which the rest is built.  They often show themselves as part of our conscious lives, but their  roots are laid deep in the subconscious from which they can never be  eradicated. This deepest-laid instinctive layer of the subconscious is  little subject to change. It represents the earlier adjustments of the  race, crystallized into habit. It takes no account of the differences  between the present and the past. It knows no culture, no reason, no  lately acquired prudence. It is all energy and can only wish, or urge  toward action. But since only those race-memories became instincts  which had proved needful to the race in the long run, they are on the  whole beneficent forces, working for the good of the race and the good  of the individual, if he learns how to handle them aright and to adapt  them to present conditions.    This instinctive urge toward action arouses in the individual an  organic response that is felt as a tension or craving and is mainly  dependent upon its own chemical constitution at the moment. Hunger is  the sensation caused by the little muscular contractions in the  stomach when the body is low in its food supply. Sudden fright is felt  as an all-gone sensation \"at the pit of the stomach.\" What really  happens is a tightening up of the circular muscles of the  blood-vessels lying in the network of the solar plexus, and a spasm of  the muscles of the digestive tract. The hungry stomach impels to  action until satisfied; the physical discomfort in fear impels toward  measures of safety. The apparatus that is made use of by the  subconscious in carrying out this instinctive urge is called the  autonomic nervous system.[19] It regulates all the functions of  living, not only under the stress of emotion, but during every moment  of waking or sleeping.    [Footnote 19: Kempf: \"The Tonus of Automatic Segments as a Cause of  Abnormal Behavior,\" _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_, January,  1921.]    =A Capable Manager.= The conscious mind could not possibly send  messages to the numerous glands that fit the body for action, nor  attend to all the delicate adjustments that enter into the process.  The conscious mind in most of us does not even know of the existence  of the organs and secretions involved, but something sends the  messages and it is something that has a remarkable likeness to mind as  we usually think of mind,--something which takes advantage of the past  and gages means to an end with a nicety that excites our wonder.    =Take no Anxious Thought.= We take food into our stomachs and forget  about it, if we are wise; and this subconscious overseer who through  millions of years of experience has learned how to digest food does  the rest. As with digestion, so with our heart-action; we lie down at  night fairly sure that there will be no break in the regular rhythm of  its beat. The subconscious overseer is \"on the job\" and he never  rests. No matter how hard we sleep, he never lets us forget to take a  breath; and if we trust him, he is very likely to wake us up at the  appointed time in the morning. Also, if we trust him, he carries us  off to sleep as though we were babies. Has he not had long practice in  the days before insomnia was invented?    =First Aid to the Injured.= In times of infection or injury, this  subconscious manager is better than any doctor. The doctors say with  truth that they only assist nature. If the infection is internal,  antitoxins are produced within the body. If the injury is external,  like a cut, the messages fly, and white blood-corpuscles are marshaled  to take care of poisons and build up the tissue. If the injury is of  the kind that needs rest, the subconscious doctor knows it. He  therefore causes pain and rigidity, in order to induce us to hold the  injured part still until it is restored.    Crile reminds us of a fact that is often noticed by surgeons. If  patients under ether are handled roughly, especially in the intestinal  region, respiration quickens and there are tremors and even convulsive  efforts which interfere with the surgeon's work. The conscious mind  cannot feel. It is asleep. But the subconscious mind, whose business  it is to protect the body, is trying to get away from injury. The body  uses up as much energy as though it had run for miles, and when the  patient wakes up, we say that he is suffering from shock. The  subconscious mind which is not affected by ether, has been exhausting  itself in a vain attempt to get the body away from harm.    =A Tireless Servant.= When the conscious mind undertakes a job, it is  always more or less subject to fatigue. But the subconscious after its  long practice seems never to tire. We say that its activities have  become automatic. With all its inherited skill, the subconscious, if  left to itself, can be depended upon to run the bodily machinery  without effort and without hitch. The only things that can interfere  with its work are the wrong kind of emotions and the wrong kind of  suggestions from the conscious mind. Barring these, it goes its way  like a trusty servant, looking after details and leaving its master's  mind free for other things. Having been \"in the family\" for  generations, it knows its business and resents any interference with  its duties or any infringement of its rights.    No man, then, comes into this world without inheritance: he receives  from his ancestors two goodly sets of heirlooms, the instincts and the  mechanism which carries on bodily functions. This is the capital with  which man starts life; but immediately he begins increasing this  capital, adding memories from his own experience to the accumulated  race-records.      PERSONAL MEMORIES    No more startling secret has been unearthed by science than the  discovery of the length and minuteness of our memories. No matter how  much one may think he has forgotten, the tablets of his mind are  closely written with records of infinitesimal experiences, shadowy  sensations, old happenings which the conscious self has lost entirely  and would scarcely recognize as its own. Many of these brain records,  or neurograms, as Prince calls them, are never aroused from their  dormant conditions. But others, aroused by emotion or association of  ideas, may after years of inactivity, come forth again either as  conscious memories or as subconscious forces, or even as physiological  memories,--bodily repetitions of the pains, palpitations, and tremors  of old emotional experiences.    =Irresistible Childhood.= An experience that is forgotten is not  necessarily lost. Although the first few years of childhood are lost  to conscious memory, these years outweigh all others in their  influence on character. The Jesuit priest was right when he said,  \"Give me a child until he is six years old, and he will be a Catholic  all his life.\" As Frink has so ably shown, the determining factors  that enter into any adult choice, such as the choice of the Catholic  or the Protestant faith, are in a large measure made up of  subconscious memories from early childhood, forgotten memories of  Sunday-school and church, of lessons at home or passages in  books,--experiences which no voluntary effort could recall, but which  still live unrecognized in our mature judgments and beliefs. Naturally  we do not acknowledge these subconscious motives. We like to believe  that all our decisions are based on reason, and so we invent plausible  arguments for our attitudes and our actions, arguments which we  ourselves implicitly believe. This process of substituting a plausible  reason for a subconscious one is known as rationalization, a process  which every one of us engages in many times a day.    It is indeed true that the child is father to the man. Those first  impressionable years, when we believed implicitly whatever any one  told us and when through ignorance we reacted emotionally to ordinary  experiences, are molding us still, making us the men and women we are  to-day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#12)"],[1,"uired, even though they are not  sensible of it. For although there be nothing in glory to make it  desirable, yet it follows virtue as its shadow; and the genuine  judgment of the multitude on good men, if ever they form any, is more  to their own praise than of any real advantage to the dead. Yet I  cannot say, however it may be received, that Lycurgus and Solon have no  glory from their laws, and from the political constitution which they  established in their country; or that Themistocles and Epaminondas have  not glory from their martial virtue.    XLVI. For Neptune shall sooner bury Salamis itself with his waters than  the memory of the trophies gained there; and the Boeotian Leuctra shall  perish sooner than the glory of that great battle. And longer still  shall fame be before it deserts Curius, and Fabricius, and Calatinus,  and the two Scipios, and the two Africani, and Maximus, and Marcellus,  and Paulus, and Cato, and Laelius, and numberless other heroes; and  whoever has caught any resemblance of them, not estimating it by common  fame, but by the real applause of good men, may with confidence, when  the occasion requires, approach death, on which we are sure that even  if the chief good is not continued, at least no evil is. Such a man  would even wish to die while in prosperity; for all the favors that  could be heaped on him would not be so agreeable to him as the loss of  them would be painful. That speech of the Lacedaemonian seems to have  the same meaning, who, when Diagoras the Rhodian, who had himself been  a conqueror at the Olympic games, saw two of his own sons conquerors  there on the same day, approached the old man, and, congratulating him,  said, \"You should die now, Diagoras, for no greater happiness can  possibly await you.\" The Greeks look on these as great things; perhaps  they think too highly of them, or, rather, they did so then. And so he  who said this to Diagoras, looking on it as something very glorious,  that three men out of one family should have been conquerors there,  thought it could answer no purpose to him to continue any longer in  life, where he could only be exposed to a reverse of fortune.    I might have given you a sufficient answer, as it seems to me, on this  point, in a few words, as you had allowed the dead were not exposed to  any positive evil; but I have spoken at greater length on the subject  for this reason, because this is our greatest consolation in the losing  and bewailing of our friends. For we ought to bear with moderation any  grief which arises from ourselves, or is endured on our own account,  lest we should seem to be too much influenced by self-love. But should  we suspect our departed friends to be under those evils, which they are  generally imagined to be, and to be sensible of them, then such a  suspicion would give us intolerable pain; and accordingly I wished, for  my own sake, to pluck up this opinion by the roots, and on that account  I have been perhaps somewhat more prolix than was necessary.    XLVII. _A._ More prolix than was necessary? Certainty not, in my  opinion. For I was induced, by the former part of your speech, to wish  to die; but, by the latter, sometimes not to be unwilling, and at  others to be wholly indifferent about it. But the effect of your whole  argument is, that I am convinced that death ought not to be classed  among the evils.    _M._ Do you, then, expect that I am to give you a regular peroration,  like the rhetoricians, or shall I forego that art?    _A._ I would not have you give over an art which you have set off to  such advantage; and you were in the right to do so, for, to speak the  truth, it also has set you off. But what is that peroration? For I  should be glad to hear it, whatever it is.    _M._ It is customary, in the schools, to produce the opinions of the  immortal Gods on death; nor are these opinions the fruits of the  imagination alone of the lecturers, but they have the authority of  Herodotus and many others. Cleobis and Biton are the first they  mention, sons of the Argive priestess; the story is a well-known one.  As it was necessary that she should be drawn in a chariot to a certain  annual sacrifice, which was solemnized at a temple some considerable  distance from the town, and the cattle that were to draw the chariot  had not arrived, those two young men whom I have just mentioned,  pulling off their garments, and anointing their bodies with oil,  harnessed themselves to the yoke. And in this manner the priestess was  conveyed to the temple; and when the chariot had arrived at the proper  place, she is said to have entreated the Goddess to bestow on them, as  a reward for their piety, the greatest gift that a God could confer on  man. And the young men, after having feasted with their mother, fell  asleep; and in the morning they were found dead. Trophonius and  Agamedes are said to have put up the same petition, for they, having  built a temple to Apollo at Delphi, offered supplications to the God,  and desired of him some extraordinary reward for their care and labor,  particularizing nothing, but asking for whatever was best for men.  Accordingly, Apollo signified to them that he would bestow it on them  in three days, and on the third day at daybreak they were found dead.  And so they say that this was a formal decision pronounced by that God  to whom the rest of the deities have assigned the province of divining  with an accuracy superior to that of all the rest.    XLVIII. There is also a story told of Silenus, who, when taken prisoner  by Midas, is said to have made him this present for his ransom--namely,  that he informed him[25] that never to have been born was by far the  greatest blessing that could happen to man; and that the next best  thing was to die very soon; which very opinion Euripides makes use of  in his Cresphontes, saying,        When man is born, 'tis fit, with solemn show,      We speak our sense of his approaching woe;      With other gestures and a different eye,      Proclaim our pleasure when he's bid to die.[26]    There is something like this in Crantor's Consolation; for he says that  Terinaesus of Elysia, when he was bitterly lamenting the loss of his  son, came to a place of divination to be informed why he was visited  with so great affliction, and received in his tablet these three  verses:        Thou fool, to murmur at Euthynous' death!      The blooming youth to fate resigns his breath:      The fate, whereon your happiness depends,      At once the parent and the son befriends.[27]    On these and similar authorities they affirm that the question has been  determined by the Gods. Nay, more; Alcidamas, an ancient rhetorician of  the very highest reputation, wrote even in praise of death, which he  endeavored to establish by an enumeration of the evils of life; and his  Dissertation has a great deal of eloquence in it; but he was  unacquainted with the more refined arguments of the philosophers. By  the orators, indeed, to die for our country is always considered not  only as glorious, but even as happy: they go back as far as  Erechtheus,[28] whose very daughters underwent death, for the safety of  their fellow-citizens: they instance Codrus, who threw himself into the  midst of his enemies, dressed like a common man, that his royal robes  might not betray him, because the oracle had declared the Athenians  conquerors, if their king was slain. Menoeceus[29] is not overlooked by  them, who, in compliance with the injunctions of an oracle, freely shed  his blood for his country. Iphigenia ordered herself to be conveyed to  Aulis, to be sacrificed, that her blood might be the cause of spilling  that of her enemies.    XLIX. From hence they proceed to instances of a fresher date. Harmodius  and Aristogiton are in everybody's mouth; the memory of Leonidas the  Lacedaemonian and Epaminondas the Theban is as fresh as ever. Those  philosophers were not acquainted with the many instances in our  country--to give a list of whom would take up too much time--who, we  see, considered death desirable as long as it was accompanied with  honor. But, notwithstanding this is the correct view of the case, we  must use much persuasion, speak as if we were endued with some higher  authority, in order to bring men to begin to wish to die, or cease to  be afraid of death. For if that last day does not occasion an entire  extinction, but a change of abode only, what can be more desirable? And  if it, on the other hand, destroys, and absolutely puts an end to us,  what can be preferable to the having a deep sleep fall on us, in the  midst of the fatigues of life, and being thus overtaken, to sleep to  eternity? And, should this really be the case, then Ennius's language  is more consistent with wisdom than Solon's; for our Ennius says,        Let none bestow upon my passing bier      One needless sigh or unavailing tear.    But the wise Solon says,        Let me not unlamented die, but o'er my bier      Burst forth the tender sigh, the friendly tear.[30]    But let us, if indeed it should be our fate to know the time which is  appointed by the Gods for us to die, prepare ourselves for it with a  cheerful and grateful mind, thinking ourselves like men who are  delivered from a jail, and released from their fetters, for the purpose  of going back to our eternal habitation, which may be more emphatically  called our own; or else to be divested of all sense and trouble. If, on  the other hand, we should have no notice given us of this decree, yet  let us cultivate such a disposition as to look on that formidable hour  of death as happy for us, though shocking to our friends; and let us  never imagine anything to be an evil which is an appointment of the  immortal Gods, or of nature, the common parent of all. For it is not by  hazard or without design that we have been born and situated as we  have. On the contrary, beyond all doubt there is a certain power which"]]]
