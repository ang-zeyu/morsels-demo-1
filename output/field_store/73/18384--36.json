A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#4)"],[1,"many  leaders of ward politics and volunteer fire companies, and from which  Lew Baker and his victim, Bill Poole, \"The Paudeen,\" \"Reddy, the  Blacksmith,\" and numerous others were afterwards developed; but they  were oftener far more guilty than the real criminals, for they aided and  abetted, and in cases of arrest befriended them, causing their  subsequent escape from the penalties justly due for their crimes.    As a type of the veritable \"Bowery Boy\" may be taken the leader of that  gang of notorious \"toughs,\" one who, from his well-earned reputation as  a bar-room and street rough-and-tumble fighter, has become a historical  personage, under the sobriquet of \"Mose.\" His faithful lieutenant,  \"Syksey,\" of \"hold de butt\" fame, will not soon be forgotten either, as  both figured prominently in the terrible pitched battles the two rival  gangs frequently indulged in, to the terror and consternation of all New  York. Of the rival mob, known as \"Dead Rabbits,\" Kit Burns, Tommy Hedden  and \"Shang\" Allen are names long to be remembered by the terror-stricken  citizens who lived in the days when the fights between these notorious  aspirants for pugilistic and bloody honors were often of the deadliest  and most sanguinary character, lasting for days at a time; when entire  streets were blockaded and barricaded, and the mobs were armed with  pistols and rifles. Even cannons were sometimes used, and the police,  even when aided by the military, were powerless to suppress these  battles until many were killed and wounded on both sides. In these  desperate conflicts it was no unusual sight to see women, side by side  with men, fighting as valiantly as their husbands, sons or fathers, and  the records of the courts and prisons of those days tell dreadful  stories of murders, robberies and other crimes done under cover of these  periodical street fights.    At this time the locality known as the \"Five Points\" was probably the  worst spot on the face of the civilized globe. In and around it  centered, perhaps, the most villainous and desperate set of savage human  beings ever known to the criminal annals of a great city. To pass  through it in daylight was attended by considerable danger, even when  accompanied by several officers of the law. Woe to the unfortunate  individual who chanced to stray into this neighborhood after dark. A  knock on the head, a quick rifling of pockets, a stab if the victim  breathed, a push down some dark cellar, were frequently the skeleton  outlines of many a dreadful tragedy, of which the victim was never  afterwards heard. The name \"Five Points,\" was given to that particular  spot formed by the junction or crossing of Worth, Baxter and Park  streets, but nearly embraced all the neighborhood comprised in the  locality bounded by Centre, Chatham, Pearl and Canal streets in the  Sixth ward, and was frequently afterwards mentioned as the \"Bloody  Sixth,\" from the many daily conflicts eventuating there.    The \"Five Points,\" from being the hiding-place and residence of the most  bloodthirsty set of criminals, vagabonds and cut-throats, has, through  the influence of the Five Points Mission House and the gradual  encroachments of business houses, become quite respectable, and while  now sheltering a large number of the foreign element, has ceased, to a  great extent, to longer excite terror in the community. Still, it has  not entirely lost its former well-merited title of \"Thieves' Nest.\" It  is comparatively a safe thoroughfare in daylight, and after dark, if one  is on constant guard, he may safely pass unharmed.    In the Fourth ward, just beyond the locality written about, was another  terrible rendezvous for an equally desperate set of men. It was known as  Slaughter-house Point, and a criminal here was, for a time, safe from  the police, as its many intricate streets and tumble-down houses offered  a safe hiding-place for every kind of outlaw, even up to very recent  years. Here the terrible garroter dwelt for a long time; aye, and  throve, too, until our criminal judges began sentencing every one of  them convicted before them to the extreme penalty of twenty years in  Sing Sing, which largely suppressed that class of criminals in this  city.    The methods of the garroter were quick, sure and silent. At  Slaughter-house Point and its environs many a returned East India sea  captain, whose vessel was moored to one of the docks at the foot of a  contiguous street, has either strayed or been beguiled into this  neighborhood, drugged and robbed. Others, whose business or chance  brought them within the reach of this set of desperadoes, have fared  similarly. Sad has been the fate of many an individual unfortunately  falling into the clutches of these murderous villains. A stealthy step,  an arm thrown under the chin of the unsuspecting victim, a bear-like  clasp, and total unconsciousness. To rifle the pockets of the unlucky  man--sometimes stripping him and throwing him off the dock--and escape  into one of the many dark and dismal passages abounding in the  neighborhood, was but a few minutes' work, and nothing remained to tell  how the drama, perhaps tragedy, was enacted.    Another class of dangerous criminals haunted the precincts of Water and  Cherry streets, and that immediate locality. They were all frequenters  of the well-known establishments presided over by such eminent lights of  the profession as Kit Burns, Jerry McAuley, Johnny Allen, etc., but all  three of whom afterwards forswore their evil ways and died in the odor  of piety.    These various gangs inhabiting the portions of the city already  indicated were eventually succeeded by others in widely separated  localities. The succeeding gangs were quite as numerous, but not quite  as ferocious or formidable, so far as numbers were concerned, but more  dangerous and daring individually; for while the former type lived in  communities by themselves, and dwelt in certain well-known streets and  houses, using their bloodthirsty propensities occasionally against  themselves in their street fights, the latter at all times waged an  indiscriminate and perpetual war on the respectable element of society.  To the latter and more modern gangs, which were really worse, so far as  the higher classes of crimes were concerned, belonged such men as  \"Reddy, the Blacksmith,\" \"Dutch Heinrich.\" Chauncey Johnson, \"Johnny,  the Mick,\" and their favorite places were \"Murderers' Row,\" and other  notorious localities on Broadway, Houston, Crosby and adjacent streets.    The war did much to bring these latter into prominence. They made money  when money was in the hands of every one, when bounty-jumpers were as  thick as berries on the bushes, and the leading streets of the city were  a blaze of light at night, from the myriads of colored lamps displayed  by the pretty waiter-girl saloons and other notorious and questionable  dives. When the war ceased these and kindred gangs of \"toughs\" were  again superseded by those at present to be found in various parts of the  metropolis, but which, thanks to an excellent system of police, are all  or nearly all under complete espionage of the local authorities.    It now becomes our duty, as faithful chroniclers, to point out the  localities at present occupied by that class of the population, and tell  the secret of their lives and how they exist. The region which most  engrosses the attention of the police is that conspicuously known as  \"Mackerelville,\" which for some years past has borne rather an unsavory  reputation. While there are many deserving and worthy persons dwelling  in the locality, quite a different type of humanity also makes its home  there. The neighborhood in question is comprised in Eleventh, Twelfth  and Thirteenth streets, and First avenue, and Avenues A, B and C. It  harbors a wild gang of lawbreakers, ready and willing to commit any kind  of lawless act, in which the chances of escape are many and detection  slight. Notwithstanding the decimation of its ranks by frequent and  well-deserved trips to the penitentiary of its members, for every crime  from murder down, it appears to survive, to the terror of the  respectable poor living in the neighborhood and the constant dread of  the police officer. It is a locality and a gang much dreaded at night,  but not nearly so much now as formerly, for when a member commits a  crime of any importance now he is invariably ferreted out, arrested and  punished.    The Tenth Avenue gang is a chance affair, owing its existence to the  successful and bold express robbery occurring some years ago, but which  is still fresh in the minds of most people from the skillful manner in  which it was executed, and from the number of prominent rascals  participating in it. The robbery referred to, at the time of its  occurrence, was current talk, and continued a subject of conversation  for many weeks afterwards. A number of ingenious, daring and  highly-cultured train robbers, under the leadership of the notorious Ike  Marsh, among whom was one who has since attained celebrity as an actor,  boarded a train on the Hudson River Railroad, near Spuyten Duyvil, the  spot immortalized by Washington Irving, and, entering the express car,  bound and gagged the messenger in charge, threw the safe off and jumped  after it. The iron box contained a large amount of greenbacks and  government bonds, which the thieves succeeded in appropriating. Some of  these daring robbers were subsequently arrested and lodged in the White  Plains jail, but on the day set for the trial, the sheriff discovered  that his prisoners of the night before, whom he imagined quite secure,  had left, without waiting to say good-bye. Some friends and confederates  came to their assistance, released them and drove them down to the city,  from whence they finally reached our sister Kingdom, recently made  famous as the abode of the fashionable defaulter.    The successful perpetration of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#4)"],[1,"that  is known in the history of art.    Nikomachos, who lived at Thebes about 360 B.C., was famous for  the rapidity with which he painted pictures that were excellent in their  completeness and beauty. Aristides, the son or brother of Nikomachos, was  so good an artist that Attalus, king of Pergamos, offered more than twenty  thousand pounds, or about one hundred thousand dollars, for his picture of  Dionysus, or Bacchus. This wonderful picture was carried to Rome, and  preserved in the temple of Ceres; but it no longer exists. Euphranor was  another great painter, and was distinguished for his power to give great  expression to the faces and a manly force to the figures which he painted.    Nikias, the Athenian, is said to have been so devoted to his art that he  could think of nothing else: he would ask his servants if he had bathed or  eaten, not being able to remember for himself. He was very rich, and when  King Ptolemy of Egypt offered him more than sixty thousand dollars for his  picture of Ulysses in the under-world, he refused this great sum, and gave  the painting to his native city. Nikias seems to have greatly exalted and  respected his art, for he contended that painters should not fritter away  time and talent on insignificant subjects, but ought rather to choose some  grand event, such as a battle or a sea-fight. His figures of women and his  pictures of animals, especially those of dogs, were much praised. Some of  his paintings were encaustic, that is to say, the colors were burned in;  thus they must have been made on plaster or pottery of some sort. Nikias  outlived Alexander the Great, and saw the beginning of the school of  painters to which the great Apelles belonged--that which is called the  Hellenic school, in which Greek art reached its highest point.    Apelles was the greatest of all Greek painters. He was born at Kolophon;  but as he made his first studies at Ephesus he has been called an  Ephesian: later he studied in the school of Sikyon, but even when a pupil  there he was said to be the equal of all his instructors. Philip of  Macedon heard of his fame, and persuaded Apelles to remove to his capital  city, which was called Pella. While there Apelles became the friend of the  young Alexander, and when the latter came to the throne he made Apelles  his court-painter, and is said to have issued an edict forbidding all  other artists from painting his portrait. Later on Apelles removed to  Ephesus.    During the early part of his artistic life Apelles did little else than  paint such pictures as exalted the fame of Philip, and afterward that of  Alexander. He painted many portraits of both these great men; for one of  Alexander he received nearly twenty-five thousand dollars; in it the  monarch was represented as grasping the thunderbolt, as Jupiter might have  done, and the hand appeared to be stretched out from the picture. This  portrait was in the splendid temple of Diana, or Artemis, at Ephesus.  Alexander was accustomed to say of it, \"There are two Alexanders, one  invincible, the living son of Philip--the other immutable, the picture of  Apelles.\"    Later in his life Apelles painted many pictures of mythological subjects.  He visited Alexandria, in Egypt; he did not win the favor of King Ptolemy,  and his enemies in the Egyptian court played cruel practical jokes upon  him. On one occasion he received an invitation to a feast at which the  king had not desired his presence. The monarch was angry; but Apelles told  him the truth, and appeased his wrath by sketching on the wall the exact  likeness of the servant who had carried the invitation to him. However,  Ptolemy remained unfavorable to him, and Apelles painted a great picture,  called Calumny, in which he represented those who had been his enemies,  and thus held them up to the scorn of the world. Apelles visited Rhodes  and Athens, but is thought to have died in the island of Kos, where he had  painted two very beautiful pictures of the goddess Venus. One of these is  called the Venus Anadyomene, or Venus rising from the sea. The emperor  Augustus carried this picture to Rome, and placed so high a value on it  that he lessened the tribute-money of the people of Kos a hundred talents  on account of it. This sum was about equal to one hundred thousand dollars  of our money.    The art of Apelles was full of grace and sweetness, and the finish of his  pictures was exquisite. The saying, \"leave off in time,\" originated in his  criticism of Protogenes, of whom he said that he was his superior except  that he did not know when to leave off, and by too much finishing lessened  the effect of his work. Apelles was modest and generous: he was the first  to praise Protogenes, and conferred a great benefit upon the latter by  buying up his pictures, and giving out word that he was going to sell them  as his own. Apelles was never afraid to correct those who were ignorant,  and was equally ready to learn from any one who could teach him anything.  It is said that on one occasion, when Alexander was in his studio, and  talked of art, Apelles advised him to be silent lest his color-grinder  should laugh at him. Again, when he had painted a picture, and exposed it  to public view, a cobbler pointed out a defect in the shoe-latchet;  Apelles changed it, but when the man next proceeded to criticise the leg  of the figure, Apelles replied, \"Cobbler, stick to your last.\" These  sayings have descended to our own day, and have become classical. All  these anecdotes from so remote a time are in a sense doubtful; but they  are very interesting--young people ought to be familiar with them, but it  is also right to say that they are not known to be positively true.    Protogenes of Rhodes, to whom Apelles was so friendly, came to be thought  a great painter. It is said that when Demetrius made war against Rhodes  the artist did not trouble himself to leave his house, which was in the  very midst of the enemy's camp. When questioned as to his fearlessness he  replied, \"Demetrius makes war against the Rhodians, and not against the  Arts.\" It is also said that after hearing of this reply Demetrius  refrained from burning the town, in order to preserve the pictures of  Protogenes.    The ancient writers mention many other Greek painters, but none as  important as those of whom we have spoken. Greek painting never reached a  higher point than it had gained at the beginning of the Hellenistic age.  Every kind of painting except landscape-painting had been practised by  Greek artists; but that received no attention until figure-painting had  declined. Vitruvius mentions that the ancients had some very important  wall-paintings consisting of simple landscapes, and that others had  landscape backgrounds with figures illustrating scenes from the poems of  Homer. But we have no reason to believe that Greek landscape-painting was  ever more than scenic or decorative work, and thus fell far short of what  is now the standard for such painting.    The painting of the early Romans was principally derived from or through  the early Etruscans, and the Etruscans are believed to have first learned  their art from Greek artists, who introduced plastic art into Italy as  early as B.C. 655, when Demaratus was expelled from Corinth--and later,  Etruscan art was influenced by the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia. So it  is fair to say that Etruscan art and early Roman art were essentially  Greek art. The earliest artists who are known to have painted in Rome had  Greek names, such as Ekphantos, Damophilos, and Gargasos. Later on in  history there are painters mentioned with Latin names, but there is little  of interest related concerning them; in truth, Ludius (who is also called  by various authors Tadius and Studius) is the only really interesting  ancient Roman painter of whom we know. He lived in the time of Augustus,  and Pliny said of him: \"Ludius, too, who lived in the age of the divine  Augustus, must not be cheated of his fame. He was the first to bring in a  singularly delightful fashion of wall-painting--villas, colonnades,  examples of landscape-gardening, woods and sacred groves, reservoirs,  straits, rivers, coasts, all according to the heart's desire--and amidst  them passengers of all kinds on foot, in boats, driving in carriages, or  riding on asses to visit their country properties; furthermore fishermen,  bird-catchers, hunters, vintagers; or, again, he exhibits stately villas,  to which the approach is through a swamp, with men staggering under the  weight of the frightened women whom they have bargained to carry on their  shoulders; and many another excellent and entertaining device of the same  kind. The same artist also set the fashion of painting views--and that  wonderfully cheap--of seaside towns in broad daylight.\"    We cannot think that Ludius was the first painter, though he may have been  the first Roman painter, who made this sort of pictures, and he probably  is the only one of whose work any part remains. Brunn and other good  authorities believe that the wall-painting of Prima Porta, in Rome, was  executed by Ludius. It represents a garden, and covers the four walls of a  room. It is of the decorative order of painting, as Pliny well understood,  for he speaks of the difference between the work of Ludius and that of  the true artists who painted panel pictures and not wall-paintings. After  the time of Ludius we can give no trustworthy account of any fine, Roman  painter.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--ETRUSCAN WALL-PAINTING.]    The works of the ancient painters which still remain in various countries  are wall-paintings, paintings on vases, mosaics, paintings on stone, and  certain so-called miniatures; and besides these principal works there are  many small articles, such as mirrors, toilet-cases, and other useful  objects, which are decorated in colors.    We will first speak of the mural, or wall-paintings, as they are the"]]]
