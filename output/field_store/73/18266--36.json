He growl an' ax um what dey doin', an' when  Brer Rabbit tell 'im, he say dat's what he long been needin'. 'How does  you git in?' 'Des back right in,' sez ol' Brer Rabbit, sezee, an' wid  dat,    [Illustration]    \"Mr. Lion backed in, an' de water wuz so hot, he try fer ter git out,  an' he slipped in plum ter his shoulder-blades. You kin b'lieve me er  not, but dat creetur wuz scall'd so dat he holler'd an' skeer'd  eve'ybody fur miles aroun'.    [Illustration]    \"An when he come out, all de wool drap't out, 'cep' de bunch you see on  his neck, an' de leetle bit you'll fin' on de een' er his tail--an'  dat'd 'a' come off ef de tail hadn't 'a' slipped thoo de bung-hole er de  barrel.\" With that, Uncle Remus closed his eyes, but not so tightly that  he couldn't watch the little boy. For a moment the child said nothing,  and then, \"I must tell that tale to mother before I forget it!\" So  saying, he ran out of the cabin as fast as his feet could carry him,  leaving Uncle Remus shaking with laughter.          HOW BRER RABBIT GOT A HOUSE          [Illustration]        Oh, once 'pon a time, all de creeturs, all de creeturs,          Tuck a notion dat dey'd build a house,      An' fix it so ez ter keep out de skeeters,          An' fix it up nix cummy rous!

Dey buil' de house, an' it sho wuz a fine un,          Made er poplar, oak an' pine;      De littlest room wuz a sev'm-by-nine un,          Whar de sick could go an' whine!        [Illustration]        Brer Rabbit, he wait, an' when de time come          He choosened a upsta's room,      An' dar he sot (ef I kin make de rhyme come)          A-singin' \"Hark fum de Toom\"!      An' den he got what he aint had oughter,          Ez all de creeturs said,      A gun, a cannon, an' a tub er water,          An' hid um under his bed!

An' likewise one er Brer B'ar's!        [Illustration]        Brer Rabbit say, \"When I sneeze I'll skeer you,          An' I hate fer ter have it ter do!\"      Brer Fox say, \"We'll lissen an' hear you          Des go right ahead wid yo' sneeze-a-ma-roo!\"      Boom-a-lam! went de cannon, an' de creeturs, dey lit out          Thoo window-sash an' do'      Any way, any way dat dey kin git oot,          An' dey aint come dar no mo'!

An' what's de matter wid Miss Bob White,      Dat she choke herse'f wid sayin' Good-night?      You know mighty well dat sump'n is wrong      When dey sets an' sings dat kinder song,      'Twix' a call an' a cry, 'twix' a weep an' a wail--      Dey must be tellin' a mighty sad tale.

[Illustration]        She'd make her house facin' eas' an' wes',      An' den wid eggs she'd fill her nes';      Fer ter keep um warm she'd brood an' set,      An' keep her house fum gittin' wet.      Whiles dis gwine on, Brer Rabbit come by,      A-wigglin' his mouf, an' a-blinkin' his eye:      \"De top er de mornin', Miss Bob,\" sezee;      \"De same ter you, Brer Rabbit,\" se' she.

De only thing I want is ter wash my dress,      But I can't do dat whiles I'm on my nes'.\"        [Illustration]        Brer Rabbit, he say, \"Can't I he'p you out?      I ain't doin' nothin' but walkin' about,      An' my ol' 'oman is willin' fer ter bet      Dat ef settin 's de thing, I'm ol' man Set!\"      \"I know mighty well,\" sez Miss Bob White,      \"Ef you set a-tall, it'll be done right.\"      \"Thanky-do, Miss Bob! Go wash yo' dress,      An' I'll do what I kin fer ter kivver yo' nes'!\"        [Illustration]        So off she put, wid a flutter an' a flirt,      An' washed her dress in a pile er clean dirt;      Brer Rabbit see de eggs, an' shuck his head;      His mouf 'gun ter dribble, an' his eye turn red;      Sezee, \"It'd sholy be hard fer ter match um,      So I'll des take um home an' try fer ter hatch um!\"      So said, so done! An' den when he come back,      He come in a gait 'twix' a lope an' a rack.        [Illustration]        An' Miss Bob White, atter washin' her dress,      Went a-runnin' back ter house an' nes';      \"Much erbleege, Brer Rabbit,\" an' den she bowed.      \"Say nothin', ma'am, fer ter make me proud,      Kaze I been a-waitin' here, frettin' an' sweatin',      Fer fear I ain't sech a good han' at settin';      My ol' 'oman say I got a slow fever,      An' I 'clar' ter goodness, I'm ready ter b'lieve her!

In the eyes of one  appeared the dreams of centuries; beaming from the eyes of the other was  the fun of the ages.    \"Did any of you people, aside from Jack, see the suffragette parade  to-day?\" asked Frank, with laughing eyes fixed upon his brother.    \"I--how do you know I saw it?\" asked John, and his confused manner  brought \"Eh, Jack?\" from the other two.    \"It's all right, Jack; I won't tell Leonora, but how jealous she would  be if she could have seen you following the banner carried by those  three pretty girls,\" answered Frank. \"Why, I followed you a dozen blocks  myself, almost touching you the whole time, just to see which one of the  three girls was making you join the parade. The next time get right out  into the street, old man, and don't block the view of us spectators, for  you know you were a part of that parade to-day, in mind at least.\"    The absurdity of the scene as depicted by Frank made even John throw  back his head and join in the unrestrained laughter of the others.    \"I was in the Waldorf-Astoria at a tea-table near the window when the  head of the column came in view. I, too, liked the looks of those pretty  girls carrying the banner, but before I could decide which one I liked  best, my dearly beloved brother hove in sight, with eyes glued on the  third one, wandering down the Avenue like either a slow-hatching lunatic  or a good subject for a hypnotist. I knew Jack would need me in New York  to steer him right until all that Indian mysticism gets out of his  system, and that is the reason I left the delights of the wilds for the  barbarism of the city. Well, I excused myself and hurried out to take  possession of Jack, but when I got close to him and was just about to  slap him on the shoulder, I followed his eyes--and for the life of me, I  couldn't touch him!\"    Here Frank's tone became half serious and his changed manner hushed the  laughter of the others. \"I have always ridiculed the idea of hypnotism  and in every experiment where I have been present I have set myself to  disprove its effects. But candidly, folks, I was hypnotized.  Unconsciously I followed that parade a whole dozen blocks myself, and  when I finally came out of the trance, or whatever it was, and started  back to the hotel, the entire atmosphere seemed filled with some kind of  uncanny dope. I never witnessed such contagious energy and earnestness,  and every step emanated spiritual sparks that blinded my eyes and took  possession of my faculties. Who is she, Jack?\"    \"That is what I want to know. I call her my 'Mystery.' One day while I  was in London and near Trafalgar Square I saw a demonstration of women  down toward the parliament buildings. I went that way to see what was up  and soon discovered that it was a body of English suffragettes making an  attempt to exercise their claimed right to petition parliament. As  usual, the demonstration was more or less strenuous and the police  interfered. When I got close enough to identify them, I saw my 'Mystery'  in the front ranks, exhorting the women, protesting and pleading with  the policemen, and gradually getting nearer and nearer the parliament  buildings until they had almost reached one of the entrances. It looked  very much as if they might get entirely in and vindicate their claim,  but just at that moment a fresh squad of police arrived under an officer  superior to any present, and ordered the arrest of the leaders. My  'Mystery' was the first arrested. It was then that I discovered that she  was an American girl. The speech she delivered to those police officers  on human rights and human liberties and women's rights and women's  liberties is worthy a place among the world's great orations. They took  her and the rest of them away, but I noticed that they treated her with  marked respect. I don't think any of them were jailed on that occasion,  but she defied them to jail her. The next time I saw her was at the  Grand Opera House in Paris, two months later. She was with some friends  in an adjoining stall. It was a gala performance for the benefit of the  flood sufferers and the most noted singers in the world had volunteered  their services, and single acts from a number of operas were given. It  was difficult to believe that this beautiful, stylish, richly-gowned  girl was the one I saw arrested in a suffrage disturbance on the streets  of London. Throughout the performance I watched her closely, and her  expressive face reflected the emotion of every leading role. She partook  of the abandon of the gayer airs in 'Carmen,' and her cheeks were  flooded with tears at the misfortunes of Marguerite in 'Faust.' I was  dying to know who she was, but I was with foreign surgeons, and saw no  Americans that I knew. To-day is the first time I have seen her since.  Who is she, Hilda?\" eagerly he asked of his sister.    \"You and Frank give me a lot of exclamation points, with a vivid  description of how the atmosphere affected you, and then want me to name  a vision for you. Please describe the physical girl, leaving out all  adjectives, mystical pieces of air, _et cetera_, and perhaps I can tell  who she is.\"    Jack described the girl in the parade, somewhat repressing his  enthusiasm under Frank's amused scrutiny.    \"I don't wonder at your captivation. That is Silvia Holland, one rich  American girl who is determined to justify her existence, live a life  that is worth while, and demonstrate the ability of women to be  economically independent, for although her father has a half-dozen city,  country and resort residences, she insists in maintaining at her own  expense a modest apartment in the Whittier Studios, and keeps up her own  country home on the Hudson at Nutwood. Just now her parents are on a  trip around the world. You know she is a graduate of the law school at  Columbia and was admitted to practice a few months ago. You should thank  your stars, Jack, that it is not the medical profession she is seeking  to enter, or the dry bones there would be worse shaken up than they will  be by your new theories, and you would have a formidable rival.\"    \"She is not the daughter of John J. Holland, the steel magnate?\" he  inquired.    \"Yes, his daughter and only child.\"    \"Whew! There is hope of the American woman after all. There certainly is  a big social revolution on in America,\" and Jack arose with the others  to go into the library for coffee.    \"It might interest you young men to know that these suffragists are to  finish their day's work with a ball and a bazaar to-night, and I have  tickets for a box,\" suggested Hilda.    \"Of course Jack can't go, but I shall be delighted to bask in the smiles  of this modern Semiramis a while,\" answered Frank. \"Then, too,\" he  added, \"she may convert me to suffrage, which living in Colorado among  suffragists for two years has failed to do.\"    \"Oh, that is because you are looking at the matter through a railroad  attorney's eyes; long ago it was truly written that 'no man can serve  two masters,' and your railroad employment is your master just now,\"  answered his sister.    \"I have heard reports that indicate that woman's suffrage in Colorado is  apt quite soon to cause not only you railroad lawyers but our holders of  railroad securities some concern about the quantity of water we inject  into any one issue of stocks and bonds,\" laughingly suggested Mr.  Ramsey.    \"Come, gentlemen, your charming Amazon will not stay up all night, and  it is ten-thirty now,\" called Hilda, who had already garbed herself for  the automobile.          CHAPTER IV    A SUFFRAGE BAZAAR AND BALL      A suffrage bazaar does not differ essentially from the same iniquity  under other auspices. There are the same useless articles for sale and  the same aggressive methods of disposing of them; the same varieties of  fancy work, knit, embroidered, drawn, quartered and crocheted; the same  display of canned goods and home-made jellies and feminine apparel; the  same raffles and \"drawings\" and \"chances\" by which churches have long  conducted their clerical lotteries; the same side-shows and the same  appeal to the social world to come and mingle with the \"high-brows\" and  be fashionably robbed.    Only in this instance far more ingenuity had been displayed in the  number and nature of the side attractions. There were guessing machines  where the cocksure were reduced to humbleness of mind by their failures  to state accurately the number of women voting in the world or some  section thereof; the number of countries that have recently swung into  line in the woman movement; the number of subjects reigned over by  women, and similar questions, all of which proved \"extra hazardous\" to  most of the guessers. Many of them did not even know what the five stars  on the suffrage flag indicated.    They had a row of Chinese examination booths, in which persons wishing a  certificate of \"Efficient Citizenship\" were given blanks to fill out, in  which they revealed their knowledge, or their crass ignorance, of  conditions in various parts of their own country. Mrs. Jarley conducted  a wax-works performance, and there was a moving-picture show in which  Mrs. Cornelia Gracchus, the favorite example of the \"Antis,\" was shown  lecturing in the Forum on medicine to grave and reverend seigneurs, Joan  of Arc leading her troops, and Florence Nightingale bending over the  sick and wounded.    An educated pig told the uneducated person in how many States women have  full suffrage, and which they are; where suffrage campaigns are pending,  and the names of the distinguished Americans who have gone on record in  favor of this reform. A Street of All Nations showed the onward march,  all the way from the women of Washington casting their \"recall\" ballots  to the women of China unbinding their feet, and Turkish ladies tearing  their veils into tatters.    Dancing was going on in an adjoining room, but the crowd was so great "]]]
