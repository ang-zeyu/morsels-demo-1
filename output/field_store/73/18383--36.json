That this plays any great part in determining the procreation in the  first place is not probable; but that it later becomes a matter of  consideration is not to be doubted. However, in so far as these  considerations of personal welfare enter into the compensation of the  parents for the sacrifices that they have made for their offspring, in  just so far do we remove these considerations from the realm of the  phyletic and place them within the realm of the egoistic.    Reverting again to a discussion of the lower organisms--we have yet to  consider the character and extent of the compensation which these  organisms, which are unconscious of sacrifice, receive. The conscious  sacrifice of higher animals receives a conscious compensation;  similarly the unconscious sacrifice of lower organisms receives an  unconscious compensation.    It will be remembered that the amoeba did not die, but that it was  _rejuvenated in its offspring_. In the next and every succeeding  generation there is no death, but a rejuvenation. It thus transpires  that these lowly organisms enjoy immortality; or perhaps it may be  better stated, that the protoplasm of these organisms enjoys  immortality and this immortality is the compensation for the sacrifice  which each successive individual makes unconsciously in the division  of its protoplasm. This principle of biology was first discovered and  formulated by the great German Biologist, Weissmann.      Summary of Principles.    a. The propagation of offspring and the protection and support of the  young and defenseless always involve sacrifice on the part of the  parents and the stronger members of the race.    b. Sacrifice made consciously for the race is, in the natural order of  things, compensated.          CHAPTER II    ADOLESCENCE IN THE MALE          ADOLESCENCE IN THE MALE.      The period of a young man's life from about fifteen to twenty-five  years, when he is growing from boyhood to mature adult life, is called  the period of _adolescence_. The period of adolescence is ushered in  by a series of physical and psychical changes which make a well  defined initial period called _puberty_. The period of puberty is  about two years in length, and in the average case among American  boys, covers the period between the fifteenth and seventeenth years,  and is completed when the youth can produce fertile semen capable of  fertilizing the human ovum. It is now universally recognized, however,  that when the youth reaches this point in his development, while he  may be called a man, he represents manhood in its lowest terms. He has  not reached either a physical or mental development or maturity which  justifies him in undertaking the responsibilities incident to  procreating his kind. It requires in the average case a period of  eight more years to develop the young man to the full stature of adult  manhood, possessing his full physical and mental powers and the  strength required of one who should assume the responsibilities of  parenthood, so that at the age of twenty-five in the average case the  young man may be said to have reached this period of complete  development and to have finished the adolescent period. We may  profitably now consider more in detail some of the changes incident to  this most important period.      1. PHYSICAL CHANGES.    General Changes in the Body.    a. =Pilosity.=--The human being belongs to the vertebrate class,  mammalia, and as a member of that class he possesses over the  cutaneous surface of the body, excepting the palms of the hands and  soles of the feet, hair follicles which produce the hairy covering  typical of mammals. A careful study of the distribution of the hair on  the surface of the human body, comparing it with that of the  anthropoid apes, demonstrates that the distribution is identical; and  the \"lay\" of the hair in any one region of the human body corresponds  exactly with that of the same region in the ape. For example--the hair  on the forearm points outward and upward; on the upper arm down-ward  and outward and so on throughout in the human and simian types. Every  child comes into the world with a coat of rudimentary hair which is  shed at once. Aside from the growth of hair on the head, including the  brows and the lashes, the skin is quite free from any noticeable  growth of hair for months or even years. Beginning at the age of  puberty, however, the growth of hair is very much accelerated over the  whole pilous surface of the body, particularly upon the face, in the  axilla and over the pubic region. It is a generally recognized law of  biology, that, at the period of sexual development, the hairy  mammalian character becomes accentuated. The increase in the growth of  hair at this time can have only one interpretation, viz., that the  ancestors of man represented a very much higher degree of pilosity  than is the case with man at the present time. It is interesting to  note in this connection the almost universal attempt of men to rid the  face of this hairy growth by various devices, either pulling the beard  or shaving it. The origin of this custom of depilation probably dates  back to the remote past and has been observed as a custom among both  savages and civilized peoples.    b. =The Voice.=--In all animals the voice plays an important part in  sexual and social relations. In many animals the voice seems to have  almost no other function than as a sex call, or a communication  between mates and between parents and young. The human subject  illustrates this general biological principle in the profound changes  which the voice undergoes at the time of puberty. These changes in the  male subject consist in increasing the depth of the larynx, thereby  increasing the length of the vocal cords which in turn modifies the  pitch of the voice, usually about an octave, making it not only lower  but much more pleasing in quality and greatly increased in volume.    c. =Bone, Muscle and Gland.=--Of incalculably greater importance than  the changes described above though perhaps less noticeable to the  casual observer, are those physical changes which the body undergoes  during the first half of the period of adolescence. I refer to the  growth of bone, of muscles and of those internal organs associated  with nutrition.    The first step in these profound physical changes is a rapid growth in  height that makes itself manifest about the fifteenth year. It is not  at all unusual for a boy to grow from four to six inches in a year.  This increase in height is very largely due to a lengthening of the  thigh and leg bones. In serial homology with the thigh and leg are the  bones of the arm and we find that these are undergoing an increase in  length commensurate with the increase of the legs. So the boy outgrows  his clothes; his coat sleeves are drawn up half way to his elbows and  his trousers half way to his knees. The muscles scarcely keep pace  with the bones in their growth, and tend to be flabby and to lack  usual tonicity. It is difficult for the youth to hold his back  straight and his shoulders back; he is awkward and ungainly in his  movements and becomes easily fatigued because of the condition of his  muscles. But the muscles follow immediately in their development and  rapidly gain volume and tonicity, filling out the arms, legs, back and  shoulders with large masses of firm muscular tissue. The growth of  these muscle masses changes the dimensions of the youth and he fills  out in his girths as rapidly as, in the previous period, he increased  in length measurements.    All of this increase in bulk can only be accomplished by increased  activity of all the nutritive processes. The appetite is practically  insatiable; the boy can eat three square meals in the day and lunches  between meals. If he wakes up in the night he is hungry. To accomplish  the digestion and absorption of this food material, the alimentary  tract throughout, and particularly the stomach is greatly increased in  size. To accomplish the distribution of the food (blood) the heart  also is increased in size and strength. With increased bulk of muscle  and increased quantity of food we have increased oxidation in the  tissues. This requires increased respiration, which demand is  satisfied by rapid development of the respiratory system. The thorax  increases in dimensions in all directions; it becomes deeper, broader  and longer. Not only does the thorax become more capacious but also  more mobile and more responsive to the varying requirements of the  system.    If we are interested in the biology of all these changes, we need not  go far to discover the natural causes at work to produce them. Nature  is preparing in the youth a home builder; it is preparing an  individual who can support and protect not only himself, but also a  family. This equipment in the case of primitive man must necessarily  be one of bone and brawn. While under the conditions of modern society  the necessity for bone and brawn is somewhat less marked, the plan of  nature is no less evident and no less interesting.      The Genital System.    a. =Structural Changes.=--The external genitals, besides showing the  pudendal pilosity referred to above, are all greatly increased in  size. The penis is increased in all of its dimensions, the testes  become very much increased in size, the scrotum, probably because of  the increased weight of the testes, is also lengthened.    b. =Functional Changes.=--The testes and associated glandular bodies  gradually develop the power of forming perfect semen, capable of  fertilizing the human ovum. When these organs thus become capable of  procreation, the period of puberty is complete.    In this connection it is important to note that the development of the  testes produces a profound effect upon both the physical and mental  characteristics of the young man. This effect is produced through a  substance formed in the testes and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24714"],[0,"Fairy Tales from Brazil: How and Why Tales from Brazilian Folk-Lore (#4)"],[1,"to her that  some day she shall see me riding on your back with a bridle in your  mouth as if you were my horse.\"    The lamb was very angry. \"Perhaps you are strong enough to pull me  into the sea, and perhaps you can beat me when we run a race,\" said  the lamb, \"but never, never in the world will I be your horse.\"    Time passed and the sunshine was very bright and the soft, gentle  breezes were very sweet. The lamb was so happy again that he forgot  all about how the toad had pulled him into the sea, and how the toad  had beaten him at running the race. He was very sorry for the toad  when he saw him all humped up in a disconsolate little heap one day.  \"O, poor toad, are you sick?\" he asked. \"Isn't there something I can  do to help you?\"    The toad told him how very sick he was. \"There is something you could  do to help me,\" he said, \"but I don't believe that you are quite  strong enough or can travel quite fast enough.\"    The lamb took a deep breath and blew out his chest. \"I'll show you,\"  he said. \"Just tell me what it is.\"    The toad replied that he had promised to be at a party that afternoon  at the house of the king's daughter and he did not see how he could  possibly get there unless some one would carry him.    \"Jump on my back,\" said the lamb. \"I'll carry you.\"    The toad shook about on the lamb's back after they had started so that  it seemed as if he would surely fall off. After a little he said, \"I  can not possibly stand riding like this. It jars all my sore spots.  I'll have to get off.\" He tried it a little while longer and shook  about worse than ever. Then he said, \"Do you know, I think I could  endure this painful ride a little better if only I had something to  hold myself by? Do you mind if I take a piece of grass and put it in  your mouth? I can hold on to that when I shake about and my sore spots  will not hurt so much.\"    The lamb let the toad put a piece of grass in his mouth.    After a while the toad asked for a little stick. \"The flies and  mosquitoes annoy me terribly,\" he said. \"If only I had a little stick  I could wave it about over my head and frighten them away. It is very  bad for any one in my weak, nervous condition to be bothered by flies  and mosquitoes.\" The lamb let the toad have a little stick to wave  over his head.    At last the lamb and the toad drew near to the palace of the king. The  king's daughter was leaning out of the window watching for them. The  toad dug his feet into the lamb's sides, pulled hard on the piece of  the grass in the lamb's mouth and waved the little stick about over  the lamb's head. \"Go on, horse,\" he said and the king's daughter heard  him. She laughed and laughed, and when all the rest of the people in  the palace saw the toad arriving mounted on the lamb's back and  driving him like a horse they laughed too. The lamb went meekly home  to his pasture and from that day to this when one wishes to speak of  meekness one says \"as meek as a lamb.\"          VI    Why the Tiger and the Stag    Fear Each Other      Once upon a time there was a large handsome stag with great branching  horns. One day he said to himself, \"I am tired of having no home of my  own, and of just living anywhere. I shall build me a house.\" He  searched on every hill, in every valley, by every stream, and under  all the trees for a suitable place. At last he found one that was just  right. It was not too high, nor too low, not too near a stream and not  too far away from one, not under too thick trees and not away from the  trees out under the hot sun. \"I am going to build my house here,\" he  said, and he began to clear a place for it at once. He worked all day  and did not go away until night.    Now in that same country there lived a large handsome tiger, with  sharp, sharp teeth and bright, cruel eyes. One day the tiger said to  himself, \"I am tired of having no home of my own,--of just living  around anywhere! I shall build me a house.\" Accordingly the tiger  searched for a place to build his house. He searched on every hill, in  every valley, by every stream, and under all the trees. At last he  found a place which was just right. It was not too high nor too low,  not too near a stream and not too far away from one, not under too  thick trees and yet not away from the trees out in the hot sun. The  tiger said to himself, \"I am going to build my house here. The place  is all ready for me for there isn't very much underbrush here.\" He  began at once and finished clearing the place. Then it became daylight  and he went away.    At daylight the stag came back to do more work on his new house.  \"H'm,\" he said when he looked at the clearing. \"Somebody is helping  me. The place is cleared and ready for me to build the foundation.\"    He began to work at once and worked all day. At night when the  foundation was laid, he went away.    At night the tiger came to work at his new house. \"H'm,\" he said when  he looked at it. \"Somebody is helping me. The foundations of my house  are all laid.\" He began to work at once and built the sides of the  house. He worked all night and went away at daybreak, leaving the  house with the sides completed. There was a big door and a funny  little window in the side.    At daybreak the stag came back to work on his house. When he saw it he  rubbed his eyes for he thought that he must be dreaming. The sides of  the house were completed with a big door and a funny little window.  \"Somebody must surely be helping me,\" he said to himself as he began  to work to put on the roof. He worked hard all day and when the sun  went down, there was a roof of dried grass on the house. \"I can sleep  in my own house to-night,\" he said. He made his bed in the corner and  soon was sound asleep.    At night the tiger came back to work on his new house. When he saw it  he rubbed his eyes for he thought that he must be dreaming. There was  a roof of dried grass on the house.    \"Somebody must surely be helping me,\" he said to himself as he entered  the door. The first thing he saw when he entered the door was the stag  sound asleep in his bed in the corner. \"Who are you and what are you  doing in my house?\" he said in his deepest voice.    The stag woke up with a start. \"Who are you and what are you doing in  my house?\" said the stag in his deepest voice.    \"It is not your house. It is mine. I built it myself,\" said the  tiger.    \"It is my house,\" said the stag. \"I built it myself.\"    \"I made the clearing for the house,\" said the tiger, \"I built the  sides and made the door and window.\"    \"I started the clearing,\" said the stag. \"I laid the foundations and  put on the roof of dried grass.\"    The stag and the tiger quarrelled all night about whose house it was.  At daybreak they decided that they would live together there.    The next night the tiger said to the stag, \"I'm going hunting. Get the  water and have the wood ready for the fire. I shall be almost famished  when I return.\"    The stag got the wood and water ready. After a while the tiger came  back. He brought home for dinner a great handsome stag. The stag had  no appetite at all and he didn't sleep a wink that night.    The next day the stag said that he was going hunting. He told the  tiger to have the wood and water ready when he got back. The tiger got  the wood and water ready. By and by the stag came back bringing with  him the body of a great tiger.    \"I am nearly famished,\" said the stag. \"Let's have dinner right away.\"  The tiger hadn't any appetite at all and he could not eat a mouthful.    That night neither the tiger nor the stag could sleep a wink. The  tiger was afraid the stag would kill him if he shut his eyes for a  minute, and the stag was afraid the tiger would kill him if he slept  or even pretended to be asleep. Accordingly he kept wide awake too.    Toward morning the stag got very cramped from keeping in one position  so long. He moved his head slightly. In doing this his horns struck  against the roof of the house. It made a terrible noise. The tiger  thought that the stag was about to spring upon him and kill him. He  made a leap for the door and ran out of it as fast as he could. He ran  and ran until he was far, far away from the house with the roof of  dried grass.    The stag thought that the tiger was about to spring upon him and kill  him. He, too, made a leap for the door and ran and ran until he was  far, far away from the house with the roof of dried grass. The tiger  and the stag are still running away from each other until this very  day.    The house with the roof of dried grass waited and waited there in the  place which was neither too high nor too low, too near the river nor  too far away, not under too thick trees nor out in the hot sun. It  waited and waited until it go so tired it fell down in a heap.          VII    How the Speckled Hen Got    Her Speckles      Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, there was a little white hen. One  day she was busily engaged in scratching the soil to find worms and  insects for her breakfast. As she worked she sang over and over again  her little crooning song, \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, quirrichi.\" Suddenly  she noticed a tiny piece of paper lying on the ground. \"Quirrichi,  quirrichi, what luck!\" she said to herself. \"This must be a letter.  One time when the king, the great ruler of our country, held his court  in the meadow close by, many people brought him letters and laid them  at his feet. Now I, too, even I, the little white hen, have a letter.  I am going to carry my letter to the king.\"    The next morning the little white hen started bravely out on her long  journey. She carried the letter very carefully in her little brown  basket. It was a long distance to the royal palace where the king  lived. The little white hen had never been so far from home in all her  life.    After a while she met a friendly fox. Foxes and little white hens are  not usually very good friends, you know, but this fox was a"]]]
