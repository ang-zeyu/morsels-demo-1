Nor was it without reason that they were called  Captives by the Egyptians, since one of our ancestors, Joseph, told the  king of Egypt that he was a captive, and afterward sent for his brethren  into Egypt by the king's permission. But as for these matters, I shall  make a more exact inquiry about them elsewhere. [11]    15. But now I shall produce the Egyptians as witnesses to the antiquity  of our nation. I shall therefore here bring in Manetho again, and what  he writes as to the order of the times in this case; and thus he speaks:  \"When this people or shepherds were gone out of Egypt to Jerusalem,  Tethtoosis the king of Egypt, who drove them out, reigned afterward  twenty-five years and four months, and then died; after him his son  Chebron took the kingdom for thirteen years; after whom came Amenophis,  for twenty years and seven months; then came his sister Amesses, for  twenty-one years and nine months; after her came Mephres, for twelve  years and nine months; after him was Mephramuthosis, for twenty-five  years and ten months; after him was Thmosis, for nine years and eight  months; after him came Amenophis, for thirty years and ten months;  after him came Orus, for thirty-six years and five months; then came his  daughter Acenchres, for twelve years and one month; then was her brother  Rathotis, for nine years; then was Acencheres, for twelve years and five  months; then came another Acencheres, for twelve years and three months;  after him Armais, for four years and one month; after him was Ramesses,  for one year and four months; after him came Armesses Miammoun, for  sixty-six years and two months; after him Amenophis, for nineteen years  and six months; after him came Sethosis, and Ramesses, who had an army  of horse, and a naval force. This king appointed his brother, Armais,  to be his deputy over Egypt.\" [In another copy it stood thus: \"After  him came Sethosis, and Ramesses, two brethren, the former of whom had a  naval force, and in a hostile manner destroyed those that met him  upon the sea; but as he slew Ramesses in no long time afterward, so he  appointed another of his brethren to be his deputy over Egypt.] He  also gave him all the other authority of a king, but with these only  injunctions, that he should not wear the diadem, nor be injurious to the  queen, the mother of his children, and that he should not meddle with  the other concubines of the king; while he made an expedition against  Cyprus, and Phoenicia, and besides against the Assyrians and the Medes.  He then subdued them all, some by his arms, some without fighting, and  some by the terror of his great army; and being puffed up by the great  successes he had had, he went on still the more boldly, and overthrew  the cities and countries that lay in the eastern parts. But after some  considerable time, Armais, who was left in Egypt, did all those very  things, by way of opposition, which his brother had forbid him to do,  without fear; for he used violence to the queen, and continued to make  use of the rest of the concubines, without sparing any of them; nay, at  the persuasion of his friends he put on the diadem, and set up to oppose  his brother. But then he who was set over the priests of Egypt wrote  letters to Sethosis, and informed him of all that had happened, and  how his brother had set up to oppose him: he therefore returned back to  Pelusium immediately, and recovered his kingdom again. The country also  was called from his name Egypt; for Manetho says, that Sethosis was  himself called Egyptus, as was his brother Armais called Danaus.\"    16. This is Manetho's account. And evident it is from the number of  years by him set down belonging to this interval, if they be summed up  together, that these shepherds, as they are here called, who were  no other than our forefathers, were delivered out of Egypt, and came  thence, and inhabited this country, three hundred and ninety-three years  before Danaus came to Argos; although the Argives look upon him [12] as  their most ancient king Manetho, therefore, hears this testimony to two  points of the greatest consequence to our purpose, and those from the  Egyptian records themselves. In the first place, that we came out of  another country into Egypt; and that withal our deliverance out of it  was so ancient in time as to have preceded the siege of Troy almost a  thousand years; but then, as to those things which Manetbo adds, not  from the Egyptian records, but, as he confesses himself, from some  stories of an uncertain original, I will disprove them hereafter  particularly, and shall demonstrate that they are no better than  incredible fables.    17. I will now, therefore, pass from these records, and come to those  that belong to the Phoenicians, and concern our nation, and shall  produce attestations to what I have said out of them. There are then  records among the Tyrians that take in the history of many years,  and these are public writings, and are kept with great exactness, and  include accounts of the facts done among them, and such as concern their  transactions with other nations also, those I mean which were worth  remembering. Therein it was recorded that the temple was built by king  Solomon at Jerusalem, one hundred forty-three years and eight months  before the Tyrians built Carthage; and in their annals the building of  our temple is related; for Hirom, the king of Tyre, was the friend of  Solomon our king, and had such friendship transmitted down to him  from his forefathers. He thereupon was ambitious to contribute to the  splendor of this edifice of Solomon, and made him a present of one  hundred and twenty talents of gold. He also cut down the most excellent  timber out of that mountain which is called Libanus, and sent it to  him for adorning its roof. Solomon also not only made him many other  presents, by way of requital, but gave him a country in Galilee  also, that was called Chabulon. [13] But there was another passion, a  philosophic inclination of theirs, which cemented the friendship that  was betwixt them; for they sent mutual problems to one another, with  a desire to have them unriddled by each other; wherein Solomon was  superior to Hirom, as he was wiser than he in other respects: and many  of the epistles that passed between them are still preserved among the  Tyrians. Now, that this may not depend on my bare word, I will produce  for a witness Dius, one that is believed to have written the Phoenician  History after an accurate manner. This Dius, therefore, writes thus, in  his Histories of the Phoenicians: \"Upon the death of Abibalus, his son  Hirom took the kingdom. This king raised banks at the eastern parts  of the city, and enlarged it; he also joined the temple of Jupiter  Olympius, which stood before in an island by itself, to the city, by  raising a causeway between them, and adorned that temple with donations  of gold. He moreover went up to Libanus, and had timber cut down for the  building of temples. They say further, that Solomon, when he was king  of Jerusalem, sent problems to Hirom to be solved, and desired he would  send others back for him to solve, and that he who could not solve the  problems proposed to him should pay money to him that solved them. And  when Hirom had agreed to the proposals, but was not able to solve the  problems, he was obliged to pay a great deal of money, as a penalty  for the same. As also they relate, that one OEabdemon, a man of Tyre, did  solve the problems, and propose others which Solomon could not solve,  upon which he was obliged to repay a great deal of money to Hirom.\"  These things are attested to by Dius, and confirm what we have said upon  the same subjects before.    18. And now I shall add Menander the Ephesian, as an additional witness.  This Menander wrote the Acts that were done both by the Greeks and  Barbarians, under every one of the Tyrian kings, and had taken much  pains to learn their history out of their own records. Now when he was  writing about those kings that had reigned at Tyre, he came to Hirom,  and says thus: \"Upon the death of Abibalus, his son Hirom took the  kingdom; he lived fifty-three years, and reigned thirty-four. He raised  a bank on that called the Broad Place, and dedicated that golden pillar  which is in Jupiter's temple; he also went and cut down timber from the  mountain called Libanus, and got timber Of cedar for the roofs of  the temples. He also pulled down the old temples, and built new ones;  besides this, he consecrated the temples of Hercules and of Astarte. He  first built Hercules's temple in the month Peritus, and that of Astarte  when he made his expedition against the Tityans, who would not pay him  their tribute; and when he had subdued them to himself, he returned  home. Under this king there was a younger son of Abdemon, who mastered  the problems which Solomon king of Jerusalem had recommended to be  solved.\" Now the time from this king to the building of Carthage is  thus calculated: \"Upon the death of Hirom, Baleazarus his son took the  kingdom; he lived forty-three years, and reigned seven years: after him  succeeded his son Abdastartus; he lived twenty-ni"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#4)"],[1,",  then mix well through a teacup of cracklings--left from rendering lard.  Wet up with boiling water, make into small pones, and bake brown in a  quick but not scorching oven.    _Pumpkin Bread_: (Pioneer.) Sift a pint of meal, add salt to season  fully, then rub through a large cupful of stewed pumpkin, made very  smooth. Add half a cup melted lard, then mix with sweet milk to a fairly  stiff dough, make pones, and bake crisp. Mashed sweet potato can be used  instead of pumpkin, and cracklings, rubbed very fine in place of lard.  Folks curious as to older cookery, can even make persimmon bread, using  the pulp of ripe persimmons to mix with the meal--but they will need  the patience of Job to free the pulp properly from skin and seed.    _Mush Batter Cakes_: (For Invalids.) Bring half a pint of water to a  bubbling boil in something open, add to it a pinch of salt, then by  littles, strew in a cup of sifted meal, stirring it well to avoid lumps.  Let cool partly, then cook by small spoonfuls on a hot griddle very  lightly greased. Make the spoonfuls brown on both sides, and serve very  hot.    _Wafers_: (For Invalids or Parties.) Rub a cup of lard or butter,  through a quart of sifted flour. Butter will give enough salt--with lard  add a pinch. Mix with sweet milk, the richer the better, to a smooth  dough, not stiff nor soft. Shape into balls the size of a small egg,  roll out very thin, prick lightly all over, and bake brown--it will take  about five minutes in a quick oven. Cool on cloth and keep dry. Handle  delicately--if the wafers are what they should be; they break and  crumble at any rough touch.          [Illustration: _Saving Your Bacon_]      Plenty in the smokehouse was the cornerstone of the old time southern  cookery. Hence hog-killing was a festival as joyous as Christmas--and  little less sacred. There was keen rivalry amongst plantations as to  which should show the finest pen of fattening hogs. Though the  plantation force was commonly amply sufficient for the work of  slaughter, owners indulged their slaves by asking help of each other--of  course returning the favor at need.    A far cry from a cook book, common or garden variety. Here, it is worth  its space, as explaining in a measure what follows. Namely full  direction for choosing your fatted pig, cutting him up, and making the  most of the ultimate results. Choose carcasses between a hundred and  seventy-five and a hundred and fifty pounds in weight, of a fresh pinky  white hue, free of cuts, scratches, or bruises, the skin scraped clean,  and firm, not slimy, to touch, the fat firm and white, the lean a lively  purplish pink. Two inches of clear fat over the backbone, and the thick  of the ribs should be the limit. Anything more is wasteful--unless there  is a great need of lard in the kitchen. The pig should be chilled  throughout, but not frozen--freezing injures flavor and texture  somewhat, besides preventing the proper quick striking in of salt.    Curing space permitting, it is wise to cut up several pigs at once. The  trouble is hardly increased, and the results, especially in saving, very  much greater. The head will have been at least half severed in  slaughtering. With a very sharp butcher knife, after the pig is laid on  the chopping block, cut deeply through the skin, all round, then with a  blow or two of the axe sever the head. Next cut through the skin deeply,  either side of the back bone. The cuts should be evenly parallel, and  about two inches apart. Now turn the pig on his back, part the legs and  with the meat axe chop through the ribs, and joints. After chopping, cut  the backbone free with the knife, trim off the strip of fat for the lard  pile, chop the backbone itself into pieces three to four inches long,  until the chine is reached--the part betwixt the shoulder blades with  the high spinal processes. Leave the chine intact for smoking, along  with the jowls and sausage.    Pull out the leaf-fat--it grows around and over the kidneys. Also pull  out the spare ribs, leaving only one or two in the shoulders. This done,  chop off feet, then with the knife cut hams and shoulders free from the  sides. Trim after cutting out, saving all trimmings for sausage. Save  every bit of pure fat for lard. Also cut away the clear fat at the top  of the sides, devoting it to the same use. Make clean cuts on the  joints--this means a knife often whetted. Trim the hams rather flat,  and shape the hip bone neatly. The commercial fashion of cutting away  all the upper half of hams is fatal to perfect flavor. Trim shoulders  close, unless they are destined to be made into sausage--in that case  put them with the other scraps. Sides can either be cut into strips four  to five inches wide the long way, after the manner of commercial  \"breakfast bacon,\" or left whole throughout their streaky part, cutting  away solid fat along the top for lard. Separate the heads at the jaw,  leaving the tongue attached to the jowl, and taking care not to cut it.  Cut off the snout two inches above the tip, then lay the upper part of  the head, skin down, crack the inner bone with the axe, press the broken  bones apart, and take out the brains. Jowls are to be salted and  smoked--heads are best either simply corned for boiling with cabbage,  peas, beans, etc., or made in conjunction with the feet into headcheese,  whose south country name is souse.    Use regular pickling salt--coarse-grained and lively. Spread it an inch  thick upon clean wood--a broad shelf, box bottom, or something similar.  Rub the meat well over with salt, and then lay it neatly, skin-side  down, upon the salt layer, spread more salt on top, and put on another  layer of meat. Put sides together, likewise hams and shoulders. Pack as  close as possible and fill all crevices with salt. Salt alone will save  your bacon, but a teacup of moist sugar well mixed through a  water-bucket of salt improves the flavor. Use this on sides, jowls and  chines. The joints, hams and shoulders, especially if the shoulders are  close-cut, need a trifle more sugar in the salt, also a trifle of  saltpeter--say an ounce in fine powder to three gallons of salt. Rub the  skin-sides over with plain salt, and lay upon the salt-covered shelf the  same as sides. Then take a handful of the mixture and rub it in hard  around the bone, then cover the whole cut surface half an inch thick,  spread on dry salt for another layer of hams or shoulders, and repeat.  Salt the chines lightly--their surface, cut all over, takes up too much  salt if permitted. There should be holes or cracks in the bottom to let  the dissolved salt drip away; it is best also to have it a foot at least  above the floor.    Cover the meat thus in bulk, but not too close, and leave standing a  fortnight. The cooler and airier the place it stands in the  better--freezing even is not objectionable when the salt begins striking  in. But with freezing weather the meat must lie longer in salt. Overhaul  it after the first fortnight--that is to say break up the bulk, shake  away bloody salt, sweep the bottom clean, and put on fresh salt. But use  very little saltpeter on the joints this time--on pain of making them  too hard as to their lean. Its use is to give firmness and a handsome  clear red color--an overdose of it produces a faintly undesirable  flavor. Some famous ham makers, at this second salting, rub the cut  sides over lightly with very good molasses, and sprinkle on ground black  pepper, before adding new salt. Others rub in a teaspoonful of sugar  mixed with pounded red pepper around the bone. But very excellent hams  can be made without such excess of painstaking.    Let the meat lie two to four weeks after overhauling, according to the  weather. Take up, wipe all over with coarse clean cloth, furnish each  piece with a loop of stout twine at least four inches long, and so run  through the flesh, tearing out is impossible. Run through the hock of  hams, the upper tip of shoulders, the thickest part of sides, the  pointed tip of jowls. Jowls may not need to lie so long as bigger  pieces, especially if part of their fat has gone to lard. Chines can be  hung up in three weeks, and cured with a very light smoking, along with  the bags of sausage.    Hang hams highest, shoulders next, then sides, jowls, etc. Leave to drip  forty-eight hours unless the weather turns suddenly warm, damp and  muggy--in that case start the smoking after a few hours. Smoke from  green hickory, sound and bright, is needed for the finest flavor. Lay  small logs so they will hug together as they burn, kindle fire along the  whole length of them, then smother it with damp, small chips, trash,  bark and so on, but take care to have everything sound. Rotten wood, or  that which is water-logged or mildewed, makes rank, ill-smelling smoke.  Take greater care that the logs never blaze up, also that the meat is  high enough to escape fire-heating. Once it gets hot from the fire all  your trouble will have been for naught--though it will not be tainted it  will have the same taste and smell--the degree marking the extent of the  heating.    Old southern smokehouses had for the most part earthen floors, trenched  to make the smoke fires safe. Some had puncheon floors, with an earthen  hearth in the middle, whereupon was placed a furnace of loose  brick--that could be kicked over at need, smothering an outbreaking  fire. Still others had big cast iron kettles sunk in a sort of well in  the floor--with a handy water bucket for quenching fires. Whatever the  floor, eternal vigilance was the price of safe bacon--you looked at the  smokehouse fires first thing in the morning and last at night. They were  put out at sundown, but had a knack of burning again from some hidden  seed of live coal. Morning smoke could not well be too thick, provided  it smelled right--keen and clean, reminiscent of sylvan fragrance--a  thick, acrid smoke that set you sneezing and coughing, was "]]]
