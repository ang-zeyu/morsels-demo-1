The river valley separated the stream from a belt of forest  growth which extended to a hill range, dark with impervious jungle, and  cleared here and there for the cultivator's village. Behind it, rose  another sub-range, wooded with a lower bush and already blue with air,  whilst in the background towered range upon range, here rising abruptly  into points and peaks, there ramp-shaped or wall-formed, with sheer  descents, and all of light azure hue adorned with glories of silver and  gold.    After reigning for some years, Vikram the Brave found himself at the  age of thirty, a staid and sober middle-aged man, He had several  sons--daughters are naught in India--by his several wives, and he had  some paternal affection for nearly all--except of course, for his eldest  son, a youth who seemed to conduct himself as though he had a claim to  the succession. In fact, the king seemed to have taken up his abode  for life at Ujjayani, when suddenly he bethought himself, \"I must visit  those countries of whose names I am ever hearing.\" The fact is, he had  determined to spy out in disguise the lands of all his foes, and to find  the best means of bringing against them his formidable army.          *     *     *     *     *     *    We now learn how Bhartari Raja becomes Regent of Ujjayani.    Having thus resolved, Vikram the Brave gave the government into the  charge of a younger brother, Bhartari Raja, and in the garb of a  religious mendicant, accompanied by Dharma Dhwaj, his second son, a  youth bordering on the age of puberty, he began to travel from city to  city, and from forest to forest.    The Regent was of a settled melancholic turn of mind, having lost  in early youth a very peculiar wife. One day, whilst out hunting, he  happened to pass a funeral pyre, upon which a Brahman's widow had just  become Sati (a holy woman) with the greatest fortitude. On his return  home he related the adventure to Sita Rani, his spouse, and she at once  made reply that virtuous women die with their husbands, killed by the  fire of grief, not by the flames of the pile. To prove her truth the  prince, after an affectionate farewell, rode forth to the chase, and  presently sent back the suite with his robes torn and stained, to report  his accidental death. Sita perished upon the spot, and the widower  remained inconsolable--for a time.    He led the dullest of lives, and took to himself sundry spouses, all  equally distinguished for birth, beauty, and modesty. Like his brother,  he performed all the proper devoirs of a Raja, rising before the day to  finish his ablutions, to worship the gods, and to do due obeisance to  the Brahmans. He then ascended the throne, to judge his people according  to the Shastra, carefully keeping in subjection lust, anger, avarice,  folly, drunkenness, and pride; preserving himself from being seduced by  the love of gaming and of the chase; restraining his desire for dancing,  singing, and playing on musical instruments, and refraining from sleep  during daytime, from wine, from molesting men of worth, from dice, from  putting human beings to death by artful means, from useless travelling,  and from holding any one guilty without the commission of a crime. His  levees were in a hall decently splendid, and he was distinguished only  by an umbrella of peacock's feathers; he received all complainants,  petitioners, and presenters of offenses with kind looks and soft words.  He united to himself the seven or eight wise councillors, and the  sober and virtuous secretary that formed the high cabinet of his royal  brother, and they met in some secret lonely spot, as a mountain, a  terrace, a bower or a forest, whence women, parrots, and other talkative  birds were carefully excluded.    And at the end of this useful and somewhat laborious day, he retired to  his private apartments, and, after listening to spiritual songs and  to soft music, he fell asleep. Sometimes he would summon his brother's  \"Nine Gems of Science,\" and give ear to their learned discourses. But it  was observed that the viceroy reserved this exercise for nights when  he was troubled with insomnia--the words of wisdom being to him an  infallible remedy for that disorder.    Thus passed onwards his youth, doing nothing that it could desire,  forbidden all pleasures because they were unprincely, and working in the  palace harder than in the pauper's hut. Having, however, fortunately for  himself, few predilections and no imagination, he began to pride himself  upon being a philosopher. Much business from an early age had dulled  his wits, which were never of the most brilliant; and in the steadily  increasing torpidity of his spirit, he traced the germs of that quietude  which forms the highest happiness of man in this storm of matter called  the world. He therefore allowed himself but one friend of his soul. He  retained, I have said, his brother's seven or eight ministers; he was  constant in attendance upon the Brahman priests who officiated at the  palace, and who kept the impious from touching sacred property; and he  was courteous to the commander-in-chief who directed his warriors, to  the officers of justice who inflicted punishment upon offenders, and  to the lords of towns, varying in number from one to a thousand. But  he placed an intimate of his own in the high position of confidential  councillor, the ambassador to regulate war and peace.    Mahi-pala was a person of noble birth, endowed with shining abilities,  popular, dexterous in business, acquainted with foreign parts, famed for  eloquence and intrepidity, and as Menu the Lawgiver advises, remarkably  handsome.    Bhartari Raja, as I have said, became a quietist and a philosopher.  But Kama,[21] the bright god who exerts his sway over the three worlds,  heaven and earth and grewsome Hades,[22] had marked out the prince once  more as the victim of his blossom-tipped shafts and his flowery bow.  How, indeed, could he hope to escape the doom which has fallen equally  upon Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and dreadful Shiva the  Three-eyed Destroyer[23]?    By reason of her exceeding beauty, her face was a full moon shining in  the clearest sky; her hair was the purple cloud of autumn when, gravid  with rain, it hangs low over earth; and her complexion mocked the pale  waxen hue of the large-flowered jasmine. Her eyes were those of the  timid antelope; her lips were as red as those of the pomegranate's bud,  and when they opened, from them distilled a fountain of ambrosia. Her  neck was like a pigeon's; her hand the pink lining of the conch-shell;  her waist a leopard's; her feet the softest lotuses. In a word, a model  of grace and loveliness was Dangalah Rani, Raja Bhartari's last and  youngest wife.    The warrior laid down his arms before her; the politician spoke  out every secret in her presence. The religious prince would have  slaughtered a cow--that sole unforgivable sin--to save one of her  eyelashes: the absolute king would not drink a cup of water without her  permission; the staid philosopher, the sober quietist, to win from her  the shadow of a smile, would have danced before her like a singing-girl.  So desperately enamoured became Bhartari Raja.    It is written, however, that love, alas! breeds not love; and so  it happened to the Regent. The warmth of his affection, instead of  animating his wife, annoyed her; his protestations wearied her; his vows  gave her the headache; and his caresses were a colic that made her blood  run cold. Of course, the prince perceived nothing, being lost in wonder  and admiration of the beauty's coyness and coquetry. And as women must  give away their hearts, whether asked or not, so the lovely Dangalah  Rani lost no time in lavishing all the passion of her idle soul upon  Mahi-pala, the handsome ambassador of peace and war. By this means the  three were happy and were contented; their felicity, however, being  built on a rotten foundation, could not long endure. It soon ended in  the following extraordinary way.    In the city of Ujjayani,[24] within sight of the palace, dwelt a Brahman  and his wife, who, being old and poor, and having nothing else to do,  had applied themselves to the practice of austere devotion.[25] They  fasted and refrained from drink, they stood on their heads and held  their arms for weeks in the air; they prayed till their knees were like  pads; they disciplined themselves with scourges of wire; and they walked  about unclad in the cold season, and in summer they sat within a circle  of flaming wood, till they became the envy and admiration of all the  plebeian gods that inhabit the lower heavens. In fine, as a reward for  their exceeding piety, the venerable pair received at the hands of a  celestial messenger an apple of the tree Kalpavriksha--a fruit which has  the virtue of conferring eternal life upon him that tastes it.    Scarcely had the god disappeared, when the Brahman, opening his  toothless mouth, prepared to eat the fruit of immortality. Then his wife  addressed him in these words, shedding copious tears the while:    \"To die, O man, is a passing pain; to be poor is an interminable  anguish. Surely our present lot is the penalty of some great crime  committed by us in a past state of being.[26] Callest thou this state  life? Better we die at once, and so escape the woes of the world!\"    Hearing these words, the Brahman sat undecided, with open jaws and eyes  fixed upon the apple. Presently he found tongue: \"I have accepted  the fruit, and have brought it here; but having heard thy speech, my  intellect hath wasted away; now I will do whatever thou pointest out.\"    The wife resumed her discourse, which had been interrupted by a more  than usually copious flow of tears. \"Moreover, O "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#4)"],[1,"iliar.  Hence, he projected three books, one to be placed in the hands of young  women, a second for youths, and a third for a general household book of  reading and reference on medicine and hygiene. These three he completed  in \"The Physical Life of Woman,\" \"The Transmission of Life,\" and the  \"Handbook of Popular Medicine.\"    This plan, he believed, met all the objections to popular medical  instruction, at least all well-grounded objections, while at the same  time it did away with any necessity for concealing truths important to  be known, for fear they should come to the knowledge of those for whom  they were not designed, and on whose minds they might have a disturbing  tendency.    There can be no doubt but that both the plan and its execution were  successful. The many letters he received, filled with thanks from  private parties who had gained inestimable knowledge from these works,  made rich compensation for the occasional severe strictures he received  from those wedded to ancient ways, and who often condemned without even  reading his works.    The intelligent reading public, on whom, after all, the writer must  depend for a verdict on his works, were unanimous in his favor. They  bought them in quantities, and the writer of his life in the  _Transactions of the Pennsylvania State Medical Society_, above quoted,  who wrote in 1877, estimates that by that time over _a quarter of a  million_ copies had been printed and sold. Translations were made into  the German, and several editions pirated and printed in Canada and  England. In fact, the works may now be considered to rank as classics in  the language, and many years must go by before another such series can  be written, on topics of this nature, with equal delicacy of touch and  accuracy of knowledge.

The maxim is true; but here  is a greater truth: 'Knowledge is safety,'--safety amid the physical  ills that beset us,--safety amid the moral pitfalls that environ us.    Filled with this thought, we write this book. It is the Revelation of  Science to Woman. It tells her, in language which aims at nothing but  simplicity, the results which the study of her nature, as distinct from  that of man, has attained. We may call it her physical biography.    It is high time that such a book were written. The most absorbing  question of the day is the 'Woman Question.' The social problems of  chiefest interest concern her. And nowhere are those problems more  zealously studied than in America, which has thrown aside the trammels  of tradition, and is training its free muscles with intent to grapple  the untried possibilities of social life. Who can guide us in these  experiments? What master, speaking as one having authority, can advise  us? There is such a guide, such a master. The laws of woman's physical  life shape her destiny and reveal her future. Within these laws all  things are possible; beyond them, nothing is of avail.    Especially should woman herself understand her own nature. How many  women are there, with health, beauty, merriment, ay, morality too, all  gone, lost for ever, through ignorance of themselves!
