The population was mostly of Cossacks  of the Don and Little Russians. The industries of the place were closely  akin to farming. Agricultural implements were manufactured; there were  wool-cleaning yards, soap and candle factories, wheat-mills, brandy  distilleries, leather tanneries, cloth manufactories, and brick kilns.    The horse fairs at Kharkoff are patronised by buyers from all parts of  Russia, but to outsiders the city is probably better known as the early  cradle of Nihilistic notions. Although quite a handsome city, with fine  streets and remarkably good shops, Kharkoff has nothing special to  attract the casual visitor, and in ordinary times a few hours are more  than sufficient to get a fair idea of the place.    With a railway ticket punched so often that there is very little left of  it, we proceed to Rostoff, where we shall strike the main line from  Moscow to the Caucasus. Here is a comparatively new city--not unlike the  shambling lesser Western cities of the United States of America, with  plenty of tumbling-down, made-anyhow fences, and empty tin cans lying  everywhere. The streets are unpaved, and the consequent dust blinding,  the drinking saloons in undue proportion to the number of houses, and  votka-drunken people in undue proportion to the population.  Votka-drunkenness differs from the intoxication of other liquors in one  particular. Instead of \"dead drunk\" it leaves the individuals drunk-dead.  You see a disgusting number of these corpse-like folks lying about the  streets, cadaverous-looking and motionless, spread flat on their faces or  backs, uncared-for by everybody. Some sleep it off, and, if not run over  by a droshki, eventually go home; some sleep it on, and are eventually  conveyed to the graveyard, and nobody seems any the wiser except, of  course, the people who do not drink bad votka to excess.    Rostoff stands at the head of the Delta of the Don, a position of great  strategical importance, where of course the Russians have not failed to  build strong fortifications. These were begun as early as 1761. Now very  active ship-building yards are found here, and extensive caviare  factories. Leather, wool, corn, soap, ropes and tobacco are also  exported, and the place, apart from its military importance, is steadily  growing commercially. The majority of shops seem to deal chiefly in  American and German made agricultural implements, machinery and tools,  and in firearms and knives of all sizes and shapes. The place is not  particularly clean and certainly hot, dusty and most unattractive. One is  glad to get into the train again and steam away from it.    As we get further South towards the Caucasus the country grows more  barren and hot, the dust is appalling, but the types of inhabitants at  the little stations become very picturesque. The Georgians are very fine  people and the Armenians too, in appearance at least. The station sheds  along the dusty steppes are guarded by soldiers, presumably to prevent  attacks on the trains, and as one gets near the Caspian one begins to see  the wooden pyramids over oil wells, and long freight trains of petroleum  carried in iron cylindrical tanks. The wells get more numerous as we go  along; the stations more crowded with petroleum tanks. We are nearing the  great naphtha wells of Baku, where at last we arrive, having travelled  from Tuesday to Sunday afternoon, or five days, except a few hours' halt  in Kiev, Kharkoff and Rostoff.    [Illustration: The Baku Oil Wells.]    The first-class railway fare from Warsaw for the whole journey was fully  covered by a five-pound note, and, mind you, could have been done cheaper  if one chose to travel by slower trains on a less direct route!

So many accounts are heard of how one's registered baggage in Russia  generally arrives with locks smashed and minus one's most valuable  property, and how unpunctual in arriving luggage is, and how few  passengers escape without having their pockets picked before reaching  their destination--by the way, a fellow-passenger had his pockets picked  at the station of Mineralnya Vod--that I was somewhat anxious to see my  belongings again, and fully expected to find that something had gone  wrong with them. Much to my surprise, on producing the receipt at the  very handsome railway terminus, all my portmanteaux and cases were  instantly delivered in excellent condition.    The Caspian Sea steamers for Persia leave Baku on Sunday and Tuesday at  midnight. There was a fierce sand storm raging at the time and the  steamer had returned without being able to land her passengers at their  destination. I decided to wait till the Tuesday. There is plenty to  interest one in Baku. I will not describe the eternal fires, described so  often by other visitors, nor tell how naphtha was tapped for the first  time at this place, and how in 1886 one particular well spouted oil with  such tremendous force that it was impossible to check it and it deluged a  good portion of the neighbourhood. A year later, in 1887, another  fountain rose to a height of 350 ft. There are myriads of other lesser  fountains and wells, each covered by a wooden shed like a slender  pyramid, and it is a common occurrence to see a big spout of naphtha  rising outside and high above the top of the wooden shed, now from one  well, now from another.    The process of bringing naphtha to the surface under ordinary  circumstances is simple and effective, a metal cylinder is employed that  has a valve at the lower end allowing the tube to fill while it descends,  and closing automatically when the tube is full and is being raised above  ground and emptied into pits provided for the purpose. The naphtha then  undergoes the process of refinement. There are at the present moment  hundreds of refineries in Baku. The residue and waste of naphtha are used  as fuel, being very much cheaper than coal or wood.    The greater number of wells are found a few miles out of the town on the  Balakhani Peninsula, and the naphtha is carried into the Baku refineries  by numerous pipe lines. The whole country round is, however, impregnated  with oil, and even the sea in one or two bays near Baku is coated with  inflammable stuff and can be ignited by throwing a lighted match upon it.  At night this has a weird effect.    Apart from the oil, Baku--especially the European settlement--has nothing  to fascinate the traveller. In the native city, Persian in type, with  flat roofs one above the other and the hill top crowned by a castle and  the Mosque of Shah Abbas, constant murders occur. The native population  consists mostly of Armenians and Persians. Cotton, saffron, opium, silk  and salt are exported in comparatively small quantities. Machinery, grain  and dried fruit constitute the chief imports.    The crescent-shaped Baku Bay, protected as it is by a small island in  front of it, affords a safe anchorage for shipping. It has good  ship-yards and is the principal station of the Russian fleet in the  Caspian. Since Baku became part of the Russian Empire in 1806 the harbour  has been very strongly fortified.    The most striking architectural sight in Baku is the round Maiden's Tower  by the water edge, from the top of which the lovely daughter of the Khan  of Baku precipitated herself on to the rocks below because she could not  marry the man she loved.    The most depressing sight in Baku is the vegetation, or rather the  strenuous efforts of the lover of plants to procure verdure at all costs  in the gardens. It is seldom one's lot to see trees and plants look more  pitiable, notwithstanding the unbounded care that is taken of them. The  terrific heat of Baku, the hot winds and sand-storms are deadly enemies  to vegetation. Nothing will grow. One does not see a blade of grass nor a  shrub anywhere except those few that are artificially brought up. The  sand is most trying. It is so fine that the wind forces it through  anything, and one's tables, one's chairs, one's bed are yellow-coated  with it. The tablecloth at the hotel, specklessly white when you begin to  dine, gets gradually yellower at sight, and by the time you are half  through your dinner the waiter has to come with a brush to remove the  thick coating of dust on the table.    These are the drawbacks, but there is an air of prosperity about the  place and people that is distinctly pleasing, even although one may not  share in it. There is quite a fair foreign community of business people,  and their activity is very praiseworthy. The people are very  hospitable--too hospitable. When they do not talk of naphtha, they drink  sweet champagne in unlimited quantities. But what else could they do?  Everything is naphtha here, everything smells of naphtha, the steamers,  the railway engines are run with naphtha. The streets are greasy with  naphtha. Occasionally--frequently of late--the monotony of the place is  broken by fires of gigantic proportions on the premises of over-insured  well-owners. The destruction to property on such occasions is immense,  the fires spreading with incalculable rapidity over an enormous area, and  the difficulty of extinguishing them being considerable.    When I was in Baku the Amir of Bokhara was being entertained in the city  as guest of the Government."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#4)"],[1,"a part of the functions of the  Venetian State than the High Mass in the Catholic Church. Such a  function, with Doge and Senators arrayed in gorgeous costumes no less  prescribed than the raiments of ecclesiastics, in the midst of the  fairy-like architecture of the Piazza or canals, was the event most  eagerly looked forward to, and the one that gave most satisfaction to  the Venetian's love of his State, and to his love of splendour, beauty,  and gaiety. He would have had them every day if it were possible, and,  to make up for their rarity, he loved to have representations of them.  So most Venetian pictures of the beginning of the sixteenth century  tended to take the form of magnificent processions, if they did not  actually represent them. They are processions in the Piazza, as in  Gentile Bellini's \"Corpus Christi\" picture, or on the water, as in  Carpaccio's picture where St. Ursula leaves her home; or they represent  what was a gorgeous but common sight in Venice, the reception or  dismissal of ambassadors, as in several pictures of Carpaccio's St.  Ursula series; or they show simply a collection of splendidly costumed  people in the Piazza, as in Gentile's \"Preaching of St. Mark.\" Not only  the pleasure-loving Carpaccio, but the austere Cima, as he grew older,  turned every biblical and saintly legend into an occasion for the  picture of a pageant.    But there was a further reason for the popularity of such pictures. The  decorations which were then being executed by the most reputed masters  in the Hall of Great Council in the Doge's Palace, were, by the nature  of the subject, required to represent pageants. The Venetian State  encouraged painting as did the Church, in order to teach its subjects  its own glory in a way that they could understand without being led on  to critical enquiry. Venice was not the only city, it is true, that used  painting for political purposes; but the frescoes of Lorenzetti at Siena  were admonitions to govern in accordance with the Catechism, while the  pictures in the Great Hall of the Doge's Palace were of a nature to  remind the Venetians of their glory and also of their state policy.  These mural paintings represented such subjects as the Doge bringing  about a reconciliation between the Pope and the Emperor Barbarossa, an  event which marked the first entry of Venice into the field of  Continental politics, and typified as well its unchanging policy, which  was to gain its own ends by keeping a balance of power between the  allies of the Pope and the allies of his opponents. The first edition,  so to speak, of these works had been executed at the end of the  fourteenth century and in the beginning of the fifteenth. Toward the end  of that century it no longer satisfied the new feeling for reality and  beauty, and thus had ceased to serve its purpose, which was to glorify  the State. The Bellini, Alvise Vivarini, and Carpaccio were employed to  make a second rendering of the very same subjects, and this gave the  Venetians ample opportunity for finding out how much they liked pageant  pictures.    It is curious to note here that at the same time Florence also  commissioned its greatest painters to execute works for its Council  Hall, but left them practically free to choose their own subjects.  Michelangelo chose for his theme \"The Florentines while Bathing  Surprised by the Pisans,\" and Leonardo \"The Battle of the Standard.\"  Neither of these was intended in the first place to glorify the  Florentine Republic, but rather to give scope to the painter's genius,  Michelangelo's for the treatment of the nude, Leonardo's for movement  and animation. Each, having given scope to his peculiar talents in his  cartoon, had no further interest, and neither of the undertakings was  ever completed. Nor do we hear that the Florentine councillors enjoyed  the cartoons, which were instantly snatched up by students who turned  the hall containing them into an academy.      =VI. Painting and the Confraternities.=--It does not appear that the Hall  of Great Council in Venice was turned into a students' academy, and,  although the paintings there doubtless gave a decided incentive to  artists, their effect upon the public, for whom they were designed, was  even greater. The councillors were not allowed to be the only people to  enjoy fascinating pictures of gorgeous pageants and ceremonials. The  Mutual Aid Societies--the Schools, as they were called--were not long in  getting the masters who were employed in the Doge's Palace to execute  for their own meeting places pictures equally splendid. The Schools of  San Giorgio, Sant' Ursula, and Santo Stefano, employed Carpaccio, the  Schools of San Giovanni and San Marco, Gentile Bellini, and other  Schools employed minor painters. The works carried out for these Schools  are of peculiar importance, both because they are all that remain to  throw light upon the pictures in the Doge's Palace destroyed in the fire  of 1576, and because they form a transition to the art of a later day.  Just as the State chose subjects that glorified itself and taught its  own history and policy, so the Schools had pictures painted to glorify  their patron saints, and to keep their deeds and example fresh. Many of  these pictures--most in fact--took the form of pageants; but even in  such, intended as they were for almost domestic purposes, the style of  high ceremonial was relaxed, and elements taken directly from life were  introduced. In his \"Corpus Christi,\" Gentile Bellini paints not only the  solemn and dazzling procession in the Piazza, but the elegant young men  who strut about in all their finery, the foreign loungers, and even the  unfailing beggar by the portal of St. Mark's. In his \"Miracle of the  True Cross,\" he introduces gondoliers, taking care to bring out all the  beauty of their lithe, comely figures as they stand to ply the oar, and  does not reject even such an episode as a serving-maid standing in a  doorway watching a negro who is about to plunge into the canal. He  treats this bit of the picture with all the charm and much of that  delicate feeling for simple effects of light and colour that we find in  such Dutch painters as Vermeer van Delft and Peter de Hoogh.    Episodes such as this in the works of the earliest great Venetian master  must have acted on the public like a spark on tinder. They certainly  found a sudden and assured popularity, for they play a more and more  important part in the pictures executed for the Schools, many of the  subjects of which were readily turned into studies of ordinary Venetian  life. This was particularly true of the works of Carpaccio. Much as he  loved pageants, he loved homelier scenes as well. His \"Dream of St.  Ursula\" shows us a young girl asleep in a room filled with the quiet  morning light. Indeed, it may be better described as the picture of a  room with the light playing softly upon its walls, upon the flower-pots  in the window, and upon the writing-table and the cupboards. A young  girl happens to be asleep in the bed, but the picture is far from being  a merely economic illustration to this episode in the life of the saint.  Again, let us take the work in the same series where King Maure  dismisses the ambassadors. Carpaccio has made this a scene of a  chancellery in which the most striking features are neither the king nor  the ambassadors, but the effect of the light that streams through a side  door on the left and a poor clerk labouring at his task. Or, again, take  St. Jerome in his study, in the Scuola di San Giorgio. He is nothing but  a Venetian scholar seated in his comfortable, bright library, in the  midst of his books, with his little shelf of bric-a-brac running along  the wall. There is nothing in his look or surroundings to speak of a  life of self-denial or of arduous devotion to the problems of sin and  redemption. Even the \"Presentation of the Virgin,\" which offered such a  splendid chance for a pageant, Carpaccio, in one instance, turned into  the picture of a simple girl going to her first communion. In other  words, Carpaccio's quality is the quality of a painter of _genre_, of  which he was the earliest Italian master. His _genre_ differs from Dutch  or French not in kind but in degree. Dutch _genre_ is much more  democratic, and, as painting, it is of a far finer quality, but it deals  with its subject, as Carpaccio does, for the sake of its own pictorial  capacities and for the sake of the effects of colour and of light and  shade.      =VII. Easel Pictures and Giorgione.=--At the beginning of the Renaissance  painting was almost wholly confined to the Church. From the Church it  extended to the Council Hall, and thence to the Schools. There it  rapidly developed into an art which had no higher aim than painting the  sumptuous life of the aristocracy. When it had reached this point, there  was no reason whatever why it should not begin to grace the dwellings of  all well-to-do people.    In the sixteenth century painting was not looked upon with the  estranging reverence paid to it now. It was almost as cheap as printing  has become since, and almost as much employed. When the Venetians had  attained the point of culture where they were able to differentiate  their sensations and distinguish pleasure from edification, they found  that painting gave them decided pleasure. Why should they always have to  go to the Doge's Palace or to some School to enjoy this pleasure? That  would have been no less a hardship than for us never to hear music  outside of a concert-room. This is no merely rhetorical comparison, for  in the life of the Venetian of the sixteenth century painting took much  the same place that music takes in ours. He no longer expected it to  tell him stories or to teach him the Catechism. Printed books, which  were beginning to grow common, amply satisfied both these needs. He had  as a rule very little personal religion, and consequently"]]]
