I  want to do it for Phronsie!\"    \"Yes, let Joel, please,\" put in Polly; \"he'll find it, grandma.\" So Joel  departed with great speed; and presently returned, with a bunch of dry  herbs, which dangled comfortingly by his side, as he came in.    \"Now I'll fix it,\" said Mrs. Bascom, getting up and taking off her  shawl; \"there's a few raisins for you, Polly; I don't want 'em, and  they'll make your cake go better,\" and she placed a little parcel on the  table as she spoke. \"Yes, I'll put it to steep; an' after it's put on  real strong, and tied up in an old cloth, Phronsie won't know as she's  got any toes!\" and grandma broke up a generous supply of the herb, and  put it into an old tin cup, which she covered up with a saucer, and  placed on the stove.    \"Oh!\" said Polly; \"I can't thank you! for the raisins and all--you're so  good!\"    \"They're awful hard,\" said Joel, investigating into the bundle with  Davie, which, however, luckily the old lady didn't hear.    \"There, don't try,\" she said cheerily; \"an' I found cousin Mirandy's  weddin' cake receet, for--\"    \"Did you?\" cried Polly; \"oh! I'm so glad!\" feeling as if that were  comfort enough for a good deal.    \"Yes, 'twas in my Bible,\" said Mrs. Bascom; \"I remember now; I put it  there to be ready to give John's folks when they come in; they wanted  it; so you'll go all straight now; and I must get home, for I left some  meat a-boilin'.\" So grandma put on her shawl, and waddled off, leaving a  great deal of comfort behind her.    \"Now, says I,\" said Polly to Phronsie, when the little foot was snugly  tied up in the wet wormwood, \"you've got to have one of mamsie's old  slippers.\"    \"Oh, ho,\" laughed Phronsie; \"won't that be funny, Polly!\"    \"I should think it would,\" laughed Polly, back again, pulling on the  big cloth slipper, which Joel produced from the bedroom, the two boys  joining uproariously, as the old black thing flapped dismally up and  down, and showed strong symptoms of flying off. \"We shall have to tie it  on.\"    \"It looks like a pudding bag,\" said Joel, as Polly tied it securely  through the middle with a bit of twine; \"an old black pudding bag!\" he  finished.    \"Old black pudding bag!\" echoed Phronsie, with a merry little crow; and  then all of a sudden she grew very sober, and looked intently at the  foot thrust out straight before her, as she still sat in the chair.    \"What is it, Phronsie?\" asked Polly, who was bustling around, making  preparations for the cake-making.    \"Can I ever wear my new shoes again?\" asked the child, gravely, looking  dismally at the black bundle before her.    \"Oh, yes; my goodness, yes!\" cried Polly; \"as quick again as ever;  you'll be around again as smart as a cricket in a week--see if you  aren't!\"    \"Will it go on?\" asked Phronsie, still looking incredulously at the  bundle, \"and button up?\"    \"Yes, indeed!\" cried Polly, again; \"button into every one of the little  holes, Phronsie Pepper; just as elegant as ever!\"    \"Oh!\" said Phronsie; and then she gave a sigh of relief, and thought no  more of it, because Polly had said that all would be right.          MAMSIE'S BIRTHDAY      \"Run down and get the cinnamon, will you, Joey?\" said Polly; \"it's in  the 'Provision Room.\"    The \"Provision Room\" was a little shed that was tacked on to the main  house, and reached by a short flight of rickety steps; so called,  because as Polly said, \"'twas a good place to keep provisions in, even  if we haven't any; and besides,\" she always finished, \"it sounds nice!\"    \"Come on, Dave! then we'll get something to eat!\"    So the cinnamon was handed up, and then Joel flew back to Davie.    And now, Polly's cake was done, and ready for the oven. With many  admiring glances from herself, and Phronsie, who with Seraphina, an  extremely old but greatly revered doll, tightly hugged in her arms was  watching everything with the biggest of eyes from the depths of the old  chair, it was placed in the oven, the door shut to with a happy little  bang, then Polly gathered Phronsie up in her arms, and sat down in the  chair to have a good time with her and to watch the process of cooking.    There was a bumping noise that came from the \"Provision Room\" that  sounded ominous, and then a smothered sound of words, followed by a  scuffling over the old floor.    \"Boys!\" called Polly. No answer; everything was just as still as a  mouse. \"Joel and David!\" called Polly again, in her loudest tones.    \"Yes,\" came up the crooked stairs, in Davie's voice.    \"Come up here, right away!\" went back again from Polly. So up the stairs  trudged the two boys, and presented themselves rather sheepishly before  the big chair.    \"What was that noise?\" she asked; \"what have you been doing?\"    \"Twasn't anything but the pail,\" answered Joel, not looking at her.    \"We had something to eat,\" said Davie, by way of explanation; \"you  always let us.\"    \"I know,\" said Polly; \"that's right, you can have as much bread as you  want to; but what you been doing with the pail?\"    \"Nothing,\" said Joel; \"'twouldn't hangup, that's all.\"    \"And you've been bumping it,\" said Polly; \"oh! Joel, how could you! You  might have broken it; then what would mamsie say?\"    \"I didn't,\" said Joel, stoutly, with his hands in his pockets, \"bump it  worse'n Davie, so there!\"    \"Why, Davie,\" said Polly, turning to him sorrowfully, \"I shouldn't have  thought you would!\"    \"Well, I'm tired of hanging it up,\" said little Davie, vehemently; \"and  I said I wasn't a-goin' to; Joel always makes me; I've done it for two  million times, I guess!\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Polly, sinking back into the chair, \"I don't know  what I ever shall do; here's Phronsie hurt; and we want to celebrate  to-morrow; and you two boys are bumping and banging out the bread pail,  and--\"    \"Oh! we won't!\" cried both of the children, perfectly overwhelmed with  remorse; \"we'll hang it right up.\"    \"I'll hang it,\" said Davie, clattering off down the stairs with a will.    \"No, I will!\" shouted Joel, going after him at double pace; and  presently both came up with shining faces, and reported it nicely done.    \"And now,\" said Polly, after they had all sat around the stove another  half-hour, watching and sniffing expectantly, \"the cake's done!--dear  me! it's turning black!\"    And quickly as possible Polly twitched it out with energy, and set it on  the table.    Oh, dear; of all things in the world! The beautiful cake over which so  many hopes had been formed, that was to have given so much happiness  on the morrow to the dear mother, presented a forlorn appearance as it  stood there in anything but holiday attire. It was quite black on the  top, in the center of which was a depressing little dump, as if to say,  \"My feelings wouldn't allow me to rise to the occasion.\"    \"Now,\" said Polly, turning away with a little fling, and looking at  the stove, \"I hope you're satisfied, you old thing; you've spoiled our  mamsie's birthday!\" and without a bit of warning, she sat right down in  the middle of the floor and began to cry as hard as she could.    \"Well, I never!\" said a cheery voice, that made the children skip.    \"It's Mrs. Beebe; oh, it's Mrs. Beebe!\" cried Davie; \"see, Polly.\"    Polly scrambled up to her feet, ashamed to be caught thus, and whisked  away the tears; the others explaining to their new visitor the sad  disappointment that had befallen them; and she was soon oh-ing, and  ah-ing enough to suit even their distressed little souls.    \"You poor creeters, you!\" she exclaimed at last, for about the fiftieth  time. \"Here, Polly, here's some posies for you, and--\"    \"Oh, thank you!\" cried Polly, with a radiant face, \"why, Mrs. Beebe, we  can put them in here, can't we? the very thing!\"    And she set the little knot of flowers in the hollow of the cake, and  there they stood and nodded away to the delighted children, like brave  little comforters, as they were.    \"The very thing!\" echoed Mrs. Beebe, tickled to death to see their  delight; \"it looks beautiful, I declare! and now, I must run right  along, or pa'll be worrying;\" and so the good woman trotted out to her  waiting husband, who was impatient to be off. Mr. Beebe kept a little  shoe shop in town; and always being of the impression if he left it for  ten minutes that crowds of customers would visit it. He was the most  restless of companions on any pleasure excursion.    \"And Phronsie's got hurt,\" said Mrs. Beebe, telling him the news, as he  finished tucking her up, and started the old horse.    \"Ho? you don't say so!\" he cried; \"whoa!\"    \"Dear me!\" said Mrs. Beebe; \"how you scat me, pal what's the matter?\"    \"What?--the little girl that bought the shoes?\" asked her husband.    \"Yes,\" replied his wife, \"she's hurt her foot.\"    \"Sho, now,\" said the old gentleman; \"that's too bad,\" and he began to  feel in all his pockets industriously; \"there, can you get out again,  and take her that?\" and he laid a small piece of peppermint candy, thick  and white, in his wife's lap.    \"Oh, yes,\" cried Mrs. Beebe, good-naturedly, beginning to clamber over  the wheel.    So the candy was handed in to Phronsie, who insisted that Polly should  hold her up to the window to thank Mr. Beebe. So amid nods, and shakings  of hands, the Beebes drove off, and quiet settled down over the little  brown house again.    \"Now, children,\" said Polly, after Phronsie had made them take a bite of  her candy all around, \"let's get the cake put away safe, for mamsie may  come home early.    \"Where'll you put it?\" asked Joel, wishing the world was all peppermint  candy.    \"Oh--in the cupboard,\" said Polly, taking it up; \"there, Joe, you can  climb up, and put it clear back in the corner, oh! wait; I must take  the posies off, and keep them fresh in water;\" so the cake was finally  deposited in a place of safety, followed by the eyes of all the  children.    \"Now,\" said Polly, as they shut the door tight, \"don't you go to looking  at the cupboard, Joey, or mammy'l"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#4)"],[1,"tube into this barrel with the filiform  extremity uppermost, and the square cut end projecting about 0.5 cm.  beyond the tapering end of the barrel.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Throttle pipette--small capacity.]    8. Drop a small pellet of sealing wax into the barrel by the side of the  capillary tube and then warm the tube at the gas flame until the wax  becomes softened and makes an air-tight joint between the capillary tube  and the end of the barrel.    9. Fit a rubber teat to the open end of the barrel, and so complete a  pipette which can be depended upon to always aspirate and deliver  exactly 5 cm. of fluid.    Slight modification of this procedure is necessary in making tubes to  measure larger volumes than say 75 c. mm. Thus to make a throttle  pipette to measure 100 c. mm.:    1. Take a short length of quill tubing and draw out one end into a roomy  capillary stem, and again draw out the extremity into a fine hair point,  thus forming a small Pasteur pipette with a hair-like capillary  extremity.    2. With a standard pipette fill 100 c. mm. into the neck of this  pipette, and make a scratch with a writing diamond at the upper level  (a) of the mercury meniscus (Fig. 19, A).    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Making throttle pipettes--large capacity]    Now force the mercury down into the capillary stem as far as it will go,  so as to leave the upper part of the tube in the region of the diamond  scratch empty (Fig. 19, B).    3. Heat the tube in the region of the diamond scratch in the blowpipe  flame, and removing the tube from the flame draw it out so that the  diamond scratch now occupies a position somewhere near the centre of  this new capillary portion (Fig. 19, C).    4. Heat the tube in this position in the peep flame of the Bunsen  burner, and draw it out into a hair-like extremity. Snap off the glass  tube, leaving about 5 mm. of hair-like extremity attached to the upper  capillary portion (Fig. 19, D). Allow the glass to cool.    5. Lift up the bulb by the long capillary stem and allow the mercury to  return to its original position--an operation which will be facilitated  by snapping off the hair-like extremity from the long piece of capillary  tubing.    6. Mark on the capillary stem with a grease pencil the position of the  end of the column of mercury (Fig. 19, E.)    7. Warm the capillary tubing at this spot in the peep flame of the  Bunsen burner, and draw it out very slightly so that when cut at this  position a pointed extremity will be obtained.    8. With a glass-cutting knife cut the capillary tube through at the  point \"b,\" and allow the mercury to run out.    9. Now apply a thick layer of sealing wax to the neck of the bulb.    10. Take a piece of 5 mm. bore glass tubing and draw it out as if making  an ordinary Pasteur pipette.    11. Break the capillary portion off so as to leave a covering tube  similar to that already used for the smaller graduated pipettes. Into  this covering tube drop the graduated bulb and draw the capillary stem  down through the conical extremity until further progress is stopped by  the layer of sealing wax.    12. Warm the pipette in the gas flame so as to melt the sealing wax and  make an air-tight joint.    13. Fit an india-rubber teat over the open end of the covering tube, and  the automatic pipette is ready for use (Fig. 19, F).    ~Sedimentation Pipettes~ (Fig. 20).--These are prepared from 10 cm.  lengths of narrow glass tubing by sealing one extremity, blowing a  small bulb at the centre, and plugging the open end with cotton-wool;  after sterilisation the open end is provided with a short piece of  rubber tubing and a glass mouthpiece. When it is necessary to observe  sedimentation reactions in very small quantities of fluid, these tubes  will be found much more convenient than the 5 by 0.5 cm. test-tubes  previously mentioned.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Sedimentation pipette.]    Pasteur pipettes fitted with india-rubber teats will also be found  useful for sedimentation tests when dealing with minute quantities of  serum, etc.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Fermentation tubes.]    ~Fermentation Tubes~ (Fig. 21).--These are used for the collection and  analysis of the gases liberated from the media during the growth of some  varieties of bacteria and may be either plain (a) or graduated (b).  A simple form (Fig. 21, c) may be made from 14 cm. lengths of soft  glass tubing of 1.5 cm. diameter. The Bunsen flame is applied to a spot  some 5 cm. from one end of such a piece of tubing and the tube slightly  drawn out to form a constriction, the constricted part is bent in the  bat's-wing flame, to an acute angle, and the open extremity of the long  arm sealed off in the blowpipe flame. The open end of the short arm is  rounded off and then plugged with cotton-wool, and the tube is ready for  sterilisation.      CLEANING OF GLASS APPARATUS.    All glassware used in the bacteriological laboratory must be thoroughly  cleaned before use, and this rule applies as forcibly to new as to old  apparatus, although the methods employed may vary slightly.    ~To Clean New Test-tubes.~--    1. Place the tubes in a bucket or other convenient receptacle, fill with  water and add a handful of \"Sapon\" or other soap powder. See that the  tubes are full and submerged.    2. Fix the bucket over a large Bunsen flame and boil for thirty  minutes--or boil in the autoclave for a similar period.    3. Cleanse the interior of the tubes with the aid of test-tube brushes,  and rinse thoroughly in cold water.    4. Invert the tubes and allow them to drain completely.    5. Dry the tubes and polish the glass inside and out with a soft cloth,  such as selvyt.    ~New flasks, plates, and capsules~ must be cleaned in a similar manner.    ~To Clean New Graduated Pipettes.~--    1. Place the pipettes in a convenient receptacle, filled with water to  which soap powder has been added.    2. Boil the water vigorously for twenty minutes over a Bunsen flame.    3. Rinse the pipettes in running water and drain.    4. Run distilled water through the pipettes and drain.    5. Run rectified spirits through the pipette and drain as completely as  possible.    6. Place the pipettes in the hot-air oven (_vide_ page 31), close the  door, open the ventilating slide, and run the temperature slowly up to  about 80 deg. C. Turn off the gas and allow the oven to cool.    Or 6a. Attach each pipette in turn to the rubber tube of the foot  bellows, or blowpipe air-blast, and blow air through the pipette until  the interior is dry.    Glassware that has already been used is regarded as _infected_, and is  treated in a slightly different manner.    ~Infected Test-tubes.~--    1. Pack the tubes in the wire basket of the autoclave (having previously  removed the cotton-wool plugs, caps, etc.), in the vertical position,  and before replacing the basket see that there is a sufficiency of water  in the bottom of the boiler. Now attach a piece of rubber tubing to the  nearest water tap, and by means of this fill each tube with water.    2. Disinfect completely by exposing the tubes, etc., to a temperature of  120 deg. C. for twenty minutes (_vide_ page 37).    (If an autoclave is not available, the tubes must be placed in a  digester, or even a large pan or pail with a tightly fitting cover, and  boiled vigorously for some thirty to forty-five minutes to ensure  disinfection.)    3. Whilst still hot, empty each tube in turn and roughly clean its  interior with a stiff test-tube brush.    4. Place the tubes in a bucket or other convenient receptacle, fill with  water and add a handful of Sapon or other soap powder. See that the  tubes are full and submerged.    5. Fix the bucket over a large Bunsen flame and boil for thirty minutes.    6. Cleanse the interior of the tubes with the aid of test-tube brushes,  and rinse thoroughly in cold water.    7. Drain off the water and immerse tubes in a large jar containing water  acidulated with 2 to 5 per cent. hydrochloric acid. Allow them to remain  there for about fifteen minutes.    8. Remove from the acid jar, drain, rinse thoroughly in running water,  then with distilled water.    9. Invert the tubes and allow them to drain completely.    Dry the tubes and polish the glass inside and out with a soft cloth,  such as selvyt.    ~Infected flasks, plates, and capsules~ must be treated in a similar  manner.    ~Flasks~ which have been used only in the preparation of media must be  cleaned immediately they are finished with. Fill each flask with water  to which some soap powder and a few crystals of potassium permanganate  have been added, and let boil over the naked flame. The interior of the  flask can then usually be perfectly cleaned with the aid of a flask  brush, but in some cases water acidulated with 5 per cent. nitric acid,  or a large wad of wet cotton-wool previously rolled in silver sand, must  be shaken around the interior of the flask, after which rinse thoroughly  with clean water, dry, and polish.      ~Infected Pipettes.~--    1. Plunge infected pipettes immediately after use into tall glass  cylinders containing a 2 per cent. solution of lysol, and allow them to  remain therein for some days.    2. Remove from the jar and drain. Boil in water to which a little soap  has been added, for thirty minutes.    3. Rinse thoroughly in cold water.    4. Immerse in 5 per cent. nitric acid for an hour or two.    5. Rinse again in running water to remove all traces of acid.    6. Complete the cleaning as described under \"new pipettes.\"    When dealing with graduated capillary pipettes employed for blood or  serum work (whether new or infected), much time is consumed in the  various steps from 5 onward, and the cleansing process can be materially  hastened if the following device is adopted.    Fit up a large-sized Kitasato's filter flask to a Sprengel's suction  pump or a Geryk air pump (see page 43). To the side tubulure of the  filter flask attach a 20 cm."]]]
