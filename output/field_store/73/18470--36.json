For statistical series on GDP and other economic  variables, see the Handbook of International Economic  Statistics available from the same sources as The World  Factbook.    GDP--composition by sector: This entry gives the percentage  contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total  GDP.    GDP--per capita: This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power  parity basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same  year.    GDP--real growth rate: This entry gives GDP growth on an  annual basis adjusted for inflation and expressed as a  percent.    Geographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude  and longitude figures for the purpose of finding the  approximate geographic center of an entity and is based on  the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August  1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.    Geographic names: This information is presented in Appendix  H: Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names which indicates  where various geographic names--including alternate names,  former names, political or geographical portions of larger  entities, and the location of all US Foreign Service  posts--can be found in The World Factbook. Spellings are  normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included in  parentheses, while additional information is included in  brackets.    Geography: This category includes the entries dealing with  the natural environment and the effects of human activity.    Geography--note: This entry includes miscellaneous geographic  information of significance not included elsewhere.    GNP: Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final  goods and services produced within a nation in a given year,  plus income earned by its citizens abroad, minus income  earned by foreigners from domestic production. The Factbook,  following current practice, uses GDP rather than GNP to  measure national production. However, the user must realize  that in certain countries net remittances from citizens  working abroad may be important to national well-being.    Government: This category includes the entries dealing with  the system for the adoption and administration of public  policy.    Government type: This entry gives the basic form of  government (e.g., republic, constitutional monarchy, federal  republic, parliamentary democracy, military dictatorship).    Government--note: This entry includes miscellaneous  government information of significance not included  elsewhere.    Gross domestic product: see GDP    Gross national product: see GNP    Gross world product: see GWP    GWP: This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or  aggregate value of all final goods and services produced  worldwide in a given year.    Heliports: This entry gives the total number of established  helicopter takeoff and landing sites (which may or may not  have fuel or other services).    Highways: This entry includes the total length of the  highway system as well as the length of the paved and  unpaved components.    Household income or consumption by percentage share: Data on  household income or consumption come from household surveys,  the results adjusted for household size. Nations use  different standards and procedures in collecting and  adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will normally  show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on  consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time,  yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country  comparisons.    Illicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five  categories of illicit drugs--narcotics, stimulants,  depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These  categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced  and sold outside of medical channels.    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which  provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and  includes marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer),  tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and  hashish oil (hash oil).    Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that  contain the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to  be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is  used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.    Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca  bush.    Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and  anxiety and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal,  Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium,  Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden),  and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).    Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,  mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.    Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical  substance that results in physical, mental, emotional, or  behavioral impairment in an individual.    Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,  self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD  (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons,  cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine  (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy,  TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).    Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp  plant (Cannabis sativa).    Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.    Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical  depressant.    Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).    Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as  mandrax in Southwest Asia.    Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep,  and refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic  substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium (paregoric,  parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine  (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),  and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse,  smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics  include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),  methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon,  Lomotil).    Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe  seedpod of the opium poppy.    Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the  natural and semisynthetic narcotics.    Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the  mature, dried opium poppy.    Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of  Catha edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.    Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone,  a pharmaceutical depressant.    Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase  energy and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow,  crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine  (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,  Sanorex, Tenuate).    Imports: This entry provides the total US dollar amount of  imports on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight)or f.o.b.  (free on board) basis.    Imports--commodities: This entry provides a rank ordering of  imported products starting with the most important; it  sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.    Imports--partners: This entry provides a rank ordering of  trading partners starting with the most important; it  sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.    Independence: For most countries, this entry gives the date  that sovereignty was achieved, and from which nation,  empire, or trusteeship. For the other countries, the date  given may not represent \"independence\" in the strict sense,  but rather some significant nationhood event such as  traditional founding date, date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form  of government, or state succession. Dependent areas include  the notation \"none\" followed by the nature of their  dependency status. Also see the Terminology note.    Industrial production growth rate: This entry gives the  annual percentage increase in industrial production  (includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).    Industries: This entry provides a rank ordering of  industries starting with the largest by value of annual  output.    Infant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths  of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live  births in the same year. This rate is often used an  indicator of the level of health in a country.    Inflation rate (consumer prices): This entry furnishes the  annual percent change in consumer prices compared with the  previous year's consumer prices.    International disputes: see Disputes--international    International organization participation: This entry lists  in alphabetical order by abbreviation those international  organizations in which the subject country is a member or  participates in some other way.    International organizations: This information is presented  in Appendix C: International Organizations and Groups which  includes the name, abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX,  date established, aim, and members by category.    Introduction: This category includes one entry, Background.  At present it appears in only a few country profiles, but  will be added to others in the future.    Irrigated land: This entry gives the number of square  kilometers of land area that is artificially supplied with  water.    Judicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the  highest court(s) and a brief description of the selection  process for members.    Labor force: This entry contains the total labor force  figure.    Labor force--by occupation: This entry contains a rank  ordering of component parts of the labor force by  occupation.
