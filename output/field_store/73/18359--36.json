After what has been said as to the Saros and its use it might be  supposed that a correct list of eclipses for 18.03 years would suffice  for all ordinary purposes of eclipse prediction, and that the sequence  of eclipses at any future time might be ascertained by adding to some  one eclipse which had already happened so many Saros periods as might  embrace the years future whose eclipses it was desired to study. This  would be true in a sense, but would not be literally and effectively  true, because corresponding eclipses do not recur exactly under the same  conditions, for there are small residual discrepancies in the times and  circumstances affecting the real movements of the Earth and Moon and the  apparent movement of the Sun which, in the lapse of years and centuries,  accumulate sufficiently to dislocate what otherwise would be exact  coincidences. Thus an eclipse of the Moon which in A.D. 565 was of 6  digits[7] was in 583 of 7 digits, and in 601 nearly 8. In 908 the  eclipse became total, and remained so for about twelve periods, or until  1088. This eclipse continued to diminish until the beginning of the 15th  century, when it disappeared in 1413. Let us take now the life of an  eclipse of the Sun. One appeared at the North Pole in June A.D. 1295,  and showed itself more and more towards the S. at each subsequent  period. On August 27, 1367, it made its first appearance in the North of  Europe; in 1439 it was visible all over Europe; in 1601, being its 19th  appearance, it was central and annular in England; on May 5, 1818, it  was visible in London, and again on May 15, 1836. Its three next  appearances were on May 26, 1854, June 6, 1872, and June 17, 1890. At  its 39th appearance, on August 10, 1980, the Moon's shadow will have  passed the equator, and as the eclipse will take place nearly at  midnight (Greenwich M.T.), the phenomenon will be invisible in Europe,  Africa, and Asia. At every succeeding period the central line of the  eclipse will lie more and more to the S., until finally, on September  30, 2665, which will be its 78th appearance, it will vanish at the South  Pole.[8]    The operation of the Saros effects which have been specified above, may  be noticed in some of the groups of eclipses which have been much in  evidence (as will appear from a subsequent chapter), during the second  half of the 19th century. The following are two noteworthy Saros groups  of Solar eclipses:--        1842  July  8.    |    1850  Aug.   7.      1860   \"   18.    |    1868   \"    17.      1878   \"   29.    |    1886   \"    29.      1896  Aug.  9.    |    1904  Sept.  9.    If the curious reader will trace, by means of the _Nautical Almanac_  (or some other Almanac which deals with eclipses in adequate detail),  the geographical distribution of the foregoing eclipses on the Earth's  surface, he will see that they fulfil the statement made on p. 24  (_ante_), that a Saros eclipse when it reappears, does so in regions of  the Earth averaging 120 deg. of longitude to the W. of those in which it  had, on the last preceding occasion, been seen; and also that it  gradually works northwards or southwards.    But a given Saros eclipse in its successive reappearances undergoes  other transformations besides that of Terrestrial longitude. These are  well set forth by Professor Newcomb[9]:--    \"Since every successive recurrence of such an eclipse throws the  conjunction 28' further toward the W. of the node, the conjunction must,  in process of time, take place so far back from the node that no eclipse  will occur, and the series will end. For the same reason there must be a  commencement to the series, the first eclipse being E. of the node. A  new eclipse thus entering will at first be a very small one, but will be  larger at every recurrence in each Saros. If it is an eclipse of the  Moon, it will be total from its 13th until its 36th recurrence. There  will be then about 13 partial eclipses, each of which will be smaller  than the last, when they will fail entirely, the conjunction taking  place so far from the node that the Moon does not touch the Earth's  shadow. The whole interval of time over which a series of lunar eclipses  thus extend will be about 48 periods, or 865 years. When a series of  solar eclipses begins, the penumbra of the first will just graze the  earth not far from one of the poles. There will then be, on the average,  11 or 12 partial eclipses of the Sun, each larger than the preceding  one, occurring at regular intervals of one Saros. Then the central line,  whether it be that of a total or annular eclipse, will begin to touch  the Earth, and we shall have a series of 40 or 50 central eclipses. The  central line will strike near one pole in the first part of the series;  in the equatorial regions about the middle of the series, and will leave  the Earth by the other pole at the end. Ten or twelve partial eclipses  will follow, and this particular series will cease.\"    These facts deserve to be expanded a little.    We have seen that all eclipses may be grouped in a series, and that 18  years or thereabouts is the duration of each series, or Saros cycle. But  these cycles are themselves subject to cycles, so that the Saros itself  passes through a cycle of about 64 Saroses before the conditions under  which any given start was made, come quite round again. Sixty-four times  18 make 1152, so that the duration of a Solar eclipse Great Cycle may be  taken at about 1150 years. The progression of such a series across the  face of the Earth is thus described by Mrs. Todd, who gives a very clear  account of the matter:--    \"The advent of a slight partial eclipse near either pole of the Earth  will herald the beginning of the new series. At each succeeding return  conformably to the Saros, the partial eclipse will move a little further  towards the opposite pole, its magnitude gradually increasing for about  200 years, but during all this time only the lunar penumbra will impinge  upon the Earth. But when the true shadow begins to touch, the  obscuration will have become annular or total near the pole where it  first appeared. The eclipse has now acquired a track, which will cross  the Earth slightly farther from that pole every time it returns, for  about 750 years. At the conclusion of this interval, the shadow path  will have reached the opposite pole; the eclipse will then become  partial again, and continue to grow smaller and smaller for about 200  years additional. The series then ceases to exist, its entire duration  having been about 1150 years. The series of \"great eclipses\" of which  two occurred in 1865 and 1883, while others will happen in 1901, 1919,  1937, 1955, and 1973, affords an excellent instance of the northward  progression of eclipse tracks; and another series, with totality nearly  as great (1850, 1868, 1886, 1904, and 1922), is progressing slowly  southwards.\"    The word \"Digit,\" formerly used in connection with eclipses, requires  some explanation. The origin of the word is obvious enough, coming as it  does from the Latin word _Digitus_, a finger. But as human beings have  only eight fingers and two thumbs it is by no means clear how the word  came to be used for twelfths of the disc of the Sun or Moon instead of  tenths. However, such was the case; and when a 16th-century astronomer  spoke of an eclipse of six digits, he meant that one-half of the  luminary in question, be it Sun or Moon, was covered. The earliest use  of the word \"Digit\" in this connection was to refer to the twelfth part  of the visible _surface_ of the Sun or Moon; but before the word went  out of use, it came to be applied to twelfths of the visible _diameter_  of the disc of the Sun or Moon, which was much more convenient. However,  the word is now almost obsolete in both senses, and partial eclipses,  alike of the Sun and of the Moon, are defined in decimal parts of the  diameter of the luminary--tenths or hundredths according to the amount of  precision which is aimed at. Where an eclipse of the Moon is described  as being of more than 12 Digits or more than 1.0 (= 1 diameter) it is to  be understood that the eclipse will be (or was) not only total, but that  the Moon will be (or was) immersed in the Earth's shadow with a more or  less considerable extent of shadow encompassing it.    There are some further matters which require to be mentioned connected  with the periodicity of eclipses. To use a phrase which is often  employed, there is such a thing as an \"Eclipse Season,\" and what this is  can only be adequately comprehended by looking through a catalogue of  eclipses for a number of years arranged in a tabular form, and by  collating the months or groups of months in which batches of eclipses  occur. This is not an obvious matter to the casual purchaser of an  almanac, who, feeling just a slight interest in the eclipses of a coming  new year, dips into his new purchase to see what those eclipses will be.  A haphazard glance at the almanacs of even two or three successive years  will probably fail to bring home to him the idea that each year has its  own eclipse season in which eclipses may occur, and that eclipses are  not to be looked for save at two special epochs, which last about a  month each, and which are separated from one another and from the  eclipse seasons of the previous and of the following years by intervals  of about six months, within a few days more or less. Such, however, is  the case. A little thought will soon make it clear why such should be  the case. We have already seen that the Moon's orbit, like that of every  other planetary member of the Solar System, has two crossing places with  respect to the ecliptic which are called \"Nodes.\" We know also that the  apparent motion of the Sun causes that body to traverse the whole of the  ecliptic in the course of the year. The conjoint result of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24236"],[0,"Time and Tide: A Romance of the Moon (#4)"],[1,"as harmonic analysis. The principle of the  method may be very simply described. Let us fix our attention on any  particular \"tide,\" for so the various elements are denoted. We can  always determine beforehand, with as much accuracy as we may require,  what the period of that tide will be. For instance, the period of the  lunar semi-diurnal tide will of course be half the average time  occupied by the moon to travel round from the meridian of any place  until it regains the same meridian; the period of the lunar diurnal  tide will be double as great; and there are fortnightly tides, and  others of periods still greater. The essential point to notice is,  that the periods of these tides are given by purely astronomical  considerations from the periods of the motions theory, and do not  depend upon the actual observations.    We measure off on the curve the height of the tide at intervals of an  hour. The larger the number of such measures that are available the  better; but even if there be only three hundred and sixty or seven  hundred and twenty consecutive hours, then, as shown by Professor G.  H. Darwin in the _Admiralty Manual_ already referred to, it will  still be possible to obtain a very competent knowledge of the tides in  the particular port where the gauge has been placed.    The art (for such indeed it may be described) of harmonic analysis  consists in deducing from the hourly observations the facts with  regard to each of the constituent tides. This art has been carried to  such perfection, that it has been reduced to a very simple series of  arithmetical operations. Indeed it has now been found possible to call  in the aid of ingenious mechanism, by which the labours of computation  are entirely superseded. The pointer of the harmonic analyzer has  merely to be traced over the curve which the tide-gauge has drawn, and  it is the function of the machine to decompose the composite  undulation into its parts, and to exhibit the several constituent  tides whose confluence gives the total result.    As if nothing should be left to complete the perfection of a process  which, both from its theoretical and its practical sides, is of such  importance, a machine for predicting tides has been designed,  constructed, and is now in ordinary use. When by the aid of the  harmonic analysis the effectiveness of the several constituent tides  affecting a port have become fully determined, it is of course  possible to predict the tides for that port. Each \"tide\" is a simple  periodic rise and fall, and we can compute for any future time the  height of each were it acting alone. These heights can all be added  together, and thus the height of the water is obtained. In this way a  tide-table is formed, and such a table when complete will express not  alone the hours and heights of high water on every day, but the height  of the water at any intervening hour.    The computations necessary for this purpose are no doubt simple, so  far as their principle is concerned; but they are exceedingly tedious,  and any process must be welcomed which affords mitigation of a task so  laborious. The entire theory of the tides owes much to Sir William  Thomson in the methods of observation and in the methods of reduction.  He has now completed the practical parts of the subject by inventing  and constructing the famous tide-predicting engine.    The principle of this engine is comparatively simple. There is a chain  which at one end is fixed, and at the other end carries the pencil  which is pressed against the revolving drum on which the prediction is  to be inscribed. Between its two ends the chain passes up and down  over pulleys. Each pulley corresponds to one of the \"tides,\" and there  are about a dozen altogether, some of which exercise but little  effect. Of course if the centres of the pulleys were all fixed the pen  could not move, but the centre of each pulley describes a circle with  a radius proportional to the amplitude of the corresponding tide, and  in a time proportional to the period of that tide. When these pulleys  are all set so as to start at the proper phases, the motion is  produced by turning round a handle which makes the drum rotate, and  sets all the pulleys in motion. The tide curve is thus rapidly drawn  out; and so expeditious is the machine, that the tides of a port for  an entire year can be completely worked out in a couple of hours.    While the student or the philosopher who seeks to render any account  of the tide on dynamical grounds is greatly embarrassed by the  difficulties introduced by friction, we, for our present purpose in  the study of the great romance of modern science opened up to us by  the theory of the tides, have to welcome friction as the agent which  gives to the tides their significance from our point of view.    There is the greatest difference between the height of the rise and  fall of the tide at different localities. Out in mid-ocean, for  instance, an island like St. Helena is washed by a tide only about  three feet in range; an enclosed sea like the Caspian is subject to no  appreciable tides whatever, while the Mediterranean, notwithstanding  its connection with the Atlantic, is still only subject to very  inconsiderable tides, varying from one foot to a few feet. The  statement that water always finds its own level must be received, like  many another proposition in nature, with a considerable degree of  qualification. Long ere one tide could have found its way through the  Straits of Gibraltar in sufficient volume to have appreciably affected  the level of the great inland sea, its effects would have been  obliterated by succeeding tides. On the other hand, there are certain  localities which expose a funnel-shape opening to the sea; into these  the great tidal wave rushes, and as it passes onwards towards the  narrow part, the waters become piled up so as to produce tidal  phenomena of abnormal proportions. Thus, in our own islands, we have  in the Bristol Channel a wide mouth into which a great tide enters,  and as it hurries up the Severn it produces the extraordinary  phenomenon of the Bore. The Bristol Channel also concentrates the  great wave which gives Chepstow and Cardiff a tidal range of  thirty-seven or thirty-eight feet at springs, and forces the sea up  the river Avon so as to give Bristol a wonderful tide. There is hardly  any more interesting spot in our islands for the observation of tides  than is found on Clifton Suspension Bridge. From that beautiful  structure you look down on a poor and not very attractive stream,  which two hours later becomes transformed into a river of ample  volume, down which great ships are navigated. But of all places in the  world, the most colossal tidal phenomena are those in the Bay of  Fundy. Here the Atlantic passes into a long channel whose sides  gradually converge. When the great pulse of the tide rushes up this  channel, it is gradually accumulated into a mighty volume at the  upper end, the ebb and flow of which at spring tides extends through  the astonishing range of not less than fifty feet.    These discrepancies between the tides at different places are chiefly  due to the local formations of the coasts and the sea-beds. Indeed, it  seems that if the whole earth were covered with an uniform and deep  ocean of water, the tides would be excessively feeble. On no other  supposition can we reasonably account for the fact that our barometric  records fail to afford us any very distinct evidence as to the  existence of tides in the atmosphere. For you will, of course,  remember that our atmosphere may be regarded as a deep and vast ocean  of air, which embraces the whole earth, extending far above the  loftiest summits of the mountains.    It is one of the profoundest of nature's laws that wherever friction  takes place, energy has to be consumed. Perhaps I ought rather to say  transformed, for of course it is now well known that consumption of  energy in the sense of absolute loss is impossible. Thus, when energy  is expended in moving a body in opposition to the force of friction,  or in agitating a liquid, the energy which disappears in its  mechanical form reappears in the form of heat. The agitation of water  by paddles moving through it warms the water, and the accession of  heat thus acquired measures the energy which has been expended in  making the paddles rotate. The motion of a liquid of which the  particles move among each other with friction, can only be sustained  by the incessant degradation of energy from the mechanical form into  the lower form of diffused heat. Thus the very fact that the tides are  ebbing and flowing, and that there is consequently incessant friction  going on among all the particles of water in the ocean, shows us that  there must be some great store of energy constantly available to  supply the incessant draughts made upon it by the daily oscillation of  the tides. In addition to the mere friction between the particles of  water, there are also many other ways in which the tides proclaim to  us that there is some great hoard of energy which is continually  accessible to their wants. Stand on the bank of an estuary or river up  and down which a great tidal current ebbs and flows; you will see the  water copiously charged with sediment which the tide is bearing along.  Engineers are well aware of the potency of the tide as a vehicle for  transporting stupendous quantities of sand or mud. A sand-bank impedes  the navigation of a river; the removal of that sand-bank would be a  task, perhaps, conceivably possible by the use of steam dredges and  other appliances, whereby vast quantities of sand could be raised and  transported to another locality where they would be innocuous. It is  sometimes possible to effect the desired end by applying the power of  the tide. A sea-wall judiciously thrown out will sometimes concentrate  the tide into a much narrower channel.
