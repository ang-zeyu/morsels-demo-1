USES OF THE ELECTRICAL DEVICES.--While all this is progressing and our  factory is turning out an amazing variety of useful articles, we are led  to inquire into the uses to which we may devote our surplus electricity.  The current may be diverted for boiling water; for welding metals; for  heating sad-irons, as well as for other purposes which are daily  required.    TOOLS.--To do these things tools are necessary, and for the present they  should not be expensive. A small, rigidly built bench is the first  requirement. This may be made, as shown in Fig. 1, of three 2-inch  planks, each 10 inches wide and 6 feet long, mounted on legs 36 inches  in height. In the front part are three drawers for your material, or the  small odds and ends, as well as for such little tools as you may  accumulate. Then you will need a small vise, say, with a 2-inch jaw, and  you will also require a hand reel for winding magnets. This will be  fully described hereafter.    You can also, probably, get a small, cheap anvil, which will be of the  greatest service in your work. It should be mounted close up to the work  bench. Two small hammers, one with an A-shaped peon, and the other with  a round peon, should be selected, and also a plane and a small wood saw  with fine teeth. A bit stock, or a ratchet drill, if you can afford it,  with a variety of small drills; two wood chisels, say of 3/8-inch and  3/4-inch widths; small cold chisels; hack saw, 10-inch blade; small  iron square; pair of dividers; tin shears; wire cutters; 2 pairs of  pliers, one flat and the other round-nosed; 2 awls, centering punch,  wire cutters, and, finally, soldering tools.    [Illustration: _Fig. 2. Top View_ MAGNET-WINDING REEL]    [Illustration: _Fig. 3. Side View_ MAGNET-WINDING REEL]    If a gas stove is not available, a brazing torch is an essential tool.  Numerous small torches are being made, which are cheap and easily  operated. A small soldering iron, with pointed end, should be provided;  also metal shears and a small square; an awl and several sizes of  gimlets; a screwdriver; pair of pliers and wire cutters.    From the foregoing it will be seen that the cost of tools is not a very  expensive item.    This entire outfit, not including the anvil and vise, may be purchased  new for about $20.00, so we have not been extravagant.    MAGNET-WINDING REEL.--Some little preparation must be made, so we may be  enabled to handle our work by the construction of mechanical aids.    [Illustration: _Fig. 4. Journal Block._]    First of these is the magnet-winding reel, a plan view of which is shown  in Fig. 2. This, for our present work, will be made wholly of wood.    Select a plank 1-1/2 inches thick and 8 inches wide, and from this cut  off two pieces (A), each 7 inches long, and then trim off the corners  (B, B), as shown in Fig. 4. To serve as the mandrel (C, Fig. 2), select  a piece of broomstick 9 inches long. Bore a hole (D) in each block (A) a  half inch below the upper margin of the block, this hole being of such  diameter that the broomstick mandrel will fit and easily turn therein.    Place a crank (E), 5 inches long, on the outer end of the mandrel, as in  Fig. 3. Then mount one block on the end of the bench and the other block  3 inches away. Affix them to the bench by nails or screws, preferably  the latter.    On the inner end of the mandrel put a block (F) of hard wood. This is  done by boring a hole 1 inch deep in the center of the block, into which  the mandrel is driven. On the outer face of the block is a square hole  large enough to receive the head of a 3/8-inch bolt, and into the  depression thus formed a screw (G) is driven through the block and into  the end of the mandrel, so as to hold the block (F) and mandrel firmly  together. When these parts are properly put together, the inner side of  the block will rest and turn against the inner journal block (A).    The tailpiece is made of a 2\" x 4\" scantling (H), 10 inches long, one  end of it being nailed to a transverse block (I) 2\" x 2\" x 4\". The inner  face of this block has a depression in which is placed a V-shaped cup  (J), to receive the end of the magnet core (K) or bolt, which is to be  used for this purpose. The tailpiece (H) has a longitudinal slot (L) 5  inches long adapted to receive a 1/2-inch bolt (M), which passes down  through the bench, and is, therefore, adjustable, so it may be moved to  and from the journal bearing (A), thereby providing a place for the  bolts to be put in. These bolts are the magnet cores (K), 6 inches long,  but they may be even longer, if you bore several holes (N) through the  bench so you may set over the tailpiece.    With a single tool made substantially like this, over a thousand of the  finest magnets have been wound. Its value will be appreciated after you  have had the experience of winding a few magnets.    ORDER IN THE WORKSHOP.--Select a place for each tool on the rear upright  of the bench, and make it a rule to put each tool back into its place  after using. This, if persisted in, will soon become a habit, and will  save you hours of time. Hunting for tools is the unprofitable part of  any work.          CHAPTER III    MAGNETS, COILS, ARMATURES, ETC.      THE TWO KINDS OF MAGNET.--Generally speaking, magnets are of two kinds,  namely, permanent and electro-magnetic.    PERMANENT MAGNETS.--A permanent magnet is a piece of steel in which an  electric force is exerted at all times. An electro-magnet is a piece of  iron which is magnetized by a winding of wire, and the magnet is  energized only while a current of electricity is passing through the  wire.    ELECTRO-MAGNET.--The electro-magnet, therefore, is the more useful,  because the pull of the magnet can be controlled by the current which  actuates it.    The electro-magnet is the most essential of all contrivances in the  operation and use of electricity. It is the piece of mechanism which  does the physical work of almost every electrical apparatus or machine.  It is the device which has the power to convert the unseen electric  current into motion which may be observed by the human eye. Without it  electricity would be a useless agent to man.    While the electro-magnet is, therefore, the form of device which is  almost wholly used, it is necessary, first, to understand the principles  of the permanent magnet.    MAGNETISM.--The curious force exerted by a magnet is called magnetism,  but its origin has never been explained. We know its manifestations  only, and laws have been formulated to explain its various phases; how  to make it more or less intense; how to make its pull more effective;  the shape and form of the magnet and the material most useful in its  construction.    [Illustration: _Fig 5._ PLAIN MAGNET BAR]    MATERIALS FOR MAGNETS.--Iron and steel are the best materials for  magnets. Some metals are non-magnetic, this applying to iron if combined  with manganese. Others, like sulphur, zinc, bismuth, antimony, gold,  silver and copper, not only are non-magnetic, but they are actually  repelled by magnetism. They are called the diamagnetics.    NON-MAGNETIC MATERIALS.--Any non-magnetic body in the path of a magnetic  force does not screen or diminish its action, whereas a magnetic  substance will.    In Fig. 5 we show the simplest form of magnet, merely a bar of steel (A)  with the magnetic lines of force passing from end to end. It will be  understood that these lines extend out on all sides, and not only along  two sides, as shown in the drawing. The object is to explain clearly how  the lines run.    [Illustration: _Fig. 6._ SEVERED MAGNET]    ACTION OF A SEVERED MAGNET.--Now, let us suppose that we sever this bar  in the middle, as in Fig. 6, or at any other point between the ends. In  this case each part becomes a perfect magnet, and a new north pole (N)  and a new south pole (S) are made, so that the movement of the magnetic  lines of force are still in the same direction in each--that is, the  current flows from the north pole to the south pole.    WHAT NORTH AND SOUTH POLES MEAN.--If these two parts are placed close  together they will attract each other. But if, on the other hand, one of  the pieces is reversed, as in Fig. 7, they will repel each other. From  this comes the statement that likes repel and unlikes attract each  other.    REPULSION AND ATTRACTION.--This physical act of repulsion and attraction  is made use of in motors, as we shall see hereinafter.    It will be well to bear in mind that in treating of electricity the  north pole is always associated with the plus sign (+) and the south  pole with the minus sign (-). Or the N sign is positive and the S sign  negative electricity.    [Illustration: _Fig. 7._ REVERSED MAGNETS]    POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES.--There is really no difference between positive  and negative electricity, so called, but the foregoing method merely  serves as a means of identifying or classifying the opposite ends of a  magnet or of a wire.    MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE.--It will be noticed that the magnetic lines of  force pass through the bar and then go from end to end through the  atmosphere. Air is a poor conductor of electricity, so that if we can  find a shorter way to conduct the current from the north pole to the  south pole, the efficiency of the magnet is increased.    This is accomplished by means of the well-known horseshoe magnet, where  the two ends (N, S) are brought close together, as in Fig. 8.    THE EARTH AS A MAGNET.--The earth is a huge magnet and the magnetic  lines run from the north pole to the south pole around all sides of the  globe.    [Illustration: _Fig. 8._ HORSESHOE MAGNET]    The north magnetic pole does not coincide with the true north pole or  the pivotal point of the earth's rotation, but it is sufficiently near  for all practical purposes.

In selecting any breed, regard should be had to the circumstances of the  individual farmer and the object to be pursued. The cow most profitable  for the milk dairy, may be very unprofitable in the butter and cheese  dairy, as well as for the production of beef; while, for either of the  latter objects, the cow which gave the largest quantity of milk might be  very undesirable. A union and harmony of all good qualities must be  secured, so far as possible. The farmer wants a cow that will milk well  for some years; and then, when dry, fatten readily and sell to the  butcher for the highest price. These qualities, often supposed to be  utterly incompatible, will be found united in some breeds to a greater  extent than in others; while some peculiarities of form have been  found, by observation, to be better adapted to the production of milk  and beef than others.    It is proposed, therefore, to sketch the pure breeds now found in  America.      THE AYRSHIRE.    [Illustration: AN AYRSHIRE BULL.]    This breed is justly celebrated throughout Great Britain and this  country for its excellent dairy qualities. Though the most recent in  their origin, they are pretty distinct from the Scotch and English  races. In color, the pure Ayrshires are generally red and  white, spotted or mottled, not roan like many of the short horns, but  often presenting a bright contrast of colors. They are sometimes, though  rarely, nearly or quite all red, and sometimes black and white; but the  favorite color is red and white brightly contrasted; and, by some,  strawberry-color is preferred. The head is small, fine and clean; the  face long and narrow at the muzzle, with a sprightly, yet generally mild  expression; eye small, smart and lively; the horns short, fine, and  slightly twisted upward, set wide apart at the roots; the neck thin;  body enlarging from fore to hind quarters; the back straight and narrow,  but broad across the loin; joints rather loose and open; ribs rather  flat; hind quarters rather thin; bone fine; tail long, fine, and bushy  at the end; hair generally thin and soft; udder light color and  capacious, extending well forward under the belly; teats of the cow of  medium size, generally set regularly and wide apart; milk-veins  prominent and well developed. The carcass of the pure bred Ayrshire is  light, particularly the fore quarters, which is considered by good  judges as an index of great milking qualities; but the pelvis is  capacious and wide over the hips.    On the whole, the Ayrshire is good looking, but wants some of the  symmetry and aptitude to fatten which characterize the short horn, which  is supposed to have contributed to build up this valuable breed on the  basis of the original stock of the county of Ayr, which extends along  the eastern shore of the Firth of Clyde, in the southwestern part of  Scotland.    The original stock of this country are described as of a diminutive  size, ill fed, ill shaped, and yielding but a scanty return in milk.  They were mostly of a black color, with large stripes of white along the  chine and ridge of their backs, about the flanks, and on their faces.  Their horns were high and crooked, having deep ringlets at the root--the  surest proof that they were but scantily fed; the chine of their backs  stood up high and narrow; their sides were lank, short, and thin; their  hides thick and adhering to the bones; their pile was coarse and open;  and few of them gave more than six or eight quarts of milk a day when in  their best condition, or weighed, when fat, more than from a hundred to  a hundred and sixty pounds avoirdupois, rejecting offal.    A wonderful change has since been made in the condition, aspect, and  qualities of the Ayrshire dairy stock. They are now almost double the  size, and yield about four times the quantity of milk that the Ayrshire  cows formerly yielded. A large part of this improvement is due to better  feeding and care, but much, no doubt, to judicious crossing. Strange as  it may seem, considering the modern origin of this breed, all that is  certainly known touching it is, that about a century and a half ago  there was no such breed as Ayrshire in Scotland. The question has  therefore arisen, whether these cattle came entirely from a careful  selection of the best native breed. If they did, it is a circumstance  without a parallel in the history of agriculture. The native breed may  indeed be ameliorated by careful selection; its value may be  incalculably increased; some good qualities, some of its best qualities,  may be developed for the first time; but yet there will be some  resemblance to the original stock, and the more the animal is examined,  the more clearly can be traced the characteristic points of the  ancestor, although every one of them is improved.    Youatt estimates the daily yield of an Ayrshire cow, for the first two  or three months after calving, at five gallons a day, on an average; for  the next three months, at three gallons; and for the next four months,  at one gallon and a half. This would give eight hundred and fifty  gallons as the annual average; but, allowing for some unproductive cows,  he estimates the average of a dairy at six hundred gallons a year for  each cow. Three gallons and a half of the Ayrshire cow's milk will yield  one and a half pounds of butter. Some have estimated the yield still  higher.    One of the four cows originally imported into this country by John P.  Cushing, Esq., of Massachusetts, gave in one year three thousand eight  hundred and sixty-four quarts, beer measure, or about nine hundred and  sixty-six gallons, at ten pounds the gallon; being an average of over  ten and a half beer quarts a day for the entire year. The first cow of  this breed, imported by the Massachusetts Society, for the Promotion of  Agriculture, in 1837, yielded sixteen pounds of butter a week for  several successive weeks, on grass feed only. It should be borne in  mind, in this connection that the climate of New England is less  favorable to the production of milk than that of England and Scotland,  and that no cow imported after arriving at maturity can be expected to  yield as much, under the same circumstances, as one bred on the spot  where the trial is made, and perfectly acclimated.    On excellent authority, the most approved shape and marks of a good  dairy cow are as follows: Head small, long, and narrow toward the  muzzle; horns small, clear, bent, and placed at considerable distance  from each other; eyes not large, but brisk and lively; neck slender and  long, tapering toward the head, with a little loose skin below;  shoulders and fore quarters light and thin; hind quarters large and  broad; back straight, and joints slack and open; carcass deep in the  rib; tail small and long, reaching to the heels; legs small and short,  with firm joints; udder square, but a little oblong, stretching forward,  thin skinned and capacious, but not low hung; teats or paps small,  pointing outward, and at a considerable distance from each other;  milk-veins capacious and prominent; skin loose, thin, and soft like a  glove; hair short, soft, and woolly; general figure, when in flesh,  handsome and well proportioned.    If this description of the Ayrshire cow be correct, it will be seen that  her head and neck are remarkably clean and fine, the latter swelling  gradually toward the shoulders, both parts being unencumbered with  superfluous flesh. The same general form extends backward, the fore  quarters being, light the shoulders thin, and the carcass swelling out  toward the hind quarters, so that when standing in front of her it has  the form of a blunted wedge. Such a structure indicates very fully  developed digestive organs, which exert a powerful influence on all the  functions of the body, and especially on the secretion of the milky  glands, accompanied with milk-veins and udder partaking of the same  character as the stomach and viscera, being large and capacious, while  the external skin and interior walls of the milk-glands are thin and  elastic, and all parts arranged in a manner especially adapted for the  production of milk.    A cow with these marks will generally be of a quiet and docile temper,  which greatly increases her value. A cow that is of a quiet and  contented disposition feeds at ease, is milked with ease, and yields  more than one of an opposite temperament; while, after she is past her  usefulness as a milker, she will easily take on fat, and make fine beef  and a good quantity of tallow, because she feeds freely, and when dry  the food which went to make milk is converted into fat and flesh. But  there is no breed of cows with which gentle gentleness of treatment is  so indispensable as with the Ayrshire, on account of her naturally  nervous temperament. If she receives other than kind and gentle  treatment, she will often resent it with angry looks and gestures, and  withhold her milk; and if such treatment is long continued, will dry  up; but she willingly and easily yields it to the hand that fondles  her, and all her looks and movements toward her friends are quiet and  mild.    The Ayrshires in their native country are generally bred for the dairy,  and for no other object; and the cows have justly obtained a world-wide  reputation for this quality. The oxen are, however, very fair as working  cattle, though they cannot be said to excel other breeds in this  respect. The Ayrshire steer maybe fed and turned at three years old; but  for feeding purposes the Ayrshires are greatly improved by a cross with  the short horns, provided regard is had to the size of the animal. It is  the opinion of good breeders that a high-bred short horn bull and a  large-sized Ayrshire cow will produce a calf which will come to maturity  earlier, and attain greater weight, and sell for more money than a  pure-bred Ayrshire.
