The chief trouble with idleness is that it so often means introspection,  worry, and impatience, especially to those conscientious souls who would  fain be about their business.    I have for a long time been accustomed to combat the worry and fret of  necessary idleness--not by forbidding it, not by advising struggle and  fight against it, but by insisting that the best way to get rid of it is  to leave it alone, to accept it. When we do this there may come a kind  of fallow time in which the mind enriches and refreshes itself beyond  our conception.    I would rather my patient who must rest for a long time would give up  all thought of method, would give up all idea of making his mind follow  any particular line of thought or absence of thought. I know that the  mind which has been under conscious control a good deal of the time is  apt to rebel at this freedom and to indulge in all kinds of alarming  extravagances. I am sure, however, that the best way to meet these  demands for conscious control is to be careless of them, to be willing  to experience these extravagances and inconsistencies without fear, in  the belief that finally will come a quiet and peace which will be all  that we can ask. The peace of mind that is unguided, in the conscious  and literal sense, is a thing which too few of us know.    Mr. Arnold Bennett, in his little book, \"How to Live on Twenty-four  Hours a Day,\" teaches that we should leave no time unused in our lives;  that we should accomplish a great deal more and be infinitely more  effective and progressive if we devoted our minds to the definite  working-out of necessary problems whenever those times occur in which we  are apt to be desultory. I wish here to make a plea for desultoriness  and for an idleness which goes even beyond the idleness of the man who  reads the newspaper and forgets what he has read. It seems to me better,  whether we are sick or well, to allow long periods in our lives when we  think only casually. To the good old adage, \"Work while you work and  play while you play,\" we might well add, \"Rest while you rest,\" lest in  the end you should be unable successfully either to work or play.    A man is not necessarily condemned to tortures of mind because he must  rest for a week or a month or a year. I know that there must be anxious  times, especially when idleness means dependence, and when it brings  hardship to those who need our help. But the invalid must not try  constantly to puzzle the matter out. If we do not make ourselves sick  with worry, we shall be able sometime to approach active life with  sufficient frankness and force. It is the constant effort of the poor,  tired mind to solve its problems that not only fails of its object, but  plunges the invalid deeper into discouragement and misunderstanding. How  cruel this is, and how unfortunate that it should come more commonly to  those who try the hardest to overcome their handicaps, to throw off the  yoke of idleness and to be well.    When you have tried your best to get back to your work and have failed,  when you have done this not once but many times, it is inevitable that  misunderstanding should creep in, inevitable that you should question  very deeply and doubt not infrequently. Yet the chances are that one of  the reasons for your failure is that you have tried too hard, that you  have not known how to rest. When you have learned how to rest, when you  have learned to put off thinking and planning until the mind becomes  fresh and clear, when you are in a fair way to know the joy of idleness  and the peace of rest, you are a great deal more likely to get back to  efficiency and to find your way along the great paths of activity into  the world of life.    It is not so much the idleness, then, as the attempt to overcome its  irksomeness, that makes this condition painful. The invalid in bed is in  a trap, to be tormented by his thoughts unless he knows the meaning of  successful idleness. This knowledge may come to him by such strategy as  I have suggested--by giving up the struggle against worry and fret; but  peace will come surely, steadily, \"with healing in its wings,\" when the  mind is changed altogether, when life becomes free because of a growth  and development that finds significance even in idleness, that sees the  world with wise and patient eyes.    In a way it does not matter, your physical condition or mine, if our  \"eyes have seen the glory\" that deifies life and makes even its waste  places beautiful. What is that view from your window as you lie in your  bed? A bit of the sea, if you are fortunate, a corner of garden, surely,  the top of an elm tree against the blue. What is it but the revelations  of a God in the world? There is enough that is sad and unhappy, but over  all are these simple, ineffable things. If the garden is an expression  of God in the world, then the world and life are no longer meaningless.  Even idleness becomes in some degree bearable because it is a part of a  significant world.    Unfortunately, the idleness of disability often means pain, the wear and  tear of physical or nervous suffering. That is another matter. We cannot  meet it fully with any philosophy. My patients very often beg to know  the best way to bear pain, how they may overcome the attacks of \"nerves\"  that are harder to bear than pain. To such a question I can only say  that the time to bear pain is before and after. Live in such a way in  the times of comparative comfort that the attacks are less likely to  appear and easier to bear when they do come. After the pain or the  \"nervous\" attack is over, that is the time to prevent the worst features  of another. Forget the distress; live simply and happily in spite of the  memory, and you will have done all that the patient himself can do to  ward off or to make tolerable the next occasion of suffering. Pain  itself--pure physical pain--is a matter for the physician's judgment. It  is his business to seek out the causes and apply the remedy.          V    RULES OF THE GAME          It is not growing like a tree      In bulk, doth make man better be.                  BEN JONSON.        It is a good thing to have a sound body, better to have a sane      mind, but neither is to be compared to that aggregate of virile      and decent qualities which we call character.                  THEODORE ROOSEVELT.        The only effective remedy against inexorable necessity is to      yield to it.                  PETRARCH.    When I go about among my patients, most of them, as it happens,  \"nervously\" sick, I sometimes stop to consider why it is they are ill. I  know that some are so because of physical weakness over which they have  no control, that some are suffering from the effects of carelessness,  some from wilfulness, and more from simple ignorance of the rules of the  game. There are so many rules that no one will ever know them all, but  it seems that we live in a world of laws, and that if we transgress  those laws by ever so little, we must suffer equally, whether our  transgression is a mistake or not, and whether we happen to be saints or  sinners. There are laws also which have to do with the recovery of poise  and balance when these have been lost. These laws are less well observed  and understood than those which determine our downfall.    The more gross illnesses, from accident, contagion, and malignancy, we  need not consider here, but only those intangible injuries that disable  people who are relatively sound in the physical sense. It is true that  nervous troubles may cause physical complications and that physical  disease very often coexists with nervous illness, but it is better for  us now to make an artificial separation. Just what happens in the human  economy when a \"nervous breakdown\" comes, nobody seems to know, but mind  and body cooeperate to make the patient miserable and helpless. It may  be nature's way of holding us up and preventing further injury. The  hold-up is severe, usually, and becomes in itself a thing to be managed.    The rules we have wittingly or unwittingly broken are often unknown to  us, but they exist in the All-Wise Providence, and we may guess by our  own suffering how far we have overstepped them. If a man runs into a  door in the dark, we know all about that,--the case is simple,--but if  he runs overtime at his office and hastens to be rich with the result of  a nervous dyspepsia--that is a mystery. Here is a girl who \"came out\"  last year. She was apparently strong and her mother was ambitious for  her social progress. That meant four nights a week for several months at  dances and dinners, getting home at 3 A.M. or later. It was gay and  delightful while it lasted, but it could not last, and the girl went to  pieces suddenly; her back gave out because it was not strong enough to  stand the dancing and the long-continued physical strain. The nerves  gave out because she did not give her faculties time to rest, and  perhaps because of a love affair that supervened. The result was a year  of invalidism, and then, because the rules of recovery were not  understood, several years more of convalescence. Such common rules  should be well enough understood, but they are broken everywhere by the  wisest people.    The common case of the broken-down school teacher is more unfortunate.  This tragedy and others like it are more often, I believe, due to unwise  choice of profession in the first place. The women's colleges are  turning out hundreds of young women every year who naturally consider  teaching as the field most appropriate and available. Probably only a  very small proportion of these girls are strong enough physically or  nervously to meet the growing demands of the schools. They may do well  for a time, some of them unusually well, for it is the sensitive,  high-strung organism that is appreciative and effective."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#4)"],[1,"HAMS.    When the hams have been well pickled, as shown in the preceding Number,  they must be pressed between boards with heavy stones to render them  flat; the hams should remain in press for twenty-four hours; and, at the  end of that time, must be well rubbed all over with peasemeal mixed with  a little salt; they are then to be smoked in a close shed or in the  chimney, burning for that purpose some branches of juniper or any other  wood, and some sawdust. The smoking must last five days. The hams, when  sufficiently smoked, must be kept in a cool place. They will not be ripe  for cooking before six months after their curing. Remember that a couple  of well-cured hams, kept in reserve for a case of need, will always  prove a ready means to realize some twenty-five shillings towards paying  the rent, etc.      No. 32. HOW TO CURE BACON.    Mind that your pickling-trough is well scalded out before using it for  pickling the bacon. Allow at the rate of four ounces of salt to every  pound of meat, and to every ten pounds of salt six ounces of saltpetre,  two ounces of salprunella, and eight ounces of sugar; rub the salt,  etc., well into the bacon every morning for twelve successive days; and  at the end of that time, let the sides of bacon be pressed between  boards with heavy stones placed upon them to keep them flat; and at the  end of twenty-four hours, rub them over with peasemeal in which there  has been mixed a little salt, and smoke the bacon in the same manner as  the hams; and thus, by timely thriftiness, you will be provided with a  meat dinner for a long while.      No. 33. HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE PIG'S PLUCK.    See Nos. 72 and 73.      No. 34. HOW TO MAKE PORK SAUSAGES.    Take equal parts of fat and lean meat, such as the inferior end of the  spare-ribs and some of the loose fat; chop these well together, adding a  few sage leaves, a little thyme, pepper and salt, and one or two eggs;  when the whole is thoroughly mixed and chopped fine, use a sprinkle of  flour on a table or dresser, for the purpose of rolling the sausages  into shape of the size and form of a man's thumb. These sausages may be  fried in the ordinary way.      No. 35. BLACK PUDDINGS.    When a pig is killed, the blood should be caught in a pan, and a little  salt must be stirred in with it while yet warm, to prevent its  coagulation or thickening. This will serve to make you some hog's  puddings, excellent things in their way, and for the preparation of  which you must attend to the following instructions, viz.:--To every  pound of blood, add eight ounces of fat cut up in small squares, two  ounces of rice or grits, boiled quite soft in milk; season with pepper  and salt, chopped sage, thyme, and winter savory, and some chopped  onions boiled soft in a little milk or water; mix all these things well  together, and use a tin funnel for filling in the cleansed guts with the  preparation, taking care to tie the one end of each piece of gut with  string, to prevent waste. The puddings being thus prepared, tie them in  links, each pudding measuring about six inches in length, and when all  are tied, let them be dropped into a pot containing boiling-water, just  taken off the fire, and allow them to remain in this until they become  set, or slightly firm; the puddings must then be carefully lifted out,  and hung to a nail driven into the wall, to drain them from all excess  of moisture; and before they are fried or broiled, they must be slightly  scored with a sharp knife, to prevent them from bursting while they are  being cooked.      No. 36. HOW TO MELT DOWN THE SEAM, OR LOOSE FAT.    Cut up the seam in small pieces, put it into a pot with about a gill of  water, and set it over a slow fire to melt down, stirring it frequently  with a spoon to prevent it from burning; and as soon as all is melted,  let it be strained off into a jar for use. This will produce what is  called lard, and will serve for making lard cakes, pie or pudding  crusts, and also for general cooking purposes, instead of butter, etc.      No. 37. ITALIAN CHEESE.    This is prepared by chopping up the whole of the pig's pluck, the  chitterlings, and a couple of pounds of the fat; mix this in a pan with  seasoning composed of chopped sage, thyme, winter savory, allspice,  pepper, and salt, and with it fill earthen pots or jars having lids to  them; bake the contents in moderate heat; or if you have no oven of your  own, send them to the baker's. A jar containing two pounds would require  about an hour and three-quarters' baking. Italian cheese is to be eaten  cold, spread upon bread.      No. 38. PIG'S FEET.    These are to be well salted for about four days, and then boiled in  plenty of water for about three hours; they may be eaten either hot or  cold.      No. 39. CURRIED RICE.    Boil one or more pounds of rice, as directed in No. 92, and drain all  the water from it; slice some onions very thin, and fry them brown with  a little butter; then add the boiled rice, a spoonful of curry-powder,  and a little salt to season; mix all together. This is excellent with  boiled or fried fish.      No. 40. A PLAIN RICE PUDDING.    To every quart of milk add six ounces of rice, one ounce of brown sugar,  a pinch of allspice, and ditto of salt; put all these in a proper sized  pie-dish, with one ounce of butter, and set the pudding to bake for one  hour and-a-half. When the pudding has been in the oven half an hour,  stir it round with a fork.      No. 41. A GROUND RICE PUDDING.    Ingredients, eight ounces of ground rice, three pints of skim milk, one  ounce of butter, four ounces of sugar, a pinch of allspice or bit of  lemon-peel, a pinch of salt, and two or three eggs; mix all the above  ingredients (except the eggs) in a saucepan, and stir them on the fire  till the batter boils; then beat up the eggs with a fork in a basin, and  mix them well into the rice batter, and pour the whole into a  well-greased pie-dish, and bake the pudding for an hour.      No. 42. A BREAD PUDDING FOR A FAMILY.    Ingredients, a two-pound loaf, two quarts of milk, two ounces of butter,  four ounces of sugar, four ounces of plums or currants, three eggs, a  piece of lemon-peel chopped, and a spoonful of salt. Divide the loaf  into four equal-sized pieces, and soak them in boiling-water for twenty  minutes, then squeeze out the water, and put the bread into a saucepan  with the milk, butter, sugar, lemon-peel, and salt, and stir all  together on the fire till it boils; next add the beaten eggs and the  currants; pour the pudding into a proper sized greased baking-dish, and  bake it for an hour and a-quarter.      No. 43. A BATTER AND FRUIT PUDDING.    Ingredients, two quarts of milk, one pound of flour, four eggs, eight  ounces of sugar, one quart of fruit (either plums, gooseberries,  currants, &c.), one ounce of butter, a good pinch of salt. First, mix  the flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and a pint of the milk, by working all  together in a basin or pan, with a spoon, and when quite smooth, add the  remainder of the milk; work the batter thoroughly, and pour it into a  large pie-dish, greased with the butter; add the fruit, and bake the  pudding for an hour and a-quarter.      No. 44. A TREACLE PUDDING.    Ingredients, two pounds of flour, twelve ounces of treacle, six ounces  of suet or dripping fat, a quarter of an ounce of baking-powder, a pinch  of allspice, a little salt, one pint of milk, or water. Mix the whole of  the above-named ingredients in a pan, into a firm compact paste; tie it  up in a well-greased and floured pudding-cloth; boil the pudding for at  least two hours and a-half, and when done, cut it in slices, and pour a  little sweetened melted butter over it.      No. 45. APPLE PUDDING.    Ingredients, one pound and a-half of flour, six ounces of suet chopped  fine, two pounds of peeled apples, four ounces of sugar, a little salt,  and three gills of water. Mix the flour, suet, and salt with three  quarters of a pint of water into a firm paste; roll this out with flour  shaken over the table, using a rolling-pin to roll it out; and line a  greased cloth, which you have spread in a hollow form within a large  basin, with the rolled-out paste; fill up the hollow part of the paste  with the peeled apples, gather up the sides of the paste in a  purse-like form, and twist them firmly together; tie up the pudding in  the cloth, boil it in plenty of boiling water for two hours, and when it  is turned out of the cloth on to its dish, cut out a round piece from  the top, and stir in the sugar.      No. 46. RICE AND APPLES.    Ingredients, one pound of rice, twelve apples, two ounces of sugar. Tie  up the rice very loose in a pudding-cloth, so as to admit that while  boiling it may have sufficient room to swell out to five times its  original quantity. While the rice is boiling, which will take about one  hour, peel the apples, and put them in a saucepan with nearly  half-a-pint of water, a bit of butter, lemon-peel, and the sugar, and  stew them on the fire till dissolved, stirring them while boiling for a  few minutes. When your rice pudding is done and turned out on its dish,  pour the apple-sauce over it. This cheap kind of rice pudding may also  be eaten with all kinds of fruits, prepared in the same manner as herein  directed for apples.      No. 47. BROWN AND POLSON PUDDING.    Ingredients, six ounces of Brown and Polson's prepared Indian corn, two  quarts of milk, two ounces of sugar, a bit of cinnamon or lemon-peel, a  pinch of salt, three eggs. Mix all the above ingredients (except the  eggs) in a saucepan, and stir them on the fire till they come to a boil;  then add the eggs beat up; mix thoroughly, pour the batter into a  pie-dish greased with butter, and bake the pudding for one hour. Brown  and Polson's prepared Indian corn is a most excellent and economical  article of food, equal to arrow-root, and will prove, on trial, to be  both substantial and nutritive, and"]]]
