Unless we  dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to  believe one of two things: either that Mr. Cave's crystal was in two  worlds at once, and that, while it was carried about in one, it remained  stationary in the other, which seems altogether absurd; or else that it  had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar  crystal in this other world, so that what was seen in the interior of  the one in this world was, under suitable conditions, visible to an  observer in the corresponding crystal in the other world; and _vice  versa_. At present, indeed, we do not know of any way in which two  crystals could so come _en rapport_, but nowadays we know enough to  understand that the thing is not altogether impossible. This view of the  crystals as _en rapport_ was the supposition that occurred to Mr. Wace,  and to me at least it seems extremely plausible....    And where was this other world? On this, also, the alert intelligence of  Mr. Wace speedily threw light. After sunset, the sky darkened  rapidly--there was a very brief twilight interval indeed--and the stars  shone out. They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged in  the same constellations. Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades,  Aldebaran, and Sirius: so that the other world must be somewhere in the  solar system, and, at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions of  miles from our own. Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that the  midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky, and that the  sun seemed a little smaller. _And there were two small moons!_ \"like our  moon but smaller, and quite differently marked\" one of which moved so  rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it. These  moons were never high in the sky, but vanished as they rose: that is,  every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near  their primary planet. And all this answers quite completely, although  Mr. Cave did not know it, to what must be the condition of things on  Mars.    Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into  this crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its  inhabitants. And, if that be the case, then the evening star that shone  so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision, was neither more nor  less than our own familiar earth.    For a time the Martians--if they were Martians--do not seem to have  known of Mr. Cave's inspection. Once or twice one would come to peer,  and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the vision was  unsatisfactory. During this time Mr. Cave was able to watch the  proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their  attentions, and, although his report is necessarily vague and  fragmentary, it is nevertheless very suggestive. Imagine the impression  of humanity a Martian observer would get who, after a difficult process  of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes, was able to  peer at London from the steeple of St. Martin's Church for stretches, at  longest, of four minutes at a time. Mr. Cave was unable to ascertain if  the winged Martians were the same as the Martians who hopped about the  causeways and terraces, and if the latter could put on wings at will. He  several times saw certain clumsy bipeds, dimly suggestive of apes, white  and partially translucent, feeding among certain of the lichenous trees,  and once some of these fled before one of the hopping, round-headed  Martians. The latter caught one in its tentacles, and then the picture  faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most tantalisingly in the dark. On  another occasion a vast thing, that Mr. Cave thought at first was some  gigantic insect, appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal  with extraordinary rapidity. As this drew nearer Mr. Cave perceived that  it was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity.  And then, when he looked again, it had passed out of sight.    After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the Martians,  and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to  the crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and they immediately  turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of  signalling. But when at last Mr. Cave examined the crystal again the  Martian had departed.    Thus far these observations had progressed in early November, and then  Mr. Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal  were allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order that, as  occasion arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort himself with  what was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence.    In December Mr. Wace's work in connection with a forthcoming examination  became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week, and  for ten or eleven days--he is not quite sure which--he saw nothing of  Cave. He then grew anxious to resume these investigations, and, the  stress of his seasonal labours being abated, he went down to Seven  Dials. At the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier's  window, and then another at a cobbler's. Mr. Cave's shop was closed.    He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black. He at once  called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe, in cheap but  ample widow's weeds of the most imposing pattern. Without any very  great surprise Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead and already buried.  She was in tears, and her voice was a little thick. She had just  returned from Highgate. Her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects  and the honourable details of the obsequies, but Mr. Wace was at last  able to learn the particulars of Cave's death. He had been found dead in  his shop in the early morning, the day after his last visit to Mr. Wace,  and the crystal had been clasped in his stone-cold hands. His face was  smiling, said Mrs. Cave, and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on  the floor at his feet. He must have been dead five or six hours when he  was found.    This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach himself  bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man's  ill-health. But his chief thought was of the crystal. He approached that  topic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave's peculiarities.  He was dumbfoundered to learn that it was sold.    Mrs. Cave's first impulse, directly Cave's body had been taken upstairs,  had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for  the crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a violent hunt in  which her daughter joined her, they were convinced of the loss of his  address. As they were without the means required to mourn and bury Cave  in the elaborate style the dignity of an old Seven Dials inhabitant  demands, they had appealed to a friendly fellow-tradesman in Great  Portland Street. He had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at  a valuation. The valuation was his own and the crystal egg was included  in one of the lots. Mr. Wace, after a few suitable consolatory  observations, a little off-handedly proffered perhaps, hurried at once  to Great Portland Street. But there he learned that the crystal egg had  already been sold to a tall, dark man in grey. And there the material  facts in this curious, and to me at least very suggestive, story come  abruptly to an end. The Great Portland Street dealer did not know who  the tall dark man in grey was, nor had he observed him with sufficient  attention to describe him minutely. He did not even know which way this  person had gone after leaving the shop. For a time Mr. Wace remained in  the shop, trying the dealer's patience with hopeless questions, venting  his own exasperation. And at last, realising abruptly that the whole  thing had passed out of his hands, had vanished like a vision of the  night, he returned to his own rooms, a little astonished to find the  notes he had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table.    His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great. He made a  second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland Street dealer,  and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were likely to  come into the hands of a _bric-a-brac_ collector. He also wrote letters  to _The Daily Chronicle_ and _Nature_, but both those periodicals,  suspecting a hoax, asked him to reconsider his action before they  printed, and he was advised that such a strange story, unfortunately so  bare of supporting evidence, might imperil his reputation as an  investigator. Moreover, the calls of his proper work were urgent. So  that after a month or so, save for an occasional reminder to certain  dealers, he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg,  and from that day to this it remains undiscovered. Occasionally,  however, he tells me, and I can quite believe him, he has bursts of  zeal, in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the  search.    Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and  origin of it, are things equally speculative at the present time. If  the present purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the  enquiries of Mr. Wace to have reached him through the dealers. He has  been able to discover Mr. Cave's clergyman and \"Oriental\"--no other than  the Rev. James Parker and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in Java. I am  obliged to them for certain particulars. The object of the Prince was  simply curiosity--and extravagance. He was so eager to buy, because Cave  was so oddly reluctant to sell. It is just as possible that the buyer in  the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at  all, and the crystal egg, for all I know, may at the present moment be  within a mile of me, decorating a drawing-room "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#4)"],[1,"consideration of this important  subject we shall devote the first chapter of our book.

The earliest rudiments of the Astronomical Observatory are as little  known as the earliest discoveries in astronomy itself. Probably the  first application of instrumental observation to the heavenly bodies  consisted in the simple operation of measuring the shadow of a post cast  by the sun at noonday. The variations in the length of this shadow  enabled the primitive astronomers to investigate the apparent movements  of the sun. But even in very early times special astronomical  instruments were employed which possessed sufficient accuracy to add to  the amount of astronomical knowledge, and displayed considerable  ingenuity on the part of the designers.    Professor Newcomb[2] thus writes: \"The leader was Tycho Brahe, who was  born in 1546, three years after the death of Copernicus. His attention  was first directed to the study of astronomy by an eclipse of the sun on  August 21st, 1560, which was total in some parts of Europe. Astonished  that such a phenomenon could be predicted, he devoted himself to a study  of the methods of observation and calculation by which the prediction  was made. In 1576 the King of Denmark founded the celebrated observatory  of Uraniborg, at which Tycho spent twenty years assiduously engaged in  observations of the positions of the heavenly bodies with the best  instruments that could then be made. This was just before the invention  of the telescope, so that the astronomer could not avail himself of that  powerful instrument. Consequently, his observations were superseded by  the improved ones of the centuries following, and their celebrity and  importance are principally due to their having afforded Kepler the means  of discovering his celebrated laws of planetary motion.\"    The direction of the telescope to the skies by Galileo gave a wonderful  impulse to the study of the heavenly bodies. This extraordinary man is  prominent in the history of astronomy, not alone for his connection with  this supreme invention, but also for his achievements in the more  abstract parts of astronomy. He was born at Pisa in 1564, and in 1609  the first telescope used for astronomical observation was constructed.  Galileo died in 1642, the year in which Newton was born. It was Galileo  who laid with solidity the foundations of that science of Dynamics, of  which astronomy is the most splendid illustration; and it was he who, by  promulgating the doctrines taught by Copernicus, incurred the wrath of  the Inquisition.    The structure of the human eye in so far as the exquisite adaptation of  the pupil is concerned presents us with an apt illustration of the  principle of the telescope. To see an object, it is necessary that the  light from it should enter the eye. The portal through which the light  is admitted is the pupil. In daytime, when the light is brilliant, the  iris decreases the size of the pupil, and thus prevents too much light  from entering. At night, or whenever the light is scarce, the eye often  requires to grasp all it can. The pupil then expands; more and more  light is admitted according as the pupil grows larger. The illumination  of the image on the retina is thus effectively controlled in accordance  with the requirements of vision.    A star transmits to us its feeble rays of light, and from those rays  the image is formed. Even with the most widely-opened pupil, it may,  however, happen that the image is not bright enough to excite the  sensation of vision. Here the telescope comes to our aid: it catches all  the rays in a beam whose original dimensions were far too great to allow  of its admission through the pupil. The action of the lenses  concentrates those rays into a stream slender enough to pass through the  small opening. We thus have the brightness of the image on the retina  intensified. It is illuminated with nearly as much light as would be  collected from the same object through a pupil as large as the great  lenses of the telescope.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Principle of the Refracting Telescope.]    In astronomical observatories we employ telescopes of two entirely  different classes. The more familiar forms are those known as  _refractors_, in which the operation of condensing the rays of light is  conducted by refraction. The character of the refractor is shown in Fig.  1. The rays from the star fall upon the object-glass at the end of the  telescope, and on passing through they become refracted into a  converging beam, so that all intersect at the focus. Diverging from  thence, the rays encounter the eye-piece, which has the effect of  restoring them to parallelism. The large cylindrical beam which poured  down on the object-glass has been thus condensed into a small one, which  can enter the pupil. It should, however, be added that the composite  nature of light requires a more complex form of object-glass than the  simple lens here shown. In a refracting telescope we have to employ what  is known as the achromatic combination, consisting of one lens of flint  glass and one of crown glass, adjusted to suit each other with extreme  care.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--The Dome of the South Equatorial at Dunsink  Observatory Co Dublin.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Section of the Dome of Dunsink Observatory.]    The appearance of an astronomical observatory, designed to accommodate  an instrument of moderate dimensions, is shown in the adjoining figures.  The first (Fig. 2) represents the dome erected at Dunsink Observatory  for the equatorial telescope, the object-glass of which was presented to  the Board of Trinity College, Dublin, by the late Sir James South. The  main part of the building is a cylindrical wall, on the top of which  reposes a hemispherical roof. In this roof is a shutter, which can be  opened so as to allow the telescope in the interior to obtain a view of  the heavens. The dome is capable of revolving so that the opening may be  turned towards that part of the sky where the object happens to be  situated. The next view (Fig. 3) exhibits a section through the dome,  showing the machinery by which the attendant causes it to revolve, as  well as the telescope itself. The eye of the observer is placed at the  eye-piece, and he is represented in the act of turning a handle, which  has the power of slowly moving the telescope, in order to adjust the  instrument accurately on the celestial body which it is desired to  observe. The two lenses which together form the object-glass of this  instrument are twelve inches in diameter, and the quality of the  telescope mainly depends on the accuracy with which these lenses have  been wrought. The eye-piece is a comparatively simple matter. It  consists merely of one or two small lenses; and various eye-pieces can  be employed, according to the magnifying power which may be desired. It  is to be observed that for many purposes of astronomy high magnifying  powers are not desirable. There is a limit, too, beyond which the  magnification cannot be carried with advantage. The object-glass can  only collect a certain quantity of light from the star; and if the  magnifying power be too great, this limited amount of light will be  thinly dispersed over too large a surface, and the result will be found  unsatisfactory. The unsteadiness of the atmosphere still further limits  the extent to which the image may be advantageously magnified, for every  increase of power increases in the same degree the atmospheric  disturbance.    A telescope mounted in the manner here shown is called an _equatorial_.  The convenience of this peculiar style of supporting the instrument  consists in the ease with which the telescope can be moved so as to  follow a star in its apparent journey across the sky. The necessary  movements of the tube are given by clockwork driven by a weight, so  that, once the instrument has been correctly pointed, the star will  remain in the observer's field of view, and the effect of the apparent  diurnal movement will be neutralised. The last refinement in this  direction is the application of an electrical arrangement by which the  driving of the instrument is controlled from the standard clock of the  observatory.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--The Telescope at Yerkes Observatory, Chicago.    (_From the Astrophysical Journal, Vol. vi., No. 1._)]    The power of a refracting telescope--so far as the expression has any  definite meaning--is to be measured by the diameter of its object-glass.  There has, indeed, been some honourable rivalry between the various  civilised nations as to which should possess the greatest refracting  telescope. Among the notable instruments that have been successfully  completed is that erected in 1881 by Sir Howard Grubb, of Dublin, at the  splendid observatory at Vienna. Its dimensions may be estimated from the  fact that the object-glass is two feet and three inches in diameter.
