Prior to the election at which these gentlemen were chosen, Mr. Lincoln  addressed a characteristic note to Gov. Shepley, which was in effect  a warning that Federal officials not citizens of Louisiana must not  be chosen to represent the State in Congress, \"We do not,\" said he,  referring to the South, \"particularly need members of Congress from  those States to get along with legislation here. What we do want is the  conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing  to be members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution, and  that other respectable citizens are willing to vote for them and send  them. To send a parcel of Northern men as Representatives, elected,  as would be understood, (and perhaps really so) at the point of the  bayonet, would be disgraceful and outrageous.\"    Mr. Lincoln would tolerate none of the \"carpet-bagging\" that afterwards  became so conspicuous and offensive under the Congressional plan of  Reconstruction.    These steps for reconstruction in Louisiana were followed by the  assembling of a convention to frame a new constitution for that State.  The convention was organized early in 1864, and its most important act  was the prompt incorporation of an antislavery clause in its organic  law. By a vote of 70 to 16 the convention declared slavery to be forever  abolished in the State. The new Constitution was adopted by the people  of the State on the 5th day of the ensuing September by a vote of 6,836  in its favor, to 1,566 against it. As the total vote of Louisiana in  1860 was 50,510, the new government had fulfilled the requirement of  the President's Proclamation. It was sustained by more than the required  one-tenth vote.    In a personal note of congratulation to Gov. Hahn, of Louisiana, the  President, speaking of the coming convention, suggested that \"some of  the colored people be let in, as for instance, the very intelligent, and  especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks.\" \"They would,\"  said he, \"probably help in some trying time in the future TO KEEP THE  JEWEL OF LIBERTY IN THE FAMILY OF FREEDOM.\"    This action in regard to Louisiana was accompanied, indeed in some  particulars preceded, by similar action in Arkansas. A Governor was  elected, an anti-slavery Constitution adopted, a State Government duly  installed, and Senators and Representatives in Congress elected, but  were refused admission by Congress. Mr. Sumner, when the credentials  of the Senators-elect were presented, foreshadowing the position to be  taken by the Republican leaders, offered a resolution declaring that  \"a State pretending to secede from the Union, and battling against the  General Government to maintain that position, must be regarded as a  rebel State subject to military occupation and without representation  on this floor until it has been readmitted by a vote of both Houses of  Congress; and the Senate will decline to receive any such application  from any such rebel State until after such a vote by both Houses.\"    A few weeks later, on the 27th of June, 1864, this resolution was in  effect reported back to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee, to which  it had been referred, and adopted by a vote of 27 to 6. The same action  was had in the House of Representatives on the application of the  Representatives-elect from Arkansas for admission to that body.    This was practically the declaration of a rupture between the President  and Congress on the question of Reconstruction. It was a rebuke to Mr.  Lincoln for having presumed to treat the seceded States as still in any  sense States of the Union. It was in effect a declaration that those  States had successfully seceded--that their elimination from the  Union was an accomplished fact--that the Union of the States had been  broken--and that the only method left for their return that would be  considered by Congress was as conquered and outlying provinces, not even  as Territories with the right of such to membership in the Union; and  should be governed accordingly until such time as Congress should see  fit (IF EVER, to use the language of Mr. Stevens in the House) to  devise and establish some form whereby they could be annexed to or  re-incorporated into the Union.    It was at this point--on the great question of Reconstruction, or more  properly of Restoration--that the disagreements originated between the  Executive and Congress which finally culminated in the impeachment of  Mr. Lincoln's successor; and that condition of strained relations was  measurably intensified when, on the following July 4th, a bill was  passed by Congress making provision for the reorganization and admission  of the revolted States on the extreme lines indicated by the above  action of Congress and containing the very extraordinary provision that  the President, AFTER OBTAINING THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS, shall recognize  the State Government so established. That measure was still another and  more marked rebuke by Congress to the President for having presumed to  initiate a system of restoration without its consultation and advice.  Naturally Mr. Lincoln was not in a mood to meekly accept the rebuke  so marked and manifestly intended; and so the bill not having passed  Congress till within the ten days preceding its adjournment allowed  by the Constitution for its consideration by the President, and as  it proposed to undo the work he had done, he failed to return it to  Congress--\"pocketed\" it--and it therefore fell. He was not in a mood to  accept a Congressional rebuke. He had given careful study to the duties,  the responsibilities, and the limitations of the respective Departments  of, the Government, and was not willing that his judgment should be  revised, or his course censured, however indirectly, by any of its  co-ordinate branches.    Four days after the session had closed, he issued a Proclamation in  which he treated the bill merely as the expression of an opinion  by Congress as to the best plan of Reconstruction--\"which plan,\" he  remarked, \"it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their  consideration.\"    He further stated in this Proclamation that he had already presented one  plan of restoration, and that he was \"unprepared by a formal approval of  this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration,  and was unprepared to declare that the free State Constitutions and  Governments already adopted and installed in Louisiana and Arkansas,  shall be set aside and held for naught, thereby repelling and  discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to further  effort, and unprepared to declare a constitutional competency in  Congress to abolish slavery in the States, though sincerely hoping that  a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery in all the States might be  adopted.\"    While, with these objections, Mr. Lincoln could not approve the bill, he  concluded his Proclamation with these words:    \"Nevertheless, I am fully satisfied with the plan of restoration  contained in the bill as one very proper for the loyal people of any  State choosing to adopt it, and I am and at all times shall be prepared  to give Executive aid and assistance to any such people as soon as  military resistance to the United States shall have been suppressed in  any such State and the people thereof shall have sufficiently returned  to their obedience to the Constitution and laws of the United States--in  which Military Governors will be appointed with directions to proceed  according to the bill.\"    \"It must be frankly admitted,\" says Mr. Blaine in reciting this record  in his 'Thirty Years of Congress,' \"that Mr. Lincoln's course was in some  of its respects extraordinary. It met with almost unanimous dissent on  the part of the Republican members, and violent criticism from the more  radical members of both Houses. * * * Fortunately, the Senators and  Representatives had returned to their States and Districts before the  Reconstruction Proclamation was issued, and found the people united and  enthusiastic in Mr. Lincoln's support.\"    In the last speech Mr. Lincoln ever made, (April 11th, 1865) referring  to the twelve thousand men who had organized the Louisiana Government,  (on the one-tenth basis) he said:    \"If we now reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and  disperse them. We say to the white man, you are worthless, or worse.  We will neither help you or be helped by you. To the black man we say,  'this cup of liberty which these, your old masters hold to your lips,  we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the  spilled and scattered contents IN SOME VAGUE AND UNDEFINED WHEN AND  WHERE AND HOW.' If this course, discouraging and paralyzing to both  white and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper  practical relations with the Union, I have so far been unable to  perceive it. If, on the contrary, they reorganize and sustain the new  Government of Louisiana, the converse of all this is made true. We  encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand men to adhere  to their work and argue for it, and proselyte for it, and fight for it,  and grow it, and ripen it to a complete success. The colored man, too,  in seeing all united for him, is inspired with vigilance and with  energy and daring to the same end. Grant that he desires the elective  franchise. HE WILL YET ATTAIN IT SOONER BY SAVING THE ALREADY ADVANCED  STEPS TOWARD IT THAN BY RUNNING BACK OVER THEM. Concede that the new  Government of Louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg to the  fowl; we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing  it.\"    It is manifest that Mr. Lincoln intuitively foresaw the danger of a  great body of the people"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24420"],[0,"The Story of Frithiof the Bold (#4)"],[1,"that he would take the money.          CHAPTER VIII.     King Ring weddeth Ingibiorg.    Now shall it be told of what came to pass in Norway the while Frithiof  was away: for those brethren let burn up all the stead at Foreness.  Moreover, while the weird sisters were at their spells they tumbled down  from off their high witch-mount, and brake both their backs.    That autumn came King Ring north to Sogn to his wedding, and there at a  noble feast drank his bridal with Ingibiorg.    \"Whence came that goodly ring which thou hast on thine arm?\" said King  Ring to Ingibiorg.    She said her father had owned it, but he answered and said:    \"Nay, for Frithiof s gift it is: so take it off thine arm straightway;  for no gold shalt thou lack whenas thou comest to Elfhome.\"    So she gave the ring to King Helgi's wife, and bade her give it to  Frithiof when he came back.    Then King Ring wended home with his wife, and loved her with exceeding  great love.          CHAPTER IX.     Frithiof brings the Tribute to the Kings.    The spring after these things Frithiof departed from the Orkneys and  Earl Angantyr in all good liking; and Hallward went with Frithiof.    But when they came to Norway they heard tell of the burning of  Frithiof's stead.    So when he was gotten to Foreness, Frithiof said: \"Black is my house  waxen now; no friends have been at work here.\" And he sang withal:              \"Frank and free,            With my father dead,            In Foreness old            We drank aforetime.            Now my abode            Behold I burned;            For many ill deeds            The kings must I pay.\"    Then he sought rede of his men what was to be done; but they bade him  look to it: then he said that the scat must first be paid out of hand.  So they rowed over the Firth to Sowstrand; and there they heard that the  kings were gone to Baldur's Meads to sacrifice to the gods; so Frithiof  and Biorn went up thither, and bade Hallward and Asmund break up  meanwhile all ships, both great and small, that were anigh; and they did  so. Then went Frithiof and his fellow to the door at Baldur's Meads, and  Frithiof would go in. Biorn bade him fare warily, since he must needs go  in alone; but Frithiof charged him to abide without, and keep watch; and  he sang a stave:              \"All alone go I            Unto the stead;            No folk I need            For the finding of kings;            But cast ye the fire            O'er the kings' dwellingly            If I come not again            In the cool of the even.\"    \"Ah,\" said Biorn, \"a goodly singing!\"    Then went Frithiof in, and saw but few folk in the Hall of the  Goddesses; there were the kings at their blood-offering, sitting  a-drinking; a fire was there on the floor, and the wives of the kings  sat thereby, a-warming the gods, while others anointed them, and wiped  them with napkins.    So Frithiof went up to King Helgi and said: \"Have here thy scat!\"    And therewith he heaved up the purse wherein was the silver, and drave  it on to the face of the king; whereby were two of his teeth knocked  out, and he fell down stunned in his high seat; but Halfdan got hold of  him, so that he fell not into the fire. Then sang Frithiof:              \"Have here thy scat,            High lord of the warriors!            Heed that and thy teeth,            Lest all tumble about thee!            Lo the silver abideth            At the bight of this bag here,            That Biorn and I            Betwixt us have borne thee.\"    Now there were but few folk in the chamber, because the drinking was  in another place; so Frithiof went out straightway along the floor, and  beheld therewith that goodly ring of his on the arm of Helgi's wife as  she warmed Baldur at the fire; so he took hold of the ring, but it was  fast to her arm, and he dragged her by it over the pavement toward the  door, and Baldur fell from her into the fire; then Halfdan's wife caught  hastily at Baldur, whereby the god that she was warming fell likewise  into the fire, and the fire caught both the gods, for they had been  anointed, and ran up thence into the roof, so that the house was all  ablaze: but Frithiof got the ring to him ere he came out. So then Biorn  asked him what had come of his going in there; but Frithiof held up the  ring and sang a stave:              \"The heavy purse smote Helgi            Hard 'midst his scoundrel's visage:            Lowly bowed Halfdan's brother,            Fell bundling 'mid the high seat;            There Baldur fell a-burning.            But first my bright ring gat I.            Fast from the roaring fire            I dragged the bent crone forward.\"    Men say that Frithiof cast a firebrand up on to the roof, so that the  hall was all ablaze, and therewith sang a stave:              \"Down stride we toward the sea-strand,            And strong deeds set a-going,            For now the blue flame bickers            Amidst of Baldur's Meadow.\"    And therewith they went down to the sea.          CHAPTER X.     Frithiof made an Outlaw.    But as soon as King Helgi had come to himself he bade follow after  Frithiof speedily, and slay them all, him and his fellows: \"A man of  forfeit life, who spareth no Place of Peace!\"    So they blew the gathering for the kings' men, and when they came out to  the hall they saw that it was afire; so King Halfdan went thereto with  some of the folk, but King Helgi followed after Frithiof and his men,  who were by then gotten a-shipboard and were lying on their oars.    Now King Helgi and his men find that all the ships are scuttled, and  they have to turn back to shore, and have lost some men: then waxed King  Helgi so wroth that he grew mad, and he bent his bow, and laid an arrow  on the string, and drew at Frithiof so mightily that the bow brake  asunder in the midst.    But when Frithiof saw that, then he gat him to the two bow oars of  Ellidi, and laid so hard on them that they both brake, and with that he  sang a stave:              \"Young Ingibiorg            Kissed I aforetime,            Kissed Beli's daughter            In Baldur's Meadow.            So shall the oars            Of Ellidi            Break both together            As Helgi's bow breaks.\"    Then the land-wind ran down the firth and they hoisted sail and sailed;  but Frithiof bade them look to it that they might have no long abiding  there. And so withal they sailed out of the Sognfirth, and Frithiof  sang:              \"Sail we away from Sogn,            E'en as we sailed aforetime,            When flared the fire all over            The house that was my fathers'.            Now is the bale a-burning            Amidst of Baldur's Meadow:            But wend I as a wild-wolf,            Well wot I they have sworn it.\"    \"What shall we turn to now, foster-brother?\" said Biorn.    \"I may not abide here in Norway,\" said Frithiof: \"I will learn the ways  of warriors, and sail a-warring.\"    So they searched the isles and out-skerries the summer long, and  gathered thereby riches and renown; but in autumn-tide they made for  the Orkneys, and Angantyr gave them good welcome, and they abode there  through the winter-tide.    But when Frithiof was gone from Norway the kings held a Thing, whereat  was Frithiof made an outlaw throughout their realm: they took his lands  to them, moreover, and King Halfdan took up his abode at Foreness, and  built up again all Baldur's Meadow, though it was long ere the fire  was slaked there. This misliked King Helgi most, that the gods were all  burned up, and great was the cost or ever Baldur's Meadow was built anew  fully equal to its first estate.    So King Helgi abode still at Sowstrand.          CHAPTER XI.     Frithiof fareth to see King Ring and Ingibiorg.    Frithiof waxed ever in riches and renown whithersoever he went: evil men  he slew, and grimly strong-thieves, but husbandmen and chapmen he let  abide in peace; and now was he called anew Frithiof the Bold; he had  gotten to him by now a great company well arrayed, and was become  exceeding wealthy of chattels.    But when Frithiof had been three winters a-warring he sailed west, and  made the Wick; then he said that he would go a-land: \"But ye shall fare  a-warring without me this winter; for I begin to weary of warfare, and  would fain go to the Uplands, and get speech of King Ring: but hither  shall ye come to meet me in the summer, and I will be here the first day  of summer.\"    Biorn said: \"This counsel is naught wise, though thou must needs rule;  rather would I that we fare north to Sogn, and slay both those kings,  Helgi and Halfdan.\"    \"It is all naught,\" said Frithiof; \"I must needs go see King Ring and  Ingibiorg.\"    Says Biorn: \"Loth am I hereto that thou shouldst risk thyself alone in  his hands; for this Ring is a wise man and of great kin, though he be  somewhat old.\"    But Frithiof said he would have his own way: \"And thou, Biorn, shalt be  captain of our company meanwhile.\"    So they did as he bade, and Frithiof fared to the Uplands in the autumn,  for he desired sore to look upon the love of King Ring and Ingibiorg.  But or ever he came there he did on him, over his clothes, a great cloak  all shaggy; two staves he had in his hand, and a mask over his face, and  he made as if he were exceeding old.    So he met certain herdsmen, and, going heavily, he asked them: \"Whence  are ye?\" They answered and said: \"We are of Streitaland, whereas the  king dwelleth.\"    Quoth the carle: \"Is King Ring a mighty king, then?\"    They answered: \"Thou lookest to us old enough to have cunning to know  what manner of man is King Ring in all wise.\"    The carle said that he had heeded salt-boiling more than the ways of  kings; and therewith he goes up to the king's house.    So when the day was well worn he came into the hall, blinking about as a  dotard, and took an outward place, pulling his hood over him to hide his  visage.    Then spake King Ring to"]]]
