It is of great importance that  the various persons under whose care these dogs were trained  should--though independently of each other--have made similar  observations. All investigators have reported the same astonishing  memory, this affording the foundation for the dogs' feats in reckoning  and spelling.          [6] Taken from the \"Communications of The Society for Animal        Psychology,\" 1916. pp. 6-9.    \"As these reports come from persons resident at different places, who  neither know, nor are in communication with each other, we here have  the surest proof there is no secret or trick involved in the matter.\"      \"A. REPORT ON THE BITCH ILSE    \"Concerning Ilse, of whom a clergyman is the owner, Dr. Oelhausen has  already given us some details in earlier numbers of our  'Communications'.[7] He now sends me the following, which he received  from Frau Dr. Moekel in the summer of last year. The reverend gentleman  had left Ilse for a few hours at Frau Dr. Moekel's--as he had often  done before--while he went into town to make some purchases. On this  particular occasion Frau Dr. Moekel noticed that Ilse looked  particularly depressed, and her little daughter, Carla, being disturbed  about the dog's woe-begone air, said: 'Mummy, Ilse must be in trouble!  Only see how serious she is!' So Frau Dr. Moekel asked the dog: 'Ilse,  are you really sorrowful?' To which Ilse responded: 'Ja, hr hib.' ( =  yes, Master beating!). Frau Dr. Moekel: 'But Ilse, I am sure your  master is kind to you; you are imagining!'          [7] These dogs were born on 26 and 27 January, 1914. Compare the        letter of Rolf in the \"Communications of the Society for Animal        Psychology,\" 1914, p. 28; and \"The Soul of the Animal,\" p. 111.    \"Ilse: 'bd'.    \"Frau Dr. Moekel: 'Bed? Ilse--have you a bed?'    \"Ilse: 'Nein.'    \"Frau Dr. Moekel: 'But where do you sleep?'    \"Ilse: 'hols.'    \"Frau Dr. Moekel: 'Ilse, you poor little dog! Have you to sleep on the  wood behind the stove?'    \"Ilse: 'Ja!'    \"Frau Dr. Moekel: 'Then I'll tell you what to do, Ilse: you just get up  on to your master's bed--he needn't have it all to himself.'    \"Frau Dr. Moekel said later that she had not made this suggestion  seriously, that, in fact, she had said it more to quiet Carla, and had  soon forgotten all about it. But the next day the dog's master called  again and complained of Ilse, saying: 'What do you think of this? Ilse  is really getting unbearable--the beast got into my bed last night:  there she was this morning--stretched her whole length!' And Frau Dr.  Moekel had now to confess that she herself had instigated this lapse on  Ilse's part.    \"To this account Dr. Oelhausen has added: 'This statement has several  points of interest. There is firstly the complaint about 'beatings,'  and secondly the comparison drawn between her own nocturnal quarters  and those of Rolf. It may also be noticed that she was very sparing of  her words, using, indeed, no more than the merest 'essentials'! Then,  observe the careful way in which she followed 'Mother's' advice--only  getting into her master's bed after he was well asleep!'    \"Another incident, the details of which were supplied to him by Ilse's  master, has also been communicated to us by Dr. Oelhausen:    \"'The clergyman had taken several of his village school-children for a  walk, during the course of which he asked them the names of the various  trees. Among these was one of which no child could tell the name. Ilse,  his constant companion, was also of the party, and she now pressed  forward with such marked interest that her master put the question to  her too. At this Ilse started rapping and spelt out the correct  name--the tree was a larch. Her master was greatly surprised at this,  suggested, however, that it was probably less a matter of knowledge  than of thought-transference, yet Dr. Oelhausen queries whether the dog  might not have heard the name mentioned on some previous outing, and  her master admits that this might have been the case.'    \"We know the unfaltering tenacity with which the Mannheim dog, Rolf,  remembers names, so that it would seem more reasonable to ascribe the  spelling of the name to her excellent memory than to thought-transference,  which would be quite as inexplicable and incomprehensible.    \"To the above I may add one more incident touching Ilse, which I  received from Frau Dr. Moekel on 25 May, 1915:    \"'Ilse will prove valuable to us, for--though I have given her no  instruction--her master has achieved the very same results with her as  I have with Rolf.[8] This is what took place the other day: My dear  husband went to see our reverend friend and having arrived too early  for Divine Service, seated himself on a high stone in the neighbourhood  of the little church and not far from the parsonage. Our friend saw my  husband and came out, accompanied by Ilse, to fetch him into the house.  Ilse jumped up against my husband, wagged her tail, licked him--and  showed so much exuberant affection that her master was quite surprised,  and asked her:          [8] Ilse was barely two months old when she came into the        possession of her master, on 20 April, 1914.    \"'Do you know this gentleman?' To which Ilse replied: 'No!' adding, as  though as an after-thought--'Rolf!' She had evidently scented Rolf (who  is her father and of whom she is very fond) about my husband's  clothes'\"      \"B. REPORT ON THE DOG HEINZ    \"A second dog, by name Heinz, who came into the possession of Mr.  Justice Leser in Mannheim, has proved himself to be an excellent  arithmetician, and this without ever having been worried with  instruction. In the same way as Rolf he gives two raps for 'yes' and  three for 'no,' while four express that he is 'tired.'    \"Mr. Justice Leser reports:    \"If I ask Heinz whether he will do arithmetic he invariably raps \"2,\"  even though sometimes accompanying his assent with a yawn. I am  generally obliged to hold out the prospect of some reward as an  inducement to do his sums. I should have preferred his rapping against  some article one could hold in one's hand, or that he could be induced  to \"rap out\" on a board setting forth the numbers, and which might be  placed on the floor before him; but to neither of these alternatives  will he agree, having since his earliest youth learnt to rap in the  same way as Rolf does. He will, however, not only rap for me, but for  any person he knows well, solving such problems as: 3 + 4 - 6, or  [121rt] + 3, or 14/2 + 4, or 3^2, and he seldom makes a mistake, even  when the sum he may be asked merely resembles the form of arithmetic he  has learnt. But he generally gives up after two or three sums and is  generally distracted. He can read the figures too, and generally gives  a correct solution to sums which have been written down for him and  which I myself have not read. Like Rolf, he only looks at the paper  sideways. He reads very reluctantly. His memory is excellent;  especially quick is he at recognizing those persons again who have at  any time had to do with him.'    \"When I was in Mannheim on 22 March, 1916, Mr. Justice Leser was kind  enough to show me the dog. I put some problems to it verbally and was  able to satisfy myself as to its abilities in the matter of arithmetic.  Of those then put by me I still call to mind the following: '24 / 3 -  3?' Answer: '5,' and '[10,000rt] - 87?' Answer: '13.'[9]          [9] The dog had become familiar with square roots in the course        of earlier attempts.\"      \"C. REPORT ON THE DOG HARRAS    \"The third dog, Harras, came into the possession of Fraeulein Eva  Hoffmann, of Schloss Berwartstein, near Bergzabern, and was instructed  by her in spelling and arithmetic with excellent results. This lady  sends the following report:    \"'From the very beginning his gift for arithmetic was quite remarkable.  It was enough to give him an idea of how to reckon, explaining to him  the different forms of arithmetic, for the dog to learn to give the  right answers to easy sums immediately.    \"'Fractions, decimals, cubes and the easier forms of equation, have  been set him by a stranger. With some coaching he was also able to  master textual problems in this way, giving eager and glad response in  the form of \"yes\" and \"no\" when it came to questioning him as to his  having understood or not understood--liked or not liked the subject. He  usually did his sums with evident pleasure and with amazing celerity.  Spelling gave him more trouble. He could not even remember an alphabet  he had himself put together, and one I invented for him he only  memorized after going over it many times. He took no pleasure in  putting words together and got tired very soon. Some of his original  remarks are that he recognized Sunday by the \"dress\" I had on; also  that he had dreamt of a \"cow\" (this after having seen one when we were  out walking), and so on.    \"'Remarkable is his love of truth; should he have done anything that  deserves punishment, he approaches me with his head hanging down and a  very dejected tail--replying to the question as to whether he deserves  a whipping with a reluctant \"yes,\" and to a further enquiry as to  whether he is ashamed of himself, he responds with an emphatic  \"yes--yes--yes!\"    \"'But as is the case with children, example and precept are of far  greater use than corporeal punishment, although this cannot be  neglected altogether. The axiom that we evolve in accordance with the  treatment meted out to us is as true in the case of an animal as it is  with that of a human being, and the more this is recognized and laid to  heart the shorter will be the martyrdom still inflicted upon the animal  kingdom.'    \"In the March of this year Fraeulein Hoffmann was kind enough to  communicate the following incident to me; it corroborates an earlier  observation made by Frau Dr. Moekel (compare 'Communications of the  Society for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25918"],[0,"Heads and Tales : or, Anecdotes and Stories of Quadrupeds and Other Beasts, (#4)"],[1,"his delight by saying how gratifying it was to see skulls of  great men at different ages, for he had just seen at Bath the skull of  the Protector when a youth!      SIR DAVID WILKIE AND THE BABY.    A very popular novelist and author of the present day tells the  following anecdote of the simplicity of Sir David Wilkie, with regard to  his knowledge of _infant_ human nature:--    On the birth of his first son, at the beginning of 1824, William  Collins,[3] the great artist, requested Sir David Wilkie to become one  of the sponsors for his child.[4] The painter's first criticism on his  future godson is worth recording from its simplicity. Sir David, whose  studies of human nature extended to everything but _infant_ human  nature, had evidently been refreshing his faculties for the occasion, by  taxing his boyish recollections of puppies and kittens; for, after  looking intently into the child's eyes as it was held up for his  inspection, he exclaimed to the father, with serious astonishment and  satisfaction, \"He _sees_!\"      MAN DEFINED SOMEWHAT IN THE LINNAEAN MANNER.    One who is partial to the Linnaean mode of characterising objects of  natural history has amused himself with drawing up the following  definition of man:--\"_Simia sine cauda; pedibus posticis ambulans;  gregarius, omnivorus, inquietus, mendax, furax, rapax, salax, pugnax,  artium variarum capax, animalium reliquorum hostis, sui ipsius inimicus  acerrimus._\"    Montgomery translated the description thus:--       \"Man is an animal unfledged,     A monkey with his tail abridged;     A thing that walks on spindle legs,     With bones as brittle, sir, as eggs;     His body, flexible and limber,     And headed with a knob of timber;     A being frantic and unquiet,     And very fond of beef and riot;     Rapacious, lustful, rough, and martial,     To lies and lying scoundrels partial!     By nature form'd with splendid parts     To rise in science--shine in arts;     Yet so confounded cross and vicious,     A mortal foe to all his species!     His own best _friend_, and you must know,     His own worst _enemy_ by being so!\"[5]      ADDISON AND STEELE ON SOME OF THE PECULIARITIES OF THE NATURAL HISTORY  COLLECTORS OF THE DAY.    In one of the early volumes of _Chambers's Edinburgh Journal_, there was  a very curious paper entitled \"Nat Phin.\" Although considerably  exaggerated, no one who had the happiness of knowing the learned,  amiable, and excellent Dr Patrick Neill, could fail to recognise, in the  transposed title, an amusing description of his love of natural history  pets, zoological and botanical. The fun of the paper is that \"Nat\" gets  married, and, coming home one day from his office, finds that his young  wife has caused the gardener to clear out his ponds of tadpoles and  zoophytes.    Addison or Sir Richard Steele, or both of them, in the following paper  of the _Tatler_ (No. 221, Sept. 7, 1710), has given one of those quietly  satiric pictures of many a well-known man of the day, some Petiver or  Hans Sloane. The widow Gimcrack's letter is peculiarly racy. Although  old books, the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ still furnish rare material to  many a popular magazine writer of the day, who sometimes does little  more than dilute a paper in these and other rare repertories of the  style and wit of a golden age. We meditated offering various extracts  from Swift and Daniel Defoe; but our space limits us to one, and the  following may for the present suffice.       \"_From my own Apartment, September 6._    \"As I was this morning going out of my house, a little boy in a black  coat delivered me the following letter. Upon asking who he was, he told  me that he belonged to my Lady Gimcrack. I did not at first recollect  the name, but, upon inquiry, I found it to be the widow of Sir Nicholas,  whose legacy I lately gave some account of to the world. The letter ran  thus:--    \"'MR BICKERSTAFF,--I hope you will not be surprised to receive a letter  from the widow Gimcrack. You know, sir, that I have lately lost a very  whimsical husband, who, I find, by one of your last week's papers, was  not altogether a stranger to you. When I married this gentleman, he had  a very handsome estate; but, upon buying a set of microscopes, he was  chosen a _Fellow of the Royal Society; from which time I do not remember  ever to have heard him speak as other people did_, or talk in a manner  that any of his family could understand him. He used, however, to pass  away his time very innocently in conversation with several members of  that learned body: for which reason I never advised him against their  company for several years, until at last I found his brain quite turned  with their discourses. The first symptoms which he discovered of his  being a _virtuoso_, as you call him, poor man! was about fifteen years  ago; when he gave me positive orders to turn off an old weeding woman,  that had been employed in the family for some years. He told me, at the  same time, that there was no such thing in nature as a weed, and that it  was his design to let his garden produce what it pleased; so that, you  may be sure, it makes a very pleasant show as it now lies. About the  same time he took a humour to ramble up and down the country, and would  often bring home with him his pockets full of moss and pebbles. This,  you may be sure, gave me a heavy heart; though, at the same time, I must  needs say, he had the character of a very honest man, notwithstanding  he was reckoned a little weak, until he began to sell his estate, and  buy those strange baubles that you have taken notice of. Upon  midsummerday last, as he was walking with me in the fields, he saw a  very odd-coloured butterfly just before us. I observed that he  immediately changed colour, like a man that is surprised with a piece of  good luck; and telling me that it was what he had looked for above these  twelve years, he threw off his coat, and followed it. I lost sight of  them both in less than a quarter of an hour; but my husband continued  the chase over hedge and ditch until about sunset; at which time, as I  was afterwards told, he caught the butterfly as she rested herself upon  a cabbage, near five miles from the place where he first put her up. He  was here lifted from the ground by some passengers in a very fainting  condition, and brought home to me about midnight. His violent exercise  threw him into a fever, which grew upon him by degrees, and at last  carried him off. In one of the intervals of his distemper he called to  me, and, after having excused himself for running out his estate, he  told me that he had always been more industrious to improve his mind  than his fortune, and that his family must rather value themselves upon  his memory as he was a wise man than a rich one. He then told me that it  was a custom among the Romans for a man to give his slaves their liberty  when he lay upon his death-bed. I could not imagine what this meant,  until, after having a little composed himself, he ordered me to bring  him a flea which he had kept for several months in a chain, with a  design, as he said, to give it its manumission. This was done  accordingly. He then made the will, which I have since seen printed in  your works word for word. Only I must take notice that you have omitted  the codicil, in which he left a large _concha veneris_, as it is there  called, to a _Member of the Royal Society_, who was often with him in  his sickness, and _assisted him in his will_. And now, sir, I come to  the chief business of my letter, which is to desire your friendship and  assistance in the disposal of those many rarities and curiosities which  lie upon my hands. If you know any one that has an occasion for a parcel  of dried spiders, I will sell them a pennyworth. I could likewise let  any one have a bargain of cockle-shells. I would also desire your advice  whether I had best sell my beetles in a lump or by retail. The gentleman  above mentioned, who was my husband's friend, would have me make an  auction of all his goods, and is now drawing up a catalogue of every  particular for that purpose, with the two following words in great  letters over the head of them, Auctio Gimcrackiana. But, upon talking  with him, I begin to suspect he is as mad as poor Sir Nicholas was. Your  advice in all these particulars will be a great piece of charity to,  Sir, your most humble servant,       \"'ELIZABETH GIMCRACK.'    \"I shall answer the foregoing letter, and give the widow my best advice,  as soon as I can find out chapmen for the wares which she has to put  off.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [2] Life of Thomas Gainsborough, R.A.

MONKEYS.    THE GORILLA AND ITS STORY.      In the British Museum, in handsome glass cases, and on the floors of the  three first rooms at the top of the stairs, may be seen the largest  collection of the skins and skeletons of quadrupeds ever brought  together. In the third, or principal room, will be found a nearly  complete series of the QUADRUMANA or four-handed Mammalia. Monkeys are  _quadrumanous mammalia_. The resemblance of these animals to men is most  conspicuous, in the largest of them, such as the gorilla, orang-utan,  chimpanzee, and the long-armed or gibbous apes. Such resemblance is most  distant in the ferocious dog-faced baboons of Africa, the _Cynocephali_  of the ancients. It is softened off, but not effaced, in the pretty  little countenances of those dwarf pets from South America, the  ouistities or marmosets, and other species of new-world monkeys, some of  which are not larger than a squirrel.    They are well called MONKEYS,"]]]
