Paul said, \"Our gospel  came not unto you in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Spirit.\"  \"They went everywhere preaching the word; the Lord working with them and  confirming the word with signs following.\" The confirmation was not in  the simple fact that miracles were wrought, but in their character. The  miracles of Christ were not in the power of false prophets, magicians,  or demons. They were in the power of God. Peter said, \"God anointed  Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power,\" and that \"He  went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed of the devil;  for God was with him.\" The presence of God was manifested in his  miracles.    The question is often asked, \"Why were they not continued throughout the  Christian dispensation?\" Answer: If they had been continued, they would  have lost all their power over the mind by becoming ordinary, and then  they would cease to have any bearing whatever in the establishment of a  divine proposition. It was not necessary to continue them beyond the  witnesses whose testimony closed up the revelation of God. \"A covenant  once confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto.\" A continual  repetition of the evidence of confirmation was not necessary in order to  give faith in a communication already confirmed and left in a historic  age for the faith of the world. It is true of sense that the continual  sensuous experience causes the object experienced to lose its  controlling power, but the opposite is true of faith. So he who knew  best what man's nature required ordained that the just should walk by  faith and not by sense. And to this end he confirmed \"once\" the  revelation of himself and his will, and left it in the world as his  witness to produce faith. \"If we receive the witness of men the witness  of God is greater; for this is the witness of God which he hath  testified of his Son. He that believeth hath the witness in himself; he  that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not  the _record_ that God gave of his Son.\" Is it not a dangerous thing to  make God a liar? Is it not a great insult? All unbelievers are thus  guilty before God. Our Savior did not speak unadvisedly when he said:  \"He that believeth not shall be condemned.\"    \"Life and immortality are brought to light through the Gospel.\" Is it  not strange that dying men will reject the motive of life? \"This is the  record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his  Son; he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God  hath not life.\" Jesus \"came to his own and his own received him not, but  as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of  God.\" Will we possess him through faith and live, or shall we make God a  liar, die in our sins, be condemned and banished from the presence of  God and the glory of his power?           *       *       *       *       *    The practice of dating from the Christian era was first introduced about  the year 527, by Dionisius, surnamed \"Exiguus,\" but better known as  Deny's le Petit, a monk of Scythia and a Roman abbot. It was not  introduced into Italy until the sixth century. It was first used in  France in the seventh century; it was universally established in France  in the eighth century. It was used in England in 680; it was in general  use in the eighth century. The years of the Christian era are described  in ancient documents as the years \"of Grace,\" of \"the Incarnation,\" of  \"our Lord,\" of \"the Nativity,\" etc.--_Chambers._           *       *       *       *       *    The cardinal virtues are Justice, Prudence, Temperance and Fortitude.  _Cardinal_ signifies, in a general sense, principal or pre-eminent. It  comes from the Latin word _cardo_, a hinge. Take cardinal things away  from any science and its foundation is gone. Everything in science turns  upon cardinal things, as the word _cardo_ signifies.          A FUNERAL ORATION.    BY COL. G. DE VEVEU.           Of the future, the hereafter, we are as ignorant as we are of the       infinite conditions through which we have passed during the       eternity which has preceded our brief present existences. If we       could know the history of our past we might get a glimpse of our       future; but no message ever reached man from beyond the grave. The       past is a mere sealed book, the future is a blank. No records are       left to us save those written in the rocks and the evidences       brought before our senses; they tell their own stories. Whence came       we? Whither are we tending? Ah! who can tell? Some profess to know,       but they know not. Where have last summer's roses gone? What will       become of yon dry leaf, torn from its parent stem by this wintry       blast? Like us they disappear and are merged into the ocean of       matter from which they are evolved, ready to be re-combined into       new forms of beauty; for although individual existences perish,       matter is imperishable; having had no birth it will have no death.       Like time and space, it is infinite and eternal. Brought forth into       this world without being consulted, we are hurried out of it       without our consent. Like that leaf, which was the hope of spring,       the pride and glory of summer, we are rudely torn away, the sport       of destiny, to return to the elements of nature from which we       spring--dust to dust. The past is beyond recall; the future is       veiled in obscurity and in doubt; the present alone is ours.    The above is from the Boston _Investigator_. It has gone the rounds of  the press, and it is regarded as a very fine literary production. But  all is not gold that glitters. This oration was delivered as a tribute  of respect to the memory of Mrs. Boulay. It is a curiosity when viewed  from the speaker's standpoint. The man was evidently broken down in the  presence of death. I have sometimes thought it would be well for the  unbelievers to adopt the custom of delivering funeral sermons, for it is  certain, from all that is known of man, that no strong defense of  unbelief, nor even a respectable presentation of it, is made in the  presence of death. When an unbeliever speaks at his brother's grave of  the \"rustling of wings,\" I intuitively think of the old trite saying,  \"It is but one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.\" That step is  from the \"rustling of wings\" to \"infidelity.\" Col. G. Veveu, in the  above oration, sticks close to his unbelief, but smashes _his science_.  If our incredulous friends will continue to respect the dead enough to  remember them with an oration at their graves, I think it will be but a  short time till the people all over the country will see the hollow,  empty, good-for-nothing character of unbelief.    Mr. Veveu says, \"Although individual existences perish, matter is  imperishable; having had _no birth_ (_italics mine_) it will have _no  death_.\" A wonderful discovery! _Matter had no birth_; organisms are  born. They existed, however, prior to their birth. The matter that  composed them existed before it entered into organic forms. The living  element, spirit, or whatever you please to name it, took hold of the  elements of matter and built the organism. The life existed before the  organism. Why should it perish with it? Matter exists before birth and  after death. Spirit also exists before birth and after death. Why affirm  the eternity of matter and deny the eternity of spirit? These  unbelievers, being materialists, advocate the one substance theory. Yet  they talk about the \"unknown\" which they know, and know it to be the  \"invisible,\" the \"wonderful,\" the life, and the cause, at least, of all  intelligence and order. They are compelled to deify this. Does this pass  out of being with death? Does matter pass out of being with death? No,  nothing passes out of being except the organic form. The body returns to  the dust, _as it was_, and the spirit to God who gave it. Next, we have  this statement with reference to matter, \"Like time and space, it is  infinite and eternal.\" Why? The answer is, because it can not be  annihilated; death has simply destroyed an organization, changed the  condition of matter, the matter of the organism, and changed the  relations of the intelligent, living spirit; neither matter nor spirit  ceases to be. If matter is therefore infinite and eternal, spirit is  therefore infinite and eternal. The sooner scientists learn the fact  that birth simply brings us into certain relations, and death takes us  out of those relations, the better it will be for all who are concerned  in this interesting subject.    The next item in that eloquent effusion is that man is \"like the leaf,\"  the mere \"sport of destiny,\" returning in his \"autumn\" \"to the elements  of nature from which he sprang: dust to dust.\"    This orator asks the questions, \"Whence came we?\" \"Whither are we  tending?\" \"Who can tell?\" To them he gives two answers. First, he says,  \"Some profess to know, but they know not.\" \"The past is a mere sealed  book.\" \"The future is a blank.\" \"Of the future, the hereafter, we are as  ignorant as we are of the infinite conditions through which we have  passed during the eternity which has preceded our brief present  existences. If we could know the history of our past, we might get a  glimpse of our future,\" \"The past is a mere sealed book.\" Conclusion,  \"The future is a mere sealed book.\" The man is lost in the unbeliever's  \"narrow vale lying between two cold,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26323"],[0,"The Suffrage Cook Book (#4)"],[1," small onion            1 pint rich milk            2 tablespoons flour            1/2 cup water    Put spinach in double boiler with the butter and water. Let simmer  slowly until all the juice has been extracted from the spinach.    Fry the onion and add. Now thicken with the flour blended with the water  and strain. Add the milk very hot. Do not place on the fire after the  milk has been added.    Half cream instead of milk greatly improves flavor.      Crab Gumbo              3 doz. medium Okra            1 doz. Crabs cleaned            2 onions fried    Add the Crabs, then small can tomatoes. Thyme, parsley, bay leaf.      Tomato Soup              1 large can tomatoes or equivalent of fresh tomatoes.            1 small onion            1 tablespoon salt            dash paprika            2 1/2 tablespoons sugar            1 tablespoon butter            2 1/2 tablespoons flour            2 cups hot milk            1 pint water    Put tomatoes with 1 pt. water to boil, boil for at least half hour. Fry  onion in butter and add to soup with sugar and salt. When thoroughly  cooked thicken with the flour blended with a little water. Now strain.  Have the milk very hot, not boiling. Stir constantly while adding milk  to soup and serve at once.    Do not place on the stove after the milk is in the soup. 1 cup of cream  instead of 2 cups of milk greatly improves the soup.      Vegetable Soup              2 1/2 lbs. of beef (with soup bone)            3 quarts of water            1 tablespoon sugar            salt to suit taste            a few pepper corns            1 cup of each, of the following vegetables            diced small            carrots            Potatoes            Celery            2 tablespoons onion cut very fine            1/2 head cabbage cut very fine            1/2 can corn (or its equivalent in fresh)            1/2 can peas (or its equivalent fresh)            2 tablespoons minced parsley            1/4 cup turnip and parsnip if at hand (not necessary)            1/2 can tomatoes (or equivalent fresh)    Put meat in large kettle and boil for an hour; now add all the other  ingredients and cook until soft. Ready then to serve.    This soup can be made as a cream soup without meat and is delicious. In  this case you take a good sized piece of butter and fry all the  vegetables slightly, excepting the potatoes. Now cover all, adding  potatoes with boiling water and cook until tender.    When done season and add hot milk and 1 cup cream. This is very fine.    In making this soup without meat omit the tomatoes and use string beans  instead.                Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you            are.                            Brillat Savarin.      Chestnut Soup              1 qt. chestnuts (Spanish preferred)            1 pint chicken stock            2 tablespoons flour            1 teaspoon sugar            salt and paprika to taste    Cover chestnuts with boiling water slightly salted. Cook until quite  soft and rub through coarse sieve, add stock, and seasoning; then  thicken with flour blended with water.    Let simmer five minutes and serve at once.    In case stock is not available milk can be used with a little butter  added.      Peanut Butter Broth              1 pt. fresh sweet milk            1 pt. water            1 1/2 tablespoons peanut butter            1 tablespoon catsup            Salt, pepper or other season to taste.    Pour liquid with peanut butter into double boiler; dissolve butter so  there are no hard lumps. Do not let milk boil but place on moderately  hot fire.    Just before serving add the catsup and seasoning.      Soup for Invalids    Cut into small pieces one pound of beef or mutton or a part of both.  Boil it gently in two quarts of water. Take off the scum and when  reduced to a pint, strain it and season with a little salt. Give one  teacupful at a time.      Peanut Soup    Peanut soup for supper on a cold night serves the double duty of  stimulating the gastric juices to quicken action by its warmth and  furnishing protein to the body to repair its waste. Pound to a paste a  cupful of nuts from which the skin has been removed, add it to a pint of  milk and scald; melt a tablespoon of butter and mix it with a like  quantity of flour and add slowly to the milk and peanuts; cook until it  thickens and season to taste.    Chestnuts, too, make a splendid soup. Boil one quart of peeled and  blanched chestnuts in three pints of salt water until quite soft; pass  through sieve and add two tablespoons of sweet cream, and season to  taste. If too thick, add water.      Mock Oyster Soup    The oyster plant is used for this delicious dish--by many it is known as  salsify. Scrape the vegetable and cut into small pieces with a silver  knife (a steel knife would darken the oyster plant). Cook in just enough  water to keep from burning, and when tender press through a colander and  return to the water in which it was cooked. Add three cups of hot milk  which has been thickened with a little butter and flour and rubbed  together and seasoned with salt and white pepper. A little chopped  parsley may be added before serving. 1/2 cup cream instead of all milk  greatly improves taste.      French Oyster Soup              1 quart oysters            1 quart milk            1 slice onion            2 blades mace            1/3 cup flour            1/3 cup butter            2 egg yolks            salt and pepper    Clean oysters by pouring over 3/4 cup cold water. Drain, reserve liquor,  add oysters, slightly chopped, heat slowly to boiling point and let  simmer 20 minutes; strain.    Scald milk with onion and mace. Make white sauce and add oyster liquor.  Just before serving add egg yolks, slightly beaten.      Split Pea Soup (Green or Yellow)              1 1/2 pints split peas (green or yellow)            2 1/4 quarts water            2 small onions            1 carrot            1 parsnip (if at hand)            1 cup milk            1/2 cup cream            1 teaspoon salt (more if liked)            Pepper and paprika to taste            1 1/2 teaspoons sugar    Soak 1 1/2 pints of split peas over night; next day add 2 1/4 quarts  water and the vegetables, cut fine; also the sugar, salt and pepper and  cook slowly three hours; now mash through sieve. If it boils down too  much add a little water. After putting through sieve place on stove and  add hot milk and cream. If it is not thin enough to suit add more milk.    Stock may be used if same is available.      Black Bean Soup    One pint of black beans soaked over night in 3 quarts of water.    In the morning pour off the water and add fresh 3 quarts. Boil slowly 4  hours. When done there should be 1 quart. Add a quart of beef stock, 4  whole cloves, 4 whole allspice, 1 stalk of celery, 1 good-sized onion, 1  small carrot, 1 small turnip, all cut fine and fried in a little butter.    Add 1 tablespoon flour, season with salt and pepper and rub through a  fine sieve.    Serve with slices of lemon and egg balls.      Carrot Soup    One quart of thinly sliced carrots, one head of celery, three or four  quarts of water, boil for two and one-half hours; add one-half cupful of  rice and boil for an hour longer; season with salt and pepper and a  small cupful of cream.      Veal Soup              Knuckle of veal 2 1/2 pounds            2 raw eggs            3 quarts water            2 tomatoes cut fine            1/2 onion            salt and pepper to season            a little flour            1/2 cup vermicelli or alphabet macaroni            2 eggs, beaten very light            1 1/2 tablespoons parmesan cheese    Put veal in stewing pan and allow it to cook until thoroughly done. Now  chop meat and add cheese, flour, salt and pepper if needed and form into  little balls about the size of a marble. While preparing these, drop in  macaroni and cook until tender. Now add the meat balls.    If too thick use a little water. Beat the eggs lightly and add while  boiling.                    War Not Only Kills Bodies But Ideals                         MRS. HENRY VILLARD,                President of Women's Peace Conference.                Must the pride with which women point to the life            saving character of the work of the numberless            charitable agencies throughout the country--with a            resultant lowering of the death rate in our great            cities--be offset by the slaughter of our best            beloved ones on the field of battle or their death            by disease in camps?              No longer ought we to be called upon to be            particeps criminis with men to the extent of being            compelled to pay taxes which are largely used for            the support of the army and navy.              Moreover, a recourse to war as a means of righting            wrongs is full of peril to the whole human race.            Not only are bodies killed, but the ideals which            alone make life worth living are for the time            being lost to sight. In place of those finer            attributes of our nature--compassion, gentleness,            forgiveness--are substituted hatred, revenge and            cruelty.
