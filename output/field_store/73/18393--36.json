I don't say but that the  dog is a good dog. But he is of no use to us, and twenty dollars will  come in mighty handy just now. He's worth that to Bob, for he is a  good watch dog, so we've both made a fair bargain.\"    Nothing more was said about Ernest or Laddie. I had taken no part in  the discussion, for I felt no great interest in the matter. Laddie was  a nice dog; Ernest was a quiet, inoffensive little fellow, five years  younger than myself; that was all I thought about either of them.    I was spending my vacation at Uncle Richard's farm on the Nova Scotian  Bay of Fundy shore. I was a great favourite with Uncle Richard, partly  because he had been much attached to my mother, his only sister,  partly because of my strong resemblance to his only son, who had died  several years before. Uncle Richard was a stern, undemonstrative man,  but I knew that he entertained a deep and real affection for me, and I  always enjoyed my vacation sojourns at his place.    \"What are you going to do this afternoon, Ned?\" he asked, after the  disturbance caused by Ernest's outbreak had quieted down.    \"I think I'll row out to Island Rock,\" I replied. \"I want to take some  views of the shore from it.\"    Uncle Richard nodded. He was much interested in my new camera.    \"If you're on it about four o'clock, you'll get a fine view of the  'Hole in the Wall' when the sun begins to shine on the water through  it,\" he said. \"I've often thought it would make a handsome picture.\"    \"After I've finished taking the pictures, I think I'll go down shore  to Uncle Adam's and stay all night,\" I said. \"Jim's dark room is more  convenient than mine, and he has some pictures he is going to develop  tonight, too.\"    I started for the shore about two o'clock. Ernest was sitting on the  woodpile as I passed through the yard, with his arms about Laddie's  neck and his face buried in Laddie's curly hair. Laddie was a handsome  and intelligent black-and-white Newfoundland, with a magnificent coat.  He and Ernest were great chums. I felt sorry for the boy who was to  lose his pet.    \"Don't take it so hard, Ern,\" I said, trying to comfort him. \"Uncle  will likely get another pup.\"    \"I don't want any other pup!\" Ernest blurted out. \"Oh, Ned, won't you  try and coax your uncle not to sell him? Perhaps he'd listen to you.\"    I shook my head. I knew Uncle Richard too well to hope that.    \"Not in this case, Ern,\" I said. \"He would say it did not concern me,  and you know nothing moves him when he determines on a thing. You'll  have to reconcile yourself to losing Laddie, I'm afraid.\"    Ernest's tow-coloured head went down on Laddie's neck again, and I,  deciding that there was no use in saying anything more, proceeded  towards the shore, which was about a mile from Uncle Richard's house.  The beach along his farm and for several farms along shore was a  lonely, untenanted one, for the fisher-folk all lived two miles  further down, at Rowley's Cove. About three hundred yards from the  shore was the peculiar formation known as Island Rock. This was a  large rock that stood abruptly up out of the water. Below, about the  usual water-line, it was seamed and fissured, but its summit rose up  in a narrow, flat-topped peak. At low tide twenty feet of it was above  water, but at high tide it was six feet and often more under water.    I pushed Uncle Richard's small flat down the rough path and rowed out  to Island Rock. Arriving there, I thrust the painter deep into a  narrow cleft. This was the usual way of mooring it, and no doubt of  its safety occurred to me.    I scrambled up the rock and around to the eastern end, where there was  a broader space for standing and from which some capital views could  be obtained. The sea about the rock was calm, but there was quite a  swell on and an off-shore breeze was blowing. There were no boats  visible. The tide was low, leaving bare the curious caves and  headlands along shore, and I secured a number of excellent snapshots.  It was now three o'clock. I must wait another hour yet before I could  get the best view of the \"Hole in the Wall\"--a huge, arch-like opening  through a jutting headland to the west of me. I went around to look at  it, when I saw a sight that made me stop short in dismay. This was  nothing less than the flat, drifting outward around the point. The  swell and suction of the water around the rock must have pulled her  loose--and I was a prisoner! At first my only feeling was one of  annoyance. Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with  fear. The tide would be high that night. If I could not escape from  Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned.    I sat down limply on a ledge and tried to look matters fairly in the  face. I could not swim; calls for help could not reach anybody; my  only hope lay in the chance of somebody passing down the shore or of  some boat appearing.    I looked at my watch. It was a quarter past three. The tide would  begin to turn about five, but it would be at least ten before the rock  would be covered. I had, then, little more than six hours to live  unless rescued.    The flat was by this time out of sight around the point. I hoped that  the sight of an empty flat drifting down shore might attract someone's  attention and lead to investigation. That seemed to be my only hope.  No alarm would be felt at Uncle Richard's because of my  non-appearance. They would suppose I had gone to Uncle Adam's.    I have heard of time seeming long to a person in my predicament, but  to me it seemed fairly to fly, for every moment decreased my chance of  rescue. I determined I would not give way to cowardly fear, so, with a  murmured prayer for help, I set myself to the task of waiting for  death as bravely as possible. At intervals I shouted as loudly as I  could and, when the sun came to the proper angle for the best view of  the \"Hole in the Wall,\" I took the picture. It afterwards turned out  to be a great success, but I have never been able to look at it  without a shudder.    At five the tide began to come in. Very, very slowly the water rose  around Island Rock. Up, up, up it came, while I watched it with  fascinated eyes, feeling like a rat in a trap. The sun fell lower and  lower; at eight o'clock the moon rose large and bright; at nine it was  a lovely night, dear, calm, bright as day, and the water was swishing  over the highest ledge of the rock. With some difficulty I climbed to  the top and sat there to await the end. I had no longer any hope of  rescue but, by a great effort, I preserved self-control. If I had to  die, I would at least face death staunchly. But when I thought of my  mother at home, it tasked all my energies to keep from breaking down  utterly.    Suddenly I heard a whistle. Never was sound so sweet. I stood up and  peered eagerly shoreward. Coming around the \"Hole in the Wall\"  headland, on top of the cliffs, I saw a boy and a dog. I sent a wild  halloo ringing shoreward.    The boy started, stopped and looked out towards Island Rock. The next  moment he hailed me. It was Ernest's voice, and it was Laddie who was  barking beside him.    \"Ernest,\" I shouted wildly, \"run for help--quick! quick! The tide will  be over the rock in half an hour! Hurry, or you will be too late!\"    Instead of starting off at full speed, as I expected him to do, Ernest  stood still for a moment, and then began to pick his steps down a  narrow path over the cliff, followed by Laddie.    \"Ernest,\" I shouted frantically, \"what are you doing? Why don't you go  for help?\"    Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the  water-line. I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm.    \"It would take too long,\" he shouted. \"By the time I got to the Cove  and a boat could row back here, you'd be drowned. Laddie and I will  save you. Is there anything there you can tie a rope to? I've a coil  of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you. I've been  down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle.\"    I looked about me; a smooth, round hole had been worn clean through a  thin part of the apex of the rock.    \"I could fasten the rope if I had it!\" I called. \"But how can you get  it to me?\"    For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into  Laddie's mouth. The next minute the dog was swimming out to me. As  soon as he came close I caught the rope. It was just long enough to  stretch from shore to rock, allowing for a couple of hitches which  Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge. I tied my camera case  on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket, then I  slipped into the water and, holding to the rope, went hand over hand  to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me. Ernest held on to the  shoreward end of the rope like grim death, a task that was no light  one for his small arms. When I finally scrambled up beside him, his  face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf.    \"Ern, you are a brick!\" I exclaimed. \"You've saved my life!\"    \"No, it was Laddie,\" said Ernest, refusing to take any credit at all.    We hurried home and arrived at Uncle Richard's about ten, just as they  were going to bed. When Uncle Richard heard what had happened, he  turned very pale, and murmured, \"Thank God!\" Aunt Kate got me out of  my wet clothes as quickly as possible, put me away to bed in hot  blankets and dosed me with ginger tea. I slept like a top and felt  none the worse for my experience the next morning.    At the breakfast table Uncle Richard scarcely spoke. But, just as we  finished, he said abruptly to Ernest, \"I'm not going to sell Laddie.  You and the dog saved Ned's life between you, and no dog who helped do  that is ever going to be sold by me. Henceforth he belongs to you. I  give him to you for your very own.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Lawson!\" said Ernest, with shining eyes.    I never saw a boy look "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#4)"],[1,"marry that starving country doctor of yours, I  suppose?\"    I flared up then; Alicia might abuse me all she liked, but I wasn't  going to hear a word against Jack.    \"Yes, I will, if he'll have me,\" I said, and I marched out of the room  and upstairs, with my head very high.    Of course I decided to leave Montreal as soon as I could. But I  couldn't get away within a week, and it was a very unpleasant one.  Alicia treated me with icy indifference, and I knew I should never be  reinstated in her good graces.    To my surprise, Roger took my part. \"Let the girl alone,\" he told  Alicia. \"If she doesn't love Sinclair, she was right in refusing him.  I, for one, am glad that she has got enough truth and womanliness in  her to keep her from selling herself.\"    Then he came to the library where I was moping, and laid his hand on  my head.    \"Little girl,\" he said earnestly, \"no matter what anyone says to you,  never marry a man for his money or for any other reason on earth  except because you love him.\"    This comforted me greatly, and I did not cry myself to sleep that  night as usual.    At last I got away. I had telegraphed to Jack: \"Am coming home  Wednesday; meet me at train,\" and I knew he would be there. How I  longed to see him again--dear, old, badly treated Jack.    I got to Valleyfield just at dusk. It was a rainy evening, and  everything was slush and fog and gloom. But away up I saw the home  light at Thrush Hill, and Jack was waiting for me on the platform.    \"Oh, Jack!\" I said, clinging to him, regardless of appearances. \"Oh,  I'm so glad to be back.\"    \"That's right, Kitty. I knew you wouldn't forget us. How well you are  looking!\"    \"I suppose I ought to be looking wretched,\" I said penitently. \"I've  been behaving very badly, Jack. Wait till we get away from the crowd  and I'll tell you all about it.\"    And I did.    I didn't gloss over anything, but just confessed the whole truth. Jack  heard me through in silence, and then he kissed me.    \"Can you forgive me, Jack, and take me back?\" I whispered, cuddling up  to him.    And he said--but, on second thought, I will not write down what he  said.    We are to be married in June.          A Substitute Journalist      Clifford Baxter came into the sitting-room where Patty was darning  stockings and reading a book at the same time. Patty could do things  like that. The stockings were well darned too, and Patty understood  and remembered what she read.    Clifford flung himself into a chair with a sigh of weariness. \"Tired?\"  queried Patty sympathetically.    \"Yes, rather. I've been tramping about the wharves all day gathering  longshore items. But, Patty, I've got a chance at last. Tonight as I  was leaving the office Mr. Harmer gave me a real assignment for  tomorrow--two of them in fact, but only one of importance. I'm to go  and interview Mr. Keefe on this new railroad bill that's up before the  legislature. He's in town, visiting his old college friend, Mr. Reid,  and he's quite big game. I wouldn't have had the assignment, of  course, if there'd been anyone else to send, but most of the staff  will be away all day tomorrow to see about that mine explosion at  Midbury or the teamsters' strike at Bainsville, and I'm the only one  available. Harmer gave me a pretty broad hint that it was my chance to  win my spurs, and that if I worked up a good article out of it I'd  stand a fair show of being taken on permanently next month when Alsop  leaves. There'll be a shuffle all round then, you know. Everybody on  the staff will be pushed up a peg, and that will leave a vacant space  at the foot.\"    Patty threw down her darning needle and clapped her hands with  delight. Clifford gazed at her admiringly, thinking that he had the  prettiest sister in the world--she was so bright, so eager, so rosy.    \"Oh, Clifford, how splendid!\" she exclaimed. \"Just as we'd begun to  give up hope too. Oh, you must get the position! You must hand in a  good write-up. Think what it means to us.\"    \"Yes, I know.\" Clifford dropped his head on his hand and stared  rather moodily at the lamp. \"But my joy is chastened, Patty. Of course  I want to get the permanency, since it seems to be the only possible  thing, but you know my heart isn't really in newspaper work. The plain  truth is I don't like it, although I do my best. You know Father  always said I was a born mechanic. If I only could get a position  somewhere among machinery--that would be my choice. There's one vacant  in the Steel and Iron Works at Bancroft--but of course I've no chance  of getting it.\"    \"I know. It's too bad,\" said Patty, returning to her stockings with a  sigh. \"I wish I were a boy with a foothold on the _Chronicle_. I  firmly believe that I'd make a good newspaper woman, if such a thing  had ever been heard of in Aylmer.\"    \"That you would. You've twice as much knack in that line as I have.  You seem to know by instinct just what to leave out and put in. I  never do, and Harmer has to blue-pencil my copy mercilessly. Well,  I'll do my best with this, as it's very necessary I should get the  permanency, for I fear our family purse is growing very slim. Mother's  face has a new wrinkle of worry every day. It hurts me to see it.\"    \"And me,\" sighed Patty. \"I do wish I could find something to do too.  If only we both could get positions, everything would be all right.  Mother wouldn't have to worry so. Don't say anything about this chance  to her until you see what comes of it. She'd only be doubly  disappointed if nothing did. What is your other assignment?\"    \"Oh, I've got to go out to Bancroft on the morning train and write up  old Mr. Moreland's birthday celebration. He is a hundred years old,  and there's going to be a presentation and speeches and that sort of  thing. Nothing very exciting about it. I'll have to come back on the  three o'clock train and hurry out to catch my politician before he  leaves at five. Take a stroll down to meet my train, Patty. We can go  out as far as Mr. Reid's house together, and the walk will do you  good.\"    The Baxters lived in Aylmer, a lively little town with two  newspapers, the _Chronicle_ and the _Ledger_. Between these two was a  sharp journalistic rivalry in the matter of \"beats\" and \"scoops.\" In  the preceding spring Clifford had been taken on the _Chronicle_ on  trial, as a sort of general handyman. There was no pay attached to the  position, but he was getting training and there was the possibility of  a permanency in September if he proved his mettle. Mr. Baxter had died  two years before, and the failure of the company in which Mrs.  Baxter's money was invested had left the little family dependent on  their own resources. Clifford, who had cherished dreams of a course in  mechanical engineering, knew that he must give them up and go to the  first work that offered itself, which he did staunchly and  uncomplainingly. Patty, who hitherto had had no designs on a \"career,\"  but had been sunnily content to be a home girl and Mother's right  hand, also realized that it would be well to look about her for  something to do. She was not really needed so far as the work of the  little house went, and the whole burden must not be allowed to fall on  Clifford's eighteen-year-old shoulders. Patty was his senior by a  year, and ready to do her part unflinchingly.    The next afternoon Patty went down to meet Clifford's train. When it  came, no Clifford appeared. Patty stared about her at the hurrying  throngs in bewilderment. Where was Clifford? Hadn't he come on the  train? Surely he must have, for there was no other until seven  o'clock. She must have missed him somehow. Patty waited until  everybody had left the station, then she walked slowly homeward. As  the _Chronicle_ office was on her way, she dropped in to see if  Clifford had reported there.    She found nobody in the editorial offices except the office boy, Larry  Brown, who promptly informed her that not only had Clifford not  arrived, but that there was a telegram from him saying that he had  missed his train. Patty gasped in dismay. It was dreadful!    \"Where is Mr. Harmer?\" she asked.    \"He went home as soon as the afternoon edition came out. He left  before the telegram came. He'll be furious when he finds out that  nobody has gone to interview that foxy old politician,\" said Larry,  who knew all about Clifford's assignment and its importance.    \"Isn't there anyone else here to go?\" queried Patty desperately.    Larry shook his head. \"No, there isn't a soul in. We're mighty  short-handed just now on account of the explosion and the strike.\"    Patty went downstairs and stood for a moment in the hall, rapt in  reflection. If she had been at home, she verily believed she would  have sat down and cried. Oh, it was too bad, too disappointing!  Clifford would certainly lose all chance of the permanency, even if  the irate news editor did not discharge him at once. What could she  do? Could she do anything? She _must_ do something.    \"If I only could go in his place,\" moaned Patty softly to herself.    Then she started. Why not? Why not go and interview the big man  herself? To be sure, she did not know a great deal about interviewing,  still less about railroad bills, and nothing at all about politics.  But if she did her best it might be better than nothing, and might at  least save Clifford his present hold.    With Patty, to decide was to act. She flew back to the reporters'  room, pounced on a pencil and tablet, and hurried off, her breath  coming quickly, and her eyes shining with excitement. It was quite a  long walk out to Mr. Reid's place and Patty was tired when she got  there, but her courage was not a whit abated. She mounted the steps  and rang the bell undauntedly.    \"Can I see Mr.--Mr.--Mr.--\" Patty paused for a moment in dismay. She  had forgotten the name. The maid who had come to the door looked her  over so superciliously that Patty flushed with indignation. \"The  "]]]
