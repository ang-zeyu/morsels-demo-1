The church looked with an evil eye on many of the  greatest improvements and agitations of the age, and attempted to  suppress the spirit of insurrection which had arisen against the  abuses and follies of past ages. Great ideas were ridiculed, and  daring spirits were crushed. There were many good men in the church  who saw and who lamented prevailing corruptions, but their voice was  overwhelmed by the clamors of interested partisans, or silenced by the  authority of the popes. The character of the popes themselves was not  what was expected of the heads of the visible church, or what was  frequently exhibited in those ignorant and superstitious times, when  the papacy fulfilled, in the opinion of many enlightened Protestants,  a benevolent mission. None had the disinterestedness of Gregory I., or  the talents of Gregory VII. There had been a time when the great  central spiritual monarchy of Rome had been exercised for the peace  and tranquillity of Europe, when it was uniformly opposed to slavery  and war, and when it was a mild and paternal government, which  protected innocence and weakness, while it punished injustice and  crime. The time was, when popes had been elevated for their piety and  learning, and when they lived as saints and died as martyrs. But that  time had passed. The Roman church did not keep up with the spirit or  the wants of the age, and moreover did not reform itself from vices  which had been overlooked in ages of ignorance and superstition. In  the fifteenth century, many great abuses scandalized a body of men who  should have been the lights of the world; and the sacred pontiffs  themselves set examples of unusual depravity. Julius II. marched at  the head of armies. Alexander VI. secured his election by bribery, and  reigned by extortion. He poisoned his own cardinals, and bestowed on  his son Caesar Borgia--an incarnated demon--the highest dignities and  rewards. It was common for the popes to sell the highest offices in  the church for money, to place boys on episcopal thrones, to absolve  the most heinous and scandalous crimes for gold, to encourage the  massacre of heretics, and to disgrace themselves by infamous vices.  And a general laxity of morals existed among all orders of the clergy.  They were ignorant, debauched, and ambitious. The monks were  exceedingly numerous; had ceased to be men of prayer and  contemplation, as in the days of Benedict and Bernard; and might be  seen frequenting places of demoralizing excitement, devoted to  pleasure, and enriched by inglorious gains.    But the evils which the church encouraged were more dangerous than the  vices of its members. These evils were inherent in the papal system,  and were hard to be subverted. There were corruptions of doctrine, and  corruptions in the government and customs of the church.    [Sidenote: Papal Infallibility.]    There generally prevailed, throughout Christendom, the belief in papal  infallibility, which notion subverted the doctrines of the Bible, and  placed its truths, at least, on a level with the authority of the  schoolmen. It favored the various usurpations of the popes, and  strengthened the bonds of spiritual despotism.    The popes also claimed a control over secular princes, as well as the  supremacy of the church. Hildebrand was content with riveting the  chains of universal spiritual authority, the evil and absurdity of  which cannot well be exaggerated; but his more ambitious successors  sought to reduce the kings of the earth to perfect vassalage, and,  when in danger of having their monstrous usurpations torn from them,  were ready to fill the world with discord and war.    But the worldly popes of the fifteenth century also aspired to be  temporal princes. They established the most elegant court in Europe;  they supported large armies; they sought to restore the splendor of  imperial Rome; they became ambitious of founding great families; they  enriched their nephews and relations at the sacrifice of the best  interests of their church; they affected great state and dignity; they  built gorgeous palaces; they ornamented their capital with pictures  and statues.    The territories of Rome were, however, small. The lawful revenues of  the popes were insufficient to gratify their extravagance and pomp.  But money, nevertheless, they must have. In order to raise it, they  resorted to extortion and corruption. They imposed taxes on  Christendom, direct and indirect. These were felt as an intolerable  burden; but such was the superstition of the times, that they were  successfully raised. But even these were insufficient to gratify papal  avarice and rapacity. They then resorted, in their necessities, to the  meanest acts, imposed on the simplicity of their subjects, and finally  adopted the most infamous custom which ever disgraced the world.    [Sidenote: The Sale of Indulgences.]    They pardoned sins for money--granted sales of indulgences for crime.  A regular scale for absolution was graded. A proclamation was made  every fifty, and finally every twenty-five years, of a year of  jubilee, when plenary remission of all sin was promised to those who  should make a pilgrimage to Rome. And so great was the influx of  strangers, and consequently of wealth, to Rome, that, on one occasion,  it was collected into piles by rakes. It is computed that two hundred  thousand deluded persons visited the city in a single month. But the  vast sums they brought to Rome, and the still greater sums which were  obtained by the sale of indulgences, and by various taxations, were  all squandered in ornamenting the city, and in supporting a luxurious  court, profligate cardinals, and superfluous ministers of a corrupted  religion. Then was erected the splendid church of St. Peter, more  after the style of Grecian temples, than after the model of the Gothic  cathedrals of York and Cologne. Glorious was that monument of reviving  art; wonderful was its lofty dome; but the vast sums required to build  it opened the eyes of Christendom to the extravagance and presumption  of the popes; and this splendid trophy of their glory also became the  emblem of their broken power. Their palaces and temples made an  imposing show, but detracted from their real strength, which consisted  in the affections of their spiritual subjects. Their outward grandeur,  like the mechanical agencies which kings employ, was but a poor  substitute for the invisible power of love,--in all ages, and among  all people, \"that cheap defence\" which supports thrones and kingdoms.    [Sidenote: The Corruptions of the Church.]    Another great evil was, the prevalence of an idolatrous spirit. In the  churches and chapels, and even in private families, were innumerable  images of saints, pictures of the Virgin, relics, crucifixes, &c.,  designed at first to kindle a spirit of devotion among the rude and  uneducated, but gradually becoming objects of real adoration.  Intercessions were supposed to be made by the Virgin Mary, and by  favorite saints, more efficacious with Deity than the penitence and  prayers of the erring and sinful themselves. The influence of this  veneration for martyrs and saints was degrading to the mind, and  became a very lucrative source of profit to the priests, who peddled  the bones and relics of saints as they did indulgences, and who  invented innumerable lies to attest the genuineness and antiquity of  the objects they sold, all of which were parts of the great system of  fraud and avarice which the church permitted.    Again; the public worship of God was in a language the people could  not understand, but rendered impressive by the gorgeous dresses of the  priests, and the magnificence of the altar, and the images and vessels  of silver and gold, reflecting their splendor, by the light of wax  candles, on the sombre pillars, roofs, and windows of the Gothic  church, and the effect heightened by exciting music, and other appeals  to the taste or imagination, rather than to the reason and the heart.  The sermons of the clergy were frivolous, and ill adapted to the  spiritual wants of the people. \"Men went to the Vatican,\" says the  learned and philosophical Ranke, \"not to pray, but to contemplate the  Belvidere Apollo. They disgraced the most solemn festivals by open  profanations. The clergy, in their services, sought the means of  exciting laughter. One would mock the cuckoo, and another recite  indecent stories about St. Peter.\" Luther, when he visited Italy, was  extremely shocked at the infidel spirit which prevailed among the  clergy, who were hostile to the circulation of the Scriptures, and who  encouraged persecutions and inquisitions. This was the age when the  dreadful tribunal of the Inquisition flourished, although its chief  enormities were perpetrated in Spain and Portugal. It never had an  existence in England, and but little influence in France and Germany.  But if the Church did not resort, in all countries, to that dread  tribunal which subjected youth, beauty, and innocence to the  inquisitorial vengeance of narrow-minded Dominican monks, still she  was hostile to free inquiry, and to all efforts made to emancipate the  reason of men.    The spirit of religious persecution, which inflamed the Roman Church  to punish all dissenters from the doctrine and abuses she promulgated,  can never be questioned. The Waldenses and Albigenses had suffered, in  darker times, almost incredible hardships and miseries--had been  almost annihilated by the dreadful crusade which was carried on  against them, so that two hundred thousand had perished for supposed  heresy. But reference is not now made to this wholesale massacre, but  to those instances of individual persecution which showed the extreme  jealousy and hatred of Rome of all new opinions. John Huss and Jerome  of Prague were publicly burned for attempting to reform the church,  and even Savonarola, who did not deny the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#4)"],[1,"for a short  while. Presently some woman gets up to renew the fires, or to see to  some other domestic work. Roused by the noise which she makes, all the  dogs of the settlement break into a chorus of barks and yelps. This  wakes the children, who begin to scream. The men turn in their hammocks,  and immediately resume their stories, apparently from the point at which  they left off, and as if they had never ceased. This time it is but a  short interruption to the silence of the night; and before long  everything again becomes quiet, till some new outbreak is caused, much  as was the last. In the very middle of the night there are perhaps some  hours of quiet. But about an hour before dawn, some of the men having to  go out to hunt, effectually wake everybody about them by playing flutes,  or beating drums, as they go to bathe before leaving the settlement.\"[8]    But the folk-tale cannot be separated in this inquiry from the folk-song  with which, in its origin and development, it is so closely connected.  In India there are, or were until recent years, everywhere professional  bards; and the stories told in Indian villages are frequently the  substance of the chants of these bards. More than this, the line between  singing and narration is so faintly drawn, that the bards themselves  often interpose great patches of prose between the metrical portions of  their recitations. Fairs, festivals, and marriages all over India are  attended by the bards, who are always ready to perform for pay and  drink. Mr. Leland believes the stories he obtained from the Christian  Algonkins of New England, concerning the ancient heroes of the race and  other mythical personages, to have once been delivered as poems from  generation to generation and always chanted. The deeds of Maori warriors  are handed down in song; just as we find in Beowulf, the story of  Hrothgar's ancestors was sung before his own companions-in-arms by his  gleemen to the accompaniment of some instrument after the mead cup had  gone round. The Roman historian attests the prevalence among the German  tribes of ancient songs, which he expressly mentions as their only kind  of memory or record,--thus showing that all their tales, whether  mythologic or heroic, were for better preservation cast into metrical  form. Some of these, enshrining the deeds of their heroes, were chanted  on going into battle, in order to arouse the warriors' courage. And as  far back as the light of history, or of literature, penetrates, not only  the Teutonic, but also the Celtic nations loved to have their actions  celebrated thus. To a Welsh king his household bard was as necessary as  his domestic chaplain, or his court physician, and in the ancient laws  his duties, his precedence, his perquisites, and even the songs he was  expected to sing, are minutely prescribed. The bards were organized into  a regular order, or college, with an official chief. They were not  merely singers or poets, but also tale-tellers; and from the Mabinogion  we gather that listening to songs and tales was one of the habitual, if  not daily pastimes, of a court.[9]    It is needless to follow through the Middle Ages the history of the  troubadour, the minstrel and the jongleur, who played so large part in  the social life of those times. Many of them were retainers of noblemen  and kings; but others roamed about from place to place, singing their  lays and reciting their stories (for they dealt in prose as well as  verse), very much in the manner of the Indian bards just mentioned.  Their stock-in-trade must have been partly traditional and partly of  their own composition. In this respect they were probably less  hide-bound than their Indian brethren are. For the latter, whether  retainers of the native grandees, as many of them are, or members of the  humbler class of wandering minstrels, are expected to repeat their lays  as they have received them. But, although in the main these professional  gentlemen adhere to the traditional words which they know by heart, the  temptation must be very strong to foist at suitable pauses into their  tales impromptu passages--best described in stage language as  \"gag\"--which they think will be acceptable to their audience. And  whether or not this be actually the case with the Indian bards, we are  expressly told that it is so with the Arab story-teller, and that it  accounts for much of the ribaldry and filth which have become embedded  in the immortal \"Nights.\" A viol having only one string accompanies the  passages in verse with which the stories are interlarded; and a similar  instrument seems to be used for the like purpose among the orthodox  Guslars of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[10] A description given by Sir  Richard Burton of a story-teller at the bazaar at Tangier may stand,  except as to the external details, for that of an Arab reciter  throughout Northern Africa and the Moslem East. \"The market people,\" he  says, \"form a ring about the reciter, a stalwart man, affecting little  raiment besides a broad waist-belt into which his lower chiffons are  tucked, and noticeable only for his shock hair, wild eyes, broad grin,  and generally disreputable aspect. He usually handles a short stick;  and, when drummer and piper are absent, he carries a tiny tomtom shaped  like an hour-glass, upon which he taps the periods. This Scealuidhe, as  the Irish call him, opens the drama with an extempore prayer, proving  that he and the audience are good Moslems; he speaks slowly and with  emphasis, varying the diction with breaks of animation, abundant action  and the most comical grimace: he advances, retires, and wheels about,  illustrating every point with pantomime; and his features, voice and  gestures are so expressive that even Europeans who cannot understand a  word of Arabic, divine the meaning of his tale. The audience stands  breathless and motionless, surprising strangers by the ingenuousness and  freshness of feeling hidden under their hard and savage exterior. The  performance usually ends with the embryo actor going round for alms, and  flourishing in the air every silver bit, the usual honorarium being a  few _f'lus_, that marvellous money of Barbary, big coppers worth  one-twelfth of a penny.\" Another writer, who has published modern Arab  folk-tales, obtained eleven out of twelve from his cook, a man who could  neither read nor write, but possessed an excellent memory. His stories  were derived from his mother and aunts, and from old women who  frequented his early home. The remaining tale was dictated by a sheikh  with some, though small, pretensions to education, and this tale, though  at bottom a genuine folk-tale, presented traces of literary  manipulation.[11]    The literary touches here spoken of were probably not impromptu. But it  must be admitted that the tendency to insert local colouring and \"gag\"  is almost irresistible amongst the Arabs. Dr. Steere notices it as a  characteristic of the story-tellers of the Swahili, a people of mixed  Arab and Negro descent at Zanzibar;[12] and it is perhaps inevitable in  a professional reciter whose audience, like himself, is restless and  vivacious in so high a degree. The only case in which any restraint  would be certain to be felt is where a narrative believed to be of  religious import is given. Under the influence of religious feeling the  most mobile of races become conservative; and traditions of a sacred  character are the most likely of all to be handed down unchanged from  father to son. Directly we get outside the charmed circle of religious  custom, precept, and story, the awe which has the most powerful effect  in preserving tradition intact ceases to work; and we are left to a  somewhat less conservative force of habit to retain the old form of  words and the time-honoured ceremonies. Still this force is powerful;  the dislike of voluntary change forbids amendment even of formularies  which have long ceased to be understood, and have often become  ridiculous because their meaning has been lost. It is by no means an  uncommon thing for the rustic story-teller to be unable to explain  expressions, and indeed whole episodes, in any other way than Uncle  Remus, when called upon to say who Miss Meadows was: \"She wuz in de  tale, Miss Meadows en de gals wuz, en de tale I give you like hi't wer'  gun ter me.\" Dr. Steere, speaking of a collection of Swahili tales by M.  Jablonsky which I think has never been published, tells us that almost  all of the tales had \"sung parts,\" and of some of these even they who  sang them could scarcely explain the meaning. Here we may observe the  connection with the folk-song; and it is a strong evidence of adherence  to ancient tradition. Frequently in Dr. Steere's own experience the  skeleton of the story seemed to be contained in these snatches of song,  which were connected together by an account, apparently extemporized, of  the intervening history. In these latter portions, if the hypothesis of  extemporization were correct, the words of course would be different,  but the substance might remain untouched. I suspect, however, that the  extemporization was nothing like so complete as the learned writer  imagined, but rather that the tale, as told with song and narrative  mingled, was in a state of gradual decay or transition from verse to  prose, and that the prose portions were, to almost as great an extent as  the verse, traditional.    Be this as it may, the tenacity with which the illiterate story-teller  generally adheres to the substance and to the very words of his  narrative is remarkable--and this in spite of the freedom sometimes  taken of dramatic illustration, and the license to introduce occasional  local and personal allusions and \"gag.\" These are easily separable from  the genuine tale. What Dr. Rink says of the Eskimo story-telling holds  good, more or less, all over the world. \"The art,\" he states, \"requires  the ancient tales to be"]]]
