As they approached the shore, Strong Desire saw that the  ribs of the sorcerer's canoe were formed of living rattlesnakes, whose  heads pointed outward to guard him from his enemies. Being invited, he  had no sooner stepped into the canoe, than they began to hiss and rattle  furiously, which put him in a great fright; but the magician spoke to  them, when they became pacified and quiet. Shortly after they were at  the landing upon the island. The marriage took place immediately; and  the bride made presents of various valuables which had been furnished  her by the old witch who inhabited the cloudy lodge.    As they were sitting in the lodge, surrounded by the friends and  relatives, the mother of the Red Head regarded the face of her new  daughter-in-law for a long time with fixed attention. From this scrutiny  she was convinced that this singular and hasty marriage boded no good to  her son. She drew him aside, and disclosed to him her suspicions. This  can be no female, said she; she has the figure and manners, the  countenance, and more especially the eyes, are beyond a doubt those of a  man. Her husband rejected her suspicions, and rebuked her severely for  entertaining such notions of her own daughter-in-law. She still urged  her doubts, which so vexed the husband that he broke his pipe-stem in  her face, and called her an owl.    This act astonished the company, who sought an explanation; and it was  no sooner given, than the mock bride, rising with an air of offended  dignity, informed the Red Head that after receiving so gross an affront  from his relatives she could not think of remaining with him as his  wife, but should forthwith return to her own friends.    With a toss of the head, like that of an angry female, Strong Desire  left the lodge, followed by Red Head, and walked away until he came to  the beach of the island, near the spot where they had first landed. Red  Head entreated him to remain, urging every motive, and making all sorts  of magnificent promises--none of which seemed to make the least  impression. Strong Desire, Red Head thought, was very hard-hearted.  During these appeals they had seated themselves upon the ground, and Red  Head, in great affliction, reclined his head upon his fancied wife's  lap. Strong Desire now changed his manner, was very kind and soothing,  and suggested in the most winning accent that if Red Head would sleep  soundly for awhile he might possibly dream himself out of all his  troubles. Red Head, delighted at so happy a prospect, said that he would  fall asleep immediately.    \"You have killed a good many men in your time, Red Head,\" said Strong  Desire, by way of suggesting an agreeable train of ideas to the  sorcerer.    \"Hundreds,\" answered Red Head; \"and what is better, now that I am fairly  settled in life by this happy marriage, I shall be able to give my whole  attention to massacre.\"    \"And you will kill hundreds more,\" interposed Strong Desire, in the most  insinuating manner imaginable.    \"Just so, my dear,\" Red Head replied, with a great leer; \"thousands.  There will be no end to my delicious murders. I love dearly to kill  people. I would like to kill you if you were not my wife.\"    \"There, there,\" said Strong Desire, with the coaxing air of a little  coquette, \"go to sleep; that's a good Red Head.\"    No other subject of conversation occurring to the chief, now that he had  exhausted the delightful topic of wholesale murder, he straightway fell  into a deep sleep.    The chance so anxiously sought for had come; and Strong Desire, with a  smiling eye, drawing his blade of grass with lightning swiftness once  across the neck of the Red Head, severed the huge and wicked head from  the body.    In a moment, stripping off his woman's dress, underneath which he had  all along worn his male attire, Strong Desire seized the bleeding  trophy, plunged into the lake, and swam safely over to the main shore.  He had scarcely reached it, when, looking back, he saw amid the darkness  the torches of persons come out in search of the new married couple. He  listened until they had found the headless body, and he heard their  piercing shrieks of rage and sorrow as he took his way to the lodge of  his kind adviser.    The little old woman who makes war was in an excellent humor, and she  received Strong Desire with rejoicing. She admired his prudence, and  assured him his bravery should never be questioned again. Lifting up the  head, which she gazed upon with vast delight, she said he need only have  brought the scalp. Cutting off a lock of the hair for herself, she told  him he might now return with the head, which would be evidence of an  achievement that would cause his own people to respect him.    \"In your way home,\" added the little old woman, \"you will meet with but  one difficulty. Maunkahkeesh, the Spirit of the Earth, requires an  offering or sacrifice from all of her sons who perform extraordinary  deeds. As you walk along in a prairie there will be an earthquake; the  earth will open and divide the prairie in the middle. Take this  partridge and throw it into the opening, and instantly spring over it.\"    With many thanks to the little old witch, who had so faithfully  befriended him, Strong Desire took leave of her, and having, by the  course pointed out, safely passed the earthquake, he arrived near his  own village. He secretly hid his precious trophy.    On entering the village, he found that his parents had returned from the  place of their spring encampment by the wood-side, and that they were in  heavy sorrowing for their son, whom they supposed to be lost. One and  another of the young men had presented themselves to the disconsolate  parents, and said, \"Look up, I am your son;\" but when they looked up,  they beheld not the familiar face of Strong Desire.    Having been often deceived in this manner, when their own son in truth  presented himself they sat with their heads down, and with their eyes  nearly blinded with weeping. It was some time before they could be  prevailed upon to bestow a glance upon him. It was still longer before  they could recognize him as their son who had refused to draw water from  the river, at night, for fear, for his countenance was no longer that  of a timid stripling; it was that of a man who has seen and done great  things, and who has the heart to do greater still.    When he recounted his adventures they believed him mad. The young men  laughed at him--him, Strong Desire--who feared to walk to the river at  night-time.    He left the lodge, and ere their laughter had ceased, returned with his  trophy. He held aloft the head of the Red Sorcerer, with the great  ghastly leer which lighted it up before his last sleep, at prospect of a  thousand future murders, fresh upon it. It was easily recognized, and  the young men who had scoffed at Strong Desire shrunk into the corners  out of sight. Strong Desire had conquered the terrible Red Head! All  doubts of the truth of his adventures were dispelled.    He was greeted with joy, and placed among the first warriors of the  nation. He finally became a chief, and his family were ever after  respected and esteemed.          IV.    THE WONDERFUL EXPLOITS OF GRASSHOPPER.      A man, of small stature, found himself standing alone on a prairie. He  thought to himself, \"How came I here? Are there no beings on this earth  but myself? I must travel and see. I must walk till I find the abodes of  men.\"    So soon as his mind was made up, he set out, he knew not whither, in  search of habitations. He was a resolute little fellow, and no  difficulties could turn him from his purpose: neither prairies, rivers,  woods nor storms, had the effect to daunt his courage or turn him back.  After traveling a long time, he came to a wood, in which he saw decayed  stumps of trees, as if they had been cut in ancient times, but no other  trace of men. Pursuing his journey, he found more recent marks of the  same kind; after this, he came upon fresh traces of human beings; first  their footsteps, and then the wood they had felled, lying in heaps.  Pushing on, he emerged toward dusk from the forest, and beheld at a  distance a large village of high lodges standing on rising ground.    \"I am tired of this dog-trot,\" he said to himself. \"I will arrive there  on a run.\"    He started off with all his speed. On coming to the first lodge, without  any especial exertion, he jumped over it, and found himself standing by  the door on the other side. Those within saw something pass over the  opening in the roof; they thought from the shadow it cast that it must  have been some huge bird--and then they heard a thump upon the ground.  \"What is that?\" they all said and several ran out to see.    They invited him in, and he found himself in company with an old chief  and several men who were seated in the lodge. Meat was set before him;  after which the old chief asked him whither he was going, and what was  his name. He answered that he was in search of adventures, and that his  name was \"Grasshopper.\"    They all opened their eyes upon the stranger with a broad stare.    \"Grasshopper!\" whispered one to another; and a general titter went  round.    They invited him to stay with them, which he was inclined to do; for it  was a pleasant village, but so small as to constantly embarrass  Grasshopper. He was in perpetual trouble; whenever he shook hands with  a stranger, to whom he might be introduced, such was the abundance of  his strength, without meaning it, he wrung his arm off at the shoulder.  Once or twice, in mere sport, he cuffed the boys, about the lodge, by  the side of the head, and they flew out of sight as though they had been  shot from a bow; nor could they ever be found again, though they were  searched for in all the country round, far and wide. If Grasshopper  proposed to himself a short stroll in the morning, he was at once miles  out of town. When he entered a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2225"],[0,"\"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks (#4)"],[1,"aow?\" said the skipper \"Walked into Dan, hev ye?\"    \"No; it's about you.\"    \"I'm here to listen.\"    \"Well, I--I'm here to take things back,\" said Harvey, very quickly.  \"When a man's saved from drowning--\" he gulped.    \"Ey? You'll make a man yet ef you go on this way.\"    \"He oughtn't begin by calling people names.\"    \"Jest an' right--right an' jest,\" said Troop, with the ghost of a dry  smile.    \"So I'm here to say I'm sorry.\" Another big gulp.    Troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held  out an eleven-inch hand. \"I mistrusted 'twould do you sights o' good;  an' this shows I weren't mistook in my jedgments.\" A smothered chuckle  on deck caught his ear. \"I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments.\" The  eleven-inch hand closed on Harvey's, numbing it to the elbow. \"We'll  put a little more gristle to that 'fore we've done with you, young  feller; an' I don't think any worse of ye fer anythin' thet's gone by.  You wasn't fairly responsible. Go right abaout your business an' you  won't take no hurt.\"    \"You're white,\" said Dan, as Harvey regained the deck, flushed to the  tips of his ears.    \"I don't feel it,\" said he.    \"I didn't mean that way. I heard what dad said. When dad allows he  don't think the worse of any man, dad's give himself away. He hates to  be mistook in his jedgments, too. Ho! ho! Onct dad has a jedgment, he'd  sooner dip his colours to the British than change it. I'm glad it's  settled right eend up. Dad's right when he says he can't take you back.  It's all the livin' we make here--fishin'. The men'll be back like  sharks after a dead whale in ha'af an hour.\"    \"What for?\" said Harvey. \"Supper, o' course. Don't your stummick tell  you? You've a heap to learn.\"    \"'Guess I have,\" said Harvey, dolefully, looking at the tangle of ropes  and blocks overhead.    \"She's a daisy,\" said Dan, enthusiastically, misunderstanding the look.  \"Wait till our mainsail's bent, an' she walks home with all her salt  wet. There's some work first, though.\" He pointed down into the  darkness of the open main-hatch between the two masts.    \"What's that for? It's all empty,\" said Harvey.    \"You an' me an' a few more hev got to fill it,\" said Dan. \"That's where  the fish goes.\"    \"Alive?\" said Harvey.    \"Well, no. They're so's to be ruther dead--an' flat--an' salt. There's  a hundred hogshead o' salt in the bins; an' we hain't more'n covered  our dunnage to now.\"    \"Where are the fish, though?\"    \"'In the sea, they say; in the boats, we pray,'\" said Dan, quoting a  fisherman's proverb. \"You come in last night with 'baout forty of 'em.\"    He pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarter-deck.    \"You an' me we'll sluice that out when they're through. 'Send we'll hev  full pens to-night! I've seen her down ha'af a foot with fish waitin'  to clean, an' we stood to the tables till we was splittin' ourselves  instid o' them, we was so sleepy. Yes, they're comin' in naow.\" Dan  looked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen dories rowing towards them  over the shining, silky sea.    \"I've never seen the sea from so low down,\" said Harvey. \"It's fine.\"    The low sun made the water all purple and pinkish, with golden lights  on the barrels of the long swells, and blue and green mackerel shades  in the hollows. Each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories  towards her by invisible strings, and the little black figures in the  tiny boats pulled like clockwork toys.    \"They've struck on good,\" said Dan, between his half-shut eyes. \"Manuel  hain't room fer another fish. Low ez a lily-pad in still water, ain't  he?\"    \"Which is Manuel? I don't see how you can tell 'em 'way off, as you do.\"    \"Last boat to the south'ard. He f'und you last night,\" said Dan,  pointing. \"Manuel rows Portugoosey; ye can't mistake him. East o'  him--he's a heap better'n he rows--is Pennsylvania. Loaded with  saleratus, by the looks of him. East o' him--see how pretty they string  out all along with the humpy shoulders, is Long Jack. He's a Galway man  inhabitin' South Boston, where they all live mostly, an' mostly them  Galway men are good in a boat. North, away yonder--you'll hear him tune  up in a minute--is Tom Platt. Man-o'-war's man he was on the old  Ohio--first of our navy, he says, to go araound the Horn. He never  talks of much else, 'cept when he sings, but he has fair fishin' luck.  There! What did I tell you?\"    A melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory.  Harvey heard something about somebody's hands and feet being cold, and  then:      \"Bring forth the chart, the doleful chart;    See where them mountings meet!    The clouds are thick around their heads,    The mists around their feet.\"      \"Full boat,\" said Dan, with a chuckle. \"If he gives us 'O Captain' it's  toppin' full.\"    The bellow continued:      \"And naow to thee, O Capting,    Most earnestly I pray    That they shall never bury me    In church or cloister grey.\"    \"Double game for Tom Platt. He'll tell you all about the old Ohio  to-morrow. 'See that blue dory behind him? He's my uncle,--dad's own  brother,--an' ef there's any bad luck loose on the Banks she'll fetch  up ag'in' Uncle Salters, sure. Look how tender he's rowin'. I'll lay my  wage and share he's the only man stung up to-day--an' he's stung up  good.\"    \"What'll sting him?\" said Harvey, getting interested.    \"Strawberries, mostly. Punkins, sometimes, an' sometimes lemons an'  cucumbers. Yes, he's stung up from his elbows down. That man's luck's  perfectly paralysin'. Naow we'll take a-holt o' the tackles an' h'ist  'em in. Is it true, what you told me jest now, that you never done a  hand's turn o' work in all your born life? Must feel kinder awful,  don't it?\"    \"I'm going to try to work, anyway,\" Harvey replied stoutly. \"Only it's  all dead new.\"    \"Lay a-holt o' that tackle, then. Behind ye!\"    Harvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the  stays of the mainmast, while Dan pulled down another that ran from  something he called a \"topping-lift,\" as Manuel drew alongside in his  loaded dory. The Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey  learned to know well later, and a short-handled fork began to throw  fish into the pen on deck. \"Two hundred and thirty-one,\" he shouted.    \"Give him the hook,\" said Dan, and Harvey ran it into Manuel's hands.  He slipped it through a loop of rope at the dory's bow, caught Dan's  tackle, hooked it to the stern-becket, and clambered into the schooner.    \"Pull!\" shouted Dan; and Harvey pulled, astonished to find how easily  the dory rose.    \"Hold on; she don't nest in the crosstrees!\" Dan laughed; and Harvey  held on, for the boat lay in the air above his head.    \"Lower away,\" Dan shouted; and as Harvey lowered, Dan swayed the light  boat with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast.  \"They don't weigh nothin' empty. Thet was right smart fer a passenger.  There's more trick to it in a sea-way.\"    \"Ah ha!\" said Manuel, holding out a brown hand. \"You are some pretty  well now? This time last night the fish they fish for you. Now you fish  for fish. Eh, wha-at?\"    \"I'm--I'm ever so grateful,\" Harvey stammered, and his unfortunate hand  stole to his pocket once more, but he remembered that he had no money  to offer. When he knew Manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he  might have made would cover him with hot, uneasy blushes in his bunk.    \"There is no to be thankful for to me!\" said Manuel. \"How shall I leave  you dreeft, dreeft all around the Banks? Now you are a fisherman eh,  wha-at? Ouh! Auh!\" He bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips  to get the kinks out of himself.    \"I have not cleaned boat to-day. Too busy. They struck on queek. Danny,  my son, clean for me.\"    Harvey moved forward at once. Here was something he could do for the  man who had saved his life.    Dan threw him a swab, and he leaned over the dory, mopping up the slime  clumsily, but with great good-will. \"Hike out the foot-boards; they  slide in them grooves,\" said Dan. \"Swab 'em an' lay 'em down. Never let  a foot-board jam. Ye may want her bad some day. Here's Long Jack.\"    A stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside.    \"Manuel, you take the tackle. I'll fix the tables. Harvey, clear  Manuel's boat. Long Jack's nestin' on the top of her.\"    Harvey looked up from his swabbing at the bottom of another dory just  above his head.    \"Jest like the Injian puzzle-boxes, ain't they?\" said Dan, as the one  boat dropped into the other.    \"Takes to ut like a duck to water,\" said Long Jack, a grizzly-chinned,  long-lipped Galway man, bending to and fro exactly as Manuel had done.  Disko in the cabin growled up the hatchway, and they could hear him  suck his pencil.    \"Wan hunder an' forty-nine an' a half--bad luck to ye, Discobolus!\"  said Long Jack. \"I'm murderin' meself to fill your pockuts. Slate ut  for a bad catch. The Portugee has bate me.\"    Whack came another dory alongside, and more fish shot into the pen.    \"Two hundred and three. Let's look at the passenger!\" The speaker was  even larger than the Galway man, and his face was made curious by a  purple cut running slantways from his left eye to the right corner of  his mouth.    Not knowing what else to do, Harvey swabbed each dory as it came down,  pulled out the foot-boards, and laid them in the bottom of the boat.    \"He's caught on good,\" said the scarred man, who was Tom Platt,  watching him critically. \"There are two ways o' doin' everything. One's  fisher-fashion--any end first an' a slippery hitch over all--an' the  other's--\"    \"What we did on the old Ohio!\" Dan interrupted, brushing into the knot  of men with a long board on legs. \"Git out o' here, Tom Platt, an'  leave me fix the tables.\"    He jammed one end of the board into two nicks in the bulwarks, kicked  out the leg, and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the  man-o'-war's"]]]
