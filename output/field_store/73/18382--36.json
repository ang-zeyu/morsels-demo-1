[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24681"],[0,"Opportunities in Engineering (#4)"],[1,"a profession by  itself, one of the minor branches known as automotive engineering. The  mechanical engineer as a rule works within doors, just as the civil  engineer works out of doors, and his work, consequently, is more  confining. In the pursuit of his profession he spends much of his time  supervising the design of mechanical units, and is the one man  responsible for correct construction and security against fracture of  the machine itself when in operation. Actually the mechanical engineer  has more opportunities in his daily routine for the exercise of his  creative faculties than has any one of the other kinds of engineers, for  the simple reason that no two machines even for the same  purpose--speaking of types, always--are exactly similar in construction.  Two lathes of like size and scope, if manufactured by two separate  organizations, will be different in their minor features, and each in  some particular will be the work of a mechanical engineer whose ideas  are at variance with those of the mechanical engineer who designed the  other type. Engineers, like doctors, often disagree, which accounts for  the many different types of machinery serving the same purpose which are  found on the market.    Electrical engineering is, as its name implies, a profession embracing  all construction whose basis is the electrical current. Any unit  whatsoever, so long as it utilizes or eats up or carries forward a  current of electricity, is the work of electrical engineers. The  profession is a comparatively recent one perforce, owing to the fact  that but very little of a practical nature was known about electricity  until a very few years ago. The wonderful progress in this field made  within the past twenty years is one of the marvels of the engineering  profession. Dynamos, motors, arc-lights, alternating current, the  X-ray--these are a few of the things which followers of the profession  have created for the uses of mankind. The field is yet practically  unexplored, and offers to engineering students an outlet for their  energies--provided they enter this branch of engineering--second to none  of the other branches. A fascinating study, doubly so because of the  fact that nothing is known about electricity itself--its effects only  being understood--electrical engineering should appeal to the  curious-minded as no other vocation can. It is a profession shrouded in  mystery, and not the least mysterious of its recent developments is the  wireless telegraph. What this one development alone holds for the future  nobody can say. All sorts of inventions can be imagined, however, and  among them I myself seem to see automobiles operated from central  stations--indeed, all mechanical movements so operated--to the end that  individual engines in time will cease to be.    The profession of mining engineering, last of the major branches,  embraces all work having to do with the locating and construction of  mines--coal-mines, iron-mines, copper-mines, diamond-mines, gold-mines,  and the like. Also it establishes the nature of the apparatus used,  though more often than otherwise the mechanical engineer in this regard  is consulted, since much of the machinery utilized in mining operations  is the direct work of mechanical engineers. Screens and hoppers are  mechanical devices the result of mechanical engineering genius; but the  work of shoring up, done with timbers, and the work generally of  supervision of all mine operations, rests solely with the mining man.  The shaping of these timbers, though--the cutting of tenons, for  instance--is the work, again, of the mechanical engineer; though the  placing of these timbers, to revert back once more, is the work of the  mining engineer.    There are many minor branches, and more are rapidly coming into  prominence. Chemical engineering is one of the older minor branches;  while industrial engineering--following closely upon automotive  engineering--belongs properly with the more recent of the newcomers.  Efficiency engineering is a branch which to-day is making a strong bid  for recognition as a profession, although the work as yet, lacking, as  it does, proper foundation in scientific truth, even though strongly  humanitarian in its motives, has still to prove itself acceptable among  the engineering groups. Structural engineering, on the contrary,  \"belongs.\" Its work consists of the design and layout of modern steel  structures--this roughly--while the minor branch known as heating and  ventilating engineering, as its name would indicate, deals with the  proper heating and ventilating of buildings, and as a profession is  closely allied with that of structural engineering. Out of these minor  branches come yet other branches, more particularly groups, with each in  the nature of a specialty, such as gas engineering, aircraft  engineering, steam engineering, telephone engineering, and so on.    Students about to enter engineering colleges usually select one or  another of the major branches and then after graduating begin to  specialize. But infrequently Fate has much to do with this  specialization, since after leaving college the average young engineer  will turn to the nearest or most promising vacancy offered him in his  chosen field--a major branch--and in the work eventually become expert  and a specialist. If it be a concern manufacturing steam-turbines, say,  the young engineer in time becomes expert and a specialist in  steam-turbines. So, too, with graduates in mining engineering, in  electrical engineering, in civil engineering, although the opportunities  for specialization in any of these latter branches are not so good as in  the mechanical field. However, entering upon a certain kind of work, the  student usually follows this work to the end of his days, which is  probably what engineering schools expect. All strive to educate only in  the principles of each of the major branches. The rest is up to the  graduate, who is permitted, and generally does, the shaping of his own  career afterward.    It is a feature of our democratic form of government--thanks be! Germany  does--or did--the other thing. Germany made careers for her young men,  instead of young men for careers, with the result that she also made  machines out of them. America is a nation of individualists, which is  what makes America what it is, and our schools and school systems are  responsible.          V    MAKING A CHOICE      About to make a choice among the branches of engineering, the  prospective student, unless he have a decided preference to start with,  finds himself confronted with many difficulties. Engineering is  engineering, whether it be mining or electrical or civil or mechanical,  and this fact alone is not without its confusions. Yet if the young man  decides for a mining career, say, the choice may take him, after  graduating, off to South Africa, whereas if his choice lay in the  electrical field he may never get any farther from home than the nearest  electrical manufacturing plant in his town or state--and remain there  for the duration of his life. This making of a choice is a momentous  thing in a prospective engineer's life. It should be approached with all  caution, and with due regard for the nature of the life he would lead  after graduating from school. If he have a penchant for outdoor life,  then the choice, in a way, is easy. He should select mining or civil  engineering as his particular vocation. If he be of those who prefer to  remain more or less indoors in the practice of his profession,  mechanical or electrical engineering should be his choice.    These are the major advantages or disadvantages, depending upon the  point of view. The minor ones are not so easily stated. Speaking always  for the young man without a decided preference, it is the writer's  opinion that the prospective student should analyze his particular  feelings in the matter and decide accordingly. Large projects may  interest him more than smaller ones. In this regard, he will  find greater satisfaction in following the profession dealing  with large projects, which is, of course, the civil engineering  profession--although mining, too, has its large ventures, which,  however, do not \"break\" as frequently as they do in civil engineering.  On the other hand, the young man may find himself attracted to the  development of small propositions, such as adding-machines and  typewriters and sewing-machines, and the like. Finding himself attracted  to these no less important phases of engineering than the development of  mines or the opening up of new country, the young man can, of course,  make no better choice than to enter the mechanical or the electrical  field.    It all depends upon the point of view. Nor is there any hard-and-fast  rule tying a man down to a single branch once he finds that he does not  like it, or finds that he likes one of the other branches better, after  he has given his chosen branch a trial in the years immediately  following graduation. Not a few mining graduates drift over into  straight civil work after leaving school, and, likewise, not a few in  the electrical branches find themselves in time pursuing mechanical  work. Fate here, as in the matter of specialization, works her hand. A  prominent publisher of technical magazines in New York took the degree  of Arts in Cornell in his younger days; and more writers of fiction than  you can shake a stick at once labored over civil-engineering plans as  their chosen career. Herbert Hoover is a mining man who best revealed  his capabilities in the field of traffic management--if the work which  he supervised in Belgium may be so termed. Certainly it had to do with  getting materials from where they were plentiful to where they were  scarce, which is roughly the work of the traffic manager.    And so it goes. The young man in this particular must decide for  himself. Actually, there is more of mystery and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#4)"],[1,"and admirable is the story  of Troilus and Briseida, known better to us by her later name of  Cressida. Through Boccaccio's _Il Filostrato_ this tale reached our  English Chaucer, and through Chaucer it gave rise to the strange,  half-heroic, half-satirical play of Shakespeare.    Again, ten years later, an unknown poet was adapting Virgil to the  taste of his contemporaries in his _Eneas_, where the courtship of  the Trojan hero and Lavinia is related in the chivalric manner. All  these poems are composed in the swift octosyllabic verse; the _Troy_  extends to thirty thousand lines. While the names of the personages  are classical, the spirit and life of the romances are wholly  mediaeval: Troilus, and Hector, and AEneas are conceived as if knights  of the Middle Ages; their wars and loves are those of gallant  chevaliers. The _Romance of Julius Caesar_ (in alexandrine verse),  the work of a certain Jacot de Forest, writing in the second half  of the thirteenth century, versifies, with some additions from the  Commentaries of Caesar, an earlier prose translation by Jehan de Thuin  (about 1240) of Lucan's Pharsalia--the oldest translation in prose  of any secular work of antiquity. Caesar's passion for Cleopatra in  the Romance is the love prescribed to good knights by the amorous  code of the writer's day, and Cleopatra herself has borrowed something  of the charm of Tristram's Iseult.    If _Julius Caesar_ may be styled historical, the ROMAN D'ALEXANDRE,  a poem of twenty thousand lines (to the form of which this romance  gave its name--\"alexandrine\" verse), the work of Lambert le Tort and  Alexandre de Bernay, can only be described as legendary. All--or  nearly all--that was written during the Middle Ages in French on the  subject of Alexander may be traced back to Latin versions of a Greek  compilation, perhaps of the first century, ascribed to Callisthenes,  the companion of Alexander on his Asiatic expedition.[5] It is  uncertain how much the _Alexandre_ may owe to a Provencal poem on  the same subject, written in the early years of the twelfth century,  probably by Alberic de Briancon, of which only a short fragment, but  that of high merit, has been preserved. From his birth, and his  education by Aristotle and the enchanter Nectanebus, to the division,  as death approaches, of his empire between his twelve peers, the story  of Alexander is a series of marvellous adventures; the imaginary  wonders of the East, monstrous wild beasts, water-women,  flower-maidens, Amazons, rain of fire, magic mountains, magic  fountains, trees of the sun and of the moon, are introduced with a  liberal hand. The hero is specially distinguished by the virtue of  liberality; a jongleur who charms him by lays sung to the flute, is  rewarded with the lordship of Tarsus, a worthy example for the  twelfth-century patrons of the poet. The romance had a resounding  fame.    [Footnote 5: Not quite all, for certain borrowings were made from  the correspondence of Alexander with Dindimus, King of the Brahmans,  and from the _Alexandri Magni iter ad Paradisum_.]    Of classical poets, Ovid ranked next to Virgil in the esteem of the  Middle Ages. The mythology of paganism was sanctified by the  assumption that it was an allegory of Christian mysteries, and thus  the stories might first be enjoyed by the imagination, and then be  expounded in their spiritual meaning. The _Metamorphoses_ supplied  Chretien de Troyes with the subject of his _Philomena_; other writers  gracefully dealt with the tales of _Piramus_ and of _Narcissus_. But  the most important work founded upon Ovid was a versified translation  of the _Metamorphoses_ (before 1305) by a Franciscan monk, Chretien  Legouais de Sainte-Maure, with appended interpretations, scientific,  historical, moral, or religious, of the mythological fables. Ovid's  _Art of Love_, of which more than one rendering was made, aided in  the formation or development of the mediaeval theory of love and the  amorous casuistry founded upon that theory.      IV  ROMANCES OF LOVE AND COURTESY    Under the general title of the _Epopee courtoise_--the Epopee of  Courtesy--may be grouped those romances which are either works of  pure imagination or of uncertain origin, or which lead us back to  Byzantine or to Celtic sources. They include some of the most  beautiful and original poems of the Middle Ages. Appearing first about  the opening of the twelfth century, later in date than the early  _chansons de geste_, and contemporary with the courtly lyric poetry  of love, they exhibit the chivalric spirit in a refined and graceful  aspect; their marvels are not gross wonders, but often surprises of  beauty; they are bright in colour, and varied in the play of life;  the passions which they interpret, and especially the passion of love,  are felt with an exquisite delicacy and a knowledge of the workings  of the heart. They move lightly in their rhymed or assonanced verse;  even when they passed into the form of prose they retained something  of their charm. Breton harpers wandering through France and England  made Celtic themes known through their _lais_; the fame of King Arthur  was spread abroad by these singers and by the _History_ of Geoffrey  of Monmouth. French poets welcomed the new matter of romance, infused  into it their own chivalric spirit, made it a receptacle for their  ideals of gallantry, courtesy, honour, grace, and added their own  beautiful inventions. With the story of King Arthur was connected  that of the sacred vessel--the graal--in which Joseph of Arimathea  at the cross had received the Saviour's blood. And thus the rude Breton  _lais_ were elevated not only to a chivalric but to a religious  purpose.    The romances of Tristan may certainly be named as of Celtic origin.  About 1150 an Anglo-Norman poet, BEROUL, brought together the  scattered narrative of his adventures in a romance, of which a large  fragment remains. The secret loves of Tristan and Iseut, their  woodland wanderings, their dangers and escapes, are related with fine  imaginative sympathy; but in this version of the tale the fatal  love-philtre operates only for a period of three years; Iseut, with  Tristan's consent, returns to her husband, King Marc; and then a  second passion is born in their hearts, a passion which is the  offspring not of magic but of natural attraction, and at a critical  moment of peril the fragment closes. About twenty years later (1170)  the tale was again sung by an Anglo-Norman named THOMAS. Here--again  in a fragment--we read of Tristan's marriage, a marriage only in name,  to the white-handed Iseut of Brittany, his fidelity of heart to his  one first love, his mortal wound and deep desire to see the Queen  of Cornwall, the device of the white or black sails to announce the  result of his entreaty that she should come, his deception, and the  death of his true love upon her lover's corpse. Early in the thirteenth  century was composed a long prose romance, often rehandled and  expanded, upon the same subject, in which Iseut and Tristan meet at  the last moment and die in a close embrace.    _Le Chevrefeuille_ (The Honeysuckle), one of several _lais_ by a  twelfth-century poetess, MARIE, living in England, but a native of  France, tells gracefully of an assignation of Tristan and Iseut, their  meeting in the forest, and their sorrowful farewell. Marie de France  wrote with an exquisite sense of the generosities and delicacy of  the heart, and with a skill in narrative construction which was rare  among the poets of her time. In _Les Deux Amants_, the manly pride  of passion, which in a trial of strength declines the adventitious  aid of a reviving potion, is rewarded by the union in death of the  lover and his beloved. In _Yonec_ and in _Lanval_ tales of love and  chivalry are made beautiful by lore of fairyland, in which the element  of wonder is subdued to beauty. But the most admirable poem by Marie  de France is unquestionably her _Eliduc_. The Breton knight Eliduc  is passionately loved by Guilliadon, the only daughter of the old  King of Exeter, on whose behalf he had waged battle. Her tokens of  affection, girdle and ring, are received by Eliduc in silence; for,  though her passion is returned, he has left in Brittany, unknown to  Guilliadon, a faithful wife. Very beautiful is the self-transcending  love of the wife, who restores her rival from seeming death, and  herself retires into a convent. The lovers are wedded, and live in  charity to the poor, but with a trouble at the heart for the wrong  that they have done. In the end they part; Eliduc embraces the  religious life, and the two loving women are united as sisters in  the same abbey.    Wace, in his romance of the _Brut_ (1155), which renders into verse  the _Historia_ of Geoffrey of Monmouth, makes the earliest mention  of the Round Table. Whether the Arthurian legends be of Celtic or  of French origin--and the former seems probable--the French romances  of King Arthur owe but the crude material to Celtic sources; they  may be said to begin with CHRETIEN DE TROYES, whose lost poem on  Tristan was composed about 1160. Between that date and 1175 he wrote  his _Erec et Enide_ (a tale known to us through Tennyson's idyll of  Geraint and Enid, derived from the Welsh _Mabinogion_), _Cliges_,  _Le Chevalier de la Charrette_, _Le Chevalier au Lion_, and _Perceval_.  In _Cliges_ the maidenhood of his beloved Fenice, wedded in form to  the Emperor of Constantinople, is guarded by a magic potion; like  Romeo's Juliet, she sleeps in apparent death, but, happier than Juliet,  she recovers from her trance to fly with her lover to the court of  Arthur. The _Chevalier de la Charrette_, at first unknown by name,  is discovered to be Lancelot, who, losing his horse, has condescended,  in order that he may obtain sight of Queen Guenievre, and in passionate  disregard of the conventions of knighthood, to seat himself in a cart  which"]]]
