The  forward gangway was for about an hour occupied by men who did nothing  but pass rifles from the quay to the ship; it was a formidable sight,  this stream of deadly weapons that flowed on board. Up another gangway  enough cordite to blow up the whole of Liverpool was being gingerly  carried in small cases. But this hour or two of embarkation, in which so  much really happened, left little impression on my mind. It simply was  one more illustration of the admirable efficiency of discipline for  which our army is famous. It was when the gangways were removed and the  crowd began to pour on to the stage that the affair became human; and  the half-hour that elapsed between that time and the moment when the  mist finally hid the ship wrote itself much more deeply on my memory.    One gangway was left open, and stragglers and men who at the last moment  had stayed away for an hour with their wives and children were hunted  out and hurried up it. At the shore end there were many painful scenes,  which people with a little imagination may picture for themselves.  Fortunately a farewell is a brief thing, and leaves only aching hearts;  people could not stand a sustained agony like that of the last moment.  It is the price we pay for our powers of memory and forethought; the  charger, going perhaps to a bloody and cruel death, steps willingly  enough up plank; the drunken man sings his good-bye; only the sober and  alert taste the fearful sting of parting. Even the people who had kept  up a great show of callousness had the mask suddenly and for the moment  plucked from their faces; young subalterns with rather watery eyes and  very loud voices ran swiftly up the plank, and brave women who had a  smile even to the last for their husbands turned a different face  shorewards. One could not help contrasting the weight of the burden for  those who went away and those who stayed behind; for the men and for the  women; for those who were going to fight, to die perhaps, but still to  _do_ something, and for those who had nothing but their thoughts to be  busy with. Pessimistic as this view may seem, it is the true one; the  event described as an \"enthusiastic send-off\" is essentially a  melancholy function, and the relief afforded by the antics of a few  intoxicated men does not make it less so. It is strange, indeed, how  important a part is played by the whisky-bottle in the farewells of the  poor. I have seen it passed round family circles at the last moment like  some grotesque sacrament; have even overheard husband and wife almost  quarrelling in their desire to press the comforter each upon the other.  \"Here, take it with you, Sam.\" \"No, Missus, you 'ave it; I can get some  off Tom.\" \"No, lad, take it--I'll throw it after you if you don't.\"  Chance generally stepped in to kill the ghost in the bottle, throwing it  to the ground and spilling the contents. I saw one little boy, aged  about four, run up to his daddy at the last moment with a gorgeous  present in the shape of a glass pistol (a delicate reference to his  profession) full of spirits; it had a cork in the barrel, and I suppose  you fired it down your throat. Amid all these scenes the officers  displayed an unvarying tact, coaxing the men on board and not unduly  hastening their farewells; but for all that there were many violent and  tragic scenes.    Just before the last gangway was run ashore a little woman came up,  crying and almost breathless, and begging to be allowed to say good-bye  to her husband, who was at the other end of the gangway, not allowed to  come down. The orders were absolute--no one must go up to the ship. Then  the woman broke out into a great wailing and sobbing, praying the  quartermaster on her knees that he would let her go half-way up the  gangway; but he was as firm as a rock. Then she came to the edge of the  landing-stage and cried quietly, all alone in that vast crowd, now and  then calling broken words of endearment to the man who stood a dozen  yards away from her across the strip of black water. Discipline is  heavy, and crushes; it is also sharp, and sometimes cuts cruelly and  deeply. But in the midst of her amazing grief she found time to call  some cheering words across to her husband: \"Keep your heart up, lad, and  think of me and the children as loves you.\" He, poor soul, looked  thunder at his sergeant, and raged and swore; but he was a unit in a  mass--he kicked against the pricks, and he knew it.    At last the gangway was removed, and a kind of quietness fell upon the  crowd, waiting for the next harrowing sensation. It came in a  succession of those minute incidents that burn themselves into the  memory of people whose nerves are on the rack. The splash of a hawser  into the dock; the deep notes of the engine-room telegraph, and the  clicking reply upon the bridge; the spinning of the wheel as a  quartermaster tests the steering engine; the clack and spit of winches,  and finally the thrilling shout of the foghorn, whose echo leaves you  trembling--all these things have a painful significance, and they bite  and grip into the heart. As the ship began to move a band on the  shade-deck struck up \"Auld Lang Syne,\" and immediately the floodgates  were unlocked. Tears started again into bitterly dry eyes, handkerchiefs  were waved, people shouted, sang snatches of song--everyone made a sound  of some kind, and contributed to the great unrestrained noise of human  beings in distress and excitement. Above it all rose the hooting of  foghorns and sirens, while the band made its noise too--thump and throb  of drums, scream of pipes, and red-hot flare of brass instruments.  Sea-birds, seeing the ship about to depart, flapped and hovered about it  by the score, adding their shrill cries to the tumult; and high on his  flying-bridge stood the captain, shifting his telegraph from \"stand by\"  to \"ahead,\" holding up or moving his hand, but not uttering his voice.  It was a striking picture, in which he stood as an image of a Fate by  which all men were for the moment helplessly crushed down.    It was at this moment that something happened which I, for one, had been  expecting. One of the many men who were perched in the rigging or  outside the rails lost his hold, and in the same second was wriggling in  the water. It conveys some idea of the pitch to which the crowd was  strung up to say that the noise did not increase and hardly changed its  character. I suppose people turned from cheering to shouting, but the  big sound was still the same, and since the bands-men were high up and  in the middle of the deck they saw and knew nothing and went on playing.  But something else impressed me far more deeply; indeed, I think that I  can never forget it. Quite close to me was standing the man's wife  holding a baby, and as the man's face turned towards us in his  floundering she said calmly, \"God, it's my George.\" And the little boy,  not understanding, repeated gleefully and senselessly, \"It's dadda; it's  dadda.\"    I looked at the woman's face; her cup had been full before; she had  drunk her fill of grief; and this new horror, her husband struggling  like a mouse in the bitter cold water, could not add a pang to her  torture. All that I have described happened, of course, in a few  seconds; the man had barely gone under before one of the ship's  butchers, in his white clothes, was in after him. Let no one belittle  the race of butchers. The life-taker knew how to save life, and Master  Butcher had his man in a moment, turned him on his back, and began to  swim ashore; indeed, there was no fear of the man's drowning, for there  were half a dozen men in the water within half a minute of the accident.  The man was brought ashore, and his wife helped to rub him down; only to  go through her parting again on the deck of a tender a few minutes  afterwards. But there was a cheerier note in the cheering that broke out  when the ship again began to move, and when the band struck up \"God Save  the Queen\" everyone who had a croak in him or her joined with a will.  The shape of the ship grew dim in the mist, but still the sea-birds  cried and hovered like winged prayers and wishes between her and the  shore.           *       *       *       *       *    In the Thames and at Southampton similar scenes were enacted almost  daily. Here is an account of a \"Specimen Day\" at Southampton--one of the  busiest that had been known there since the beginning of the war, for  Lord Roberts's grand army was being hurried out to repair the fortunes  shattered at Magersfontein, Stormberg, and Colenso.    All day long crowded troop-trains had been steaming into the station,  where small pilot engines waited to receive them and drag them, groaning  and squealing, round the curves and across the points that lead to the  docks. The first train arrived at about nine, and the last at two.  Between those hours there was a constant succession of trains. Three  steamers were waiting to receive the troops; the Peninsular and Oriental  liner _Assaye_, the Union Steamship Company's _Goorkha_, and the Castle  liner _Braemar Castle_. The _Assaye_ was a new boat, and this was her  maiden voyage. She carried two regiments, the 2nd Norfolk and the 2nd  Hampshire, and the fact that the Hampshire is the territorial regiment  of the port, accounted for the unusually large crowd that assembled on  the wharf beside which the _Assaye_ lay. The business of despatching  transports had become so commonplace at Southampton that unless there  was some special interest attached to the embarkation there was no crowd  at all. Only the town loafers would assemble in any strength. But many  of the Southampton people had friends in the Hampshire Regiment, so  there were some thousands pressing round the barriers that surrounded  the dock shed into which the trains on arriving were drawn.    It was on board the _Assaye_ that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2388"],[0,"The Song Celestial; Or, Bhagavad-Gîtâ (from the Mahâbhârata) (#4)"],[1,"mirror, as the womb surrounds    The babe unborn, so is the world of things    Foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.    The wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe    It is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,    Fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.    Sense, mind, and reason--these, O Kunti's Son!    Are booty for it; in its play with these    It maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.    Therefore, thou noblest child of Bharata!    Govern thy heart! Constrain th' entangled sense!    Resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps    Knowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong,    But what discerns it stronger, and the mind    Strongest; and high o'er all the ruling Soul.    Wherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,    Put forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!    Fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay    What haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER III. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Karma-Yog,\"    Or \"The Book of Virtue in Work.\"            CHAPTER IV        Krishna.    This deathless Yoga, this deep union,    I taught Vivaswata,[FN#6] the Lord of Light;    Vivaswata to Manu gave it; he    To Ikshwaku; so passed it down the line    Of all my royal Rishis. Then, with years,    The truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince!    Now once again to thee it is declared--    This ancient lore, this mystery supreme--    Seeing I find thee votary and friend.      Arjuna.    Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days,    And bright Vivaswata's preceded time!    How shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest,    \"From the beginning it was I who taught?\"      Krishna.    Manifold the renewals of my birth    Have been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too!    But mine I know, and thine thou knowest not,    O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be    Unborn, undying, indestructible,    The Lord of all things living; not the less--    By Maya, by my magic which I stamp    On floating Nature-forms, the primal vast--    I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness    Declines, O Bharata! when Wickedness    Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take    Visible shape, and move a man with men,    Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back,    And setting Virtue on her seat again.    Who knows the truth touching my births on earth    And my divine work, when he quits the flesh    Puts on its load no more, falls no more down    To earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!    Many there be who come! from fear set free,    From anger, from desire; keeping their hearts    Fixed upon me--my Faithful--purified    By sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these    Mix with my being. Whoso worship me,    Them I exalt; but all men everywhere    Shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls    Which seek reward for works, make sacrifice    Now, to the lower gods. I say to thee    Here have they their reward. But I am He    Made the Four Castes, and portioned them a place    After their qualities and gifts. Yea, I    Created, the Reposeful; I that live    Immortally, made all those mortal births:    For works soil not my essence, being works    Wrought uninvolved.[FN#7] Who knows me acting thus    Unchained by action, action binds not him;    And, so perceiving, all those saints of old    Worked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou    As, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.      Thou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before    By singers and by sages, \"What is act,    And what inaction? \"I will teach thee this,    And, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save    Needs must one rightly meditate those three--    Doing,--not doing,--and undoing. Here    Thorny and dark the path is! He who sees    How action may be rest, rest action--he    Is wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth!    He doeth well, acting or resting. Freed    In all his works from prickings of desire,    Burned clean in act by the white fire of truth,    The wise call that man wise; and such an one,    Renouncing fruit of deeds, always content.    Always self-satisfying, if he works,    Doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,    Which--quit of fear and hope--subduing self--    Rejecting outward impulse--yielding up    To body's need nothing save body, dwells    Sinless amid all sin, with equal calm    Taking what may befall, by grief unmoved,    Unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same    In good and evil fortunes; nowise bound    By bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,    Whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,    Whose heart is set on truth--of such an one    What work he does is work of sacrifice,    Which passeth purely into ash and smoke    Consumed upon the altar! All's then God!    The sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain    Are Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats    Is Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he    Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm.    Some votaries there be who serve the gods    With flesh and altar-smoke; but other some    Who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite    With will of worship. Of the which be they    Who, in white flame of continence, consume    Joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,    Forgoing tender speech and sound of song:    And they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,    Burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss    Of youth and love, renouncing happiness:    And they who lay for offering there their wealth,    Their penance, meditation, piety,    Their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore    Painfully gained with long austerities:    And they who, making silent sacrifice,    Draw in their breath to feed the flame of thought,    And breathe it forth to waft the heart on high,    Governing the ventage of each entering air    Lest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:    And they who, day by day denying needs,    Lay life itself upon the altar-flame,    Burning the body wan. Lo! all these keep    The rite of offering, as if they slew    Victims; and all thereby efface much sin.    Yea! and who feed on the immortal food    Left of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,    To The Unending. But for him that makes    No sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot    Even in the present world. How should he share    Another, O thou Glory of thy Line?      In sight of Brahma all these offerings    Are spread and are accepted! Comprehend    That all proceed by act; for knowing this,    Thou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice    Which Knowledge pays is better than great gifts    Offered by wealth, since gifts' worth--O my Prince!    Lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:    And these are gained by reverence, by strong search,    By humble heed of those who see the Truth    And teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more    Will ache with error, for the Truth shall show    All things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.    Moreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst    Of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth    Should bear thee safe and dry across the sea    Of thy transgressions. As the kindled flame    Feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash,    So unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought    The flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away!    There is no purifier like thereto    In all this world, and he who seeketh it    Shall find it--being grown perfect--in himself.    Believing, he receives it when the soul    Masters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes--    Possessing knowledge--to the higher peace,    The uttermost repose. But those untaught,    And those without full faith, and those who fear    Are shent; no peace is here or other where,    No hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.    He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt,    Disparting self from service, soul from works,    Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince!    Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain    With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!    This doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond    Born of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!    Give thyself to the field with me! Arise!      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Jnana Yog,\"    Or \"The Book of the Religion of Knowledge,\"            CHAPTER V        Arjuna.    Yet, Krishna! at the one time thou dost laud    Surcease of works, and, at another time,    Service through work. Of these twain plainly tell    Which is the better way?      Krishna.    To cease from works    Is well, and to do works in holiness    Is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme;    But of these twain the better way is his    Who working piously refraineth not.      That is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed,    Who--seeking nought, rejecting nought--dwells proof    Against the \"opposites.\"[FN#8] O valiant Prince!    In doing, such breaks lightly from all deed:    'Tis the new scholar talks as they were two,    This Sankhya and this Yoga: wise men know    Who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both!    The region of high rest which Sankhyans reach    Yogins attain. Who sees these twain as one    Sees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief!    Is hard to win without much holiness.    Whoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled,    Pure-hearted, lord of senses and of self,    Lost in the common life of all which lives--    A \"Yogayukt\"--he is a Saint who wends    Straightway to Brahm. Such an one is not touched    By taint of deeds. \"Nought of myself I do!\"    Thus will he think-who holds the truth of truths--    In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when    He eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks,    Holds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts;    Always assured \"This is the sense-world plays    With senses.\"He that acts in thought of Brahm,    Detaching end from act, with act content,    The world of sense can no more stain his soul    Than waters mar th' enamelled lotus-leaf.    With life, with heart, with mind,-nay, with the help    Of all five senses--letting selfhood go--    Yogins toil ever towards their souls' release.    Such votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds,    Gain endless peace:"]]]
