Just a  little way off was a little heap of snow.    \"I don't remember that,\" said Danny. \"And I don't remember  anything that would make that. There isn't any little bush or old  log or anything underneath it. Perhaps rough Brother North Wind  heaped it up, just for fun.\"    But all the time Danny Meadow Mouse kept studying and studying  that little heap of snow. Pretty soon he saw rough Brother North  Wind coming his way and tossing the snow about as he came. He  caught a handful from the top of the little heap of snow that  Danny was studying, and when he had passed, Danny's sharp eyes  saw something red there. It was just the color of the cloak old  Granny Fox wears.        \"_Granny Fox, you can't fool me!      I see you plain as plain can be!_\"    shouted Danny Meadow Mouse and dropped down out of sight, while  old Granny Fox shook the snow from her red cloak and, with a  snarl of disappointment and anger, slowly started for the Green  Forest, where Reddy Fox was waiting for her.    [Illustration]                                       IX                Danny Meadow Mouse Is Caught at Last          \"_Tippy-toppy-tippy-toe,      Play and frolic in the snow!      Now you see me! Now you don't!      Think you'll catch me, but you won't!      Tippy-toppy-tippy-toe,      Oh, such fun to play in snow!_\"    Danny Meadow Mouse sang this, or at least he tried to sing it, as  he skipped about on the snow that covered the Green Meadows. But  Danny Meadow Mouse has such a little voice, such a funny little  squeaky voice, that had you been there you probably would never  have guessed that he was singing. He thought he was, though, and  was enjoying it just as much as if he had the most beautiful  voice in the world. You know, singing is nothing in the world but  happiness in the heart making itself heard.    Oh, yes, Danny Meadow Mouse was happy! Why shouldn't he have  been? Hadn't he proved himself smarter than old Granny Fox? That  is something to make anyone happy. Some folks may fool Granny Fox  once; some may fool her twice; but there are very few who can  keep right on fooling her until she gives up in disgust. That is  just what Danny Meadow Mouse had done, and he felt very smart and  of course he felt very happy.    So Danny sang his little song and skipped about in the moonlight,  and dodged in and out of his little round doorways, and all the  time kept his sharp little eyes open for any sign of Granny Fox  or Reddy Fox. But with all his smartness, Danny forgot. Yes, Sir,  Danny forgot one thing. He forgot to watch up in the sky. He knew  that of course old Roughleg the Hawk was asleep, so he had  nothing to fear from him. But he never once thought of Hooty the  Owl.    Dear me, dear me! Forgetting is a dreadful habit. If nobody ever  forgot, there wouldn't be nearly so much trouble in the world.  No, indeed, there wouldn't be nearly so much trouble. And Danny  Meadow Mouse forgot. He skipped and sang and was happy as could  be, and never once thought to watch up in the sky.    [Illustration: _Over in the Green Forest Hooty the Owl had had  poor hunting_]    Over in the Green Forest Hooty the Owl had had poor hunting, and  he was feeling cross. You see, Hooty was hungry, and hunger is  apt to make one feel cross. The longer he hunted, the hungrier  and crosser he grew. Suddenly he thought of Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"I suppose he is asleep somewhere safe and snug under the snow,\"  grumbled Hooty, \"but he might, he just might, be out for a frolic  in the moonlight. I believe I'll go down on the meadows and see.\"    Now Hooty the Owl can fly without making the teeniest, weeniest  sound. It seems as if he just drifts along through the air like a  great shadow. Now he spread his great wings and floated out over  the meadows. You know Hooty can see as well at night as most  folks can by day, and it was not long before he saw Danny Meadow  Mouse skipping about on the snow and dodging in and out of his  little round doorways. Hooty's great eyes grew brighter and  fiercer. Without a sound he floated through the moonlight until  he was just over Danny Meadow Mouse.    Too late Danny looked up. His little song ended in a tiny squeak  of fear, and he started for his nearest little round doorway.  Hooty the Owl reached down with his long cruel claws and--Danny  Meadow Mouse was caught at last!                                        X                   A Strange Ride and How It Ended      Danny Meadow Mouse often had sat watching Skimmer the Swallow  sailing around up in the blue, blue sky. He had watched Ol'  Mistah Buzzard go up, up, up, until he was nothing but a tiny  speck, and Danny had wondered how it would seem to be way up  above the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and look down. It  had seemed to him that it must be very wonderful and beautiful.  Sometimes he had wished that he had wings and could go up in the  air and look down. And now here he was, he, Danny Meadow Mouse,  actually doing that very thing!    But Danny could see nothing wonderful or beautiful now. No,  indeed! Everything was terrible, for you see, Danny Meadow Mouse  wasn't flying himself. He was being carried. Yes, Sir, Danny  Meadow Mouse was being carried through the air in the cruel claws  of Hooty the Owl! And all because Danny had forgotten--forgotten  to watch up in the sky for danger.    [Illustration: _Danny was being carried through the air in the  cruel claws of Hooty the Owl!_]    Poor, poor Danny Meadow Mouse! Hooty's great cruel claws hurt him  dreadfully! But it wasn't the pain that was the worst. No,  indeed! It wasn't the pain! It was the thought of what would  happen when Hooty reached his home in the Green Forest, for he  knew that there Hooty would gobble him up, bones and all. As he  flew, Hooty kept chuckling, and Danny Meadow Mouse knew just what  those chuckles meant. They meant that Hooty was thinking of the  good meal he was going to have.    Hanging there in Hooty's great cruel claws, Danny looked down on  the snow-covered Green Meadows he loved so well. They seemed a  frightfully long way below him, though really they were not far  at all, for Hooty was flying very low. But Danny Meadow Mouse had  never in all his life been so high up before, and so it seemed to  him that he was way, way up in the sky, and he shut his eyes so  as not to see. But he couldn't keep them shut. No, Sir, he  couldn't keep them shut! He just had to keep opening them. There  was the dear old Green Forest drawing nearer and nearer. It  always had looked very beautiful to Danny Meadow Mouse, but now  it looked terrible, very terrible indeed, because over in it,  hidden away there in some dark place, was the home of Hooty the  Owl.    Just ahead of him was the Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit  lives so safely. Every old bramble in it was covered with snow  and it was very, very beautiful. Really everything was just as  beautiful as ever--the moonlight, the Green Forest, the  snow-covered Green Meadows, the Old Briar-patch. The only change  was in Danny Meadow Mouse himself, and it was all because he had  forgotten.    Suddenly Danny began to wriggle and struggle. \"Keep still!\"  snapped Hooty the Owl.    But Danny only struggled harder than ever. It seemed to him that  Hooty wasn't holding him as tightly as at first. He felt one of  Hooty's claws slip. It tore his coat and hurt dreadfully, but it  slipped! The fact is, Hooty had only grabbed Danny Meadow Mouse  by the loose part of his coat, and up in the air he couldn't get  hold of Danny any better. Danny kicked, squirmed, and twisted,  and twisted, squirmed, and kicked. He felt his coat tear and of  course the skin with it, but he kept right on, for now he was  hanging almost free. Hooty had started down now, so as to get a  better hold. Danny gave one more kick and then--he felt himself  falling!    Danny Meadow Mouse shut his eyes and held his breath. Down, down,  down he fell. It seemed to him that he never would strike the  snow-covered meadows! Really he fell only a very little distance.  But it seemed a terrible distance to Danny. He hit something that  scratched him, and then--plump!--he landed in the soft snow right  in the very middle of the Old Briar-patch, and the last thing he  remembered was hearing the scream of disappointment and rage of  Hooty the Owl.    [Illustration]                                       XI                     Peter Rabbit Gets a Fright      Peter Rabbit sat in his favorite place in the middle of the dear  Old Briar-patch, trying to decide which way he would go on his  travels that night. The night before he had had a narrow escape  from old Granny Fox over in the Green Forest. There was nothing  to eat around the Smiling Pool and no one to talk to there any  more, and you know that Peter must either eat or ask questions in  order to be perfectly happy. No, the Smiling Pool was too dull a  place to interest Peter on such a beautiful moonlight night, and  Peter had no mind to try his legs against those of old Granny Fox  again in the Green Forest.    Early that morning, just after Peter had settled down for his  morning nap, Tommy Tit the Chickadee had dropped into the dear  Old Briar-patch just to be neighborly. Peter was just dozing off  when he heard the cheeriest little voice in the world. It was  saying:        \"_Dee-dee-chickadee!      I see you! Can you see me?_\"    Peter began to smile even before he could get his eyes open and  look up. There, right over his head, was Tommy Tit hanging head  down from a nodding old bramble. In a twinkling he was down on  the snow right in front of Peter, then up in the brambles again,  right side up, upside down, here, there, everywhere, never still  a minute, and all the time chattering away in the cheeriest  little voice in the world:        \"_Dee-dee-chickadee!      I'm as happy as can be!

I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving;        But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away.      Oh, it's cruel, dearie, cruel, and it's God knows how I'm grieving;        But His Loneliness is calling and He knows I must obey.          THE SONG OF THE WAGE-SLAVE          When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,      I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.      And I hope that it won't be heaven, with some of the parsons I've met--      All I want is just quiet, just to rest and forget.      Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands;      Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands--      Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich;      I've done their desire for a daily hire, and I die like a dog in a            ditch.      I have used the strength Thou hast given, Thou knowest I did not shirk;      Threescore years of labour--Thine be the long day's work.      And now, Big Master, I'm broken and bent and twisted and scarred,      But I've held my job, and Thou knowest, and Thou wilt not judge me            hard.      Thou knowest my sins are many, and often I've played the fool--      Whiskey and cards and women, they made me the devil's tool.      I was just like a child with money: I flung it away with a curse,      Feasting a fawning parasite, or glutting a harlot's purse,      Then back to the woods repentant, back to the mill or the mine,      I, the worker of workers, everything in my line.      Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),      A brute with brute strength to labour, doing as I was bid;      Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;      Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.      A brute with brute strength to labour, and they were so far above--      Yet I'd gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love.      I with the strength of two men, savage and shy and wild--      Yet how I'd ha' treasured a woman, and the sweet, warm kiss of a child.      Well, 'tis Thy world, and Thou knowest. I blaspheme and my ways be            rude;      But I've lived my life as I found it, and I've done my best to be good;      I, the primitive toiler, half naked, and grimed to the eyes,      Sweating it deep in their ditches, swining it stark in their styes,      Hulling down forests before me, spanning tumultuous streams;      Down in the ditch building o'er me palaces fairer than dreams;      Boring the rock to the ore-bed, driving the road through the fen,      Resolute, dumb, uncomplaining, a man in a world of men.      Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;      Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.      Master, I've done Thy bidding, and the light is low in the west,      And the long, long shift is over ... Master, I've earned it--Rest.          GRIN          If you're up against a bruiser and you're getting knocked about--                                                              Grin.      If you're feeling pretty groggy, and you're licked beyond a doubt--                                                              Grin.      Don't let him see you're funking, let him know with every clout,      Though your face is battered to a pulp, your blooming heart is stout;      Just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out--                                                              And grin.        This life's a bally battle, and the same advice holds true,                                                              Of grin.      If you're up against it badly, then it's only one on you,                                                              So grin.      If the future's black as thunder, don't let people see you're blue;      Just cultivate a cast-iron smile of joy the whole day through;      If they call you \"Little Sunshine,\" wish that _they'd_ no troubles,            too--                                                              You may--grin.        Rise up in the morning with the will that, smooth or rough,                                                              You'll grin.      Sink to sleep at midnight, and although you're feeling tough,                                                              Yet grin.      There's nothing gained by whining, and you're not that kind of stuff;      You're a fighter from away back, and you _won't_ take a rebuff;      Your trouble is that you don't know when you have had enough--                                                              Don't give in.      If Fate should down you, just get up and take another cuff;      You may bank on it that there is no philosophy like bluff                                                              And grin.          THE SHOOTING OF DAN MCGREW          A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;      The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;      Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,      And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known            as Lou.        When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and            the glare,      There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty and loaded            for bear.      He looked like a man with a foot in the grave, and scarcely the            strength of a louse,      Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar, and he called for drinks            for the house.      There was none could place the stranger's face, though we searched            ourselves for a clue;      But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan            McGrew.        There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, and hold them hard            like a spell;      And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;      With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done,      As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one            by one.      Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd do,      And I turned my head--and there watching him was the lady that's            known as Lou.        His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of            daze,      Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze.      The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the            stool,      So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like            a fool.      In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him            sway;      Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands--my God! but that man            could play!        Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful clear,      And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could            _hear_;      With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the cold,      A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad for the muck            called gold;      While high overhead, green, yellow, and red, the North Lights swept            in bars--      Then you've a haunch what the music meant ... hunger and night and            the stars.        And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans;      But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;      For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof            above;      But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love;      A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true--      (God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge,--the lady that's            known as Lou.)        Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce could hear;      But you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it            once held dear;      That some one had stolen the woman you loved; that her love was a            devil's lie;      That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl away and            die.      'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair, and it thrilled you            through and through--      \"I guess I'll make it a spread misere,\" said Dangerous Dan McGrew.        The music almost died away ... then it burst like a pent-up flood;      And it seemed to say, \"Repay, repay,\" and my eyes were blind with            blood.      The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a            frozen lash,      And the lust awoke to kill, to kill ... then the music stopped with            a crash,        And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar            way;      In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him            sway;      Then his lips went in in a kind of grin, and he spoke, and his voice            was calm;      And, \"Boys,\" says he, \"you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;      But I want to state, and my words are straight, and I'll bet my poke            they're true,      That one of you is a hound of hell ... and that one is Dan McGrew.\"        Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out, and two guns blazed            in the dark;      And a woman screamed, and the lights went up, and two men lay stiff            and stark;      Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,      While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady            that's known as Lou.        These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know;      They say that the stranger was crazed with \"hooch,\" and I'm not"]]]
