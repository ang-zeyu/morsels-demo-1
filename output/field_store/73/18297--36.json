Mr. Duff himself records the discovery  recently of a copy of Caxton's 'Speculum,' 'amongst some rubbish in the  offices of a solicitor at Birkenhead.'    What a vast number of books there is, also, of which only one copy is  known to exist. Of the early editions of Shakespeare's plays alone, more  than a dozen are known by solitary examples. Of such books Hazlitt  remarks that he 'has met in the course of a lengthened career with  treasures which would make a small library, and has beheld no  duplicates.' Probably many of these _incognita_ and _rarissima_ perished  in the great fire of London; others again met their fate solely through  their own popularity, being 'thumbed' to pieces. In 1494 Pynson thought  well enough to reprint Caxton's 'Book of Good Manners'; but of this once  popular book one copy only--that which was formerly in the Amherst  Library--now survives.    Then there is that ancient romance of European popularity 'The four Sons  of Aymon.' One of the great cycle of Charlemagne romances, such was its  popularity that by the end of the thirteenth century it had penetrated  even to Iceland. Many and various were the editions that issued from the  early presses. Caxton printed it about 1489, but of this thick quarto  impression one imperfect copy only has survived. A second edition, as we  learn from the colophon of the third edition, was 'imprinted at London by  Wynken de Worde, the viii daye of Maye, and the year of our lorde  M.CCCCC. iiii'; but a solitary leaf, discovered in the binding of an  ancient book, is the sole representative of an edition that ran probably  into several hundreds.    In the case of some at least of these early books there is another reason  for their disappearance and scarcity. Stephen Vaughan, the indefatigable  agent of Mr. Secretary Cromwell, writing to his master from Antwerp,  mentions that he is 'muche desirous t'atteyne the knowlage of the Frenche  tonge,' but that he is unable to obtain a copy of the only primer which  he knows to exist. This volume, called 'L'Esclarcissement de la Langue  Francoyse,' was 'compose par Maistre Jehan Palsgraue, Angloys, natyf de  Londres et gradue de Paris,' and was printed by Pynson, though it was  finished and published by Hawkins in 1530.    Palsgrave, the author, seems to have been determined that his book should  not fall into the hands of other teachers of French (he was 'scolemaster'  to the Princess Mary, sister of Henry VIII., in 1513, at a stipend of L6  13s. 4d.); and although Vaughan writes that he 'made not a letle labour  to Mr. Palsgrave to have one of his books,' yet 'in no wise he wolde  graunt for no price.' So Vaughan entreats Thomas Cromwell to obtain a  copy for him, 'not doubtyng but though he unkyndly denyd me one, he will  not denye youe one.'    Apparently Palsgrave had entered into some kind of arrangement with the  printer, for Vaughan writes that he 'hathe willed Pynson to sell none of  them to any other person than to suche as he shall comaunde to have them,  lest his proffit by teching the Frenche tonge myght be mynished by the  sale of the same to suche persons as, besids hym, wern disposed to studye  the sayd tongue.'    From this premise it is easy to understand why 'L'Esclarcissement' is  such a rare book. Very few copies indeed are known to exist. Yet one  cannot help wondering what became of the copies that had not been  disposed of at the author's death. Possibly a very small number was  printed, and perhaps 'Johan Haukyns,' faithful to his pact, destroyed  those on hand. That the book was in high esteem may be gathered from the  fact that, in spite of his rebuff, Vaughan says: 'If I had one, I wolde  no less exteme it then a Jewell.' The letter ends with a delightful burst  of ingenuousness. 'Syr, I remember Mr. Palsgrave gave youe one of his  books, which if it please you to geve me I wer muche bounde to youe.'  Whether he obtained a copy in the end history does not relate; but if our  book-hunter is ever so fortunate as to come across one, like Vaughan he  will certainly 'no less exteme it then a Jewell.'    Very many, indeed the vast majority, of the popular jest-books which  appeared in such numbers during Queen Elizabeth's reign are now lost to  us. Some are known by later quotation of their titles, others by later  editions, such as 'The Life of Long Meg of Westminster,' 'A Lytle and  Bryefe Treatyse called the Defence of Women,'[5] etc. But these were  small volumes of few pages, and were doubtless considered as little  worthy of preservation as is the modern 'penny dreadful.' 'But, when we  consider how very many of these early books have come down to our time  only in single copies or even fragments out of an edition of some  hundreds, it is only natural to suppose that a great number must have  utterly disappeared.'[6]    It is not for want of enterprise that so many of these books have not so  far been recovered. The smaller and more remote towns, even villages, of  these islands and the Continent have been, and are being, ransacked by  dealers as well as collectors. The number of works hitherto undescribed  that has been brought to light during the last sixty years must be  considerable; and one still hears every now and then of some rich trover  that has been unearthed. In 1887 a small octavo manuscript volume, in a  worn brown binding, was offered at the end of a sale at Sotheby's. It had  stood, for how long no man knows, on the shelf of a small parish library  in Suffolk; and it was offered for sale 'presumably as being unreadable  to country folk, and capable of being turned into hard cash wherewith a  few works of fiction might be purchased.' Acquired by the Bodleian  Library for L6, it proved, by perhaps one of the most romantic chains of  evidence ever attached to a book,[7] to be the favourite devotional  volume and constant companion of Saint Margaret, Queen of Scotland, who  died in 1093. It was not until 1905 that the original quarto edition  (1594) of Shakespeare's 'Titus Andronicus' was known to exist, when a  copy was discovered and sold for L2000.    Books travel far afield. At the dissolution of the monasteries the rich  libraries that many of them possessed were scattered far and wide. One of  these religious houses was famed for its rich store of books; and that  the report was not exaggerated we know from its ancient library  catalogue, still extant. In this case some of the books were taken by the  inmates with them into exile in Flanders; and when the small community  migrated thence to Portugal, the precious tomes were carried reverently  with them. A fire at their convent in 1651 destroyed a large number of  the volumes, and when some of the nuns returned to England in 1809 they  brought the remaining books with them. Some were sold, but three cases of  these ancient books were sent back to the nuns who stayed behind in  Portugal, and of these cases two were lost in transit.    London, however, has always been the centre of book production in this  country, and it is there that any existing copies of these forgotten  books are most likely to re-appear. Was not a priceless manuscript, a  Household Book of the Black Prince, discovered only a few years ago in  the office of a city lawyer? Once, in the course of his rambles by the  bookstalls of the Farringdon Road,[8] our book-hunter caught a glimpse of  an old box almost covered by books and prints on one of the stalls. Being  unearthed, it proved to be a veritable gem of a trunk, about two feet by  one, and nine inches deep. It had a convex lid, and was covered with  shaggy horsehide, bound with heavily studded leather. The proprietor  stated that he had found it in a cellar, full of old books, most of which  had already been sold (his listener promptly pictured Caxtons among  them); and he was amused to think that any one could be so foolish as to  offer him two shillings for such a dirty old box. However, it was carried  home in triumph, regardless of the great interest shown by  fellow-travellers in the train. A year or two ago the same vender  produced a similar trunk, rather larger, which was full of ancient deeds  relating to property in Clerkenwell. These he sold for a shilling or two  shillings apiece, according to size and seals. The box was larger than  our bookman wanted, but apparently it soon found a purchaser.    Surely such instances must be common in this great city, and many a trunk  must yet linger in cellars and attics in the old parts of the town. Not  many years ago our book-hunter chanced to visit an ancient house at the  end of a small court off Fleet Street. Inside, it seemed to be entirely  lined with oak planking, and it was occupied, or at least that part into  which he penetrated was, by a printer in a small way of business. The  staircase was magnificent, of massive coal-black oak; and when our  book-hunter remarked upon it, the printer informed him he had discovered  that the house had once been the town residence of a famous bishop of  Tudor times.[9] How the occupant discovered this fact our bookman does  not remember; possibly the house is well known to antiquaries, and the  occupier may have read about it or have been told by the previous tenant.  But it is also within the bounds of possibility that he unearthed some  deed or papers relating to the premises. It is strange, too, that one of  the few letters of this bishop which have been preserved refers to books.  'Ye promised unto me, long agone,' he writes to Secretary Cromwell, 'the  Triumphes of Petrarche in the Ytalion tonge. I hartely pray you at this  tyme by this beyrer, . . . to sende me the said Boke with some other at  your deuotion; and especially, if it please you, the boke called  Cortigiano in Ytalion.'[10]    There must be many such houses still extant in London, and who knows what  there may be in their long-disused attics? Hidden away in the darkness "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22718"],[0,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"Cathedral cities of the  Mediterranean were seats of Bishoprics, we cannot now see all the  successive steps of the church architecture of the South. The main era  of the buildings which have come down to us, is the XI-XIV centuries. Of  earlier types and stages little is known, little remains.    [Illustration: A NAVE OF THE EARLIER STYLE.--ARLES.]    In general, Gallic churches are supposed to have been basilican, with  all the poverty of the older style. Charlemagne's architects, with San  Vitale in mind, gave a slight impetus in the far-away chapel at  Aix-la-Chapelle, and Gregory of Tours tells us that Bishop Perpetuus  built a \"glorious\" church at Tours. But his description is meagre. After  a few mathematical details, he returns to things closer to his  heart,--the Church's atmosphere of holiness, the emblematic radiance of  the candle's light, the ecstasy of worshippers who seemed \"to breathe  the air of Paradise.\" And Saint Gregory's is the religious, uncritical  spirit of his day, whose interest was in ecclesiastical establishment  rather than ecclesiastical architecture. Churches there were in numbers;  but they were not architectural achievements. Their building was like  the planting of the flag; they were new outposts, signs of an advance of  the Faith. With this missionary spirit in the Church, with priests still  engaged in christianising and monks in establishing themselves on their  domains, with a very general ignorance of art, with the absorbing  interest of the powerful and great in warfare, and the very great  struggle among the poor for existence, architecture before the X century  had few students or protectors. France had neither sufficient political  peace nor ecclesiastical wealth for elaborate church structures. No  head, either of Church or State, had taste and time enough to inaugurate  such works.    Many causes have combined to destroy such churches as then existed. If  they escaped the rasings and fires of a siege, they were often destroyed  by lightning, or decayed by years; and some of the fragments which  endured to the XIII century were torn down to make room for more  beautiful buildings.    It was the XI and XII centuries which saw the important beginnings of  the great Cathedrals of both North and South. These were the years when  religion was the dominant idea of the western world,--when everything,  even warfare, was pressed into its service. Instead of devastating their  own and their neighbour's country, Christian armies were devastating the  Holy Land; doing to the Infidel in the name of their religion what he,  in the name of his, had formerly done to them. The capture of Jerusalem  had triumphantly ended the First Crusade; the Church was everywhere  victorious, and the Pope in actual fact the mightiest monarch of the  earth. These were the days when Peter the Hermit's cry, \"God wills it,\"  aroused the world, and aroused it to the most diverse accomplishments.    One form of this activity was church building; but there were other  causes than religion for the general magnificence of the effort. Among  these was communal pride, the interesting, half-forgotten motive of much  that is great in mediaeval building.    The Mediaevalism of the old writers seems an endless pageant, in which  indefinitely gorgeous armies \"march up the hill and then march down  again;\" in newer histories this has disappeared in the long struggle of  one class with another; and in neither do we reach the individual, nor  see the daily life of the people who are the backbone of a nation. Yet  these are the people we must know if we are to have a right conception  of the Cathedral's place in the living interest of the Middle Ages. For  the Bishop's church was in every sense a popular church. The Abbey was  built primarily for its monks, and the Abbey-church for their meditation  and worship. The French Cathedral was the people's, it was built by  their money, not money from an Abbey-coffer. It did not stand, as the  Cathedral of England, majestic and apart, in a scholarly close; it was  in the open square of the city; markets and fairs were held about it;  the doors to its calm and rest opened directly on the busiest, every-day  bustle. It is not a mere architectural relic, as its building was never  a mere architectural feat. It is the symbol of a past stage of life, a  majestic part of the picture we conjure before our mind's eye, when we  consider Mediaevalism.    [Illustration: A NAVE OF THE LATER STYLE.--RODEZ.]    Such a picture of a city of another country and of the late Middle Ages  exists in the drama of Richard Wagner's Meistersinger; and his Nuremberg  of the XVI century, with changes of local colour, is the type of all  mediaeval towns. General travel was unknown. The activity of the great  roads was the march of armies, the roving of marauders, the journeys of  venturesome merchants or well-armed knights. Not only roads, but even  streets were unsafe at night; and after the sun had set he who had gone  about freely and carelessly during the day, remained at home or ventured  out with much caution. When armies camped about her walls, the city was  doubtless much occupied with outside happenings. But when the camp broke  up and war was far away, her shoemaker made his shoes, her goldsmith,  fine chains and trinkets, her merchants traded in the market-place.  Their interests were in street brawls, romancings, new \"privileges,\" the  work or the feast of the day--in a word town-topics. Yet being as other  men, the burghers also were awakened by the energy of the age, and  instead of wasting it in adventures and wars, their interest took the  form of an intense local pride, narrow, but with elements of grandeur,  seldom selfish, but civic.    This absence of the personal element is nowhere better illustrated than  in Cathedral building. Of all the really great men who planned the  Cathedrals of France, almost nothing is known; and by searching, little  can be found out. Who can give a dead date, much less a living fact,  concerning the life of that Gervais who conceived the great Gothic  height of Narbonne? Who can tell even the name of him who planned the  sombre, battlemented walls of Agde, or of that great man who first saw  in poetic vision the delicate choir of Saint-Nazaire in Carcassonne?  Artists have a well-preserved personality,--cathedral-builders, none.  Robert of Luzarches who conceived the \"Parthenon of all Gothic  architecture,\" and the man who planned stately Sens and the richness of  Canterbury, are as unknown to us as the quarries from which the stones  of their Cathedrals were cut. It is not the Cathedral built by Robert of  Luzarches belonging to Amiens, as it is the Assumption by Rubens  belonging to Antwerp. It is scarcely the Cathedral of its patron, Saint  Firmin. It is the Cathedral of Amiens.    [Illustration: \"THE DELICATE CHOIR OF SAINT-NAZAIRE.\"--CARCASSONNE.]    We hear many learned disquisitions on the decay of the art of church  building. Lack of time in our rushing age, lack of patience, decline of  religious zeal, or change in belief, these are some of the popular  reasons for this architectural degeneracy. Strange as it may seem none  of these have had so powerful an influence as the invention of printing.  The first printing-press was made in the middle of the XV  century,--after the conception of the great Cathedrals. In an earlier  age, when the greatest could neither read nor write and manuscripts even  in monasteries were rare, sculpture and carving were the layman's books,  and Cathedrals were not only places of worship, they were the  people's religious libraries where literature was cut in stone.    In the North, the most unique form of this literature was the drama of  the Breton Calvaries, which portrayed one subject and one only,--the  \"Life and Passion of Christ,\" taken from Prophecy, Tradition, and the  Gospels. Cathedrals, both North and South, used the narrative form. They  told story after story; and their makers showed an intimate knowledge of  Biblical lore that would do credit to the most ardent theological  student. At Nimes, by no means the richest church in carvings, there are  besides the Last Judgment and the reward of the Evil and the  Righteous,--which even a superficial Christian should know,--many of the  stories of the Book of Genesis. At Arles, there is the Dream of Jacob,  the Dream of Joseph, the Annunciation, the Nativity, Purification,  Massacre of the Innocents, the Flight into Egypt; almost a Bible in  stone. In these days of books and haste few would take the trouble to  study such sculptured tales. But their importance to the unlettered  people of the Middle Ages cannot be overestimated; and the incentive to  magnificence of artistic conception was correspondingly great.    The main era of Cathedral building is the same all over France. But with  the general date, all arbitrary parallel between North and South  abruptly ends. The North began the evolution of the Gothic, a new form  indigenous to its soil; the South continued the Romanesque, her  evolution of a transplanted style, and long knew no other. She had grown  accustomed to give northward,--not to receive; and it was the reign of  Saint Louis before she began to assimilate the architectural ideas of  the Isle de France and to build in the Gothic style, it was admiration  for the newer ideals which led the builders of the South to change such  of their plans as were not already carried out, and to try with these  foreign and beautiful additions, to give to their churches the most  perfect form they could conceive.    And thus, from a web of Fate, in which, as in all destinies, is the  spinning of many threads, came the Cathedrals and Cloisters of the  South. Are they greater than those of the North? Are they inferior to  them? It is best said, \"Comparison is idle.\" Who shall decide between  the fir-trees and the olives--between the beautiful order"]]]
