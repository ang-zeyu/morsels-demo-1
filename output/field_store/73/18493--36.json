The outside  will tell you whether he is neat, orderly and artistic, or whether he  cares nothing for the elements of beauty and neatness. If you go into  his parlor, you can judge whether he cares most for show or for  comfort. His library will reveal to you the character of his mind, and  the dining-room will indicate by its furnishings and its viands  whether he loves the pleasures of sense more than health of body. You  do not need to see the man to have a pretty clear idea of him.    So the body is our house, and our individuality permeates every part  of it. Those who look at our bodily dwelling can gain a very good  idea of what we are. The external appearance will indicate to a great  extent our character. We glance at one man and say, \"He is gross,  sensual, cruel, domineering;\" at another and say, \"He is intellectual,  spiritual, fine-grained, benevolent.\" So we judge of entire strangers,  and usually find the character largely corresponds to our judgment,  if, later, we come to know the person.    The anatomist and microscopist who penetrates into the secrets of his  bodily house after the inhabitant has moved out can tell much of his  habits, his thoughts, his capacities and powers by the traces of  himself which he has left on the insensate walls of his dwelling. The  care of the body, then, adds to our value, because it gives us a  better instrument, a better medium of expression.    The old saying, \"A workman is known by his tools,\" is equally true of  the body. The carpenter who cares for his saws, chisels and planes,  who keeps them sharp and free from rust, will be able to do better  work than the one who carelessly allows them to become nicked, broken,  handleless or rusted. The finer the work which one does, the greater  the care he must take of the instruments with which he works. A  jack-knife will do to whittle a pine stick, but the carver of  intricate designs must have his various sharp tools with which to make  the delicate lines and tracings.    When we speak of health and physical conditions in discussing the  question of your value, we are discussing the instrument upon whose  integrity depends your ability to demonstrate your value.    Many young people think it nonsense to pay attention to the  preservation of health. I have heard them say, \"O, I don't want to be  so fussy! It will do for old folks to be coddling themselves, but I  want a good time. I'd rather die ten years sooner and have some fun  while I do live.\"    I wonder what these same young people would think if they should hear  a workman say, \"Well, I have here a fine kit of tools; I am assured  that if they are destroyed they will never be replaced; but now, while  I am learning my trade, I don't want to be 'so fussy' about keeping  them in order. It will do for 'boss workmen' to take care of  everything so constantly, but now I want to break stones with these  delicate hammers, to cut nails with these razor-bladed knives, to  crack nuts with these slender pincers. By and by, when I am older,  I'll use them as they should be used, but I think it's all nonsense to  be so careful now.\" If in later years you should hear him complain  that he had nothing to work with, would you feel like pitying him?    No \"kit of tools\" was ever so complete as is the bodily instrument  given to each one of us. Its mechanism has been the inspiration of  inventors; it combines all forms of mechanical devices; its delicacy,  intricacy, completeness and adaptability challenge the admiration of  the philosopher, the engineer, the master mechanic.    I cannot here tell you of all its wonders,[1] but I would like to give  you such an exalted idea of its importance that you would look upon it  with reverence and take a justifiable pride in keeping it in perfect  working order. I would like to make you feel your personal  responsibility in regard to its condition.    You know that in the ages past men believed the body to be the  individual, and they endeavored through care of the body to build up  mental as well as physical power. In those days the acrobat and the  sage were found working side by side in the gymnasium, the one to gain  physical strength, the other to increase his mental ability, and each  profited as he desired.    When men made the discovery that the body is not the individual, but  merely his dwelling and instrument of expression, they came to feel  less regard for it, and lost their interest in its care and culture.  Even the early Christians, forgetting what Paul said about the body as  a temple, began to call it vile, and thought it an evidence of great  piety to treat it with contempt. I have read of one religious sect who  believed that the Creator of the body could not have been the Creator  of the soul, and held that the chief object of God's government was to  deliver the captive souls of men from their bodily prisons.    When men began to understand that the thinking principle was the real  self and the body merely a material encasement, it was no wonder that  they valued the body less and held mind as of great value. They failed  to see that mind without a material organ of expression is, in this  world, of no account. A great pianist with no piano could not make  music, and he would be considered a strange being if he did not care  for his instrument most scrupulously. Think of a Rubinstein  voluntarily breaking the piano strings or smashing the keys, while he  made discordant poundings, and excusing himself by saying that it was  \"fussy\" to take care of a piano until it was old. You cannot imagine  such a thing. We can all appreciate the value of a man-made instrument  or machine; but the God-created body, a combination of machines and  instruments of marvelous power and delicacy, we neglect or treat with  absolute, positive injury, and excuse ourselves on the ground that  when it is old we will treat it more kindly.    Melville says it is a sin to die, ignoring what is to be done with the  body. \"That body,\" he says, \"has been redeemed, that body has been  appointed to a glorious condition.\"    It seems to me we prize the body far more after its use for us is at  an end than while it is ours to use. We do not neglect the dead; we  dress them in beautiful garments, we adorn them with flowers, we  follow them to the grave with religious ceremonies, we build costly  monuments to place over their graves, and then we go to weep over  their last resting-place.    After all, is it not life that we should value? Life here and  hereafter, not death, is the real thing for which we should prepare,  and earthly life without a sound body is not life full and complete.  Life is joy, vigor, elasticity, freedom from pain or illness,  enjoyment of all innocent pleasures in maturity as well as in youth.  We have no right to look forward to decrepitude, to failure in zest of  living, to lessening of real enjoyment because of coming years. Life  should increase in beauty and usefulness, in ability and joyousness,  as the years bring us a wider experience, and this will be the case if  we in youth have been wise enough to lay the foundation of health by a  wise, thoughtful, prudent care of our bodies and our minds.

If I can arouse in your mind a most earnest desire to be strong and  vigorous, I shall not find it necessary to give you very minute  directions, for if you have the ambition you will find the way. If I  could excite in you an intense longing to visit Paris, I should know  that you would begin to seek for the way of getting there. If I could  create in you an earnest aspiration to be well and physically strong,  I should know that you would seek for the books that would give you  the necessary instruction. It will not be needful to talk of rules and  restrictions if I can make you feel the glory of having a sound body.    If you were starting on a journey, I should not need to warn you of  by-paths, of traps, or of dangers if I could be assured that your eye  was fixed upon your ultimate destination. So it is in the matter of  health; and yet there are some general rules or principles which I  might lay down for your consideration.    In regard to the matter of diet. I do not want you to be hampered by  \"don'ts\" and restrictions as to what you shall eat, but I do want you  to eat with the thought in view that eating is to be governed by  judgment and not by the pleasures of sense. Why do we eat? Not merely  because the food tastes good. There is a better reason. We eat to  live. We know that the food which we take into our bodies is digested,  elaborated and assimilated--that is, made over into ourselves--and  unless this digestion, elaboration and assimilation is properly  conducted, we shall not be fully and completely nourished. Our body is  made up of cells; the food which we eat is transformed into cell  structure, and this new cell-material takes the place of the worn-out  cells. Our reason would tell us that if too little material is  furnished, cells will not be properly repaired and ill-health will  follow. Our reason would tell us in the same way that if too much  material is furnished, the machine will be clogged and the work will  not be properly done. We will also understand at once that an  irregular supply of new material would interfere with the elaboration  of that which is undergoing the process of digestion and assimilation.  We can see, too, that unless the various tissues receive the material  which they can transform into themselves, they will not be fully  repaired. If material is taken into the system which supplies no  tissue with what it needs, this material becomes a source"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#4)"],[1,"was to call him to an account for what I was now sensible he was  doing. So he, in great haste, went to his lodging. But when I was in  the open place of the city, having dismissed the guards I had about me,  excepting one, and ten armed men that were with him, I attempted to make  a speech to the multitude of the people of Tiberias: and, standing on  a certain elevated place, I entreated them not to be so hasty in their  revolt; for that such a change in their behavior would be to their  reproach, and that they would then justly be suspected by those that  should be their governors hereafter, as if they were not likely to be  faithful to them neither.    18. But before I had spoken all I designed, I heard one of my own  domestics bidding me come down, for that it was not a proper time to  take care of retaining the good-will of the people of Tiberias, but to  provide for my own safety, and escape my enemies there; for John had  chosen the most trusty of those armed men that were about him out of  those thousand that he had with him, and had given them orders when he  sent them, to kill me, having learned that I was alone, excepting some  of my domestics. So those that were sent came as they were ordered, and  they had executed what they came about, had I not leaped down from the  elevation I stood on, and with one of my guards, whose name was James,  been carried [out of the crowd] upon the back of one Herod of Tiberias,  and guided by him down to the lake, where I seized a ship, and got into  it, and escaped my enemies unexpectedly, and came to Tarichese.    19. Now, as soon as the inhabitants of that city understood the  perfidiousness of the people of Tiberias, they were greatly provoked at  them. So they snatched up their arms, and desired me to be their leader  against them; for they said they would avenge their commander's cause  upon them. They also carried the report of what had been done to me to  all the Galileans, and eagerly endeavored to irritate them against the  people of Tiberias, and desired that vast numbers of them would get  together, and come to them, that they might act in concert with their  commander, what should be determined as fit to be done. Accordingly,  the Galileans came to me in great numbers, from all parts, with their  weapons, and besought me to assault Tiberias, to take it by force,  and to demolish it, till it lay even with the ground, and then to make  slaves of its inhabitants, with their wives and children. Those that  were Josephus's friends also, and had escaped out of Tiberias, gave him  the same advice. But I did not comply with them, thinking it a  terrible thing to begin a civil war among them; for I thought that this  contention ought not to proceed further than words; nay, I told them  that it was not for their own advantage to do what they would have me to  do, while the Romans expected no other than that we should destroy one  another by our mutual seditions. And by saying this, I put a stop to the  anger of the Galileans.    20. But now John was afraid for himself, since his treachery had proved  unsuccessful. So he took the armed men that were about him, and removed  from Tiberias to Gischala, and wrote to me to apologize for himself  concerning What had been done, as if it had been done without his  approbation, and desired me to have no suspicion of him to his  disadvantage. He also added oaths and certain horrible curses upon  himself, and supposed he should be thereby believed in the points he  wrote about to me.    21. But now another great number of the Galileans came together again  with their weapons, as knowing the man, how wicked and how sadly  perjured he was, and desired me to lead them against him and promised me  that they would utterly both him and Gischala. Hereupon I professed that  I was obliged to them for their readiness to serve me, and that I would  more than requite their good-will to me. However, I entreated them to  restrain themselves, and begged of them to give me leave to do what I  intended, which was to put an end to these troubles without bloodshed;  and when I had prevailed with the multitude of the Galileans to let me  do so, I came to Sepphoris.    22. But the inhabitants of this city having determined to continue in  their allegiance to the Romans, were afraid of my coming to them, and  tried, by putting me upon another action, to divert me, that they might  be freed from the terror they were in. Accordingly, they sent to Jesus,  the captain of those robbers who were in the confines of Ptolemais, and  promised to give him a great deal of money, if he would come with those  forces he had with him, which were in number eight hundred, and fight  with us. Accordingly, he complied with what they desired, upon the  promises they had made him, and was desirous to fall upon us when we  were unprepared for him, and knew nothing of his coming beforehand.  So he sent to me, and desired that I would give him leave to come and  salute me. When I had given him that leave, which I did without the  least knowledge of his treacherous intentions beforehand, he took his  band of robbers, and made haste to come to me. Yet did not this his  knavery succeed well at last; for as he was already nearly approaching,  one of those with him deserted him, and came to me, and told me what  he had undertaken to do. When I was informed of this, I went into the  market-place, and pretended to know nothing of his treacherous purpose.  I took with me many Galileans that were armed, as also some of those  of Tiberias; and, when I had given orders that all the roads should be  carefully guarded, I charged the keepers of the gates to give admittance  to none but Jesus, when he came, with the principal of his men, and to  exclude the rest; and in case they aimed to force themselves in, to use  stripes [in order to repel them]. Accordingly, those that had received  such a charge did as they were bidden, and Jesus came in with a few  others; and when I had ordered him to throw down his arms immediately,  and told him, that if he refused so to do, he was a dead man, he seeing  armed men standing all round about him, was terrified, and complied;  and as for those of his followers that were excluded, when they were  informed that he was seized, they ran away. I then called Jesus to me  by himself, and told him, \"that I was not a stranger to that treacherous  design he had against me, nor was I ignorant by whom he was sent for;  that, however, I would forgive him what he had done already, if he  would repent of it, and be faithful to me hereafter.\" And thus, upon his  promise to do all that I desired, I let him go, and gave him leave  to get those whom he had formerly had with him together again. But I  threatened the inhabitants of Sepphoris, that, if they would not leave  off their ungrateful treatment of me, I would punish them sufficiently.    23. At this time it was that two great men, who were under the  jurisdiction of the king [Agrippa] came to me out of the region of  Trachonius, bringing their horses and their arms, and carrying with them  their money also; and when the Jews would force them to be circumcised,  if they would stay among them, I would not permit them to have any force  put upon them, [11] but said to them, \"Every one ought to worship God  according to his own inclinations, and not to be constrained by force;  and that these men, who had fled to us for protection, ought not to be  so treated as to repent of their coming hither.\" And when I had pacified  the multitude, I provided for the men that were come to us whatsoever  it was they wanted, according to their usual way of living, and that in  great plenty also.    24. Now king Agrippa sent an army to make themselves masters of the  citadel of Gamala, and over it Equieulus Modius; but the forces that  were sent were not allow to encompass the citadel quite round, but lay  before it in the open places, and besieged it. But when Ebutius the  decurion, who was intrusted with the government of the great plain,  heard that I was at Simonias, a village situated in the confines of  Galilee, and was distant from him sixty furlongs, he took a hundred  horsemen that were with him by night, and a certain number of footmen,  about two hundred, and brought the inhabitants of the city Gibea along  with him as auxiliaries, and marched in the night, and came to the  village where I abode. Upon this I pitched my camp over against him,  which had a great number of forces in it: but Ebutius tried to draw  us down into the plain, as greatly depending upon his horsemen; but we  would not come down; for when I was satisfied of the advantage that  his horse would have if we came down into the plain, while we were  all footmen, I resolved to join battle with the enemy where I was. Now  Ebutius and his party made a courageous opposition for some time; but  when he saw that his horse were useless to him in that place, he retired  back to the city Gibea, having lost three of his men in the fight. So I  followed him directly with two thousand armed men; and when I was at the  city Besara, that lay in the confines of Ptolemais, but twenty furlongs  from Gibea, where Ebutius abode, I placed my armed men on the outside  of the village, and gave orders that they should guard the passes with  great care, that the enemy might not disturb us until we should have  carried off the corn, a great quantity of which lay there: it belonged  to Bernice the queen, and had been gathered together out of the  neighboring villages into Besara; so I loaded my camels and asses, a  great number of which I had brought along with me, and sent the corn  into Galilee. When I had done this, I offered Ebutius battle; but when  he would not accept of the offer, for he was terrified at our readiness  and courage, I altered my route, and marched towards Neopolitanus,  because I had heard that the country about Tiberias was laid waste by  him."]]]
