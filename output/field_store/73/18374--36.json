The Strike of the Fireworks       'Twas the night before the Fourth of July, the people slept serene;   The fireworks were stored in the old town hall that stood                 on the village green.   The steeple clock tolled the midnight hour, and at its final stroke,   The fire in the queer old-fashioned stove lifted its voice and spoke;   \"The earth and air have naught to do, the water, too, may play,   And only fire is made to work on Independence Day.     \"I won't stand such injustice! It's wrong, beyond a doubt,   And I shall take my holiday. Good-by, I'm going out!\"   Up spoke a Roman candle then, \"The principle is right!   Suppose we strike, and all agree we will not work to-night!\"   \"My stars!\" said a small sky-rocket. \"What an awful time there'll be,   When the whole town comes together to-night, the great display to see!\"   \"Let them come,\" said a saucy pinwheel, \"yes, let them come if they like,   As a delegate I'll announce to them that the fireworks                 are going to strike!\"   \"My friends,\" said a small cap-pistol, \"this movement is all wrong,--   Gunpowder, noise, and fireworks to Fourth of July belong.   My great ancestral musket made Independence Day,   I frown on your whole conspiracy, and you are wrong, I say!\"     And so they talked and they argued, some for and some against,--   And they progressed no further than they were when they commenced.   Until in a burst of eloquence a queer little piece of punk   Arose in his place and said, \"I think we ought to show some spunk.   And I for one have decided, although I am no shirk,   That to-day is a legal holiday and not even fire should work.     \"And I am of some importance,\"--here he gave a pretentious cough,   \"For without my assistance none of you could very well be put off.\"   \"You are right,\" said the Roman candle, \"and I think we are all agreed   To strike for our rights and our liberty. Hurrah! we shall succeed!\"   The dissenters cried with one accord, \"Our objections we withdraw.   Hurrah, hurrah for the fireworks' strike!\" and they cried again, \"Hurrah!\"     Then a match piped up with a tiny voice, \"Your splendid scheme I like.   I agree with all your principles and so I, too, will strike!\"   Suiting the action to the word, the silly little dunce   Clambered down from his matchsafe and excitedly struck at once.   He lost his head, and he ran around among the fireworks dry,   And he cried, \"Hurrah for the fireworks' strike! Hurrah for the                 Fourth of July!\"     With his waving flame he lit the punk--a firecracker caught a spark,--   Then rockets and wheels and bombs went off--no longer the place was dark!   The explosions made a fearful noise, the flames leaped high and higher,   The village folk awoke and cried, \"The town hall is on fire!\"   So the strike of the fireworks ended in a wonderful display   Of pyrotechnic grandeur on Independence Day!           The Arch Armadillo       [Illustration]     There once was an arch Armadillo   Who built him a hut 'neath a willow;         He hadn't a bed         So he rested his head   On a young Porcupine for a pillow.           A Dream Lesson       Once there was a little boy who wouldn't go to bed,   When they hinted at the subject he would only shake his head,   When they asked him his intentions, he informed them pretty straight   That he wouldn't go to bed at all, and Nursey needn't wait.     As their arguments grew stronger, and their attitude more strict,   I grieve to say that naughty boy just yelled and screamed and kicked.   And he made up awful faces, and he told them up and down   That he wouldn't go to bed for all the nurses in the town.     Then Nursey lost her patience, and although it wasn't right,   Retorted that for all she cared he might sit up all night.   He approved of this arrangement, and he danced a jig for joy,   And turned a somersault with glee; he _was_ a naughty boy.     And so they all went off to bed and left him sitting there,   Right in the corner by the fire in Grandpa's big armchair.   He read his books and played his games,--he even sang a song   And thought how lovely it would be to sit up all night long.     [Illustration]     But soon his games grew stupid, and his puzzles wouldn't work;   He drew himself up stiffly with a sudden little jerk,   And he said, \"I am not sleepy, and I love to play alone--   And--I--think--\" the rest was mumbled in a drowsy monotone.     He leaned back on the cushions like that night he had the croup;   His head began to wobble and his eyes began to droop;   He closed them for a minute, just to see how it would seem,   And straightway he was sound asleep, and dreamed this awful dream!     He thought he saw a garden filled with flowers and roses gay,   A great big gardener with a hoe came walking down his way;   \"Ah, ha!\" exclaimed the gardener, as he clutched him by the head,   \"Here's a fine specimen I've found; I'll plant him in this bed!\"     [Illustration]     He held the boy in one big hand, unheeding how he cried,   And with the other dug a hole enormous, deep, and wide.   He jammed the little fellow in, and said in gruffest tone,   \"This is the bed for naughty boys who won't go to their own.\"     And then the dirt was shovelled in,--it covered up his toes,   His ankles, knees, and waist and arms, and higher yet it rose.   For still the gardener shovelled on, not noticing his cries;   It came up to his chin and mouth--it almost reached his eyes;     Just then he gathered all his strength and gave an awful scream,   And woke himself, and put an end to that terrific dream.   And he said, as Nursey tucked him up and bade him snugly rest,   \"When I am planted in a bed, I like my own the best.\"           The Rivals       [Illustration]     Two well-built men, neither giant nor dwarf,   Were Monsieur Elims and Mynheer Nworf.   They lived in a town not far away,   And spent their time in work and play.   Now Monsieur Elims was loved by all--   By rich and poor, by great and small.   And Mynheer Nworf remarked one day,   \"Brother, explain to me, I pray,   Why no one likes me as well as you,   No matter what I may say or do.   I have stores of knowledge packed in my head;   I am learned and wise and very well read;   I can dance, I can sing, I'm extremely polite;   I am worth a large fortune all in my own right.   But still,--and this question has caused me much thought,--   While I am neglected, you're everywhere sought.\"   Monsieur Elims replied: \"My dear sir, that is true,   But you see, I am I, and you see, you are you.   If I receive praises and you receive blame,   'Tis doubtless because each lives up to his name.\"     You'll find his defence rather puzzling, I fear;   But read their names backward--the meaning is clear.           The New Cup       \"I've a lovely new cup from Uncle John,\"     Said Dorothy; \"only see--   It has beautiful golden letters on,     And they spell '_Remember Me_.'\"     \"Oho!\" laughed Fred. \"Why, Dorothy dear,     They put that on mugs and plates:   _I_'ve studied jography 'most a year,     And I know the names of the States.     And when you see that anywhere,--     At least, since this fuss with Spain,--   It's the President who puts it there,     And it means 'Remember the Maine'!\"           A Photographic Failure       [Illustration]         Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle       Saw a patient Periwinkle   With a kodak, sitting idly by a rill.       Feeling a desire awaken       For to have his picture taken,   Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle stood stock-still.         Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle       Felt his brow begin to wrinkle,   And his pose assume a sad and solemn style;       But the Periwinkle trusted,       As the focus he adjusted,   That his customer would kindly try to smile.         Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle       Felt his eyes begin to twinkle,   And his mouth took on a broad and open grin;       Said the Periwinkle, sadly,       \"If you stretch your jaw so madly,   I fear perhaps that I shall tumble in.\"         Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle       Felt his hair begin to crinkle,   As it rose up on his forehead in affright;       Though his comrade spoke so mildly,       Mr. Hinkle wondered wildly,   How he could escape this dire and awful plight.         Mr. Hezekiah Hinkle       Said, \"I fear it's going to sprinkle,   And really for a storm I'm not prepared.\"       Then without a further warning       He politely said, \"Good morning,\"   And the patient Periwinkle stood and stared.

On the contrary, they  have made the difficulties next to insurmountable to accomplish  amendments to an instrument which was perfect for five millions of  people, but not wholly so as to thirty millions. Your patriotism will  surmount the difficulties, however great, if you will but accomplish  one triumph in advance, and that is, a triumph over _party_.

Mr. EWING:--I move that the remaining portion of the report of the  Committee on Organization be postponed until to-morrow.    The motion of Mr. EWING was agreed to.    Mr. WICKLIFFE. I offer the following resolution:         _Resolved_, That the Conference shall be opened with prayer,       and that the clergymen of the city of Washington be       requested to perform that service.    The resolution offered by Mr. WICKLIFFE was adopted, and prayer was  then offered by the Rev. Dr. P.D. GURLEY, of Washington.    The PRESIDENT:--I have received a communication from the Messrs.  Willard, placing the Hall in which the Conference is now sitting at  the service of the Conference, while its sessions may continue; also,  a communication from the Mayor and Common Council of the City of  Washington, offering police officers to attend our sittings.    It was moved, and agreed to, that these offers be severally accepted.    Mr. JOHNSON, of Maryland:--I move that the President of the Conference  be requested to furnish a copy of his address to the Conference upon  taking the Chair, that it be entered upon the journal as a part of  this day's proceedings, and that the same be published.    Which motion was unanimously agreed to.    Mr. GRIMES, of Iowa:--I have received from the Governor of the State  of Iowa a communication, requesting myself and my colleague in the  Senate of the United States, and also the members representing that  State in the House of Representatives, to represent the State of Iowa  here. I desire to present his communication, that it may be referred  to the Committee on Credentials.    The communication was so referred, and on motion of Mr. WRIGHT, of  Ohio, the Conference adjourned.          THIRD DAY.    WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, _February 6th, 1861._      The Conference met at twelve o'clock, at noon, and was called to order  by the PRESIDENT.    The Journal of yesterday was read, and after amendment, was approved.    Mr. SUMMERS:--I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials to make  a report.

Grimes, Samuel H. Curtis, William Vandever.    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--I move that the Secretary be authorized to employ one  or more assistants. I am advised that the Secretary cannot perform his  duties without assistance, and I see no objection to giving him this  authority.    The motion of Mr. WICKLIFFE was agreed to.    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--I now desire to call up the remaining portion of the  report of the Committee on Rules and Organization, and to move its  adoption at the present time. These Rules are substantially the same  as those which were adopted by the convention which proposed our  present Constitution. The rule which we have reported securing  secrecy, so far as our proceedings are concerned, has been made the  subject of much discussion in the committee; and it was at first  thought best to recommend a modification of it. But upon reflection  and consideration, and in view of the fact that, while the rule  reported requires that secrecy should be preserved in regard to all  that is said or done in this Conference, it does not prevent any  member from expressing his own hopes or predictions upon the final  result of our deliberations, we have thought best to let it remain as  it is.    Mr. SEDDON:--I desire to offer an amendment to this portion of the  report of the committee, which I will read for the information of the  Conference. It is as follows:         \"_Resolved_, That no part of the Journal be published       without the order or leave of the Conference, and that no       copies of the whole or any part be furnished or allowed,       except to members, who shall be privileged to communicate       the same to the authorities or deliberative assemblies of       their respective States, when deemed judicious or       appropriate, under their instructions, and that nothing       spoken in the House be printed or otherwise published; but       private communications respecting the proceedings and       debates, while recommended to be with caution and reserve,       are allowed at the discretion of each member.\"    It may be thought, that in offering this resolution, I am seeking a  different end from the one I proposed yesterday, when I advocated the  proposition of excluding reporters from our sessions, and insisted  that our proceedings should be at all times under the seal of secrecy.  Such, however, is not my purpose. But some discretion must be allowed  us, in order that we may conform to and carry out the spirit of the  resolutions under which we respectively act. This is especially true  in relation to myself and my colleagues. The resolutions under which  we are acting, require that we should from time to time communicate to  the legislature of Virginia the proceedings of this body, and to  express our own opinions of the prospect which may exist of the  settlement of existing difficulties. The Commissioners from Virginia  would be placed in a delicate, not to say an awkward position, by the  adoption of a rule here which would absolutely prohibit such  communications. I hope my amendment may be adopted.    Mr. TUCK:--Would not the purpose of the gentleman from Virginia be  answered by giving any delegation leave to communicate any action  actually taken by the Conference, with their own opinions as to the  probable result of our deliberations?    Mr. SEDDON:--Those opinions would possess no value, unless the facts  and circumstances are communicated upon which they are founded. It is  very clear to me, that the best course will be to entrust to the  discretion of each member the privilege of making these  communications, trusting that he will not abuse the confidence thus  given.    Mr. WICKLIFFE:--I hope we have all come here with an earnest desire to  harmonize our conflicting opinions, and to unite upon some plan which  will settle our troubles and save the union of the States. The South  has spoken of the North in very severe terms, and the North has not  been slow in returning the compliment. If we come finally, to any  definite result satisfactory to either side, it must be by mutual  concessions, by confessing our sins to each other, and endeavoring to  live harmoniously together in future. In my judgment, secrecy is  absolutely indispensable to successful action here. I do not wish to  be precluded from abandoning a position to-morrow, if I see cause for  it, which I have taken to-day. If the proceedings, and especially the  debates of this Conference, are made public from day to day, they will  go into the newspapers and be made the subject of comment, favorable  or otherwise. The necessary result will be, that when a member is  understood to have committed himself to a particular proposition, or  any special course of policy, that pride of opinion, which we all  possess, will render any change of policy on his part difficult, if  not impossible. I should sincerely regret the adoption of the  resolution of the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. RANDOLPH:--I move that the portion of the committee's report under  consideration, together with the resolution of Mr. SEDDON, be  recommitted to the Committee on Rules and Organization.    The motion of Mr. RANDOLPH was agreed to.    Mr. GUTHRIE:--I have an idea relating to the plan which should be  adopted to carry into effect the purpose of this Conference. I wish to  propose it. We have come together upon the invitation of the glorious  old commonwealth of Virginia, the mother of States and Statesmen. We  have come from the North and the South, from the East"]]]
