Xenophon adds that  this city's name was Larissa and that it had anciently been inhabited by  Medes; that the king of Persia, when he took the sovereignty away from  the Medes, besieged it, but could not in any way get possession of it,  until, a cloud having obscured the sun, the inhabitants forsook the city  and thus it was taken.    4. Some eighteen miles further on (a day's march) the Greeks came to  another great deserted city, which Xenophon calls Mespila. It had a  similar but still higher wall. This city, he tells us, had also been  inhabited by Medes, and taken by the king of Persia. Now these curious  ruins were all that was left of Kalah and Nineveh, the two Assyrian  capitals. In the short space of two hundred years, men had surely not  yet lost the memory of Nineveh's existence and rule, yet they trod the  very site where it had stood and knew it not, and called its ruins by a  meaningless Greek name, handing down concerning it a tradition absurdly  made up of true and fictitious details, jumbled into inextricable  confusion. For Nineveh had been the capital of the Assyrian Empire,  while the Medes were one of the nations who attacked and destroyed it.  And though an eclipse of the sun--(the obscuring cloud could mean  nothing else)--did occur, created great confusion and produced important  results, it was at a later period and on an entirely different occasion.  As to \"the king of Persia,\" no such personage had anything whatever to  do with the catastrophe of Nineveh, since the Persians had not yet been  heard of at that time as a powerful people, and their country was only a  small and insignificant principality, tributary to Media. So effectually  had the haughty city been swept from the face of the earth!    5. Another hundred years brought on other and even greater changes. The  Persian monarchy had followed in the wake of the empires that had gone  before it and fallen before Alexander, the youthful hero of Macedon. As  the conqueror's fleet of light-built Grecian ships descended the  Euphrates towards Babylon, they were often hindered in their progress by  huge dams of stone built across the river. The Greeks, with great labor,  removed several, to make navigation more easy. They did the same on  several other rivers,--nor knew that they were destroying the last  remaining vestige of a great people's civilization,--for these dams had  been used to save the water and distribute it into the numerous canals,  which covered the arid country with their fertilizing network. They may  have been told what travellers are told in our own days by the  Arabs--that these dams had been constructed once upon a time by Nimrod,  the Hunter-King. For some of them remain even still, showing their huge,  square stones, strongly united by iron cramps, above the water before  the river is swollen with the winter rains.    6. More than one-and-twenty centuries have rolled since then over the  immense valley so well named Mesopotamia--\"the Land between the  Rivers,\"--and each brought to it more changes, more wars, more  disasters, with rare intervals of rest and prosperity. Its position  between the East and the West, on the very high-road of marching armies  and wandering tribes, has always made it one of the great battle grounds  of the world. About one thousand years after Alexander's rapid invasion  and short-lived conquest, the Arabs overran the country, and settled  there, bringing with them a new civilization and the new religion given  them by their prophet Mohammed, which they thought it their mission to  carry, by force of word or sword, to the bounds of the earth. They even  founded there one of the principal seats of their sovereignty, and  Baghdad yielded not greatly in magnificence and power to Babylon of old.    7. Order, laws, and learning now flourished for a few hundred years,  when new hordes of barbarous people came pouring in from the East, and  one of them, the Turks, at last established itself in the land and  stayed. They rule there now. The valley of the Tigris and Euphrates is  a province of the Ottoman or Turkish Empire, which has its capital in  Constantinople; it is governed by pashas, officials sent by the Turkish  government, or the \"Sublime Porte,\" as it is usually called, and the  ignorant, oppressive, grinding treatment to which it has now been  subjected for several hundred years has reduced it to the lowest depth  of desolation. Its wealth is exhausted, its industry destroyed, its  prosperous cities have disappeared or dwindled into insignificance. Even  Mossul, built by the Arabs on the right bank of the Tigris, opposite the  spot where Nineveh once stood, one of their finest cities, famous for  the manufacturing of the delicate cotton tissue to which it gave its  name--(_muslin_, _mousseline_)--would have lost all importance, had it  not the honor to be the chief town of a Turkish district and to harbor a  pasha. And Baghdad, although still the capital of the whole province, is  scarcely more than the shadow of her former glorious self; and her looms  no longer supply the markets of the world with wonderful shawls and  carpets, and gold and silver tissues of marvellous designs.    8. Mesopotamia is a region which must suffer under neglect and  misgovernment even more than others; for, though richly endowed by  nature, it is of a peculiar formation, requiring constant care and  intelligent management to yield all the return of which it is capable.  That care must chiefly consist in distributing the waters of the two  great rivers and their affluents over all the land by means of an  intricate system of canals, regulated by a complete and well-kept set  of dams and sluices, with other simpler arrangements for the remoter and  smaller branches. The yearly inundations caused by the Tigris and  Euphrates, which overflow their banks in spring, are not sufficient;  only a narrow strip of land on each side is benefited by them. In the  lowlands towards the Persian Gulf there is another inconvenience: the  country there being perfectly flat, the waters accumulate and stagnate,  forming vast pestilential swamps where rich pastures and wheat-fields  should be--and have been in ancient times. In short, if left to itself,  Upper Mesopotamia, (ancient Assyria), is unproductive from the  barrenness of its soil, and Lower Mesopotamia, (ancient Chaldea and  Babylonia), runs to waste, notwithstanding its extraordinary fertility,  from want of drainage.    9. Such is actually the condition of the once populous and flourishing  valley, owing to the principles on which the Turkish rulers carry on  their government. They look on their remoter provinces as mere sources  of revenue for the state and its officials. But even admitting this as  their avowed and chief object, they pursue it in an altogether  wrong-headed and short-sighted way. The people are simply and openly  plundered, and no portion of what is taken from them is applied to any  uses of local public utility, as roads, irrigation, encouragement of  commerce and industry and the like; what is not sent home to the Sultan  goes into the private pouches of the pasha and his many subaltern  officials. This is like taking the milk and omitting to feed the cow.  The consequence is, the people lose their interest in work of any kind,  leave off striving for an increase of property which they will not be  permitted to enjoy, and resign themselves to utter destitution with a  stolid apathy most painful to witness. The land has been brought to such  a degree of impoverishment that it is actually no longer capable of  producing crops sufficient for a settled population. It is cultivated  only in patches along the rivers, where the soil is rendered so fertile  by the yearly inundations as to yield moderate returns almost unasked,  and that mostly by wandering tribes of Arabs or of Kurds from the  mountains to the north, who raise their tents and leave the spot the  moment they have gathered in their little harvest--if it has not been  appropriated first by some of the pasha's tax-collectors or by roving  parties of Bedouins--robber-tribes from the adjoining Syrian and Arabian  deserts, who, mounted on their own matchless horses, are carried across  the open border with as much facility as the drifts of desert sand so  much dreaded by travellers. The rest of the country is left to nature's  own devices and, wherever it is not cut up by mountains or rocky ranges,  offers the well-known twofold character of steppe-land: luxuriant grassy  vegetation during one-third of the year and a parched, arid waste the  rest of the time, except during the winter rains and spring floods.    10. A wild and desolate scene! Imposing too in its sorrowful grandeur,  and well suited to a land which may be called a graveyard of empires and  nations. The monotony of the landscape would be unbroken, but for  certain elevations and hillocks of strange and varied shapes, which  spring up, as it were, from the plain in every direction; some are high  and conical or pyramidal in form, others are quite extensive and rather  flat on the summit, others again long and low, and all curiously  unconnected with each other or any ridge of hills or mountains. This is  doubly striking in Lower Mesopotamia or Babylonia, proverbial for its  excessive flatness. The few permanent villages, composed of mud-huts or  plaited reed-cabins, are generally built on these eminences, others are  used as burying-grounds, and a mosque, the Mohammedan house of prayer,  sometimes rises on one or the other. They are pleasing objects in the  beautiful spring season, when corn-fields wave on their summits, and  their slopes, as well as all the surrounding plains, are clothed with  the densest and greenest of herbage, enlivened with countless flowers of  every hue, till the surface of the earth looks, from a distance or from  a height, as gorgeous as the richest Persian carpet. But, on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#4)"],[1,"can row a boat or  drive a _carriole_ before they have reached their teens. Such things  they regard as amusements, for they have few other ways of amusing  themselves, and their one ambition is to do what their fathers and  mothers do.    In some cases the small farmers move their whole families up to the  mountain pastures for the summer; and, in addition to the dairy work,  they rent the fishing on some of the mountain lakes, which they  net freely. The trout thus caught are split open and salted down  in barrels, eventually being sent down to the markets in the towns,  where they fetch a good price. And all these peasants possess rifles,  and are keen sportsmen, so that when August comes they go in pursuit  of the wild reindeer, and lay up a store of meat, which, salted and  dried, comes in very handy in the hard times of winter.    As a rule the peasants eat very little meat, and what they do eat has  probably been smoked and dried and hung up for several months. A good  deal of salt fish is consumed; but the principal food is porridge  (_groed_), made of barley, rye, or oatmeal, and eaten generally with  sour buttermilk, with the addition of potatoes, when plentiful. White  bread is not found far from the towns, and the black, or rye, bread  is a heavy compound, a taste for which takes an Englishman some time  to acquire. But even that is superior to the _fladbroed_, which in  appearance and consistency resembles old boot-leather.    The well-to-do farmer lives more sumptuously. He occasionally has fresh  meat and fresh fish, and the dried articles nearly every day. He also  indulges in cheese, usually of the commoner kind, known as _prim_,  or _mysost_, which is not unlike brown Windsor soap. There are two  other native cheeses, but they are considered somewhat expensive  luxuries. They are called _gammelost_ and _pultost_, and are made  from sour skimmed milk, being afterwards kept in a dark cellar for  a year or so to ripen. The latter is the greater delicacy, and is  stored, in a sloppy state, in wooden tubs. If you should ever chance  to see one of the tubs being produced, do not wait to see it opened,  or your nose will never forget it!    Verily, winter is the bugbear of the struggling Norwegian countryman's  existence. Like the provident ant, he spends the greater part of the  summer in laying up for the winter, and he has not only himself and his  family to think of, but also his cattle, for if the latter cannot be  properly housed and fed he will be ruined. There are times, however,  when he contrives to throw off the constant thought of the future,  and when he can enjoy himself thoroughly. Sunday is a day of rest,  with possibly a long row across the fjord to church, after which  comes a good gossip with the neighbours, and the chance of a feast  at a friend's farm. There are also high-days and holidays, weddings  and christenings, accompanied by plentiful food and drink, as well  as by dancing and fiddling.    But when the snow covers up the country the days are none too exciting,  though the cattle have to be fed and many odd jobs attended to. Most  of the men are handy carpenters, and can make such things as dairy  utensils, while the women in many parts weave sufficient cloth to keep  the whole family clothed. By the younger men, however, the season is  looked forward to as a time of real enjoyment. Then it is that they  get out their snowshoes and enter with zest into the grand sport  of ski-ing, or, taking their guns with them, go off on their ski to  shoot ryper or hares for the market.    Such is the life of the ordinary small farmer and peasant; but down  by the fjords and on the beaten track of the foreign tourists the  larger farmer has grasped the situation, and has discovered the value  of having more than one string to his bow. So in summer he combines  hotel-keeping with farming. His farm produce is consumed in his hotel,  and if he is fortunate enough to have a salmon river flowing through  his land, he can be certain of a good rent for it. Thus the prosperous  farmer becomes a person of some importance in the district, and one  day, perhaps, a Member of the Storthing, or Parliament.            CHAPTER V    MANNERS AND CUSTOMS      The religion of the country is the Lutheran, almost in its original  form, for in some matters the Norwegians are most conservative. Though  not, perhaps, what we would consider a religious-minded people, they  are naturally good, honest, and kind, and they take their religion on  trust. They pay tithes, and give Easter and Christmas offerings to  their clergy willingly, since they regard the priest as a superior  person, and hold him in high esteem. He is a man, like his fellows,  and farms his own land, which appeals to the people in the country  parts. Moreover, he is possessed of learning, and away from the towns  he is mainly responsible for the national education.    Often the journey to church is long, for the farms lie far apart, and  when the church is distant ponies or boats are brought into requisition  for the conveyance of, at any rate, the women and children. Down by  the fjord on a fine Sunday morning the sight of the boats crossing  over to a church is a picturesque one. Deep laden with men, women,  and children, they come one after another; and when they reach the  shore, the women take their clean white head-dresses and gay kerchiefs  out of the compact little _tiner_ (oval chip-wood boxes), and finish  their toilets before going up to the church.    The Norwegian Sabbath begins on Saturday evening and ends at noon  on Sunday, after which time the day is spent in simple enjoyment  as a true holiday. Then in the evening the boats start for home,  and across the still waters one may hear the women singing glees,  as often as not to the accompaniment of the fiddle.    A wedding causes quite as much interest and excitement in Norway as it  does in England, and in the olden time the festivities lasted for a  week or more. Nowadays the merry-making has been somewhat curtailed,  but the actual ceremony has lost none of its solemnity and little  of its brightness. In the towns civilization has robbed the wedding  of its picturesqueness. The men are clothed in their best \"blacks,\"  as if going to a funeral, and the ladies wear dresses of Parisian  style. But away in the depths of the country one may still see a real  Norwegian wedding, with the bride and bridesmaids, if not also most of  the guests, dressed in the national costume, and it is a pretty sight.    In front comes a _stolkjaerre_, the pony being led by the master of  the ceremonies. On the seat sits the bride in the full dress of the  country, and wearing her bridal crown; by her side the bridegroom,  also well adorned for the occasion; and, on the step of the cart, that  most important person, the fiddler, working his bow with astounding  energy. If the pony can bear the weight, perhaps a couple of the  bride's relations will sit up behind, otherwise they will walk in the  procession which follows; and there may be seen all the available  peasants of the district--young men and maidens, grandfathers and  grandchildren.    So they wend their way to the church; and after the service, if the  good old customs be kept up, the party proceeds to a green close by  and enjoys a boisterous dance until it is time to go on to the wedding  supper. Feasting and merry-making then continue for several hours--in  fact, the sleepiness of the guests is the only thing that breaks up  the entertainment for the night. Next day the festivities are resumed,  and are possibly carried on into a third day. The fiddler is always  busy, for without him there can be no real fun, the people's love of  music being no less than their love of dancing.    The violin is the one instrument which they know and understand, and  it has been in use among the Norwegians for hundreds of years. Their  most famous violin-player, Ole Bull, who died some few years ago,  was looked on as a great composer and musician. But all over the  country there are to be found men who can play after a fashion; and  a century or so ago, when the people were still very superstitious,  they fully believed that anyone who could play at all well had had  intercourse with the fairies, who were supposed to be marvellous  musicians and acquainted with an immense variety of beautiful tunes.    The food provided at a peasant's wedding feast is, of course, something  out of the common, and the guests are supposed to bring a present of  something good to eat, such as fresh meat, butter, old cream, cream  porridge, or cheese, for the ordinary fare of the country folk is,  as we have said, of the plainest.    With regard to the national costume, mentioned above, it is,  unfortunately, a fact that it is gradually disappearing. There are  parts, however, where there are no railways, no steamboats, and few  tourists, and in such places the people still live much as they did  a hundred years ago, even the men wearing clothes similar to those  worn by their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and some of these  are quaint in the extreme.    Perhaps the quaintest dresses are those of the people of Saetersdal, a  district in the South of Norway, between Christiansand and Telemarken;  and, when properly turned out, the men are quite as \"dressy\" as  the women. They wear a pair of trousers buttoned with half a dozen  silver buttons tight round the ankles, and coming right up to the  armpits. Several broad stripes adorn the legs from top to bottom. And  the coat takes the form of a curious little cape, richly embroidered  with silver, and having sleeves, fastened at the wrists with more  silver buttons. Shoes, with buckles, white stockings, and a cut-down  tall hat, gaily decorated with ribbons and embroidery, complete the  costume. The women wear short skirts--only a little below the knees--of  dark blue, with a bright trimming round the bottom;"]]]
