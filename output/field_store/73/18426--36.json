[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25973"],[0,"Birds of the Rockies (#4)"],[1,"put into the Pipilo group by the ornithologists is  more than I can tell at this moment. He has no analogue in the East.  True, he is a bird of the bushes, running sometimes like a little deer  from one clump to another; but if you should see him mount a boulder or  a bush, and hear him sing his rich, theme-like, finely modulated song,  you would aver that he is closer kin to the thrushes or thrashers than  to the towhees. There is not the remotest suggestion of the towhee  minstrelsy in his prolonged and well-articulated melody. It would be  difficult to find a finer lyrist among the mountains.    But, hold! I have neglected to introduce this pretty Mozart of the West.  He is known by an offensive and inapt title--the green-tailed towhee.  Much more appropriately might he be called the chestnut-crowned towhee,  for his cope is rich chestnut, and the crest is often held erect, making  him look quite cavalier-like. It is the most conspicuous part of his  toilet. His upper parts are grayish-green, becoming slightly deeper  green on the tail, from which fact he derives his common name. His white  throat and chin are a further diagnostic mark. The bright yellow of the  edge of the wings, under coverts and axillaries is seldom seen, on  account of the extreme wariness of the bird.    In most of the dry and bushy places I found him at my elbow--or, rather,  some distance away, but in evidence by his mellifluous song. Let me  enumerate the localities in which I found my little favorite: Forty  miles out on the plain among some bushes of a shallow dip; among the  foothills about Colorado Springs and Manitou; on many of the open bushy  slopes along the cog-road leading to Pike's Peak, but never in the dark  ravines or thick timber; among the bushes just below timber-line on the  southern acclivity of the peak; everywhere around the village of Buena  Vista; about four miles below Leadville; and, lastly, beyond the range  at Red Cliff and Glenwood.[1]        [1] This list was greatly enlarged in my second trip to Colorado in      1901.    The song, besides its melodious quality, is full of expression. In this  respect it excels the liquid chansons of the mountain hermit thrush,  which is justly celebrated as a minstrel, but which does not rehearse a  well-defined theme. The towhee's song is sprightly and cheerful, wild  and free, has the swing of all outdoors, and is not pitched to a minor  key. It gives you the impression that a bird which sings so blithesome a  strain must surely be happy in his domestic relations.    Among the Rockies the black-headed grosbeak is much in evidence, and so  is his cheerful, good-tempered song, which is an exact counterpart of  the song of the rose-breasted grosbeak, his eastern kinsman. Neither the  rose-breast nor the cardinal is to be found in Colorado, but they are  replaced by the black-headed and blue grosbeaks, the former dwelling  among the lower mountains, the latter occurring along the streams of the  plains. Master black-head and his mate are partial to the scrub oaks for  nesting sites. I found one nest with four callow bantlings in it, but,  much to my grief and anger, at my next call it had been robbed of its  precious treasures. A few days later, not far from the same place, a  female was building a nest, and I am disposed to believe that she was  the mother whose children had been kidnapped.    Instead of the scarlet and summer tanagers, the Rocky Mountain region is  honored with that beautiful feathered gentleman, the Louisiana tanager,  most of whose plumage is rich, glossy yellow, relieved by black on the  wings, back, and tail; while his most conspicuous decoration is the  scarlet or crimson tinting of his head and throat, shading off into the  yellow of the breast. These colors form a picturesque combination,  especially if set against a background of green. The crimson staining  gives him the appearance of having washed his face in some bright-red  pigment, and like an awkward child, blotched his bosom with it in the  absence of a napkin.    So far as I could analyze it, there is no appreciable difference between  his lyrical performances and those of the scarlet tanager, both being a  kind of lazy, drawling song, that is slightly better than no bird music  at all. One nest was found without difficulty. It was placed on one of  the lower branches of a pine tree by the roadside at the entrance to  Engleman's Canyon. As a rule, the males are not excessively shy, as so  many of the Rocky Mountain birds are. The tanagers were seen far up in  the mountains, as well as among the foothills, and also at Red Cliff and  Glenwood on the western side of the Divide.    A unique character in feathers, one that is peculiar to the West, is the  magpie, who would attract notice wherever he should deign to live, being  a sort of grand sachem of the outdoor aviary. In some respects the  magpies are striking birds. In flight they present a peculiar  appearance; in fact, they closely resemble boys' kites with their long,  slender tails trailing in the breeze. I could not avoid the impression  that their tails were superfluous appendages, but no doubt they serve  the birds a useful purpose as rudders and balancing-poles. The magpie  presents a handsome picture as he swings through the air, the iridescent  black gleaming in the sun, beautifully set off with snowy-white  trimmings on both the upper and lower surfaces of the wings. On the  perch or on the wing he is an ornament to any landscape. As to his  voice--well, he is a genuine squawker. There is not, so far as I have  observed, a musical cord in his larynx,[2] and I am sure he does not  profess to be a musical genius, so that my criticism will do him no  injury. All the use he has for his voice seems to be to call his fellows  to a new-found banquet, or give warning of the approach of an interloper  upon his chosen preserves. His cry, if you climb up to his nest, is  quite pitiful, proving that he has real love for his offspring. Perhaps  the magpies have won their chief distinction as architects. Their nests  are really remarkable structures, sometimes as large as fair-sized  tubs, the framework composed of good-sized sticks, skilfully plaited  together, and the cup lined with grass and other soft material, making a  cosey nursery for the infantile magpies. Then the nest proper is roofed  over, and has an entrance to the apartment on either side. When you  examine the structure closely, you find that it fairly bristles with dry  twigs and sticks, and it is surprising how large some of the branches  are that are braided into the domicile. All but one of the many nests I  found were deserted, for my visit was made in June, and the birds, as a  rule, breed earlier than that month. Some were placed in bushes, some in  willow and cottonwood trees, and others in pines; and the birds  themselves were almost ubiquitous, being found on the plains, among the  foothills, and up in the mountains as far as the timber-line, not only  close to human neighborhoods, but also in the most inaccessible  solitudes.        [2] In this volume the author has made use of the terminology      usually employed in describing bird music. Hence such words as      \"song,\" \"chant,\" \"vocal cords,\" etc., are of frequent occurrence. In      reality the writer's personal view is that the birds are whistlers,      pipers, fluters, and not vocalists, none of the sounds they produce      being real voice tones. The reader who may desire to go into this      matter somewhat technically is referred to Maurice Thompson's      chapter entitled \"The Anatomy of Bird-Song\" in his \"Sylvan Secrets,\"      and the author's article, \"Are Birds Singers or Whistlers?\" in \"Our      Animal Friends\" for June, 1901.    In one of my excursions along a stream below Colorado Springs, one nest  was found that was still occupied by the brooding bird. It was a bulky  affair, perhaps half as large as a bushel basket, placed in the crotch  of a tree about thirty feet from the ground. Within this commodious  structure was a globular apartment which constituted the nest proper.  Thus it was roofed over, and had an entrance at each side, so that the  bird could go into his house at one doorway and out at the other, the  room being too small to permit of his turning around in it. Thinking the  nest might be occupied, in a tentative way I tossed a small club up  among the branches, when to my surprise a magpie sprang out of the nest,  and, making no outcry, swung around among the trees, appearing quite  nervous and shy. When she saw me climbing the tree, she set up such a  heart-broken series of cries that I permitted sentiment to get the  better of me, and clambered down as fast as I could, rather than prolong  her distress. Since then I have greatly regretted my failure to climb up  to the nest and examine its contents, which might have been done without  the least injury to the owner's valuable treasures. A nestful of  magpie's eggs or bairns would have been a gratifying sight to my  bird-hungry eyes.    One bird which is familiar in the East as well as the West deserves  attention on account of its choice of haunts. I refer to the turtle  dove, which is much hardier than its mild and innocent looks would seem  to indicate. It may be remarked, in passing, that very few birds are  found in the deep canyons and gorges leading up to the higher localities;  but the doves seem to constitute the one exception to the rule; for I  saw them in some of the gloomiest defiles through which the train  scurried in crossing the mountains. For instance, in the canyon of the  Arkansas River many of them were seen from the car window, a pair just  beyond the Royal Gorge darting across the turbulent stream to the other  side. A number were also noticed in the darkest portions of the canyon of  the Grand River, where one would think not a living creature could coax  subsistence from the bare rocks and beetling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25990"],[0,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build (#4)"],[1,"nests of eggs. It is the writer's belief that  every boy who makes one or more of the projects in this booklet, and  sees it occupied, will become one of a growing number who will care  for instead of destroy the birds of his neighborhood. Further, if  every man who now thoughtlessly or willfully destroys birds, knew the  real money value of the work birds do, he would build or buy houses  and food shelters to increase Nature's best friends to mankind.    The second group of enemies include ants and other vermin which at  times infest nests and nesting boxes, snakes, squirrels, mice and  rats. Protection against this group is afforded by bands of tin about  the pole, or spikes of wood or metal pointing downward so that access  is impossible by climbing up the pole. Another protection is to make  the entrance holes small enough to admit only the occupant for whom  the house was intended. Of course, the houses for the larger birds  must be protected in other ways. Charles Tesch of Milwaukee suggests a  sticky fly paper compound made of resin (melted) and castor oil as a  preventive for the inroads of the small red ant, if suitable support  is available.    The final group consists of the two worst foes of bird life, cats and  English or house sparrows. If you really value the birds that have  been reared in the house you have built you may need to get up _early_  more than one morning when the youngsters leave the nest to protect  them from the highly respectable (?) tabby that lives possibly next  door if not at your own house. It often comes to a choice between cats  and birds: and the cats may be disposed of in two ways--the right kind  of box traps for the homeless and unknown robbers, and an air rifle  with sufficient \"sting\" for the trespasser from next door. A few  lessons of this kind usually have some effect.    The English or house sparrow was introduced into this country about a  half-century ago. It has spread over practically all of the United  States and Southern Canada. Possibly no bird has exhibited such powers  of adapting itself to new conditions. The sparrow is no respecter of  places for locating its nest. It lives on a variety of foods changing  from one to another as the necessity arises. In spite of opposition,  this bird is constantly on the increase, so much so that in many cases  more desirable native birds have been obliged to leave. The sparrow is  filthy and quarrelsome, and lives mainly upon valuable small grains in  every case where this is possible. There are two methods possible  which afford partial relief: (1) traps and (2) driving them away with  an air-rifle. Traps are usually successful for a comparatively brief  time, since the sparrows soon associate the trap with danger and so  avoid it. A very successful type of woven wire trap is advocated by  the Department of Agriculture but is probably beyond the ability of  the average boy to make well. It sells by commercial manufacturers of  bird supplies for about $4.00. This trap works all the year around as  it depends upon the attraction of food. Fig. 65 gives a simple, yet  effective trap. However, it requires the presence of some hidden  observer to spring it at the right moment. Another type of trap is  based upon the nest-house idea. Its effectiveness is limited largely  to the nesting season, though it may be used by the birds for shelter.  One of the most efficient traps was invented by Charles Tesch, of  Milwaukee, Wis. Its principle is that of a tipping chamber leading  into a sack thru a chute. Fig. 64 gives the dimensions to be followed  in making such a trap. The inventor says that the bag should be far  enough away from the box to make certain that the victim has no chance  to tell the others what happened to him by chirping, otherwise they  will no longer enter the trap. The box must be perfectly tight in  order to prevent drafts from issuing thru the entrance which will  cause sparrows to keep away. If a few feathers are glued or shellacked  to the tipping chamber floor, the sparrow is often attracted more  strongly. The bag should be examined frequently to liberate bluebirds  and wrens, who may have been caught.    [Illustration: FIG. 64. (SPARROW TRAP)]    [Illustration: FIG. 65. (SPARROW TRAP)]    However, fighting bird enemies without the cooperation of neighbors is  not an easy matter. In the case of sparrows, so many more are left  that traps alone are ineffective. An airgun properly used offers some  help in the city to drive them away from the premises, while a shot  gun or 22 caliber rifle are more effective in the country. If every  sparrow nest were torn down and no place given them in your  neighborhood, the pest is likely to avoid your grounds. Finally, keep  nesting boxes free from sparrows while the owners are away for the  winter.          BIRD HOUSE EXHIBITIONS.      Many cities are beginning to do excellent work along the lines of bird  preservation and attraction. This usually leads into an exhibition or  contest, though many times quantities of houses are made and sold for  other purposes, such as raising money for athletic suits for the  school teams.    At Cleveland, Ohio, a large number of houses such as are shown in  Figs. 15-19 were made for the city Bird Lovers' Association to be  placed in the city parks. The boys received the profits of the sale  after materials were paid for. In the Mercer Center, Seattle, Wash.,  the boys wanted suits for the \"team.\" Bird houses were made in dozen  lots for a large department store, and soon the boys had all the money  the suits cost. Fig. 36 shows a group of 7th grade boys with the  houses made in two class periods of two hours each. At St. Paul,  Minn., the annual exhibit has become a larger affair than the  automobile show. This year it will be held in the city auditorium  which seats 10,000 people. The city council will pay the rent of this  building for a week and the boys will see that it is filled with bird  houses. Up to date (March 11, 1916) over $1,000 worth of orders have  been taken for houses to be delivered after the exhibition. Fig. 62  shows the palm room at the St. Paul exhibit in 1915. The county making  the most bird houses in 1915, so far as has been reported, was  Allegheny County, Pa., where approximately 15,000 houses were  produced. Fig. 67 shows the prize winners in a department store  contest at Pittsburgh, Pa., while an exhibit in the same city is shown  in Fig. 66.    [Illustration: FIG. 66. THE PITTSBURGH EXHIBIT.]    [Illustration: FIG. 67. PRIZEWINNERS IN DEPARTMENT STORE CONTEST.]    Space will not permit giving extended rules for such contests since  the rules must vary with each city. Briefly, there should be provision  made to give all competitors an equal chance. Boys of the 6th grade  should meet others of that grade. Prizes may be awarded for the best  houses made for the more common birds, such as wrens, bluebirds, and  martins. These should be judged as to adaptability or fitness to  purpose, amount of protection afforded to birds, good workmanship and  artistic merit. A prize might be awarded to the boy whose house has  the first pair of birds nesting in it. Prizes may be of many kinds,  but tools and books, as well as cash prizes are often given by local  business men.          WHERE MORE INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED.      U. S.
