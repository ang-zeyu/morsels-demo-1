He and his friends added  divers things to convince us that they were both desirous that we  should hear them, and resolved against our doing so, unless we allowed  them sometimes to hear us. _Elutherius_ [Transcriber's Note:  Eleutherius] after having a while fruitlesly endeavoured to obtain  leave to be silent promis'd he would not be so alwayes, provided that  he were permitted according to the freedom of his Genious and  Principles to side with one of them in the managing of one Argument,  and, if he saw cause, with his Antagonist, in the Prosecution of  another, without being confin'd to stick to any one party or Opinion,  which was after some debate accorded him. But I conscious to my own  Disability's told them resolutely that _I_ was as much more willing as  more fit to be a hearer then a speaker, among such knowing Persons,  and on so abstruse a Subject. And that therefore I beseeched them  without necessitating me to proclaim my weaknesses, to allow me to  lessen them by being a silent Auditor of their Discourses: to suffer  me to be at which I could present them no motive, save that their  instructions would make them in me a more intelligent Admirer. I  added, that I desir'd not to be idle whilst they were imploy'd, but  would if they pleas'd, by writing down in short hand what should be  delivered, preserve Discourses that I knew would merit to be lasting.  At first _Carneades_ and his two friends utterly rejected this motion;  and all that my Resoluteness to make use of my ears, not tongue, at  their debates, could do, was to make them acquiesce in the Proposition  of _Eleutherius_, who thinking himself concern'd, because he brought  me thither, to afford me some faint assistance, was content that I  should register their Arguments, that I might be the better able after  the conclusion of their conference to give them my sence upon the  Subject of it, (The number of Elements or Principles:) which he  promis'd I should do at the end of the present Debates, if time would  permit, or else at our next meeting. And this being by him undertaken  in my name, though without my consent, the company would by no means  receive my Protestation against it, but casting, all at once, their  eyes on _Carneades_, they did by that and their unanimous silence,  invite him to begin; which (after a short pause, during which he  turn'd himself to _Eleutherius_ and me) he did in this manner.    Notwithstanding the subtile reasonings I have met with in the books of  the Peripateticks, and the pretty experiments that have been shew'd me  in the Laboratories of Chymists, I am of so diffident, or dull a  Nature, as to think that if neither of them can bring more cogent  arguments to evince the truth of their assertion then are wont to be  brought; a Man may rationally enough retain some doubts concerning the  very number of those materiall Ingredients of mixt bodies, which some  would have us call Elements, and others principles. Indeed when I  considered that the Tenents concerning the Elements are as  considerable amongst the Doctrines of natural Philosophy as the  Elements themselves are among the bodies of the Universe, I expected  to find those Opinions solidly establish'd, upon which so many others  are superstructed. But when I took the pains impartially to examine  the bodies themselves that are said to result from the blended  Elements, and to torture them into a confession of their constituent  Principles, I was quickly induc'd to think that the number of the  Elements has been contended about by Philosophers with more  earnestness then success. This unsatisfiedness of mine has been much  wonder'd at, by these two Gentlemen (at which words he pointed at  _Themistius_ and _Philoponus_) who though they differ almost as much  betwixt themselves about the question we are to consider, as I do from  either of them, yet they both agree very well in this, that there is a  determinate number of such ingredients as I was just now speaking of,  and that what that number is, I say not, may be, (for what may not  such as they perswade?) but is wont to be clearly enough demonstrated  both by Reason and Experience. This has occasion'd our present  Conference. For our Discourse this afternoon, having fallen from one  subject to another, and at length setl'd on this, they proffer'd to  demonstrate to me, each of them the truth of his opinion, out of both  the Topicks that I have freshly nam'd. But on the former (that of  Reason strictly so taken) we declin'd insisting at the present, lest  we should not have time enough before supper to go thorough the  Reasons and Experiments too. The latter of which we unanimously  thought the most requisite to be seriously examin'd. I must desire you  then to take notice Gentlemen (continued _Carneades_) that my present  business doth not oblige me so to declare my own opinion on the  Subject in question, as to assert or deny the truth either of the  Peripatetick, or the Chymical Doctrine concerning the number of the  Elements, but only to shew you that neither of these Doctrines hath  been satisfactorily proved by the arguments commonly alledged on its  behalfe. So that if I really discern (as perhaps I think I do) that  there may be a more rational account then ordinary, given of one of  these opinions, I am left free to declare my self of it,  notwithstanding my present engagement, it being obvious to all your  observation, that a solid truth may be generally maintained by no  other, then incompetent Arguments. And to this Declaration I hope it  will be needless to add, that my task obliges me not to answer the  Arguments that may be drawn either for _Themistius_ or _Philoponus's_  Opinion from the Topick of reason, as opposed to experiments; since  'tis these only that I am to examine and not all these neither, but  such of them alone as either of them shall think fit to insist on, and  as have hitherto been wont to be brought either to prove that 'tis  the four Peripatetick Elements, or that 'tis the three Chymical  Principles that all compounded bodies consist of. These things (adds  _Carneades_) I thought my self obliged to premise, partly lest you  should do these Gentlemen (pointing at _Themistius_ and _Philoponus_,  and smiling on them) the injury of measuring their parts by the  arguments they are ready to propose, the lawes of our Conference  confining them to make use of those that the vulgar of Philosophers  (for even of them there is a vulgar) has drawn up to their hands; and  partly, that you should not condemn me of presumption for disputing  against persons over whom I can hope for no advantage, that _I_ must  not derive from the nature, or rules of our controversy, wherein I  have but a negative to defend, and wherein too I am like on several  occasions to have the Assistance of one of my disagreeing adversaries  against the other.    _Philoponus_ and _Themistius_ soon returned this complement with  civilities of the like nature, in which _Eleutherius_ perceiving them  engaged, to prevent the further loss of that time of which they were  not like to have very much to spare, he minded them that their  present businesse was not to exchange complements, but Arguments: and  then addressing his speech to _Carneades_, I esteem it no small  happinesse (saies he) that I am come here so luckily this Evening. For  I have been long disquieted with Doubts concerning this very subject  which you are now ready to debate. And since a Question of this  importance is to be now discussed by persons that maintain such  variety of opinions concerning it, and are both so able to enquire  after truth, and so ready to embrace it by whomsoever and on what  occasion soever it is presented them; I cannot but promise my self  that I shall before we part either lose my Doubts or the hopes of ever  finding them resolved; _Eleutherius_ paused not here; but to prevent  their answer, added almost in the same breath; and I am not a little  pleased to find that you are resolved on this occasion to insist  rather on Experiments then Syllogismes. For I, and no doubt You, have  long observed, that those Dialectical subtleties, that the Schoolmen  too often employ about Physiological Mysteries, are wont much more to  declare the wit of him that uses them, then increase the knowledge or  remove the doubts of sober lovers of truth. And such captious  subtleties do indeed often puzzle and sometimes silence men, but  rarely satisfy them. Being like the tricks of Jugglers, whereby men  doubt not but they are cheated, though oftentimes they cannot declare  by what slights they are imposed on. And therefore I think you have  done very wisely to make it your businesse to consider the _Phaenomena_  relating to the present Question, which have been afforded by  experiments, especially since it might seem injurious to our senses,  by whose mediation we acquire so much of the knowledge we have of  things corporal, to have recourse to far-fetched and abstracted  Ratiocination [Errata: Ratiocinations], to know what are the sensible  ingredients of those sensible things that we daily see and handle, and  are supposed to have the liberty to untwist (if I may so speak) into  the primitive bodies they consist of. He annexed that he wished  therefore they would no longer delay his expected satisfaction, if  they had not, as he feared they had, forgotten something preparatory  to their debate; and that was to lay down what should be all along  understood by the word Principle or Element. _Carneades_ thank'd him  for his admonition, but told him that they had not been unmindful of  so requisite a thing.

Abe was only six, but he was a thoughtful boy. He tried to think of some  way to show his gratitude to his mother for giving them so much  pleasure. While out gathering sticks and cutting wood for the big  fireplace, a happy thought came to him--he would cut off some spicewood  branches, hack them up on a log, and secrete them behind the cabin.  Then, when the mother was ready to read again, and Sarah and the father  were sitting and lying before the fire, he brought in the hidden  branches and threw them on, a few twigs at a time, to the surprise of  the others. It worked like a charm; the spicewood boughs not only added  to the brightness of the scene but filled the whole house with the  \"sweet smelling savour\" of a little boy's love and gratitude.    No one can fathom the pleasure of that precious memory throughout those  four lives, as the story of Great Heart and Christiana followed  Christian along the path that \"shineth more and more unto the perfect  day.\" While the father and sister were delighted with the crackle,  sparkle and pleasant aroma of the bits of spicewood, as Abe tossed them  upon the fire, no one could appreciate the thoughtful act of the boy so  much as his mother. It would be strange if her eyes did not fill, as she  read to her fascinated family, but that was not the sort of thing the  fondest mother could speak of.    Little did Nancy dream that, in reading to her son of the devotion of  Great Heart to his charges, she was fostering a spirit in her little son  that would help him make the noble pilgrimage from their hovel to the  highest home in the land, where another President of the United States  would refer to him as \"the Great Heart of the White House.\" If any one  could have looked ahead fifty years to see all this, and could have told  Nancy Hanks Lincoln, she would not have believed it. After her own life  of toil and hardship it would have seemed to her \"too good to be true.\"  But in the centuries following the humble yet beautiful career of \"the  Backwoods Boy\" from the hut to the White House, history keeps the whole  world saying with bated breath, \"the half was never told!\"      AN OLD MAN'S STORY OF SAVING ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S LIFE    Austin Gollaher, grown to manhood, still living in his old log cabin  near the Lincoln house in Knob Creek nearly twenty years after  Lincoln's assassination, and gave the following account of an adventure  he had with the little Lincoln boy:    \"I once saved Lincoln's life. We had been going to school together one  year; but the next year we had no school, because there were so few  scholars to attend, there being only about twenty in the school the year  before.    \"Consequently Abe and I had not much to do; but, as we did not go to  school and our mothers were strict with us, we did not get to see each  other very often. One Sunday morning my mother waked me up early, saying  she was going to see Mrs. Lincoln, and that I could go along. Glad of  the chance, I was soon dressed and ready to go. After my mother and I  got there, Abe and I played all through the day.    \"While we were wandering up and down the little stream called Knob  Creek, Abe said: 'Right up there'--pointing to the east--'we saw a covey  of partridges yesterday. Let's go over.' The stream was too wide for us  to jump across. Finally we saw a foot-log, and decided to try it. It was  narrow, but Abe said, 'Let's coon it.'    \"I went first and reached the other side all right. Abe went about half  way across, when he got scared and began trembling. I hollered to him,  'Don't look down nor up nor sideways, but look right at me and hold on  tight!' But he fell off into the creek, and, as the water was about  seven or eight feet deep (I could not swim, and neither could Abe), I  knew it would do no good for me to go in after him.    \"So I got a stick--a long water sprout--and held it out to him. He came  up, grabbing with both hands, and I put the stick into his hands. He  clung to it, and I pulled him out on the bank, almost dead. I got him by  the arms and shook him well, and then I rolled him on the ground, when  the water poured out of his mouth.    \"He was all right very soon. We promised each other that we would never  tell anybody about it, and never did for years. I never told any one of  it till after Lincoln was killed.\"    Abraham Lincoln's parents were religious in their simple way. The boy  was brought up to believe in the care of the Father in Heaven over the  affairs of this life. The family attended camp meetings and preaching  services, which were great events, because few and far between, in those  primitive days. Abe used afterward to get his playmates together and  preach to them in a way that sometimes frightened them and made them  cry.    No doubt young Lincoln learned more that was useful to him in after life  from the wandering preachers of his day than he did of his teachers  during the few months that he was permitted to go to school. But his  best teacher was his mother. She would have been proud to have her boy  grow up to be a traveling minister or exhorter, like Peter Cartwright,  \"the backwoods preacher.\"    Nancy Hanks Lincoln \"builded better than she knew.\" She would have been  satisfied with a cabin life for her son. She little knew that by her own  life and teaching she was raising up the greatest man of his age, and  one of the grandest men in all history, to become the ruler of the  greatest nation that the world has ever seen. She did her duty by her  little boy and he honored her always during her life and afterward. No  wonder he once exclaimed when he thought of her:    \"All I am or hope to be I owe to my sainted mother.\"    And out of her poor, humble life, that devoted woman    \"Gave us Lincoln and never knew!\"          CHAPTER IV    LEARNING TO WORK      The little Lincoln boy learned to help his father and mother as soon as  he could, picking berries, dropping seeds and carrying water for the men  to drink. The farm at Knob Creek seems to have been a little more  fertile than the other two places on which his father had chosen to  live.    Once while living in the White House, President Lincoln was asked if he  could remember his \"old Kentucky home.\" He replied with considerable  feeling:    \"I remember that old home very well. Our farm was composed of three  fields. It lay in the valley, surrounded by high hills and deep gorges.  Sometimes, when there came a big rain in the hills, the water would come  down through the gorges and spread all over the farm. The last thing I  remember of doing there was one Saturday afternoon; the other boys  planted the corn in what we called the big field--it contained seven  acres--and I dropped the pumpkin seed. I dropped two seeds in every  other row and every other hill. The next Sunday morning there came a big  rain in the hills--it did not rain a drop in the valley, but the water,  coming through the gorges, washed the ground, corn, pumpkin seeds and  all, clear off the field!\"    Although this was the last thing Lincoln could remember doing on that  farm, it is not at all likely that it was the last thing he did there,  for Thomas Lincoln was not the man to plant corn in a field he was about  to leave. (The Lincolns moved away in the fall.)    Another baby boy was born at Knob Creek farm; a puny, pathetic little  stranger. When this baby was about three years old, the father had to  use his skill as a cabinet maker in making a tiny coffin, and the  Lincoln family wept over a lonely little grave in the wilderness.    About this time Abe began to learn lessons in practical patriotism. Once  when Mr. Lincoln was asked what he could remember of the War of 1812, he  replied:    \"Nothing but this: I had been fishing one day and caught a little fish  which I was taking home. I met a soldier on the road, and, having been  told at home that we must be good to the soldiers, I gave him my fish.\"    An old man, Major Alexander Sympson, who lived not far from the Lincolns  at this period, left this description of \"a mere spindle of a boy,\" in  one of his earliest attempts to defend himself against odds, while  waiting at the neighboring mill while a grist was being ground.    \"He was the shyest, most reticent, most uncouth and awkward-appearing,  homeliest and worst-dressed of any in the crowd. So superlatively  wretched a butt could not hope to look on long unmolested. He was  attacked one day as he stood near a tree by a larger boy with others at  his back. But the crowd was greatly astonished when little Lincoln  soundly thrashed the first, the second, and third boy in succession; and  then, placing his back against the tree, he defied the whole crowd, and  told them they were a lot of cowards.\"    Evidently Father Tom, who enjoyed quite a reputation as a wrestler, had  give the small boy a few lessons in \"the manly art of self-defense.\"    Meanwhile the little brother and sister were learning still better  things at their mother's knee, alternately hearing and reading stories  from the Bible, \"The Pilgrim's Progress,\" \"AEsop's Fables,\" \"Robinson  Crusoe,\" and other books, common now, but rare enough in the backwoods  in those days.    There were hard times, even in the wilderness of Kentucky, after the War  of 1812. Slavery was spreading, and Thomas and Nancy Lincoln heartily  hated that \"relic of barbarism.\" To avoid witnessing its wrongs which  made it harder for self-respecting white men to rise above the class  referred to with contempt in the South as \"poor white trash,\" Tom  Lincoln determined to move farther north and west--and deeper into the  wilds.    It is sometimes stated that Abraham Lincoln belonged to the indolent  class known as \"poor whites,\" but this is not true."]]]
