[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#4)"],[1," the place of hard  work. Even the tiny prodigy has a career of work behind him, and the  master pianist has often climbed to his position over _Matterhorns_ and  _Mt. Blancs_ of industry. Days of practice, months of study, years of  struggle are part of the biography of almost every one who has attained  real greatness. What a pity to destroy time-old illusions! Some prefer  to think of their artist heroes dreaming their lives away in the hectic  cafes of Pesth or buried in the melancholy, absinthe and paresis of some  morbid cabaret of Paris. As a matter of fact, the best known pianists  live a totally different life--a life of grind, grind, grind--incessant  study, endless practice and ceaseless search for means to raise their  artistic standing. In some quiet country villa, miles away from the  center of unlicensed Bacchanalian revels, the virtuoso may be found  working hard upon next season's repertoire.    After all, the greatest thing in the artist's life is W-O-R-K.          II    ARE PIANISTS BORN OR MADE?      Some years ago the Director of the Leipsic Conservatorium gave the  writer a complete record of the number of graduates of the conservatory  from the founding to the late nineties. Of the thousands of students who  had passed through the institution only a few had gained wide  prominence. Hardly one student in one hundred had won his way into the  most voluminous of the musical biographical dictionaries. The proportion  of distinguished graduates to those who fail to gain renown is very high  at Leipsic compared with many other institutions. What becomes of the  thousands of students all working frantically with the hope of becoming  famous pianists? Surely, so much earnest effort can not be wasted even  though all can not win the race? Those who often convince themselves  that they have failed go on to perform a more useful service to society  than the laurel-crowned virtuoso. Unheralded and unapplauded, they  become the teachers, the true missionaries of _Frau Musik_ to the  people.    What is it then, which promotes a few \"fortunate\" ones from the armies  of students all over America and Europe and makes of them great  virtuosos? What must one do to become a virtuoso? How long must one  study before one may make a _debut_? What does a great virtuoso receive  for his performances? How long does the virtuoso practice each day? What  exercises does he use? All these and many more similar questions crop up  regularly in the offices of music critics and in the studios of  teachers. Unfortunately, a definite answer can be given to none,  although a great deal may be learned by reviewing some of the  experiences of one who became great.    Some virtuosos actually seem to be born with the heavenly gift. Many  indeed are sons and daughters of parents who see their own demolished  dreams realized in the triumphs of their children. When little Nathan  creeps to the piano and quite without the help of his elders picks out  the song he has heard his mother sing,--all the neighbors in Odessa know  it the next day. \"A wonder child perhaps!\" Oh happy augury of fame and  fortune! Little Nathan shall have the best of instruction. His mother  will teach him at first, of course. She will shape his little fingers to  the keyboard. She will sing sweet folk melodies in his ear,--songs of  labor, struggle, exile. She will count laboriously day after day until  he \"plays in time.\" All the while the little mother sees far beyond the  Ghetto,--out into the great world,--grand auditoriums, breathless  crowds, countless lights, nobles granting trinkets, bravos from a  thousand throats, Nathan surrounded by endless wreaths of laurel,--Oh,  it is all too much,--\"Nathan! Nathan! you are playing far too fast. One,  two, three, four,--one, two, three, four,--there, that is the tempo  Clementi would have had it. Fine! Some day, Nathan, you will be a great  pianist and--\" etc., etc.    Nathan next goes to the great teacher. He is already eight years old and  fairly leaping out of his mother's arms. Two years with the teacher and  Nathan is probably ready for a _debut_ as a wonder child. The critics  are kind. If his parents are very poor Nathan may go from town to town  for awhile being exhibited like a trained poodle or a tiny acrobat. The  further he gets from home the more severe his critics become, and Nathan  and his mother hurry back to the old teachers, who tell them that Nathan  must still practice long and hard as well as do something to build up  his general education. The world in these days looks askance at the  musician who aside from his keyboard accomplishments is a numskull. More  sacrifice for Nathan's mother and father,--but what are poverty and  deprivation with such a goal in sight? Nathan studies for some years in  the schools and in the high schools as well as at the conservatory. In  the music school he will doubtless spend six years in all,--two years in  the post-graduate or master classes, following the regular four-year  course. When sufficiently capable he will take a few pupils at a kopeck  or so per lesson to help out with the family expenses.    Nathan graduates from the conservatory with high honors. Will the public  now receive him as a great pianist? A concert is planned and Nathan  plays. Day and night for years his whole family have been looking  forward to that concert. Let us concede that the concert is a triumph.  Does he find fame and fortune waiting for him next morning? No  indeed,--there are a thousand Nathans all equally accomplished. Again he  must work and again he must concertize. Perhaps after years of strife a  manager may approach him some day with a contract. Lucky Nathan,--have  you not a thousand brothers who may never see a contract? Then,--\"Can it  be possible Nathan,--is it really America,--America the virtuoso's  Golconda!\" Nathan makes a glorious _tournee_. Perhaps the little mother  goes with him. More likely she stays at home in Odessa waiting with  glistening eyes for each incoming mail. Pupils come to Nathan and he  charges for each lesson a sum equaling his father's former weekly wage.  Away with the Ghetto! Away with poverty! Away with oblivion! Nathan is a  real virtuoso,--a veritable _Meister_!      THE AMERICAN VIRTUOSO OF TO-DAY    How does the American aspirant compete with Nathan? Are there not as  fine teachers here in America as in Europe? Is it really necessary to go  to Europe to \"finish\" one's musical education? Can one not become a  virtuoso in America?--more questions with which editors and teachers are  constantly plied. Can one who for years has waged a battle for the  American teacher and American musical education answer this question  without bias? Can we who trace the roots of our lineage back to barren  Plymouth or stolid New Netherland judge the question fairly and  honestly?    One case suffices to show the road which the American virtuoso is likely  to travel. She is still a young woman, in her twenties. Among her  teachers was one who ranks among the very best in America. Her general  education was excellent,--in fact far superior to that of the average  young lady of good family in continental Europe. While in her early  teens she became the leading feature at conservatory concerts. Her  teacher won many a profitable pupil through her brilliant playing. She  studies, as do so many American pupils, without making a regular  business of it. Compared with the six year all day, week in and week out  course which Nathan pursued in Odessa our little compatriot was at a  decided disadvantage. But who ever heard of a music student making a  regular business of learning the profession as would a doctor or a  lawyer? Have not students contented themselves with two lessons a week  since time immemorial? Need we go further to discover one of the flaws  in our own educational system,--a flaw that is not due to the teacher or  to the methods of instruction, but rather to our time-old custom. Two  lessons a week are adequate for the student who does not aspire to  become a professional, but altogether insufficient for the student who  must accomplish a vast amount of work in a comparatively small number of  years. She requires constant advice, regular daily instruction and  careful attention under experienced instructors. Teachers are not to be  blamed if she does not receive this kind of attention, as there are  abundant opportunities now in America to receive systematic training  under teachers as thorough, as able and as inspiring as may be found in  Europe. The excuse that the expense is greater in America falls when we  learn the very high prices charged by leading teachers in Germany,  Austria and France.    To go back to our particular case, the young lady is informed at the end  of a course of two or three lessons a week during two or three years,  that she is a full-fledged virtuoso and may now enter the concert field  to compete with Carreno, Bloomfield-Zeisler or Goodson. Her playing is  obviously superior to that of her contemporary students. Someone insists  upon a short course of study abroad,--not because it is necessary, but  because it might add to her reputation and make her first flights in the  American concert field more spectacular. Accordingly she goes to Europe,  only to find that she is literally surrounded by budding virtuosos,--an  army of Nathans, any one of whom might easily eclipse her. Against her  personal charm, her new-world vigor, her Yankee smartness, Nathan places  his years of systematic training, his soul saturated in the music and  art of past centuries of European endeavor and perhaps his youth of  poverty which makes success imperative. The young lady's European  teacher frankly tells her that while her playing is delightful for the  salon or parlor she will never do for the great concert hall. She must  learn to play with more power, more virility, more character.  Accordingly he sets her at work along special "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#4)"],[1,"defense,  surrendered to the Union forces Feb. 16th, and the name of Ulysses S.  Grant, as the general commanding these forces, for the first time  became known to the American people. By these victories the line of  Confederate fortifications was broken, and the enemy's means of  communication between the East and the West were destroyed.    All the historians of our civil war concede that the strategy which  made the Tennessee River the base of military operations in the  South-west, thus cutting the Confederacy in two by its control of the  Memphis and Charleston Railroad, also made its final destruction  inevitable. At an early day the Government had neither a just  conception of the rebellion, nor of the steps necessary for its  suppression. It was looked upon from a political rather than a  military point of view, and much valuable time was wasted in  suggestions and plans worse than futile. But while the national  Government had been blind to the real situation, the Confederacy had  every hour strengthened its position both at home and abroad, having  so far secured the recognition of France and England as to have been  acknowledged belligerents, while threats of raising the blockade were  also made by the same powers.    In order to a more full understanding of our national affairs at that  time, we will glance at the proceedings of Congress. When this body  met in December, 1861, a \"Committee on the Conduct of the War\" was at  once created, and spirited debates upon the situation took place in  both the Senate and the House. It was acknowledged that the salvation  of the country depended upon military success. It was declared that  the rebellion must be speedily put down or it would destroy the  resources of the country, as $2,000,000 a day were then required to  maintain the army in the field. Hon. Mr. Dawes compared the country to  a man under an exhausted receiver gasping for breath, and said that  sixty days of the present state of things must bring about an  ignominious peace. Hon. Geo. W. Julian declared that the country was  in imminent danger of a foreign war, and that in the opinion of many  the great model Republic of the world was in the throes of death. The  credit of the nation was then so poor as to render it unable to make  loans of money from foreign countries. The treasury notes issued by  the Government were falling in the market, selling at five and six per  cent. discount. Mr. Morrill, in the Senate, gave it as his opinion  that in six months the nation would be beyond hope of relief.    England was anxiously hoping for our downfall. _The London Post_, Lord  Palmerston's paper, the organ of the English Government, prophesied  our national bankruptcy within a short time. _The London Times_  denounced us in language deemed too offensive to be read before the  Senate. It urged England's direct interference; counseled the pouring  of a fleet of gun-boats through the St. Lawrence into the lakes with  the opening of spring, \"to secure, with the mastery of these waters,  the mastery of all,\" and declared that three months hence the field  would be all England's own. At that time the British Government had  already sent some thirty thousand men into its colonies in North  America, preparatory to an assault upon our north-western frontier.  The nation seemed upon the point of being lost, and the hopes of  millions of oppressed men in other lands destroyed by the  disintegration of the Union. The war had been waged six months, but  with the exception of West Virginia, the battle had been against the  Union. The fact that military success alone could turn the scale,  though now acknowledged, seemed to Congress as far as ever from  consummation. Our military commanders, quite ignorant of both the  geographical and topographical outlines of our vast country, were  unable to formulate the plan necessary for a decisive blow.    Such was the situation at the time Miss Carroll sent her plan of the  Tennessee campaign to the War Department. Fortunately for civilization  this plan was adopted, and with the fall of Fort Henry, the enemy's  center was pierced, the decisive point gained. From that hour the  nation's final success was assured. Its fall opened the Tennessee  River, and its capture was soon followed by the evacuation of Columbus  and Bowling Green. Fort Donelson was given up, its rebel garrison of  14,000 troops marched out as prisoners of war, and hope sprang up in  the hearts of the people. Pittsburg Landing and Corinth soon followed  the fate of the preceding forts. The President declared the victory at  Fort Henry to be of the utmost importance. North and South its  influence was alike felt. Gen. Beauregard was himself conscious that  this campaign sealed the fate of the \"Southern Confederacy.\" The  success of the Tennessee campaign rendered intervention impossible,  and taught those foreign enemies who were anxiously watching for our  country's downfall, the power and stability of a Republic. Missouri  was kept in the Union by its means, Tennessee and Kentucky were  restored, the National armies were enabled to push to the Gulf States  and secure possession of all the great rivers and routes of internal  communication through the heart of the Confederate territory.    On the 10th of April, 1862, the President issued the following  proclamation:         It has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe signal victories to the       land and naval forces engaged in suppressing an internal       rebellion; and at the same time to avert from our country the       damages of foreign intervention and invasion.    During all this time the author of this plan remained unknown, except  to the President and his Cabinet, who feared to reveal the fact that  the Government was proceeding under the advice and plan of a civilian,  and that civilian _a woman_. Shortly after the capture of Forts Henry  and Donelson a debate as to the author of this campaign took place in  the House of Representatives.[2] The Senate discussed its origin March  13. It was variously ascribed to the President, to the Secretary of  War, and to different naval and land commanders, Halleck, Grant,  Foote, Smith, and Fremont. The historians of the war have also given  adverse opinions as to its authorship. Draper's \"History of the Civil  War\" ascribes it to Gen. Halleck; Boynton's \"History of the Navy\" to  Commodore Foote; Lossing's \"Civil War\" to the combined wisdom of  Grant, Halleck, and Foote; Badeau's \"History of the Civil War\"  credits it to Gen. C. F. Smith; and Abbott's \"Civil War,\" to Gen.  Fremont.    But abundant testimony exists proving Miss Carroll's authorship of the  plan, in letters from Hon. B. F. Wade,[3] Chairman of the Committee on  the Conduct of the War; from Hon. Thos. A. Scott, Assistant Secretary  of War; from Hon. L. D. Evans, former Chief-Justice of the Supreme  Court of Texas (entrusted by the Government with an important secret  mission during the war); from Hon. Orestes A. Bronson, and many other  well-known public men; from conversations of President Lincoln and  Secretary Stanton; and from reports of the Military Committee of the  XLI., XLII., and XLVI. Congresses.[4] So anxious was the Government to  keep the origin of the Tennessee campaign a secret, that Col. Scott,  in conversation with Judge Evans, a personal friend of Miss Carroll,  pressed upon him the absolute necessity of Miss Carroll's making no  claim to the authorship while the struggle lasted. In the plenitude of  her self-sacrificing patriotism she remained silent, and saw the  honors rightfully belonging to her heaped upon others, although she  knew the country was indebted to her for its salvation.    Previous to 1862 historians reckoned but fifteen decisive battles[5]  in the world's history, battles in which, says Hallam, a contrary  result would have essentially varied the drama of the world in all its  subsequent scenes. Professor Cressy, of the chair of Ancient and  Modern History, University of London, has made these battles the  subject of two grand volumes. The battle of Fort Henry was the  sixteenth, and in its effects may well be deemed the most important of  all.[6] It opened the doors of liberty to the downtrodden and  oppressed among all nations, setting a seal of permanence on the  assertion that self-government is the natural right of every person.    But it was not alone through her plan of the Tennessee campaign that  Miss Carroll exhibited her military genius; throughout the conflict  she continued to send plans and suggestions to the War Department. The  events of history prove the wisdom of those plans, and that had they  been strictly followed, the war would have been brought to a speedy  close,[7] and millions of men and money saved to the country.    Upon the fall of Fort Henry, February, 1862, she again addressed the  War Department, advising an immediate advance upon Mobile or  Vicksburg. In March, 1862, she presented a memorial and maps to  Secretary Stanton in person, in regard to the reduction of Island 10,  which had long been a vain effort by the Union forces, in which she  said:         The failure to take Island 10, which thus far occasions much       disappointment to the country, excites no surprise to me. When I       looked at the gun-boats at St. Louis, and was informed as to       their powers, and that the current of the Mississippi at full       tide runs at the rate of five miles per hour, which is very near       the speed of our gun-boats, I could not resist the conclusion       that they were not well fitted to the taking of batteries on the       Mississippi River, if assisted by gun-boats perhaps equal to our       own. Hence it was that I wrote Col. Scott from there, that the       Tennessee River was our strategic point, and the successes at       Forts Henry and Donelson establish the justice of these       observations. Had our victorious army, after the fall of Fort       Henry,"]]]
