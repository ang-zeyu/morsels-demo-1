It is not confined  to any particular time, since the animal can delay it according to  circumstances, even when the paunch is quite full. It has been expressly  stated of some men, who have had the power of ruminating, that it was  quite voluntary with them. Blumenbach knew four men who ruminated their  food, and they assured him they had a real enjoyment in doing it: two of  them had the power of doing or abstaining from it at their pleasure.    A case of human rumination occurred some years ago at Bristol, the  particulars of which are minutely recorded in the 'Philosophical  Transactions.' It seemed, in this instance, to have been hereditary, as  the father of the individual was subject to the same habit. The young  man usually began to chew his food over again, within a quarter of an  hour after eating. His ruminating after a full meal generally lasted  about an hour and a half; nor could he sleep until this task was  completed. The victuals, upon its return, tasted even more pleasantly  than at first; and seemed as if it had been beaten up in a mortar. If he  ate a variety of things, that which he ate first, came up again first;  and if this return was interrupted for any length of time, it produced  sickness and disorder; nor was he ever well till it returned. These  singular cases are caused, no doubt, by some abnormal structure of the  interior of the stomach. No account has yet been given of the dissection  of an individual so constituted.    When cattle are at rest, or not employed in grazing or chewing the cud,  they are observed frequently to lick themselves. By this means they  raise up the hair of their coats, and often swallow it in considerable  quantities. The hair thus swallowed gradually accumulates in the  stomach, where it is formed into smooth round balls, which, in time,  become invested with a hardish brown crust, composed, apparently, of  inspissated mucilage, that, by continual friction from the coats of the  stomach, becomes hard and glossy. It is generally in the paunch that  these hair-balls are found. They vary in weight from a few ounces to six  or seven pounds. Mr. Walton, author of an 'Account of the Peruvian  Sheep,' makes mention of one that he had in his possession which weighed  eight pounds and a quarter. This hair-ball had been taken from a cow  that fed on the Pampas of Buenos Ayres. It was of a flat circular shape,  and measured two feet eleven inches and a half in circumference; two  feet eight inches round the flat part; nine inches diameter also in the  flat part; eleven inches diameter in the cross part; and, on immersing  it in water, it displaced upwards of eight quarts, which made its bulk  correspond to 462 cubic inches. The digestive functions are sometimes  seriously impaired by these concretions; a loss of appetite ensues, and  general debility.    In the Museum of Daniel Crosthwaite, there is a very extraordinary ball  of hair, taken from a fatted calf only seven weeks old. The ball of  hair, when taken out of the animal's stomach, and full of moisture,  weighed eleven ounces. The calf was fatted by Daniel Thwaite, of Dale  Head Hall, within six miles of Keswick; and slaughtered by John Fisher,  butcher, Keswick. The calf was a particularly healthy animal.    Before closing this brief sketch of the digestive apparatus of the ox,  it may not be uninteresting to quote some of the quaint speculations of  Nathaniel Grew on this subject, from his 'Comparative Anatomy of  Stomachs and Guts.'    He says: \"The _voluntary_ motion of the stomach is that only which  accompanies rumination. That it is truly voluntary, is clear, from the  command that ruminating animals have of that action. For this purpose it  is, that the muscules of their venters are so thick and strong; and have  several duplicatures, as the bases of those muscules, whereupon the  stress of their motion lies. By means whereof they are able with ease to  rowl and tumble any part of the meat from one cell of the same venter to  another; or from one venter to another; or from thence into the gullet,  whensoever they are minded to do it; so that the ejectment of the meat,  in rumination, is a voluntary eructation.    \"The pointed knots, like little papillae, in the stomachs of ruminating  beasts, are also of great use, namely, for the tasting of the meat. The  inner membrane of the first three venters is fibrous (like the gustatory  papillae of the tongue) and not glandulous; the fourth only being  glandulous, as in a man. Of the fibres of this membrane, and the  nervous, are composed those pointed knots, which are, both in substance  and shape, altogether like to those upon the tongue. Whence I doubt not,  but that the said three ventricles, as they have a power of voluntary  motion, so, likewise, that they are the seat of taste, and as truly the  organs of that sense, as is the tongue itself.\"    [Illustration: Skull of Domestic Ox, from a specimen in the Royal  College of Surgeons.]    The mouth of animals of the Ox Tribe contains, when full, thirty-two  teeth. Six molars in each jaw, above, below, and on either side; and  eight incisors in the lower jaw. In the upper jaw there are no  incisors; but instead thereof a fibrous and elastic pad, or cushion,  which covers the convex extremity of the anterior maxillary bone, and  which is well worthy of observation.    The final cause of this pad (which stands in the place of upper incisor  teeth) and the part it plays in the procuring of food, is thus described  by Youatt. \"The grass is collected and rolled together by means of the  long and moveable tongue; it is firmly held between the lower cutting  teeth and the pad, the cartilaginous upper lip assisting in this; and  then by a sudden nodding motion of the head, the little roll of herbage  is either torn or cut off, or partly both torn and cut.    \"The intention of this singular method of gathering the food, it is  somewhat difficult satisfactorily to explain. It is peculiar to  ruminants, who have one large stomach, in which the food is kept as a  kind of reservoir until it is ready for the action of the other  stomachs. While it is kept there it is in a state of maceration; it is  exposed to the united influence of moisture and warmth, and the  consequence of this is, that a species of decomposition sometimes  commences, and a vast deal of gas is extricated.    \"That this should not take place in the natural process of retention and  maceration, nature possibly established this mechanism for the first  gathering of the food. It is impossible that half of that which is thus  procured can be fairly cut through; part will be torn, and no little  portion will be torn up by the roots. If cattle are observed while they  are grazing, it will be seen that many a root mingles with the blades of  grass; and these roots have sometimes no inconsiderable quantity of  earth about them. The beast, however, seems not to regard this; he eats  on, dirt and all, until his paunch is filled.    \"It was designed that this earth should be gathered and swallowed; it  was the meaning of this mechanism. A portion of absorbent earth is found  in every soil, sufficient not only to prevent the evil that would result  from occasional decomposition, by neutralizing the acid principle as  rapidly as it is evolved; but, perhaps, by its presence, preventing that  decomposition from taking place. Hence the eagerness with which  stall-fed cattle, who have not the opportunity of plucking up the roots  of grass, evince for mould. It is seldom that a cow will pass a  newly-raised mole hill without nuzzling into it, and devouring a  considerable portion of it. This is particularly the case where there is  any degree of indigestion.\"    The general disposition of animals of this class, when unmolested, is  inoffensive and retiring; but when excited and irritated, they are  fierce and courageous, and extremely dangerous to encounter. It is a  remarkable circumstance in their history, that they are generally  provoked to attack at the sight of red, or any very bright and glaring  colour.

THE AMERICAN BISON.    _Bos Americanus._      [Illustration: THE BISON. ]    The head of this animal is enormously large; larger, in fact, in  proportion to the size of its body, than that of any other species of  the Ox Tribe. This huge head is supported by very powerful muscles,  attached to the projecting spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae; and  these muscles, together with a quantity of fat, constitute the hump on  the shoulders. The horns are short, tapering, round, and very distant  from each other, as are also the eyes, which are small and dark. The  head, neck, shoulders, and fore-legs, to the knee-joints, are covered  with long woolly hair, which likewise forms a beard under the mouth.

Under  the head of Botany no book has been of greater service than  Maiden's <i>Useful Native Plants</i>.  Unfortunately many  scientific men scorn vernacular names, but Mr. Maiden has taken  the utmost pains with them, and has thereby largely increased  the utility of his volume.  For Tasmania there is Mr. Spicer's  <i>Handbook of Tasmanian Plants</i>; for New Zealand, Kirk's  <i>Forest Flora</i> and Hooker's <i>Botany</i>.    For Australian animals Lydekker's <i>Marsupials and  Monotremes</i> is excellent; especially his section on the  Phalanger or Australian <i>Opossum</i>, an animal which has  been curiously neglected by all Dictionaries of repute.  On New  Zealand mammals it is not necessary to quote any book; for when  the English came, it is said, New Zealand contained no mammal  larger than a rat.  Captain Cook turned two pigs loose; but it  is stated on authority, that these pigs left no descendants.  One was ridden to death by Maori boys, and the other was killed  for sacrilege: he rooted in a tapu burial-place.  Nevertheless,  the settlers still call any wild-pig, especially if lean and  bony, a \"Captain Cook.\"    For the scientific nomenclature of Australian Botany the  <i>Census of Australian Plants</i> by the Baron von Mueller  (1889) is indispensable.  It has been strictly followed.  For  fishes reliance has been placed upon Tenison Woods' <i>Fishes  and Fisheries of New South Wales</i> (1882), on W. Macleay's  <i>Descriptive Catalogue of Australian Fishes</i> (Proceedings  of the Linnaean Society of New South Wales, vols. v. and vi.),  and on Dr. Guenther's <i>Study of Fishes</i>.  For the  scientific nomenclature of Animal Life, the standard of  reference has been the <i>Tabular List of all the Australian  Birds</i> by E. P. Ramsay of the Australian Museum, Sydney  (1888); <i>Catalogue of Australian Mammals</i> by J. O. Ogilby  of the Australian Museum, Sydney (1892); <i>Catalogue of  Marsupials and Monotremes</i>, British Museum (1888);  <i>Prodromus to the Natural History of Victoria</i> by Sir  F. McCoy.  Constant reference has also been made to Proceedings  of the Linnaean Society of New South Wales, Proceedings and  Transactions of the Royal Societies of Victoria and Tasmania,  and to the journal of the Field Naturalist Club of Victoria.    The birds both in Australia and New Zealand have been  handsomely treated by the scientific illustrators.  Gould's  <i>Birds of Australia</i> and Buller's <i>Birds of New  Zealand</i> are indeed monumental works.  Neither Gould nor Sir  Walter Buller scorns vernacular names.  But since the days of  the former the number of named species of Australian birds has  largely increased, and in January 1895, at the Brisbane Meeting  of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,  a Committee was appointed to draw up a list of vernacular  bird-names.  By the kindness of a member of this Committee  (Mr. A. J. Campbell of Melbourne) I was allowed the use of a  list of such vernacular names drawn up by him and Col. Legge  for submission to the Committee.        VIII.  SCIENTIFIC WORDS.      The example of <i>The Century</i> has been followed in the  inclusion of sundry scientific names, especially those of  genera or Natural Orders of purely Australasian objects.  Although it is quite true that these can hardly be described as  Australasian <i>English</i>, it is believed that the course  adopted will be for the general convenience of those who  consult this Dictionary.    Some of these \"Neo-Latin\" and \"Neo-Greek\" words are  extraordinary in themselves and obscure in their origin, though  not through antiquity.  In his <i>Student's Pastime</i>, at  p. 293, Dr. Skeat says \"Nowhere can more ignorant etymologies  be found than in works on Botany and `scientific' subjects.  Too often, all the science is reserved for the subject, so that  there is none to spare for explaining the names.\"    A generous latitude has also been taken in including some words  undoubtedly English, but not exclusively Australasian, such as  <i>Anabranch</i>, and <i>Antipodes</i>, and some mining and  other terms that are also used in the United States.  Convenience of readers is the excuse.  <i>Anabranch</i> is more  frequently used of Australian rivers than of any others, but  perhaps a little pride in tracking the origin of the word has  had something to do with its inclusion.  Some words have been  inserted for purposes of explanation, e.g. <i>Snook</i>, in  Australasia called <i>Barracouta</i>, which latter is itself an  old name applied in Australasia to a different fish; and  <i>Cavally</i>, which is needed to explain <i>Trevally</i>.        IX. ASSISTANCE RECEIVED.      There remains the pleasant duty of acknowledging help.  Many  persons have given me help, whose names can hardly be listed  here.  A friend, an acquaintance, or sometimes even a stranger,  has often sent a single quotation of value, or an explanation  of a single word.  The Editors of many newspapers have helped  not a little by the insertion of a letter or a circular.  To  all these helpers, and I reckon their number at nearly 200, I  tender my hearty thanks.    Various officers of the Melbourne Public Library, and my friend  Mr. Edward H. Bromby, the Librarian of this University, have  rendered me much assistance.  I have often been fortunate  enough to obtain information from the greatest living authority  on a particular subject: from the Baron von Mueller, from Sir  Frederick M'Coy, or from Mr. A. W. Howitt.  [Alas! since I  penned this sentence, the kind and helpful Baron has been taken  from us, and is no longer the greatest living authority on  Australian Botany.]  My friend and colleague, Professor Baldwin  Spencer, a most earnest worker in the field of Australian  science, gave many hours of valuable time to set these pages  right in the details of scientific explanations.  Mr. J. G. Luehmann of Melbourne has kindly answered various  questions about Botany, and Mr. A. J. North, of Sydney, in  regard to certain birds.  Mr. T. S. Hall, of the Biological  Department of this University, and Mr. J. J. Fletcher, of  Sydney, the Secretary of the Linnaean Society of New South  Wales, have rendered me much help.  The Rev. John Mathew, of  Coburg, near Melbourne, has thrown much light on aboriginal  words.  The Rev. E. H. Sugden, Master of Queen's College in  this University, has furnished a large number of useful  quotations.  His name is similarly mentioned, <i>honoris  causa</i>, in Dr. Murray's Preface to Part I. of the `O. E. D.'  Mr. R. T. Elliott of Worcester College, Oxford, has given  similar help.  The Master himself,--the Master of all who  engage in Dictionary work,--Dr. Murray, of Oxford, has kindly  forwarded to me a few pithy and valuable comments on my  proof-streets.  He also made me a strong appeal never to pass  on information from any source without acknowledgment.  This,  the only honest course, I have striven scrupulously to follow;  but it is not always easy to trace the sources whence  information has been derived.    When gaps in the sequence of quotations were especially  apparent on the proofs, Mr. W. Ellis Bird, of Richmond,  Victoria, found me many illustrative passages.  For New Zealand  words a goodly supply of quotations was contributed by Miss  Mary Colborne-Veel of Christchurch, author of a volume of  poetry called <i>The Fairest of the Angels</i>, by her sister,  Miss Gertrude Colborne-Veel, and by Mr. W. H. S. Roberts of  Oamaru, author of a little book called <i>Southland in</i>  1856.  In the matter of explanation of the origin and meaning  of New Zealand terms, Dr. Hocken of Dunedin, Mr. F. R. Chapman  of the same city, and Mr. Edward Tregear of Wellington, author  of the <i>Maori Polynesian Dictionary</i>, and Secretary of the  Polynesian Society, have rendered valuable and material  assistance.  Dr. Holden of Bellerive, near Hobart, was perhaps  my most valued correspondent.  After I had failed in one or two  quarters to enlist Tasmanian sympathy, he came to the rescue,  and gave me much help on Tasmanian words, especially on the  Flora and the birds; also on Queensland Flora and on the whole  subject of Fishes.  Dr. Holden also enlisted later the help of  Mr. J. B. Walker, of Hobart, who contributed much to enrich my  proofs.  But the friend who has given me most help of all has  been Mr. J. Lake of St. John's College, Cambridge.  When the  Dictionary was being prepared for press, he worked with me for  some months, very loyally putting my materials into shape.  Birds, Animals, and Botany he sub-edited for me, and much of  the value of this part of the Book, which is almost an  Encyclopaedia rather than a Dictionary, is due to his ready  knowledge, his varied attainments, and his willingness to  undertake research.    To all who have thus rendered me assistance I tender hearty  thanks.  It is not their fault if, as is sure to be the case,  defects and mistakes are found in this Dictionarv.  But should  the Book be received with public favour, these shall be  corrected in a later edition.    EDWARD E. MORRIS.
