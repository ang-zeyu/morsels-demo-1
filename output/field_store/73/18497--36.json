Gigantic Africans bore the litter and moved on, preceded by slaves  called pedisequii. Petronius, after some time, raised to his nostrils  in silence his palm odorous with verbena, and seemed to be meditating on  something.    \"It occurs to me,\" said he after a while, \"that if thy forest goddess is  not a slave she might leave the house of Plautius, and transfer herself  to thine. Thou wouldst surround her with love and cover her with wealth,  as I do my adored Chrysothemis, of whom, speaking between us, I have  quite as nearly enough as she has of me.\"    Marcus shook his head.    \"No?\" inquired Petronius. \"In the worst event, the case would be left  with Caesar, and thou mayst be certain that, thanks even to my influence,  our Bronzebeard would be on thy side.\"    \"Thou knowest not Lygia,\" replied Vinicius.    \"Then permit me to ask if thou know her otherwise than by sight? Hast  spoken with her? hast confessed thy love to her?\"    \"I saw her first at the fountain; since then I have met her twice.  Remember that during my stay in the house of Aulus, I dwelt in a  separate villa, intended for guests, and, having a disjointed arm, I  could not sit at the common table. Only on the eve of the day for which  I announced my departure did I meet Lygia at supper, but I could not  say a word to her. I had to listen to Aulus and his account of victories  gained by him in Britain, and then of the fall of small states in Italy,  which Licinius Stolo strove to prevent. In general I do not know whether  Aulus will be able to speak of aught else, and do not think that we  shall escape this history unless it be thy wish to hear about the  effeminacy of these days. They have pheasants in their preserves, but  they do not eat them, setting out from the principle that every pheasant  eaten brings nearer the end of Roman power. I met her a second time at  the garden cistern, with a freshly plucked reed in her hand, the top of  which she dipped in the water and sprinkled the irises growing around.  Look at my knees. By the shield of Hercules, I tell thee that they  did not tremble when clouds of Parthians advanced on our maniples with  howls, but they trembled before the cistern. And, confused as a youth  who still wears a bulla on his neck, I merely begged pity with my eyes,  not being able to utter a word for a long time.\"    Petronius looked at him, as if with a certain envy. \"Happy man,\" said  he, \"though the world and life were the worst possible, one thing in  them will remain eternally good,--youth!\"    After a while he inquired: \"And hast thou not spoken to her?\"    \"When I had recovered somewhat, I told her that I was returning from  Asia, that I had disjointed my arm near the city, and had suffered  severely, but at the moment of leaving that hospitable house I saw that  suffering in it was more to be wished for than delight in another place,  that sickness there was better than health somewhere else. Confused  too on her part, she listened to my words with bent head while drawing  something with the reed on the saffron-colored sand. Afterward she  raised her eyes, then looked down at the marks drawn already; once  more she looked at me, as if to ask about something, and then fled on a  sudden like a hamadryad before a dull faun.\"    \"She must have beautiful eyes.\"    \"As the sea--and I was drowned in them, as in the sea. Believe me that  the archipelago is less blue. After a while a little son of Plautius ran  up with a question. But I did not understand what he wanted.\"    \"O Athene!\" exclaimed Petronius, \"remove from the eyes of this youth the  bandage with which Eros has bound them; if not, he will break his head  against the columns of Venus's temple.    \"O thou spring bud on the tree of life,\" said he, turning to Vinicius,  \"thou first green shoot of the vine! Instead of taking thee to the  Plautiuses, I ought to give command to bear thee to the house of  Gelocius, where there is a school for youths unacquainted with life.\"    \"What dost thou wish in particular?\"    \"But what did she write on the sand? Was it not the name of Amor, or a  heart pierced with his dart, or something of such sort, that one might  know from it that the satyrs had whispered to the ear of that nymph  various secrets of life? How couldst thou help looking on those marks?\"    \"It is longer since I have put on the toga than seems to thee,\" said  Vinicius, \"and before little Aulus ran up, I looked carefully at those  marks, for I know that frequently maidens in Greece and in Rome draw on  the sand a confession which their lips will not utter. But guess what  she drew!\"    \"If it is other than I supposed, I shall not guess.\"    \"A fish.\"    \"What dost thou say?\"    \"I say, a fish. What did that mean,--that cold blood is flowing in her  veins? So far I do not know; but thou, who hast called me a spring bud  on the tree of life, wilt be able to understand the sign certainly.\"    \"Carissime! ask such a thing of Pliny. He knows fish. If old Apicius  were alive, he could tell thee something, for in the course of his  life he ate more fish than could find place at one time in the bay of  Naples.\"    Further conversation was interrupted, since they were borne into crowded  streets where the noise of people hindered them.    From the Vicus Apollinis they turned to the Boarium, and then entered  the Forum Romanum, where on clear days, before sunset, crowds of idle  people assembled to stroll among the columns, to tell and hear news, to  see noted people borne past in litters, and finally to look in at the  jewellery-shops, the book-shops, the arches where coin was changed,  shops for silk, bronze, and all other articles with which the buildings  covering that part of the market placed opposite the Capitol were  filled.    One-half of the Forum, immediately under the rock of the Capitol, was  buried already in shade; but the columns of the temples, placed higher,  seemed golden in the sunshine and the blue. Those lying lower cast  lengthened shadows on marble slabs. The place was so filled with columns  everywhere that the eye was lost in them as in a forest.    Those buildings and columns seemed huddled together. They towered some  above others, they stretched toward the right and the left, they climbed  toward the height, and they clung to the wall of the Capitol, or some  of them clung to others, like greater and smaller, thicker and thinner,  white or gold colored tree-trunks, now blooming under architraves,  flowers of the acanthus, now surrounded with Ionic corners, now finished  with a simple Doric quadrangle. Above that forest gleamed colored  triglyphs; from tympans stood forth the sculptured forms of gods; from  the summits winged golden quadrigae seemed ready to fly away through  space into the blue dome, fixed serenely above that crowded place of  temples. Through the middle of the market and along the edges of it  flowed a river of people; crowds passed under the arches of the basilica  of Julius Caesar; crowds were sitting on the steps of Castor and Pollux,  or walking around the temple of Vesta, resembling on that great marble  background many-colored swarms of butterflies or beetles. Down immense  steps, from the side of the temple on the Capitol dedicated to Jupiter  Optimus Maximus, came new waves; at the rostra people listened to chance  orators; in one place and another rose the shouts of hawkers selling  fruit, wine, or water mixed with fig-juice; of tricksters; of venders  of marvellous medicines; of soothsayers; of discoverers of hidden  treasures; of interpreters of dreams. Here and there, in the tumult of  conversations and cries, were mingled sounds of the Egyptian sistra, of  the sambuke, or of Grecian flutes. Here and there the sick, the pious,  or the afflicted were bearing offerings to the temples. In the midst of  the people, on the stone flags, gathered flocks of doves, eager for  the grain given them, and like movable many-colored and dark spots, now  rising for a moment with a loud sound of wings, now dropping down again  to places left vacant by people. From time to time the crowds opened  before litters in which were visible the affected faces of women, or  the heads of senators and knights, with features, as it were, rigid and  exhausted from living. The many-tongued population repeated aloud their  names, with the addition of some term of praise or ridicule. Among  the unordered groups pushed from time to time, advancing with measured  tread, parties of soldiers, or watchers, preserving order on the  streets. Around about, the Greek language was heard as often as Latin.    Vinicius, who had not been in the city for a long time, looked with a  certain curiosity on that swarm of people and on that Forum Romanum,  which both dominated the sea of the world and was flooded by it, so that  Petronius, who divined the thoughts of his companion, called it \"the  nest of the Quirites--without the Quirites.\" In truth, the local element  was well-nigh lost in that crowd, composed of all races and nations.  There appeared Ethiopians, gigantic light-haired people from the distant  north, Britons, Gauls, Germans, sloping-eyed dwellers of Lericum; people  from the Euphrates and from the Indus, with beards dyed brick color;  Syrians from the banks of the Orontes, with black and mild eyes;  dwellers in the deserts of Arabia, dried up as a bone; Jews, with their  flat breasts; Egyptians, with the eternal, indifferent smile on their  faces; Numidians and Africans; Greeks from Hellas, who equally with the  Romans commanded the city, but commanded through science, art, wisdom,  and deceit; Greeks from the islands, from Asia Minor, from Egypt, from  Italy, from Narbonic Gaul. In the throng of slaves, with pierced ears,  were not lacking also freemen,--an idle population, which Caesar amused,  supported, even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#4)"],[1,"thousand proverbs:       and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees,       from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop       that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and       of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. And there came       of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of       the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.\"    The tradition of his great eminence in scientific research is also  preserved in the words put into his mouth in the Book of the Wisdom of  Solomon, now included in the Apocrypha.         \"For\" (God) \"Himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the       things that are, to know the constitution of the world, and       the operation of the elements; the beginning and end and       middle of times, the alternations of the solstices and the       changes of seasons, the circuits of years and the positions\"       (_margin_, constellations) \"of stars; the natures of living       creatures and the ragings of wild beasts, the violences of       winds and the thoughts of men, the diversities of plants and       the virtues of roots: all things that are either secret or       manifest I learned, for she that is the artificer of all       things taught me, even Wisdom.\"    Two great names have impressed themselves upon every part of the  East:--the one, that of Solomon the son of David, as the master of every  secret source of knowledge; and the other that of Alexander the Great,  as the mightiest of conquerors. It is not unreasonable to believe that  the traditions respecting the first have been founded upon as real a  basis of actual achievement as those respecting the second.    But to such scientific achievements we have no express allusion in  Scripture, other than is afforded us by the two quotations just made.  Natural objects, natural phenomena are not referred to for their own  sake. Every thought leads up to God or to man's relation to Him.  Nature, as a whole and in its every aspect and detail, is the handiwork  of Jehovah: that is the truth which the heavens are always  declaring;--and it is His power, His wisdom, and His goodness to man  which it is sought to illustrate, when the beauty or wonder of natural  objects is described.         \"When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers,        The moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained;        What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?        And the son of man, that Thou visitest him?\"    The first purpose, therefore, of the following study of the astronomy of  the Bible is,--not to reconstruct the astronomy of the Hebrews, a task  for which the material is manifestly incomplete,--but to examine such  astronomical allusions as occur with respect to their appropriateness to  the lesson which the writer desired to teach. Following this, it will be  of interest to examine what connection can be traced between the Old  Testament Scriptures and the Constellations; the arrangement of the  stars into constellations having been the chief astronomical work  effected during the centuries when those Scriptures were severally  composed. The use made of the heavenly bodies as time-measurers amongst  the Hebrews will form a third division of the subject; whilst there are  two or three incidents in the history of Israel which appear to call for  examination from an astronomical point of view, and may suitably be  treated in a fourth and concluding section.      FOOTNOTES:    [7:1] _Astronomy in the Old Testament_, p. 12.          CHAPTER II    THE CREATION      A few years ago a great eclipse of the sun, seen as total along a broad  belt of country right across India, drew thither astronomers from the  very ends of the earth. Not only did many English observers travel  thither, but the United States of America in the far west, and Japan in  the far east sent their contingents, and the entire length of country  covered by the path of the shadow was dotted with the temporary  observatories set up by the men of science.    It was a wonderful sight that was vouchsafed to these travellers in  pursuit of knowledge. In a sky of unbroken purity, undimmed even for a  moment by haze or cloud, there shone down the fierce Indian sun.  Gradually a dark mysterious circle invaded its lower edge, and covered  its brightness; coolness replaced the burning heat; slowly the dark  covering crept on; slowly the sunlight diminished until at length the  whole of the sun's disc was hidden. Then in a moment a wonderful  starlike form flashed out, a noble form of glowing silver light on the  deep purple-coloured sky.    There was, however, no time for the astronomers to devote to admiration  of the beauty of the scene, or indulgence in rhapsodies. Two short  minutes alone were allotted them to note all that was happening, to take  all their photographs, to ask all the questions, and obtain all the  answers for which this strange veiling of the sun, and still stranger  unveiling of his halo-like surroundings, gave opportunity. It was two  minutes of intensest strain, of hurried though orderly work; and then a  sudden rush of sunlight put an end to all. The mysterious vision had  withdrawn itself; the colour rushed back to the landscape, so  corpse-like whilst in the shadow; the black veil slid rapidly from off  the sun; the heat returned to the air; the eclipse was over.    But the astronomers from distant lands were not the only people engaged  in watching the eclipse. At their work, they could hear the sound of a  great multitude, a sound of weeping and wailing, a people dismayed at  the distress of their god.    It was so at every point along the shadow track, but especially where  that track met the course of the sacred river. Along a hundred roads the  pilgrims had poured in unceasing streams towards Holy Mother Gunga;  towards Benares, the sacred city; towards Buxar, where the eclipse was  central at the river bank. It is always meritorious--so the Hindoo  holds--to bathe in that sacred river, but such a time as this, when the  sun is in eclipse, is the most propitious moment of all for such  lustration.    Could there be a greater contrast than that offered between the millions  trembling and dismayed at the signs of heaven, and the little companies  who had come for thousands of miles over land and sea, rejoicing in the  brief chance that was given them for learning a little more of the  secrets of the wonders of Nature?    The contrast between the heathen and the scientists was in both their  spiritual and their intellectual standpoint, and, as we shall see later,  the intellectual contrast is a result of the spiritual. The heathen idea  is that the orbs of heaven are divine, or at least that each expresses a  divinity. This does not in itself seem an unnatural idea when we  consider the great benefits that come to us through the instrumentality  of the sun and moon. It is the sun that morning by morning rolls back  the darkness, and brings light and warmth and returning life to men; it  is the sun that rouses the earth after her winter sleep and quickens  vegetation. It is the moon that has power over the great world of  waters, whose pulse beats in some kind of mysterious obedience to her  will.    Natural, then, has it been for men to go further, and to suppose that  not only is power lodged in these, and in the other members of the  heavenly host, but that it is living, intelligent, personal power; that  these shining orbs are beings, or the manifestations of beings; exalted,  mighty, immortal;--that they are gods.    But if these are gods, then it is sacrilegious, it is profane, to treat  them as mere \"things\"; to observe them minutely in the microscope or  telescope; to dissect them, as it were, in the spectroscope; to identify  their elements in the laboratory; to be curious about their properties,  influences, relations, and actions on each other.    And if these are gods, there are many gods, not One God. And if there  are many gods, there are many laws, not one law. Thus scientific  observations cannot be reconciled with polytheism, for scientific  observations demand the assumption of one universal law. The wise king  expressed this law thus:--    \"The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be.\" The actual  language of science, as expressed by Professor Thiele, a leading  Continental astronomer, states that--         \"Everything that exists, and everything that happens, exists       or happens as a necessary consequence of a previous state of       things. If a state of things is repeated in every detail, it       must lead to exactly the same consequences. Any difference       between the results of causes that are in part the same, must       be explainable by some difference in the other part of the       causes.\"[15:1]         The law stated in the above words has been called the Law of       Causality. It \"cannot be proved, but must be believed; in the       same way as we believe the fundamental assumptions of       religion, with which it is closely and intimately connected.       The law of causality forces itself upon our belief. It may be       denied in theory, but not in practice. Any person who denies       it, will, if he is watchful enough, catch himself constantly       asking himself, if no one else, why _this_ has happened, and       not _that_. But in that very question he bears witness to the       law of causality. If we are consistently to deny the law of       causality, we must repudiate all observation, and particularly       all prediction based on past experience, as useless and       misleading.         \"If we could imagine for an instant that the same complete       combination of causes could have a definite number of       different consequences, however small that number might be,       and that among these the occurrence of the actual consequence       was, in the old sense of the word, accidental, no observation"]]]
