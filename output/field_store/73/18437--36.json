The Government of the United  States would consider it a privilege thus to serve its friends and the  world. It stands ready at any time to convey to either Government any  intimation or suggestion the other may be willing to have it convey  and cordially invites the Imperial German Government to make use of  its services in this way at its convenience. The whole world is  concerned in anything that may bring about even a partial  accommodation of interests or in any way mitigate the terrors of the  present distressing conflict.    In the meantime, whatever arrangement may happily be made between the  parties to the war, and whatever may in the opinion of the Imperial  German Government have been the provocation or the circumstantial  justification for the past acts of its commanders at sea, the  Government of the United States confidently looks to see the justice  and humanity of the Government of Germany vindicated in all cases  where Americans have been wronged or their rights as neutrals invaded.    The Government of the United States therefore very earnestly and very  solemnly renews the representations of its note transmitted to the  Imperial German Government on the 15th of May, and relies in these  representations upon the principles of humanity, the universally  recognized understandings of international law, and the ancient  friendship of the German Nation.    The Government of the United States cannot admit that the proclamation  of a war zone from which neutral ships have been warned to keep away  may be made to operate as in any degree an abbreviation of the rights  either of American shipmasters or of American citizens bound on lawful  errands as passengers on merchant ships of belligerent nationality. It  does not understand the Imperial German Government to question those  rights. It understands it, also, to accept as established beyond  question the principle that the lives of non combatants cannot  lawfully or rightfully be put in jeopardy by the capture or  destruction of an unresisting merchantman, and to recognize the  obligation to take sufficient precaution to ascertain whether a  suspected merchantman is in fact of belligerent nationality or is in  fact carrying contraband of war under a neutral flag. The Government  of the United States therefore deems it reasonable to expect that the  Imperial German Government will adopt the measures necessary to put  these principles into practice in respect of the safeguarding of  American lives and American ships, and asks for assurances that this  will be done.    ROBERT LANSING,  Secretary of State ad Interim.          THE LUSITANIA'S \"GUNS\"      _In a Washington dispatch of June 2, 1915, to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES,  _the following report appeared:_    In his conversation with President Wilson today the German Ambassador  said that he had obtained evidence through means of affidavits that  the Lusitania was an armed vessel, as asserted by the German  Government. The affidavits to which Count von Bernstorff referred have  been placed in possession of the State Department, which has turned  them over to the Department of Justice for an investigation as to the  statements sworn to and the character of the individuals making them.    [Illustration: HIS EXCELLENCY COUNT JOHANN VON BERNSTORFF    German Ambassador to the United States]    One of the affidavits is made by Gustav Stahl of 20 Leroy Street, New  York City. He says:         On the day prior to the sailing of the Lusitania, I was       asked by my friend, A. Lietch, who was employed as first       cabin steward, to help him to bring his trunk aboard. In the       course of the evening we went on board, without being       hindered by the quartermaster on guard. After having       remained some time in the \"gloria,\" (steward's quarters,) we       went to the stern main deck. About fifteen to eighteen feet       from the entrance to the \"gloria,\" on port and starboard,       respectively, I saw two guns of twelve to fifteen       centimeters. They were covered with leather, but the barrel       was distinctly to be seen. To satisfy my curiosity I       unfastened the buckles to ascertain the calibre of the guns.       I could also ascertain that the guns were mounted on deck on       wooden blocks. The guns were placed about three feet from       the respective ship sides and the wall could be removed at       that particular place.         On the foredeck there were also two guns of the same calibre       and covered in the same manner. They were placed at about       fifteen to twenty feet from the entrance of the crew's       quarters, and four feet from the ship side, where the wall       could also be removed.    Josephine Weir, who describes herself as a New York boarding house  keeper, provided another affidavit. She swore that Lietch, who is  named in Stahl's statement, told her he was to sail on the Lusitania  as a steward, and when she spoke of the danger from German submarines,  he said:    \"Oh, I am not afraid. We have four big brightly polished copper guns.\"    A man named Grieve has an affidavit that he heard Lietch make this  statement to Mrs. Weir.    In an affidavit furnished by one Bruckner it is stated that he saw a  cannon on the Lusitania. He was standing on the dock in New York at  the time, he avers.    The affidavits were supplied to the State Department by the German  Embassy in order to support the allegation, contained in the German  response to President Wilson's note of May 13, that the Lusitania was  an armed vessel.      By The Associated Press.    WASHINGTON, June 2.--The four affidavits as presented to the State  Department by the German Embassy alleging that guns were carried by  the Lusitania are believed to constitute the evidence to which the  German Government referred in its last note. Should it develop that  the Foreign Office had been misinformed, German diplomatists said, an  acknowledgment of the mistake would not be withheld.    These affidavits were not made public by either the embassy or the  State Department, but the character of the individuals who made them  and their testimony is being made the subject of a quiet  investigation. Those officials who had seen the statements, however,  were confident that they could not be accepted as disproving the  testimony given by Inspectors whose duty it was to search for guns.      THE ARREST OF STAHL.    _The following report appeared in_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _June 11, 1915:_    Gustav Stahl, the former German soldier who made an affidavit that he  saw four guns mounted on the Lusitania on the night before it sailed  from this port on its last voyage and who disappeared immediately  after the affidavit was made public, was produced by Secret Service  men before the Federal Grand Jury yesterday afternoon at a proceeding  to determine whether Paul Koenig, alias Stemler, who is the head of  the detective bureau of the Hamburg-American Line, and others unnamed,  had entered into a conspiracy to defraud the United States Government.  The fraud is not stated specifically, and the charge is a technical  one that may cover a variety of acts.    Stahl, who speaks little English, affirmed through an interpreter to  the Grand Jury that he had seen the guns on the Lusitania. He was  questioned for two hours and a half and told his story with great  detail.    As he was leaving the Grand Jury room he was arrested by United States  Marshal Thomas B. McCarthy on a complaint made on information and  belief by Assistant District Attorney Raymond H. Sarfaty that Stahl  had committed perjury in his testimony before the Federal Grand Jury.  Stahl was held in bail of $10,000 by United States Commissioner  Houghton and locked up in the Tombs.    Stahl was the only witness heard by the Grand Jury in the proceedings  against Koenig. It was learned that Stahl had been in conference with  Koenig before he made the affidavit, and that his affidavit had passed  through Koenig's hands before it went to Ambassador Bernstorff, who  submitted it to Secretary of State Bryan.    The proceedings against Koenig were initiated to establish the charge  that Koenig used improper influence to induce Stahl to make the  affidavit.    While Stahl was waiting in the Marshal's chamber in the Federal  Building, after his arrest, for the arrival of Edward Sandford, a  lawyer, of 27 William Street, who had been assigned to act as his  counsel, he was asked, through an interpreter:    \"Would you be willing to spend twenty years in jail for your  Fatherland?\"    \"Make it a hundred!\" he replied, in German, and then broke into a  hearty laugh.    Stahl is about 27 years old and slightly under middle size. He has a  round, somewhat rosy countenance, dark hair getting very thin in  front, and parted in the middle, dark-brown eyes and a small,  closely-cropped dark"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#4)"],[1," in France,         early in the fifteenth century                                   306      144.

LIBRARIES IN      GREECE, ALEXANDRIA, PERGAMON, ROME. THEIR SIZE, USE,      CONTEXTS, AND FITTINGS. ARMARIA OR PRESSES. THE VATICAN      LIBRARY OF SIXTUS V. A TYPE OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN LIBRARY.    I propose, in the following Essay, to trace the methods adopted by man in  different ages and countries to preserve, to use, and to make accessible  to others, those objects, of whatever material, on which he has recorded  his thoughts. In this investigation I shall include the position, the  size, and the arrangement, of the rooms in which these treasures were  deposited, with the progressive development of fittings, catalogues, and  other appliances, whether defensive, or to facilitate use. But, though I  shall have to trace out these matters in some detail, I shall try to  eschew mere antiquarianism, and to impart human interest, so far as  possible, to a research which might otherwise exhaust the patience of my  readers. Bibliography, it must be understood, will be wholly excluded.  From my special point of view books are simply things to be taken care of:  even their external features concern me only so far as they modify the  methods adopted for arrangement and preservation. I must dismiss the  subject-matter of the volumes which filled the libraries of former days  with a brevity of which I deeply regret the necessity. I shall point out  the pains taken to sort the books under various comprehensive heads; but I  shall not enumerate the authors which fall under this or that division.    The earliest repositories of books were connected with temples or palaces,  either because priests under all civilisations have been _par excellence_  the learned class, while despots have patronised art and literature; or  because such a position was thought to offer greater security.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Plan of the Record-Rooms in the Palace of  Assur-bani-pal, King of Nineveh.]    I will begin with Assyria, where the record-rooms, or we might almost say  the library, in the palace of Assur-bani-pal, King of Nineveh, were  discovered by Mr Layard in 1850 at Kouyunjik, on the Tigris, opposite  Mosul. The plan (fig. 1), taken from Mr Layard's work[1], will shew,  better than a long description, the position of these rooms, and their  relation to the rest of the building--which is believed to date from about  700 B.C. The long passage (No. XLIX) is one of the entrances to the  palace. Passing thence along the narrower passage (No. XLII) the explorers  soon reached a doorway (E), which led them into a large hall (No. XXIX),  whence a second doorway (F) brought them into a chamber (No. XXXVIII). On  the north side of this room were two doorways (G. G), each \"formed by two  colossal bas-reliefs of Dagon, the fish-god.\" \"The first doorway,\" says Mr  Layard, \"guarded by the fish-gods, led into two small chambers opening  into each other, and once panelled with bas-reliefs, the greater part of  which had been destroyed. I shall call these chambers 'the chambers of  records,' for, like 'the house of the rolls' or records, which Darius  ordered to be searched for the decree of Cyrus concerning the building of  the Temple of Jerusalem[2], they appear to have contained the decrees of  the Assyrian kings, as well as the archives of the empire.\"    Mr Layard was led to this conclusion by finding, in these rooms, enormous  quantities of inscribed tablets and cylinders of baked clay. \"To a height  of a foot or more from the floor they were entirely filled with them; some  entire, but the greater part broken into many fragments, probably by the  falling in of the upper part of the building.... These documents appear to  be of various kinds. Many are historical records of wars, and distant  expeditions undertaken by the Assyrians; some seem to be royal decrees,  and are stamped with the name of a king, the son of Esarhaddon; others  again ... contain lists of the gods, and probably a register of offerings  made in their temples[3].\"    So far Mr Layard. Subsequent researches have shewn that these two small  rooms--they were 27 feet and 23 feet long respectively, with a uniform  breadth of 20 feet--contained the literature as well as the official  documents of Assyria. The tablets have been sorted under the following  heads: History; Law; Science; Magic; Dogma; Legends: and it has been shewn  (1) that there was a special functionary to take charge of them; (2) that  they were arranged in series, with special precautions for keeping the  tablets forming a particular series in their proper sequence; (3) that  there was a general catalogue, and probably a class-catalogue as well[4].    Excavations in other parts of Assyria have added valuable information to  Layard's first discovery. Dr Wallis Budge, of the British Museum, whom I  have to thank for much kind assistance, tells me that \"Kouyunjik is hardly  a good example of a Mesopotamian library, for it is certain that the  tablets were thrown about out of their proper places when the city was  captured by the Medes about B.C. 609. The tablets were kept on shelves....  When I was digging at Derr some years ago we found the what I call 'Record  Chamber,' and we saw the tablets lying _in situ_ on slate shelves. There  were, however, not many literary tablets there, for the chamber was meant  to hold the commercial documents relating to the local temple....\" Dr  Budge concludes his letter with this very important sentence: \"We have no  definite proof of what I am going to say now, but I believe that the  bilingual[5] lists, which Assur-bani-pal had drawn up for his library at  Nineveh, were intended 'for the use of students.'\"    To this suggestion I would add the following. Does not the position of  these two rooms, easily accessible from the entrance to the palace, shew  that their contents might be consulted by persons who were denied  admission to the more private apartments? And further, does not the  presence of the god Dagon at the entrance indicate that the library was  under the protection of the deity as well as of the sovereign?    As a pendant to these Assyrian discoveries I may mention the vague rumour  echoed by Athenaeus of extensive libraries collected in the sixth century  before our era by Polycrates[6], tyrant of Samos, and Peisistratus,  tyrant of Athens, the latter collection, according to Aulus Gellius[7],  having been accessible to all who cared to use it. It must be admitted  that these stories are of doubtful authenticity; and further, that we have  no details of the way in which books were cared for in Greece during the  golden age of her literature. This dearth of information is the more  tantalizing as it is obvious that private libraries must have existed in a  city so cultivated as Athens; and we do, in fact, find a few notices which  tell us that such was the case. Xenophon[8], for instance, speaks of the  number of volumes in the possession of Euthydemus, a follower of Socrates;  and Athenaeus records, in the passage to which I have already alluded, the  names of several book-collectors, among whom are Euripides and Aristotle.    An allusion to the poet's bibliographical tastes has been detected in the  scene of _The Frogs_ of Aristophanes, where AEschylus and Euripides are  weighing verses against each other in the presence of Dionysus. AEschylus  exclaims:      [Greek: kai meket' emoige kat' epos, all' es ton stathmon    autos ta paidi', he gyne, kephisophon,    embas kathestho syllabon ta biblia,    ego de dy' epe ton emon ero monon.]      Come, no more single lines--let him bring all,    His wife, his children, his Cephisophon,    His books and everything, himself to boot--    I'll counterpoise them with a couple of lines[9].    With regard to Aristotle Strabo has preserved a tradition that he \"was the  "]]]
