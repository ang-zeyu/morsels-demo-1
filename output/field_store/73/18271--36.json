But he pulled through, and when he took to athletics, it  was wonderful how he got stronger.\"    By his intimate companions, and indeed by nearly everybody who knew him,  he was called Teddy, and this nickname clung to him when he went forth  into the great world to become a governor and a president. How the  nickname came first into use is not known.    Since those schoolboy days Mr. Roosevelt has been asked this  question:--    \"What did you expect to be, or dream of being, when you were a boy?\"    \"I do not recollect that I dreamed at all or planned at all,\" was the  answer. \"I simply obeyed the injunction, 'Whatever thy hand findeth to  do, do that with all thy might,' and so I took up what came along as it  came.\"    In 1876, while the great Centennial Exhibition was being held at  Philadelphia in commemoration of one hundred years of national liberty,  Theodore Roosevelt took up his residence at Cambridge, Massachusetts,  and became a student at Harvard College. During the previous year his  health had been poor indeed, but now he had taken hold of himself in  earnest.    \"I determined to be strong and well, and did everything to make myself  so,\" he has said. \"By the time I entered Harvard I was able to take part  in whatever sports I liked.\"    As perhaps some of my readers know, Harvard College (now termed a  University) is the oldest and largest institution of learning in the  United States. It was founded in 1636, and among its graduates numbered  John Quincy Adams, sixth President of our country. The college proper is  located in Cambridge, but some of the attached schools are in Boston.    Theodore Roosevelt was rich enough to have lived in elegant style while  at Harvard, but he preferred unostentatious quarters, and took two rooms  in the home of Benj. H. Richardson, at what was then No. 16 and is now  No. 88 Winthrop Street. The residence is a neat and comfortable one,  standing on the southwest corner of Winthrop and Holyoke streets.    The young student had two rooms on the second floor,--one of good size,  used for a study, and a small bedroom. In the whole four years he was at  the college he occupied these rooms, and he spent a great deal of time  in fixing them up to suit his own peculiar taste. On the walls were all  sorts of pictures and photographs, along with foils and boxing-gloves,  and the horns of wild animals. On a shelf rested some birds which he had  himself stuffed, and books were everywhere.    [Illustration: HOUSE IN WHICH THEODORE ROOSEVELT ROOMED WHILE AT  HARVARD.]    \"It was a regular den, and typical of Roosevelt to the last degree,\" a  student of those times has said. \"He had his gun there and his  fishing rod, and often spoke of using them. He was noted for trying to  get at the bottom of things, and I remember him well on one occasion  when I found him with a stuffed bird in one hand and a natural history  in the other, trying to decide if the description in the volume covered  the specimen before him.\" When Roosevelt graduated from college, he was  one of a very few that took honors, and the subject of his essay was  natural history. How his love of natural history continued will be shown  later when we see him as a ranchman and hunter of the West.    Theodore Roosevelt had decided to make the most of himself, and while at  Harvard scarcely a moment was wasted. If he was not studying, he was in  the gymnasium or on the field, doing what he could to make himself  strong. He was a firm believer in the saying that a sound body makes a  sound mind, and he speedily became a good boxer, wrestler, jumper, and  runner. He wrestled a great deal, and of this sport says:--    \"I enjoyed it immensely and never injured myself. I think I was a good  deal of a wrestler, and though I never won a championship, yet more  than once I won my trial heats and got into the final rounds.\"    At running he was equally good. \"I remember once we had a stiff run out  into the country,\" said a fellow-student. \"Roosevelt was behind at the  start, but when all of the others got played out he forged ahead, and in  the end he beat us by several minutes. But he never bragged about it.  You see, it wasn't his style.\"    With all his other sports, and his studying, the young collegian did not  give up his love for driving. He had a good horse and a fancy cart,--one  of the elevated sort with large wheels,--and in this turnout he was seen  many a day, driving wherever it pleased him to go. Sometimes he would  get on the road with other students, and then there was bound to be more  or less racing.    With a strong love for natural history it was not surprising that he  joined the Natural History Club of the college, and of this he was one  of the most active members. He also joined the Athletic Association, of  which he was a steward, and the Art Club, the Rifle Corps, the O.K.  Society, and the Finance Club. In his senior year he became a member of  the Porcellian Club, the Hasty Pudding, and the Alpha Delta Phi Club,  and also one of the editors of a college paper called the _Advocate_. On  Sundays he taught a class of boys, first in a mission school, and then  in a Congregational Sunday school. It was a life full of planning, full  of study, and full of work, and it suited Theodore Roosevelt to the last  degree.    As he grew older his love of natural history was supplemented by a love  for the history of nations, and particularly by a love of the history of  his own country. The war of 1812 interested him intensely, and before he  graduated he laid plans for writing a history of this war, which should  go into all the details of the memorable naval conflicts.    It was while in his third year at Harvard that Theodore Roosevelt  suffered the first heavy affliction of his life. On February 9, 1878,  his father died. It was a cruel blow to the family, and one from which  the faithful wife scarcely recovered. The son at Harvard felt his loss  greatly, and it was some time before he felt able to resume his studies.  The elder Roosevelt's work as a philanthropist was well known, and many  gathered at his bier to do him honor, while the public journals were  filled with eulogies of the man. The poor mourned bitterly that he was  gone, and even the newsboys were filled with regret over his taking  away. In speaking of his parent, President Roosevelt once said: \"I can  remember seeing him going down Broadway, staid and respectable business  man that he was, with a poor sick kitten in his coat pocket, which he  had picked up in the street.\" Such a man could not but have a heart  overflowing with goodness.    While at college Theodore Roosevelt often showed that self-reliance for  which he has since become famous. To every study that he took up he  applied himself closely, and if he was not at the head of the class, he  was by no means near the foot. When he was sure of a thing, no amount of  argument could convince him that he was wrong, and he did not hesitate  at times to enter into a discussion even with some of the professors  over him.    Although a close student, and also a good all-round athlete, Theodore  Roosevelt did not forget his social opportunities. Boston was but a  short distance from his rooms in Cambridge, and thither he often went to  visit the people he had met or to whom he had letters of introduction.  He was always welcome, for his manner was a winning one, and he usually  had something to tell that was of interest--something of what he had  seen or done, of the next foot-ball or base-ball game, of the coming  boat races, of his driving or exploring, or of how he had added a new  stuffed bird to his collection, or a new lizard, and of how a far-away  friend had sent him a big turtle as a souvenir of an ocean trip in the  South Seas. There is a story that this big turtle got loose one night  and alarmed the entire household by crawling through the hallway,  looking for a pond or mud-hole in which to wallow. At first the turtle  was mistaken for a burglar, but he soon revealed himself by his angry  snapping, and it was hard work making him a prisoner once more.          CHAPTER III    MARRIES MISS ALICE LEE--TRAVELS IN EUROPE--BOLD  MOUNTAIN-CLIMBING--STUDYING LAW IN NEW YORK--ELECTED TO THE  ASSEMBLY--PERSONAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE ENEMY      It was a proud and happy day for Theodore Roosevelt when, in the summer  of 1880, he was graduated from Harvard. He took scholarly as well as  social honors, and came forth a Phi Beta Kappa man. His fellow-students  wished him well, and his family greeted him most affectionately.    Yet with it all there was just a bit of melancholy in this breaking away  from a place that had been as a second home to him for four long years.  The students were scattering to the four points of the compass, and he  might never see some of them again. But others were there whom he was to  meet later, and who were destined to march under him up the bullet-swept  slopes of San Juan in far-away Cuba. But at that time there was no  thought of war and carnage, only good-fellowship, with addresses and  orations, music, flying flags, and huge bonfires and fireworks at night.  Happy college days were they, never to be forgotten.    [Illustration: THEODORE ROOSEVELT AT GRADUATION, 1880.]    While a student at Harvard, Theodore Roosevelt had become intimately  acquainted with Miss Alice Lee, of Boston, a beautiful girl who was a  member of an aristocratic family of that city. The young college student  was a frequent visitor at the home of the Lees, and on September 23,  1880, the two were married.    It had been decided that Theodore Roosevelt should travel in Europe  after graduating. His father had left the family well provided for, so  there was no rush to get into something whereby a living might be  earned. Yet Theodore Roosevelt had long since determined not to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22373"],[0,"Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore (#4)"],[1,"to which the stories contain so  many references. Sometimes we see the better class of homestead,  surrounded by its fence through which we pass between the  often-mentioned gates. After a glance at the barns and cattle-sheds,  and at the garden which supplies the family with fruits and vegetables  (on flowers, alas! but little store is set in the northern provinces),  we cross the threshold, a spot hallowed by many traditions, and pass,  through what in more pretentious houses may be called the vestibule,  into the \"living room.\" We become well acquainted with its  arrangements, with the cellar beneath its wooden floor, with the  \"corner of honor\" in which are placed the \"holy pictures,\" and with  the stove which occupies so large a share of space, within which daily  beats, as it were the heart of the house, above which is nightly taken  the repose of the family. Sometimes we visit the hut of the  poverty-stricken peasant, more like a shed for cattle than a human  habitation, with a mud-floor and a tattered roof, through which the  smoke makes its devious way. In these poorer dwellings we witness much  suffering; but we learn to respect the patience and resignation with  which it is generally borne, and in the greater part of the humble  homes we visit we become aware of the existence of many domestic  virtues, we see numerous tokens of family affection, of filial  reverence, of parental love. And when, as we pass along the village  street at night, we see gleaming through the utter darkness the faint  rays which tell that even in many a poverty-stricken home a lamp is  burning before the \"holy pictures,\" we feel that these poor tillers of  the soil, ignorant and uncouth though they too often are, may be  raised at times by lofty thoughts and noble aspirations far above the  low level of the dull and hard lives which they are forced to lead.    From among the stories which contain the most graphic descriptions of  Russian village life, or which may be regarded as specially  illustrative of Russian sentiment and humor those which the present  chapter contains have been selected. Any information they may convey  will necessarily be of a most fragmentary nature, but for all that it  may be capable of producing a correct impression. A painter's rough  notes and jottings are often more true to nature than the most  finished picture into which they may be developed.    The word skazka, or folk-tale, does not very often occur in the  Russian popular tales themselves. Still there are occasions on which  it appears. The allusions to it are for the most part indirect, as  when a princess is said to be more beautiful than anybody ever was,  except in a skazka; but sometimes it obtains direct notice. In a  story, for instance, of a boy who had been carried off by a Baba Yaga  (a species of witch), we are told that when his sister came to his  rescue she found him \"sitting in an arm-chair, while the cat Jeremiah  told him skazkas and sang him songs.\"[15] In another story, a  _Durak_,--a \"ninny\" or \"gowk\"--is sent to take care of the children of  a village during the absence of their parents. \"Go and get all the  children together in one of the cottages and tell them skazkas,\" are  his instructions. He collects the children, but as they are \"all ever  so dirty\" he puts them into boiling water by way of cleansing them,  and so washes them to death.[16]    There is a good deal of social life in the Russian villages during the  long winter evenings, and at some of the gatherings which then take  place skazkas are told, though at those in which only the young people  participate, songs, games, and dances are more popular. The following  skazka has been selected on account of the descriptions of a  _vechernitsa_, or village _soiree_,[17] and of a rustic courtship,  which its opening scene contains. The rest of the story is not  remarkable for its fidelity to modern life, but it will serve as a  good illustration of the class to which it belongs--that of stories  about evil spirits, traceable, for the most part, to Eastern sources.        THE FIEND.[18]      In a certain country there lived an old couple who had a daughter    called Marusia (Mary). In their village it was customary to    celebrate the feast of St. Andrew the First-Called (November    30). The girls used to assemble in some cottage, bake _pampushki_,[19]    and enjoy themselves for a whole week, or even longer.    Well, the girls met together once when this festival arrived, and    brewed and baked what was wanted. In the evening came the    lads with the music, bringing liquor with them, and dancing and    revelry commenced. All the girls danced well, but Marusia the    best of all. After a while there came into the cottage such a    fine fellow! Marry, come up! regular blood and milk, and    smartly and richly dressed.      \"Hail, fair maidens!\" says he.      \"Hail, good youth!\" say they.      \"You're merry-making?\"      \"Be so good as to join us.\"      Thereupon he pulled out of his pocket a purse full of gold,    ordered liquor, nuts and gingerbread. All was ready in a trice,    and he began treating the lads and lasses, giving each a share.    Then he took to dancing. Why, it was a treat to look at him!    Marusia struck his fancy more than anyone else; so he stuck    close to her. The time came for going home.      \"Marusia,\" says he, \"come and see me off.\"      She went to see him off.      \"Marusia, sweetheart!\" says he, \"would you like me to    marry you?\"      \"If you like to marry me, I will gladly marry you. But    where do you come from?\"      \"From such and such a place. I'm clerk at a merchant's.\"      Then they bade each other farewell and separated. When    Marusia got home, her mother asked her:      \"Well, daughter! have you enjoyed yourself?\"      \"Yes, mother. But I've something pleasant to tell you besides.    There was a lad there from the neighborhood, good-looking    and with lots of money, and he promised to marry me.\"      \"Harkye Marusia! When you go to where the girls are to-morrow,    take a ball of thread with you, make a noose in it, and,    when you are going to see him off, throw it over one of his buttons,    and quietly unroll the ball; then, by means of the thread,    you will be able to find out where he lives.\"      Next day Marusia went to the gathering, and took a ball of    thread with her. The youth came again.      \"Good evening, Marusia!\" said he.      \"Good evening!\" said she.      Games began and dances. Even more than before did he    stick to Marusia, not a step would he budge from her. The time    came for going home.      \"Come and see me off, Marusia!\" says the stranger.      She went out into the street, and while she was taking leave    of him she quietly dropped the noose over one of his buttons.    He went his way, but she remained where she was, unrolling the    ball. When she had unrolled the whole of it, she ran after the    thread to find out where her betrothed lived. At first the thread    followed the road, then it stretched across hedges and ditches,    and led Marusia towards the church and right up to the porch.    Marusia tried the door; it was locked. She went round the    church, found a ladder, set it against a window, and climbed up    it to see what was going on inside. Having got into the church,    she looked--and saw her betrothed standing beside a grave and    devouring a dead body--for a corpse had been left for that    night in the church.      She wanted to get down the ladder quietly, but her fright prevented    her from taking proper heed, and she made a little noise.    Then she ran home--almost beside herself, fancying all the    time she was being pursued. She was all but dead before she    got in. Next morning her mother asked her:      \"Well, Marusia! did you see the youth?\"      \"I saw him, mother,\" she replied. But what else she had    seen she did not tell.      In the morning Marusia was sitting, considering whether she    would go to the gathering or not.      \"Go,\" said her mother. \"Amuse yourself while you're    young!\"      So she went to the gathering; the Fiend[20] was there already.    Games, fun, dancing, began anew; the girls knew nothing of    what had happened. When they began to separate and go    homewards:      \"Come, Marusia!\" says the Evil One, \"see me off.\"      She was afraid, and didn't stir. Then all the other girls    opened out upon her.      \"What are you thinking about? Have you grown so bashful,    forsooth? Go and see the good lad off.\"      There was no help for it. Out she went, not knowing what    would come of it. As soon as they got into the streets he began    questioning her:      \"You were in the church last night?\"      \"No.\"      \"And saw what I was doing there?\"      \"No.\"      \"Very well! To-morrow your father will die!\"      Having said this, he disappeared.      Marusia returned home grave and sad. When she woke up    in the morning, her father lay dead!      They wept and wailed over him, and laid him in the coffin.    In the evening her mother went off to the priest's, but Marusia    remained at home. At last she became afraid of being alone in    the house. \"Suppose I go to my friends,\" she thought. So    she went, and found the Evil One there.      \"Good evening, Marusia! why arn't you merry?\"      \"How can I be merry? My father is dead!\"      \"Oh! poor thing!\"      They all grieved for her. Even the Accursed One himself    grieved; just as if it hadn't all been his own doing. By and by    they began saying farewell and going home.      \"Marusia,\" says he, \"see me off.\"      She didn't want to.      \"What are you thinking of, child?\" insist the girls. \"What    are you afraid of? Go and see him off.\"      So she went to see him off. They passed out into the street.      \"Tell me, Marusia,\" says he, \"were you in the church?\"      \"No.\"      \"Did you see what I was doing?\"      \"No.\"      \"Very well! To-morrow your mother"]]]
