Each sheet of paper when folded constitutes a  section, except in the case of folios, where it is usual to make up  the sections by inserting two or more sheets, one within the other.    Paper is made in several named sizes, such as \"imperial,\" \"royal,\"  \"demy,\" \"crown,\" \"foolscap,\" &c. (see p. 283), so that the terms  \"imperial folio\" or \"crown octavo\" imply that a sheet of a definite  size has been folded a definite number of times.        [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Besides the traditional sizes, paper is now made of almost any length  and width, resulting in books of odd shape, and the names folio,  quarto, &c., are rather losing their true meaning, and are often used  loosely to signify pages of certain sizes, irrespective of the number  that go to a sheet.    On receipt, for instance, of an octavo book for folding, the pile of  sheets is laid flat on the table, and collated by the letter or  signature of each sheet. The first sheet of the book proper will  probably be signature B, as signature A usually consists of the  half-title, title, introduction, &c., and often has to be folded up  rather differently.    The \"outer\" sides, known by the signature letters B, C, D, &c., should  be downwards, and the inner sides facing upwards with the second  signatures, if there are any, B2, C2, D2, &c., at the right-hand  bottom corner.    The pages of an octave book, commencing at page 1, are shown at fig.  3. A folder is taken in the right hand, and held at the bottom of the  sheet at about the centre, and the sheet taken by the left hand at the  top right-hand corner and bent over until pages 3 and 6 come exactly  over pages 2 and 7; and when it is seen that the headlines and figures  exactly match, the paper, while being held in that position, is  creased down the centre with the folder, and the fold cut up a little  more than half-way. Pages 4, 13, 5, 12 will now be uppermost; pages 12  and 5 are now folded over to exactly match pages 13 and 4, and the  fold creased and cut up a little more than half-way, as before. Pages  8 and 9 will now be uppermost, and will merely require folding  together to make the pages of the section follow in their proper  order. If the folding has been done carefully, and the \"register\" of  the printing is good, the headlines should be exactly even throughout.        [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    The object of cutting past the centre at each fold is to avoid the  unsightly creasing that results from folding two or more thicknesses  of paper when joined at the top edge.    A \"duodecimo\" sheet has the pages arranged as at fig. 4.    The \"inset\" pages, 10, 15, 14, 11, must be cut off, and the rest of  the section folded as for an octavo sheet. The inset is folded  separately and inserted into the centre of the octavo portion.    Other sizes are folded in much the same way, and the principle of  folding one sheet having been mastered, no difficulty will be found in  folding any other.    Plates often require trimming, and this must be done with judgment.  The plates should be trimmed to correspond as far as possible with the  printing on the opposite page, but if this cannot be done, it is  desirable that something approaching the proportion of margin shown at  fig. 2 (folio) should be aimed at. That is to say, the back margin  should be the smallest, the head margin the next, the fore-edge a  little wider, and the tail widest of all. When a plate consists of a  small portrait or diagram in the centre of the page, it looks better  if it is put a little higher and a little nearer the back than the  actual centre.        [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    Plates that have no numbers on them must be put in order by the list  of printed plates, or \"instructions to the binder.\" The half-title,  title, dedication, &c., will often be found to be printed on odd  sheets that have to be made up into section A. This preliminary matter  is usually placed in the following order: Half-title, title,  dedication, preface, contents, list of illustrations or other lists.  If there is an index, it should be put at the end of the book.    All plates should be \"guarded,\" and any \"quarter sections,\" that is,  sections consisting of two leaves, should have their backs  strengthened by a \"guard,\" or they may very easily be torn in the  sewing. Odd, single leaves may be guarded round sections in the same  way as plates.    When a book has been folded, it should be pressed (see p. 87).    There will sometimes be pages marked by the printer with a star. These  have some error in them, and are intended to be cut out. The printer  should supply corrected pages to replace them.                                     COLLATING    In addition to the pagination each sheet or section of a printed book  is lettered or numbered. Each letter or number is called the \"sheet's  signature.\" Printers usually leave out J W and V in lettering sheets.  If there are more sections than there are letters in the alphabet, the  printer doubles the letters, signing the sections A A, B B, and so on,  after the single letters are exhausted. Some printers use an Arabic  numeral before the section number to denote the second alphabet, as  2A, 2B, &c., and others change the character of the letters, perhaps  using capitals for the first alphabet and italics for the second. If  the sheets are numbered, the numbers will of course follow  consecutively. In books of more than one volume, the number of the  volume is sometimes added in Roman numerals before the signature, as  II A, II B.    The main pagination of the book usually commences with Chapter I., and  all before that is independently paged in Roman numerals. It is  unusual to have actual numbers on the title or half-title, but if the  pages are counted back from where the first numeral occurs, they  should come right.    There will sometimes be one or more blank leaves completing sections  at the beginning or end. Such blank leaves must be retained, as  without them the volume would be \"imperfect.\"    To collate a modern book the paging must be examined to see that the  leaves are in order, and that nothing is defective or missing.    The method of doing this is to insert the first finger of the right  hand at the bottom of about the fiftieth page, crook the finger, and  turn up the corners of the pages with it. When this is done the thumb  is placed on page 1, and the hand twisted, so as to fan out the top of  the pages. They can then be readily turned over by the thumb and first  finger of the left hand (see fig. 5). This is repeated throughout the  book, taking about fifty pages at a time. It will of course only be  necessary to check the odd numbers, as if they are right, the even  ones on the other side of the leaf must be so. If the pages are  numbered at the foot, the leaves must be fanned out from the head.        [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    Plates or maps that are not paged can only be checked from the printed  list. When checked it will save time if the number of the page which  each faces is marked on the back in small pencil figures.    In the case of early printed books or manuscripts, which are often not  paged, special knowledge is needed for their collation. It may roughly  be said, that if the sections are all complete, that is, if there are  the same number of leaves at each side of the sewing in all the  sections, the book may be taken to be perfect, unless of course whole  sections are missing. All unpaged books should be paged through in  pencil before they are taken apart; this is best done with a very fine  pencil, at the bottom left-hand corner; it will only be necessary to  number the front of each leaf.                                 PULLING TO PIECES    After the volume has been collated it must be \"pulled,\" that is to  say, the sections must be separated, and all plates or maps detached.    If in a bound book there are slips laced in the front cover, they must  be cut and the back torn off. It will sometimes happen that in tearing  off the leather nearly all the glue will come too, leaving the backs  of the pages detached except for the sewing. More usually the back  will be left covered with a mass of glue and linen, or paper, which it  is very difficult to remove without injury to the backs of the  sections. By drawing a sharp knife along the bands, the sewing may be  cut and the bands removed, leaving the sections only connected by the  glue. Then the sections of the book can usually be separated with a  fine folder, after the thread from the centre of each has been  removed; the point of division being ascertained by finding the first  signature of each section. In cases where the glue and leather form  too hard a back to yield to this method, it is advisable to soak the  glue with paste, and when soft to scrape it off with a folder. As this  method is apt to injure the backs of the sections, it should not be  resorted to unless necessary; and when it is, care must be taken not  to let the damp penetrate into the book, or it will cause very ugly  stains. The book must be pulled while damp, or else the glue will dry  up harder than before. The separated sections must be piled up  carefully to prevent pages being soiled by the damp glue.    All plates or single leaves \"pasted on\" must be removed. These can  usually be detached by carefully tearing apart, but if too securely  pasted they must be soaked off in water, unless of course the plates  have been painted with water-colour. If the plates must be soaked off,  the leaf and attached plate should be put into a pan of slightly warm  water and left to soak until they float apart, then with a soft brush  any remaining glue or paste can be easily removed while in the water.  Care must be taken not to soak modern books printed on what is called  \"Art Paper,\" as this paper will hardly stand ordinary handling, and is  absolutely ruined if wetted.

[Music]    You Master Colours pray draw near,    And listen to my Report;  My Grief is great, for lo of late,    Two Ladies I chanc'd to Court:  Who did meet me on _Tower-Hill_,    Their Beauties I did behold:  _Those Crafty Jades have learnt their Trades,_    _And plunder'd me of my Gold._    I'll tell you how it came to pass,    This sorrowful Story is thus:  Of Guineas bright a glorious Sight,    I had in a Cat-skin Purse:  The Value of near Fourscore Pounds,    As good as e'er I had told,  _Those Crafty Jades have learnt their Trades,_    _And plunder'd me of my Gold._    I saw two poor distressed Men,    Who lay upon _Tower-Hill_,  To whom in brief I gave Relief,    According to my good Will:  Two wanton Misses drawing near,    My Guineas they did behold;  They laid a Plot by which they Got,    My Silver and yellow Gold.    They both address'd themselves to me,    And thus they was pleas'd to say;  Kind Sir, indeed, we stand in need,    Altho' we are fine and gay:  Of some Relief which you may give,    I thought they were something bold;  The Plot was laid, I was betray'd,    And plunder'd of all my Gold.    Alas 'tis pity, then I cry'd,    Such Ladies of good Repute,  Should want Relief, therefore in brief,    I gave 'em a kind Salute:  Thought I of them I'll have my Will,    Altho' I am something old;  They were I see too wise for me,    They plunder'd me of my Gold.    Then to _East-Smithfield_ was I led,    And there I was entertain'd:  With Kisses fine and Brandy Wine,    In Merriment we remain'd:  Methought it was the happiest Day,    That ever I did behold;  Sweet Meat alass! had sower Sauce,    They plunder'd me of my Gold.    Time after Time to pay their Shot,    My Guineas I would lug out;  Those Misses they wou'd make me stay,    And rally the other bout:  I took my Fill of Pleasures then    Altho' I was something old;  Those Joys are past, they would not last,    I'm plunder'd of all my Gold.    As I was at the wanton Game,    My Pocket they fairly pick'd;  And all my Wealth they took by stealth,    Thus was a poor Colour trick'd:  Let me therefore a Warning be,    To Merchants both young and old;  For now of late hard was my Fate,    I'm plunder'd of all my Gold.    They got three Pounds in Silver bright,    And Guineas above Threescore,  Such sharping Cracks breaks Merchants Backs,    I'll never come near them more:  Sure now I have enough of them,    My Sorrow cannot be told;  That crafty Crew makes me look Blew,    I'm plunder'd of all my Gold.          _The Dance of the_ USURER _and the_ Devil.      [Music]    Last _Christmas_ 'twas my chance,    To be in _Paris_ City;  Where I did see a Dance,    In my conceit was very pretty--By men of France.    First came the Lord of _Pool_,    And he begun his Measure;  The next came in a Fool,    And danc'd with him for pleasure--With his Tool.    The next a Knight came in,    Who look'd as he would swagger;  And after follow'd him    A merry needy Beggar--Dancing in.    The next a Gentleman,    On him a Servant tending,  And there the Dance began,    With nimble Bodies bending--Like two Friends.    Then in a Lawyer came,    With him a Knave came leaping;  And as they Danc'd in Frame,    So Hand in Hand went skipping--To the Term.    The next a Citizen,    And he a Cuckold leading;  So round about the Room,    Their Masque they fell a Treading--And fain they would.    The next an Usurer,    Old fat Guts he came grunting;  The Devil left all care,    For joy he fell a Jumping--To see him there.    And ending then their Masque,    The Fool his Lord he carries  Upon his Back in hast,    No longer there he tarries--But left the place.    The Beggar took the Knight,    Who took it in Derision;  The Searjeant took in Spite,    The Gentleman to Prison--For all his might.    The Cuckold, silly Man,    Altho' he was abhorred:  He took the Citizen,    And led him by the Forehead--And out he ran.    The Devil lik'd it well,    His lot it was to carry;  The Usurer to Hell,    And there with him to tarry.          _The_ SUBURBS _is a fine place: To the_ Tune _of_ LONDON _is a fine  Town._      [Music]    The Suburbs is a fine Place belonging to the City,  It has no Government at all, alack the more the Pity;  A Wife, a silly Animal, esteemed in that same Place,  For there a Civil Woman's now asham'd to shew her Face:  The Misses there have each Man's Time, his Money, nay, his Heart,  Then all in all, both great and small, and all in ev'ry Part.    Which Part it is a thorough-fair so open and so large,  One well might sail through ev'ry Tail even in a western Barge;  These Cracks that Coach it now, when first they came to Town,  Did turn up Tail for a Pot of Ale in Linsey Wolsey Gown.    The Bullies first debauch'd 'em, in Baudy _Covent-Garden_,  That filthy place, where ne'er a Wench was ever worth a Farthing;  And when their Maiden-heads are sold to sneaking Lords,  Which Lords are Clapt at least nine-fold for taking of their Words.    And then my Lord, that many tries, she looks so Innocent,  Believing he Infected her, he makes a Settlement;  These are your Cracks, who skill'd in all kind of Debauches,  Do daily piss, spue and whore in their own glass Coaches.    Now Miss turn Night-walker, till Lord-Mayor's Men she meets,  O'er Night she's Drunk, next Day she's finely flogged thro' _London_    streets;  After their Rooms of State are chang'd to Bulks or Coblers Stalls,  'Till Poverty and Pox agree they dying in Hospitals.    This Suburbs gallant Fop that takes delight in Roaring,  He spends his time in Huffing, Swearing, Drinking, and in Whoring;  And if an honest Man and his Wife meet them in the Dark,  Makes nothing to run the Husband through to get the name of Spark.    But when the Constable appears, the Gallant, let me tell ye,  His Heart denies his Breeches, and sinks into his Belly;  These are the silly Rogues that think it fine and witty,  To laugh and joak at Aldermen, the Rulers of the City.    They'd kiss our Wives, but hold, for all their plotting Pates,  While they would get us Children, we are getting their Estates;  And still in vain they Court pretending in their Cares,  That their Estates may thus descend unto the Lawful Heirs.    Their Play-houses I hate, are Shops to set off Wenches,  Where Fop and Miss, like Dog and Bitch, do couple under Benches;  That I might advise the chiefest Play-house monger,  I have a Sister of my own both Handsomer and Younger.    She lives not far off in the Parish of St. _Clements_,  She never liv'd in Cellar nor sold Oranges and Lemons:  Then why should Play-house Trulls with Paint and such Temptations,  Be an Eye sore to me & more to the best part o'th' Nation.    Now you that all this while have listened to my Dity,  With streightened Hands pray drink a Health unto this noble City:  And let us pray to _Jove_, these Suburb folks to mend,  And having now no more to say, I think it fit to end.          _The Old Woman's_ WISH.      [Music]    As I went by an Hospital,    I heard an Old Woman cry,  Kind Sir, quoth she, be kind to me,    Once more before I Die,  And grant to me those Joys,    That belong to Woman-kind,  And the"]]]
