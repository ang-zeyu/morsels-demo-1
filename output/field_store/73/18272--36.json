Saturn is usually represented bearing a sickle in the one hand and a  wheat-sheaf in the other.    A temple was erected to him at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, in which  were deposited the public treasury and the laws of the state.    RHEA (OPS).    Rhea, the wife of Cronus, and mother of Zeus and the other great gods of  Olympus, personified the earth, and was regarded as the Great Mother and  unceasing producer of all plant-life. She was also believed to exercise  unbounded sway over the animal creation, more especially over the lion, the  noble king of beasts. Rhea is generally represented wearing a crown of  turrets or towers and seated on a throne, with lions crouching at her feet.  She is sometimes depicted sitting in a chariot, drawn by lions.    The principal seat of her worship, which was always of a very riotous  character, was at Crete. At her festivals, which took place at night, the  wildest music of flutes, cymbals, and drums resounded, whilst joyful shouts  and cries, accompanied by dancing and loud stamping of feet, filled the  air.    This divinity was introduced into Crete by its first colonists from  Phrygia, in Asia Minor, in which country she was worshipped under the name  of Cybele. The people of Crete adored her as the Great Mother, more  especially in her signification as the sustainer of the vegetable world.  Seeing, however, that year by year, as winter appears, all her glory  vanishes, her flowers fade, and her trees become leafless, they poetically  expressed this process of nature under the figure of a lost love. She {19}  was said to have been tenderly attached to a youth of remarkable beauty,  named Atys, who, to her grief and indignation, proved faithless to her. He  was about to unite himself to a nymph called Sagaris, when, in the midst of  the wedding feast, the rage of the incensed goddess suddenly burst forth  upon all present. A panic seized the assembled guests, and Atys, becoming  afflicted with temporary madness, fled to the mountains and destroyed  himself. Cybele, moved with sorrow and regret, instituted a yearly mourning  for his loss, when her priests, the Corybantes, with their usual noisy  accompaniments, marched into the mountains to seek the lost youth. Having  discovered him[6] they gave full vent to their ecstatic delight by  indulging in the most violent gesticulations, dancing, shouting, and, at  the same time, wounding and gashing themselves in a frightful manner.    OPS.    In Rome the Greek Rhea was identified with Ops, the goddess of plenty, the  wife of Saturn, who had a variety of appellations. She was called  Magna-Mater, Mater-Deorum, Berecynthia-Idea, and also Dindymene. This  latter title she acquired from three high mountains in Phrygia, whence she  was brought to Rome as Cybele during the second Punic war, B.C. 205, in  obedience to an injunction contained in the Sybilline books. She was  represented as a matron crowned with towers, seated in a chariot drawn by  lions.           *       *       *       *       *    DIVISION OF THE WORLD.    We will now return to Zeus and his brothers, who, having gained a complete  victory over their enemies, began to consider how the world, which they had  {20} conquered, should be divided between them. At last it was settled by  lot that Zeus should reign supreme in Heaven, whilst Aides governed the  Lower World, and Poseidon had full command over the Sea, but the supremacy  of Zeus was recognized in all three kingdoms, in heaven, on earth (in which  of course the sea was included), and under the earth. Zeus held his court  on the top of Mount Olympus, whose summit was beyond the clouds; the  dominions of Aides were the gloomy unknown regions below the earth; and  Poseidon reigned over the sea. It will be seen that the realm of each of  these gods was enveloped in mystery. Olympus was shrouded in mists, Hades  was wrapt in gloomy darkness, and the sea was, and indeed still is, a  source of wonder and deep interest. Hence we see that what to other nations  were merely strange phenomena, served this poetical and imaginative people  as a foundation upon which to build the wonderful stories of their  mythology.    The division of the world being now satisfactorily arranged, it would seem  that all things ought to have gone on smoothly, but such was not the case.  Trouble arose in an unlooked-for quarter. The Giants, those hideous  monsters (some with legs formed of serpents) who had sprung from the earth  and the blood of Uranus, declared war against the triumphant deities of  Olympus, and a struggle ensued, which, in consequence of Gaea having made  these children of hers invincible as long as they kept their feet on the  ground, was wearisome and protracted. Their mother's precaution, however,  was rendered unavailing by pieces of rock being hurled upon them, which  threw them down, and their feet being no longer placed firmly on their  mother-earth, they were overcome, and this tedious war (which was called  the Gigantomachia) at last came to an end. Among the most daring of these  earth-born giants were Enceladus, Rhoetus, and the valiant Mimas, who, with  youthful fire and energy, hurled against heaven great masses of rock and  burning oak-trees, and defied the lightnings of Zeus. One of the most  powerful monsters who opposed Zeus in this {21} war was called Typhon or  Typhoeus. He was the youngest son of Tartarus and Gaea, and had a hundred  heads, with eyes which struck terror to the beholders, and awe-inspiring  voices frightful to hear. This dreadful monster resolved to conquer both  gods and men, but his plans were at length defeated by Zeus, who, after a  violent encounter, succeeded in destroying him with a thunderbolt, but not  before he had so terrified the gods that they had fled for refuge to Egypt,  where they metamorphosed themselves into different animals and thus  escaped.           *       *       *       *       *    THEORIES AS TO THE ORIGIN OF MAN.    Just as there were several theories concerning the origin of the world, so  there were various accounts of the creation of man.    The first natural belief of the Greek people was that man had sprung from  the earth. They saw the tender plants and flowers force their way through  the ground in the early spring of the year after the frost of winter had  disappeared, and so they naturally concluded that man must also have issued  from the earth in a similar manner. Like the wild plants and flowers, he  was supposed to have had no cultivation, and resembled in his habits the  untamed beasts of the field, having no habitation except that which nature  had provided in the holes of the rocks, and in the dense forests whose  overarching boughs protected him from the inclemency of the weather.    In the course of time these primitive human beings became tamed and  civilized by the gods and heroes, who taught them to work in metals, to  build houses, and other useful arts of civilization. But the human race  became in the course of time so degenerate that the gods resolved to  destroy all mankind by means of a flood; Deucalion {22} (son of Prometheus)  and his wife Pyrrha, being, on account of their piety, the only mortals  saved.    By the command of his father, Deucalion built a ship, in which he and his  wife took refuge during the deluge, which lasted for nine days. When the  waters abated the ship rested on Mount Othrys in Thessaly, or according to  some on Mount Parnassus. Deucalion and his wife now consulted the oracle of  Themis as to how the human race might be restored. The answer was, that  they were to cover their heads, and throw the bones of their mother behind  them. For some time they were perplexed as to the meaning of the oracular  command, but at length both agreed that by the bones of their mother were  meant the stones of the earth. They accordingly took up stones from the  mountain side and cast them over their shoulders. From those thrown by  Deucalion there sprang up men, and from those thrown by Pyrrha, women.    After the lapse of time the theory of Autochthony (from _autos_, self, and  _chthon_, earth) was laid aside. When this belief existed there were no  religious teachers whatever; but in course of time temples were raised in  honour of the different gods, and priests appointed to offer sacrifices to  them and conduct their worship. These priests were looked upon as  authorities in all religious matters, and the doctrine they taught was,  that man had been created by the gods, and that there had been several  successive ages of men, which were called the Golden, Silver, Brazen, and  Iron Ages.    Life in the Golden Age was one unceasing round of ever-recurring pleasures  unmarred by sorrow or care. The favoured mortals living at this happy time  led pure and joyous lives, thinking no evil, and doing no wrong. The earth  brought forth fruits and flowers without toil or labour in plentiful  luxuriance, and war was unknown. This delightful and god-like existence  lasted for hundreds of years, and when at length life on earth was ended,  death laid his hand so gently upon them that they passed painlessly away in  a happy dream, and continued their existence as ministering spirits in  Hades, watching over and {23} protecting those they had loved and left  behind on earth. The men of the Silver Age[7] were a long time growing up,  and during their childhood, which lasted a hundred years, they suffered  from ill-health and extreme debility. When they at last became men they  lived but a short time, for they would not abstain from mutual injury, nor  pay the service due to the gods, and were therefore banished to Hades.  There, unlike the beings of the Golden Age, they exercised no beneficent  supervision over the dear ones left behind, but wandered about as restless  spirits, always sighing for the lost pleasures they had enjoyed in life.    The men of the Brazen Age were quite a different"]]]
