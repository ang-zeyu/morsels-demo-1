It is impossible to love God without loving the cross;  and a heart which has learned to love the cross finds sweetness, joy,  and pleasure even in the bitterest things. \"To the hungry soul every  bitter thing is sweet\" (Prov. xxvii. 7), because it is as hungry for the  cross as it is hungry for God.    The cross gives God, and God gives the cross. Abandonment and the cross  go together. As soon as you are sensible that something is repugnant to  you which presents itself to you in the light of suffering, abandon  yourself at once to God for that very thing, and present yourself as a  sacrifice to Him: you will see that, when the cross comes, it will have  lost much of its weight, because you will desire it. This will not  prevent your being sensible of its weight. Some people imagine that it  is not suffering to feel the cross. The feeling of suffering is one of  the principal parts of suffering itself. Jesus Himself was willing to  suffer it in its intensity.    Often the cross is borne with weakness, at other times with strength:  all should be equal in the will of God.          CHAPTER VII.    ON MYSTERIES--GOD GIVES THEM HERE IN REALITY.      It will be objected that, by this way, mysteries will not be made known.  It is just the contrary; they are given to the soul in reality. Jesus  Christ, to whom it is abandoned, and whom it follows as the _Way_, whom  it hears as the _Truth_, and who animates it as the _Life_, impressing  Himself upon it, imparts to it His own condition.    To bear the conditions of Christ is something far greater than merely to  consider those conditions. Paul bore the conditions of Christ on his  body. \"I bear in my body,\" he says, \"the marks of the Lord Jesus\" (Gal.  vi. 17). But he does not say that he reasoned about them.    Often Christ gives in this state of abandonment views of His conditions  in a striking manner. We must receive equally all the dispositions in  which He may be pleased to place us, choosing for ourselves to abide  near to Him, and to be annihilated before Him, but receiving equally all  that He gives us, light or darkness, facility or barrenness, strength or  weakness, sweetness or bitterness, temptations or distractions, sorrow,  care, uncertainty; none of these things ought to move us.    There are some persons to whom God is continually revealing His  mysteries: let them be faithful to them. But when God sees fit to remove  them, let them suffer them to be taken.    Others are troubled because no mysteries are made known to them: this is  needless, since a loving attention to God includes all particular  devotion, and that which is united to God alone, by its rest in Him, is  instructed in a most excellent manner in all mysteries. He who loves God  loves all that is of Him.          CHAPTER VIII.    ON VIRTUE--ALL VIRTUES GIVEN WITH GOD IN THIS DEGREE OF THE PRAYER OF  THE HEART.      This is the short and the sure way of acquiring virtue; because, God  being the principle of all virtue, we possess all virtue in possessing  God.    More than this, I say that all virtue which is not given inwardly is a  mask of virtue, and like a garment that can be taken off, and will wear  out. But virtue communicated fundamentally is essential, true, and  permanent. \"The King's daughter is all glorious within\" (Ps. xlv. 13).  And there are none who practise virtue more constantly than those who  acquire it in this way, though virtue is not a distinct subject of their  thought.    How hungry these loving ones are after suffering! They think only of  what can please their Beloved, and they begin to neglect themselves, and  to think less of themselves. The more they love God, the more they hate  themselves.    Oh, if all could learn this method, so easy that it is suited for all,  for the most ignorant as for the most learned, how easily the whole  Church would be reformed! You only need to love. St Augustine says,  \"Love, and do as you please;\" for when we love perfectly, we shall not  desire to do anything that could be displeasing to our Beloved.          CHAPTER IX.    OF PERFECT CONVERSION, WHICH IS AN EFFECT OF THIS METHOD OF PRAYER--TWO  OF ITS AIDS, THE ATTRACTION OF GOD, AND THE CENTRAL INCLINATION OF THE  SOUL.      \"Turn ye unto Him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted\"  (Isa. xxxi. 6). Conversion is nothing else but a turning from the  creature to God. Conversion is not perfect, though it is necessary for  salvation, when it is merely a turning from sin to grace. To be  complete, it must be a turning from without to within.    The soul, being turned in the direction of God, has a great facility for  remaining converted to Him. The longer it is converted, the nearer it  approaches to God, and attaches itself to Him; and the nearer it  approaches to God, the more it becomes necessarily drawn from the  creature, which is opposed to God.    But this cannot be done by a violent effort of the creature; all that it  can do is to remain turned in the direction of God in a perpetual  adherence.    God has an _attracting virtue_, which draws the soul more strongly  towards Himself; and in attracting it, He purifies it: as we see the sun  attracting a dense vapour, and gradually, without any other effort on  the part of the vapour than that of letting itself be drawn, the sun, by  bringing it near to himself, refines and purifies it.    There is, however, this difference, that the vapour is not drawn freely,  and does not follow willingly, as is the case with the soul.    This manner of turning within is very simple, and makes the soul advance  naturally and without effort; because God is its centre. The centre has  always a strong attractive power; and the larger the centre, the  stronger is its attractive force.    Besides this attraction of the centre, there is given to all natural  objects a strong tendency to become united with their centre. As soon as  anything is turned in the direction of its centre, unless it be stopped  by some invincible obstacle, it rushes towards it with extreme  velocity. A stone in the air is no sooner let loose, and turned towards  the earth, than it tends to it by its own weight as its centre. It is  the same with fire and water, which, being no longer arrested, run  incessantly towards their centre.    Now I say that the soul, by the effort it has made in inward  recollection, being turned towards its centre, without any other effort,  but simply by the weight of love, falls towards its centre; and the more  it remains quiet and at rest, making no movement of its own, the more  rapidly it will advance, because it thus allows that attractive virtue  to draw it.    All the care, then, that we need have is to promote this inward  recollection as much as possible, not being astonished at the difficulty  we may find in this exercise, which will soon be recompensed with a  wonderful co-operation on the part of God, which will render it very  easy. When the passions rise, a look towards God, who is present within  us, easily deadens them. Any other resistance would irritate rather than  appease them.          CHAPTER X.    HIGHER DEGREE OF PRAYER, WHICH IS THAT OF THE SIMPLE PRESENCE OF GOD, OR  ACTIVE CONTEMPLATION.      The soul, faithfully exercising itself in the affection and love of its  God, is astonished to find Him taking complete possession of it.    His presence becomes so natural, that it would be impossible not to have  it: it becomes habitual to the soul, which is also conscious of a great  calm spreading over it. Its prayer is all silence, and God imparts to it  an intrinsic love, which is the commencement of ineffable happiness.    Oh, if I could describe the infinite degrees which follow! But I must  stop here, since I am writing for beginners, and wait till God shall  bring to light what may be useful to those more advanced.[1] I can only  say, that, at this point, it is most important that all natural  operation should cease, that God may act alone: \"Be still, and know that  I am God,\" is His own word by David (Ps. xlvi. 10).      1. This subject is pursued in the treatise entitled \"Spiritual       Torrents.\"    But man is so attached to his own works, that he cannot believe God is  working, unless he can feel, know, and distinguish His operation. He  does not see that it is the speed of his course which prevents his  seeing the extent of his advancement; and that the operation of God  becoming more abundant, absorbs that of the creature, as we see that the  sun, in proportion as he rises, absorbs the light of the stars, which  were easily distinguishable before he appeared. It is not the want of  light, but an excess of light, which prevents our distinguishing the  stars.    It is the same here; man can no longer distinguish his own operation,  because the strong light absorbs all his little distinct lights, and  makes them fade away entirely, because God's excess surpasses them all.  So that those who accuse this degree of prayer of being a state of  _idleness_, are greatly deceived; and only speak thus from want of  experience. Oh, if they would only prove it! in how short a time they  would become experimentally acquainted with this matter!    I say, then, that this failure of work does not spring from scarcity,  but from abundance.    Two classes of persons are silent: the one because they have nothing to  say, the other because they have too much. It is thus in this degree. We  are silent from excess, not from want.    Water causes death to two persons in very different ways. One dies of  thirst, another is drowned: the one dies from want, the other from  abundance. So here it is abundance which causes the cessation of natural  operation. It is therefore important in this degree to remain as much as  possible in stillness.    At the commencement of this prayer, a movement of affection is  necessary; but when grace begins to flow into us, we have nothing to do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25"],[0,"The 1991 CIA World Factbook (#4)"],[1,"s, Eastern Europe, the USSR,  and selected other countries.

Economic considerations, however,  have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals, including  the nine-year Soviet military occupation (ended 15 February 1989) and the  continuing bloody civil war. Over the past decade, one-third of the  population has fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering about 3.3  million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another 1 million have  probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Large  numbers of bridges, buildings, and factories have been destroyed or  damaged by military action or sabotage.
