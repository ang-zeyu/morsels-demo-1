[Illustration: p045-56]    Mark you, I strongly suspect the rascal cares as little for God, as for  the rest; but women do not look so closely. They are easily caught by  a birdlime of words, and every time Amaury recites his _Credo of Love_,  you are certain to see all round the drawing-room rows upon rows of  little rosy mouths, eagerly opening, ready to swallow the taking bait  of mawkish sentimentality. Just fancy! A poet who has such beautiful  moustaches and who believes in love as he believes in God.    For the nurseryman's wife this proved indeed irresistible. In three  sittings she was conquered. Only, as at the bottom of this elegiac  nature there was some honesty and pride, she would not stoop to any  paltry fault. Moreover the poet himself declared in his _Credo_, that  he only understood one way of erring: that which was openly declared and  ready to defy both law and society. Taking therefore the _Credo of Love_  for her guide, the young woman one fine day escaped from the garden at  Auteuil and went off to throw herself into her poet's arms.--\"I can no  longer live with that man! Take me away!\"    In such cases the husband is always _that man_, even when he is a  horticulturist.    For a moment Amaury was staggered. How on earth could he have imagined  that an ordinary little housewife of thirty would have taken in earnest  a love poem, and followed it out literally? However he put the best face  he could on his over-good fortune, and as the lady had, thanks to her  little Auteuil garden, remained fresh and pretty, he carried her off  without a murmur. The first days, all was delightful. They feared lest  the husband should track them. They thought it advisable to hide under  fictitious names, change hotels, inhabit the most remote quarters of the  town, the suburbs of Paris, the outlying districts.    [Illustration: p047-058]    In the evening they stealthily sallied forth and took sentimental walks  along the fortifications. Oh the wonderful power of romance! The more  she was alarmed, the more precautions, window blinds and lowered veils,  were necessary, the greater did her poet seem. At night, they opened the  little window of their room and gazing at the stars rising on high above  the signal lights of the neighbouring railway, she made him repeat again  and again his wonderful verses:         Moi, je crois a l'amour comme je crois en Dieu.    And it was delightful!    [Illustration: p048-059]    Unfortunately it did not last. The husband left them too much  undisturbed. The fact is, _that man_ was a philosopher. His wife gone,  he had closed the green door of his oasis and quietly set about trimming  his roses again, happy in the thought that these at least, attached  to the soil by long roots, would not be able to run away from him. Our  reassured lovers returned to Paris and then suddenly the young woman  felt that some change had come over her poet. Their flight, fear of  detection, and constant alarms,--all these things which had fed  her passion existing no longer, she began to understand and see the  situation clearly.    [Illustration: p049-060]    Moreover, at every moment, in the settling of their little household,  in the thousand paltry details of every day life, the man she was living  with showed himself more thoroughly.    The few and scarce generous, heroic or delicate feelings he possessed  were spun out in his verses, and he kept none for his personal use.  He was mean, selfish, above all very niggardly, a fault love seldom  forgives. Then he had cut off his moustaches, and was disfigured by  the loss. How different from that fine gloomy fellow with his carefully  curled locks, as he appeared one evening declaiming his _Credo_, in the  blaze of two chandeliers! Now, in the enforced retreat he was undergoing  on her account, he gave way to all his crotchets, the greatest of which  was fancying himself always ill. Indeed, from constantly playing at  consumption, one ends by believing in it. The poet Amaury was fond of  decoctions, wrapped himself up in plaisters, and covered his chimney  piece with phials and powders. For some time the little woman took up  quite seriously her part of a nursing sister. Her devotion seemed to  excuse her fault and give an object to her life. But she soon tired of  it. In spite of herself, in the stuffy room where the poet sat wrapped  in flannel, she could not help thinking of her little garden so sweetly  scented, and the kind nurseryman seen from afar in the midst of  his shrubs and flowerbeds, appeared to her as simple, touching and  disinterested, as this other one was exacting and egotistical.    At the end of a month, she loved her husband, really loved him, not with  the affection induced by habit, but with a real and true love. One day  she wrote him a long letter full of passion and repentance. He did  not vouchsafe a reply. Perhaps he thought she was not yet sufficiently  punished. Then she despatched letter after letter, humbled herself,  begged him to allow her to return, saying she would die rather than  continue to live with that man. It was now the lover's turn to be called  \"that man.\" Strange to say, she hid herself from him to write; for  she believed him still in love, and while imploring her husband's  forgiveness, she feared the exaltation of her lover.    \"He will never allow me to leave,\" she said to herself.  Accordingly, when by dint of supplications she obtained forgiveness  and the nurseryman--I have already mentioned that he was a  philosopher,--consented to take her back, the return to her own home  bore all the mysterious and dramatic aspect of flight. She literally  eloped with her husband. It was her last culpable pleasure. One evening  as the poet, tired of their dual existence, and proud of his regrown  moustaches, had gone to an evening party to recite his _Credo of Love_,  she jumped into a cab that was awaiting her at the end of the street and  returned with her old husband to the little garden at Auteuil, for ever  cured of her ambition to be the wife of a poet. It is true that this  fellow was not much of a poet!    [Illustration: p055-066]          THE TRANSTEVERINA.    The play was just over, and while the crowd, with its many varied  impressions, hurried away and poured out under the glare of the  principal portico of the theatre, a few friends, of whom I was one,  awaited the poet at the artists' entrance in order to congratulate him.  His production had not, indeed, been very successful. Too powerful to  suit the timid and trivial imagination of the public of our day, it  was quite beyond the range of the stage, limited as that is by  conventionalities and tolerated traditions. Pedantic criticism declared:  \"It is not fit for the stage!\" and the scoffers of the boulevards  revenged themselves for the emotion these magnificent verses had given  them by repeating: \"It won't pay!\" As for us, we were proud of the  friend who had dared to roll forth in a ringing peal, his splendid  golden rhymes, flashing the best product of his genius beneath the  artificial and murderous light of the lustres, and presenting his  personages in life-like size, heedless of the optical illusion of the  modern stage, of the dimness of opera-glass and defective vision.    Amid a motley crowd of scene shifters, firemen, and _figurants_ muffled  up in comforters, the poet approached us, his tall figure bent double,  his coat collar chillily turned up over his thin beard and long grizzled  hair. He seemed depressed. The scant applause of the hired claque and  literary friends confined to a corner of the house foretold a limited  number of representations, choice and rare spectators, and posters  rapidly replaced without giving his name a chance of being known. When  one has worked twenty of talent and life, this obstinate refusal of  the public to comprehend is wearying and disheartening, and one ends by  thinking: \"Perhaps after all they are right.\" Fear paralyses and words  fail. Our acclamations and enthusiastic greetings somewhat cheered him.  \"Really do you think so? Is it well done? 'Tis true I have given all I  knew.\" And his feverish hands anxiously clutched ours, his eyes full  of tears sought a sincere and reassuring glance. It was the imploring  anguish of the sick person, asking the doctor: \"It is not true, I'm  not going to die?\" No! poet, you will not die. The operettas and fairy  pieces that have had hundreds of representations and thousands of  spectators will be long since forgotten, scattered to the winds with  their last playbills, while your work will ever remain fresh and living.    As we stood on the now deserted pavement, exhorting and cheering him, a  loud contralto voice vulgarised by an Italian accent burst upon us.    \"Hullo, artist! enough _pouegie_. Let's go and eat the _estoufato!_\"    [Illustration: p058-069]    At the same moment a stout woman wrapped up in a hooded cape and a red  tartan shawl linked her arm in that of our friend, in a manner so  brutal and despotic that his countenance and attitude became at once  embarrassed.    \"My wife,\" he said, then turning towards her with a hesitating smile:    \"Suppose we take them home and show them how you make an _estoufato?_\"    Flattered in the conceit of her culinary accomplishments, the Italian  graciously consented to receive us, and five or six of us started off  for the heights of Montmartre where they dwelt, to share their stewed  beef.    I confess I took a certain interest in the artist's home life. Since his  marriage our friend had led a very secluded existence, almost always in  the country; but what I knew of his life whetted my curiosity. Fifteen  years before, when in all the freshness of a romantic imagination,  he had met in the suburbs of Rome a magnificent creature with whom he  immediately fell desperately in love.

There they got American treatment and as far as possible food  cooked in American style.    In October the number of sick and wounded men was so large that another  hospital for the exclusive use of convalescents was opened in an old  Russian sailor's home in the near vicinity of American Headquarters.

Let it be understood right here that many a British  officer was decorated with insignia of high rank but drew pay of low  rank. It was actually done over and over again to give the British  officer ranking authority over the American officers.    What American doughboy who ever went through the old 53rd Stationary  hospital will ever forget his homesickness and feeling of outrage at the  treatment by the perhaps well-meaning but nevertheless callous and  coarse British personnel. Think of tea, jam and bread for sick and  wounded men. An American medical sergeant who has often eaten with the  British sergeants at that hospital, Sergeant Glenn Winslow, who made out  the medical record for every wounded and sick man of the Americans who  went through the various hospitals at Archangel, and who was frequently  present at the British sergeant's mess at the hospital, relates that  there were plenty of fine foods and delicacies and drink for the  sergeant's messes, corroborated by Mess Sgt. Vincent of. \"F\" Company.  And a similar story was told by an American medical officer who was  invalided home in charge of over fifty wounded Americans. He had often  heard that the comforts and delicacies among the British hospital  supplies went to the British officers' messes. Captain Pyle was in  command on the icebreaker \"Canada\" and saw to it that the limited supply  of delicacies went to the wounded men most in need of it. There were  several British officers on the icebreaker enroute to Murmansk who set  up a pitiful cry that they had seen none of the extras to which they  were accustomed, thinking doubtless that the American officer was  holding back on them. Captain Pyle on the big ship out of Murmansk took  occasion to request of the British skipper that the American wounded on  board the ship be given more food and more palatable food. He was asked  if he expected more for the doughboy than was given to the Tommie. The  American officer's reply was characteristic of the difference between  the attitude of British and American officers toward the enlisted man:    \"No, sir, it is not a question of different treatment as between Tommie  and doughboy. It is difference in the feeding of the wounded and sick  American officers and the feeding of wounded and sick American enlisted  men. My government makes no such great difference. I demand that my  American wounded men be fed more like the way in which the officers on  this ship are fed.\"    Lest we forget, this same medical officer in charge at one time of a  temporary hospital at a key point in the field, was over-ranked and put  under a British medical officer who brought about the American officer's  recall to the base because he refused to put the limited American  medical personnel of enlisted men to digging latrines for the British  officers' quarters.    Many a man discharged from the British 53rd Stationary Hospital as fit  for duty, was examined by American medical officers and put either into  our own Red Cross Hospital or into the American Convalescent Hospital  for proper treatment and nourishment back to fighting condition. It was  openly charged by the Americans that several Americans in the British  hospital were neglected till they were bedsore and their lives  endangered. Sick and wounded men were required to do orderly work. When  a sturdy American corporal refused to do work or to supervise work of  that nature in the hospital, he was court-martialed by order of the  American colonel commanding the American forces in North Russia. Of  course it must needs be said that there were many fine men among the  British medical officers and enlisted personnel. But what they did to  serve the American doughboys was overborne by the mistreatment of the  others.    Finally no more wounded Americans were sent to the British hospital and  no sick except those sick under G. O. 45. These latter found themselves  cooped up in an old Russian prison, partially cleaned up for a hospital  ward. This was a real chamber of horrors to many an unfortunate soldier  who was buffetted from hospital to Major Young's summary court to  hospital or back to the guardhouse, all the while worrying about the  ineffectiveness of his treatment.    So the American soldiers at last got their own receiving hospital and  their own convalescent hospital. Of course at the fighting fronts they  were nearly always in the hands of their own American medical officers  and enlisted men. The bright story of the Convalescent Hospital appears  in another place. This receiving hospital was a fine old building which  one time had been a meteorological institute, a Russian imperial  educational institution. Its great stone exterior had gathered a  venerable look in its two hundred years. The Americans were to give its  interior a sanitary improvement by way of a set of modern plumbing. But  the thing that pleased the wounded doughboy most was to find himself,  when in dreadful need of the probe or knife, under the familiar and  understanding and sympathetic eyes of Majors Henry or Longley or some  other American officer, to find his wants answered by an enlisted man  who knew the slang of Broadway and Hamtramck and the small town slang of  \"back home in Michigan, down on the farm,\" and to find his food cooked  and served as near as possible like it was \"back home\" to a sick man.  Blessings on the medical men!        II    FALL OFFENSIVE ON THE RAILROAD    Third Battalion Hurries From Troopship To Troop-Train Bound For  Obozerskaya--We Relieve Wearied French Battalion--\"We Are Fighting An  Offensive War\"--First Engagement--Memorable Night March Ends At Edge Of  Lake--Our Enemy Compels Respect At Verst 458--American Major Hangs  On--Successful Flank March Takes Verst 455--Front Line Is Set At 445 By  Dashing Attack--We Hold It Despite Severe Bombardments And Heavy  Assaults.    On the afternoon of September the fifth the 3rd Battalion of the 339th  Infantry debarked hurriedly at Bakaritza. Doughboys marched down the  gangplank with their full field equipment ready for movement to the  fighting front. Somewhere deep in the forest beyond that skyline of pine  tree tops a handful of French and Scots and American sailors were  battling the Bolos for their lives. The anxiety of the British staff  officer--we know it was one of General Poole's staff, for we remember  the red band on his cap, was evidenced by his impatience to get the  Americans aboard the string of tiny freight cars.    Doughboys stretched their sea legs comfortably and formed in column of  squads under the empty supply shed on the quay, to escape the cold  drizzle of rain, while Major Young explained in detail how Captain  Donoghue was to conduct the second train.    All night long the two troop trains rattled along the Russki railway or  stood interminably at strange-looking stations. The bare box cars were  corded deep with sitting and curled up soldiers fitfully sleeping and  starting to consciousness at the jerking and swaying of the train. Once  at a weird log station by the flaring torchlights they had stood for a  few minutes beside a northbound train loaded with Bolshevik prisoners  and deserters gathered in that day after the successful Allied  engagement. Morning found them at a big bridge that had been destroyed  by artillery fire of the Red Guards the afternoon before, not far from  the important village of Obozerskaya, a vital keypoint which just now we  were to endeavor to organize the defense of, and use as a depot and  junction point for other forces.    No one who was there will forget the initial scene at Obozerskaya when  two companies of Americans, \"I\" and \"L\", proceeded' up the railroad  track in column of twos and halted in ranks before the tall station  building, with their battalion commander holding officers call at  command of the bugle. An excited little French officer popped out of his  dugout and pointed at the shell holes in the ground and in the station  and spoke a terse phrase in French to the British field staff officer  who was gnawing his mustache. The latter overcame his embarrassment  enough to tell Major Young that the French officer feared the Bolo any  minute would reopen artillery fire. Then we realized we were in the  fighting zone. The major shouted orders out and shooed the platoons off  into the woods.    Later into the woods the French officers led the Americans who relieved  them of their circle of fortified outposts. Some few in the vicinity of  the scattered village made use of buildings, but most"]]]
