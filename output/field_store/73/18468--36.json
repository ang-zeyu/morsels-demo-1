Well, I need only tell him that I was mistaken, and fix his wandering  suspicions upon any man whatever, and I shall take him away from you,  even as I have brought him back. I need give you no proof of what I say;  you know perfectly well that I am speaking the truth.\"    \"And what object had you, in acting this part?\"    \"To prove to you, madame, that at my will I can cause you to be sad or  joyful, cherished or neglected, adored or hated. Madame, listen to me: I  love you.\"    \"You insult me, monsieur!\" cried the marquise, trying to withdraw the  bridle of her horse from the abbe's hands.    \"No fine words, my dear sister-in-law; for, with me, I warn you, they  will be lost. To tell a woman one loves her is never an insult; only  there are a thousand different ways of obliging her to respond to that  love. The error is to make a mistake in the way that one employs--that  is the whole of the matter.\"    \"And may I inquire which you have chosen?\" asked the marquise, with a  crushing smile of contempt.    \"The only one that could succeed with a calm, cold, strong woman like  you, the conviction that your interest requires you to respond to my  love.\"    \"Since you profess to know me so well,\" answered the marquise, with  another effort, as unsuccessful as the former, to free the bridle of her  horse, \"you should know how a woman like me would receive such an  overture; say to yourself what I might say to you, and above all, what I  might say to my husband.\"    The abbe smiled.    \"Oh, as to that,\" he returned, \"you can do as you please, madame. Tell  your husband whatever you choose; repeat our conversation word for word;  add whatever your memory may furnish, true or false, that may be most  convincing against me; then, when you have thoroughly given him his cue,  when you think yourself sure of him, I will say two words to him, and  turn him inside out like this glove. That is what I had to say to you,  madame I will not detain you longer. You may have in me a devoted friend  or a mortal enemy. Reflect.\"    At these words the abbe loosed his hold upon the bridle of the  marquise's horse and left her free to guide it as she would. The  marquise put her beast to a trot, so as to show neither fear nor haste.  The abbe followed her, and both rejoined the hunt.    The abbe had spoken truly. The marquise, notwithstanding the threat  which she had made, reflected upon the influence which this man had over  her husband, and of which she had often had proof she kept silence,  therefore, and hoped that he had made himself seem worse than he was, to  frighten her. On this point she was strangely mistaken.    The abbe, however, wished to see, in the first place, whether the  marquise's refusal was due to personal antipathy or to real virtue. The  chevalier, as has been said, was handsome; he had that usage of good  society which does instead of mind, and he joined to it the obstinacy of  a stupid man; the abbe undertook to persuade him that he was in love  with the marquise. It was not a difficult matter. We have described the  impression made upon the chevalier by the first sight of Madame de  Ganges; but, owing beforehand the reputation of austerity that his  sister-in-law had acquired, he had not the remotest idea of paying court  to her. Yielding, indeed, to the influence which she exercised upon all  who came in contact with her, the chevalier had remained her devoted  servant; and the marquise, having no reason to mistrust civilities which  she took for signs of friendliness, and considering his position as her  husband's brother, treated him with less circumspection than was her  custom.    The abbe sought him out, and, having made sure they were alone, said,  \"Chevalier, we both love the same woman, and that woman is our brother's  wife; do not let us thwart each other: I am master of my passion, and  can the more easily sacrifice it to you that I believe you are the man  preferred; try, therefore, to obtain some assurance of the love which I  suspect the marquise of having for you; and from the day when you reach  that point I will withdraw, but otherwise, if you fail, give up your  place civilly to me, that I may try, in my turn, whether her heart is  really impregnable, as everybody says.\"    The chevalier had never thought of the possibility of winning the  marquise; but from the moment in which his brother, with no apparent  motive of personal interest, aroused the idea that he might be beloved,  every spark of passion and of vanity that still existed in this  automaton took fire, and he began to be doubly assiduous and attentive  to his sister-in-law. She, who had never suspected any evil in this  quarter, treated the chevalier at first with a kindliness that was  heightened by her scorn for the abbe. But, before long, the chevalier,  misunderstanding the grounds of this kindliness, explained himself more  clearly. The marquise, amazed and at first incredulous, allowed him to  say enough to make his intentions perfectly clear; then she stopped him,  as she had done the abbe, by some of those galling words which women  derive from their indifference even more than from their virtue.    At this check, the chevalier, who was far from possessing his brother's  strength and determination, lost all hope, and came candidly to own to  the latter the sad result of his attentions and his love. This was what  the abbe had awaited, in the first place for the satisfaction of his own  vanity, and in the second place for the means of carrying out his  schemes. He worked upon the chevalier's humiliation until he had wrought  it into a solid hatred; and then, sure of having him for a supporter and  even for an accomplice, he began to put into execution his plan against  the marquise.    The consequence was soon shown in a renewal of alienation on the part of  M. de Ganges. A young man whom the marquise sometimes met in society,  and to whom, on account of his wit, she listened perhaps a little more  willingly than to others, became, if not the cause, at least the excuse  of a fresh burst of jealousy. This jealousy was exhibited as on previous  occasions, by quarrels remote from the real grievance; but the marquise  was not deceived: she recognised in this change the fatal hand of her  brother-in-law. But this certainty, instead of drawing her towards him,  increased her repulsion; and thenceforward she lost no opportunity of  showing him not only that repulsion but also the contempt that  accompanied it.    Matters remained in this state for some months. Every day the marquise  perceived her husband growing colder, and although the spies were  invisible she felt herself surrounded by a watchfulness that took note  of the most private details of her life. As to the abbe and the  chevalier, they were as usual; only the abbe had hidden his hate behind  a smile that was habitual, and the chevalier his resentment behind that  cold and stiff dignity in which dull minds enfold themselves when they  believe themselves injured in their vanity.    In the midst of all this, M. Joannis de Nocheres died, and added to the  already considerable fortune of his granddaughter another fortune of  from six to seven hundred thousand livres.    This additional wealth became, on accruing to the marquise, what was  then called, in countries where the Roman law prevailed, a 'paraphernal'  estate that is to say that, falling in, after marriage? it was not  included in the dowry brought by the wife, and that she could dispose  freely both of the capital and the income, which might not be  administered even by her husband without a power of attorney, and of  which she could dispose at pleasure, by donation or by will. And in  fact, a few days after the marquise had entered into possession of her  grandfather's estate, her husband and his brothers learned that she had  sent for a notary in order to be instructed as to her rights. This step  betokened an intention of separating this inheritance from the common  property of the marriage; for the behaviour of the marquis towards his  wife--of which within himself he often recognised the injustice--left  him little hope of any other explanation.    About this time a strange event happened. At a dinner given by the  marquise, a cream was served at dessert: all those who partook of this  cream were ill; the marquis and his two brothers, who had not touched  it, felt no evil effects. The remainder of this cream, which was  suspected of having caused illness to the guests, and particularly to  the marquise, who had taken of it twice, was analysed, and the presence  of arsenic in it demonstrated. Only, having been mixed with milk, which  is its antidote, the poison had lost some of its power, and had produced  but half the expected effect. As no serious disaster had followed this  occurrence, the blame was thrown upon a servant, who was said to have  mistaken arsenic for sugar, and everybody forgot it, or appeared to  forget it.    The marquis, however, seemed to be gradually and naturally drawing  nearer again to his wife; but this time Madame de Ganges was not  deceived by his returning kindness. There, as in his alienation, she saw  the selfish hand of the abbe: he had persuaded his brother that seven  hundred thousand livres more in the house would make it worth while to  overlook some levities of behaviour; and the marquis, obeying the  impulse given, was trying, by kind dealing, to oppose his wife's still  unsettled intention of making a will.    Towards the autumn there was talk of going to spend that season at  Ganges, a little town situated in Lower Languedoc, in the diocese of  Montpellier, seven leagues from that town, and nineteen from Avignon.  Although this was natural enough, since the marquis was lord of the town  and had a castle there, the marquise was seized "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#4)"],[1,"desire more--much more--than he possesses.\"    \"I said that I was contented, monsieur; but, perhaps, I deceive myself.  I am ignorant of the nature of ambition; but it is not impossible I may  have some. Tell me your mind; that is all I ask.\"    \"An ambitious man,\" said Aramis, \"is one who covets that which is beyond  his station.\"    \"I covet nothing beyond my station,\" said the young man, with an  assurance of manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes  tremble.    He was silent. But to look at the kindling eye, the knitted brow, and  the reflective attitude of the captive, it was evident that he expected  something more than silence,--a silence which Aramis now broke. \"You  lied the first time I saw you,\" said he.    \"Lied!\" cried the young man, starting up on his couch, with such a tone  in his voice, and such a lightning in his eyes, that Aramis recoiled, in  spite of himself.    \"I _should_ say,\" returned Aramis, bowing, \"you concealed from me what  you knew of your infancy.\"    \"A man's secrets are his own, monsieur,\" retorted the prisoner, \"and not  at the mercy of the first chance-comer.\"    \"True,\" said Aramis, bowing still lower than before, \"'tis true; pardon  me, but to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer? I beseech  you to reply, monseigneur.\"    This title slightly disturbed the prisoner; but nevertheless he did not  appear astonished that it was given him. \"I do not know you, monsieur,\"  said he.    \"Oh, but if I dared, I would take your hand and kiss it!\"    The young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand;  but the light which beamed in his eyes faded away, and he coldly and  distrustfully withdrew his hand again. \"Kiss the hand of a prisoner,\" he  said, shaking his head, \"to what purpose?\"    \"Why did you tell me,\" said Aramis, \"that you were happy here? Why, that  you aspired to nothing? Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you prevent  me from being frank in my turn?\"    The same light shone a third time in the young man's eyes, but died  ineffectually away as before.    \"You distrust me,\" said Aramis.    \"And why say you so, monsieur?\"    \"Oh, for a very simple reason; if you know what you ought to know, you  ought to mistrust everybody.\"    \"Then do not be astonished that I am mistrustful, since you suspect me  of knowing what I do not know.\"    Aramis was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance. \"Oh,  monseigneur! you drive me to despair,\" said he, striking the armchair  with his fist.    \"And, on my part, I do not comprehend you, monsieur.\"    \"Well, then, try to understand me.\" The prisoner looked fixedly at  Aramis.    \"Sometimes it seems to me,\" said the latter, \"that I have before me the  man whom I seek, and then--\"    \"And then your man disappears,--is it not so?\" said the prisoner,  smiling. \"So much the better.\"    Aramis rose. \"Certainly,\" said he; \"I have nothing further to say to a  man who mistrusts me as you do.\"    \"And I, monsieur,\" said the prisoner, in the same tone, \"have nothing  to say to a man who will not understand that a prisoner ought to be  mistrustful of everybody.\"    \"Even of his old friends,\" said Aramis. \"Oh, monseigneur, you are _too_  prudent!\"    \"Of my old friends?--you one of my old friends,--you?\"    \"Do you no longer remember,\" said Aramis, \"that you once saw, in the  village where your early years were spent--\"    \"Do you know the name of the village?\" asked the prisoner.    \"Noisy-le-Sec, monseigneur,\" answered Aramis, firmly.    \"Go on,\" said the young man, with an immovable aspect.    \"Stay, monseigneur,\" said Aramis; \"if you are positively resolved to  carry on this game, let us break off. I am here to tell you many things,  'tis true; but you must allow me to see that, on your side, you have  a desire to know them. Before revealing the important matters I still  withhold, be assured I am in need of some encouragement, if not candor;  a little sympathy, if not confidence. But you keep yourself intrenched  in a pretended which paralyzes me. Oh, not for the reason you think;  for, ignorant as you may be, or indifferent as you feign to be, you are  none the less what you are, monseigneur, and there is nothing--nothing,  mark me! which can cause you not to be so.\"    \"I promise you,\" replied the prisoner, \"to hear you without impatience.  Only it appears to me that I have a right to repeat the question I have  already asked, 'Who _are_ you?'\"    \"Do you remember, fifteen or eighteen years ago, seeing at Noisy-le-Sec  a cavalier, accompanied by a lady in black silk, with flame-colored  ribbons in her hair?\"    \"Yes,\" said the young man; \"I once asked the name of this cavalier, and  they told me that he called himself the Abbe d'Herblay. I was astonished  that the abbe had so warlike an air, and they replied that there was  nothing singular in that, seeing that he was one of Louis XIII.'s  musketeers.\"    \"Well,\" said Aramis, \"that musketeer and abbe, afterwards bishop of  Vannes, is your confessor now.\"    \"I know it; I recognized you.\"    \"Then, monseigneur, if you know that, I must further add a fact of which  you are ignorant--that if the king were to know this evening of the  presence of this musketeer, this abbe, this bishop, this confessor,  _here_--he, who has risked everything to visit you, to-morrow would  behold the steely glitter of the executioner's axe in a dungeon more  gloomy, more obscure than yours.\"    While listening to these words, delivered with emphasis, the young  man had raised himself on his couch, and was now gazing more and more  eagerly at Aramis.    The result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some  confidence from it. \"Yes,\" he murmured, \"I remember perfectly. The  woman of whom you speak came once with you, and twice afterwards with  another.\" He hesitated.    \"With another, who came to see you every month--is it not so,  monseigneur?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you know who this lady was?\"    The light seemed ready to flash from the prisoner's eyes. \"I am aware  that she was one of the ladies of the court,\" he said.    \"You remember that lady well, do you not?\"    \"Oh, my recollection can hardly be very confused on this head,\" said the  young prisoner. \"I saw that lady once with a gentleman about forty-five  years old. I saw her once with you, and with the lady dressed in black.  I have seen her twice since then with the same person. These four  people, with my master, and old Perronnette, my jailer, and the governor  of the prison, are the only persons with whom I have ever spoken, and,  indeed, almost the only persons I have ever seen.\"    \"Then you were in prison?\"    \"If I am a prisoner here, then I was comparatively free, although in  a very narrow sense--a house I never quitted, a garden surrounded with  walls I could not climb, these constituted my residence, but you know  it, as you have been there. In a word, being accustomed to live within  these bounds, I never cared to leave them. And so you will understand,  monsieur, that having never seen anything of the world, I have nothing  left to care for; and therefore, if you relate anything, you will be  obliged to explain each item to me as you go along.\"    \"And I will do so,\" said Aramis, bowing; \"for it is my duty,  monseigneur.\"    \"Well, then, begin by telling me who was my tutor.\"    \"A worthy and, above all, an honorable gentleman, monseigneur; fit guide  for both body and soul. Had you ever any reason to complain of him?\"    \"Oh, no; quite the contrary. But this gentleman of yours often used to  tell me that my father and mother were dead. Did he deceive me, or did  he speak the truth?\"    \"He was compelled to comply with the orders given him.\"    \"Then he lied?\"    \"In one respect. Your father is dead.\"    \"And my mother?\"    \"She is dead _for you_.\"    \"But then she lives for others, does she not?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And I--and I, then\" (the young man looked sharply at Aramis) \"am  compelled to live in the obscurity of a prison?\"    \"Alas! I fear so.\"    \"And that because my presence in the world would lead to the revelation  of a great secret?\"    \"Certainly, a very great secret.\"    \"My enemy must indeed be powerful, to be able to shut up in the Bastile  a child such as I then was.\"    \"He is.\"    \"More powerful than my mother, then?\"    \"And why do you ask that?\"    \"Because my mother would have taken my part.\"    Aramis hesitated. \"Yes, monseigneur; more powerful than your mother.\"    \"Seeing, then, that my nurse and preceptor were carried off, and that I,  also, was separated from them--either they were, or I am, very dangerous  to my enemy?\"    \"Yes; but you are alluding to a peril from which he freed himself, by  causing the nurse and preceptor to disappear,\" answered Aramis, quietly.    \"Disappear!\" cried the prisoner, \"how did they disappear?\"    \"In a very sure way,\" answered Aramis--\"they are dead.\"    The young man turned pale, and passed his hand tremblingly over his  face. \"Poison?\" he asked.    \"Poison.\"    The prisoner reflected a moment. \"My enemy must indeed have been very  cruel, or hard beset by necessity, to assassinate those two innocent  people, my sole support; for the worthy gentleman and the poor nurse had  never harmed a living being.\"    \"In your family, monseigneur, necessity is stern. And so it is necessity  which compels me, to my great regret, to tell you that this gentleman  and the unhappy lady have been assassinated.\"    \"Oh, you tell me nothing I am not aware of,\" said the prisoner, knitting  his brows.    \"How?\"    \"I suspected it.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I will tell you.\"    At this moment the young man, supporting himself on his two elbows,  drew close to Aramis's face, with such an expression of dignity, of  self-command and of defiance even, that the bishop felt the electricity  of enthusiasm strike in devouring flashes from that great heart of his,  into his brain of adamant.    \"Speak, monseigneur. I have already told you that by conversing with you  I"]]]
