He was occupied with turning over the dry leaves, one after  another,--hunting for cocoons, or things of that sort, I suppose. Twice  he found what he was in search of; but instead of handling the leaf on  the ground, he flew with it to the trunk of an elm, wedged it into a  crevice of the bark, and proceeded to hammer it sharply with his beak.  Great is the power of habit! Strange--is it not?--that any bird should  find it easiest to do such work while clinging to a perpendicular  surface! Yes; but how does it look to a dog, I wonder, that men can walk  better on their hind legs than on all fours? Everything is a miracle  from somebody's point of view. The sparrows were inclined to make game  of my obliging little performer; but he would have none of their  insolence, and repelled every approach in dashing style. In exactly  three weeks from this time, and on the same hillside, I came upon  another nuthatch similarly employed; but before this one had turned up a  leaf to his mind, the sparrows became literally too many for him, and he  took flight,--to my no small disappointment.    It would be unfair not to name others of my city guests, even though I  have nothing in particular to record concerning them. The Wilson thrush  and the red-bellied nuthatch I have seen once or twice each. The chewink  is more constant in his visits, as is also the golden-winged woodpecker.  Our familiar little downy woodpecker, on the other hand, has thus far  kept out of my catalogue. No other bird's absence has surprised me so  much; and it is the more remarkable because the comparatively rare  yellow-bellied species is to be met with nearly every season.  Cedar-birds show themselves irregularly. One March morning, when the  ground was covered with snow, a flock of perhaps a hundred collected in  one of the taller maples in the Garden, till the tree looked from a  distance like an autumn hickory, its leafless branches still thickly  dotted with nuts. Four days afterward, what seemed to be the same  company made their appearance in the Common. Of the flycatchers, I have  noted the kingbird, the least flycatcher, and the phoebe. The two  former stay to breed. Twice in the fall I have found a kingfisher about  the Frog Pond. Once the fellow sprung his watchman's rattle. He was  perhaps my most unexpected caller, and for a minute or so I was not  entirely sure whether indeed I was in Boston or not. The blue jay and  the crow know too much to be caught in such a place, although one may  often enough see the latter passing overhead. Every now and then, in the  traveling season, a stray sandpiper or two will be observed teetering  round the edge of the Common and Garden ponds; and one day, when the  latter was drained, I saw quite a flock of some one of the smaller  species feeding over its bottom. Very picturesque they were, feeding and  flying in close order. Besides these must be mentioned the  yellow-throated vireo, the bay-winged bunting, the swamp sparrow, the  field sparrow, the purple finch, the red-poll linnet, the savanna  sparrow, the tree sparrow, the night-hawk (whose celebrated tumbling  trick may often be witnessed by evening strollers in the Garden), the  woodcock (I found the body of one which had evidently met its death  against the electric wire), and among the best of all, the chickadees,  who sometimes make the whole autumn cheerful with their presence, but  about whom I say nothing here because I have said so much elsewhere.    Of fugitive cage-birds, I recall only five--all in the Garden. One of  these, feeding tamely in the path, I suspected for an English robin but  he was not in full plumage, and my conjecture may have been incorrect.  Another was a diminutive finch, dressed in a suit of red, blue, and  green. He sat in a bush, saying _No, no!_ to a feline admirer who was  making love to him earnestly. The others were a mocking-bird, a cardinal  grosbeak, and a paroquet. The mocking-bird and the grosbeak might  possibly have been wild, had the question been one of latitude simply,  but their demeanor satisfied me to the contrary. The former's awkward  attempt at alighting on the tip of a fence-picket seemed evidence enough  that he had not been long at large. The paroquet was a splendid  creature, with a brilliant orange throat darkly spotted. He flew from  tree to tree, chattering gayly, and had a really pretty song. Evidently  he was in the best of spirits, notwithstanding the rather obtrusive  attentions of a crowd of house sparrows, who appeared to look upon such  a wearer of the green as badly out of place in this new England of  theirs. But for all his vivacity, I feared he would not be long in  coming to grief. If he escaped other perils, the cold weather must soon  overtake him, for it was now the middle of September, and his last state  would be worse than his first. He had better have kept his cage; unless,  indeed, he was one of the nobler spirits that prefer death to slavery.    Of all the birds thus far named, very few seemed to attract the  attention of anybody except myself. But there remains one other, whom I  have reserved for the last, not because he was in himself the noblest or  the most interesting (though he was perhaps the biggest), but because,  unlike the rest, he did succeed in winning the notice of the multitude.  In fact, my one owl, to speak theatrically, made a decided hit; for a  single afternoon he may be said to have been famous,--or at all events  notorious, if any old-fashioned reader be disposed to insist upon this  all but obsolete distinction. His triumph, such as it was, had already  begun when I first discovered him, for he was then perched well up in an  elm, while a mob of perhaps forty men and boys were pelting him with  sticks and stones. Even in the dim light of a cloudy November afternoon  he seemed quite bewildered and helpless, making no attempt to escape,  although the missiles were flying past him on all sides. The most he did  was to shift his perch when he was hit, which, to be sure, happened  pretty often. Once he was struck so hard that he came tumbling toward  the ground, and I began to think it was all over with him; but when  about half-way down he recovered himself, and by dint of painful  flappings succeeded in alighting just out of the reach of the crowd. At  once there were loud cries: \"Don't kill him! Don't kill him!\" and while  the scamps were debating what to do next, he regained his breath, and  flew up into the tree again, as high as before. Then the stoning began  anew. For my part I pitied the fellow sincerely, and wished him well out  of the hands of his tormentors; but I found myself laughing with the  rest to see him turn his head and stare, with his big, vacant eyes,  after a stone which had just whizzed by his ear. Everybody that came  along stopped for a few minutes to witness the sport, and Beacon Street  filled up with carriages till it looked as if some holiday procession  were halted in front of the State House. I left the crowd still at their  work, and must do them the justice to say that some of them were  excellent marksmen. An old negro, who stood near me, was bewailing the  law against shooting; else, he said, he would go home and get his gun.  He described, with appropriate gestures, how very easily he could fetch  the bird down. Perhaps he afterwards plucked up courage to violate the  statute. At any rate the next morning's newspapers reported that an owl  had been shot, the day before, on the Common. Poor bird of wisdom! His  sudden popularity proved to be the death of him. Like many of loftier  name he found it true,--        \"The path of glory leads but to the grave.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [1] My identification of _Turdus Aliciae_ was based entirely upon the  song, and so, of course, had no final scientific value. It was confirmed  a few weeks later, however, by Mr. William Brewster, who took specimens.  (See _Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club_, January, 1883, p.  12.) Prior to this the species was not known to breed in New England.    [2] _The Reign of Law_, p. 140.                                        BIRD-SONGS.        Canst thou imagine where those spirits live      Which make such delicate music in the woods?                                            SHELLEY.                                    BIRD-SONGS.      Why do birds sing? Has their music a meaning, or is it all a matter of  blind impulse? Some bright morning in March, as you go out-of-doors, you  are greeted by the notes of the first robin. Perched in a leafless tree,  there he sits, facing the sun like a genuine fire-worshiper, and singing  as though he would pour out his very soul. What is he thinking about?  What spirit possesses him?    It is easy to ask questions until the simplest matter comes to seem,  what at bottom it really is, a thing altogether mysterious; but if our  robin could understand us, he would, likely enough, reply:--    \"Why do you talk in this way, as if it were something requiring  explanation that a bird should sing? You seem to have forgotten that  everybody sings, or almost everybody. Think of the insects,--the bees  and the crickets and the locusts, to say nothing of your intimate  friends, the mosquitoes! Think, too, of the frogs and the hylas! If  these cold-blooded, low-lived creatures, after sleeping all winter in  the mud,[3] are free to make so much use of their voices, surely a bird  of the air may sing his unobtrusive song without being cross-examined  concerning the purpose of it. Why do the mice sing, and the monkeys, and  the woodchucks? Indeed, sir,--if one may be so bold,--why do you sing,  yourself?\"    This matter-of-fact Darwinism need not frighten us. It will do us no  harm to remember, now and then, \"the hole of the pit whence we were  digged;\" and besides, as far as any relationship between us and the  birds is concerned, it is doubtful whether we are the party to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#4)"],[1,"the majority  of women, as to their status as citizens of a republic, is not  remarkable, for history shows that the masses of all oppressed  classes, in the most degraded conditions, have been stolid and  apathetic until partial success had crowned the faith and enthusiasm  of the few.    The insurrections on Southern plantations were always defeated by the  doubt and duplicity of the slaves themselves. That little band of  heroes who precipitated the American Revolution in 1776 were so  ostracised that they walked the streets with bowed heads, from a sense  of loneliness and apprehension. Woman's apathy to the wrongs of her  sex, instead of being a plea for her remaining in her present  condition, is the strongest argument against it. How completely  demoralized by her subjection must she be, who does not feel her  personal dignity assailed when all women are ranked in every State  Constitution with idiots, lunatics, criminals, and minors; when in the  name of Justice, man holds one scale for woman, another for himself;  when by the spirit and letter of the laws she is made responsible for  crimes committed against her, while the male criminal goes free; when  from altars where she worships no woman may preach; when in the  courts, where girls of tender age may be arraigned for the crime of  infanticide, she may not plead for the most miserable of her sex; when  colleges she is taxed to build and endow, deny her the right to share  in their advantages; when she finds that which should be her  glory--her possible motherhood--treated everywhere by man as a  disability and a crime! A woman insensible to such indignities needs  some transformation into nobler thought, some purer atmosphere to  breathe, some higher stand-point from which to study human rights.    It is said, \"the difference between the sexes indicates different  spheres.\" It would be nearer the truth to say the difference indicates  different duties in the same sphere, seeing that man and woman were  evidently made for each other, and have shown equal capacity in the  ordinary range of human duties. In governing nations, leading armies,  piloting ships across the sea, rowing life-boats in terrific gales; in  art, science, invention, literature, woman has proved herself the  complement of man in the world of thought and action. This difference  does not compel us to spread our tables with different food for man  and woman, nor to provide in our common schools a different course of  study for boys and girls. Sex pervades all nature, yet the male and  female tree and vine and shrub rejoice in the same sunshine and shade.  The earth and air are free to all the fruits and flowers, yet each  absorbs what best ensures its growth. But whatever it is, it requires  no special watchfulness on our part to see that it is maintained. This  plea, when closely analyzed, is generally found to mean woman's  inferiority.    The superiority of man, however, does not enter into the demand for  suffrage, for in this country all men vote; and as the lower orders of  men are not superior, either by nature or grace, to the higher orders  of women, they must hold and exercise the right of self-government on  some other ground than superiority to women.    Again it is said, \"Woman when independent and self-asserting will lose  her influence over man.\" In the happiest conditions in life, men and  women will ever be mutually dependent on each other. The complete  development of all woman's powers will not make her less capable of  steadfast love and friendship, but give her new strength to meet the  emergencies of life, to aid those who look to her for counsel and  support. Men are uniformly more attentive to women of rank, family,  and fortune, who least need their care, than to any other class. We do  not see their protecting love generally extending to the helpless and  unfortunate ones of earth. Wherever the skilled hands and cultured  brain of woman have made the battle of life easier for man, he has  readily pardoned her sound judgment and proper self-assertion. But the  prejudices and preferences of man should be a secondary consideration,  in presence of the individual happiness and freedom of woman. The  formation of her character and its influence on the human race, is a  larger question than man's personal liking. There is no fear, however,  that when a superior order of women shall grace the earth, there will  not be an order of men to match them, and influence over such minds  will atone for the loss of it elsewhere.    An honest fear is sometimes expressed \"that woman would degrade  politics, and politics would degrade woman.\" As the influence of woman  has been uniformly elevating in new civilizations, in missionary work  in heathen nations, in schools, colleges, literature, and in general  society, it is fair to suppose that politics would prove no exception.  On the other hand, as the art of government is the most exalted of all  sciences, and statesmanship requires the highest order of mind, the  ennobling and refining influence of such pursuits must elevate rather  than degrade woman. When politics degenerate into bitter persecutions  and vulgar court-gossip, they are degrading to man, and his honor,  virtue, dignity, and refinement are as valuable to woman as her  virtues, are to him.    Again, it is said, \"Those who make laws must execute them; government  needs force behind it,--a woman could not be sheriff or a policeman.\"  She might not fill these offices in the way men do, but she might far  more effectively guard the morals of society, and the sanitary  conditions of our cities. It might with equal force be said that a  woman of culture and artistic taste can not keep house, because she  can not wash and iron with her own hands, and clean the range and  furnace. At the head of the police, a woman could direct her forces  and keep order without ever using a baton or a pistol in her own  hands. \"The elements of sovereignty,\" says Blackstone, \"are three:  wisdom, goodness, and power.\" Conceding to woman wisdom and goodness,  as they are not strictly masculine virtues, and substituting moral  power for physical force, we have the necessary elements of government  for most of life's emergencies. Women manage families, mixed schools,  charitable institutions, large boarding-houses and hotels, farms and  steam-engines, drunken and disorderly men and women, and stop street  fights, as well as men do. The queens in history compare favorably  with the kings.    But, \"in the settlement of national difficulties,\" it is said, \"the  last resort is war; shall we summon our wives and mothers to the  battle-field?\" Women have led armies in all ages, have held positions  in the army and navy for years in disguise. Some fought, bled, and  died on the battle-field in our late war. They performed severe labors  in the hospitals and sanitary department. Wisdom would dictate a  division of labor in war as well as in peace, assigning each their  appropriate department.    Numerous classes of men who enjoy their political rights are exempt  from military duty. All men over forty-five, all who suffer mental or  physical disability, such as the loss of an eye or a forefinger;  clergymen, physicians, Quakers, school-teachers, professors, and  presidents of colleges, judges, legislators, congressmen, State prison  officials, and all county, State and National officers; fathers,  brothers, or sons having certain relatives dependent on them for  support,--all of these summed up in every State in the Union make  millions of voters thus exempted.    In view of this fact there is no force in the plea, that \"if women  vote they must fight.\" Moreover, war is not the normal state of the  human family in its higher development, but merely a feature of  barbarism lasting on through the transition of the race, from the  savage to the scholar. When England and America settled the Alabama  Claims by the Geneva Arbitration, they pointed the way for the future  adjustment of all national difficulties.    Some fear, \"If women assume all the duties political equality implies,  that the time and attention necessary to the duties of home life will  be absorbed in the affairs of State.\" The act of voting occupies but  little time in itself, and the vast majority of women will attend to  their family and social affairs to the neglect of the State, just as  men do to their individual interests. The virtue of patriotism is  subordinate in most souls to individual and family aggrandizement. As  to offices, it is not to be supposed that the class of men now  elected will resign to women their chances, and if they should to any  extent, the necessary number of women to fill the offices would make  no apparent change in our social circles. If, for example, the Senate  of the United States should be entirely composed of women, but two in  each State would be withdrawn from the pursuit of domestic happiness.  For many reasons, under all circumstances, a comparatively smaller  proportion of women than men would actively engage in politics.    As the power to extend or limit the suffrage rests now wholly in the  hands of man, he can commence the experiment with as small a number as  he sees fit, by requiring any lawful qualification. Men were admitted  on property and educational qualifications in most of the States, at  one time, and still are in some--so hard has it been for man to  understand the theory of self-government. Three-fourths of the women  would be thus disqualified, and the remaining fourth would be too  small a minority to precipitate a social revolution or defeat  masculine measures in the halls of legislation, even if women were a  unit on all questions and invariably voted together, which they would  not. In this view, the path of duty is plain for the prompt action of  those gentlemen who fear universal suffrage for women, but are willing  to grant it on property and educational"]]]
