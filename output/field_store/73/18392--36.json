The girls laughed until  they cried over it and voted it to be the best thing Nellie had yet  done in original work.    All this had taken time and it was past eleven o'clock. Miss Allen had  cried herself to sleep long ago and everybody else in Chestnut Terrace  was abed when five figures cautiously crept down the hall, headed by  Jean with a dim lamp. Outside of Miss Allen's door the procession  halted and the girls silently arranged their gifts on the floor.    \"That's done,\" whispered Jean in a tone of satisfaction as they  tiptoed back. \"And now let us go to bed or Mrs. Pickrell, bless her  heart, will be down on us for burning so much midnight oil. Oil has  gone up, you know, girls.\"    It was in the early morning that Miss Allen opened her door. But early  as it was, another door down the hall was half open too and five rosy  faces were peering cautiously out. The girls had been up for an hour  for fear they would miss the sight and were all in Nellie's room,  which commanded a view of Miss Allen's door.    That lady's face was a study. Amazement, incredulity, wonder, chased  each other over it, succeeded by a glow of pleasure. On the floor  before her was a snug little pyramid of parcels topped by Jean's  letter. On a chair behind it was a bowl of delicious hot-house roses  and Nellie's placard.    Miss Allen looked down the hall but saw nothing, for Jean had slammed  the door just in time. Half an hour later when they were going down to  breakfast Miss Allen came along the hall with outstretched hands to  meet them. She had been crying again, but I think her tears were happy  ones; and she was smiling now. A cluster of Jean's roses were pinned  on her breast.    \"Oh, girls, girls,\" she said, with a little tremble in her voice, \"I  can never thank you enough. It was so kind and sweet of you. You don't  know how much good you have done me.\"    Breakfast was an unusually cheerful affair at No. 16 that morning.  There was no skeleton at the feast and everybody was beaming. Miss  Allen laughed and talked like a girl herself.    \"Oh, how surprised I was!\" she said. \"The roses were like a bit of  summer, and those cats of Nellie's were so funny and delightful. And  your letter too, Jean! I cried and laughed over it. I shall read it  every day for a year.\"    After breakfast everyone went to Christmas service. The girls went  uptown to the church they attended. The city was very beautiful in the  morning sunshine. There had been a white frost in the night and the  tree-lined avenues and public squares seemed like glimpses of  fairyland.    \"How lovely the world is,\" said Jean.    \"This is really the very happiest Christmas morning I have ever  known,\" declared Nellie. \"I never felt so really Christmassy in my  inmost soul before.\"    \"I suppose,\" said Beth thoughtfully, \"that it is because we have  discovered for ourselves the old truth that it is more blessed to give  than to receive. I've always known it, in a way, but I never realized  it before.\"    \"Blessing on Jean's Christmas inspiration,\" said Nellie. \"But, girls,  let us try to make it an all-the-year-round inspiration, I say. We can  bring a little of our own sunshine into Miss Allen's life as long as  we live with her.\"    \"Amen to that!\" said Jean heartily. \"Oh, listen, girls--the Christmas  chimes!\"    And over all the beautiful city was wafted the grand old message of  peace on earth and good will to all the world.          A Christmas Mistake      \"Tomorrow is Christmas,\" announced Teddy Grant exultantly, as he sat  on the floor struggling manfully with a refractory bootlace that was  knotted and tagless and stubbornly refused to go into the eyelets of  Teddy's patched boots. \"Ain't I glad, though. Hurrah!\"    His mother was washing the breakfast dishes in a dreary, listless sort  of way. She looked tired and broken-spirited. Ted's enthusiasm seemed  to grate on her, for she answered sharply:    \"Christmas, indeed. I can't see that it is anything for us to rejoice  over. Other people may be glad enough, but what with winter coming on  I'd sooner it was spring than Christmas. Mary Alice, do lift that  child out of the ashes and put its shoes and stockings on. Everything  seems to be at sixes and sevens here this morning.\"    Keith, the oldest boy, was coiled up on the sofa calmly working out  some algebra problems, quite oblivious to the noise around him. But he  looked up from his slate, with his pencil suspended above an obstinate  equation, to declaim with a flourish:        \"Christmas comes but once a year,      And then Mother wishes it wasn't here.\"    \"I don't, then,\" said Gordon, son number two, who was preparing his  own noon lunch of bread and molasses at the table, and making an  atrocious mess of crumbs and sugary syrup over everything. \"I know one  thing to be thankful for, and that is that there'll be no school.  We'll have a whole week of holidays.\"    Gordon was noted for his aversion to school and his affection for  holidays.    \"And we're going to have turkey for dinner,\" declared Teddy, getting  up off the floor and rushing to secure his share of bread and  molasses, \"and cranb'ry sauce and--and--pound cake! Ain't we, Ma?\"    \"No, you are not,\" said Mrs. Grant desperately, dropping the dishcloth  and snatching the baby on her knee to wipe the crust of cinders and  molasses from the chubby pink-and-white face. \"You may as well know it  now, children, I've kept it from you so far in hopes that something  would turn up, but nothing has. We can't have any Christmas dinner  tomorrow--we can't afford it. I've pinched and saved every way I could  for the last month, hoping that I'd be able to get a turkey for you  anyhow, but you'll have to do without it. There's that doctor's bill  to pay and a dozen other bills coming in--and people say they can't  wait. I suppose they can't, but it's kind of hard, I must say.\"    The little Grants stood with open mouths and horrified eyes. No turkey  for Christmas! Was the world coming to an end? Wouldn't the government  interfere if anyone ventured to dispense with a Christmas celebration?    The gluttonous Teddy stuffed his fists into his eyes and lifted up his  voice. Keith, who understood better than the others the look on his  mother's face, took his blubbering young brother by the collar and  marched him into the porch. The twins, seeing the summary proceeding,  swallowed the outcries they had intended to make, although they  couldn't keep a few big tears from running down their fat cheeks.    Mrs. Grant looked pityingly at the disappointed faces about her.    \"Don't cry, children, you make me feel worse. We are not the only ones  who will have to do without a Christmas turkey. We ought to be very  thankful that we have anything to eat at all. I hate to disappoint  you, but it can't be helped.\"    \"Never mind, Mother,\" said Keith, comfortingly, relaxing his hold  upon the porch door, whereupon it suddenly flew open and precipitated  Teddy, who had been tugging at the handle, heels over head backwards.  \"We know you've done your best. It's been a hard year for you. Just  wait, though. I'll soon be grown up, and then you and these greedy  youngsters shall feast on turkey every day of the year. Hello, Teddy,  have you got on your feet again? Mind, sir, no more blubbering!\"    \"When I'm a man,\" announced Teddy with dignity, \"I'd just like to see  you put me in the porch. And I mean to have turkey all the time and I  won't give you any, either.\"    \"All right, you greedy small boy. Only take yourself off to school  now, and let us hear no more squeaks out of you. Tramp, all of you,  and give Mother a chance to get her work done.\"    Mrs. Grant got up and fell to work at her dishes with a brighter face.    \"Well, we mustn't give in; perhaps things will be better after a  while. I'll make a famous bread pudding, and you can boil some  molasses taffy and ask those little Smithsons next door to help you  pull it. They won't whine for turkey, I'll be bound. I don't suppose  they ever tasted such a thing in all their lives. If I could afford  it, I'd have had them all in to dinner with us. That sermon Mr. Evans  preached last Sunday kind of stirred me up. He said we ought always  to try and share our Christmas joy with some poor souls who had never  learned the meaning of the word. I can't do as much as I'd like to. It  was different when your father was alive.\"    The noisy group grew silent as they always did when their father was  spoken of. He had died the year before, and since his death the little  family had had a hard time. Keith, to hide his feelings, began to  hector the rest.    \"Mary Alice, do hurry up. Here, you twin nuisances, get off to school.  If you don't you'll be late and then the master will give you a  whipping.\"    \"He won't,\" answered the irrepressible Teddy. \"He never whips us, he  doesn't. He stands us on the floor sometimes, though,\" he added,  remembering the many times his own chubby legs had been seen to better  advantage on the school platform.    \"That man,\" said Mrs. Grant, alluding to the teacher, \"makes me  nervous. He is the most abstracted creature I ever saw in my life. It  is a wonder to me he doesn't walk straight into the river some day.  You'll meet him meandering along the street, gazing into vacancy, and  he'll never see you nor hear a word you say half the time.\"    \"Yesterday,\" said Gordon, chuckling over the remembrance, \"he came in  with a big piece of paper he'd picked up on the entry floor in one  hand and his hat in the other--and he stuffed his hat into the  coal-sc"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#4)"],[1,"eady-made wedding and decorations and assembled guests, a minister on  the spot and a state where no licence is required. You have a very  pretty new dress on and you love me. I have a plain gold ring on my  little finger that will fit you. Aren't all the conditions fulfilled?  Where is the sense of waiting and having another family upheaval in a  few weeks' time?\"    \"I understand why you have made such a success of the law,\" said Esme,  \"but--\"    \"There are no buts. Come with me, Esme. I'm going to hunt up your  mother and mine and talk to them.\"    Half an hour later an astonishing whisper went circulating among the  guests. Before they could grasp its significance Tom St. Clair and  Jen's husband, broadly smiling, were hustling scattered folk into the  parlour again and making clear a passage in the hall. The minister  came in with his blue book, and then Selwyn Grant and Esme Graham  walked in hand in hand.    When the second ceremony was over, Mr. Grant shook his son's hand  vigorously. \"There's no need to wish you happiness, son; you've got  it. And you've made one fuss and bother do for both weddings, that's  what I call genius. And\"--this in a careful whisper, while Esme was  temporarily obliterated in Mrs. Grant's capacious embrace--\"she's got  the right sort of a nose. But your mother is a grand woman, son, a  grand woman.\"          At the Bay Shore Farm      The Newburys were agog with excitement over the Governor's picnic. As  they talked it over on the verandah at sunset, they felt that life  could not be worth living to those unfortunate people who had not been  invited to it. Not that there were many of the latter in Claymont, for  it was the Governor's native village, and the Claymonters were getting  up the picnic for him during his political visit to the city fifteen  miles away.    Each of the Newburys had a special reason for wishing to attend the  Governor's picnic. Ralph and Elliott wanted to see the Governor  himself. He was a pet hero of theirs. Had he not once been a Claymont  lad just like themselves? Had he not risen to the highest office in  the state by dint of sheer hard work and persistency? Had he not won a  national reputation by his prompt and decisive measures during the big  strike at Campden? And was he not a man, personally and politically,  whom any boy might be proud to imitate? Yes, to all of these  questions. Hence to the Newbury boys the interest of the picnic  centred in the Governor.    \"I shall feel two inches taller just to get a look at him,\" said Ralph  enthusiastically.    \"He isn't much to look at,\" said Frances, rather patronizingly. \"I saw  him once at Campden--he came to the school when his daughter was  graduated. He is bald and fat. Oh, of course, he is famous and all  that! But I want to go to the picnic to see Sara Beaumont. She's to be  there with the Chandlers from Campden, and Mary Spearman, who knows  her by sight, is going to point her out to me. I suppose it would be  too much to expect to be introduced to her. I shall probably have to  content myself with just looking at her.\"    Ralph resented hearing the Governor called bald and fat. Somehow it  seemed as if his hero were being reduced to the level of common clay.    \"That's like a girl,\" he said loftily; \"thinking more about a woman  who writes books than about a man like the Governor!\"    \"I'd rather see Sara Beaumont than forty governors,\" retorted Frances.  \"Why, she's famous--and her books are perfect! If I could ever hope to  write anything like them! It's been the dream of my life just to see  her ever since I read _The Story of Idlewild_. And now to think that  it is to be fulfilled! It seems too good to be true that  tomorrow--tomorrow, Newburys,--I shall see Sara Beaumont!\"    \"Well,\" said Cecilia gently--Cecilia was always gentle even in her  enthusiasm--\"I shall like to see the Governor and Sara Beaumont too.  But I'm going to the picnic more for the sake of seeing Nan Harris  than anything else. It's three years since she went away, you know,  and I've never had another chum whom I love so dearly. I'm just  looking forward to meeting her and talking over all our dear, good old  times. I do wonder if she has changed much. But I am sure I shall know  her.\"    \"By her red hair and her freckles?\" questioned Elliott teasingly.  \"They'll be the same as ever, I'll be bound.\"    Cecilia flushed and looked as angry as she could--which isn't saying  much, after all. She didn't mind when Elliott teased her about her pug  nose and her big mouth, but it always hurt her when he made fun of  Nan.    Nan's family had once lived across the street from the Newburys. Nan  and Cecilia had been playmates all through childhood, but when both  girls were fourteen the Harrises had moved out west. Cecilia had never  seen Nan since. But now the latter had come east for a visit, and was  with her relatives in Campden. She was to be at the picnic, and  Cecilia's cup of delight brimmed over.    Mrs. Newbury came briskly into the middle of their sunset plans. She  had been down to the post office, and she carried an open letter in  her hand.    \"Mother,\" said Frances, straightening up anxiously, \"you have a  pitying expression on your face. Which of us is it for--speak  out--don't keep us in suspense. Has Mary Spearman told you that Sara  Beaumont isn't going to be at the picnic?\"    \"Or that the Governor isn't going to be there?\"    \"Or that Nan Harris isn't coming?\"    \"Or that something's happened to put off the affair altogether?\" cried  Ralph and Cecilia and Elliott all at once.    Mrs. Newbury laughed. \"No, it's none of those things. And I don't know  just whom I do pity, but it is one of you girls. This is a letter from  Grandmother Newbury. Tomorrow is her birthday, and she wants either  Frances or Cecilia to go out to Ashland on the early morning train and  spend the day at the Bay Shore Farm.\"    There was silence on the verandah of the Newburys for the space of ten  seconds. Then Frances burst out with: \"Mother, you know neither of us  can go tomorrow. If it were any other day! But the day of the picnic!\"    \"I'm sorry, but one of you must go,\" said Mrs. Newbury firmly. \"Your  father said so when I called at the store to show him the letter.  Grandmother Newbury would be very much hurt and displeased if her  invitation were disregarded--you know that. But we leave it to  yourselves to decide which one shall go.\"    \"Don't do that,\" implored Frances miserably. \"Pick one of us  yourself--pull straws--anything to shorten the agony.\"    \"No; you must settle it for yourselves,\" said Mrs. Newbury. But in  spite of herself she looked at Cecilia. Cecilia was apt to be looked  at, someway, when things were to be given up. Mostly it was Cecilia  who gave them up. The family had come to expect it of her; they all  said that Cecilia was very unselfish.    Cecilia knew that her mother looked at her, but did not turn her face.  She couldn't, just then; she looked away out over the hills and tried  to swallow something that came up in her throat.    \"Glad I'm not a girl,\" said Ralph, when Mrs. Newbury had gone into the  house. \"Whew! Nothing could induce me to give up that picnic--not if a  dozen Grandmother Newburys were offended. Where's your sparkle gone  now, Fran?\"    \"It's too bad of Grandmother Newbury,\" declared Frances angrily.    \"Oh, Fran, she didn't know about the picnic,\" said Cecilia--but still  without turning round.    \"Well, she needn't always be so annoyed if we don't go when we are  invited. Another day would do just as well,\" said Frances shortly.  Something in her voice sounded choked too. She rose and walked to the  other end of the verandah, where she stood and scowled down the road;  Ralph and Elliott, feeling uncomfortable, went away.    The verandah was very still for a little while. The sun had quite set,  and it was growing dark when Frances came back to the steps.    \"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" she said shortly. \"Which of  us is to go to the Bay Shore?\"    \"I suppose I had better go,\" said Cecilia slowly--very slowly indeed.    Frances kicked her slippered toe against the fern _jardiniere_.    \"You may see Nan Harris somewhere else before she goes back,\" she said  consolingly.    \"Yes, I may,\" said Cecilia. She knew quite well that she would not.  Nan would return to Campden on the special train, and she was going  back west in three days.    It was hard to give the picnic up, but Cecilia was used to giving  things up. Nobody ever expected Frances to give things up; she was so  brilliant and popular that the good things of life came her way  naturally. It never seemed to matter so much about quiet Cecilia.           *       *       *       *       *    Cecilia cried herself to sleep that night. She felt that it was  horribly selfish of her to do so, but she couldn't help it. She awoke  in the morning with a confused idea that it was very late. Why hadn't  Mary called her, as she had been told to do?    Through the open door between her room and Frances's she could see  that the latter's bed was empty. Then she saw a little note, addressed  to her, pinned on the pillow.        Dear Saint Cecilia [it ran], when you read this I shall be on      the train to Ashland to spend the day with Grandmother      Newbury. You've been giving up things so often and so long      that I suppose you think you have a monopoly of it; but you      see you haven't. I didn't tell you this last night because I      hadn't quite made up my mind. But after you went upstairs, I      fought it out to a finish and came to a decision. Sara      Beaumont would keep, but Nan Harris wouldn't, so you must go      to the picnic. I told Mary to call me instead of you this      morning, and now I'm off. You needn't spoil your fun pitying      me. Now that the wrench is over, I feel a most delightful glow      of virtuous satisfaction!                                                 Fran.
