[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#4)"],[1," The city had entirely  vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist  had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow  upon the ground.    \"Good Spirit!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked  about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!\"    The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been  light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense  of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odors floating in the air,  each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and  cares long, long, forgotten!    \"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is that upon your  cheek?\"    Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a  pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.    \"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.    \"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervor; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"    \"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed the Ghost.  \"Let us go on.\"    They walked along the road, Scrooge recognizing every gate, and post,  and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its  bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen  trotting toward them with boys upon their backs, who called to other  boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were  in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were  so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.    \"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost.  \"They have no consciousness of us.\"    The jocund travelers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named  them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why  did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why  was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry  Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several  homes? What was Merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon Merry Christmas!  What good had it ever done to him?    \"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A solitary child,  neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"    Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.    They left the high-road, by a well remembered lane, and soon approached  a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted  cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but  one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their  walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates  decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses  and sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its  ancient state within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through  the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold,  and vast. There was an earthy savor in the air, a chilly bareness in the  place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by  candle-light, and not too much to eat.    They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back  of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,  melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and  desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and  Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as  he had used to be.    \"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking  about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: \"but it's too late now.\"    \"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.    \"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas  Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:  that's all.\"    The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so,  \"Let us see another Christmas!\"    Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a  little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;  fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were  shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more  than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct: that everything had  happened so: that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had  gone home for the jolly holidays.    He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge  looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced  anxiously toward the door.    It opened; and a little girl much younger than the boy, came darting in,  and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed  him as her \"Dear, dear brother.\"    \"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the child, clapping  her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. \"To bring you home, home,  home!\"    \"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.    \"Yes,\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home, for good and all. Home,  for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that  home's like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was  going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might  come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring  you. And you're to be a man!\" said the child, opening her eyes; \"and are  never to come back here: but first, we're to be together all the  Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.\"    \"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.    She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but  being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.  Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, toward the door;  and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.    A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge's box,  there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on  Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a  dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. Master Scrooge's trunk  being tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the  schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily  down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow  from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.    \"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,\" said  the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"    \"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You're right. I will not gainsay it  Spirit. God forbid!\"    \"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\"    \"One child,\" Scrooge returned.    \"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"    Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, \"Yes.\"    Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were  now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed  and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and  all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain  enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas  time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.    The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he  knew it.    \"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was not I apprenticed here!\"    They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting  behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must  have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great  excitement:    \"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig alive again!\"    Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which  pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his  capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his  organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,  jovial voice:    \"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"    Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,  accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.    \"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost. \"Bless me, yes.  There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,  dear!\"    \"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig, \"No more work to-night. Christmas Eve,  Dick, Christmas, Ebenezer. Let's have the shutters up,\" cried old  Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack  Robinson!\"    You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into  the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their  places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight,  nine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like  race-horses.    \"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with  wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room  here!\"    Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or  couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in  a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from  public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps  were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as  snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a play-room as you would desire to  see upon a winter's night.    In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and  made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came  Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss  Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came all the young men and women  employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the  baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend, the  milkman. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,  some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all  came, anyhow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#4)"],[1,"  a constant rate, is carefully weighed. The temperatures of the water  entering and leaving the chamber are accurately recorded at frequent  intervals. The walls of the chamber are held adiabatic, thus preventing  a gain or loss of heat by arbitrarily heating or cooling the outer metal  walls, and the withdrawal of heat by the water-current is so controlled,  by varying the temperature of the ingoing water, that the heat brought  away from the calorimeter is exactly equal in amount to the heat  eliminated by radiation and conduction by the subject, thus maintaining  a constant temperature inside of the chamber. The latent heat of the  water vaporized is determined by measuring directly the water vapor in  the ventilating air-current.    In the construction of the new calorimeters a further and fundamental  change in construction has been made in that all the thermal junctions,  heating wires, and cooling pipes have been attached directly to the zinc  wall of the calorimeter, leaving the outer insulating panels free from  incumbrances, so that they can be removed readily and practically all  parts inspected whenever desired without necessitating complete  dismantling of the apparatus. This arrangement is possible except in  those instances where connections pass clear through from the interior  of the chamber to the outside, namely, the food-aperture, air-pipes,  water-pipes, electrical connections, and tubes for connections with  pneumograph and stethoscope; but the apparatus is so arranged as to have  all of these openings in one part of the calorimeter. It is possible,  therefore, to remove all of the outer sections of the calorimeter with  the exception of panels on the east side.    This fundamental change in construction has proven highly advantageous.  It does away with the necessity of rolling the calorimeter out of its  protecting insulating house and minimizes the delay and expense  incidental to repairs or modifications. As the calorimeter is now  constructed, it is possible to get at all parts of it from the outside,  with the exception of one small fixed panel through which the above  connections are passed. This panel, however, is made as narrow as  possible, so that practically all changes can be made by taking out the  adjacent panels.      THE CALORIMETER CHAMBER.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Horizontal cross-section of chair calorimeter,  showing cross-section of copper wall at A, zinc wall at B, hair-felt at  E, and asbestos outer wall at F; also cross-section of all upright  channels in the steel construction. At the right is the location of the  ingoing and outgoing water and the thermometers. At C is shown the food  aperture, and D is a gasket separating the two parts. The ingoing and  outcoming air-pipes are shown at the right inside the copper wall. The  telephone is shown at the left, and in the center of the drawing is the  chair with its foot-rest, G. In dotted line is shown the opening where  the man enters.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Vertical cross-section of chair calorimeter,  showing part of rear of calorimeter and structural-steel frame.

As a result, it was found at the end of a number of years  of experimenting that this particular size of chamber was somewhat too  small for the most satisfactory experiments during muscular work and, on  the other hand, somewhat too large for the best results during so-called  rest experiments. In the earlier experiments, where no attempt was made  to determine the consumption of oxygen, these disadvantages were not so  apparent, as carbon dioxide could be determined with very great  accuracy; but with the attempts to measure the oxygen it was found that  the large volume of residual air inside the chamber, amounting to some  4,500 liters, made possible very considerable errors in this  determination, for, obviously, the subject could draw upon the oxygen  residual in the air of the chamber, nearly 1,000 liters, as well as upon  the oxygen furnished from outside sources. The result was that a very  careful analysis of the residual air must be made frequently in order to  insure that the increase or decrease in the amount of oxygen residual in  the air of the chamber was known accurately at the end of each period.  Analysis of this large volume of air could be made with considerable  accuracy, but in order to calculate the exact total of oxygen residual  in the air it was necessary to know the total volume of air inside the  chamber under standard conditions. This necessitated, therefore, a  careful measurement of temperature and pressure, and while the  barometric pressure could be measured with a high degree of accuracy,  it was found to be very difficult to determine exactly the average  temperature of so large a mass of air. The difficulties attending this  measurement and experiments upon this point are discussed in detail  elsewhere.[5] Consequently, as a result of this experience, in planning  the calorimeters for the Nutrition Laboratory it was decided to design  them for special types of experiments. The first calorimeter to be  constructed was one which would have general use in experiments during  rest and, indeed, during experiments with the subject sitting quietly in  the chair.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Vertical cross-section of chair calorimeter from  front to back, showing structural steel supporting the calorimeter and  the large balance above for weighing the subject inside the calorimeter.  The chair, method of suspension, and apparatus for raising and lowering  are shown. Part of the heat-absorbers is shown, and their general  direction. The ingoing and outgoing air-pipes and direction of  ventilation are also indicated. The positions of the food-aperture and  wire mat and asbestos support are seen. Surrounding the calorimeter are  the asbestos outside and hair-felt lining.]    It may well be asked why the first calorimeter was not constructed of  such a type as to permit the subject assuming a position on a couch or  sofa, such as is used by Zuntz and his collaborators in their research  on the respiratory exchange, or the position of complete muscular rest  introduced by Johansson and his associates. While the body positions  maintained by Zuntz and Johansson may be the best positions for  experiments of short duration, it was found, as a result of a large  number of experiments, that subjects could be more comfortable and quiet  for periods of from 6 to 8 hours by sitting, somewhat inclined, in a  comfortable arm-chair, provided with a foot-rest. With this in mind the  first calorimeter was constructed so as to hold an arm-chair with a  foot-rest so adjusted that the air-space between the body of the subject  and the walls of the chamber could be cut down to the minimum and thus  increase the accuracy of the determination of oxygen. That the volume  has been very materially reduced may be seen from the fact that the  total volume of the first calorimeter to be described is less than 1,400  liters, or about one-third that of the Middletown apparatus.      GENERAL CONSTRUCTION.    A horizontal cross-section of the apparatus is shown in fig. 7, and a  vertical cross-section facing the front is given in fig. 8. Other  details of structural steel are seen in fig. 9.    In constructing the new chambers, the earlier wood construction, with  its tendency to warp and its general non-rigidity, was avoided by the  use of structural steel, and hence in this calorimeter no use whatever  is made of wood other than the wood of the chair.    To avoid temperature fluctuations due to possible local stratification  of the air in the laboratory, the calorimeter is constructed so as to be  practically suspended in the air, there being a large air-space of some  76 centimeters between the lowest point of the calorimeter and the  floor, and the top of the calorimeter is some 212 centimeters below the  ceiling of the room. Four upright structural-steel channels (4-inch)  were bolted through the floor, so as to secure great rigidity, and were  tied together at the top with structural steel. As a solid base for the  calorimeter chamber two 3-inch channels were placed parallel to each  other 70 centimeters from the floor, joined to these uprights. Upon  these two 3-inch channels the calorimeter proper was constructed. The  steel used for the most part in the skeleton of the apparatus is  standard 2-1/2-inch channel. This steel frame and its support are shown  in fig. 10, before any of the copper lining was put into position. The  main 4-inch channels upon which the calorimeter is supported, the  tie-rods and turn-buckles anchoring the framework to the ceiling, the  I-beam construction at the top upon which is subsequently installed the  large balance for weighing the man, the series of small channels set on  edge upon which the asbestos floor is laid, and the upright row of  channel ribs are all clearly shown.    [Illustration: FIG. 10    Photograph of framework of chair calorimeter. In the photograph are  shown four upright channels and the channels at the top for supporting  the calorimeter. The smaller upright 2-1/2 inch channels and angles are  shown inside of this frame. In the lower part of the figure is seen the  asbestos board for the bottom of the calorimeter and underneath this a  sheet of zinc.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11    Photograph of portion of framework and copper shell.
