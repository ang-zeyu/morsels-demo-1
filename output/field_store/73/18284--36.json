After turning his composed  eyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to Zeb,  who was a little taller than Dorothy:    \"Tell me, intruder, was it you who caused the Rain of Stones?\"    For a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question. Then,  remembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them long  before they had reached this place, he answered:    \"No, sir; we didn't cause anything. It was the earthquake.\"    The man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over this  speech. Then he asked:    \"What is an earthquake?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Zeb, who was still confused. But Dorothy, seeing  his perplexity, answered:    \"It's a shaking of the earth. In this quake a big crack opened and we  fell through--horse and buggy, and all--and the stones got loose and  came down with us.\"    The man with the star regarded her with his calm, expressionless eyes.    \"The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city,\" he said; \"and we  shall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence.\"    \"How can we do that?\" asked the girl.    \"That I am not prepared to say. It is your affair, not mine. You must  go to the House of the Sorcerer, who will soon discover the truth.\"    \"Where is the House of the Sorcerer?\" the girl enquired.    \"I will lead you to it. Come!\"    He turned and walked down the street, and after a moment's hesitation  Dorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy. The boy  took his seat beside her and said: \"Gid-dap, Jim.\"    As the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glass  city made way for them and formed a procession in their rear. Slowly  they moved down one street and up another, turning first this way and  then that, until they came to an open square in the center of which was  a big glass palace having a central dome and four tall spires on each  corner.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 3.    THE ARRIVAL OF THE WIZARD      The doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse and  buggy to enter, so Zeb drove straight through it and the children found  themselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful. The people at once  followed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room,  leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the  center of the hall.    \"Come to us, oh, Gwig!\" called the man, in a loud voice.    Instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then it  slowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange personage  seated upon a glass throne just before Jim's nose. He was formed just as  were the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing only differed  from theirs in being bright yellow. But he had no hair at all, and all  over his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharp  thorns like those found on the branches of rose-bushes. There was even a  thorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that Dorothy  laughed when she saw him.    The Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl with  cold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant.    \"Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded  Land of the Mangaboos?\" he asked, sternly.    \"'Cause we couldn't help it,\" said Dorothy.    \"Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack and  break our houses?\" he continued.    \"We didn't,\" declared the girl.    \"Prove it!\" cried the Sorcerer.    \"We don't have to prove it,\" answered Dorothy, indignantly. \"If you had  any sense at all you'd known it was the earthquake.\"    \"We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us, which did  much damage and injured some of our people. Today came another Rain of  Stones, and soon after it you appeared among us.\"    \"By the way,\" said the man with the star, looking steadily at the  Sorcerer, \"you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rain  of Stones. Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first.  What is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth?\"    \"My sorcery does tell the truth!\" declared the thorn-covered man. \"I  said there would be but one Rain of Stones. This second one was a Rain  of People-and-Horse-and-Buggy. And some stones came with them.\"    \"Will there be any more Rains?\" asked the man with the star.    \"No, my Prince.\"    \"Neither stones nor people?\"    \"No, my Prince.\"    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Quite sure, my Prince. My sorcery tells me so.\"    Just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Prince  after making a low bow.    \"More wonders in the air, my Lord,\" said he.    Immediately the Prince and all of his people flocked out of the hall  into the street, that they might see what was about to happen. Dorothy  and Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcerer  remained calmly in his throne.    Far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon. It was not  so high as the glowing star of the six colored suns, but was descending  slowly through the air--so slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to  move.    The throng stood still and waited. It was all they could do, for to go  away and leave that strange sight was impossible; nor could they hurry  its fall in any way. The earth children were not noticed, being so near  the average size of the Mangaboos, and the horse had remained in the  House of the Sorcerer, with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of the  buggy.    Gradually the balloon grew bigger, which was proof that it was settling  down upon the Land of the Mangaboos. Dorothy was surprised to find how  patient the people were, for her own little heart was beating rapidly  with excitement. A balloon meant to her some other arrival from the  surface of the earth, and she hoped it would be some one able to assist  her and Zeb out of their difficulties.    In an hour the balloon had come near enough for her to see a basket  suspended below it; in two hours she could see a head looking over the  side of the basket; in three hours the big balloon settled slowly into  the great square in which they stood and came to rest on the glass  pavement.    Then a little man jumped out of the basket, took off his tall hat, and  bowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him. He was quite  an old little man, and his head was long and entirely bald.    \"Why,\" cried Dorothy, in amazement, \"it's Oz!\"    The little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she  was. But he smiled and bowed as he answered:    \"Yes, my dear; I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Eh? And you are little  Dorothy, from Kansas. I remember you very well.\"    \"Who did you say it was?\" whispered Zeb to the girl.    \"It's the wonderful Wizard of Oz. Haven't you heard of him?\"    Just then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard.    \"Sir,\" said he, \"why are you here, in the Land of the Mangaboos?\"    \"Didn't know what land it was, my son,\" returned the other, with a  pleasant smile; \"and, to be honest, I didn't mean to visit you when I  started out. I live on top of the earth, your honor, which is far better  than living inside it; but yesterday I went up in a balloon, and when I  came down I fell into a big crack in the earth, caused by an earthquake.  I had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not rise again,  and in a few minutes the earth closed over my head. So I continued to  descend until I reached this place, and if you will show me a way to get  out of it, I'll go with pleasure. Sorry to have troubled you; but it  couldn't be helped.\"    The Prince had listened with attention. Said he:    \"This child, who is from the crust of the earth, like yourself, called  you a Wizard. Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer?\"    \"It's better,\" replied Oz, promptly. \"One Wizard is worth three  Sorcerers.\"    \"Ah, you shall prove that,\" said the Prince. \"We Mangaboos have, at the  present time, one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was picked  from a bush; but he sometimes makes mistakes. Do you ever make  mistakes?\"    \"Never!\" declared the Wizard, boldly.    \"Oh, Oz!\" said Dorothy; \"you made a lot of mistakes when you were in the  marvelous Land of Oz.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the little man, turning red--although just then a ray  of violet sunlight was on his round face.    \"Come with me,\" said the Prince to him. \"I wish you to meet our  Sorcerer.\"    The Wizard did not like this invitation, but he could not refuse to  accept it. So he followed the Prince into the great domed hall, and  Dorothy and Zeb came after them, while the throng of people trooped in  also.    There sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state, and when the Wizard  saw him he began to laugh, uttering comical little chuckles.    \"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed.    \"He may look absurd,\" said the Prince, in his quiet voice; \"but he is an  excellent Sorcerer. The only fault I find with him is that he is so  often wrong.\"    \"I am never wrong,\" answered the Sorcerer.    \"Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of Stones  or of People,\" said the Prince.    \"Well, what then?\"    \"Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong.\"    \"One person cannot be called 'people,'\" said the Sorcerer. \"If two  should come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong; but  unless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right.\"    \"Very clever,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head as if pleased. \"I am  delighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top of  it. Were you ever with a circus, brother?\"    \"No,\" said the Sorcerer.    \"You ought to join one,\" declared the little man seriously. \"I belong to  Bailum & Barney's Great Consolidated Shows--three rings in one tent and  a menagerie on the side. It's a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22567"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 2 (#4)"],[1," that a stamp act for the colonies  had been proposed in Parliament, to raise revenue by forcing the use in  America of stamped forms for all sorts of public papers, such as deeds,  warrants, and the like. A feeling of mingled rage and alarm seized the  colonists. It seemed that a deliberate blow was about to be struck at  their liberties. From the day of their founding the colonies had never  been taxed directly except by their own legislatures. Massachusetts, New  York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Virginia at once sent  humble but earnest protests to Parliament against the proposed  innovation.    The act was nevertheless passed in March of the next year, with almost  no opposition. By its provisions, business documents were illegal and  void unless written on the stamped paper. The cheapest stamp cost a  shilling, the price ranging upward from that according to the importance  of the document. The prepared paper had to be paid for in specie, a  hardship indeed in a community where lawsuits were very common, and  whose entire solid coin would not have sufficed to pay the revenue for a  single year. Even bitterest Tories' declared this requirement  indefensible. Another flagrant feature of the act was the provision that  violators of it should be tried without a jury, before a judge whose  only pay came from his own condemnations.      [Illustration: Crowd of well-dressed men standing around a fire.]  Burning the Stamps in New York.      [1765]    The effect upon the colonies was like that of a bomb in a  powder-magazine. The people rose up en masse. In every province the  stamp-distributor was compelled to resign. In Portsmouth, N. H., the  newspaper came out in mourning, and an effigy of the Goddess of Liberty  was carried to the grave. The Connecticut legislature ordered a day of  fasting and prayer kept, and an inventory of powder and ball taken. In  New York a bonfire was made of the stamps in the public square. The  bells in Charleston, S. C., were tolled, and the flags on the ships in  the harbor hung at half-mast. The colonists entered into agreements to  buy no goods from England until the act was repealed. Even mourning  clothes, since they must be imported, were not to be worn, and lamb's  flesh was abjured that more wool might be raised for home manufacture.  England's colonial trade fell off so alarmingly in consequence that  Manchester manufacturers petitioned Parliament to repeal the act,  asserting that nine-tenths of their workmen were idle. Besides these  popular demonstrations, delegates from nine colonies met in New York, in  October, 1765, often called the Stamp Act Congress, and adopted a  declaration of rights, asserting that England had no right to tax them  without their consent. During the days of the Stamp Act excitement, the  term \"colonist\" gave way to \"American,\" and \"English\" to \"British,\" a  term of the deeper opprobrium because Bute, the king's chief adviser,  was a Briton.    Startled by this unexpected resistance, Parliament, in January of the  next year, began to debate repeal. We must in fairness to England look  at both sides of the problem of colonial taxation. As general  administrator of colonial affairs, the English Government naturally  desired a fixed and certain revenue in America, both for frontier  defence against Indians and French and for the payment of colonial  governors.  While each stood ready to defend its own territory, the  colonies were no doubt meanly slow about contributing to any common  fund. They were frequently at loggerheads, too, with their governors  over the question of salaries. On the other hand, the colonists made the  strong plea that self-taxation was their only safeguard against tyranny  of king, Parliament, or governor.    In the great debate which now ensued in Parliament over England's right  to tax America, Mansfield, the greatest constitutional lawyer of his  day, maintained--first, that America was represented in Parliament as  much as Manchester and several other large cities in England which  elected no members to the House of Commons, and yet were taxed; and,  second, that an internal tax, such as that on stamps, was identical in  principle with customs duties, which the colonies had never resisted. In  reply, Pitt, the great champion of the colonies, asserted--first, that  the case of the colonies was not at all like that of Manchester; the  latter happened not to be represented at that time because the election  laws needed reforming, while the colonies, being three thousand miles  away, could in the nature of the case never be adequately represented in  an English Parliament; and, second, that as a matter of fact a sharp  distinction had always, since the Great Charter, been made between  internal taxation and customs duties.    Had the colonies rested their case upon constitutional argument alone it  would have been relatively weak. While it was then a question, and will  be forever, whether the American settlements were king's colonies,  Parliament's colonies, or neither, but peculiar communities which had  resulted from growth, the English lawyers had a good deal of logic on  their side. Unconstitutional measures had indeed been resorted to--the  writs of assistance, taking Americans beyond sea for trial, internal  taxation; yet the real grievance lay far less in these things than in  the fact that the English constitution itself was working in a manner  contrary to colonial interests. Social considerations, too, accounted  for more bitterness than has usually been thought. Our fathers hated the  presence here of a privileged class.    George III.'s policy was therefore wiser legally than politically. This  was, in fact, his ministry's capital mistake--like Lord Salisbury's in  respect to Ireland in 1888--that it had too great regard for the mere  legal aspect of the question, ignoring the practical. The colonists were  too numerous, powerful, and far away, longer to be governed from home,  at least by the old plan. To attempt perpetuation of the old regime  might be lawful, but was certainly impracticable and stupid. Hence  Americans like Jefferson showed themselves consummate politicians in  going beyond Pitt's contention from the constitution and from precedent,  and appealing to the \"natural rights\" of the colonists. \"Our rights,\"  said Otis, in substance, \"do not rest on a charter, but are inherent in  us as men.\" \"The people\" said John Adams in 1765, \"have rights  antecedent to all earthly government.\"    [1767]    The Stamp Act was repealed in February. Its principle, however, was  immediately re-asserted by the \"Declaratory Act,\" in which Parliament  claimed power over the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever.\" The repeal  caused great rejoicing in America; but neither king nor Parliament had  changed policy respecting colonial affairs. There soon followed, in  rapid succession, that series of blundering acts of oppression which  completed the work begun by the Stamp Act, and drove the colonists into  rebellion.    In 1767 duties were laid upon glass, paper, painters' colors, and tea.  Massachusetts, again taking the lead, sent a circular-letter to all the  colonies, proposing a united supplication to the throne. For refusal to  rescind this letter the Massachusetts assembly was dissolved at the  command of the angry king. This refusal was the first denial of the  king's prerogative; only the authority of Parliament had been resisted  before. The soul of the colonial cause in Massachusetts at this time was  Samuel Adams, of Boston, \"the last of the Puritans,\" a man of powerful  and logical mind, intrepid heart, and incorruptible patriotism.  America's debt to him for his work in these early years cannot be  estimated. At this juncture he organized committees of safety and  correspondence throughout Massachusetts, which led to the formation of  such committees in the other colonies. They did an invaluable work in  binding the scattered sections together, and providing for emergencies.    [1768]    The Billeting Act, which required the colonists to lodge and feed the  British troops quartered among them, added fuel to the flames. In 1768  the New York legislature refused to comply, and Parliament suspended its  legislative functions.    [1770]    In the fall of the same year, seizing as a pretext two ship-riots which  had occurred in the summer, the king stationed four regiments in Boston.  Public sentiment was shocked and indignant at this establishment of a  military guard over a peaceable community. The presence of the soldiers  was a constant source of irritation. Frequent altercations occurred  between the soldiers and the lower class of citizens. The trouble  culminated in the Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770. A squad of soldiers,  set upon by a mob of men and boys, fired into the crowd, killing three  persons and wounding eight others. That the soldiers had considerable  justification is proved by the fact that a jury acquitted all but two,  who were convicted of manslaughter, and branded. But exaggerated reports  of the occurrence spread like wildfire throughout the colonies, and  wrought powerfully for hatred against England.    [1772]    During the next two or three years there was comparative quiet.  Massachusetts, it is true, under the tutelage of Samuel Adams, grew more  radical in its demands. In 1772 the committee of Boston issued a  statement of grievances, adding, as new complaints, the sending of  persons to England for trial, restraints upon colonial manufacturers,  and a rumored plan to establish bishops over America. This statement was  approved by all the colonies, and was sent to Franklin in London. The  country as a whole, however, was weary of the strife, and would gladly  have returned to the old cordial relations with the mother-land.      [Illustration: Scene in the square of Boston.
