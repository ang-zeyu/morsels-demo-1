He need not set himself to  develop equality, but he need not set himself to misunderstand it. He  may at least understand what Jefferson and Lincoln meant, and he may  possibly find some assistance in this task by reading what they said. He  may realise that equality is not some crude fairy tale about all men  being equally tall or equally tricky; which we not only cannot believe  but cannot believe in anybody believing. It is an absolute of morals by  which all men have a value invariable and indestructible and a dignity  as intangible as death. He may at least be a philosopher and see that  equality is an idea; and not merely one of these soft-headed sceptics  who, having risen by low tricks to high places, drink bad champagne in  tawdry hotel lounges, and tell each other twenty times over, with  unwearied iteration, that equality is an illusion.    In truth it is inequality that is the illusion. The extreme  disproportion between men, that we seem to see in life, is a thing of  changing lights and lengthening shadows, a twilight full of fancies and  distortions. We find a man famous and cannot live long enough to find  him forgotten; we see a race dominant and cannot linger to see it decay.  It is the experience of men that always returns to the equality of men;  it is the average that ultimately justifies the average man. It is when  men have seen and suffered much and come at the end of more elaborate  experiments, that they see men as men under an equal light of death and  daily laughter; and none the less mysterious for being many. Nor is it  in vain that these Western democrats have sought the blazonry of their  flag in that great multitude of immortal lights that endure behind the  fires we see, and gathered them into the corner of Old Glory whose  ground is like the glittering night. For veritably, in the spirit as  well as in the symbol, suns and moons and meteors pass and fill our  skies with a fleeting and almost theatrical conflagration; and wherever  the old shadow stoops upon the earth, the stars return.          _A Meditation in a New York Hotel_      All this must begin with an apology and not an apologia. When I went  wandering about the States disguised as a lecturer, I was well aware  that I was not sufficiently well disguised to be a spy. I was even in  the worst possible position to be a sight-seer. A lecturer to American  audiences can hardly be in the holiday mood of a sight-seer. It is  rather the audience that is sight-seeing; even if it is seeing a rather  melancholy sight. Some say that people come to see the lecturer and not  to hear him; in which case it seems rather a pity that he should disturb  and distress their minds with a lecture. He might merely display himself  on a stand or platform for a stipulated sum; or be exhibited like a  monster in a menagerie. The circus elephant is not expected to make a  speech. But it is equally true that the circus elephant is not allowed  to write a book. His impressions of travel would be somewhat sketchy and  perhaps a little over-specialised. In merely travelling from circus to  circus he would, so to speak, move in rather narrow circles. Jumbo the  great elephant (with whom I am hardly so ambitious as to compare  myself), before he eventually went to the Barnum show, passed a  considerable and I trust happy part of his life in Regent's Park. But if  he had written a book on England, founded on his impressions of the Zoo,  it might have been a little disproportionate and even misleading in its  version of the flora and fauna of that country. He might imagine that  lions and leopards were commoner than they are in our hedgerows and  country lanes, or that the head and neck of a giraffe was as native to  our landscapes as a village spire. And that is why I apologise in  anticipation for a probable lack of proportion in this work. Like the  elephant, I may have seen too much of a special enclosure where a  special sort of lions are gathered together. I may exaggerate the  territorial, as distinct from the vertical space occupied by the  spiritual giraffe; for the giraffe may surely be regarded as an example  of Uplift, and is even, in a manner of speaking, a high-brow. Above all,  I shall probably make generalisations that are much too general; and are  insufficient through being exaggerative. To this sort of doubt all my  impressions are subject; and among them the negative generalisation with  which I shall begin this rambling meditation on American hotels.    In all my American wanderings I never saw such a thing as an inn. They  may exist; but they do not arrest the traveller upon every road as they  do in England and in Europe. The saloons no longer existed when I was  there, owing to the recent reform which restricted intoxicants to the  wealthier classes. But we feel that the saloons have been there; if one  may so express it, their absence is still present. They remain in the  structure of the street and the idiom of the language. But the saloons  were not inns. If they had been inns, it would have been far harder even  for the power of modern plutocracy to root them out. There will be a  very different chase when the White Hart is hunted to the forests or  when the Red Lion turns to bay. But people could not feel about the  American saloon as they will feel about the English inns. They could not  feel that the Prohibitionist, that vulgar chucker-out, was chucking  Chaucer out of the Tabard and Shakespeare out of the Mermaid. In justice  to the American Prohibitionists it must be realised that they were not  doing quite such desecration; and that many of them felt the saloon a  specially poisonous sort of place. They did feel that drinking-places  were used only as drug-shops. So they have effected the great  reconstruction, by which it will be necessary to use only drug-shops as  drinking-places. But I am not dealing here with the problem of  Prohibition except in so far as it is involved in the statement that the  saloons were in no sense inns. Secondly, of course, there are the  hotels. There are indeed. There are hotels toppling to the stars, hotels  covering the acreage of villages, hotels in multitudinous number like a  mob of Babylonian or Assyrian monuments; but the hotels also are not  inns.    Broadly speaking, there is only one hotel in America. The pattern of it,  which is a very rational pattern, is repeated in cities as remote from  each other as the capitals of European empires. You may find that hotel  rising among the red blooms of the warm spring woods of Nebraska, or  whitened with Canadian snows near the eternal noise of Niagara. And  before touching on this solid and simple pattern itself, I may remark  that the same system of symmetry runs through all the details of the  interior. As one hotel is like another hotel, so one hotel floor is like  another hotel floor. If the passage outside your bedroom door, or  hallway as it is called, contains, let us say, a small table with a  green vase and a stuffed flamingo, or some trifle of the sort, you may  be perfectly certain that there is exactly the same table, vase, and  flamingo on every one of the thirty-two landings of that towering  habitation. This is where it differs most perhaps from the crooked  landings and unexpected levels of the old English inns, even when they  call themselves hotels. To me there was something weird, like a magic  multiplication, in the exquisite sameness of these suites. It seemed to  suggest the still atmosphere of some eerie psychological story. I once  myself entertained the notion of a story, in which a man was to be  prevented from entering his house (the scene of some crime or calamity)  by people who painted and furnished the next house to look exactly like  it; the assimilation going to the most fantastic lengths, such as  altering the numbering of houses in the street. I came to America and  found an hotel fitted and upholstered throughout for the enactment of my  phantasmal fraud. I offer the skeleton of my story with all humility to  some of the admirable lady writers of detective stories in America, to  Miss Carolyn Wells, or Miss Mary Roberts Rhinehart, or Mrs. A. K. Green  of the unforgotten Leavenworth Case. Surely it might be possible for the  unsophisticated Nimrod K. Moose, of Yellow Dog Flat, to come to New York  and be entangled somehow in this net of repetitions or recurrences.  Surely something tells me that his beautiful daughter, the Rose of Red  Murder Gulch, might seek for him in vain amid the apparently  unmistakable surroundings of the thirty-second floor, while he was being  quietly butchered by the floor-clerk on the thirty-third floor, an agent  of the Green Claw (that formidable organisation); and all because the  two floors looked exactly alike to the virginal Western eye. The  original point of my own story was that the man to be entrapped walked  into his own house after all, in spite of it being differently painted  and numbered, simply because he was absent-minded and used to taking a  certain number of mechanical steps. This would not work in the hotel;  because a lift has no habits. It is typical of the real tameness of  machinery, that even when we talk of a man turning mechanically we only  talk metaphorically; for it is something that a mechanism cannot do. But  I think there is only one real objection to my story of Mr. Moose in the  New York hotel. And that is unfortunately a rather fatal one. It is that  far away in the remote desolation of Yellow Dog, among those outlying  and outlandish rocks that almost seem to rise beyond the sunset, there  is undoubtedly an hotel of exactly the same sort, with all its floors  exactly the same.    Anyhow the general "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27262"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 3, May 1906 (#4)"],[1," done and retort on us that these, our  wealthiest and most respected citizens, not being legally divorced and  hence not being legally married again, are no better than he and his  so-called wife.\"    The ladies looked at each other in consternation. Evidently the thought  had not suggested itself to them. Mrs. X. Y. Z. Asterbilt (nee Clewbel)  rose and in a voice choked with emotion said:    \"Speaking for myself as well as for some of the other ladies, members of  this organization, who are temporarily declassee, so to speak, by this  decree of the Supreme Court, I beg that you will do nothing to call  undue attention to us, until we have arranged matters so that our wealth  will enable us to have that legislation which is necessary to make us  respectable women again.\"    \"Is it true,\" I asked, \"that you have sent an invitation to Madame  Andreieva to meet you to discuss the steps to be taken to reinstate  yourselves?\"    \"It is true, but the extraordinary creature returned word that as a lady  of good standing in her own country she did not feel that she could  afford to associate with women whom the courts of this country held to  be living in shame.\"    \"Did you ever!\" cried Mrs. Blanderocks. \"But it shows us that we must be  careful. Mrs. Grant, you have had experience in such matters, suppose  you retire and draw up a set of resolutions that will not expose us to  the ribald and unseemly comments of the light-minded.\"    Of course I accepted the task, fully realizing its gravity, and  following is the resolution I brought back with me:    \"_Whereas_, Maxim Gorky, recognized in the world of letters as a man of  genius, and in the world at large as a man of great soul, high purpose  and pure nature, having come to this country accompanied by a lady whom  he considers and treats as his wife; and    \"_Whereas_, The wealthy, and therefore the better classes, tumbled all  over themselves in order to exploit him as a lion; and    \"_Whereas_, He had not the wisdom and craft and sense of puritanical  respectability to pretend that he did not know the lady he believed his  wife, and to whom he believes himself united by a law higher than that  of man; and    \"_Whereas_, He was guileless enough to believe he had come to a free  country where purity of motive and of conduct would take precedence of  hollow and rotten forms; and    \"_Whereas_, He did not know that the American people practise polygamy  secretly, while condemning it in words, and that the United States  Senate has been nearly two years in pretending to try to find a  polygamist in their midst; and    \"_Whereas_, He was so injudicious as to come here with a defective  divorce just at a time when our Supreme Court was making the divorce of  some of us, the gilded favorites of fortune, defective; and    \"_Whereas_, He had the audacity to proclaim himself a Socialist, which  is the same thing as saying that he is opposed to special privilege, and  is in favor of the abolition of property in land and in the tools of  labor--in other and plainer words, is against Us; and    \"_Whereas_, He is only a foreigner, anyhow, and no longer available as a  toy and plaything for us; therefore be it    \"_Resolved_, That this man, Gorky, be used as a means of proclaiming our  extraordinary virtue to the world at large, as a robber cries stop thief  in order to direct attention from himself; that accordingly he be  treated with the utmost outrageous discourtesy and hounded from hotel to  hotel on the ground that such places by no chance harbor men and women  unless they have passed through the matrimonial mill; that we withdraw  our patronage from the revolution in Russia--not being seriously  interested in it anyhow--and that we will show our contempt for  revolutionary patriots by entertaining the rottenest grand duke in  Russia if only he will come over to us, bringing his whole harem if he  wish; that he is a reproach to us while he remains in this country, and  that it is the sense of this great organization that he and the lady who  is his wife in the highest sense shall be deported.\"    The resolution was not passed.    I have been expelled from the association.    [Illustration]          COMRADE.    By MAXIM GORKY.    Translated from the French translation by S. PERSKY, published in  \"L'Aurore,\" Paris.      ALL in that city was strange, incomprehensible. Churches in great number  pointed their many-tinted steeples toward the sky, in gleaming colors;  but the walls and the chimneys of the factories rose still higher, and  the temples were crushed between the massive facades of commercial  houses, like marvelous flowers sprung up among the ruins, out of the  dust. And when the bells called the faithful to prayer, their brazen  sounds, sliding along the iron roofs, vanished, leaving no traces in the  narrow gaps which separated the houses.    They were always large, and sometimes beautiful, these dwellings.  Deformed people, ciphers, ran about like gray mice in the tortuous  streets from morning till evening; and their eyes, full of covetousness,  looked for bread or for some distraction; other men placed at the  crossways watched with a vigilant and ferocious air, that the weak  should, without murmuring, submit themselves to the strong. The strong  were the rich: everyone believed that money alone gives power and  liberty. All wanted power because all were slaves. The luxury of the  rich begot the envy and hate of the poor; no one knew any finer music  than the ring of gold; that is why each was the enemy of his neighbor,  and cruelty reigned mistress.    Sometimes the sun shone over the city, but life therein was always wan,  and the people like shadows. At night they lit a mass of joyous lights;  and then famishing women went out into the streets to sell their  caresses to the highest bidder. Everywhere floated an odor of victuals,  and the sullen and voracious look of the people grew. Over the city  hovered a groan of misery, stifled, without strength to make itself  heard.    Every one led an irksome, unquiet life; a general hostility was the  rule. A few citizens only considered themselves just, but these were the  most cruel, and their ferocity provoked that of the herd. All wanted to  live; and no one knew or could follow freely the pathway of his desires;  like an insatiable monster, the Present enveloped in its powerful and  vigorous arms the man who marched toward the future, and in that slimy  embrace sapped away his strength. Full of anguish and perplexity, the  man paused, powerless before the hideous aspect of this life: with its  thousands of eyes, infinitely sad in their expression, it looked into  his heart, asking him for it knew not what,--and then the radiant images  of the future died in his soul; a groan out of the powerlessness of the  man mingled in the discordant chorus of lamentations and tears from poor  human creatures tormented by life.    Tedium and inquietude reigned everywhere, and sometimes terror. And the  dull and somber city, the stone buildings atrociously lined one against  the other, shutting in the temples, were for men a prison, rebuffing the  rays of the sun. And the music of life was smothered by the cry of  suffering and rage, by the whisper of dissimulated hate, by the  threatening bark of cruelty, by the voluptuous cry of violence.    In the sullen agitation caused by trial and suffering, in the feverish  struggle of misery, in the vile slime of egoism, in the subsoils of the  houses wherein vegetated Poverty, the creator of Riches, solitary  dreamers full of faith in Man, strangers to all, prophets of seditions,  moved about like sparks issued from some far-off hearthstone of justice.  Secretly they brought into these wretched holes tiny fertile seeds of a  doctrine simple and grand;--and sometimes rudely, with lightnings in  their eyes, and sometimes mild and tender, they sowed this clear and  burning truth in the sombre hearts of these slaves, transformed into  mute, blind instruments by the strength of the rapacious, by the will of  the cruel. And these sullen beings, these oppressed ones, listened  without much belief to the music of the new words,--the music for which  their hearts had long been waiting. Little by little they lifted up  their heads, and tore the meshes of the web of lies wherewith their  oppressors had enwound them. In their existence, made up of silent and  contained rage, in their hearts envenomed by numberless wrongs, in their  consciences encumbered by the dupings of the wisdom of the strong, in  this dark and laborious life, all penetrated with the bitterness of  humiliation, had resounded a simple word:    Comrade.    It was not a new word; they had heard it and pronounced it themselves;  but until then it had seemed to them void of sense, like all other words  dulled by usage, and which one may forget without losing anything. But  now this word, strong and clear, had another sound; a soul was singing  in it,--the facets of it shone brilliant as a diamond. The wretched  accepted this word, and at first uttered it gently, cradling it in their  hearts like a mother rocking her new-born child and admiring it. And the  more they searched the luminous soul of the word, the more fascinating  it seemed to them.    \"Comrade,\" said they.    And they felt that this word had come to unite the whole world, to lift  all men up to the summits of liberty and bind them with new ties, the  strong ties of mutual respect, respect for the liberties of others in  the name of one's own liberty.    When this word had engraved itself upon the hearts of the slaves, they  ceased to be slaves; and one day they announced their transformation to  the city in this great human formula:    I WILL NOT.    Then life was suspended, for it is they who are the motor force of life,  they and no other. The water supply stopped, the fire went out, the city  was plunged in darkness. The masters began to tremble like children.  "]]]
