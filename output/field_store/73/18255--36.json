You are all wrong, little chap, for all your pretty  curiosity, and the stamp of your little foot that quite wins my heart.  Perhaps I am to blame, after all; anyway, I'll teach you better now.\"    At the thought I picked up a large stone and sent it crashing, jumping,  tearing down the hillside straight at him. All his bravado vanished  like a wink. Up went his flag, and away he went over the logs and rocks  of the great hillside; where presently I heard his mother running in a  great circle till she found him with her nose, thanks to the wood wires  and the wind's message, and led him away out of danger.    One who lives for a few weeks in the wilderness, with eyes and ears  open, soon finds that, instead of the lawlessness and blind chance which  seem to hold sway there, he lives in the midst of law and order--an  order of things much older than that to which he is accustomed, with  which it is not well to interfere. I was uneasy, following the little  deer path through the twilight stillness; and my uneasiness was not  decreased when I found on a log, within fifty yards of the spot where  the fawn first appeared, the signs of a big lucivee, with plenty of  fawn's hair and fine-cracked bones to tell me what he had eaten for his  midnight dinner.           *       *       *       *       *    Down at the lower end of the same deer path, where it stopped at the  lake to let the wild things drink, was a little brook. Outside the mouth  of this brook, among the rocks, was a deep pool; and in the pool lived  some big trout. I was there one night, some two weeks later, trying to  catch some of the big trout for my next breakfast.    Those were wise fish. It was of no use to angle for them by day any  more. They knew all the flies in my book; could tell the new Jenny Lind  from the old Bumble Bee before it struck the water; and seemed to know  perfectly, both by instinct and experience, that they were all frauds,  which might as well be called Jenny Bee and Bumble Lind for any sweet  reasonableness that was in them. Besides all this, the water was warm;  the trout were logy and would not rise.    By night, however, the case was different. A few of the trout would  leave the pool and prowl along the shores in shallow water to see what  tidbits the darkness might bring, in the shape of night bugs and  careless piping frogs and sleepy minnows. Then, if you built a fire on  the beach and cast a white-winged fly across the path of the firelight,  you would sometimes get a big one.    It was fascinating sport always, whether the trout were rising or not.  One had to fish with his ears, and keep most of his wits in his hand,  ready to strike quick and hard when the moment came, after an hour of  casting. Half the time you would not see your fish at all, but only hear  the savage plunge as he swirled down with your fly. At other times, as  you struck sharply at the plunge, your fly would come back to you, or  tangle itself up in unseen snags; and far out, where the verge of the  firelight rippled away into darkness, you would see a sharp wave-wedge  shooting away, which told you that your trout was only a musquash.  Swimming quietly by, he had seen you and your fire, and slapped his tail  down hard on the water to make you jump. That is a way Musquash has in  the night, so that he can make up his mind what queer thing you are and  what you are doing.    All the while, as you fish, the great dark woods stand close about you,  silent, listening. The air is full of scents and odors that steal abroad  only by night, while the air is dew-laden. Strange cries, calls,  squeaks, rustlings run along the hillside, or float in from the water,  or drop down from the air overhead, to make you guess and wonder what  wood folk are abroad at such unseemly hours, and what they are about. So  that it is good to fish by night, as well as by day, and go home with  heart and head full, even though your creel be empty.    I was standing very still by my fire, waiting for a big trout that had  risen and missed my fly to regain his confidence, when I heard cautious  rustlings in the brush behind me. I turned instantly, and there were two  great glowing spots, the eyes of a deer, flashing out of the dark  woods. A swift rustle, and two more coals glow lower down, flashing and  scintillating with strange colors; and then two more; and I know that  the doe and her fawns are there, stopped and fascinated on their way to  drink by the great wonder of the light, and by the witchery of the  dancing shadows that rush up at timid wild things, as if to frighten  them, but only jump over them and back again, as if inviting them to  join the silent play.    I knelt down quietly beside my fire, slipping on a great roll of birch  bark which blazed up brightly, filling the woods with light. There,  under a spruce, where a dark shadow had been a moment agone, stood the  mother, her eyes all ablaze with the wonder of the light; now staring  steadfastly into the fire; now starting nervously, with low questioning  snorts, as a troop of shadows ran up to play hop-scotch with the little  ones, which stood close behind her, one on either side.    A moment only it lasted. Then one fawn--I knew the heedless one, even in  the firelight, by his face and by his bright-dappled Joseph's coat--came  straight towards me, stopping to stare with flashing eyes when the fire  jumped up, and then to stamp his little foot at the shadows to show them  that he was not afraid.    [Illustration: \"HER EYES ALL ABLAZE WITH THE WONDER OF THE LIGHT\"]    The mother called him anxiously; but still he came on, stamping  prettily. She grew uneasy, trotting back and forth in a half circle,  warning, calling, pleading. Then, as he came between her and the fire,  and his little shadow stretched away up the hill where she was, showing  how far away he was from her and how near the light, she broke away from  its fascination with an immense effort: _Ka-a-a-h! ka-a-a-h!_ the hoarse  cry rang through the startled woods like a pistol shot; and she bounded  away, her white flag shining like a wave crest in the night to guide her  little ones.    The second fawn followed her instantly; but the heedless one barely  swung his head to see where she was going, and then came on towards the  light, staring and stamping in foolish wonder.    I watched him a little while, fascinated myself by his beauty, his  dainty motions, his soft ears with a bright oval of light about them,  his wonderful eyes glowing like burning rainbows kindled by the  firelight. Far behind him the mother's cry ran back and forth along the  hillside. Suddenly it changed; a danger note leaped into it; and again I  heard the call to follow and the crash of brush as she leaped away. I  remembered the lynx and the sad little history written on the log above.  As the quickest way of saving the foolish youngster, I kicked my fire  to pieces and walked out towards him. Then, as the wonder vanished in  darkness and the scent of the man poured up to him on the lake's breath,  the little fellow bounded away--alas! straight up the deer path, at  right angles to the course his mother had taken a moment before.    Five minutes later I heard the mother calling a strange note in the  direction he had taken, and went up the deer path very quietly to  investigate. At the top of the ridge, where the path dropped away into a  dark narrow valley with dense underbrush on either side, I heard the  fawn answering her, below me among the big trees, and knew instantly  that something had happened. He called continuously, a plaintive cry of  distress, in the black darkness of the spruces. The mother ran around  him in a great circle, calling him to come; while he lay helpless in the  same spot, telling her he could not, and that she must come to him. So  the cries went back and forth in the listening night,--_Hoo-wuh_, \"come  here.\" _Bla-a-a, blr-r-t,_ \"I can't; come here.\" _Ka-a-a-h, ka-a-a-h!_  \"danger, follow!\"--and then the crash of brush as she rushed away  followed by the second fawn, whom she must save, though she abandoned  the heedless one to prowlers of the night.    It was clear enough what had happened. The cries of the wilderness all  have their meaning, if one but knows how to interpret them. Running  through the dark woods his untrained feet had missed their landing, and  he lay now under some rough windfall, with a broken leg to remind him of  the lesson he had neglected so long.    I was stealing along towards him, feeling my way among the trees in the  darkness, stopping every moment to listen to his cry to guide me, when a  heavy rustle came creeping down the hill and passed close before me.  Something, perhaps, in the sound--a heavy, though almost noiseless  onward push which only one creature in the woods can possibly  make--something, perhaps, in a faint new odor in the moist air told me  instantly that keener ears than mine had heard the cry; that Mooween the  bear had left his blueberry patch, and was stalking the heedless fawn,  whom he knew, by the hearing of his ears, to have become separated from  his watchful mother in the darkness.    I regained the path silently--though Mooween heeds nothing when his game  is afoot--and ran back to the canoe for my rifle. Ordinarily a bear is  timid as a rabbit; but I had never met one so late at night before, and  knew not how he would act should I take his game away. Besides, there  is everything in the feeling with which one approaches an animal. If one  comes timidly, doubtfully, the animal knows it; and if one comes swift,  silent, resolute, with his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#4)"],[1,"himself free from the many confusions and  affectations which surround him in the endeavor.          CHAPTER II    TOOLS           Average Number of Tools required by Carvers--Selection for       Beginners--Description of Tools--Position when in Use--Acquisition       by Degrees.      We will suppose that the student is anxious to make a practical  commencement to his studies. The first consideration will be to procure  a set of tools, and we propose in this place to describe those which  will answer the purposes of a beginner, as well as to look generally at  others in common use among craftsmen.    The tools used by carvers consist for the most part of chisels and  gouges of different shapes and sizes. The number of tools required by  professional carvers for one piece of work varies in proportion to the  elaborateness of the carving to be done. They may use from half a dozen  on simple work up to twenty or thirty for the more intricate carvings,  this number being a selection out of a larger stock reaching perhaps as  many as a hundred or more. Many of these tools vary only in size and  sweep of cutting edge. Thus, chisels and gouges are to be had ranging  from 1/16th of an inch to 1 inch wide, with curves or \"sweeps\" in each  size graduated between a semicircle to a curve almost flat. Few carvers,  however, possess such a complete stock of tools as would be represented  by one of each size and shape manufactured; such a thing is not  required: an average number of, say seventy tools, will always give a  sufficient variety of size and sweep for general purposes; few pieces of  work will require the use of more than half of these in its execution.    The beginner, however, need not possess more than from twelve to  twenty-four, and may even make a start with fewer. It is a good plan to  learn the uses of a few tools before acquiring a complete set, as by  this means, when difficulties are felt in the execution of work, a tool  of known description is sought for and purchased with a foreknowledge of  its advantages. This is the surest way to gain a distinct knowledge of  the varieties of each kind of tool, and their application to the  different purposes of design.    The following list of tools (see Figs. 1 and 2) will be found sufficient  for all the occasions of study: beginning by the purchase of the first  section, Nos. 1 to 17, and adding others one by one until a set is made  up of twenty-four tools. The tools should be selected as near the sizes  and shapes shown in the illustration as possible. The curved and  straight strokes represent the shape of the actual cuts made by pressing  the tools down perpendicularly into a piece of wood. This, in the case  of gouges, is generally called the \"sweep.\"    Nos. 1, 2, 3 are gouges, of sweeps varying from one almost flat (No. 1)  to a distinct hollow in No. 3. These tools are made in two forms,  straight-sided and \"spade\"-shaped; an illustration of the spade form is  given on the second page of tools. In purchasing his set of tools the  student should order Nos. 1, 2, 3, 10, 11 in this form. They will be  found to have many advantages, as they conceal less of the wood behind  them and get well into corners inaccessible to straight-sided tools.  They are lighter and more easily sharpened, and are very necessary in  finishing the surface of work, and in shaping out foliage, more  especially such as is undercut.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Nos. 5, 6, 7 are straight gouges graduated in size and sweep. No. 8 is  called a Veiner, because it is often used for making the grooves which  represent veins in leaves. It is a narrow but deep gouge, and is used  for any narrow grooves which may be required, and for outlining the  drawing at starting.    No. 9 is called a V tool or \"parting\" tool, on account of its shape. It  is used for making grooves with straight sides and sharp inner angles at  the bottom. It can be used for various purposes, such as undercutting,  clearing out sharply defined angles, outlining the drawing, etc., etc.  It should be got with a square cutting edge, not beveled off as some are  made. Nos. 10, 11, 12 are flat chisels, or, as they are sometimes  called, \"firmers.\" (Nos. 10 and 11 should be in spade shape.) No. 13 is  also a flat chisel, but it is beveled off to a point, and is called a  \"corner-chisel\"; it is used for getting into difficult corners, and is a  most useful tool when used as a knife for delicate edges or curves.    Nos. 14 and 16 are what are known as \"bent chisels\"; they are used  principally for leveling the ground (or background), and are therefore  also called \"grounders.\" These tools are made with various curves or  bends in their length, but for our present uses one with a bend like  that shown to tool No. 23, Fig. 2, and at _a_ in Fig. 3, will be best;  more bend, as at _b_, would only make the tool unfit for leveling  purposes on a flat ground.    No. 15 is a similar tool, but called a \"corner grounder,\" as it is  beveled off like a corner-chisel.    No. 17 is an additional gouge of very slow sweep and small size. This is  a very handy little tool, and serves a variety of purposes when you come  to finishing the surface.    These seventeen tools will make up a very useful set for the beginner,  and should serve him for a long time, or at least until he really begins  to feel the want of others; then he may get the remainder shown on Fig.  2.    Nos. 18, 19, 20 are deep gouges, having somewhat straight sides; they  are used where grooves are set deeply, and when they are required to  change in section from deep and narrow to wide and shallow. This is done  by turning the tool on its side, which brings the flatter sweep into  action, thus changing the shape of the hollow. Nos. 21, 22 are gouges,  but are called \"bent gouges\"--\"front bent\" in this case, \"back bent\"  when the cutting \"sweep\" is turned upside down. It is advisable when  selecting these tools to get them as shown in the illustration, with a  very easy curve in their bend; they are more generally useful so, as  quick bends are only good for very deep hollows. These tools are used  for making grooves in hollow places where an ordinary gouge will not  work, owing to its meeting the opposing fiber of the wood.    No. 23 is a similar tool, but very \"easy\" both in its \"sweep\" and  bend--the sweep should be little more than recognizable as a curve. This  tool may be used as a grounder when the wood is slightly hollow, or  liable to tear up under the flat grounder.    No. 24 is called a \"Maccaroni\" tool. This is used for clearing out the  ground close against leaves or other projections; as it has two square  sides it can be used right and left.    In the illustration, Fig 3, _a_ shows the best form of grounding tool;  _b_ is little or no use for this purpose, as it curves up too suddenly  for work on a flat ground. It is a good thing to have the handles of  tools made of different colored woods, as it assists the carver in  picking them out quickly from those lying ready for use.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    When in use, the tools should be laid out in front of the carver if  possible, and with their points toward him, in order that he may see the  shape and choose quickly the one he wants.    The tempering of tools is a very important factor in their efficiency.  It is only of too common occurrence to find many of the tools  manufactured of late years unfit for use on account of their softness of  metal. There is nothing more vexatious to a carver than working with a  tool which turns over its cutting edge, even in soft wood; such tools  should be returned to the agent who sold them.    With a selection from the above tools, acquired by degrees in the manner  described, almost any kind of work may be done. There is no need  whatever to have a tool for every curve of the design. These can readily  be made by using straight chisels in combination with such gouges as we  possess, or by sweeping the curves along their sides with a chisel used  knife fashion. No really beautiful curves can be made by merely  following the curves of gouges, however various their sweeps, as they  are all segments of circles.    Tools generally come from the manufacturer ground, but not sharpened. As  the student must in any case learn how to sharpen his tools, it will be  just as well to get them in that way rather than ready for use. As this  process of sharpening tools is a very important one, it must be reserved  for another place. Should tools be seriously blunted or broken they must  be reground. This can be done by the carver, either on a grindstone or a  piece of gritty York stone, care being taken to repeat the original  bevel; or they may be sent to a tool shop where they are in the habit  of grinding carving tools.    Catalogues of tools may be had from good makers; they will be found to  consist mainly in a large variety of the tools already mentioned. Those  which are very much bent or curved are intended for special application  to elaborate and difficult passages in carving, and need not concern the  student until he comes to find the actual want of such shapes; such, for  instance, as bent parting tools and back bent gouges.    In addition to the above tools, carvers occasionally use one called a  \"Router.\" This is a kind of plane with a narrow perpendicular blade. It  is used for digging or \"routing\" out the wood in places where it is to  be sunk to form a ground. It is not a tool to be recommended for the use  of beginners, who should learn to make sufficiently even backgrounds  without the aid of mechanical contrivances. Carvers also use the  \"Rifler,\" which is a bent file. This is useful for very fine work in  hard wood, and also for roughly approximating to rounded forms before  finishing with the tools.    A few joiner's tools are very useful to the carver, and should form  part of his equipment. A wide chisel, say about 1-1/4 in."]]]
