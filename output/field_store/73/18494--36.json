One cannot build villages, or provide  extensive railroad facilities for them, nor does one regard them in  the impersonal way that the \"Do-with\" family, or Mr. Wells' soldiers,  are regarded, as incidentals in a general scheme of things.    These beings hold the centre of their little stage. They call for  affection and solicitude, and the kind of play into which they fit is  more limited in scope, less stirring to the imagination, but more  usual in the experience of children, because play material of this  type is more plentifully provided than is any other and, centering  attention as it does on the furnishings and utensils of the home,  requires less contact with or information about, the world outside and  its activities to provide the mental content for interesting play.    [Illustration: A \"Furnished Apartment\" at the Ethical Culture School]    In the epochs of play development interest in these larger scale toys  precedes that in more complicated schemes with smaller ones. Mr.  Wells' stress on the desirability of a toy soldier population really  reflects an adult view. For play on the toy soldier and paper doll  scale develops latest of all, and because of the opportunities it  affords for schemes of correspondingly greater mental content makes  special appeal to the adult imagination.    Play material smaller than the \"Do-with\" models and better adapted to  this latest period than are either soldiers or paper dolls remains one  of the unexplored possibilities for the toy trade of the future.    [Illustration: Supplementary (A small toy train.)]    [Illustration: A play laundry.]*      HOUSEKEEPING PLAY    Materials for housekeeping play are of two general kinds, according to  size--those intended for the convenience of dolls, and those of larger  scale for children's use. The larger kind should be strong enough and  well enough made to permit of actual processes.    Plentiful as such materials are in the shops, it is difficult to  assemble anything approaching a complete outfit on the same size  scale. One may spend days in the attempt to get together one as  satisfactory as that pictured here. The reason seems to be that for  considerations of trade such toys are made and sold in sets of a few  pieces each. If dealers would go a step further and plan their sets in  series, made to scale and supplementing each other, they would better  serve the requirements of play, and, it would seem, their own  interests as well.      STOREKEEPING PLAY    From housekeeping play to storekeeping play is a logical step and one  abounding in possibilities for leading interest beyond the horizon  line of home environment.    Better than any toy equipment and within reach of every household  budget is a \"store\" like the one pictured here where real cartons,  boxes, tins and jars are used.    [Illustration: A \"Grocery Store\" at the Ethical Culture School]    Schools can often obtain new unfilled cartons from manufacturers. The  Fels-Naphtha and National Biscuit companies are especially cordial to  requests of this kind, and cartons from the latter firm are good for  beginners, as prices are plainly marked and involve only dime and  nickel computation. The magazine \"Educational Foundations\" maintains a  department which collects such equipment and furnishes it to public  schools on their subscribers' list.    Sample packages add to interest and a small supply of actual staples  in bulk, or of sand, sawdust, chaff, etc., for weighing and measuring  should be provided as well as paper, string, and paper bags of  assorted sizes.    Small scales, and inexpensive sets of standard measures, dry and  liquid, can be obtained of Milton Bradley and other school supply  houses. A toy telephone and toy money will add \"content,\" and for  older children a \"price and sign marker\" (Milton Bradley) is a  valuable addition.    The School of Childhood (Pittsburgh) list includes the following  miscellaneous articles for house and store play:        spoons      various sized boxes      stones      pebbles      buttons      shells      spools      bells      enlarged sticks of the kindergarten      ribbon bolts filled with sand      rice      shot      bottles, etc.      CRAFT AND COLOR MATERIALS    Materials of this kind are a valuable part of any play equipment. Of  the large assortment carried by kindergarten and school supply houses  the following are best adapted to the needs of the play laboratory:      _Modelling Materials_--Modelling clay and plasticine, far from being  the same, are supplementary materials, each adapted to uses for which  the other is unsuited.    _Weaving Materials_--Raphia, basketry reed, colored worsteds, cotton  roving, jute and macrame cord can be used for many purposes.    _Material for Paper Work_--Heavy oak tag, manila, and bogus papers for  cutting and construction come in sheets of different sizes. Colored  papers, both coated (colored on one side) and engine colored (colored  on both sides) are better adapted to \"laboratory purposes\" when  obtainable in large sheets instead of the regulation kindergarten  squares. Colored tissue papers, scissors and library paste are always  in demand.    _Color Materials_--Crayons, water color paints, chalks (for blackboard  use) are best adapted to the needs of play when supplied in a variety  of colors and shades. For drawing and painting coarse paper should be  furnished in quantity and in sheets of differing sizes.    \"_If children are let alone with paper and crayons they will quickly  learn to use these toys quite as effectively as they do blocks and  dolls._\"    [Illustration: Children playing with wagon.]*      TOYS FOR ACTIVE PLAY AND OUTDOOR TOOLS    Among the many desirable _toys for active play_ the following deserve  \"honorable mention\":        Express wagon      Sled      Horse reins      \"Coaster\" or \"Scooter\"      Velocipede (and other adaptations of the bicycle for beginners)      Football (small size Association ball)      Indoor baseball      Rubber balls (various sizes)      Bean bags      Steamer quoits    As in the case of the carpenter's bench it is poor economy to supply  any but good _tools_ for the yard and garden. Even the best garden  sets for children are so far inferior to those made for adults as to  render them unsatisfactory and expensive by comparison. It is  therefore better to get light weight pieces in the smaller standard  sizes and cut down long wooden handles for greater convenience. The  one exception to be noted is the boy's shovel supplied by the Peter  Henderson company. This is in every respect as strong and well made as  the regulation sizes and a complete series to the same scale and of  the same standard would meet a decided need in children's equipment  where light weight is imperative and hard wear unavoidable.    In addition to the garden set of shovel, rake, hoe, trowel and  wheel-barrow, a small crow-bar is useful about the yard and, in  winter, a light snow shovel is an advantage.    JEAN LEE HUNT.

SUGGESTED READING      For convenience it has seemed well to divide the following list into  two parts--the first devoted to the discussion of theory, the other  offering concrete suggestions.    Such a division is arbitrary, of course. No better exposition of  theory can be found than is contained in some of these references  dealing with actual laboratory usage and furnishings. On the other  hand the two books by Dr. Kilpatrick, with their illuminating analysis  of didactic materials, afford many concrete suggestions, at least on  the negative side.      PART I.
