[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23533"],[0,"A War-time Journal, Germany 1914 and German Travel Notes (#4)"],[1," help meet with a very chilly reception.    _August 29th._--An account has come of the battle of St. Quentin. The  \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" calls it \"decisive,\" and says that the German  army has cut off the English army from its base.    _August 30th._--Joy at last! Even the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\"  acknowledges that there has been a fight in the North Sea, and that we  have sunk German ships, but, of course, it was \"overpowering numbers  and larger ships\" that did it, and the Germans covered themselves with  glory as usual. I came home and hung out my flag, the best I could do,  a red silk dressing jacket, lined with white, and draped over a blue  silk parasol, which I tied knob out, to look like a pole.    On our church door to-day was posted a typewritten notice: \"We have  smashed your army on the French Continent,(!) and we will smash _you  too_ if you dare to ring your bell!\"    _August 31st._--I heard a small boy singing to-day:        \"Wo liegt Paris, Paris liegt Hier,      Den fingen drauf' Das nehmen Wir.\"    I pray it may not prove prophetic, but they all talk of occupying  Paris as a certainty, and the German Emperor has invited a number of  his Generals to dine with him there on the 12th of September. I hear  that a doctor went into the Prince of Wales' Hotel to-day, and saw  stuck up in the hall the words: \"Das Seegefecht in der Nordsee\" (in  which of course we were victorious). He tore it down and stamped on  it. An altruistic German waiter thinking to please the English guests  had put the first sheet of the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" in a prominent  position to console them for the many defeats we are supposed to have  had. John Burns' speech at the Albert Hall is reported in full in the  German newspapers, headed \"Eine Rede des ehemaligen Englischen  Minister, John Burns. England gegen seine wahren interessen\" (a speech  of the former English minister,[2] John Burns. England against her  true interests). No passports yet! No release! This suspense is  wearing!        [Footnote 2: This speech I have since learnt was an absolute      invention.]    _September 1st._--The sentimentality of the Germans is amazing! They  cannot even insert a simple notice of a death on the battlefield  without this sickly parade, \"Heute starb den Heldentod furs Vaterland,  unser innigste-geliebter einziger Sohn,\" etc. Always a \"hero's death\"  and \"for his Fatherland.\" A fresh \"Bekanntmachung\" has appeared, we  prisoners of war are not to leave the town, not to stand in groups  (\"rotten\" they call it) talking in the streets, to be in our houses at  9 p.m., etc. Two ex-Frankfort prisoners have been sent for by the  Chief of the Police accused of indiscreet talking. \"I hear,\" said the  great man, \"you say you were fed on nothing but bread and water in  prison.\" \"No,\" said Mr. ----, \"I had soup in the middle of the day,  and coffee and bread at night, and in the morning.\" \"Then why do you  tell lies!\" Such utter childishness, to believe every scrap of unkind  gossip!    _September 2nd._--We are buoyed up with hope, as they talk of our  getting away this week! It _will_ be delightful to leave this  perpetual bell-ringing and flag-waving and Vaterlandslieder behind us!    _September 3rd._--The whole of Altheim went mad last night,  processions, bands, marchings all night, and such a noise that at last  a nurse had to come out from the Lazarett near the Park and beg the  revellers to think of the poor wounded sick, and spare them. No one  could sleep! The last blow has come, our church is closed!    _September 4th._--Despair! The American Ambassador at Berlin has  telegraphed that we English are not to leave! The Russians are going,  but our treatment is retaliatory, because they say England is  detaining German women, and Russia lets them go. To make all worse  Fraulein S----, tired of keeping me so long for nothing, has given me  notice to quit at the moment when for three days I have had no greater  fortune than 2_d._ in my pocket. Where I am to go, or who will take me  in without money I can't imagine! The American Ambassador in Berlin  and Mr. Ives, the American Vice-Consul at Frankfort, are working  untiringly and most kindly for us. We do not complain of actual harsh  treatment, although to be turned adrift in the world without money by  one whose tenant I had been for five years is hardly kind. However,  war is war undoubtedly. Mr. Ives is from the Southern States, Mr.  H----, his Chief, from the Northern. The Scotch chauffeur has been  released after a week in prison. He looks pale and dispirited, \"a  sadder,\" and no doubt \"a wiser man.\"    _September 5th._--The \"Times\" of the 5th August has turned up in  Altheim. It has gone the round of our little community until such a  worn, creased remnant reached me, that I had much ado to keep it  together until I could master its contents. One felt a second Rip Van  Winkle, awaking after a long sleep, our world being so confined here.  At last I have discovered how to get money from England. One writes to  the American Embassy in Berlin, and encloses a telegram (with postal  order for the same) to one's banker in London, instructing him to pay  the sum of money wanted to the American Embassy in London, to be  forwarded through their kind offices to the Embassy in Berlin. The  telegram to be written on a sheet of foolscap paper, with the full  name and address of the sender, and the name also of the nearest  American Consul. No letters can be sent through this channel.    _September 6th._--No church now! Even that taken from us! The  American Vice-Consul has been here, and still thinks that we may get  away in a fortnight. We are sick with hoping and being disappointed.  The German Press full of the most virulent abuse of England,  \"treacherous,\" \"hypocritical,\" \"lying,\" \"cowardly,\" \"boastful,\" there  is no bad name they don't call her! Russia and France and Belgium get  no lashings of scorn and fury and hatred such as England does! At last  the account of Sir Edward Goschen's interviews with Von Jagow and  Bethmann Hollweg has appeared in the German papers. I had read it all  in the \"Corriere della Sera\" long ago. They talk of stopping Italian  papers in Germany since they are pro-English (in German, \"lying\").    Most of my English friends here went to the German church to-day. The  Pfarrer pointed out to his congregation how clearly God had favoured  their cause, how victory had followed victory, the virtuous, religious  people triumphing over the wicked, ungodly nations. Then he spoke of  the day so near when Germany should annihilate the \"Macht von  England,\" and teach her when crushed and humbled \"die Wahrheit,\"  Religion and Morality! Humph!    _September 7th._--Wonder of wonders! no bell-ringing to-day, nor  processions of singing youngsters, so we hope there is a lull in the  \"Sieges.\"    Miss H---- went last week to have her hair washed, and during the  process her hair-dresser remarked casually to her, \"We shall be in  Paris in a day or two, and in London in another week, and when we have  conquered England as well as France you will all have to learn to  speak German.\" This shows the amazing conceit and arrogance of the  people. Poor, ignorant things, they are quite hoodwinked by their  rulers--and even look forward to seeing their Kaiser \"Emperor of  Europe\"! One day we read that a bag has been made of 30,000 Russians,  the next that the number was understated, and that it is 70,000. As  for Belgians and French, every day 10,000 men and guns _ad lib._ are  captured, and the poor silly people believe it all. Villas and streets  are still beflagged, and by this time we know every patriotic song in  the \"Vaterlandslieder\" book by heart. One tries to be plucky, but our  hearts are very sad just now.    Paris seems doomed, and apparently the French have abandoned hope  too, since Poincare and his Cabinet have gone to Bordeaux. The German  Press call him a \"Feiger\" (Coward).    _September 9th._--Unaccountably the forward march seems to have been  checked, although we don't know why. Maubeuge has fallen, and of  course the usual bell-ringing and bunting and singing has celebrated  the victory. We cannot understand what our troops are doing. There is  no mention of them in the German papers, only columns of sneers and  abuse of England.    _September 10th._--A rumour has reached us that the Crown Prince has  been captured, and that the enemy is retreating. No official  confirmation has come to hand however; but the flags are down at last,  and the jangling of bells has ceased, and we have not heard  \"Deutschland ueber Alles\" for twenty-four hours, \"Gott sei Dank\"!  Prince Joachim is wounded, and he has sent a telegram worded after the  manner of his dear Papa, thanking God who in His goodness permitted  him to be wounded for his beloved Fatherland. I wonder what Frederick  the Great would have thought of these boastful warriors. We English  are looked upon with horror as the brutal barbarians who use dum dum  bullets, and Sir Edward Grey's dignified disclaimer is reported under  the polite heading \"Grey leugnet\" (Grey lies).    _September 11th._--Nothing new in the situation, but we rejoice to see  grave faces and groups looking solemn in the streets, and talking in  subdued voices, and thank God! we hear no bell-ringing! Everything  cheering we read in the \"Corriere della Sera\" is denied in the  \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" or given as a production of the \"Luegen Fabrik\"  (manufactory of lies).    _September 12th._--The Germans seem depressed, no flags, no bands, and  although there is a notice posted up in the town to say that the Crown  Prince has achieved another victory, there is evidently something  unsatisfactory in the background to counterbalance this. I draw  deductions from the \"Frankfurter Zeitung,\" which has a bitter article  entitled \"Torheiten\" (Folly), and which speaks of the \"Kindische  Freudengeheul\" (childish howls of joy) of the English and French  Press, because \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23545"],[0,"Songs of Childhood (#4)"],[1,"      And bleak as frost upon a too-sweet bud      His magic steals in darkness, O alas!      Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?      And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold      Hid 'neath fresh new-pluckt sprigs of eglantine?      Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,      Sad to and fro in green and secret ways,      With lonely bells the burden of his days?        And, in the market-place, what man is this      Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,      Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries      Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest      Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye      Remember a face lovely in a wood?      O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy      His woful wares; the bird of grief doth brood      There where his heart should be; and far away      Dew lies on grave-flowers this selfsame day!              THE GREY WOLF          'A fagot, a fagot, go fetch for the fire, son!'        'O, Mother, the wolf looks in at the door!'      'Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! thou fierce grey wolf fly, now;        Haste thee away, he will fright thee no more.'        'I ran, O, I ran, but the grey wolf ran faster,        O, Mother, I cry in the air at thy door,      Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! but his fangs were so cruel,        Thy son (save his hatchet) thou'lt never see more.'              THE OGRE          'Tis moonlight on Trebarwith Vale,        And moonlight on an Ogre keen,      Who prowling hungry through the dale        A lone cottage hath seen.        Small with thin smoke ascending up        Three casements and a door:--      The Ogre eager is to sup,        And here seems dainty store.        Sweet as a larder to a mouse,        So to him staring down,      Seemed the sweet-windowed moonlit house,        With jasmine overgrown.        He snorted, as the billows snort        In darkness of the night,      Betwixt his lean locks tawny-swart,        He glowered on the sight.        Into the garden sweet with peas        He put his wooden shoe,      And bending back the apple trees        Crept covetously through;        Then, stooping, with an impious eye        Stared through the lattice small,      And spied two children which did lie        Asleep, against the wall.        Into their dreams no shadow fell,        Of his disastrous thumb      Groping discreet, and gradual,        Across the quiet room.        But scarce his nail had scraped the cot        Wherein these children lay,      As if his malice were forgot,        It suddenly did stay.        For faintly in the ingle-nook        He heard a cradlesong,      That rose into his thoughts and woke        Terror them among.        For she who in the kitchen sat        Darning by the fire,      Guileless of what he would be at,        Sang sweet as wind or wire:--        'Lullay, thou little tiny child,        By-by, lullay, lullie;      Jesu of glory, meek and mild,        This night remember ye!        'Fiend, witch, and goblin, foul and wild,        He deems 'em smoke to be;      Lullay, thou little tiny child,        By-by, lullay, lullie!'        The Ogre lifted up his eyes        Into the moon's pale ray,      And gazed upon her leopard-wise,        Cruel and clear as day;        He snarled in gluttony and fear:        'The wind blows dismally,      Jesu in storm my lambs be near,        By-by, lullay, lullie!'        And like a ravenous beast which sees        The hunter's icy eye,      So did this wretch in wrath confess        Sweet Jesu's mastery.        He lightly drew his greedy thumb        From out that casement pale,      And strode, enormous, swiftly home,        Whinnying down the dale.              DAME HICKORY          'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,      Here's sticks for your fire,      Furze-twigs, and oak-twigs,      And beech-twigs, and briar!'      But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,      She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.        'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,      Here's meat for your broth,      Goose-flesh, and hare's flesh,      And pig's trotters both!'      But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,      She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.        'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,      Here's a wolf at your door,      His teeth grinning white,      And his tongue wagging sore!'      'Nay!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie!'      But a wolf 'twas indeed, and famished was he.        'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,      Here's buds for your tomb,      Bramble, and lavender,      And rosemary bloom!'      'Hush!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie,      Ye cry like a wolf, ye do, and trouble poor me.'              THE PILGRIM          'Shall we carry now your bundle,          You old grey man?        Over hill and over meadow,      Lighter than an owlet's shadow,      We will whirl it through the air,      Through blue regions shrill and bare;        Shall we carry now your bundle,          You old grey man?'        The Pilgrim lifted up his eyes      And saw three fiends, in the skies,      Stooping o'er that lonely place          Evil in form and face.        'O leave me, leave me, leave me,          Ye three wild fiends!        Far it is my feet must wander,      And my city lieth yonder;      I must bear my bundle alone,      Help nor solace suffer none:        O leave me, leave me, leave me,          Ye three wild fiends!'        The fiends stared down with greedy eye,      Fanning the chill air duskily,      'Twixt their hoods they stoop and cry:--        'Shall we smooth the path before you,          You old grey man?        Sprinkle it green with gilded showers,      Strew it o'er with painted flowers?      Shall we blow sweet airs on it,      Lure the magpie there to flit?        Shall we smooth the path before you,          You old grey man?'        'O silence, silence, silence!          Ye three wild fiends!        Over bog, and fen, and boulder,      I must bear it on my shoulder,      Beaten of wind, torn of briar,      Smitten of rain, parched of fire:        O silence, silence, silence!          Ye three wild fiends!'        It seemed a smoke obscured the air,      Bright lightning quivered in the gloom,      And a faint voice of thunder spake      Far in the lone hill-hollows--'Come!'      Then half in fury, half in dread,      The fiends drew closer down and said:--        'Grey old man but sleep awhile;          Sad old man!        Thorn, and dust, and ice, and heat;      Tarry now, sit down and eat;      Heat, and ice, and dust, and thorn;      Stricken, footsore, parched, forlorn,--      Juice of purple grape shall be      Youth and solace unto thee.        With sweet wire and reed we'll haunt you;      Songs of the valley shall enchant you;      Rest now, lest this night you die:      Sweet be now our lullaby:        'Grey old man, come sleep awhile,          Stubborn old man!'        The pilgrim crouches terrified      At stooping hood, and glassy face,      Gloating, evil, side by side;      Terror and hate brood o'er the place;      He flings his withered hands on high      With a bitter, breaking cry:--        'Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me,          Ye three wild fiends:      If I lay me down in slumber,        Then I lay me down in wrath;      If I stir not in sweet dreaming,        Then I wither in my path;      If I hear sweet voices singing,          'Tis a demon's lullaby,      And in \"hideous storm and terror\"          Wake but to die!'        And even while he spake, the sun      From the sweet hills pierced the gloom,      Kindling th' affrighted fiends upon.      Wild flapped their wings, as if in doom,      He heard a dismal hooting laughter:--        Nought but a little rain fell after,      And from the cloud whither they flew      A storm-sweet lark rose in the blue:      And his bundle seemed of flowers          In his solitary hours.              THE GAGE          'Lady Jane, O Lady Jane!      Your hound hath broken bounds again,        And chased my timorous deer, O;          If him I see,          That hour he'll dee;        My brakes shall be his bier, O.'        'Lord Aerie, Lord Aerie,      My hound, I trow, is fleet and free,        He's welcome to your deer, O;          Shoot, shoot you may,          He'll gang his way,        Your threats we nothing fear, O.'        He's fetched him in, he's fetched him in,      Gone all his swiftness, all his din,        White fang, and glowering eye, O:          'Here is your beast,          And now at least        My herds in peace shall lie, O.'        \"In peace!\" my lord, O mark me well!      For what my jolly hound befell        You shall sup twenty-fold, O!          For every tooth          Of his, i'sooth,        A stag in pawn I hold, O.        'Huntsman and horn, huntsman and horn,      Shall scare your heaths and coverts lorn,        Braying 'em shrill and clear, O;          But lone and still          Shall lift each hill,        Each valley wan and sere, O.        'Ride up you may, ride down you may,      Lonely or trooped, by night or day,        My hound shall haunt you ever:          Bird, beast, and game          Shall dread the same,        The wild fish of your river.'        Her cheek is like the angry rose,      Her eye with wrath and pity flows:        He gazes fierce and round, O,--          'Dear Lord!' he says,          'What loveliness        To waste upon a hound, O.        'I'd give my stags, my hills and dales,      My stormcocks and my nightingales        To have undone this deed, O;          For deep beneath          My heart is death        Which for her love doth bleed, O.'        Wanders he up, wanders he down,      On foot, a-horse, by night and noon:        His lands are bleak and drear, O;          Forsook his dales          Of nightingales,        Forsook his moors of deer, O.        Forsook his heart, ah me! of mirth;      There's nothing lightsome left on earth:        Only one scene is fain, O,          Where far remote          The"]]]
