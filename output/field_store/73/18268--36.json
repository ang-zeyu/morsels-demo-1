The continual  wars that in that turbulent time racked Europe gave to the marauders  of the sea a specious excuse for their occupation. Thus, many a  Spanish schooner, manned by a swarthy crew bent on plunder, commenced  her career on the Spanish Main, with the intention of taking only  ships belonging to France and England; but let a richly laden Spanish  galleon appear, after a long season of ill-fortune, and all scruples  were thrown aside, the \"Jolly Roger\" sent merrily to the fore, and  another pirate was added to the list of those that made the highways  of the sea as dangerous to travel as the footpad infested common of  Hounslow Heath. English ships went out to hunt down the treacherous  Spaniards, and stayed to rob and pillage indiscriminately; and not a  few of the names now honored as those of eminent English discoverers,  were once dreaded as being borne by merciless pirates.    But the most powerful of the buccaneers on the Spanish Main were  French, and between them and the Spaniards an unceasing warfare was  waged. There were desperate men on either side, and mighty stories are  told of their deeds of valor. There were Pierre Francois, who, with  six and twenty desperadoes, dashed into the heart of a Spanish fleet,  and captured the admiral's flag-ship; Bartholomew Portuguese, who,  with thirty men, made repeated attacks upon a great Indiaman with a  crew of seventy, and though beaten back time and again, persisted  until the crew surrendered to the twenty buccaneers left alive;  Francois l'Olonoise, who sacked the cities of Maracaibo and  Gibraltar, and who, on hearing that a man-o'-war had been sent to  drive him away, went boldly to meet her, captured her, and slaughtered  all of the crew save one, whom he sent to bear the bloody tidings to  the governor of Havana.    Such were the buccaneers,--desperate, merciless, and insatiate in  their lust for plunder. So numerous did they finally become, that no  merchant dared to send a ship to the West Indies; and the pirates,  finding that they had fairly exterminated their game, were fain to  turn landwards for further booty. It was an Englishman that showed the  sea rovers this new plan of pillage; one Louis Scott, who descended  upon the town of Campeche, and, after stripping the place to the bare  walls, demanded that a heavy tribute be paid him, in default of which  he would burn the town. Loaded with booty, he sailed back to the  buccaneers' haunts in the Tortugas. This expedition was the example  that the buccaneers followed for the next few years. City after city  fell a prey to the demoniac attacks of the lawless rovers. Houses and  churches were sacked, towns given to the flames, rich and poor  plundered alike; murder was rampant; and men and women were subjected  to the most horrid tortures, to extort information as to buried  treasures.    Two great names stand out pre-eminent amid the host of outlaws that  took part in this reign of rapine,--l'Olonoise and Sir Henry Morgan.  The desperate exploits of these two worthies would, if recounted, fill  volumes; and probably no more extraordinary narrative of cruelty,  courage, suffering, and barbaric luxury could be fabricated. Morgan  was a Welshman, an emigrant, who, having worked out as a slave the  cost of his passage across the ocean, took immediate advantage of his  freedom to take up the trade of piracy. For him was no pillaging of  paltry merchant-ships. He demanded grander operations, and his bands  of desperadoes assumed the proportions of armies. Many were the towns  that suffered from the bloody visitations of Morgan and his men.  Puerto del Principe yielded up to them three hundred thousand pieces  of eight, five hundred head of cattle, and many prisoners. Porto Bello  was bravely defended against the barbarians; and the stubbornness of  the defence so enraged Morgan, that he swore that no quarter should be  given the defenders. And so when some hours later the chief fortress  surrendered, the merciless buccaneer locked its garrison in the  guard-room, set a torch to the magazine, and sent castle and garrison  flying into the air. Maracaibo and Gibraltar next fell into the  clutches of the pirate. At the latter town, finding himself caught in  a river with three men-of-war anchored at its mouth, he hastily built  a fire-ship, put some desperate men at the helm, and sent her, a sheet  of flame, into the midst of the squadron. The admiral's ship was  destroyed; and the pirates sailed away, exulting over their  adversaries' discomfiture. Rejoicing over their victories, the  followers of Morgan then planned a venture that should eclipse all  that had gone before. This was no less than a descent upon Panama, the  most powerful of the West Indian cities. For this undertaking, Morgan  gathered around him an army of over two thousand desperadoes of all  nationalities. A little village on the island of Hispaniola was chosen  as the recruiting station; and thither flocked pirates, thieves, and  adventurers from all parts of the world. It was a motley crew thus  gathered together,--Spaniards, swarthy skinned and black haired; wiry  Frenchmen, quick to anger, and ever ready with cutlass or pistol;  Malays and Lascars, half clad in gaudy colors, treacherous and sullen,  with a hand ever on their glittering creeses; Englishmen, handy alike  with fist, bludgeon, or cutlass, and mightily given to fearful oaths;  negroes, Moors, and a few West Indians mixed with the lawless throng.    Having gathered his band, procured provisions (chiefly by plundering),  and built a fleet of boats, Morgan put his forces in motion. The first  obstacle in his path was the Castle of Chagres, which guarded the  mouth of the Chagres River, up which the buccaneers must pass to reach  the city of Panama. To capture this fortress, Morgan sent his  vice-admiral Bradley, with four hundred men. The Spaniards were  evidently warned of their approach; for hardly had the first ship  flying the piratical ensign appeared at the mouth of the river, when  the royal standard of Spain was hoisted above the castle, and the dull  report of a shotted gun told the pirates that there was a stubborn  resistance in store for them.    Landing some miles below the castle, and cutting their way with  hatchet and sabre through the densely interwoven vegetation of a  tropical jungle, the pirates at last reached a spot from which a clear  view of the castle could be obtained. As they emerged from the forest  to the open, the sight greatly disheartened them. They saw a powerful  fort, with bastions, moat, drawbridge, and precipitous natural  defences. Many of the pirates advised a retreat; but Bradley,  dreading the anger of Morgan, ordered an assault. Time after time did  the desperate buccaneers, with horrid yells, rush upon the fort, only  to be beaten back by the well-directed volleys of the garrison. They  charged up to the very walls, threw over fireballs, and hacked the  timbers with axes, but to no avail. From behind their impregnable  ramparts, the Spaniards fired murderous volleys, crying out.--    \"Come on, you English devils, you heretics, the enemies of God and of  the king! Let your comrades who are behind come also. We will serve  them as we have served you. You shall not get to Panama this time.\"    As night fell, the pirates withdrew into the thickets to escape the  fire of their enemies, and to discuss their discomfiture. As one group  of buccaneers lay in the jungle, a chance arrow, shot by an Indian in  the fort, struck one of them in the arm. Springing to his feet with a  cry of rage and pain, the wounded man cried out as he tore the arrow  from the bleeding wound,--    \"Look here, my comrades. I will make this accursed arrow the means of  the destruction of all the Spaniards.\"    So saying, he wrapped a quantity of cotton about the head of the  arrow, charged his gun with powder, and, thrusting the arrow into the  muzzle, fired. His comrades eagerly watched the flight of the missile,  which was easily traced by the flaming cotton. Hurtling through the  air, the fiery missile fell upon a thatched roof within the castle,  and the dry straw and leaves were instantly in a blaze. With cries of  savage joy, the buccaneers ran about picking up the arrows that lay  scattered over the battle-field. Soon the air was full of the  fire-brands, and the woodwork within the castle enclosure was a mass  of flame. One arrow fell within the magazine; and a burst of smoke and  flame, and the dull roar of an explosion, followed. The Spaniards  worked valiantly to extinguish the flames, and to beat back their  assailants; but the fire raged beyond their control, and the bright  light made them easy targets for their foes. There could be but one  issue to such a conflict. By morning the fort was in the hands of the  buccaneers, and of the garrison of three hundred and fourteen only  fourteen were unhurt. Over the ruins of the fort the English flag was  hoisted, the shattered walls were repaired, and the place made a  rendezvous for Morgan's forces.    On the scene of the battle Morgan drilled his forces, and prepared for  the march and battles that were to come. After some days' preparation,  the expedition set out. The road lay through tangled tropical forests,  under a burning sun. Little food was taken, as the invaders expected  to live on the country; but the inhabitants fled before the advancing  column, destroying every thing eatable. Soon starvation stared the  desperadoes in the face. They fed upon berries, roots, and leaves. As  the days passed, and no food was to be found, they sliced up and  devoured coarse leather bags. For a time, it seemed that they would  never escape alive from the jungle; but at last, weak, weary, and  emaciated, they came out upon a grassy plain before the city of  Panama. Here, a few days later, a great battle was fought. The  Spaniards outnumbered the invaders, and were better provided with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2232"],[0,"The Duchess of Malfi (#4)"],[1," we may imitate the loving palms,    Best emblem of a peaceful marriage,    That never bore fruit, divided!

How can the church build faster?[28]    We now are man and wife, and 'tis the church    That must but echo this.--Maid, stand apart:    I now am blind.      ANTONIO.         What 's your conceit in this?      DUCHESS.

Whether the spirit of greatness or of woman    Reign most in her, I know not; but it shows    A fearful madness.  I owe her much of pity.

'Tis the very main[31] of my ambition.      BOSOLA.  Let me see:  you have a reasonable good face for 't already,    and your night-cap expresses your ears sufficient largely.  I would    have you learn to twirl the strings of your band with a good grace,    and in a set speech, at th' end of every sentence, to hum three    or four times, or blow your nose till it smart again, to recover your    memory.  When you come to be a president in criminal causes, if you    smile upon a prisoner, hang him; but if you frown upon him and    threaten him, let him be sure to scape the gallows.      CASTRUCCIO.  I would be a very merry president.      BOSOLA.  Do not sup o' nights; 'twill beget you an admirable wit.      CASTRUCCIO.  Rather it would make me have a good stomach to quarrel;    for they say, your roaring boys eat meat seldom, and that makes them    so valiant.  But how shall I know whether the people take me for    an eminent fellow?      BOSOLA.  I will teach a trick to know it:  give out you lie a-dying,    and if you hear the common people curse you, be sure you are taken    for one of the prime night-caps.[32]         [Enter an Old Lady]    You come from painting now.      OLD LADY.  From what?      BOSOLA.  Why, from your scurvy face-physic.  To behold thee not    painted inclines somewhat near a miracle.  These in thy face here    were deep ruts and foul sloughs the last progress.[33] There was    a lady in France that, having had the small-pox, flayed the skin off    her face to make it more level; and whereas before she looked    like a nutmeg-grater, after she resembled an abortive hedge-hog.      OLD LADY.  Do you call this painting?      BOSOLA.  No, no, but you call [it] careening[34] of an old    morphewed[35] lady, to make her disembogue[36] again:    there 's rough-cast phrase to your plastic.[37]      OLD LADY.  It seems you are well acquainted with my closet.      BOSOLA.  One would suspect it for a shop of witchcraft, to find in it    the fat of serpents, spawn of snakes, Jews' spittle, and their young    children's ordure; and all these for the face.  I would sooner eat    a dead pigeon taken from the soles of the feet of one sick of the    plague, than kiss one of you fasting.  Here are two of you, whose sin    of your youth is the very patrimony of the physician; makes him renew    his foot-cloth with the spring, and change his high-pric'd courtezan    with the fall of the leaf.  I do wonder you do not loathe yourselves.    Observe my meditation now.    What thing is in this outward form of man    To be belov'd?  We account it ominous,    If nature do produce a colt, or lamb,    A fawn, or goat, in any limb resembling    A man, and fly from 't as a prodigy:    Man stands amaz'd to see his deformity    In any other creature but himself.    But in our own flesh though we bear diseases    Which have their true names only ta'en from beasts,--    As the most ulcerous wolf and swinish measle,--    Though we are eaten up of lice and worms,    And though continually we bear about us    A rotten and dead body, we delight    To hide it in rich tissue:  all our fear,    Nay, all our terror, is, lest our physician    Should put us in the ground to be made sweet.--    Your wife 's gone to Rome:  you two couple, and get you to    the wells at Lucca to recover your aches.  I have other work on foot.         [Exeunt CASTRUCCIO and Old Lady]    I observe our duchess    Is sick a-days, she pukes, her stomach seethes,    The fins of her eye-lids look most teeming blue,[38]    She wanes i' the cheek, and waxes fat i' the flank,    And, contrary to our Italian fashion,    Wears a loose-bodied gown:  there 's somewhat in 't.    I have a trick may chance discover it,    A pretty one; I have bought some apricocks,    The first our spring yields.           [Enter ANTONIO and DELIO, talking together apart]      DELIO.                        And so long since married?    You amaze me.      ANTONIO.       Let me seal your lips for ever:    For, did I think that anything but th' air    Could carry these words from you, I should wish    You had no breath at all.--Now, sir, in your contemplation?    You are studying to become a great wise fellow.      BOSOLA.  O, sir, the opinion of wisdom is a foul tetter[39]    that runs all over a man's body:  if simplicity direct us to have    no evil, it directs us to a happy being; for the subtlest folly    proceeds from the subtlest wisdom:  let me be simply honest.      ANTONIO.  I do understand your inside.      BOSOLA.                                 Do you so?      ANTONIO.  Because you would not seem to appear to th' world    Puff'd up with your preferment, you continue    This out-of-fashion melancholy:  leave it, leave it.      BOSOLA.  Give me leave to be honest in any phrase, in any compliment    whatsoever.  Shall I confess myself to you?  I look no higher than    I can reach:  they are the gods that must ride on winged horses.    A lawyer's mule of a slow pace will both suit my disposition and    business; for, mark me, when a man's mind rides faster than his horse    can gallop, they quickly both tire.      ANTONIO.  You would look up to heaven, but I think    The devil, that rules i' th' air, stands in your light.      BOSOLA.  O, sir, you are lord of the ascendant,[40] chief man with    the duchess:  a duke was your cousin-german remov'd.  Say you were    lineally descended from King Pepin, or he himself, what of this?    Search the heads of the greatest rivers in the world, you shall find    them but bubbles of water.  Some would think the souls of princes    were brought forth by some more weighty cause than those of meaner    persons:  they are deceiv'd, there 's the same hand to them; the like    passions sway them; the same reason that makes a vicar go to law for    a tithe-pig, and undo his neighbours, makes them spoil a whole    province, and batter down goodly cities with the cannon.           [Enter DUCHESS and Ladies]      DUCHESS.  Your arm, Antonio:  do I not grow fat?    I am exceeding short-winded.--Bosola,    I would have you, sir, provide for me a litter;    Such a one as the Duchess of Florence rode in.      BOSOLA.  The duchess us'd one when she was great with child.      DUCHESS.  I think she did.--Come hither, mend my ruff:    Here, when? thou art such a tedious lady; and    Thy breath smells of lemon-pills:  would thou hadst done!    Shall I swoon under thy fingers?  I am    So troubled with the mother![41]      BOSOLA.  [Aside.]             I fear too much.      DUCHESS.  I have heard you say that the French courtiers    Wear their hats on 'fore that king.      ANTONIO.  I have seen it.      DUCHESS.                   In the presence?      ANTONIO.                                     Yes.      DUCHESS.  Why should not we bring up that fashion?    'Tis ceremony more than duty that consists    In the removing of a piece of felt.    Be you the example to the rest o' th' court;    Put on your hat first.      ANTONIO.                You must pardon me:    I have seen, in colder countries than in France,    Nobles stand bare to th' prince; and the distinction    Methought show'd reverently.      BOSOLA.  I have a present for your grace.      DUCHESS.                                   For me, sir?      BOSOLA.  Apricocks, madam.      DUCHESS.                    O, sir, where are they?    I have heard of none to-year[42]      BOSOLA.  [Aside.]              Good; her colour rises.      DUCHESS.  Indeed, I thank you:  they are wondrous fair ones.    What an unskilful fellow is our gardener!    We shall have none this month.      BOSOLA.  Will not your grace pare them?      DUCHESS.  No:  they taste of musk, methinks; indeed they do.      BOSOLA.  I know not:  yet I wish your grace had par'd 'em.      DUCHESS.  Why?      BOSOLA.         I forgot to tell you, the knave gardener,    Only to raise his profit by them the sooner,    Did ripen them in horse-dung.      DUCHESS.                       O, you jest.--    You shall judge:  pray, taste one.      ANTONIO.                            Indeed, madam,    I do not love the fruit.      DUCHESS.                  Sir, you are loth    To rob us of our dainties.  'Tis a delicate fruit;    They say they are restorative.      BOSOLA.                        'Tis a pretty art,    This grafting.      DUCHESS.  'Tis so; a bettering of nature.      BOSOLA.  To make a pippin grow upon a crab,    A damson on a black-thorn.--[Aside.] How greedily she eats them!
