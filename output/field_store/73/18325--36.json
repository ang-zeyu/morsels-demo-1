About twelve o'clock we heard the terrible news.  Oh, Mr.  Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour!  It was so much to  him.\"    Holmes shook his head sadly.    \"Come, Watson,\" said he, \"our ways lie elsewhere.  Our next station  must be the office from which the papers were taken.    \"It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries  make it blacker,\" he remarked as the cab lumbered off. \"His coming  marriage gives a motive for the crime.  He naturally wanted money.  The  idea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl  an accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans.  It is all very  bad.\"    \"But surely, Holmes, character goes for something?  Then, again, why  should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a  felony?\"    \"Exactly!  There are certainly objections.  But it is a formidable case  which they have to meet.\"    Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received  us with that respect which my companion's card always commanded.  He  was a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard,  and his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been  subjected.    \"It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad!  Have you heard of the death of the  chief?\"    \"We have just come from his house.\"    \"The place is disorganized.  The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our  papers stolen.  And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we  were as efficient an office as any in the government service.  Good  God, it's dreadful to think of!  That West, of all men, should have  done such a thing!\"    \"You are sure of his guilt, then?\"    \"I can see no other way out of it.  And yet I would have trusted him as  I trust myself.\"    \"At what hour was the office closed on Monday?\"    \"At five.\"    \"Did you close it?\"    \"I am always the last man out.\"    \"Where were the plans?\"    \"In that safe.  I put them there myself.\"    \"Is there no watchman to the building?\"    \"There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an  old soldier and a most trustworthy man.  He saw nothing that evening.  Of course the fog was very thick.\"    \"Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building  after hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could  reach the papers?\"    \"Yes, he would.  The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and  the key of the safe.\"    \"Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?\"    \"I had no keys of the doors--only of the safe.\"    \"Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?\"    \"Yes, I think he was.  I know that so far as those three keys are  concerned he kept them on the same ring.  I have often seen them there.\"    \"And that ring went with him to London?\"    \"He said so.\"    \"And your key never left your possession?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate.  And yet  none was found upon his body.  One other point:  if a clerk in this  office desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the  plans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?\"    \"It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an  effective way.\"    \"But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical  knowledge?\"    \"No doubt we had, but I beg you won't try to drag me into the matter,  Mr. Holmes.  What is the use of our speculating in this way when the  original plans were actually found on West?\"    \"Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking  originals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have  equally served his turn.\"    \"Singular, no doubt--and yet he did so.\"    \"Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable.  Now there  are three papers still missing.  They are, as I understand, the vital  ones.\"    \"Yes, that is so.\"    \"Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without  the seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?\"    \"I reported to that effect to the Admiralty.  But to-day I have been  over the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it.  The double valves  with the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers  which have been returned.  Until the foreigners had invented that for  themselves they could not make the boat.  Of course they might soon get  over the difficulty.\"    \"But the three missing drawings are the most important?\"    \"Undoubtedly.\"    \"I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the  premises.  I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.\"    He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the  iron shutters of the window.  It was only when we were on the lawn  outside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush  outside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having  been twisted or snapped.  He examined them carefully with his lens, and  then some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath.  Finally he asked  the chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me  that they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for  anyone outside to see what was going on within the room.    \"The indications are ruined by three days' delay.  They may mean  something or nothing.  Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can  help us further.  It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see  if we can do better in London.\"    Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich  Station.  The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with  confidence that he saw Cadogan West--whom he knew well by sight--upon  the Monday night, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London  Bridge.  He was alone and took a single third-class ticket.  The clerk  was struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner.  So shaky was  he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped  him with it.  A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the  first train which it was possible for West to take after he had left  the lady about 7:30.    \"Let us reconstruct, Watson,\" said Holmes after half an hour of  silence.  \"I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever  had a case which was more difficult to get at.  Every fresh advance  which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely  made some appreciable progress.    \"The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against  young Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend  themselves to a more favourable hypothesis.  Let us suppose, for  example, that he had been approached by some foreign agent.  It might  have been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from  speaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the  direction indicated by his remarks to his fiancee.  Very good.  We will  now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he  suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the  direction of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his  decisions.  Everything gave way to his duty.  He followed the man,  reached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued  the thief.  In this way we get over the objection that no one would  take originals when he could make copies.  This outsider had to take  originals. So far it holds together.\"    \"What is the next step?\"    \"Then we come into difficulties.  One would imagine that under such  circumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the  villain and raise the alarm.  Why did he not do so? Could it have been  an official superior who took the papers? That would explain West's  conduct.  Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and  West started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms,  presuming that he knew where the rooms were?  The call must have been  very pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no  effort to communicate with her.  Our scent runs cold here, and there is  a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West's body,  with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train.  My instinct now is to work from the other end.  If Mycroft has given us  the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two  tracks instead of one.\"    Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street.  A government  messenger had brought it post-haste.  Holmes glanced at it and threw it  over to me.    There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an  affair.  The only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13 Great  George Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions,  Notting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington.  The latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as  having left.  Glad to hear you have seen some light.  The Cabinet  awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety.  Urgent  representations have arrived from the very highest quarter.  The whole  force of the State is at your back if you should need it.    Mycroft.    \"I'm afraid,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"that all the queen's horses and  all the queen's men cannot avail in this matter.\"  He had spread out  his big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. \"Well, well,\" said he  presently with an exclamation of satisfaction, \"things are turning a  little in our direction at last.  Why, Watson, I do honestly believe  that we are going to pull it off, after all.\"  He slapped me on the  shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity.  \"I am going out now.  It is  only a reconnaissance.  I will do nothing serious without my trusted  comrade and biographer at my elbow.  Do you stay here, and the odds are  that you will see me again in an hour or two.  If time hangs heavy get  foolscap and a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23462"],[0,"More Russian Picture Tales (#4)"],[1,"ox, all made of straw and  smeared over with pitch.\" Then the wolf said: \"Well, if that's so, give  me some pitch to put on my poor torn side.\" And the ox answered: \"By all  means!\" So the wolf tried to take some pitch, when lo and behold! his  paw stuck in it. And when he tried to free it, it stuck all the faster.  And the old woman woke up and saw the wolf sticking to the ox. So she  ran to fetch her husband and said: \"Come as quick as you can, there's a  wolf stuck to the ox!\" And he came and caught the wolf and put him in  the cellar.    [Illustration]    The next day, before even the sun had risen, the old woman again drove  the ox to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began  spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green  grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!\" And she went on  spinning and spinning, and fell asleep.    [Illustration]    Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a fox  came running, and ran right up against the ox. \"What sort of a beast  are you?\" he asked. And the ox answered: \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all  made of straw and smeared over with pitch.\" Then the fox said: \"Well  then, give me some pitch to rub on my side.\" And the fox was just going  to take some pitch, when he stuck fast and couldn't free himself. And  the old woman woke up and saw the fox sticking to the ox. So she ran to  fetch her husband, and he came and took the fox and put him in the  cellar as well.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The next day the old woman again sat down under the tree to spin her  flax while the ox fed, and she began spinning and saying to herself:  \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh  green grass!\" And she went on spinning and spinning and fell asleep.  Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a grey  hare came running and ran right up against the ox. \"What sort of beast  are you?\" he asked. \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and  smeared over with pitch.\" Then the hare said: \"Well then, give me some  pitch to rub on my side.\" \"Take some!\" answered the ox. And the hare  caught hold of him with his teeth, when lo and behold! his teeth stuck  fast. He tore and tore, but couldn't tear them free. And the old woman  woke up, and ran to fetch her husband, and said: \"Come as quick as you  can, there's a hare stuck to the ox!\" And the old man came, took the  hare and flung him into the cellar. Then the old man began to grind his  knife, and the bear heard him and asked: \"What are you grinding your  knife for?\" And he answered: \"I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off  your back and make myself a fur coat out of it.\" But the bear said: \"Oh!  don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay  you handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you do!\" answered the old man, and so he  let the bear go free, and he ran off into the forest.    [Illustration]    The next day the old man again began to grind his knife outside the  cellar, and the wolf asked him: \"What are you grinding your knife for?\"  And he answered: \"I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back  and make myself a fur coat out of it.\" But the wolf said: \"Oh! don't  take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you  handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you do!\" answered the old man, and so he let  the wolf too go free. And again he began to grind his knife outside the  cellar, and the fox asked him: \"What are you grinding your knife for?\"  And he answered: \"I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back,  and make myself out of it a collar for my fur coat.\" But the fox said:  \"Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll  repay you handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you do!\" answered he.    [Illustration]    Then the hare was left all alone.    And again the old man began to grind his knife, and the hare asked him:  \"What are you grinding your knife for?\" And he answered: \"I'm grinding  my knife to take the skin off your back, and make myself some fur gloves  out of it.\" But the hare said: \"Oh! don't take the skin off my back!  Better let me go free, and I'll repay you handsomely.\" \"Well, mind you  do!\" he answered, and let the hare too go free.    [Illustration]    Early the next morning the old man heard someone knocking at the gate,  so he asked: \"Who's there?\" And the answer came: \"It's I, the bear, come  to pay you my debt.\" And the old man opened the gate, and there was the  bear with a hive of honey he had brought. So the old man took the honey,  when again he heard knock-knock at the gate! \"Who's there?\" he asked,  and the answer came: \"It's I, the wolf, come to pay you my debt.\" And  there was the wolf with a whole flock of sheep he had driven up. So the  old man let the sheep into the yard, when again he heard knock-knock at  the gate. \"Who's there?\" he asked, and the answer came: \"It's I, the  fox, come to pay you my debt.\" And there was the fox with a whole  farm-yardful of cocks and hens, and ducks and geese. Suddenly there came  another knock-knock at the gate. \"Who's there?\" asked the old man, and  the answer came: \"It's I, the hare, come to pay you my debt.\" And he had  brought with him a whole heap of cabbages. And the old man and his wife  began to live happily together, and always spoke well and kindly of  those beasts.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE FOX AND THE BLACKBIRD.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      A fox was walking through the forest when he fell into a deep hole. And  there he sat and sat, till all at once he began to feel hungry. He  started looking round, but could see nothing. Then he looked up, and  there he saw a blackbird in the tree above weaving its nest, and he  said: \"Mr. Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, what are you doing?\" And the  blackbird answered: \"I'm weaving my nest.\" \"What are you weaving your  nest for?\" asked the fox. \"To bring up my children in,\" answered the  blackbird. \"But I'm going to eat your children,\" said the fox. \"Don't  eat my children,\" answered the blackbird. \"Well then, feed me, I'm  hungry,\" said the fox. At that the blackbird began to fret and to worry:  how should he feed the fox? Then he flew off into the village, and  brought back a chicken for the fox.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And the fox ate the chicken, and after a little he said: \"Mr. Blackbird,  Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?\" And the blackbird answered:  \"Yes.\" \"Well then,\" said the fox, \"give me a drink!\" At that the  blackbird began to fret and to worry: how was he to get the fox a  drink? Then he flew off into the village, and brought back a little  pailful of water for the fox.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And the fox had a good drink, and after a little he said: \"Mr.  Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?\" And the blackbird  answered: \"Yes.\" \"And you got me a drink?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well then,\" said the  fox, \"come and pull me out of the hole!\" At that the blackbird began to  fret and to worry: how could he pull the fox out of the hole? Then he  began to gather sticks in the forest and started throwing them into the  hole. And he kept throwing them in and throwing them in, till he filled  the hole. And the fox climbed up on to the sticks and out of the hole.  And when he had climbed out, he lay down right under the tree. And there  he lay and lay, and he said to the blackbird: \"Look here, you fed me,  didn't you, Mr. Blackbird?\" And the blackbird answered. \"Yes.\" \"And you  got me a drink?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you pulled me out of the hole?\" \"Yes.\"  \"Well then,\" said the fox, \"now make me laugh!\" At that the blackbird  began to fret and to worry: how should he make the fox laugh? At last he  said: \"Very well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll fly into the village,  and you run after me.\" So they agreed to do that, and the blackbird flew  off into the village and perched on the gate of a rich peasant's house,  while the fox lay down under the gateway. Then the blackbird began to  sing: \"Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat! Mistress, Mistress,  bring a lump of fat!\" And the fox said: \"That's fine, let's have it  again!\" So the blackbird began once more: \"Mistress, Mistress, bring a  lump of fat! Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat!\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Suddenly from under the gate a dog said angrily: \"Wow-wow!\" and the fox  took to his heels and hopped it into the forest as quick as he could!    [Illustration]    And that's all about it.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Work is just as good as leisure, when we want to give  pleasure.]"]]]
