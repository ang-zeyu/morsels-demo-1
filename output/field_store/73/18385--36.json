Oglethorpe, after  posting his sentinels, slept on the ground under the shelter of the  tall pines, near the central watch fire. As a soldier should, he slept  soundly. He had planted the new Colony, and thus far all had gone well  with him and with those whose interests he had charge of.    To bring these colonists across the ocean, and place them in a position  where they might begin life anew, was not a very difficult undertaking;  but to plant a colony amongst savages already suspicious of the whites,  and to succeed in obtaining their respect, friendship, and aid, was  something that required wisdom, courage, prudence, and large experience.  This Oglethorpe did; and it is to his credit, that, during the time he  had charge of the Colony, he never in any shape or form took advantage  of the ignorance of the Indians. His method of dealing with them was  very simple. He conciliated them by showing them that the whites could  be just, fair, and honorable in their dealings; and thus, in the very  beginning, he won the friendship of those whose enmity to the little  Colony would have proved ruinous.    Providence favored Oglethorpe in this matter. He had to deal with an  Indian chief full of years, wisdom, and experience. This was Tomochichi,  who was at the head of the Yamacraws. From this kindly Indian the  Georgia Colony received untold benefits. He remained the steadfast  friend of the settlers, and used his influence in their behalf in every  possible way, and on all occasions. Although he was a very old man,  he was strong and active, and of commanding presence. He possessed  remarkable intelligence; and this, added to his experience, made him one  of the most remarkable of the Indians whose names have been preserved  in history. There was something of a mystery about him that adds to the  interest which his active friendship for the whites has given to his  name. He belonged to the tribe of Lower Creeks; but for some reason or  other, he, with a number of his tribemen, had been banished. The cause  of his exile has never been made known; but at this late day it may be  guessed that he became disgusted with the factional disputes among the  Creeks, and sought in another part of the territory the peace and repose  to which his years of service had entitled him; and that when he had  taken this step, the factions which he had opposed succeeded in having  him banished. Some such theory as this is necessary to account for the  tributes that were paid to his character and influence by the Creek  chiefs who assembled at Savannah to make a treaty with Oglethorpe.  Tomochichi was ninety-one years old when the Georgia Colony was founded,  and he had gathered about him a number of disaffected Creeks and  Yemassees, known as the tribe of the Yamacraws. When the Creeks came to  Savannah to meet Oglethorpe, the greatest of their chiefs said that  he was related to Tomochichi, who was a good man, and had been a great  warrior.    Thus, with Oglethorpe to direct it, and with Tomochichi as its friend,  the little Georgia Colony was founded, and, as we shall see, thrived and  flourished.          THE EMPRESS OF GEORGIA    When Oglethorpe landed at Yamacraw Bluff, he was greatly aided in  his efforts to conciliate the Indians by the wife of John Musgrove, a  half-breed woman whose Indian name was Coosaponakesee. She was known by  the colonists as Mary Musgrove, and her friendship for the whites was  timely and fortunate. She was Oglethorpe's interpreter in his first  interview with Tomochichi. She was very friendly and accommodating,  giving aid to Oglethorpe and his colony in every possible way. Finding  that she had great influence, and could be made very useful to the  colonists, Oglethorpe employed her as interpreter, and paid her yearly  one hundred pounds sterling, which in that day was equal to a great deal  more than five hundred dollars; but Mary Musgrove earned all that was  paid her, and more. She used all her influence in behalf of the whites.  She aided in concluding treaties, and also in securing warriors from  the Creek nation in the war that occurred between the colonists and the  Spaniards who occupied Florida.    General Oglethorpe had a sincere friendship for Mary Musgrove, and his  influence over her was such that she never refused a request he made.  If Oglethorpe had remained in Georgia, it is probable that the curious  episode in which Mary took a leading part would never have occurred.    Oglethorpe left Georgia on the 23d of July, 1743, and never returned.  John Musgrove died shortly afterwards, and Mary married a man named  Matthews, who also died. She then married a man named Thomas Bosomworth,  who had been chaplain to Oglethorpe's regiment. In 1743, before  Oglethorpe's departure, Bosomworth had been commissioned to perform all  religious and ecclesiastical affairs in Georgia. Previous to that he had  accepted a grant of lands, and had taken up his abode in the Colony. He  appears to have been a pompous and an ambitious person, with just enough  learning to make him dangerous.    Before Mary Musgrove married Bosomworth she had never ceased to labor  for the good of the Colony. No sacrifice was too great for her to make  in behalf of her white friends. It is true, she had not been fully  paid for her services; but she had faith in the good intentions of  the government, and was content. In 1744, a year after Oglethorpe's  departure from the Colony, Mary married Bosomworth, and after that her  conduct was such as to keep the whites in constant fear of massacre and  extermination.    In 1745, Thomas Bosomworth went to England and informed the trustees  of the Georgia Company that he intended to give up his residence in the  Georgia Colony. The next year he returned to Georgia, and violated  the regulations of the trustees by introducing six negro slaves on the  plantation of his wife near the Altamaha River. This action was at once  resented; and President Stephens, who had succeeded Oglethorpe in the  management of the Colony's affairs, was ordered to have the negro slaves  removed from the territory of Georgia. This was done, and from that time  forth Bosomworth and his wife began to plot against the peace and  good order of the Georgia Colony. He used the influence of his wife to  conciliate the Indians, and secure their sympathy and support. While  this was going on, he was busy in preparing a claim against the  government of the Colony for the services rendered and losses sustained  by his wife, which he valued at five hundred pounds sterling. In  her name he also claimed possession of the islands of Ossabaw, St.  Catharine, and Sapelo, and of a tract of land near Savannah which in  former treaties had been reserved to the Indians.    Bosomworth was shrewd enough not to act alone. In some mysterious way,  not clearly told in history, he secured the sympathy and support of  Major William Horton, commander of Oglethorpe's regiment stationed at  Frederica, and other officers. Colonel Heron, who succeeded Major Horton  as commander of the regiment in 1747, was likewise gained over to the  cause of the Bosomworths. By the connivance of this officer, a body  of Indians, with Malatche at their head, marched to Frederica for a  conference. At this conference Malatche made a speech in which he told  of the services which his sister Mary had rendered the colonists, and  requested that a messenger be sent to England to tell the King that he,  Malatche, was emperor of all the Creeks. He declared, also, that Mary,  his sister, was confided in by the whole Creek nation, and that the  nation had decided to abide by her will and desire.    Bosomworth saw the necessity of pushing the matter forward, and so  he suggested to Malatche the importance of having himself crowned as  emperor by those who were with him. Accordingly a paper was drawn up  giving to Malatche full authority as emperor. This done, Bosomworth was  quick to procure from the Creek emperor a deed of conveyance to  Thomas and Mary Bosomworth of the islands of Ossabaw, Sapelo, and St.  Catharine.    Matters went on peaceably for a while; but Bosomworth was active and  energetic, and his wife appears to have been entirely under his control.  He bought on credit a great number of cattle from planters in South  Carolina, and these he placed on the islands that had been given him  by Malatche. When his debts fell due, he was unable to pay them. Rather  than surrender the property for which he was unable to pay, he suggested  to his wife that she take the title of an independent empress. It is  doubtful if she knew what an empress was; but she had an idea, that, if  she claimed to be one, she would be able to buy some red calico at the  nearest store, as well as an extra bottle of rum. So she fell eagerly  into the Rev. Mr. Bosom-worth's plans. She sent word to the Creeks that  she had suddenly become a genuine empress, and called a meeting of the  big men of the nation. The big men assembled; and Mary made a speech,  in which she insisted that she was the Empress of Georgia. She must have  been a pretty good talker; for the Indians became very much excited, and  pledged themselves to stand by her to the last drop of their blood.    Having thus obtained the support of the Indians, Mary set out for  Savannah, accompanied by a large body of them. She sent before her a  messenger to inform the president of the Province that she had become  empress over the whole territory belonging to the Upper and Lower  Creeks; that she was on her way to demand the instant surrender of all  the lands that had belonged to Doth nations; and that, if there should  be any serious opposition to her demands, the settlement would be  attacked and destroyed.
