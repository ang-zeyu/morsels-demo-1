[Illustration: Detail of Writing Desk]    Begin work by cutting the posts to length and shape. Having done this,  lay out the tenons on the lower rails so as to have the required  distances between the shoulders, and then cut them. Now cut the parts  to be worked into the frames that support the drawer and bottom of the  case, and glue them properly. While this is drying, the other parts of  the case may be laid out and shaped. It is intended that the sides of  the case shall splice on the edge of the bottom of the pigeon hole case.  In this manner the side shelves will cover the joint on either end. The  back may be made up into one solid piece. Make the side pieces of the  case long enough to be housed into the posts about 3/8 in. at each end.    [Illustration: Writing Desk Complete]    The shelves at the ends of the desk should be fastened after the frame  is put together and before the bottom of the case for the pigeon holes  is fitted and fastened. In so doing the shelves may be fastened from the  inside of the case. The angles of the braces are 30-60 deg. It will be  noted that the edges of the lid are rabbeted. Another way is to have the  lid large enough to fit entirely over the sides of the case and change  the slope to correspond.    The drawers may be made next. The fronts should be of oak, but the other  parts of yellow poplar. An examination of an ordinary drawer will show  the manner of construction.    Make the frame of the pigeon holes of 3/16-in. yellow poplar. The  drawing shows an arrangement entirely independent of the sides of the  desk so that the frame can be made and slipped in place after the finish  has been put on. Two drawers are shown. These are faced front and back  alike so as to secure as much room in the drawer as possible.    In the finishing, the poplar wood should be finished with white shellac  in the natural light color of the wood. For the oak parts the following  is appropriate for this design: Apply one coat of green Flemish water  stain. When this has dried, sandpaper lightly until the raised grain has  been removed, and apply another coat of stain diluted one-half with  water. When dry, sand lightly and apply a very thin coat of shellac.  Sand lightly and apply a coat of dark filler, natural filler colored  with lamp-black, according to the somberness of the finish desired. Upon  this put a coat of orange shellac. After this, put on two coats of a  good rubbing varnish. Rub the first coats with curled hair or haircloth  and the last with pulverized pumice stone and raw linseed oil or crude  oil.          AN OAK COUCH WITH CUSHIONS      This beautiful piece of mission furniture can be made at a very moderate  cost, if the material used for the cushions is of good imitation  leather. These substitutes for leather last fully as long and the  difference can only be detected by an expert. White oak will give the  best results except for the frames or slats on which the cushions rest  and these may be made of poplar or pine. If a mill or woodworking shop  of any kind is handy, the hardest part of the work can be saved by  securing the following list of material, cut, planed, sanded and squared  up to the exact sizes given:      2 posts, 3 in. square by 17 in.    2 posts, 3 in. square by 26 in.    2 rails, 7/8 by 8 by 82 in.    1 rail, 7/8 by 8 by 25 in.    1 end, 7/8 by 18 by 25 in.    1 piece, 7/8 by 9 by 24-1/2 in.    The last piece on the list when sawed diagonal makes the two slanting  pieces at the head of the couch. The corner braces are made from two  pieces of straight-grained oak, 2 by 4-1/2 by 4-1/2 in., sawed on the  diagonal, and cut as shown in the enlarged plan section to make the four  pieces.    First be sure the legs are perfectly square, the two short ones and the  two long ones of equal length respectively. Either chamfer or round the  upper ends as desired, chisel and plane the taper on the lower ends. Lay  out and cut all the tenons on the rails--1 in. is the amount allowed at  each end in the stock dimensions given. Arrange the posts and rails in  the positions they are to occupy in the finished couch. Number each  tenon and the place its corresponding mortise is to be cut in the post.  Mark each mortise directly from the tenon which is to fit into it,  taking care to have all the rails an equal distance from the floor. Bore  and chisel out all mortises and see that all the rails fit perfectly,  before proceeding with the work.    [Illustration: Couch Complete]    The next step will be to fit in the slanting side pieces at the head of  the couch. These must be let into the long posts 1/2 in. and held also  by a dowel in the side rail. In order to get these pieces into place,  the mortise in the long post must be made 1/2 in. longer than the tenon  on the sloping side piece so the tenon may be first pushed into the  mortise and then the side clamped down on the rail over the dowel. The  whole couch should fit together perfectly before gluing any of the  parts.    Glue the end parts together first. Hot glue will hold best if the room  and lumber are warm; if these cannot be had, use cold glue. After the  ends have set for at least 24 hours, glue in place the side rails and  slanting head pieces. Screw in place the corner braces. Be sure when  making these braces to have the grain running diagonally across the  corner, or the brace will be weak, also, be sure the sides are square  with the ends; this may be determined by measuring the diagonals to find  if they are equal.    If it is decided to use frames for the cushions, then the following  material will be necessary:      2 pieces, 7/8 by 2 by 56 in.    2 pieces, 7/8 by 2 by 25 in.    4 pieces 7/8 by 2 by 21 in.    This material may be of pine or poplar. These pieces are made into two  frames as shown in the drawing and held together with long screws or  nails. Fasten with glue and screw short blocks on the inside of the  couch rails for holding the two frames in place. Tack pieces of cheap  burlap across the frame and cover with ordinary black cambric. This will  give a strong, springy rest for the cushions.    Should slats be used instead of frames for holding the cushions, then  the following list of material should be substituted for the frame  material list:      2 cleats, 7/8 by 2 by 56 in.    2 cleats, 7/8 by 2 by 25 in.    12 slats, 3/4 by 5 by 25 in.    [Illustration: Details of Mission Couch]    The materials listed may be of soft wood the same as for the frame. The  cleats are fastened to the inside of the rails of the couch with  screws, so the top edge will be 2 in. lower than the top edge of the  rails. The slats are spaced evenly on these cleats.    After the glue is all set, remove the clamps and scrape off any glue  that may be on the wood. If this glue is not removed it will keep the  stain from entering the wood, which will show up when finished in white  spots.    This couch may be stained in any of the shades of brown or dark to  harmonize with its lines of construction. A water stain will penetrate  the wood best and after this is applied and thoroughly dried the surface  should be well sanded to remove the roughness of the raised grain. Apply  one coat of thin shellac and when this is dry, put on two coats of wax.    In making up the cushions, use either hair or elastic felt for the  filling.          ELECTRIC SHADE FOR THE DINING ROOM      The dining shade shown is constructed of wood and glass. There will be  needed the following:      8 pieces, 3/4 by 3/4 by 24 in., S-4-S, oak.    4 pieces, 3/4 by 3/4 by 4 in., S-4-S, oak.    4 pieces, 3/4 by 3/4 by 10-1/2 in., S-4-S, oak.    4 pieces, 3/8 by 3/4 by 23 in., S-4-S, oak.    8 pieces, 3/8 by 3/4 by 10 in., S-4-S, oak.    4 pieces, 3/8 by 3/4 by 9 in., S-4-S, oak.    1 piece, 3/4 by 8 by 8 in., S-4-S, oak.    Begin work by shaping the ends of the longest pieces as shown in the  drawing. All the angles are 45 deg. Next lay out the cross-lap joints at  the corners so that two sets of horizontal frames shall be formed 23 by  23 in. Cut four pieces to a length of 3 in. each. Also shape up the  \"false\" extensions of these pieces which are to be fastened below the  lower frame at the corners. Since these are to be cut from the pieces  just specified, the easiest way is to shape the end of each to the  required angle and then crosscut. Rabbet these pieces sufficient to  allow the art glass to set in on the back sides and be fastened--about  1/4 in. will do--and put them together with glue and brads.    [Illustration: Details of Shade]    Now make the top square in a similar manner, except the rabbets. In this  top square is to be fitted the 3/4-in. board which is to hold the lights  and to which the chains are to be fastened.    The sloping sides are next to be made. The sides are to be built up  separately, the corners being lapped and glued after rabbeting the under  arrises sufficient to let the glass in. The four sides are mitered  together at their edges and reinforced by covering the joint with  copper.    These sides are next mitered to the top and bottom frames"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#4)"],[1,"now, Denis!\" In fact, his subsequent performances were  not of equal merit.    _Jacob Borissovitch Kniajnine_ (1742-91), a clever adapter of  French tragedy.    _Simeonova_, a celebrated tragic actress, who retired from  the stage in early life and married a Prince Gagarine.    _Ozeroff_, one of the best-known Russian dramatists of the  period; he possessed more originality than Kniajnine. \"Oedipus  in Athens,\" \"Fingal,\" \"Demetrius Donskoi,\" and \"Polyxena,\" are  the best known of his tragedies.    _Katenine_ translated Corneille's tragedies into Russian.    _Didelot_, sometime Director of the ballet at the Opera at  St. Petersburg.]    XVI    My goddesses, where are your shades?  Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?  Are ye replaced by other maids  Who cannot conjure former joys?  Shall I your chorus hear anew,  Russia's Terpsichore review  Again in her ethereal dance?  Or will my melancholy glance  On the dull stage find all things changed,  The disenchanted glass direct  Where I can no more recollect?--  A careless looker-on estranged  In silence shall I sit and yawn  And dream of life's delightful dawn?    XVII    The house is crammed. A thousand lamps  On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,  Impatiently the gallery stamps,  The curtain now they slowly raise.  Obedient to the magic strings,  Brilliant, ethereal, there springs  Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding  Istomina(*) the nimbly-bounding;  With one foot resting on its tip  Slow circling round its fellow swings  And now she skips and now she springs  Like down from Aeolus's lip,  Now her lithe form she arches o'er  And beats with rapid foot the floor.    [Note: Istomina--A celebrated Circassian dancer of the day, with  whom the poet in his extreme youth imagined himself in love.]    XVIII    Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes  Between the stalls, along the toes;  Seated, a curious look with glasses  On unknown female forms he throws.  Free scope he yields unto his glance,  Reviews both dress and countenance,  With all dissatisfaction shows.  To male acquaintances he bows,  And finally he deigns let fall  Upon the stage his weary glance.  He yawns, averts his countenance,  Exclaiming, \"We must change 'em all!  I long by ballets have been bored,  Now Didelot scarce can be endured!\"    XIX    Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout  Across the stage still madly sweep,  Whilst the tired serving-men without  Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.  Still the loud stamping doth not cease,  Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,  Still everywhere, without, within,  The lamps illuminating shine;  The steed benumbed still pawing stands  And of the irksome harness tires,  And still the coachmen round the fires(11)  Abuse their masters, rub their hands:  But Eugene long hath left the press  To array himself in evening dress.    [Note 11: In Russia large fires are lighted in winter time in front  of the theatres for the benefit of the menials, who, considering  the state of the thermometer, cannot be said to have a jovial  time of it. But in this, as in other cases, \"habit\" alleviates  their lot, and they bear the cold with a wonderful equanimity.]    XX    Faithfully shall I now depict,  Portray the solitary den  Wherein the child of fashion strict  Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?  All that industrial London brings  For tallow, wood and other things  Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,  All which caprice and affluence craves,  All which in Paris eager taste,  Choosing a profitable trade,  For our amusement ever made  And ease and fashionable waste,--  Adorned the apartment of Eugene,  Philosopher just turned eighteen.    XXI    China and bronze the tables weight,  Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,  And, joy of souls effeminate,  Phials of crystal scents enclose.  Combs of all sizes, files of steel,  Scissors both straight and curved as well,  Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes  Both for the nails and for the tushes.  Rousseau, I would remark in passing,(12)  Could not conceive how serious Grimm  Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,  Eloquent raver all-surpassing,--  The friend of liberty and laws  In this case quite mistaken was.    [Note 12: \"Tout le monde sut qu'il (Grimm) mettait du blanc; et  moi, qui n'en croyait rien, je commencai de le croire, non  seulement par l'embellissement de son teint, et pour avoir trouve  des tasses de blanc sur la toilette, mais sur ce qu'entrant un  matin dans sa chambre, je le trouvais brossant ses ongles avec  une petite vergette faite expres, ouvrage qu'il continua fierement  devant moi. Je jugeai qu'un homme qui passe deux heures tous les  matins a brosser ses ongles peut bien passer quelques instants a  remplir de blanc les creux de sa peau.\"                            _Confessions de J. J. Rousseau_]    XXII    The most industrious man alive  May yet be studious of his nails;  What boots it with the age to strive?  Custom the despot soon prevails.  A new Kaverine Eugene mine,  Dreading the world's remarks malign,  Was that which we are wont to call  A fop, in dress pedantical.  Three mortal hours per diem he  Would loiter by the looking-glass,  And from his dressing-room would pass  Like Venus when, capriciously,  The goddess would a masquerade  Attend in male attire arrayed.    XXIII    On this artistical retreat  Having once fixed your interest,  I might to connoisseurs repeat  The style in which my hero dressed;  Though I confess I hardly dare  Describe in detail the affair,  Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,  To Russ indigenous are not;  And also that my feeble verse--  Pardon I ask for such a sin--  With words of foreign origin  Too much I'm given to intersperse,  Though to the Academy I come  And oft its Dictionary thumb.(13)    [Note 13: Refers to Dictionary of the Academy, compiled during the  reign of Catherine II under the supervision of Lomonossoff.]    XXIV    But such is not my project now,  So let us to the ball-room haste,  Whither at headlong speed doth go  Eugene in hackney carriage placed.  Past darkened windows and long streets  Of slumbering citizens he fleets,  Till carriage lamps, a double row,  Cast a gay lustre on the snow,  Which shines with iridescent hues.  He nears a spacious mansion's gate,  By many a lamp illuminate,  And through the lofty windows views  Profiles of lovely dames he knows  And also fashionable beaux.    XXV    Our hero stops and doth alight,  Flies past the porter to the stair,  But, ere he mounts the marble flight,  With hurried hand smooths down his hair.  He enters: in the hall a crowd,  No more the music thunders loud,  Some a mazurka occupies,  Crushing and a confusing noise;  Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,  The feet of graceful ladies fly,  And following them ye might espy  Full many a glance like lightning flash,  And by the fiddle's rushing sound  The voice of jealousy is drowned.    XXVI    In my young days of wild delight  On balls I madly used to dote,  Fond declarations they invite  Or the delivery of a note.  So hearken, every worthy spouse,  I would your vigilance arouse,  Attentive be unto my rhymes  And due precautions take betimes.  Ye mothers also, caution use,  Upon your daughters keep an eye,  Employ your glasses constantly,  For otherwise--God only knows!  I lift a warning voice because  I long have ceased to offend the laws.    XXVII    Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly  I've wasted in amusements vain,  But were it not immoral I  Should dearly like a dance again.  I love its furious delight,  The crowd and merriment and light,  The ladies, their fantastic dress,  Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless  Scarcely in Russia can ye find  Three pairs of handsome female feet;  Ah! I still struggle to forget  A pair; though desolate my mind,  Their memory lingers still and seems  To agitate me in my dreams.    XXVIII    When, where, and in what desert land,  Madman, wilt thou from memory raze  Those feet? Alas! on what far strand  Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?  Lapped in your Eastern luxury,  No trace ye left in passing by  Upon the dreary northern snows,  But better loved the soft repose  Of splendid carpets richly wrought.  I once forgot for your sweet cause  The thirst for fame and man's applause,  My country and an exile's lot;  My joy in youth was fleeting e'en  As your light footprints on the green.    XXIX    Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,  Are admirable, my dear friend,  But yet Terpsichore bespeaks  Charms more enduring in the end.  For promises her feet reveal  Of untold gain she must conceal,  Their privileged allurements fire  A hidden train of wild desire.  I love them, O my dear Elvine,(14)  Beneath the table-cloth of white,  In winter on the fender bright,  In springtime on the meadows green,  Upon the ball-room's glassy floor  Or by the ocean's rocky shore.    [Note 14: _Elvine_, or _Elvina_, was not improbably the owner of the  seductive feet apostrophized by the poet, since, in 1816, he wrote  an ode, \"To Her,\" which commences thus:    \"Elvina, my dear, come, give me thine hand,\" and so forth.]    XXX    Beside the stormy sea one day  I envied sore the billows tall,  Which rushed in eager dense array  Enamoured at her feet to fall.  How like the billow I desired  To kiss the feet which I admired!  No, never in the early blaze  Of fiery youth's untutored days  So ardently did I desire  A young Armida's lips to press,  Her cheek of rosy loveliness  Or bosom full of languid fire,--  A gust of passion never tore  My spirit with such pangs before.    XXXI    Another time, so willed it Fate,  Immersed in secret thought I stand  And grasp a stirrup fortunate--  Her foot was in my other hand.  Again imagination blazed,  The contact of the foot I raised  Rekindled in my withered heart  The fires of passion and its smart--  Away! and cease to ring their praise  For ever with thy tattling lyre,  The proud ones are not worth the fire  Of passion they so often raise.  The words and looks of charmers sweet "]]]
