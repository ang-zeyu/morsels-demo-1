[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27868"],[0,"The Glow-Worm and Other Beetles (#4)"],[1,"of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;  and the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as  when it is produced by the contact of the air with the real phosphorus  of the chemists. Let us add that, in aerated water, the luminousness  continues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it is extinguished  in water deprived of its air by boiling. No better proof could be  found of what I have already propounded, namely, that the Glow-worm's  light is the effect of a slow oxidization.    The light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark  dropped by the full moon. Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble  illuminant. If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect  darkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, and even  words, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible beyond  a narrow zone. A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's  patience.    Suppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another. Each  of them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to light up  its neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each  individual specimen. But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in  which our eyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a medium  distance. The collective lights confuse the link-bearers into one  vague whole.    Photography gives us a striking proof of this. I have a score of  females, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage in  the open air. A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their  establishment. When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle  and strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at  every point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous  clusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the  photographer's plates and paper. My hopes are disappointed. All that I  obtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense there  according to the numbers forming the group. There is no picture of the  Glow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of thyme. For  want of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is represented by a  blurred splash of white on a black ground.    The beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,  invitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the  lower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the summoned  males, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel overhead, in the  air, sometimes a great way up. In its normal position, therefore, the  glittering lure is concealed from the eyes of those concerned; it is  covered by the thick bulk of the bride. The lantern ought really to  gleam on the back and not under the belly; otherwise the light is  hidden under a bushel.    The anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every female  has her little wiles of coquetry. At nightfall, every evening, my  caged captives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have  thoughtfully furnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper  branches, those most in sight. Here, instead of keeping quiet, as they  did at the foot of the bush just now, they indulge in violent  exercises, twist the tip of their very flexible abdomen, turn it to  one side, turn it to the other, jerk it in every direction. In this  way, the search-light cannot fail to gleam, at one moment or another,  before the eyes of every male who goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood,  whether on the ground or in the air.    It is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching  Larks. If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird  indifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it  excites it.    While the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains,  the male, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited to  catch from afar the least reflection of the calling-signal. His  corselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in  the form of a peaked cap or eye-shade, the object of which appears to  be to limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the  luminous speck to be discerned. Under this arch are the two eyes,  which are relatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a  skull-cap and contiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow groove  for the insertion of the antennae. This double eye, occupying almost  the whole face of the insect and contained in the cavern formed by the  spreading peak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclop's eye.    At the moment of the pairing, the illumination becomes much fainter,  is almost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble  fairy-lamp of the last segment. This discreet night-light is enough  for the wedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects,  lingering over their respective affairs, murmur the universal  marriage-hymn. The laying follows very soon. The round, white eggs are  laid, or rather strewn at random, without the least care on the  mother's part, either on the more or less cool earth or on a blade of  grass. These brilliant ones know nothing at all of family-affection.    Here is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even  when still contained in the mother's womb. If I happen by accident to  crush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny  streak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel  filled with a phosphorescent fluid. The lens shows me that I am wrong.  The luminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of the ovary.  Besides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of the eggs is  already made manifest without this clumsy midwifery. A soft opalescent  light shines through the skin of the belly.    The hatching follows soon after the laying. The young of either sex  have two little rush-lights on the last segment. At the approach of  the severe weather, they go down into the ground, but not very far. In  my rearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose earth,  they descend to a depth of three or four inches at most. I dig up a  few in mid-winter. I always find them carrying their faint  stern-light. About the month of April, they come up again to the  surface, there to continue and complete their evolution.    From start to finish, the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of light.  The eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise. The full-grown females are  magnificent light-houses, the adult males retain the glimmer which the  grubs already possessed. We can understand the object of the feminine  beacon; but of what use is all the rest of the pyrotechnic display? To  my great regret, I cannot tell. It is and will be, for many a day to  come, perhaps for all time, the secret of animal physics, which is  deeper than the physics of the books.          CHAPTER II  THE SITARES      The high banks of sandy clay in the country round about Carpentras are  the favourite haunts of a host of Bees and Wasps, those lovers of a  thoroughly sunny aspect and of soils that are easy to excavate. Here,  in the month of May, two Anthophorae[1] are especially abundant,  gatherers of honey and, both of them, makers of subterranean cells.  One, _A. parietina_, builds at the entrance of her dwelling an  advanced fortification, an earthy cylinder, wrought in open work, like  that of the Odynerus,[2] and curved like it, but of the width and  length of a man's finger. When the community is a populous one, we  stand amazed at the rustic ornamentation formed by all these  stalactites of clay hanging from the facade. The other, _A. pilipes_,  who is very much more frequent, leaves the opening of her corridor  bare. The chinks between the stones in old walls and abandoned hovels,  the surfaces of excavations in soft sandstone or marl, are found  suitable for her labours; but the favourite spots, those to which the  greatest number of swarms resort, are vertical stretches, exposed to  the south, such as are afforded by the cuttings of deeply sunken  roads. Here, over areas many yards in width, the wall is drilled with  a multitude of holes, which impart to the earthy mass the look of some  enormous sponge. These round holes might be fashioned with an auger,  so regular are they. Each is the entrance to a winding corridor, which  runs to a depth of four to six inches. The cells are distributed at  the far end. If we would witness the labours of the industrious Bee,  we must repair to her workshop during the latter half of May. Then,  but at a respectful distance, if, as novices, we are afraid of being  stung, we may contemplate, in all its bewildering activity, the  tumultuous, buzzing swarm, busied with the building and the  provisioning of the cells.    [Footnote 1: Cf. _The Mason-bees_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by  Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chap. viii.; and _Bramble-bees and  Others_, by J.

Henri Fabre, translated by  Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chaps. vi. and x.--_Translator's Note_.]    It is most often during the months of August and September, those  happy months of the summer holidays, that I have visited the banks  inhabited by the Anthophora. At this period all is silent near the  nests; the work has long been completed; and numbers of Spiders' webs  line the crevices or plunge their silken tubes into the Bee's  corridors. Let us not, however, hastily abandon the city once so  populous, so full of life and bustle and now deserted. A few inches  below the surface, thousands of larvae and nymphs, imprisoned in their  cells of clay, are resting until the coming spring. Might not such a  succulent prey as these larvae, paralysed and incapable of defence,  tempt certain parasites who are industrious enough to attain them?

A quiet, quaint boy was Demi, serious, yet cheery, quite  unconscious that he was unusually bright and beautiful, yet quick to see  and love intelligence or beauty in other children. Very fond of books,  and full of lively fancies, born of a strong imagination and a spiritual  nature, these traits made his parents anxious to balance them with  useful knowledge and healthful society, lest they should make him one of  those pale precocious children who amaze and delight a family sometimes,  and fade away like hot-house flowers, because the young soul blooms too  soon, and has not a hearty body to root it firmly in the wholesome soil  of this world.    So Demi was transplanted to Plumfield, and took so kindly to the life  there, that Meg and John and Grandpa felt satisfied that they had done  well. Mixing with other boys brought out the practical side of him,  roused his spirit, and brushed away the pretty cobwebs he was so fond of  spinning in that little brain of his. To be sure, he rather shocked  his mother when he came home, by banging doors, saying \"by George\"  emphatically, and demanding tall thick boots \"that clumped like papa's.\"  But John rejoiced over him, laughed at his explosive remarks, got the  boots, and said contentedly,    \"He is doing well; so let him clump. I want my son to be a manly boy,  and this temporary roughness won't hurt him. We can polish him up by  and by; and as for learning, he will pick that up as pigeons do peas. So  don't hurry him.\"    Daisy was as sunshiny and charming as ever, with all sorts of  womanlinesses budding in her, for she was like her gentle mother,  and delighted in domestic things. She had a family of dolls, whom she  brought up in the most exemplary manner; she could not get on without  her little work-basket and bits of sewing, which she did so nicely, that  Demi frequently pulled out his handkerchief to display her neat stitches,  and Baby Josy had a flannel petticoat beautifully made by Sister Daisy.  She like to quiddle about the china-closet, prepare the salt-cellars,  put the spoons straight on the table; and every day went round the  parlor with her brush, dusting chairs and tables. Demi called her a  \"Betty,\" but was very glad to have her keep his things in order, lend  him her nimble fingers in all sorts of work, and help him with his  lessons, for they kept abreast there, and had no thought of rivalry.    The love between them was as strong as ever; and no one could laugh  Demi out of his affectionate ways with Daisy. He fought her battles  valiantly, and never could understand why boys should be ashamed to  say \"right out,\" that they loved their sisters. Daisy adored her twin,  thought \"my brother\" the most remarkable boy in the world, and every  morning, in her little wrapper, trotted to tap at his door with a  motherly \"Get up, my dear, it's 'most breakfast time; and here's your  clean collar.\"    Rob was an energetic morsel of a boy, who seemed to have discovered the  secret of perpetual motion, for he never was still. Fortunately, he was  not mischievous, nor very brave; so he kept out of trouble pretty well,  and vibrated between father and mother like an affectionate little  pendulum with a lively tick, for Rob was a chatterbox.    Teddy was too young to play a very important part in the affairs of  Plumfield, yet he had his little sphere, and filled it beautifully.  Every one felt the need of a pet at times, and Baby was always ready to  accommodate, for kissing and cuddling suited him excellently. Mrs.  Jo seldom stirred without him; so he had his little finger in all the  domestic pies, and every one found them all the better for it, for they  believed in babies at Plumfield.    Dick Brown, and Adolphus or Dolly Pettingill, were two eight year-olds.  Dolly stuttered badly, but was gradually getting over it, for no one was  allowed to mock him and Mr. Bhaer tried to cure it, by making him talk  slowly. Dolly was a good little lad, quite uninteresting and ordinary,  but he flourished here, and went through his daily duties and pleasures  with placid content and propriety.    Dick Brown's affliction was a crooked back, yet he bore his burden so  cheerfully, that Demi once asked in his queer way, \"Do humps make people  good-natured? I'd like one if they do.\" Dick was always merry, and did  his best to be like other boys, for a plucky spirit lived in the  feeble little body. When he first came, he was very sensitive about his  misfortune, but soon learned to forget it, for no one dared remind him  of it, after Mr. Bhaer had punished one boy for laughing at him.    \"God don't care; for my soul is straight if my back isn't,\" sobbed Dick  to his tormentor on that occasion; and, by cherishing this idea, the  Bhaers soon led him to believe that people also loved his soul, and did  not mind his body, except to pity and help him to bear it.    Playing menagerie once with the others, some one said,    \"What animal will you be, Dick?\"    \"Oh, I'm the dromedary; don't you see the hump on my back?\" was the  laughing answer.    \"So you are, my nice little one that don't carry loads, but marches by  the elephant first in the procession,\" said Demi, who was arranging the  spectacle.    \"I hope others will be as kind to the poor dear as my boys have learned  to be,\" said Mrs. Jo, quite satisfied with the success of her teaching,  as Dick ambled past her, looking like a very happy, but a very feeble  little dromedary, beside stout Stuffy, who did the elephant with  ponderous propriety.    Jack Ford was a sharp, rather a sly lad, who was sent to this school,  because it was cheap. Many men would have thought him a smart boy, but  Mr. Bhaer did not like his way of illustrating that Yankee word, and  thought his unboyish keenness and money-loving as much of an affliction  as Dolly's stutter, or Dick's hump.    Ned Barker was like a thousand other boys of fourteen, all legs,  blunder, and bluster. Indeed the family called him the \"Blunderbuss,\"  and always expected to see him tumble over the chairs, bump against the  tables, and knock down any small articles near him. He bragged a good  deal about what he could do, but seldom did any thing to prove it, was  not brave, and a little given to tale-telling. He was apt to bully the  small boys, and flatter the big ones, and without being at all bad, was  just the sort of fellow who could very easily be led astray.    George Cole had been spoilt by an over-indulgent mother, who stuffed him  with sweetmeats till he was sick, and then thought him too delicate  to study, so that at twelve years old, he was a pale, puffy boy, dull,  fretful, and lazy. A friend persuaded her to send him to Plumfield, and  there he soon got waked up, for sweet things were seldom allowed, much  exercise required, and study made so pleasant, that Stuffy was gently  lured along, till he quite amazed his anxious mamma by his improvement,  and convinced her that there was really something remarkable in  Plumfield air.    Billy Ward was what the Scotch tenderly call an \"innocent,\" for though  thirteen years old, he was like a child of six. He had been an unusually  intelligent boy, and his father had hurried him on too fast, giving him  all sorts of hard lessons, keeping at his books six hours a day, and  expecting him to absorb knowledge as a Strasburg goose does the food  crammed down its throat. He thought he was doing his duty, but he nearly  killed the boy, for a fever gave the poor child a sad holiday, and when  he recovered, the overtasked brain gave out, and Billy's mind was like a  slate over which a sponge has passed, leaving it blank.    It was a terrible lesson to his ambitious father; he could not bear the  sight of his promising child, changed to a feeble idiot, and he sent  him away to Plumfield, scarcely hoping that he could be helped, but sure  that he would be kindly treated. Quite docile and harmless was Billy,  and it was pitiful to see how hard he tried to learn, as if groping  dimly after the lost knowledge which had cost him so much.    Day after day, he pored over the alphabet, proudly said A and B, and  thought that he knew them, but on the morrow they were gone, and all  the work was to be done over again. Mr. Bhaer had infinite patience with  him, and kept on in spite of the apparent hopelessness of the task, not  caring for book lessons, but trying gently to clear away the mists from  the darkened mind, and give it back intelligence enough to make the boy  less a burden and an affliction.    Mrs. Bhaer strengthened his health by every aid she could invent, and  the boys all pitied and were kind to him. He did not like their active  plays, but would sit for hours watching the doves, would dig holes for  Teddy till even that ardent grubber was satisfied, or follow Silas, the  man, from place to place seeing him work, for honest Si was very good to  him, and though he forgot his letters Billy remembered friendly faces.    Tommy Bangs was the scapegrace of the school, and the most trying  scapegrace that ever lived. As full of mischief as a monkey, yet  so good-hearted that one could not help forgiving his tricks; so  scatter-brained that words went by him like the wind, yet so penitent  for every misdeed, that it was impossible to keep sober when he  vowed tremendous vows of reformation, or proposed all sorts of queer  punishments to be inflicted upon himself. Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer lived in  a state of preparation for any mishap, from the breaking of Tommy's own  neck, to the blowing up of the entire family with gunpowder; and Nursey  had a particular drawer in which she kept bandages, plasters, and salves  for his especial use, for Tommy was always being brought in half dead;  but "]]]
