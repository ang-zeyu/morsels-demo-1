The erection of the  spire, evidently not included in the original plan, is often  erroneously assigned to Wyville (1336-1375), who certainly completed  the wall of the close, and enlarged the cloisters. The King granted  him a charter for this purpose, and also gave him the stones of the  old Cathedral, many of which, with the Norman work upon them, may be  seen plainly at the present time. (See p. 22.)    It is interesting to note that not only is Salisbury the most complete  example of its period in this country, but is also the first important  building carried out entirely in the style we now know as early  English. Henry III. is believed to have been so enthusiastic in his  admiration of Bishop Poore's new Cathedral that he set about the  rebuilding of Westminster Abbey, which was commenced in 1245 and  completed in 1269, as far as the east end of the choir. The early  English work at Salisbury has a certain poverty of detail when  compared with Westminster, and the \"Angel Choir\" of Lincoln  undoubtedly surpasses both; yet the effect of Salisbury has a  character of its own and a purity in its ornament that is in itself a  distinction. The Cathedral of Amiens, of exactly the same date, covers  71,000 square feet, Salisbury but 55,000; the vault of Amiens is 152  feet high, Salisbury only 85; but, as Fergusson observes in his  \"Handbook of Architecture,\" the fair mode of comparison is to ask  whether the Cathedral of Amiens is finer than Salisbury would be if  the latter were at least twice as large as it is.    There has long been a tradition that Elias de Dereham was the  architect of this stately pile, and the information gathered together  by the Rev. J.A. Bennet, in a paper read before the British  Archaeological Association at Salisbury on August 5th, 1887, certainly  does much to strengthen the belief. From this account, and other  sources, we find that Elias de Derham is first mentioned in the Rot.  Chartarum, Ap. 6 (6 John, 1208)? where he is described as one of the  King's clerks and Rector of Meauton. In 1206 he appears to have been a  royal official. In 1209 he is reported to have been the architect for  the repairs of King John's palace at Westminster. In 1212 he attached  himself to the opposite party, but was taken again into the King's  favour in the following year. We have specially interesting notice of  his work in 1220, when he was engaged upon the shrine of St. Thomas at  Canterbury. Matthew Paris, in his account of the translation of St.  Thomas, distinctly states that the shrine was the work of that  incomparable officer, Walter de Colchester, Sacrist of St. Albans,  assisted by Elias de Dereham, Canon of Salisbury. Leland mentions, in  an extract from an old \"Martyrologie\" of Salisbury, that he was  rector--or director--of the new church for twenty-five years from the  beginning, whether he means architect or clerk of the works is not so  clear. His name, as one of the Canons of the Cathedral, occurs eleven  times in the \"Osmund Register\" at Salisbury. There are also references  to him in the \"Book of Evidences\" (Liber Evidentiarum) among the  bishop's muniments, as the builder of the original Aula  Plumbea--Leden-hall--a famous old house in the close. The document is  entitled \"_Scriptura de domibus de Leden-hall per Eliam de Dereham  sumptuose constructis_,\" \"a deed concerning the house called  Leden-hall, built at great expense by Elias de Dereham.\" This  residence house remained six centuries after in the gift of the Bishop  of Sarum.    During the year in which he accompanied Bishop Poore in his  translation to Durham, and from 1230 to 1238, he was employed upon  some architectural work connected with Durham Cathedral, which, when  Bishop Poore accepted it was a stately Norman fane with an apsidal  choir; he removed this east end, and remodelled it in the early  English manner. The chapel of the Nine Altars, as this portion is  called, is remarkably similar in its details to much of the work at  Salisbury. It is curious that two southern churches so near as  Salisbury and Christchurch Priory should be found influencing or  influenced by the great northern cathedral, but the likeness between  Flambard's Norman work at Christchurch and the same bishop's work at  Durham is as strongly marked as the Early English of Bishop Poore at  both the churches in which he was enthroned. That Elias de Dereham is  responsible for much of the work of both cathedrals is also a fair  assumption. Curiously enough his name, hitherto hastily assumed to be  equivalent to Elias of Durham, has probably no connection with that  city; whether, however, his patronym should be traced to the Norfolk  Dereham, or the Gloucester Dyrham, it is impossible to say with any  certainty. On somewhat insufficient grounds it has been hazarded that  his portrait may be found in a figure on the east side of the  staircase buttress of what was formerly the great entrance to Wells  Cathedral.    Owing to the fact that the original design of the building was fully  carried out, with the addition of a tower and spire, its architectural  history ceases just where most others begin their chequered career. At  the time of the Reformation it suffered but little, except in the  wholesale destruction of its stained glass. Dr. Pope, in his \"Life of  Bishop Ward,\" says that even during the Civil War, when it was  abandoned, workmen were engaged to keep it in repair, who when  questioned as to the authority by which they worked, said, \"Those who  employ'd us will pay us; trouble not your selves to inquire who they  are. Whoever they are, they do not desire to have their names known.\"  We find as evidence of the secret influence exerted in its behalf that  when one of Waller's officers sent up to the Parliament certain plate  and a pulpit cloth from Salisbury Cathedral, he was ordered to restore  them, as it was considered that he had overstepped his commission; all  that was retained being certain copes, hangings, and a picture of the  Virgin.    At the Restoration, Bishop Ward, after a great thunderstorm in 1668,  when fears were entertained for the safety of the spire, called in Sir  Christopher Wren, who, after examining the tower, expressed his belief  \"that a spire was not contemplated by its builders;\" that \"out of fear  to overburden the four piers of the tower, its inside was carried for  40 feet above the nave with a slender hollow work of pillars and  arches, nor hath it any buttresses; the spire itself is but 9 inches  thick, though the height be above 150 feet.\" This work of pillars and  arches led him to conclude that the architect laid his first floor of  timber 40 feet higher than the vault beneath.    Dr. Walter Pope, in his \"Life of Bishop Seth Ward,\" 1697, describes  the restorations accomplished by this excellent prelate: \"There being,  therefore, not much to be done as to reparation, he employ'd himself  in the Decoration of the Cathedral: First, at his proper charges  Paving the Cloyster. I mean that side of it which leads out of his  garden into the church. At his exhortation, and more than  proportinable (_sic_) expence the Pavement of the Church was mended  where it was faulty, and the whole Quire laid with white and black  squares of marble. The Bishops, Deans, and all the Prebendaries Stalls  made New & Magnificent, and the whole church was kept so clean, that  anyone who had occasion for Dust to throw on the Superscription of a  Letter, he would have a hard task to find it there.... His next care  was to repair, I might almost say rebuild his Palace, which was much  ruined, the Hall being pulled down, & the Greater part of the House  converted to an Inn ... what remained of the Palace was divided into  small Tenements and let out to poor Handicraft-men. This dilapidation  was the work of one Van Ling, a Dutchman, by trade a Taylor, who  bought it of Parliament when Bishop's lands were exposed to sale.\"    In the minutes of the chapter for August 26th, 1789, we find  instruction given to Wyatt \"to make new Canopies to the Stalls, to  build a new Pulpit and Bishop's Throne, to put new Iron Rails to the  Communion, with coping thereon, and set new blue stone steps to  receive the same, to put two Wainscot Screens across the Aisles, to  lay blue stone paving in the Lady Chapel, in squares to be cut out of  the old gravestones, and enrich the side walls according to the  drawings, to clean and colour the church from the East end of the  Transept, and make the Screen to the Western Side of the organ.\" They  also ordered \"the beam in the choir to be removed, the North and South  Porches to be taken down, the south door near the Verger's house  stopped up, and another opened near the Chapter Vestry, to open out  the Chapel in the great North and South Transepts, and to convert the  north-east transept into a morning chapel, to remove certain monuments  in consequence of alterations in St. Mary's Chapel, & to take down the  Beauchamp & Hungerford Chapels, on the plea that they were in a state  as to greatly exceed any ordinary or possible means of repair.\" These  formal instructions were not merely obeyed but exceeded, and the  demolitions of that time confront the student of the building in all  his researches. Of late years many minor alterations have been carried  out, with a view to restore monuments to their original site, and, as  far as possible, to obliterate Wyatt's damage; but the two superb  chantries, the bell tower, the painted glass, and many other important  features are hopelessly effaced, and the cathedral, spared by its  avowed foes, has met with its greatest disaster from the hands of  former guardians.    For the last thirty years the work of restoration has been gradually  carried on until its recent completion. An arrangement was made in  1862 by which the Ecclesiastical Commissioners permitted the Dean and  Chapter to spend L10,000 on the building, as part of a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23672"],[0,"Die epiphytische Vegetation Amerikas (#4)"],[1,"olystachya. -- \"  \"    Cyrtopodium. -- \"  \"    Zygopetalum. -- \"  \"    Grobya. -- Brasil.

Als erstes allgemeines Ergebniss dieses Verzeichnisses koennen wir den  Satz aufstellen, dass _die Zahl der in der Epiphytengenossenschaft  vertretenen Familien eine geringe ist, dass mehrere derselben aber im  Verhaeltniss zu ihrem Umfange eine auffallend grosse Zahl epiphytischer  Arten fuehren_, so die Farne, Orchideen, Bromeliaceen, Araceen, Gesneraceen  und Vacciniaceen. Mehrere der groessten Familien des tropischen Amerika  entbehren epiphytischer Arten gaenzlich, so die Graeser, Palmen,  Euphorbiaceen, Rutaceen, Lauraceen, Leguminosen etc.    Als zweites bemerkenswerthes Ergebniss unserer Liste ist die _grosse  systematische Uebereinstimmung der Epiphytengenossenschaft in der alten  und der neuen Welt_, abgesehen natuerlich von solchen Familien, die auf die  letztere ganz beschraenkt sind (Bromeliaceen, Mangroviaceen).    2. Manche scharf ausgepraegte Pflanzengenossenschaften, z. B. diejenigen  der Wasserpflanzen, der Strandpflanzen, der Mangrovepflanzen, verhalten  sich denjenigen der Epiphyten insofern ganz analog, als sie sich ebenfalls  hauptsaechlich aus bestimmten Familien recrutiren. Es braucht nur an die  Potameen und Nymphacaceen, die Combretaceen und Rhizophoreen, die  Plumbagineen, Cruciferen und Salsolaceen erinnert zu werden. _Waehrend uns  aber in diesen Faellen die Ursache der Bevorzugung gewisser Familien, des  gaenzlichen Fehlens anderer ganz unbekannt ist, koennen wir die  systematische Zusammensetzung der Epiphytengenossenschaft, theilweise  wenigstens, auf ihre Factoren zurueckfuehren._    _Die erste Bedingung, damit eine Pflanze der epiphytischen Genossenschaft  gehoeren koenne, ist, dass ihre Samen zur Verbreitung auf Baumaesten geeignet  seien, was bekanntlich durchaus nicht von allen Samen __ gilt; ausserdem  muessen sie an dem Substrat haengen bleiben und auf demselben die zur  Keimung noethige Wassermenge finden,_ -- zwei Bedingungen, die die Zahl der  tauglichen Samenarten wiederum sehr herabmindern.    _Die Samen epiphytischer Gewaechse lassen sich in drei biologische  Categorien eintheilen, die alle drei den eben erwaehnten Hauptbedingnngen  vollkommen entsprechen._    Die _erste Categorie_ umfasst diejenigen Samen, welche von einer saftigen  Huelle umgeben sind und daher von Voegeln, Affen und sonstigen  baumbewohnenden Thieren verbreitet werden; derartige Samen finden, falls  sie nicht zu gross sind, in den Excrementen einen genuegenden Kitt und sind  gleichzeitig gegen das Austrocknen geschuetzt. Derartige Samen sind unter  den Epiphyten ausserordentlich verbreitet. Sie finden sich bei den  epiphytischen _Araceen_, _Liliaceen_ (Astelia, Luzuriaga.),  _Cyclanthaceen_, _Bromeliaceen_ e. p., _Zingiberaceen_ (Arillus bei  Hedychium), _Melastomaceen_ e. p. (Dicellandra, Medinilla, Pogonanthera,  Pachycentria, Blakea etc.), _Gesneraceen_ e. p. (Episcia, Columnea,  Drymonia, Alloplectus, Hypocyrta, Codonanthe, "]]]
