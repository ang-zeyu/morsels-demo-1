Yes, our Earth is an orb of the Heavens: the sky is her domain, and our  Sun, shining above our heads, and fertilizing our seasons, is as much a  star as the pretty sparkling points that scintillate up there, in the  far distance, and embellish the calm of our nights with their  brilliancy. All are in the Heavens, you as well as I, for the Earth, in  her course through Space, bears us with herself into the depths of  Infinitude.    In the Heavens there is neither \"above\" nor \"below.\" These words do not  exist in celestial speech, because their significance is relative to the  surface of this planet only. In reality, for the inhabitants of the  Earth, \"low\" is the inside, the center of the globe, and \"high\" is what  is above our heads, all round the Earth. The Heavens are what surround  us on all sides, to Infinity.    The Earth is, like her fellows, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,  Uranus, Neptune, one of the planets of the great solar family.    The Sun, her father, protects her, and directs all her actions. She, as  the grateful daughter, obeys him blindly. All float in perfect harmony  over the celestial ocean.    But, you may say, on what does the Earth rest in her ethereal  navigation?    On nothing. The Earth turns round the colossal Sun, a little globe of  relatively light weight, isolated on all sides in Space, like a  soap-bubble blown by some careless child.    Above, below, on all sides, millions of similar globes are grouped into  families, and form other systems of worlds revolving round the numerous  and distant stars that people Infinitude; suns more or less analogous to  that by which we are illuminated, and generally speaking of larger bulk,  although our Sun is a million times larger than our planet.    Among the ancients, before the isolation of our globe in Space and the  motions that incessantly alter its position were recognized, the Earth  was supposed to be the immobile lower half of the Universe. The sky was  regarded as the upper half. The ancients supplied our world with  fantastic supports that penetrated to the Infernal Regions. They could  not admit the notion of the Earth's isolation, because they had a false  idea of its weight. To-day, however, we know positively that the Earth  is based on nothing. The innumerable journeys accomplished round it in  all directions give definite proof of this. It is attached to nothing.  As we said before, there is neither \"above\" nor \"below\" in the Universe.  What we call \"below\" is the center of the Earth. For the rest the Earth  turns upon its own axis in twenty-four hours. Night is only a partial  phenomenon, due to the rotary motion of the planet, a motion that could  not exist under conditions other than that of the absolute isolation of  our globe in space.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--The earth in space. June solstice, midday.]    Since the Sun can only illuminate one side of our globe at one moment,  that is to say one hemisphere, it follows that Night is nothing but the  state of the part that is not illuminated. As the Earth revolves upon  itself, all the parts successively exposed to the Sun are in the day,  while the parts situated opposite to the Sun, in the cone of shadow  produced by the Earth itself, are in night. But whether it be noon or  midnight, the stars always occupy the same position in the Heavens,  even when, dazzled by the ardent light of the orb of day, we can no  longer see them; and when we are plunged into the darkness of the night,  the god Phoebus still continues to pour his beneficent rays upon the  countries turned toward him.    The sequence of day and night is a phenomenon belonging, properly  speaking, to the Earth, in which the rest of the Universe does not  participate. The same occurs for every world that is illuminated by a  sun, and endowed with a rotary movement. In absolute space, there is no  succession of nights and days.    Upheld in space by forces that will be explained at a later point, our  planet glides in the open heavens round our Sun.    Imagine a magnificent aerostat, lightly and rapidly cleaving space.  Surround it with eight little balloons of different sizes, the smallest  like those sold on the streets for children to play with, the larger,  such as are distributed for a bonus in large stores. Imagine this group  sailing through the air, and you have the system of our worlds in  miniature.    Still, this is only an image, a comparison. The balloons are held up by  the atmosphere, in which they float at equilibrium. The Earth is  sustained by nothing material. What maintains her in equilibrium is the  ethereal void; an immaterial force; gravitation. The Sun attracts her,  and if she did not revolve, she would drop into him; but rotating round  him, at a speed of 107,000 kilometers[2] (about 66,000 miles) per hour,  she produces a centrifugal force, like that of a stone in a sling, that  is precisely equivalent, and of contrary sign, to its gravitation toward  the central orb, and these two equilibrated forces keep her at the same  medium distance.    This solar and planetary group does not exist solitary in the immense  void that extends indefinitely around us. As we said above, each star  that we admire in the depths of the sky, and to which we lift up our  eyes and thoughts during the charmed hours of the night, is another sun  burning with its own light, the chief of a more or less numerous family,  such as are multiplied through all space to infinity. Notwithstanding  the immense distances between the sun-stars, Space is so vast, and the  number of these so great, that by an effect of perspective due solely to  the distance, appearances would lead us to believe that the stars were  touching. And under certain telescopic aspects, and in some of the  astral photographs, they really do appear to be contiguous.    The Universe is infinite. Space is limitless. If our love for the  Heavens should incite in us the impulse, and provide us with the means  of undertaking a journey directed to the ends of Heaven as its goal, we  should be astonished, on arriving at the confines of the Milky Way, to  see the grandiose and phenomenal spectacle of a new Universe unfold  before our dazzled eyes; and if in our mad career we crossed this new  archipelago of worlds to seek the barriers of Heaven beyond them, we  should still find universe eternally succeeding to universe before us.  Millions of suns roll on in the immensities of Space. Everywhere, on all  sides, Creation renews itself in an infinite variety.    According to all the probabilities, universal life is distributed there  as well as here, and has sown the germ of intelligence upon those  distant worlds that we divine in the vicinity of the innumerable suns  that plow the ether, for everything upon the Earth tends to show that  Life is the goal of Nature. Burning foci, inextinguishable sources of  warmth and light, these various, multi-colored suns shed their rays upon  the worlds that belong to them and which they fertilize.    Our globe is no exception in the Universe. As we have seen, it is one of  the celestial orbs, nourished, warmed, lighted, quickened by the Sun,  which in its turn again is but a star.    Innumerable Worlds! We dream of them. Who can say that their unknown  inhabitants do not think of us in their turn, and that Space may not be  traversed by waves of thought, as it is by the vibrations of light and  universal gravitation? May not an immense solidarity, hardly guessed at  by our imperfect senses, exist between the Celestial Humanities, our  Earth being only a modest planet.    Let us meditate on this Infinity! Let us lose no opportunity of  employing the best of our hours, those of the silence and peace of the  bewitching nights, in contemplating, admiring, spelling out the words of  the Great Book of the Heavens. Let our freed souls fly swift and rapt  toward those marvelous countries where indescribable joys are prepared  for us, and let us do homage to the first and most splendid of the  sciences, to Astronomy, which diffuses the light of Truth within us.    To poetical souls, the contemplation of the Heavens carries thought away  to higher regions than it attains in any other meditation. Who does not  remember the beautiful lines of Victor Hugo in the Orientales? Who has  not heard or read them? The poem is called \"Ecstasy,\" and it is a  fitting title. The words are sometimes set to music, and the melody  seems to complete their pure beauty:              J'etais seul pres des flots par une nuit d'etoiles.            Pas un nuage aux cieux, sur les mers pas de voiles;            Mes yeux plongeaient plus loin que le monde reel,            Et les bois et les monts et toute la nature            Semblaient interroger, dans un confus murmure,                Les flots des mers, les feux du ciel.              Et les etoiles d'or, legions infinies,            A voix haute, a voix basse, avec mille harmonies            Disaient, en inclinant leurs couronnes de feu;            Et les flots bleus, que rien ne gouverne et n'arrete,            Disaient en recourbant l'ecume de leur crete:                ... C'est le Seigneur, le Seigneur Dieu!    _Note: Free Translation_              I was alone on the waves, on a starry night,            Not a cloud in the sky, not a sail in sight,            My eyes pierced beyond the natural world...            And the woods, and the hills, and the voice of Nature            Seemed to question in a confused murmur,                The waves of the Sea, and Heaven's fires.              And the golden stars in infinite legion,            Sang loudly, and softly, in glad recognition,            Inclining their crowns of fire;...

The young ones threw inquiring glances at  me from a distance; whilst I approached the youngest, a most delicious  little creature. He drew back; and Charlotte, entering at the very  moment, said, \"Louis, shake hands with your cousin.\" The little fellow  obeyed willingly; and I could not resist giving him a hearty kiss,  notwithstanding his rather dirty face. \"Cousin,\" said I to Charlotte,  as I handed her down, \"do you think I deserve the happiness of being  related to you?\" She replied, with a ready smile, \"Oh! I have such  a number of cousins, that I should be sorry if you were the most  undeserving of them.\" In taking leave, she desired her next sister,  Sophy, a girl about eleven years old, to take great care of the  children, and to say good-bye to papa for her when he came home from his  ride. She enjoined to the little ones to obey their sister Sophy as they  would herself, upon which some promised that they would; but a little  fair-haired girl, about six years old, looked discontented, and said,  \"But Sophy is not you, Charlotte; and we like you best.\" The two eldest  boys had clambered up the carriage; and, at my request, she permitted  them to accompany us a little way through the forest, upon their  promising to sit very still, and hold fast.    We were hardly seated, and the ladies had scarcely exchanged  compliments, making the usual remarks upon each other's dress, and upon  the company they expected to meet, when Charlotte stopped the carriage,  and made her brothers get down. They insisted upon kissing her hands  once more; which the eldest did with all the tenderness of a youth  of fifteen, but the other in a lighter and more careless manner. She  desired them again to give her love to the children, and we drove off.    The aunt inquired of Charlotte whether she had finished the book she had  last sent her. \"No,\" said Charlotte; \"I did not like it: you can have  it again. And the one before was not much better.\" I was surprised, upon  asking the title, to hear that it was ____. (We feel obliged to suppress  the passage in the letter, to prevent any one from feeling aggrieved;  although no author need pay much attention to the opinion of a mere  girl, or that of an unsteady young man.)    I found penetration and character in everything she said: every  expression seemed to brighten her features with new charms,--with  new rays of genius,--which unfolded by degrees, as she felt herself  understood.    \"When I was younger,\" she observed, \"I loved nothing so much as  romances. Nothing could equal my delight when, on some holiday, I could  settle down quietly in a corner, and enter with my whole heart and soul  into the joys or sorrows of some fictitious Leonora. I do not deny that  they even possess some charms for me yet. But I read so seldom, that I  prefer books suited exactly to my taste. And I like those authors best  whose scenes describe my own situation in life,--and the friends who are  about me, whose stories touch me with interest, from resembling my own  homely existence,--which, without being absolutely paradise, is, on the  whole, a source of indescribable happiness.\"    I endeavoured to conceal the emotion which these words occasioned, but  it was of slight avail; for, when she had expressed so truly her opinion  of \"The Vicar of Wakefield,\" and of other works, the names of which I  omit (Though the names are omitted, yet the authors mentioned deserve  Charlotte's approbation, and will feel it in their hearts when they read  this passage. It concerns no other person.), I could no longer contain  myself, but gave full utterance to what I thought of it: and it was not  until Charlotte had addressed herself to the two other ladies, that  I remembered their presence, and observed them sitting mute with  astonishment. The aunt looked at me several times with an air of  raillery, which, however, I did not at all mind.    We talked of the pleasures of dancing. \"If it is a fault to love it,\"  said Charlotte, \"I am ready to confess that I prize it above all other  amusements. If anything disturbs me, I go to the piano, play an air to  which I have danced, and all goes right again directly.\"    You, who know me, can fancy how steadfastly I gazed upon her rich dark  eyes during these remarks, how my very soul gloated over her warm lips  and fresh, glowing cheeks, how I became quite lost in the delightful  meaning of her words, so much so, that I scarcely heard the actual  expressions. In short, I alighted from the carriage like a person in a  dream, and was so lost to the dim world around me, that I scarcely heard  the music which resounded from the illuminated ballroom.    The two Messrs. Andran and a certain N. N. (I cannot trouble myself with  the names), who were the aunt's and Charlotte's partners, received us  at the carriage-door, and took possession of their ladies, whilst I  followed with mine.    We commenced with a minuet. I led out one lady after another, and  precisely those who were the most disagreeable could not bring  themselves to leave off. Charlotte and her partner began an English  country dance, and you must imagine my delight when it was their turn  to dance the figure with us. You should see Charlotte dance. She dances  with her whole heart and soul: her figure is all harmony, elegance,  and grace, as if she were conscious of nothing else, and had no  other thought or feeling; and, doubtless, for the moment, every other  sensation is extinct.    She was engaged for the second country dance, but promised me the third,  and assured me, with the most agreeable freedom, that she was very  fond of waltzing. \"It is the custom here,\" she said, \"for the previous  partners to waltz together; but my partner is an indifferent waltzer,  and will feel delighted if I save him the trouble. Your partner is not  allowed to waltz, and, indeed, is equally incapable: but I observed  during the country dance that you waltz well; so, if you will waltz with  me, I beg you would propose it to my partner, and I will propose it to  yours.\" We agreed, and it was arranged that our partners should mutually  entertain each other.    We set off, and, at first, delighted ourselves with the usual graceful  motions of the arms. With what grace, with what ease, she moved! When  the waltz commenced, and the dancers whirled around each other in the  giddy maze, there was some confusion, owing to the incapacity of some of  the dancers. We judiciously remained still, allowing the others to weary  themselves; and, when the awkward dancers had withdrawn, we joined in,  and kept it up famously together with one other couple,--Andran and his  partner. Never did I dance more lightly. I felt myself more than mortal,  holding this loveliest of creatures in my arms, flying, with her as  rapidly as the wind, till I lost sight of every other object; and O  Wilhelm, I vowed at that moment, that a maiden whom I loved, or for whom  I felt the slightest attachment, never, never should waltz with any one  else but with me, if I went to perdition for it!--you will understand  this.    We took a few turns in the room to recover our breath. Charlotte sat  down, and felt refreshed by partaking of some oranges which I had had  secured,--the only ones that had been left; but at every slice which,  from politeness, she offered to her neighbours, I felt as though a  dagger went through my heart.    We were the second couple in the third country dance. As we were going  down (and Heaven knows with what ecstasy I gazed at her arms and eyes,  beaming with the sweetest feeling of pure and genuine enjoyment),  we passed a lady whom I had noticed for her charming expression of  countenance; although she was no longer young. She looked at Charlotte  with a smile, then, holding up her finger in a threatening attitude,  repeated twice in a very significant tone of voice the name of \"Albert.\"    \"Who is Albert,\" said I to Charlotte, \"if it is not impertinent to ask?\"  She was about to answer, when we were obliged to separate, in order to  execute a figure in the dance; and, as we crossed over again in front of  each other, I perceived she looked somewhat pensive. \"Why need I conceal  it from you?\" she said, as she gave me her hand for the promenade.  \"Albert is a worthy man, to whom I am engaged.\" Now, there was nothing  new to me in this (for the girls had told me of it on the way); but it  was so far new that I had not thought of it in connection with her whom,  in so short a time, I had learned to prize so highly. Enough, I became  confused, got out in the figure, and occasioned general confusion; so  that it required all Charlotte's presence of mind to set me right by  pulling and pushing me into my proper place.    The dance was not yet finished when the lightning which had for some  time been seen in the horizon, and which I had asserted to proceed  entirely from heat, grew more violent; and the thunder was heard above  the music. When any distress or terror surprises us in the midst of our  amusements, it naturally makes a deeper impression than at other times,  either because the contrast makes us more keenly susceptible, or rather  perhaps because our senses are then more open to impressions, and the  shock is consequently stronger. To this cause I must ascribe the fright  and shrieks of the"]]]
