In this way  the slight variations in the growth of different forms are detected and  the peculiar characteristics are determined, so that the student is able  to recognize this form when he meets it again.    These culture methods are of essential importance in bacteriology, as it  is the only way in which it is possible to secure a quantity of germs of  the same kind.    ~The microscope in bacterial investigation.~ In order to verify the purity  of the cultures, the microscope is in constant demand throughout all the  different stages of the isolating process. For this purpose, it is  essential that the instrument used shall be one of strong magnifying  powers (600-800 diameters), combined with sharp definition.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Pure cultures of different kinds of bacteria in  gelatin tubes. _a_, growth slight in this medium; _b_, growth copious at  and near surface. Fine parallel filaments growing out into medium  liquefying at surface; _c_, a rapid liquefying form; _d_, a  gas-producing form that grows equally well in lower part of tube as at  surface (facultative anaerobe); _e_, an obligate anaerobe, that develops  only in absence of air.]    The microscopical examination of any germ is quite as essential as the  determination of culture characteristics; in fact, the two must go hand  in hand. The examination reveals not only the form and size of the  individual germs, but the manner in which they are united with each  other, as well as any peculiarities of movement that they may possess.    In carrying out the microscopical part of the work, not only is the  organism examined in a living condition, but preparations are made by  using solutions of anilin dyes as staining agents. These are of great  service in bringing out almost imperceptible differences. The art of  staining has been carried to the highest degree of perfection in  bacteriology, especially in the detection of germs that are found in  diseased tissues in the animal or human body.    In studying the peculiarities of any special organism, not only is it  necessary that these cultural and microscopical characters should be  closely observed, but special experiments must be carried out along  different lines, in order to determine any special properties that the  germ may possess. Thus, the ability of any form to act as a fermentative  organism can be tested by fermentation experiments; the property of  causing disease, studied by the inoculation of pure cultures into  animals. A great many different methods have been devised for the  purpose of studying special characteristics of different bacteria, but a  full description of these would necessarily be so lengthy that in a work  of this character they must be omitted. For details of this nature  consult standard reference books on bacteriological technique.          CHAPTER III.    CONTAMINATION OF MILK.      No more important lesson is to be learned than that which relates to the  ways in which milk is contaminated with germ life of various kinds; for  if these sources of infection are thoroughly recognized they can in  large measure be prevented, and so the troubles which they engender  overcome. Various organisms find in milk a congenial field for  development. Yeasts and some fungi are capable of growth, but more  particularly the bacteria.    ~Milk a suitable bacterial food.~ The readiness with which milk undergoes  fermentative changes indicates that it is well adapted to nourish  bacterial life. Not only does it contain all the necessary nutritive  substances but they are diluted in proper proportions so as to render  them available for bacterial as well as mammalian life.    Of the nitrogenous compounds, the albumen is in readily assimilable  form. The casein, being insoluble, is not directly available, until it  is acted upon by proteid-dissolving enzyms like trypsin which may be  secreted by bacteria. The fat is relatively resistant to change,  although a few forms are capable of decomposing it. Milk sugar, however,  is an admirable food for many species, acids and sometimes gases being  generally produced.    ~Condition when secreted.~ When examined under normal conditions milk  always reveals bacterial life, yet in the secreting cells of the udder  of a healthy cow germ life is not found. Only when the gland is diseased  are bacteria found in any abundance. In the passage of the milk from  the secreting cells to the outside it receives its first infection, so  that when drawn from the animal it generally contains a considerable  number of organisms.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. Microscopic appearance of milk showing relative  size of fat globules and bacteria.]    ~Contamination of milk.~ From this time until it is consumed in one form  or another, it is continually subjected to contamination. The major part  of this infection occurs while the milk is on the farm and the degree of  care which is exercised while the product is in the hands of the milk  producer is the determining factor in the course of bacterial changes  involved. This of course does not exclude the possibility of  contamination in the factory, but usually milk is so thoroughly seeded  by the time it reaches the factory that the infection which occurs here  plays a relatively minor role to that which happens earlier. The great  majority of the organisms in milk are in no wise dangerous to health,  but many species are capable of producing various fermentative changes  that injure the quality of the product for butter or cheese. To be able  to control abnormal changes of an undesirable character one must know  the sources of infection which permit of the introduction of these  unwelcome intruders.    ~Sources of infection.~ The bacterial life that finds its way into milk  while it is yet on the farm may be traced to several sources, which may  be grouped under the following heads: unclean dairy utensils, fore milk,  coat of animal, and general atmospheric surroundings. The relative  importance of these various factors fluctuates in each individual  instance.    ~Dairy utensils.~ Of first importance are the vessels that are used during  milking, and also all storage cans and other dairy utensils that come in  contact with the milk after it is drawn. By unclean utensils, actually  _visible_ dirt need not always be considered, although such material is  often present in cracks and angles of pails and cans. Unless cleansed  with especial care, these are apt to be filled with foul and decomposing  material that suffices to seed thoroughly the milk. Tin utensils are  best. Where made with joints, they should be well flushed with solder so  as to be easily cleaned (see Fig. 6). In much of the cheaper tin ware on  the market, the soldering of joints and seams is very imperfect,  affording a place of refuge for bacteria and dirt.    Cans are often used when they are in a condition wholly unsuitable for  sanitary handling of milk. When the tin coating becomes broken and the  can is rusty, the quality of the milk is often profoundly affected.  Olson[1] of the Wisconsin Station has shown that the action of rennet is  greatly impaired where milk comes in contact with a rusty iron surface.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    With the introduction of the form or hand separator a new milk utensil  has been added to those previously in use and one which is very  frequently not well cleaned. Where water is run through the machine to  rinse out the milk particles, gross bacterial contamination occurs and  the use of the machine much increases the germ content of the milk.  Every time the separator is used it should be taken apart and thoroughly  cleaned and dried before reassembling.[2]    ~Use of milk-cans for transporting factory by-products.~ The general  custom of using the milk-cans to carry back to the farm the factory  by-products (skim-milk or whey) has much in it that is to be deprecated.  These by-products are generally rich in bacterial life, more especially  where the closest scrutiny is not given to the daily cleaning of the  vats and tanks. Too frequently the cans are not cleaned immediately upon  arrival at the farm, so that the conditions are favorable for rapid  fermentation. Many of the taints that bother factories are directly  traceable to such a cause. A few dirty patrons will thus seriously  infect the whole supply. The responsibility for this defect should,  however, not be laid entirely upon the shoulders of the producer. The  factory operator should see that the refuse material does not accumulate  in the waste vats from day to day and is not transformed into a more or  less putrid mass. A dirty whey tank is not an especially good object  lesson to the patron to keep his cans clean.    It is possible that abnormal fermentations or even contagious diseases  may thus be disseminated.    Suppose there appears in a dairy an infectious milk trouble, such as  bitter milk. This milk is taken to the factory and passes unnoticed into  the general milk-supply. The skim-milk from the separator is of course  infected with the germ, and if conditions favor its growth, the whole  lot soon becomes tainted. If this waste product is returned to the  different patrons in the same cans that are used for the fresh milk, the  probabilities are strongly in favor of some of the cans being  contaminated and thus infecting the milk supply of the patrons. If the  organism is endowed with spores so that it can withstand unfavorable  conditions, this taint may be spread from patron to patron simply  through the infection of the vessels that are used in the transportation  of the by-products. Connell has reported just such a case in a Canadian  cheese factory where an outbreak of slimy milk was traced to infected  whey vats.

But, however revolting, the case is not  without interest for the reader who is curious about the social life of  the Temple.    The portion of the Temple in which the old-world family life of the Inns  held out the longest, is a clump of commodious houses lying between the  Middle Temple Garden and Essex Street, Strand. Having their  entrance-doors in Essex Street, these houses are, in fact, as private as  the residences of any London quarter. The noise of the Strand reaches  them, but their occupants are as secure from the impertinent gaze or  unwelcome familiarities of law-students and barristers' clerks, as they  would be if they lived at St. John's Wood. In Essex Street, on the  eastern side, the legal families maintained their ground almost till  yesterday. Fifteen years since the writer of this page used to be  invited to dinners and dances in that street--dinners and dances which  were attended by prosperous gentlefolk from the West End of the town. At  that time he often waltzed in a drawing-room, the windows of which  looked upon the spray of the fountain--at which Ruth Pinch loved to gaze  when its jet resembled a wagoner's whip. How all old and precious things  pass away! The dear old 'wagoner's whip' has been replaced by a pert,  perky squirt that will never stir the heart or brain of a future Ruth.    [1] The scandalous state of Gray's Inn at this period is shown by the  following passage in Dugdale's 'Origines:'--\"In 23 Eliz. (30 Jan.) there  was an order made that no laundress, nor women called victuallers,  should thenceforth come into the gentlemen's chambers of this society,  until they were full forty years of age, and not send their  maid-servants, of what age soever, in the said gentlemen's chambers,  upon penalty, for the first offence of him that should admit of any  such, to be put out of Commons: and for the second, to be expelled the  House.\" The stringency and severity of this order show a determination  on the part of the authorities to cure the evil.          Chapter III.    YORK HOUSE AND POWIS HOUSE.      Whilst the great body of lawyers dwelt in or hard by the Inns, the  dignitaries of the judicial bench, and the more eminent members of the  bar, had suitable palaces or mansions at greater or less distances from  the legal hostelries. The ecclesiastical Chancellors usually enjoyed  episcopal or archiepiscopal rank, and lived in the London palaces  attached to their sees or provinces. During his tenure of the seals,  Morton, Bishop of Ely, years before he succeeded to the archbishopric of  Canterbury, and received the honors of the Cardinalate, grew  strawberries in his garden on Holborn Hill, and lived in the palace  surrounded by that garden. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Chancellor  Warham maintained at Lambeth Palace the imposing state commemorated by  Erasmus.    When Wolsey made his first progress to the Court of Chancery in  Westminster Hall, a progress already alluded to in these pages, he  started from the archiepiscopal palace, York House or Place--an official  residence sold by the cardinal to Henry VIII. some years later; and when  the same superb ecclesiastic, towards the close of his career, went on  the memorable embassy to France, he set out from his palace at  Westminster, \"passing through all London over London Bridge, having  before him of gentlemen a great number, three in rank in black velvet  livery coats, and the most of them with great chains of gold about their  necks.\"    At later dates Gardyner, whilst he held the seals, kept his numerous  household at Winchester House in Southwark; and Williams, the last  clerical Lord Keeper, lived at the Deanery, Westminster.    The lay Chancellors also maintained costly and pompous establishments,  apart from the Inns of Court. Sir Thomas More's house stood in the  country, flanked by a garden and farm, in the cultivation of which  ground the Chancellor found one of his chief sources of amusement. In  Aldgate, Lord Chancellor Audley built his town mansion, on the site of  the Priory of the Canons of the Holy Trinity of Christ Church.  Wriothesley dwelt in Holborn at the height of his unsteady fortunes, and  at the time of his death. The infamous but singularly lucky Rich lived  in Great St. Bartholomew's, and from his mansion there wrote to the Duke  of Northumberland, imploring that messengers might be sent to him to  relieve him of the perilous trust of the Great Seal. Christopher Hatton  wrested from the see of Ely the site of Holborn, whereon he built his  magnificent palace. The reluctance with which the Bishop of Ely  surrendered the ground, and the imperious letter by which Elizabeth  compelled the prelate to comply with the wish of her favorite courtier,  form one of the humorous episodes of that queen's reign. Hatton House  rose over the soil which had yielded strawberries to Morton; and of that  house--where the dancing Chancellor received Elizabeth as a visitor, and  in which he died of \"diabetes _and_ grief of mind\"--the memory is  preserved by Hatton Garden, the name of the street where some of our  wealthiest jewelers and gold assayers have places of business.    Public convenience had long suggested the expediency of establishing a  permanent residence for the Chancellors of England, when either by  successive expressions of the royal will, or by the individual choice of  several successive holders of the _Clavis Regni_, a noble palace on the  northern bank of the Thames came to be regarded as the proper domicile  for the Great Seal. York House, memorable as the birthplace of Francis  Bacon, and the scene of his brightest social splendor, demands a brief  notice. Wolsey's 'York House' or Whitehall having passed from the  province of York to the crown, Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York,  established himself in another York House on a site lying between the  Strand and the river. In this palace (formerly leased to the see of  Norwich as a bishop's Inn, and subsequently conferred on Charles Brandon  by Henry VIII.) Heath resided during his Chancellorship; and when, in  consequence of his refusal to take the oath of supremacy, Elizabeth  deprived him of his archbishopric, York House passed into the hands of  her new Lord Keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon. On succeeding to the honors of  the Marble Chair, Hatton did not move from Holborn to the Strand; but  otherwise all the holders of the Great Seal, from Heath to Francis Bacon  inclusive, seem to have occupied York House; Heath, of course, using it  by right as Archbishop of York, and the others holding it under leases  granted by successive archbishops of the northern province. So little is  known of Bromley, apart from the course which he took towards Mary of  Scotland, that the memory of old York House gains nothing of interest  from him. Indeed it has been questioned whether he was one of its  tenants. Puckering, Egerton, and Francis Bacon certainly inhabited it in  succession. On Bacon's fall it was granted to Buckingham, whose desire  to possess the picturesque palace was one of the motives which impelled  him to blacken the great lawyer's reputation. Seized by the Long  Parliament, it was granted to Lord Fairfax. In the following generation  it passed into the hands of the second Duke of Buckingham, who sold  house and precinct for building-ground. The bad memory of the man who  thus for gold surrendered a spot of earth sacred to every scholarly  Englishman is preserved in the names of _George_ Street, _Duke_ Street,  _Villiers_ Street, _Buckingham_ Street.    The engravings commonly sold as pictures of the York House, in which  Lord Bacon kept the seals, are likenesses of the building after it was  pulled about, diminished, and modernized, and in no way whatever  represent the architecture of the original edifice. Amongst the  art-treasures of the University of Oxford, Mr. Hepworth Dixon  fortunately found a rough sketch of the real house, from which sketch  Mr. E.M. Ward drew the vignette that embellishes the title-page of 'The  Story of Lord Bacon's Life.'    After the expulsion of the Great Seal from old York House, it wandered  from house to house, manifesting, however, in its selections of London  quarters, a preference for the grand line of thoroughfare between  Charing Cross and the foot of Ludgate Hill. Escaping from the  Westminster Deanery, where Williams kept it in a box, the _Clavis Regni_  inhabited Durham House, Strand, whilst under Lord Keeper Coventry's  care. Lord Keeper Littleton, until he made his famous ride from London  to York, lived in Exeter House. Clarendon resided in Dorset House,  Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, and subsequently in Worcester House,  Strand, before he removed to the magnificent palace which aroused the  indignation of the public in St. James's Street. The greater and happier  part of his official life was passed in Worcester House. There he held  councils in his bedroom when he was laid up with gout; there King  Charles visited him familiarly, even condescending to be present to the  bedside councils; and there he was established when the Great Fire of  London caused him, in a panic, to send his most valuable furniture to  his Villa at Twickenham. Thanet House, Aldersgate Street, is the  residence with which Shaftesbury, the politician, is most generally  associated; but whilst he was Lord Chancellor he occupied Exeter House,  Strand, formerly the abode of Keeper Littleton. Lord Nottingham slept  with the seals under his pillow in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn  Fields, the same street in which his successor, Lord Guildford, had the  establishment so racily described by his brother, Roger North. And Lord  Jeffreys moving westward, gave noisy dinners in Duke Street,  Westminster, where he opened a court-house that was afterwards  consecrated as a place of worship, and is still known as the"]]]
