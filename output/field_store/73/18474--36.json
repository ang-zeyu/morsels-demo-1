And still he was full of 'satiable  curtiosity! He asked his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, why her eyes were  red, and his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, spanked him with her broad,  broad hoof; and he asked his hairy uncle, the Baboon, why melons tasted  just so, and his hairy uncle, the Baboon, spanked him with his hairy,  hairy paw. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity! He asked  questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or  touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was  full of 'satiable curtiosity!    One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this  'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never  asked before. He asked, 'What does the Crocodile have for dinner?' Then  everybody said, 'Hush!' in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him  immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.    By and by, when that was finished, he came upon Kolokolo Bird sitting  in the middle of a wait-a-bit thorn-bush, and he said, 'My father has  spanked me, and my mother has spanked me; all my aunts and uncles have  spanked me for my 'satiable curtiosity; and still I want to know what  the Crocodile has for dinner!'    Then Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, 'Go to the banks of the  great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees,  and find out.'    That very next morning, when there was nothing left of the Equinoxes,  because the Precession had preceded according to precedent, this  'satiable Elephant's Child took a hundred pounds of bananas (the little  short red kind), and a hundred pounds of sugar-cane (the long purple  kind), and seventeen melons (the greeny-crackly kind), and said to all  his dear families, 'Goodbye. I am going to the great grey-green, greasy  Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to find out what the  Crocodile has for dinner.' And they all spanked him once more for luck,  though he asked them most politely to stop.    Then he went away, a little warm, but not at all astonished, eating  melons, and throwing the rind about, because he could not pick it up.    He went from Graham's Town to Kimberley, and from Kimberley to Khama's  Country, and from Khama's Country he went east by north, eating melons  all the time, till at last he came to the banks of the great grey-green,  greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, precisely as  Kolokolo Bird had said.    Now you must know and understand, O Best Beloved, that till that very  week, and day, and hour, and minute, this 'satiable Elephant's Child had  never seen a Crocodile, and did not know what one was like. It was all  his 'satiable curtiosity.    The first thing that he found was a Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake curled  round a rock.    ''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child most politely, 'but have you seen  such a thing as a Crocodile in these promiscuous parts?'    'Have I seen a Crocodile?' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, in a  voice of dretful scorn. 'What will you ask me next?'    ''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child, 'but could you kindly tell me  what he has for dinner?'    Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake uncoiled himself very quickly  from the rock, and spanked the Elephant's Child with his scalesome,  flailsome tail.    'That is odd,' said the Elephant's Child, 'because my father and my  mother, and my uncle and my aunt, not to mention my other aunt, the  Hippopotamus, and my other uncle, the Baboon, have all spanked me for my  'satiable curtiosity--and I suppose this is the same thing.    So he said good-bye very politely to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake,  and helped to coil him up on the rock again, and went on, a little warm,  but not at all astonished, eating melons, and throwing the rind about,  because he could not pick it up, till he trod on what he thought was  a log of wood at the very edge of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo  River, all set about with fever-trees.    But it was really the Crocodile, O Best Beloved, and the Crocodile  winked one eye--like this!    ''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child most politely, 'but do you happen  to have seen a Crocodile in these promiscuous parts?'    Then the Crocodile winked the other eye, and lifted half his tail out of  the mud; and the Elephant's Child stepped back most politely, because he  did not wish to be spanked again.    'Come hither, Little One,' said the Crocodile. 'Why do you ask such  things?'    ''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child most politely, 'but my father has  spanked me, my mother has spanked me, not to mention my tall aunt, the  Ostrich, and my tall uncle, the Giraffe, who can kick ever so hard, as  well as my broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and my hairy uncle, the Baboon,  and including the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, with the scalesome,  flailsome tail, just up the bank, who spanks harder than any of them;  and so, if it's quite all the same to you, I don't want to be spanked  any more.'    'Come hither, Little One,' said the Crocodile, 'for I am the Crocodile,'  and he wept crocodile-tears to show it was quite true.    Then the Elephant's Child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled  down on the bank and said, 'You are the very person I have been looking  for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for  dinner?'    'Come hither, Little One,' said the Crocodile, 'and I'll whisper.'    Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's  musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose,  which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger  than a boot, though much more useful.    'I think, said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like  this--'I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!'    At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he  said, speaking through his nose, like this, 'Led go! You are hurtig be!'    Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and  said, 'My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly,  pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in  the large-pattern leather ulster' (and by this he meant the Crocodile)  'will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack  Robinson.'    This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always talk.    Then the Elephant's Child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled,  and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile  floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his  tail, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled.    And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's  Child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and  pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his  tail like an oar, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each  pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him  hijjus!    Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through  his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, 'This is too butch for  be!'    Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and  knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's  hind legs, and said, 'Rash and inexperienced traveller, we will now  seriously devote ourselves to a little high tension, because if we do  not, it is my impression that yonder self-propelling man-of-war with  the armour-plated upper deck' (and by this, O Best Beloved, he meant the  Crocodile), 'will permanently vitiate your future career.    That is the way all Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always talk.    So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled;  but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled  hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose  with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.    Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he  was careful to say 'Thank you' to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and  next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool  banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo to  cool.    'What are you doing that for?' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.    ''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child, 'but my nose is badly out of  shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink.    'Then you will have to wait a long time, said the  Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'Some people do not know what is good for  them.'    The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to  shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint.  For, O Best Beloved, you will see and understand that the Crocodile  had pulled it out into a really truly trunk same as all Elephants have  to-day.    At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder,  and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that  fly dead with the end of it.    ''Vantage number one!' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'You  couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little  now.'    Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his  trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his  fore-legs, and stuffed it into his own mouth.    'Vantage number two!' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'You  couldn't have done that with a mear-smear nose. Don't you think the sun  is very hot here?'    'It is,' said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was  doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great  grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a  cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.    'Vanta"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#4)"],[1," proper means may be said to be the cause of gaining all  our ends, and this application of proper means being thus necessary  (even where a thing is destined to happen), it follows that a person who  does nothing will enjoy no happiness.      _Objection 4._    Those who are inclined to think that Artha is the chief object to be  obtained argue thus. Pleasures should not be sought for, because they  are obstacles to the practice of Dharma and Artha, which are both  superior to them, and are also disliked by meritorious persons.  Pleasures also bring a man into distress, and into contact with low  persons; they cause him to commit unrighteous deeds, and produce  impurity in him; they make him regardless of the future, and encourage  carelessness and levity. And lastly, they cause him to be disbelieved by  all, received by none, and despised by everybody, including himself. It  is notorious, moreover, that many men who have given themselves up to  pleasure alone, have been ruined along with their families and  relations. Thus, King Dandakya,[7] of the Bhoja dynasty, carried off a  Brahman's daughter with evil intent, and was eventually ruined and lost  his kingdom. Indra, too, having violated the chastity of Ahalya,[8] was  made to suffer for it. In a like manner the mighty Kichaka,[9] who tried  to seduce Draupadi, and Ravana,[10] who attempted to gain over Sita, were  punished for their crimes. These and many others fell by reason of their  pleasures.      _Answer._    This objection cannot be sustained, for pleasures, being as necessary  for the existence and well being of the body as food, are consequently  equally required. They are, moreover, the results of Dharma and Artha.  Pleasures are, therefore, to be followed with moderation and caution. No  one refrains from cooking food because there are beggars to ask for it,  or from sowing seed because there are deer to destroy the corn when it  is grown up.    Thus a man practising Dharma, Artha and Kama enjoys happiness both in  this world and in the world to come. The good perform those actions in  which there is no fear as to what is to result from them in the next  world, and in which there is no danger to their welfare. Any action  which conduces to the practice of Dharma, Artha and Kama together, or of  any two, or even one of them, should be performed, but an action which  conduces to the practice of one of them at the expense of the remaining  two should not be performed.

ON THE ARTS AND SCIENCES TO BE STUDIED.      Man should study the Kama Sutra and the arts and sciences subordinate  thereto, in addition to the study of the arts and sciences contained in  Dharma and Artha. Even young maids should study this Kama Sutra along  with its arts and sciences before marriage, and after it they should  continue to do so with the consent of their husbands.    Here some learned men object, and say that females, not being allowed to  study any science, should not study the Kama Sutra.    But Vatsyayana is of opinion that this objection does not hold good, for  women already know the practice of Kama Sutra, and that practice is  derived from the Kama Shastra, or the science of Kama itself. Moreover,  it is not only in this but in many other cases that though the practice  of a science is known to all, only a few persons are acquainted with the  rules and laws on which the science is based. Thus the Yadnikas or  sacrificers, though ignorant of grammar, make use of appropriate words  when addressing the different Deities, and do not know how these words  are framed. Again, persons do the duties required of them on auspicious  days, which are fixed by astrology, though they are not acquainted with  the science of astrology. In a like manner riders of horses and  elephants train these animals without knowing the science of training  animals, but from practice only. And similarly the people of the most  distant provinces obey the laws of the kingdom from practice, and  because there is a king over them, and without further reason.[11] And  from experience we find that some women, such as daughters of princes  and their ministers, and public women, are actually versed in the Kama  Shastra.    A female, therefore, should learn the Kama Shastra, or at least a part  of it, by studying its practice from some confidential friend. She  should study alone in private the sixty-four practices that form a part  of the Kama Shastra. Her teacher should be one of the following persons,  viz., the daughter of a nurse brought up with her and already  married,[12] or a female friend who can be trusted in everything, or the  sister of her mother (_i.e._, her aunt), or an old female servant, or a  female beggar who may have formerly lived in the family, or her own  sister, who can always be trusted.    The following are the arts to be studied, together with the Kama  Sutra:--    1. Singing.    2. Playing on musical instruments.    3. Dancing.    4. Union of dancing, singing, and playing instrumental music.    5. Writing and drawing.    6. Tattooing.    7. Arraying and adorning an idol with rice and flowers.    8. Spreading and arraying beds or couches of flowers, or flowers upon  the ground.    9. Colouring the teeth, garments, hair, nails, and bodies, _i.e._,  staining, dyeing, colouring and painting the same.    10. Fixing stained glass into a floor.    11. The art of making beds, and spreading out carpets and cushions for  reclining.    12. Playing on musical glasses filled with water.    13. Storing and accumulating water in aqueducts, cisterns and  reservoirs.    14. Picture making, trimming and decorating.    15. Stringing of rosaries, necklaces, garlands and wreaths.    16. Binding of turbans and chaplets, and making crests and top-knots of  flowers.    17. Scenic representations. Stage playing.    18. Art of making ear ornaments.    19. Art of preparing perfumes and odours.    20. Proper disposition of jewels and decorations, and adornment in  dress.    21. Magic or sorcery.    22. Quickness of hand or manual skill.    23. Culinary art, _i.e._, cooking and cookery.    24. Making lemonades, sherbets, acidulated drinks, and spirituous  extracts with proper flavour and colour.    25. Tailor's work and sewing.    26. Making parrots, flowers, tufts, tassels, bunches, bosses, knobs,  &c., out of yarn or thread.    27. Solution of riddles, enigmas, covert speeches, verbal puzzles and  enigmatical questions.    28. A game, which consisted in repeating verses, and as one person  finished, another person had to commence at once, repeating another  verse, beginning with the same letter with which the last speaker's  verse ended, whoever failed to repeat was considered to have lost, and  to be subject to pay a forfeit or stake of some kind.    29. The art of mimicry or imitation.    30. Reading, including chanting and intoning.    31. Study of sentences difficult to pronounce. It is played as a game  chiefly by women and children, and consists of a difficult sentence  being given, and when repeated quickly, the words are often transposed  or badly pronounced.    32. Practice with sword, single stick, quarter staff, and bow and arrow.    33. Drawing inferences, reasoning or inferring.    34. Carpentry, or the work of a carpenter.    35. Architecture, or the art of building.    36. Knowledge about gold and silver coins, and jewels and gems.    37. Chemistry and mineralogy.    38. Colouring jewels, gems and beads.    39. Knowledge of mines and quarries.    40. Gardening; knowledge of treating the diseases of trees and plants,  of nourishing them, and determining their ages.    41. Art of cock fighting, quail fighting and ram fighting.    42. Art of teaching parrots and starlings to speak.    43. Art of applying perfumed ointments to the body, and of dressing the  hair with unguents and perfumes and braiding it.    44. The art of understanding writing in cypher, and the writing of words  in a peculiar way.    45. The art of speaking by changing the forms of words. It is of various  kinds. Some speak by changing the beginning and end of words, others by  adding unnecessary letters between every syllable of a word, and so on.    46. Knowledge of language and of the vernacular dialects.    47. Art of making flower carriages.    48. Art of framing mystical diagrams, of addressing spells"]]]
