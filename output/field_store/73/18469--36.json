It is attended with  considerable heat during the paroxysm, and generally terminates in a  quarter of a lunation, without any disturbance of the faculties of the  mind. See Class IV. 1. 1. 8.    M. M. Venesection. Emetics. Cathartics. Cool the patient in the hot fit,  and warm him in the cold one. Rest. Torpentia.    2. _Ebrietas._ Drunkenness. By the stimulus of wine or opium the whole  arterial system, as well as every other part of the moving system, is  excited into increased action. All the secretions, and with them the  production of sensorial power itself in the brain, seem to be for a time  increased, with an additional quantity of heat, and of pleasureable  sensation. See Sect. XXI. on this subject. This explains, why at the  commencement of the warm paroxysm of some fevers the patient is in greater  spirits, or vivacity; because, as in drunkenness, the irritative motions  are all increased, and a greater production of sensation is the  consequence, which when in a certain degree, is pleasureable, as in the  diurnal fever of weak people. Sect. XXXVI. 3. 1.    3. _Haemorrhagia arteriosa._ Arterial haemorrhage. Bleeding with a quick,  strong, and full pulse. The haemorrhages from the lungs, and from the nose,  are the most frequent of these; but it sometimes happens, that a small  artery but half divided, or the puncture of a leech, will continue to bleed  pertinaciously.    M. M. Venesection. Cathartic with calomel. Divide the wounded artery. Bind  sponge on the puncture. If coffee or charcoal internally? If air with less  oxygen?    4. _Haemoptoe arteriosa._ Spitting of arterial blood. Blood spit up from  the lungs is florid, because it has just been exposed to the influence of  the air in its passage through the extremities of the pulmonary artery; it  is frothy, from the admixture of air with it in the bronchia. The patients  frequently vomit at the same time from the disagreeable titillation of  blood about the fauces; and are thence liable to believe, that the blood is  rejected from the stomach.    Sometimes an haemoptoe for several successive days returns in gouty persons  without danger, and seems to supply the place of the gouty paroxysms. Is  not the liver always diseased previous to the haemoptoe, as in several  other haemorrhages? See Class I. 2. 1. 9.    M. M. Venesection, a purge, a blister, diluents, torpentia; and afterwards  sorbentia, as the bark, the acid of vitriol, and opium. An emetic is said  to stop a pulmonary haemorrhage, which it may effect, as sickness decreases  the circulation, as is very evident in the great sickness sometimes  produced by too large a dose of digitalis purpurea.    Dr. Rush says, a table spoonful or two of common salt is successful in  haemoptoe; this may be owing to its stimulating the absorbent systems, both  the lymphatic, and the venous. Should the patient respire air with less  oxygen? or be made sick by whirling round in a chair suspended by a rope?  One immersion in cold water, or a sudden sprinkling all over with cold  water, would probably stop a pulmonary haemorrhage. See Sect. XXVII. 1.    5. _Haemorrhagia narium._ _Epistaxis_. Bleeding at the nose in elderly  subjects most frequently attends those, whose livers are enlarged or  inflamed by the too frequent use of fermented liquors.    In boys it occurs perhaps simply from redundancy of blood; and in young  girls sometimes precedes the approach of the catamenia; and then it shews a  disposition contrary to chlorosis; which arises from a deficiency of red  blood.    M. M. It is stopped by plunging the head into cold water, with powdered  salt hastily dissolved in it; or sometimes by lint strewed over with wheat  flour put up the nostrils; or by a solution of steel in brandy applied to  the vessel by means of lint. The cure in other respects as in haemoptoe;  when the bleeding recurs at certain periods, after venesection, and  evacuation by calomel, and a blister, the bark and steel must be given, as  in intermittent fevers. See Section XXVII. 1.           *       *       *       *       *    ORDO I.    _Increased Irritation._    GENUS II.    _With increased Actions of the Secerning System._    These are always attended with increase of partial or of general heat; for  the secreted fluids are not simply separated from the blood, but are new  combinations; as they did not previously exist as such in the blood  vessels. But all new combinations give out heat chemically; hence the  origin of animal heat, which is always increased in proportion to the  secretion of the part affected, or to the general quantity of the  secretions. Nevertheless there is reason to believe, that as we have a  sense purposely to distinguish the presence of greater or less quantities  of heat, as mentioned in Sect. XIV. 6. so we may have certain minute glands  for the secretion of this fluid, as the brain is believed to secrete the  sensorial power, which would more easily account for the instantaneous  production of the blush of shame, and of anger. This subject deserves  further investigation.    SPECIES.    1. _Calor febrilis._ The heat in fevers arises from the increase of some  secretion, either of the natural fluids, as in irritative fevers; or of new  fluids, as in infectious fevers; or of new vessels, as in inflammatory  fevers. The pain of heat is a consequence of the increased extension or  contraction of the fibres exposed to so great a stimulus. See CLASS I. 1.  5. 6.    2. _Rubor febrilis._ Febrile redness. When the cold fit of fever  terminates, and the pulsations of the heart and arteries become strong as  well as quick from the increase of their irritability after their late  quiescence, the blood is impelled forwards into the fine extremities of the  arteries, and the anastomozing capillaries, quicker than the extremities of  the veins can absorb and return it to the heart. Hence the pulse at the  wrist becomes full, as well as quick and strong, and the skin glows with  arterial blood, and the veins become empty and less visible.    In elderly people the force of the heart and arteries becomes less, while  the absorbent power of the veins remains the same; whence the capillary  vessels part with the blood, as soon as it is received, and the skin in  consequence becomes paler; it is also probable, that in more advanced life  some of the finer branches of the arteries coalesce, and become impervious,  and thus add to the opacity of the skin.    3. _Sudor calidus._ Warm sweat may be divided into four varieties,  according to their remote causes. _First_, the perspirable matter is  secreted in as great quantity during the hot fit of fever, as towards the  end of it, when the sweat is seen upon the skin. But during the hot fit the  cutaneous absorbents act also with increased energy, and the exhalation is  likewise increased by the greater heat of the skin; and hence it does not  appear in drops on the surface, but is in part reabsorbed, and in part  dissipated in the atmosphere. But as the mouths of the cutaneous absorbents  are exposed to the cool air or bedclothes; whilst those of the capillary  glands, which secrete the perspirable matter, are exposed to the warmth of  the circulating blood; the former, as soon as the fever-fit begins to  decline, lose their increased action first; and hence the absorption of the  sweat is diminished, whilst the increased secretion of it continues for  some hours afterwards, which occasions it to stand in drops upon the skin.    As the skin becomes cooler, the evaporation of the perspirable matter  becomes less, as well as the absorption of it. And hence the dissipation of  aqueous fluid from the body, and the consequent thirst, are perhaps greater  during the hot fit, than during the subsequent sweat. For the sweats do not  occur, according to Dr. Alexander's experiments, till the skin is cooled  from 112 to 108 degrees of heat; that is, till the paroxysm begins to  decline. From this it appears, that the sweats are not critical to the hot  fit, any more than the hot fit can be called critical to the cold one; but  simply, that they are the natural consequence of the decline of the hot  fit, commencing with the decreased action of the absorbent system, and the  decreased evaporation from the skin. And from hence it may be concluded,  that a fever-fit is not in general an effort of nature to restore health,  as Sydenham considered it, but a necessary consequence of the previous  torpor; and that the causes of fevers would be less detrimental, if the  fever itself could be prevented from existing; as appears in the cool  treatment of the small-pox.    It must be noted that the profuse sweats on the skin are more frequent at  the decline of fever-fits than the copious urine, or loose stools, which  are mentioned below; as the cutaneous absorbents, being exposed to the cool  air, lose their increased action sooner than the urinary or intestinal  absorbents; which open into the warm cavities of the bladder and  intestines; but which are nevertheless often affected by their sympathy  with the cutaneous absorbents. Hence few fevers terminate without a  moisture of the skin; whence arose the fatal practice of forcing sweats by  the external warmth of air or bedclothes in fevers; for external warmth  increases the action of the cutaneous capillaries more than that of the  other secerning vessels; because the latter are habituated to 98 degrees of  heat, the internal warmth of the body; whereas the cutaneous capillaries  being nearer the surface are habitually kept cooler by the contact of the  external air. Sweats thus produced by heat in confined rooms are still more  detrimental; as the air becomes then not only deprived of a part of its  oxygene by frequent respiration, but is loaded with animal effluvia as well  as with moisture, till it can receive no more; and in consequence, while  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27638"],[0,"The 2001 CIA World Factbook (#4)"],[1," project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly  and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it  forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders  economic resources.         Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 125,000 Inuits  of Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental  issues; a panel convenes every three years to determine the focus of  the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of  pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.         metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.         noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.         overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than  it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.         ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.         poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern  with respect to endangered or threatened species.         pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.         potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.         salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water  becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse  process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by  evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.         siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become  clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil  erosion.         slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in  which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for  temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines  at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this  practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is  permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these  conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences  for the environment .         soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity  because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of  pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or  erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce  agricultural products.         soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,  and desertification.         ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic  energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper  atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living  organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in  humans.         water-born diseases - those in which the bacteria survive in, and  is transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.    Environment - international agreements  This entry separates country participation in international  environmental agreements into two levels - party to and signed but not  ratified. Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the  abbreviated form of the full name.    Environmental agreements  This information is presented in Appendix C: Selected International  Environmental Agreements, which includes the name, abbreviation, date  opened for signature, date entered into force, objective, and parties  by category.    Ethnic groups  This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic groups starting with the  largest and normally includes the percent of total population.    Exchange rates  This entry provides the official value of a country's monetary unit at  a given date or over a given period of time, as expressed in units of  local currency per US dollar and as determined by international market  forces or official fiat.    Executive branch  This entry includes several subfields. Chief of state includes the name  and title of the titular leader of the country who represents the state  at official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the  day-to-day activities of the government. Head of government includes  the name and title of the top administrative leader who is designated  to manage the day-to-day activities of the government. For example, in  the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is  the head of government. In the US, the president is both the chief of  state and the head of government. Cabinet includes the official name  for this body of high-ranking advisers and the method for selection of  members. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession  to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.

Fiscal year  This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for a country's  accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar year but  which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for the  calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).    Flag description  This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual  flags or the best information available at the time the entry was  written. The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies  unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and  other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic  Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at the beginning of  the country profile. The flag graphics were produced from actual flags  or the best information available at the time of preparation. The flags  of independent states are used by their dependencies unless there is an  officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not  have flags.    GDP  This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final  goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar  estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power parity  (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more  information.    GDP methodology  In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are  derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than  from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method  involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights,  which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services  produced in a given economy.  The data derived from the PPP method  provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic  strength and well-being between countries.  The division of a GDP  estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in  dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.  Whereas PPP estimates for OECD  countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries  are often rough approximations.  Most of the GDP estimates are based on  extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International  Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan  Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In  contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of  international and domestic financial forces that often have little  relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak  currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically  one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates  may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or  official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January  1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community  (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their  currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of  these countries by half. One important caution:  the proportion of,  say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency  accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts  are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to  estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures.  Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can not be chained  together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in  the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies,  use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national  statistical methods and practices.    GDP - composition by sector  This entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture, industry,  and services to total GDP.    GDP - per capita  This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by  population as of 1 July for the same year.    GDP - real growth rate  This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation  and expressed as a percent."]]]
