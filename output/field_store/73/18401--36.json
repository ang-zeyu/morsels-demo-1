And, conversely, one has almost calculated the whole of the value  of modernity once one is clear concerning what is good and evil in Wagner.  I can perfectly well understand a musician of to-day who says: \"I hate  Wagner but I can endure no other music.\" But I should also understand a  philosopher who said, \"Wagner is modernity in concentrated form.\" There is  no help for it, we must first be Wagnerites.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}          1.      Yesterday--would you believe it?--I heard _Bizet's_ masterpiece for the  twentieth time. Once more I attended with the same gentle reverence; once  again I did not run away. This triumph over my impatience surprises me.  How such a work completes one! Through it one almost becomes a  \"masterpiece\" oneself--And, as a matter of fact, each time I heard _Carmen_  it seemed to me that I was more of a philosopher, a better philosopher  than at other times: I became so forbearing, so happy, so Indian, so  _settled_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} To sit for five hours: the first step to holiness!--May I be  allowed to say that Bizet's orchestration is the only one that I can  endure now? That other orchestration which is all the rage at present--the  Wagnerian--is brutal, artificial and \"unsophisticated\" withal, hence its  appeal to all the three senses of the modern soul at once. How terribly  Wagnerian orchestration affects me! I call it the _Sirocco_. A  disagreeable sweat breaks out all over me. All my fine weather vanishes.    Bizet's music seems to me perfect. It comes forward lightly, gracefully,  stylishly. It is lovable, it does not sweat. \"All that is good is easy,  everything divine runs with light feet\": this is the first principle of my  aesthetics. This music is wicked, refined, fatalistic, and withal remains  popular,--it possesses the refinement of a race, not of an individual. It  is rich. It is definite. It builds, organises, completes, and in this  sense it stands as a contrast to the polypus in music, to \"endless  melody\". Have more painful, more tragic accents ever been heard on the  stage before? And how are they obtained? Without grimaces! Without  counterfeiting of any kind! Free from the _lie_ of the grand style!--In  short: this music assumes that the listener is intelligent even as a  musician,--thereby it is the opposite of Wagner, who, apart from everything  else, was in any case the most _ill-mannered_ genius on earth (Wagner  takes us as if {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} , he repeats a thing so often that we become  desperate,--that we ultimately believe it).    And once more: I become a better man when Bizet speaks to me. Also a  better musician, a better _listener_. Is it in any way possible to listen  better?--I even burrow behind this music with my ears. I hear its very  cause. I seem to assist at its birth. I tremble before the dangers which  this daring music runs, I am enraptured over those happy accidents for  which even Bizet himself may not be responsible.--And, strange to say, at  bottom I do not give it a thought, or am not aware how much thought I  really do give it. For quite other ideas are running through my head the  while.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Has any one ever observed that music _emancipates_ the spirit?  gives wings to thought? and that the more one becomes a musician the more  one is also a philosopher? The grey sky of abstraction seems thrilled by  flashes of lightning; the light is strong enough to reveal all the details  of things; to enable one to grapple with problems; and the world is  surveyed as if from a mountain top--With this I have defined philosophical  pathos--And unexpectedly _answers_ drop into my lap, a small hailstorm of  ice and wisdom, of problems _solved_. Where am I? Bizet makes me  productive. Everything that is good makes me productive. I have gratitude  for nothing else, nor have I any other touchstone for testing what is  good.          2.      Bizet's work also saves; Wagner is not the only \"Saviour.\" With it one  bids farewell to the _damp_ north and to all the fog of the Wagnerian  ideal. Even the action in itself delivers us from these things. From  Merimee it has this logic even in passion, from him it has the direct  line, _inexorable_ necessity, but what it has above all else is that which  belongs to sub-tropical zones--that dryness of atmosphere, that  _limpidezza_ of the air. Here in every respect the climate is altered.  Here another kind of sensuality, another kind of sensitiveness and another  kind of cheerfulness make their appeal. This music is gay, but not in a  French or German way. Its gaiety is African; fate hangs over it, its  happiness is short, sudden, without reprieve. I envy Bizet for having had  the courage of this sensitiveness, which hitherto in the cultured music of  Europe has found no means of expression,--of this southern, tawny, sunburnt  sensitiveness.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} What a joy the golden afternoon of its happiness is to us!  When we look out, with this music in our minds, we wonder whether we have  ever seen the sea so _calm_. And how soothing is this Moorish dancing!  How, for once, even our insatiability gets sated by its lascivious  melancholy!--And finally love, love translated back into _Nature_! Not the  love of a \"cultured girl!\"--no Senta-sentimentality.(7) But love as fate,  as a fatality, cynical, innocent, cruel,--and precisely in this way  _Nature_! The love whose means is war, whose very essence is the _mortal  hatred_ between the sexes!--I know no case in which the tragic irony, which  constitutes the kernel of love, is expressed with such severity, or in so  terrible a formula, as in the last cry of Don Jose with which the work  ends:    \"Yes, it is I who have killed her,  I--my adored Carmen!\"    --Such a conception of love (the only one worthy of a philosopher) is rare:  it distinguishes one work of art from among a thousand others. For, as a  rule, artists are no better than the rest of the world, they are even  worse--they _misunderstand_ love. Even Wagner misunderstood it. They  imagine that they are selfless in it because they appear to be seeking the  advantage of another creature often to their own disadvantage. But in  return they want to _possess_ the other creature.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Even God is no  exception to this rule, he is very far from thinking \"What does it matter  to thee whether I love thee or not?\"--He becomes terrible if he is not  loved in return \"_L'amour_--and with this principle one carries one's point  against Gods and men--_est de tous les sentiments le plus egoiste, et par  consequent, lorsqu'il est blesse, le moins genereux_\" (B. Constant).          3.      Perhaps you are beginning to perceive how very much this music _improves_  me?--_Il faut mediterraniser la musique._ and I have my reasons for this  principle (\"Beyond Good and Evil,\" pp. 216 _et seq._) The return to  Nature, health, good spirits, youth, _virtue_!--And yet I was one of the  most corrupted Wagnerites.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} I was able to take Wagner seriously. Oh, this  old magician! what tricks has he not played upon us! The first thing his  art places in our hands is a magnifying glass: we look through it, and we  no longer trust our own eyes--Everything grows bigger, _even Wagner grows  bigger_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} What a clever rattlesnake. Throughout his life he rattled  \"resignation,\" \"loyalty,\" and \"purity\" about our ears, and he retired from  the _corrupt_ world with a song of praise to chastity!--And we believed it  all.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    --But you will not listen to me? You _prefer_ even the _problem_ of Wagner  to that of Bizet? But neither do I underrate it; it has its charm. The  problem of salvation is even a venerable problem. Wagner pondered over  nothing so deeply as over salvation: his opera is the opera of salvation.  Someone always wants to be saved in his operas,--now it is a youth; anon it  is a maid,--this is _his problem_--And how lavishly he varies his  _leitmotif_! What rare and melancholy modulations! If it were not for  Wagner, who would teach us that innocence has a preference for saving  interesting sinners? (the case in \"Tannhauser\"). Or that even the eternal  Jew gets saved and _settled down_ when he marries? (the case in the  \"Flying Dutchman\"). Or that corrupted old females prefer to be saved by  chaste young men? (the case of Kundry). Or that young hysterics like to be  saved by their doctor? (the case in \"Lohengrin\"). Or that beautiful girls  most love to be saved by a knight who also happens to be a Wagnerite? (the  case in the \"Mastersingers\"). Or that even married women also like to be  saved by a knight? (the case of Isolde). Or that the venerable Almighty,  after having compromised himself morally in all manner of ways, is at last  delivered by a free spirit and an immoralist? (the case in the \"Ring\").  Admire, more especially this last piece of wisdom! Do you understand it?  I--take good care not to understand it.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} That it is possible to draw yet  other lessons from the works above mentioned,--I am much more ready to  prove than to dispute. That one may be driven by a Wagnerian ballet to  desperation--_and_ to virtue! (once again the case in \"Tannhauser\"). That  not going to bed at the right time may be followed by the worst  consequences (once again the case of \"Lohengrin\").--That one can never be  too sure of the spouse one actually marries (for the third time, the case  of \"Lohengrin\"). \"Tristan and Isolde\" glorifies the perfect husband who,  in a certain case, can ask only one question: \"But why have ye not told me  this before? Nothing could be simpler than that!\" Reply:    \"That I cannot tell thee.  And what thou askest,  That wilt thou never learn.\"    \"Lohengrin\" contains a solemn ban upon all investigation and questioning.  In this way Wagner stood for the Christian concept, \"Thou must and shalt  _believe_\".

Besides, it's  pleasant to be able to ask a visitor; our aunt, Mrs. Nixon, for example.  But she is accustomed to have everything very nice.'    'And how much do you want to spend?'    'Well, I hardly think we should be justified in going much beyond ten  pounds. That isn't enough, eh?'    Wilson got up and shut the door of the back kitchen impressively.    'Look here,' he said, 'I'm glad you came to me in the first place. Now  you'll just tell me where you thought of going yourself.'    'Well, I had thought of the Hampstead Road,' said Darnell in a  hesitating manner.    'I just thought you'd say that. But I'll ask you, what is the good of  going to those expensive shops in the West End? You don't get a better  article for your money. You're merely paying for fashion.'    'I've seen some nice things in Samuel's, though. They get a brilliant  polish on their goods in those superior shops. We went there when we  were married.'    'Exactly, and paid ten per cent more than you need have paid. It's  throwing money away. And how much did you say you had to spend? Ten  pounds. Well, I can tell you where to get a beautiful bedroom suite, in  the very highest finish, for six pound ten. What d'you think of that?  China included, mind you; and a square of carpet, brilliant colours,  will only cost you fifteen and six. Look here, go any Saturday afternoon  to Dick's, in the Seven Sisters Road, mention my name, and ask for Mr.  Johnston. The suite's in ash, \"Elizabethan\" they call it. Six pound ten,  including the china, with one of their \"Orient\" carpets, nine by nine,  for fifteen and six. Dick's.'    Wilson spoke with some eloquence on the subject of furnishing. He  pointed out that the times were changed, and that the old heavy style  was quite out of date.    'You know,' he said, 'it isn't like it was in the old days, when people  used to buy things to last hundreds of years. Why, just before the wife  and I were married, an uncle of mine died up in the North and left me  his furniture. I was thinking of furnishing at the time, and I thought  the things might come in handy; but I assure you there wasn't a single  article that I cared to give house-room to. All dingy, old mahogany; big  bookcases and bureaus, and claw-legged chairs and tables. As I said to  the wife (as she was soon afterwards), \"We don't exactly want to set up  a chamber of horrors, do we?\" So I sold off the lot for what I could  get. I must confess I like a cheerful room.'    Darnell said he had heard that artists liked the old-fashioned  furniture.    'Oh, I dare say. The \"unclean cult of the sunflower,\" eh? You saw that  piece in the \"Daily Post\"? I hate all that rot myself. It isn't healthy,  you know, and I don't believe the English people will stand it. But  talking of curiosities, I've got something here that's worth a bit of  money.'    He dived into some dusty receptacle in a corner of the room, and showed  Darnell a small, worm-eaten Bible, wanting the first five chapters of  Genesis and the last leaf of the Apocalypse. It bore the date of 1753.    'It's my belief that's worth a lot,' said Wilson. 'Look at the  worm-holes. And you see it's \"imperfect,\" as they call it. You've  noticed that some of the most valuable books are \"imperfect\" at the  sales?'    The interview came to an end soon after, and Darnell went home to his  tea. He thought seriously of taking Wilson's advice, and after tea he  told Mary of his idea and of what Wilson had said about Dick's.    Mary was a good deal taken by the plan when she had heard all the  details. The prices struck her as very moderate. They were sitting one  on each side of the grate (which was concealed by a pretty cardboard  screen, painted with landscapes), and she rested her cheek on her hand,  and her beautiful dark eyes seemed to dream and behold strange visions.  In reality she was thinking of Darnell's plan.    'It would be very nice in some ways,' she said at last. 'But we must  talk it over. What I am afraid of is that it will come to much more than  ten pounds in the long run. There are so many things to be considered.  There's the bed. It would look shabby if we got a common bed without  brass mounts. Then the bedding, the mattress, and blankets, and sheets,  and counterpane would all cost something.'    She dreamed again, calculating the cost of all the necessaries, and  Darnell stared anxiously; reckoning with her, and wondering what her  conclusion would be. For a moment the delicate colouring of her face,  the grace of her form, and the brown hair, drooping over her ears and  clustering in little curls about her neck, seemed to hint at a language  which he had not yet learned; but she spoke again.    'The bedding would come to a great deal, I am afraid. Even if Dick's are  considerably cheaper than Boon's or Samuel's. And, my dear, we must have  some ornaments on the mantelpiece. I saw some very nice vases at  eleven-three the other day at Wilkin and Dodd's. We should want six at  least, and there ought to be a centre-piece. You see how it mounts up.'    Darnell was silent. He saw that his wife was summing up against his  scheme, and though he had set his heart on it, he could not resist her  arguments.    'It would be nearer twelve pounds than ten,' she said.    'The floor would have to be stained round the carpet (nine by nine, you  said?), and we should want a piece of linoleum to go under the  washstand. And the walls would look very bare without any pictures.'    'I thought about the pictures,' said Darnell; and he spoke quite  eagerly. He felt that here, at least, he was unassailable. 'You know  there's the \"Derby Day\" and the \"Railway Station,\" ready framed,  standing in the corner of the box-room already. They're a bit  old-fashioned, perhaps, but that doesn't matter in a bedroom. And  couldn't we use some photographs? I saw a very neat frame in natural oak  in the City, to hold half a dozen, for one and six. We might put in your  father, and your brother James, and Aunt Marian, and your grandmother,  in her widow's cap--and any of the others in the album. And then there's  that old family picture in the hair-trunk--that might do over the  mantelpiece.'    'You mean your great-grandfather in the gilt frame? But that's _very_  old-fashioned, isn't it? He looks so queer in his wig. I don't think it  would quite go with the room, somehow.'    Darnell thought a moment. The portrait was a 'kitcat' of a young  gentleman, bravely dressed in the fashion of 1750, and he very faintly  remembered some old tales that his father had told him about this  ancestor--tales of the woods and fields, of the deep sunken lanes, and  the forgotten country in the west.    'No,' he said, 'I suppose it is rather out of date. But I saw some very  nice prints in the City, framed and quite cheap.'    'Yes, but everything counts. Well, we will talk it over, as you say. You  know we must be careful.'    The servant came in with the supper, a tin of biscuits, a glass of milk  for the mistress, and a modest pint of beer for the master, with a  little cheese and butter. Afterwards Edward smoked two pipes of  honeydew, and they went quietly to bed; Mary going first, and her  husband following a quarter of an hour later, according to the ritual  established from the first days of their marriage. Front and back doors  were locked, the gas was turned off at the meter, and when Darnell got  upstairs he found his wife already in bed, her face turned round on the  pillow.    She spoke softly to him as he came into the room.    'It would be impossible to buy a presentable bed at anything under one  pound eleven, and good sheets are dear, anywhere.'    He slipped off his clothes and slid gently into bed, putting out the  candle on the table. The blinds were all evenly and duly drawn, but it  was a June night, and beyond the walls, beyond that desolate world and  wilderness of grey Shepherd's Bush, a great golden moon had floated up  through magic films of cloud, above the hill, and the earth was filled  with a wonderful light between red sunset lingering over the mountain  and that marvellous glory that shone into the woods from the summit of  the hill. Darnell seemed to see some reflection of that wizard  brightness in the room; the pale walls and the white bed and his wife's  face lying amidst brown hair upon the pillow were illuminated, and  listening he could almost hear the corncrake in the fields, the fern-owl  sounding his strange note from the quiet of the rugged place where the  bracken grew, and, like the echo of a magic song, the melody of the  nightingale that sang all night in the alder by the little brook. There  was nothing that he could say, but he slowly stole his arm under his  wife's neck, and played with the ringlets of brown hair. She never  moved, she lay there gently breathing, looking up to the blank ceiling  of the room with her beautiful eyes, thinking also, no doubt, thoughts  that she could not utter, kissing her husband obediently when he asked  her to do so, and he stammered and hesitated as he spoke.    They were nearly asleep, indeed Darnell was on the very eve of dreaming,  when she said very softly--    'I am afraid, darling, that we could never afford it.' And he heard her  words through the murmur of the water, dripping from the grey rock, and  falling into the clear pool beneath.    Sunday morning was always an occasion of idleness. Indeed, they would  never have got breakfast if Mrs. Darnell, who had the instincts of the  housewife, had not awoke and seen the bright sunshine, and felt that the  house was too still. She lay quiet for five minutes, while her husband  slept beside her, and listened intently, waiting for the sound of Alice  stirring down below. A golden tube of sunlight shone through some  opening in the Venetian blinds, and it shone on the brown hair that lay  about her head on the pillow, and she looked steadily into the room at  the 'duchesse' "]]]
