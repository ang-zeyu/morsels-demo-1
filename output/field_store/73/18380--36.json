For a women to be beautiful, they say in Spain, she  must fulfil thirty _ifs_, or, if it please you better, you must be able  to define her appearance by ten adjectives, applicable to three portions  of her person.    For instance, three things about her must be black, her eyes, her  eyelashes, and her eyebrows. Three must be dainty, her fingers, her  lips, her hair, and so forth. For the rest of this inventory, see  Brantome. My gipsy girl could lay no claim to so many perfections. Her  skin, though perfectly smooth, was almost of a copper hue. Her eyes  were set obliquely in her head, but they were magnificent and large. Her  lips, a little full, but beautifully shaped, revealed a set of teeth as  white as newly skinned almonds. Her hair--a trifle coarse, perhaps--was  black, with blue lights on it like a raven's wing, long and glossy. Not  to weary my readers with too prolix a description, I will merely add,  that to every blemish she united some advantage, which was perhaps all  the more evident by contrast. There was something strange and wild about  her beauty. Her face astonished you, at first sight, but nobody could  forget it. Her eyes, especially, had an expression of mingled sensuality  and fierceness which I had never seen in any other human glance.  \"Gipsy's eye, wolf's eye!\" is a Spanish saying which denotes close  observation. If my readers have no time to go to the \"Jardin des  Plantes\" to study the wolf's expression, they will do well to watch the  ordinary cat when it is lying in wait for a sparrow.    It will be understood that I should have looked ridiculous if I had  proposed to have my fortune told in a _cafe_. I therefore begged the  pretty witch's leave to go home with her. She made no difficulties  about consenting, but she wanted to know what o'clock it was again, and  requested me to make my repeater strike once more.    \"Is it really gold?\" she said, gazing at it with rapt attention.    When we started off again, it was quite dark. Most of the shops were  shut, and the streets were almost empty. We crossed the bridge over the  Guadalquivir, and at the far end of the suburb we stopped in front of  a house of anything but palatial appearance. The door was opened by a  child, to whom the gipsy spoke a few words in a language unknown to me,  which I afterward understood to be _Romany_, or _chipe calli_--the gipsy  idiom. The child instantly disappeared, leaving us in sole possession of  a tolerably spacious room, furnished with a small table, two stools, and  a chest. I must not forget to mention a jar of water, a pile of oranges,  and a bunch of onions.    As soon as we were left alone, the gipsy produced, out of her chest,  a pack of cards, bearing signs of constant usage, a magnet, a dried  chameleon, and a few other indispensable adjuncts of her art. Then she  bade me cross my left hand with a silver coin, and the magic ceremonies  duly began. It is unnecessary to chronicle her predictions, and as for  the style of her performance, it proved her to be no mean sorceress.    Unluckily we were soon disturbed. The door was suddenly burst open,  and a man, shrouded to the eyes in a brown cloak, entered the room,  apostrophizing the gipsy in anything but gentle terms. What he said I  could not catch, but the tone of his voice revealed the fact that he was  in a very evil temper. The gipsy betrayed neither surprise nor anger  at his advent, but she ran to meet him, and with a most striking  volubility, she poured out several sentences in the mysterious language  she had already used in my presence. The word _payllo_, frequently  reiterated, was the only one I understood. I knew that the gipsies use  it to describe all men not of their own race. Concluding myself to be  the subject of this discourse, I was prepared for a somewhat delicate  explanation. I had already laid my hand on the leg of one of the stools,  and was studying within myself to discover the exact moment at which I  had better throw it at his head, when, roughly pushing the gipsy to one  side, the man advanced toward me. Then with a step backward he cried:    \"What, sir! Is it you?\"    I looked at him in my turn and recognised my friend Don Jose. At that  moment I did feel rather sorry I had saved him from the gallows.    \"What, is it you, my good fellow?\" I exclaimed, with as easy a smile as  I could muster. \"You have interrupted this young lady just when she was  foretelling me most interesting things!\"    \"The same as ever. There shall be an end to it!\" he hissed between his  teeth, with a savage glance at her.    Meanwhile the _gitana_ was still talking to him in her own tongue. She  became more and more excited. Her eyes grew fierce and bloodshot,  her features contracted, she stamped her foot. She seemed to me to be  earnestly pressing him to do something he was unwilling to do. What this  was I fancied I understood only too well, by the fashion in which she  kept drawing her little hand backward and forward under her chin. I was  inclined to think she wanted to have somebody's throat cut, and I had a  fair suspicion the throat in question was my own. To all her torrent of  eloquence Don Jose's only reply was two or three shortly spoken words.  At this the gipsy cast a glance of the most utter scorn at him, then,  seating herself Turkish-fashion in a corner of the room, she picked out  an orange, tore off the skin, and began to eat it.    Don Jose took hold of my arm, opened the door, and led me into the  street. We walked some two hundred paces in the deepest silence. Then he  stretched out his hand.    \"Go straight on,\" he said, \"and you'll come to the bridge.\"    That instant he turned his back on me and departed at a great pace. I  took my way back to my inn, rather crestfallen, and considerably out  of temper. The worst of all was that, when I undressed, I discovered my  watch was missing.    Various considerations prevented me from going to claim it next day, or  requesting the _Corregidor_ to be good enough to have a search made  for it. I finished my work on the Dominican manuscript, and went on  to Seville. After several months spent wandering hither and thither in  Andalusia, I wanted to get back to Madrid, and with that object I had to  pass through Cordova. I had no intention of making any stay there, for  I had taken a dislike to that fair city, and to the ladies who bathed  in the Guadalquivir. Nevertheless, I had some visits to pay, and certain  errands to do, which must detain me several days in the old capital of  the Mussulman princes.    The moment I made my appearance in the Dominican convent, one of the  monks, who had always shown the most lively interest in my inquiries  as to the site of the battlefield of Munda, welcomed me with open arms,  exclaiming:    \"Praised be God! You are welcome! My dear friend. We all thought you  were dead, and I myself have said many a _pater_ and _ave_ (not that I  regret them!) for your soul. Then you weren't murdered, after all? That  you were robbed, we know!\"    \"What do you mean?\" I asked, rather astonished.    \"Oh, you know! That splendid repeater you used to strike in the library  whenever we said it was time for us to go into church. Well, it has been  found, and you'll get it back.\"    \"Why,\" I broke in, rather put out of countenance, \"I lost it--\"    \"The rascal's under lock and key, and as he was known to be a man who  would shoot any Christian for the sake of a _peseta_, we were  most dreadfully afraid he had killed you. I'll go with you to the  _Corregidor_, and he'll give you back your fine watch. And after that,  you won't dare to say the law doesn't do its work properly in Spain.\"    \"I assure you,\" said I, \"I'd far rather lose my watch than have to  give evidence in court to hang a poor unlucky devil, and especially  because--because----\"    \"Oh, you needn't be alarmed! He's thoroughly done for; they might hang  him twice over. But when I say hang, I say wrong. Your thief is an  _Hidalgo_. So he's to be garrotted the day after to-morrow, without  fail.* So you see one theft more or less won't affect his position.  Would to God he had done nothing but steal! But he has committed several  murders, one more hideous than the other.\"         * In 1830, the noble class still enjoyed this privilege.       Nowadays, under the constitutional _regime_, commoners have       attained the same dignity.    \"What's his name?\"    \"In this country he is only known as Jose Navarro, but he has another  Basque name, which neither your nor I will ever be able to pronounce.  By the way, the man is worth seeing, and you, who like to study the  peculiar features of each country, shouldn't lose this chance of noting  how a rascal bids farewell to this world in Spain. He is in jail, and  Father Martinez will take you to him.\"    So bent was my Dominican friend on my seeing the preparations for this  \"neat little hanging job\" that I was fain to agree. I went to see the  prisoner, having provided myself with a bundle of cigars, which I hoped  might induce him to forgive my intrusion.    I was ushered into Don Jose's presence just as he was sitting at table.  He greeted me with a rather distant nod, and thanked me civilly for the  present I had brought him. Having counted the cigars in the bundle I  had placed in his hand, he took out a certain number and returned me the  rest, remarking that he would not need any more of them.    I inquired whether by laying out a little money, or by applying to  my friends, I might not be able to do something to soften his lot. He  shrugged his shoulders, to begin with, smiling sadly. Soon, as by an  after-thought, he asked me to have a mass said for the repose of his  soul.    Then he added nervously: \"Would you--would you have another said for a  person who did you a wrong?\"    \"Assuredly I will, my dear fellow,\" I answered. \"But no one in this  country has wronged me so far as I know.\"    He took my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#4)"],[1,"it were not  over 90?  Angelo would not hear of anything of the kind; we must think of  something less complicated.  It would never have occurred to him to read  for Metaphysics under M and for China under C, and combine the  information into the article that appeared in the _Eatanswill Gazette_ as  a review of a work on Chinese Metaphysics.  He asked if I had not lately  had \"una disgrazia qualunque.\"  I reminded him of the theft of our fish,  but that did not satisfy him, he considered it too trivial, though he had  made enough fuss about it at the time, and 17, which in Sicily is one of  the numbers for an ordinary misfortune, was too general.  It seemed a  pity I had not been involved in the fall of a balcony because that was a  very good thing to bet on and he knew it had a number, although he did  not remember it at the moment.  Filippo, the hunchback, was no use  because, though it is fortunate to meet hunchbacks, and of course they  have a number, there was nothing remarkable in seeing Filippo at the  caserma--he is always there.    By this time we had reached Castelvetrano, and supper overshadowed the  lottery.  Angelo cooked everything; we began with maccaroni, after which  we ate the fish and the sparrows, and wound up with the rabbit.  It was  all very good, but it seemed hardly right to eat the sparrows, besides,  there was scarcely as much on one of them as there had been on one of the  artichokes at the caserma.    During supper, something--it may have been the sparrows or, perhaps, the  Madonna again--inspired me with an idea for a number that met with  Angelo's enthusiastic approval.  I remembered that my birthday was near  and proposed to put my money upon the number of that day of the month.  Nothing could have been better and he recommended me to take also my age,  that would give me two numbers and I could have an ambo, I should not win  on a single number unless it came out first, whereas, if I did not  specify their positions, my two numbers might come out anywhere and if  they did I should win about 250 francs.  Angelo accepted as a good omen  the fact that neither of my numbers exceeded 90, and next morning we  called on his cousin and put a franc on 27 and 52.    Now, a lottery is an immoral thing, accordingly I expected to feel as  though I had committed an immoral action, instead of which I felt just as  I usually do.  I, therefore, gave my ticket to Angelo in order that, if I  should develop a conscience by the time the numbers came out, I might  silence it by the consciousness of having disclaimed all hope of gain.  This was perhaps a little cowardly, for the effects of a lottery are said  to be most pernicious to those who win.  But no harm was done in the end,  the actual numbers drawn the following Saturday being 39, 42, 89, 83, 28,  so Angelo lost and likewise the brigadier and the corporal and the guards  who had put their money on 33.          CASTELLINARIA      CHAPTER II--PEPPINO      The train passed through the tunnel under the headland on which stands  the Albergo Belvedere, and steamed into the station of Castellinaria, a  town that is not so marked on any map of Sicily.  I had written to  Carmelo to meet the train and drive me up, but he was not among the  coachmen.  I recognized his brother, and said to him--    \"Hullo! Rosario, where have you been all these years?\"    \"Well, you see,\" he replied, \"I have been away.  First there was the  military service and then I had a disgrazia; but I have come back now.\"    I avoided inquiring into the disgrazia till I could ascertain from some  one else whether he meant what we should call a misfortune or something  more serious and merely said I was glad it was all over and asked after  his brother.    \"Carmelo is quite well--he is in private service.  He told me to meet you  and sent you his salutes and apologies for not coming himself; he will  call on you this evening.\"    \"At the Albergo Belvedere?\"    \"No, excuse me, the Belvedere is closed; he told me to take you to the  Albergo della Madonna, unless you wish to go anywhere else.\"    So Rosario drove me with my luggage up the zigzags for an hour and a half  through dust and sunshine, past orchards of lemons and oranges, among  prickly pears and agave overgrown with pink and red geranium, by rocky  slopes of mesembryanthemum, yellow marguerites, broom and sweet peas,  between white walls with roses straggling over them and occasional  glimpses of the sea dotted with fishing boats and, now and then, of the  land covered with olives, almonds, and vines.    We stopped in the corso at the Albergo della Madonna (con giardino) and  were received by a young man who introduced himself as Peppino, the son  of the landlord.  He also said he remembered me, that he had been a  waiter in a restaurant in Holborn where I used to dine; I did not  recognize him, though, of course, I did not say so.  There was something  in his manner as though he had recently been assured by my banker that  the balance to my credit during the last ten years or so had never fallen  below a much larger sum than my passbook had been in the habit of  recording.  He would not hear of my doing anything about my luggage or  dinner, he knew my ways and would show me to my room at once.  It was a  very fine room with two beds, and he promised that no one should be put  into the second bed, not even during the festa which in a few days would  fill the town with pilgrims.  He then departed to bring up my luggage and  I went out on to the balcony.    Before me lay one of those stupendous panoramas which are among the  glories of Sicily.  First a garden of flowers with orange and lemon trees  whose blossoms scented the air, then a thicket of almonds full of  glittering goldfinches, then a drop of several hundred feet; beyond, to  the right, a great mountain with snow on its rocky summit, its lower  slopes and the intervening country highly cultivated; to the left the  sea, an illimitable opal gleaming in the sunset.  Between the mountain  and the sea the coastline went in and out, in and out, in a succession of  bays and promontories that receded and receded until sea and land and sky  were blended into one distant haze.  Across the first bay was the port  and, as the dusk deepened, constellations of lights gathered and glowed  among the shipping.  I took possession, thinking that if, like Peppino's  parents, I might spend my declining days here, the troubles of life, and  especially those attendant upon old age, might be easier to bear.  And  yet, possibly, a stupendous panorama might turn out as deceitful as  proficiency at whist, or great riches, or worldly honours, or any of the  other adjuncts of age popularly supposed to be desirable; for I suspect  that most of these things fail and become as naught in the balance when  weighed against a good digestion, a modest competency and a quiet  conscience.  These are the abiding securities that smooth our passage  through life and bring a man peace at the last, and each of us has his  own way of going about to win them.    Peppino brought my luggage and, with no nonsense about what I would have  for dinner or when or where I should like it, told me that it would be  ready at 7.30 in the garden.  Accordingly I went down punctually and  found a table spread under a trellis of vines from which hung an electric  light.  Peppino waited on me as, according to his account, he used to do  in London, and entertained me with reminiscences of his life there.  He  had attended divine service at St. Paul's, which he called il Duomo di  Londra, and had found it a more reverent function, though less emotional,  than Mass at home.  He was enthusiastic about the river Thames, the  orators in Hyde Park and the shiny soldiers riding in the streets.  He  remembered the lions in the Zoological Gardens and the \"Cock\" at  Highbury, where he once drank a whisky-soda and disliked it intensely.  He had stood on the base of La Torre del Duca di Bronte (by which he  meant the Nelson Column) to see the Lord Mayor's Show, and considered it  far finer than any Sicilian procession--more poetical in conception, he  said, and carried out with greater magnificence.  He had been to Brighton  from Saturday to Monday and burst into tears when he saw the sea again.  It is difficult to travel on the Underground Railway without losing  oneself, but Peppino can do it.  He got lost once, but that was in some  street near Covent Garden, soon after his arrival, and before he had  ventured alone in the Underground; he asked his way of a policeman who  spoke Italian and told him the way: he believes that all London policemen  speak Italian, but he himself prefers English if he can get a chance to  speak it.    Sicilians always want to speak English, especially those of the lower  orders who invariably consider it as a master-key that will open every  door leading to wealth.  Sometimes what they say is, of course, nothing  more than otiose compliment; sometimes they are merely introducing the  subject of their want of money in an artistic manner in the hope of  anything from a soldo to a promise to take them into service as valet,  courier, coachman, or whatever it may be--a sort of shaking of Fortune's  bag to see what will come out.  Sometimes they really do want to learn  English and some of them even make attempts to pick up a few words and  actually retain them.    I went once from Siracusa to Malta at the end of December; it was  abominably rough, and my luggage was thrown about in the cabin with such  violence that some of the things slipped out of my bag.  I was too  sea-sick to be sure I had picked them all up, but afterwards discovered  that the only thing left behind was my new diary for the next year.  On  returning from Valletta to Siracusa about a fortnight later, I asked the  steward if he had found my diary and it was produced by the cabin-boy who  must have been a youth of considerable energy and"]]]
