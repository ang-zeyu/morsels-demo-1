One day late in summer he sighted a stranger on his land, a glossy  Blackbear, and he felt furious against the interloper. As the Blackbear  came nearer Wahb noticed the tan-red face, the white spot on his breast,  and then the bit out of his ear, and last of all the wind brought a whiff.  There could be no further doubt it was the very smell: this was the black  coward that had chased him down the Piney long ago. But how he had  shrunken! Before, he had looked like a giant; now Wahb felt he could crush  him with one paw. Revenge is sweet, Wahb felt, though he did not exactly  say it, and he went for that red-nosed Bear. But the Black one went up a  small tree like a Squirrel. Wahb tried to follow as the other once followed  him, but somehow he could not. He did not seem to know how to take hold  now, and after a while he gave it up and went away, although the Blackbear  brought him back more than once by coughing in derision. Later on that day,  when the Grizzly passed again, the red-nosed one had gone.        [Illustration]    As the summer waned, the upper forage-grounds began to give out, and Wahb  ventured down to the Lower Meteetsee one night to explore. There was a  pleasant odor on the breeze, and following it up, Wahb came to the carcass  of a Steer. A good distance away from it were some tiny Coyotes, mere  dwarfs compared with those he remembered. Right by the carcass was another  that jumped about in the moonlight in a foolish way. For some strange  reason it seemed unable to get away. Wahb's old hatred broke out. He rushed  up. In a flash the Coyote bit him several times before, with one blow of  that great paw, Wahb smashed him into a limp, furry rag; then broke in all  his ribs with a crunch or two of his jaws. Oh, but it was good to feel the  hot, bloody juices oozing between his teeth!        [Illustration]    The Coyote was caught in a trap. Wahb hated the smell of the iron, so he  went to the other side of the carcass, where it was not so strong, and had  eaten but little before _clank_, and his foot was caught in a Wolf-trap  that he had not seen.        [Illustration]    But he remembered that he had once before been caught and had escaped by  squeezing the trap. He set a hind foot on each spring and pressed till the  trap opened and released his paw. About the carcass was the smell that he  knew stood for man, so he left it and wandered down-stream; but more and  more often he got whiffs of that horrible odor, so he turned and went back  to his quiet pinon benches.              PART II        THE DAYS OF HIS STRENGTH        [Illustration]              I      Wahb's third summer had brought him the stature of a large-sized Bear,  though not nearly the bulk and power that in time were his. He was very  light-colored now, and this was why Spahwat, a Shoshone Indian who more  than once hunted him, called him the Whitebear, or Wahb.    Spahwat was a good hunter, and as soon as he saw the rubbing-tree on the  Upper Meteetsee he knew that he was on the range of a big Grizzly. He  bushwhacked the whole valley, and spent many days before he found a chance  to shoot; then Wahb got a stinging flesh-wound in the shoulder. He growled  horribly, but it had seemed to take the fight out of him; he scrambled up  the valley and over the lower hills till he reached a quiet haunt, where he  lay down.        [Illustration]    His knowledge of healing was wholly instinctive. He licked the wound and  all around it, and sought to be quiet. The licking removed the dirt, and by  massage reduced the inflammation, and it plastered the hair down as a sort  of dressing over the wound to keep out the air, dirt, and microbes. There  could be no better treatment.        [Illustration]    But the Indian was on his trail. Before long the smell warned Wahb that a  foe was coming, so he quietly climbed farther up the mountain to another  resting-place. But again he sensed the Indian's approach, and made off.  Several times this happened, and at length there was a second shot and  another galling wound. Wahb was furious now. There was nothing that really  frightened him but that horrible odor of man, iron, and guns, that he  remembered from the day when he lost his Mother; but now all fear of these  left him. He heaved painfully up the mountain again, and along under a  six-foot ledge, then up and back to the top of the bank, where he lay  flat. On came the Indian, armed with knife and gun; deftly, swiftly keeping  on the trail; gloating joyfully over each bloody print that meant such  anguish to the hunted Bear. Straight up the slide of broken rock he came,  where Wahb, ferocious with pain, was waiting on the ledge. On sneaked the  dogged hunter; his eye still scanned the bloody slots or swept the woods  ahead, but never was raised to glance above the ledge. And Wahb, as he saw  this shape of Death relentless on his track, and smelled the hated smell,  poised his bulk at heavy cost upon his quivering, mangled arm, there held  until the proper instant came, then to his sound arm's matchless native  force he added all the weight of desperate hate as down he struck one  fearful, crushing blow. The Indian sank without a cry, and then dropped out  of sight. Wahb rose, and sought again a quiet nook where he might nurse his  wounds. Thus he learned that one must fight for peace; for he never saw  that Indian again, and he had time to rest and recover.        [Illustration: \"HE STRUCK ONE FEARFUL, CRUSHING BLOW.\"]        [Illustration]              II      The years went on as before, except that each winter Wahb slept less  soundly, and each spring he came out earlier and was a bigger Grizzly, with  fewer enemies that dared to face him. When his sixth year came he was a  very big, strong, sullen Bear, with neither friendship nor love in his life  since that evil day on the Lower Piney.        [Illustration]    No one ever heard of Wahb's mate. No one believes that he ever had one.  The love-season of Bears came and went year after year, but left him alone  in his prime as he had been in his youth. It is not good for a Bear to be  alone; it is bad for him in every way. His habitual moroseness grew with  his strength, and any one chancing to meet him now would have called him a  dangerous Grizzly.        [Illustration]    He had lived in the Meteetsee Valley since first he betook himself there,  and his character had been shaped by many little adventures with traps and  his wild rivals of the mountains. But there was none of the latter that he  now feared and he knew enough to avoid the first, for that penetrating odor  of man and iron was a never-failing warning, especially after an  experience which befell him in his sixth year.    His ever-reliable nose told him that there was a dead Elk down among the  timber.        [Illustration]    He went up the wind, and there, sure enough, was the great delicious  carcass, already torn open at the very best place. True, there was that  terrible man-and-iron taint, but it was so slight and the feast so tempting  that after circling around and inspecting the carcass from his eight feet  of stature, as he stood erect, he went cautiously forward, and at once was  caught by his left paw in an enormous Bear-trap. He roared with pain and  slashed about in a fury. But this was no Beaver-trap; it was a big  forty-pound Bear-catcher, and he was surely caught.        [Illustration]    Wahb fairly foamed with rage, and madly grit his teeth upon the trap. Then  he remembered his former experiences. He placed the trap between his hind  legs, with a hind paw on each spring, and pressed down with all his weight.  But it was not enough. He dragged off the trap and its clog, and went  clanking up the mountain. Again and again he tried to free his foot, but in  vain, till he came where a great trunk crossed the trail a few feet from  the ground. By chance, or happy thought, he reared again under this and  made a new attempt. With a hind foot on each spring and his mighty  shoulders underneath the tree, he bore down with his titanic strength: the  great steel springs gave way, the jaws relaxed, and he tore out his foot.  So Wahb was free again, though he left behind a great toe which had been  nearly severed by the first snap of the steel.        [Illustration]    Again Wahb had a painful wound to nurse, and as he was a left-handed  Bear,--that is, when he wished to turn a rock over he stood on the right  paw and turned with the left,--one result of this disablement was to rob  him for a time of all those dainty foods that are found under rocks or  logs. The wound healed at last, but he never forgot that experience, and  thenceforth the pungent smell of man and iron, even without the gun smell,  never failed to enrage him.    Many experiences had taught him that it is better to run if he only smelled  the hunter or heard him far away, but to fight desperately if the man was  close at hand. And the cow-boys soon came to know that the Upper Meteetsee  was the range of a Bear that was better let alone.              III      One day after a long absence Wahb came into the lower part of his range,  and saw to his surprise one of the wooden dens that men make for  themselves. As he came around to get the wind, he sensed the taint that  never failed to infuriate him now, and a moment later he heard a loud  _bang_ and felt a stinging shock in his left hind leg, the old stiff leg.  He wheeled about, in time to see a man running toward the new-made shanty.  Had the shot been in his shoulder Wahb would have been helpless, but it was  not.                      *       *       *       *       *    Mighty arms that could toss pine logs like broomsticks, paws that with one  tap could crush the biggest Bull upon the range,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2503"],[0,"Myths and Legends of California and the Old Southwest (#4)"],[1,"step he reached the earth.    The sun shone through the hole in the sky and began to melt the ice and  snow. It made holes in the ice and snow. When it was soft, Chareya bored  with his finger into the earth, here and there, and planted the first  trees. Streams from the melting snow watered the new trees and made them  grow. Then he gathered the leaves which fell from the trees and blew  upon them. They became birds. He took a stick and broke it into pieces.  Out of the small end he made fishes and placed them in the mountain  streams. Of the middle of the stick, he made all the animals except the  grizzly bear. From the big end of the stick came the grizzly bear, who  was made master of all. Grizzly was large and strong and cunning. When  the earth was new he walked upon two feet and carried a large club. So  strong was Grizzly that Old Man Above feared the creature he had made.  Therefore, so that he might be safe, Chareya hollowed out the pyramid of  ice and snow as a tepee. There he lived for thousands of snows. The  Indians knew he lived there because they could see the smoke curling  from the smoke hole of his tepee. When the pale-face came, Old Man Above  went away. There is no longer any smoke from the smoke hole. White men  call the tepee Mount Shasta.          The Search for the Middle and the Hardening of the World  Zuni (New Mexico)    As it was with the first men and creatures, so it was with the world. It  was young and unripe. Earthquakes shook the world and rent it. Demons  and monsters of the under-world fled forth. Creatures became fierce,  beasts of prey, and others turned timid, becoming their quarry.  Wretchedness and hunger abounded and black magic. Fear was everywhere  among them, so the people, in dread of their precious possessions,  became wanderers, living on the seeds of grass, eaters of dead and slain  things. Yet, guided by the Beloved Twain, they sought in the light and  under the pathway of the Sun, the Middle of the world, over which alone  they could find the earth at rest(1).    When the tremblings grew still for a time, the people paused at the  First of Sitting Places. Yet they were still poor and defenceless and  unskilled, and the world still moist and unstable. Demons and monsters  fled from the earth in times of shaking, and threatened wanderers.    Then the Two took counsel of each other. The Elder said the earth must  be made more stable for men and the valleys where their children rested.  If they sent down their fire bolts of thunder, aimed to all the four  regions, the earth would heave up and down, fire would, belch over the  world and burn it, floods of hot water would sweep over it, smoke would  blacken the daylight, but the earth would at last be safer for men.    So the Beloved Twain let fly the thunderbolts.    The mountains shook and trembled, the plains cracked and crackled under  the floods and fires, and the hollow places, the only refuge of men and  creatures, grew black and awful. At last thick rain fell, putting out  the fires. Then water flooded the world, cutting deep trails through the  mountains, and burying or uncovering the bodies of things and beings.  Where they huddled together and were blasted thus, their blood gushed  forth and flowed deeply, here in rivers, there in floods, for gigantic  were they. But the blood was charred and blistered and blackened by the  fires into the black rocks of the lower mesas(2). There were vast plains  of dust, ashes, and cinders, reddened like the mud of the hearth place.  Yet many places behind and between the mountain terraces were unharmed  by the fires, and even then green grew the trees and grasses and even  flowers bloomed. Then the earth became more stable, and drier, and its  lone places less fearsome since monsters of prey were changed to rock.    But ever and again the earth trembled and the people were troubled.    \"Let us again seek the Middle,\" they said. So they travelled far  eastward to their second stopping place, the Place of Bare Mountains.    Again the world rumbled, and they travelled into a country to a place  called Where-tree-boles-stand-in-the-midst-of-waters. There they  remained long, saying, \"This is the Middle.\" They built homes there. At  times they met people who had gone before, and thus they learned war.  And many strange things happened there, as told in speeches of the  ancient talk.    Then when the earth groaned again, the Twain bade them go forth, and  they murmured. Many refused and perished miserably in their own homes,  as do rats in falling trees, or flies in forbidden food.    But the greater number went forward until they came to  Steam-mist-in-the-midst-of-waters. And they saw the smoke of men's  hearth fires and many houses scattered over the hills before them. When  they came nearer, they challenged the people rudely, demanding who they  were and why there, for in their last standing-place they had had touch  of war.    \"We are the People of the Seed,\" said the men of the hearth-fires, \"born  elder brothers of ye, and led of the gods.\"    \"No,\" said our fathers, \"we are led of the gods and we are the Seed  People...\"    Long lived the people in the town on the sunrise slope of the mountains  of Kahluelawan, until the earth began to groan warningly again. Loath  were they to leave the place of the Kaka and the lake of their dead. But  the rumbling grew louder and the Twain Beloved called, and all together  they journeyed eastward, seeking once more the Place of the Middle. But  they grumbled amongst themselves, so when they came to a place of great  promise, they said, \"Let us stay here. Perhaps it may be the Place of  the Middle.\"    So they built houses there, larger and stronger than ever before, and  more perfect, for they were strong in numbers and wiser, though yet  unperfected as men. They called the place \"The Place of Sacred  Stealing.\"    Long they dwelt there, happily, but growing wiser and stronger, so that,  with their tails and dressed in the skins of animals, they saw they were  rude and ugly.    In chase or in war, they were at a disadvantage, for they met older  nations of men with whom they fought. No longer they feared the gods and  monsters, but only their own kind. So therefore the gods called a  council.    \"Changed shall ye be, oh our children,\" cried the Twain. \"Ye shall walk  straight in the pathways, clothed in garments, and without tails, that  ye may sit more straight in council, and without webs to your feet, or  talons on your hands.\"    So the people were arranged in procession like dancers. And the Twain  with their weapons and fires of lightning shored off the forelocks  hanging down over their faces, severed the talons, and slitted the  webbed fingers and toes. Sore was the wounding and loud cried the  foolish, when lastly the people were arranged in procession for the  razing of their tails.    But those who stood at the end of the line, shrinking farther and  farther, fled in their terror, climbing trees and high places, with loud  chatter. Wandering far, sleeping ever in tree tops, in the far-away  Summerland, they are sometimes seen of far-walkers, long of tail and  long handed, like wizened men-children.    But the people grew in strength, and became more perfect, and more than  ever went to war. They grew vain. They had reached the Place of the  Middle. They said, \"Let us not wearily wander forth again even though  the earth tremble and the Twain bid us forth.\"    And even as they spoke, the mountain trembled and shook, though  far-sounding.    But as the people changed, changed also were the Twain, small and  misshapen, hard-favored and unyielding of will, strong of spirit, evil  and bad. They taught the people to war, and led them far to the  eastward.    At last the people neared, in the midst of the plains to the eastward,  great towns built in the heights. Great were the fields and possessions  of this people, for they knew how to command and carry the waters,  bringing new soil. And this, too, without hail or rain. So our ancients,  hungry with long wandering for new food, were the more greedy and often  gave battle.    It was here that the Ancient Woman of the Elder People, who carried her  heart in her rattle and was deathless of wounds in the body, led the  enemy, crying out shrilly. So it fell out ill for our fathers. For,  moreover, thunder raged and confused their warriors, rain descended and  blinded them, stretching their bow strings of sinew and quenching the  flight of their arrows as the flight of bees is quenched by the  sprinkling plume of the honey-hunter. But they devised bow strings of  yucca and the Two Little Ones sought counsel of the Sun-father who  revealed the life-secret of the Ancient Woman and the magic powers over  the under-fires of the dwellers of the mountains, so that our enemy in  the mountain town was overmastered. And because our people found in that  great town some hidden deep in the cellars, and pulled them out as rats  are pulled from a hollow cedar, and found them blackened by the fumes of  their war magic, yet wiser than the common people, they spared them and  received them into their next of kin of the Black Corn....    But the tremblings and warnings still sounded, and the people searched  for the stable Middle.    Now they called a great council of men and the beasts, birds, and  insects of all kinds. After a long council it was said,    \"Where is Water-skate? He has six legs, all very long. Perhaps he can  feel with them to the uttermost of the six regions, and point out the  very Middle.\"    So Water-skate was summoned. But lo! It was the Sun-father in his  likeness which appeared. And he lifted himself to the zenith and  extended his fingerfeet to all the six regions, so that they touched the  north, the great waters; the west, and the south, and the east, the  great waters; and to the northeast the waters above, and to the  southwest the waters below.
