The large painted  windows have been repaired by skilful artists, Mr. Ritter and Mr.  Mueller. Where the second tier begins, at the bottom of the  rose-window, are four equestrian statues, placed in niches in the  counterforts, three of which, those of Clovis, Dagobert and  Rodolphe of Habsburg, were erected in 1291, the fourth, that of  Louis XIV, was placed only in 1828. Clovis and Dagobert were the  benefactors of the church of Strasburg. Rodolphe stands there,  less on account of his liberalities to the Cathedral, than for  having been to the last the valiant friend of the Republic of  Strasburg. King Louis XIV accompanies the three others, rather  from adulation than any other cause. On the upper tier of the  facade are placed the equestrian statues of king Pepin the Short,  of Charlemain, Otho the Great and Henry I the Fowler. On the  south-side are seen in the first tier the emperors Otho II, Otho  III and Henry II; in the upper tier of the same side, the  equestrian statues of Conrad II, Henry III and the statue of  Henry IV. On the north-side of the facade are the equestrian  statues of Charles Martel, the Franconian majordomo; of Louis the  Debonair and Lotharius, the son of Louis the Debonair; at last  in the upper tier, the statues of Charles the Bald, king of the  West-Franconians and the equestrian statues of Lotharius II and  Louis the German ({+}876).    Over the rose-window, but still in the compartment of the second  tier, is a gallery furnished with the figures of the Apostles,  and above them is placed Jesus-Christ holding in his hands a  cross and banner. In the lateral towers, the same tier is taken  up on each side by a high broad window in the shape of an ogee,  before which rise very slender pillars. Exactly over these  windows, on the third tier and also on each side, are three very  high and narrow windows; the middle part, though wider, has but  two, rather small ones, and surrounded by some statues. This very  massive portion of the building betrays at first sight its later  origin; when Erwin's plan was abandoned, this part was added to  fill up the empty space between the two towers; these were  already completed, and even have on the third tier their windows  looking into the central porch, but which are at present hidden  from the outside. That part of the middle porch is used as a  belfry, four large bells are suspended in it, the largest of  which, cast in 1427, weighs nine thousand kilogrammes, and serves  to announce great festival days; it is also rung at the death of  renowned personages, or in case of fire.    It was only in the year 1849 that the front was ornamented with  statues representing the day of judgment. This group, consisting  of fifteen gigantic figures, was made after the old drawings  preserved in the archives of the _[OE]uvre-Notre-Dame_.  Jesus-Christ, as judge, is in the middle, with Mary and John the  Baptist on either side; they are surrounded by angels sounding  the trumpet of dooms-day, or bearing the instruments of our  Saviour's passion; beneath are seen the Evangelists, having men's  bodies surmounted by the heads of the four symbols which  generally accompany them.    Above the middle porch and the southward tower, is the platform,  very spacious and surrounded by a handsome balustrade; on it is  built a small house for the guardians charged to strike the hours  and ring the alarm bell in case of fire. From the top of this  platform one enjoys a magnificent view; the wonderful panorama  that unfolds itself from there, has been drawn with as much taste  as accuracy by Mr. Frederic Piton, a zealous _amateur_ of our  local history. Towards the North, in the direction of the Wacken,  an island near Strasburg, is seen on the horizon the mountain of  the _Pigeonnier_ (_Scherhol_ in German), at the foot of which  lies Wissemburg; to its right rise the peaks crowned by the ruins  of _Gutenberg_ and _Trifels_, and the famous _Geisberg_ taken by  storm in the war of 1870. On the other side of the Rhine, whose  majestic stream the eye can easily trace, the long range of the  mountains of the _Black Forest_ limits the horizon. The first  peak that is seen is that of the _Eichelberg_, at the opening of  the valley of the _Murg_; then comes the _Fremersberg_, the  _Mount-Mercury_, the mountain with the ruins of _Yburg_; all  these names are known to those who have visited Baden. Beyond  these summits is the high level ground of the _Hornisgruende_, on  the other side of which is seen, in the midst of a forest, the  dark lake named _Mummelsee_. Farther on, eastward, beyond the  arsenal of Strasburg and the village of Kehl, you observe the  castle of _Schauenburg_, near Oberkirch, where the valley of the  _Rench_ begins. After gliding over the ruin of _Fuersteneck_ and  _Schauenburg_, the eye rests on the stately buildings of  _Ortenberg_, rebuilt after the middle age architecture, at the  entrance of the valley of the _Kinzig_. Directing your eye more  towards the South, you discover the mountains of _Triberg_, and  close to them those of _Lahr_; then comes the loftiest peak of  the _Black Forest_, the _Feldberg_, 1494 metres high. Farther on  the eye may discover (if tine) the _Ballon_ and the _Blauen_,  behind the hills of the _Kaiserstuhl_; thence this ridge of  mountains is lost sight of. In the plain, between the Rhine and  the Vosges, a double row of poplars points out the _Canal_ (from  the Rhone to the Rhine). The first peak seen in the range of the  Vosges towards the South-East is the _Ballon of Sultz_, 993  metres high; the eye then discovers in a western direction the  ruins of the three castles of _Egisheim_, _Haut-Hattstatt_ and  _Landsberg_, the top of the _Ballon_ of _Gebwiller_, 1426  metres high the _Hoheneck_, the ruins of the old castles of  _Kientzheim_, _Rappoltstein, Hoh-_ (High) _K[oe]nigsburg_,  _Ortenburg_, _Bernstein_, _Frankenburg_ and the summits of the  _Bressoir_ and _Ungersberg_. Looking in the direction of  Saint-Thomas' church, at one glance the eye overlooks the country  of the old _Hohenburg_, so picturesque and so rich in monuments  and historical associations: the castle of _Landsberg_, the rock  of the _Maennelstein_, the convent of _Sainte-Odile_, behind which  rises the level ground of the _Champ-du-Feu_; further on to the  right, are the ruins of _Girbaden_, the peaks of the _Donon_ and  _Schneeberg_. Here the mountains are by degrees lost from sight  in the distance; on the horizon one may however distinguish the  towers of the castles of _Geroldseck_ and _Hoh-_ (High) _Barr_,  in the vicinity of Zabern; then nothing more is seen but meadows,  forests, fields, from the centre of which you see now and then  the modest church-steeples of the numerous villages that cover  the fine plain of Alsacia.    On the North side stands a tower of an octangular form,  supporting the spire. This tower consists, as it were, but of  strong buttresses adorned with small columns and statues, and  having large apertures in which very high windows are set and  take nearly the whole breadth on the four sides, where they are.  Among the statues that face the platform, one must be noticed as  being, according to tradition, that of Erwin of Steinbach. In  the interior of this tower are the bells that strike the hours,  that which is called the gates' bell (_Thorglocke_)[1] and also a  clock made in 1786 by two clockmakers of Strasburg, Maybaum  father and son. An inscription over the door leading to the  platform recalls to mind the earthquake of 1728, so violent that  the water was raised from the reservoirs and thrown to a distance  of eighteen feet[2]. In front of the four principal sides of the  octagon tower are turrets with winding stairs, and consisting but  of a series of windows that rise in a spiral form. These elegant  turrets seem hardly to rest on any thing; besides the gallery  that covers them, they communicate with the principal tower but  by means of flat stones that serve as an entrance into a gallery  of the interior of the arch-roof, and which lie at a height of  almost thirty metres. According to the old drawings, these  turrets should have been surmounted by pyramidal spires. They  terminate in a gallery that surrounds the tower, from whence one  enjoys a most admirable view. It is from that spot that rises  the spire (_fleche_), which is an octangular pyramid of an  extraordinary boldness, offering to the astonished gazer nothing  of a massive construction. Six successive tiers of little turrets  are thus pyramidically placed one above the other[3]. Eight  winding stair-cases, narrow and of rich open carvings, lead the  visitor to a massive spot commonly called _the lantern_; higher  up is _the crown_[4], which is not reached without danger, by  means of steps placed outside, and with no other protection than  the wall to which they are fastened; above another widened place,  called _the rose_, the spire is nothing but a column whence jut  out horizontal branches to give it the aspect of a cross. The  monument terminates in a _knob_ being 0m .460 in diameter and to  which ever since 1835 a lightning-conductor has been adapted; one  may climb there but with the aid of iron bars to which you must  cling with hands and feet. The total height of this stately  building is 142m.      [1] So called because it was rung morning and night before the    opening and closing of the city gates.      [2] In the interior of this tower and on the balustrade are seen    a great many names of foreigners who have visited the Cathedral.    Among these names are some of celebrated persons, as G[oe]the,    Herder, etc.      [3] Above the first tier of the turrets is seen around the spire    (fleche) the following inscription:          _Christus nos revocat. Christus gratis donat.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22994"],[0,"The Frontier in American History (#4)"],[1,"to Pennsylvania to fatten for the Philadelphia  market.[16:2] The ranges of the Great Plains, with ranch and cowboy and  nomadic life, are things of yesterday and of to-day. The experience of  the Carolina cowpens guided the ranchers of Texas. One element favoring  the rapid extension of the rancher's frontier is the fact that in a  remote country lacking transportation facilities the product must be in  small bulk, or must be able to transport itself, and the cattle raiser  could easily drive his product to market. The effect of these great  ranches on the subsequent agrarian history of the localities in which  they existed should be studied.    The maps of the census reports show an uneven advance of the farmer's  frontier, with tongues of settlement pushed forward and with  indentations of wilderness. In part this is due to Indian resistance, in  part to the location of river valleys and passes, in part to the unequal  force of the centers of frontier attraction. Among the important centers  of attraction may be mentioned the following: fertile and favorably  situated soils, salt springs, mines, and army posts.    The frontier army post, serving to protect the settlers from the  Indians, has also acted as a wedge to open the Indian country, and has  been a nucleus for settlement.[16:3] In this connection mention should  also be made of the government military and exploring expeditions in  determining the lines of settlement. But all the more important  expeditions were greatly indebted to the earliest pathmakers, the Indian  guides, the traders and trappers, and the French voyageurs, who were  inevitable parts of governmental expeditions from the days of Lewis and  Clark.[17:1] Each expedition was an epitome of the previous factors in  western advance.    In an interesting monograph, Victor Hehn[17:2] has traced the effect of  salt upon early European development, and has pointed out how it  affected the lines of settlement and the form of administration. A  similar study might be made for the salt springs of the United States.  The early settlers were tied to the coast by the need of salt, without  which they could not preserve their meats or live in comfort. Writing in  1752, Bishop Spangenburg says of a colony for which he was seeking lands  in North Carolina, \"They will require salt & other necessaries which  they can neither manufacture nor raise. Either they must go to  Charleston, which is 300 miles distant . . . Or else they must go to  Boling's Point in V{a} on a branch of the James & is also 300 miles from  here. . . Or else they must go down the Roanoke--I know not how many  miles--where salt is brought up from the Cape Fear.\"[17:3] This may  serve as a typical illustration. An annual pilgrimage to the coast for  salt thus became essential. Taking flocks or furs and ginseng root, the  early settlers sent their pack trains after seeding time each year to  the coast.[17:4] This proved to be an important educational influence,  since it was almost the only way in which the pioneer learned what was  going on in the East. But when discovery was made of the salt springs of  the Kanawha, and the Holston, and Kentucky, and central New York, the  West began to be freed from dependence on the coast. It was in part the  effect of finding these salt springs that enabled settlement to cross  the mountains.    From the time the mountains rose between the pioneer and the seaboard, a  new order of Americanism arose. The West and the East began to get out  of touch of each other. The settlements from the sea to the mountains  kept connection with the rear and had a certain solidarity. But the  over-mountain men grew more and more independent. The East took a narrow  view of American advance, and nearly lost these men. Kentucky and  Tennessee history bears abundant witness to the truth of this statement.  The East began to try to hedge and limit westward expansion. Though  Webster could declare that there were no Alleghanies in his politics,  yet in politics in general they were a very solid factor.    The exploitation of the beasts took hunter and trader to the west, the  exploitation of the grasses took the rancher west, and the exploitation  of the virgin soil of the river valleys and prairies attracted the  farmer. Good soils have been the most continuous attraction to the  farmer's frontier. The land hunger of the Virginians drew them down the  rivers into Carolina, in early colonial days; the search for soils took  the Massachusetts men to Pennsylvania and to New York. As the eastern  lands were taken up migration flowed across them to the west. Daniel  Boone, the great backwoodsman, who combined the occupations of hunter,  trader, cattle-raiser, farmer, and surveyor--learning, probably from the  traders, of the fertility of the lands of the upper Yadkin, where the  traders were wont to rest as they took their way to the Indians, left  his Pennsylvania home with his father, and passed down the Great Valley  road to that stream. Learning from a trader of the game and rich  pastures of Kentucky, he pioneered the way for the farmers to that  region. Thence he passed to the frontier of Missouri, where his  settlement was long a landmark on the frontier. Here again he helped to  open the way for civilization, finding salt licks, and trails, and land.  His son was among the earliest trappers in the passes of the Rocky  Mountains, and his party are said to have been the first to camp on the  present site of Denver. His grandson, Col. A. J. Boone, of Colorado, was  a power among the Indians of the Rocky Mountains, and was appointed an  agent by the government. Kit Carson's mother was a Boone.[19:1] Thus  this family epitomizes the backwoodsman's advance across the continent.    The farmer's advance came in a distinct series of waves. In Peck's New  Guide to the West, published in Boston in 1837, occurs this suggestive  passage:         Generally, in all the western settlements, three classes, like       the waves of the ocean, have rolled one after the other. First       comes the pioneer, who depends for the subsistence of his       family chiefly upon the natural growth of vegetation, called       the \"range,\" and the proceeds of hunting. His implements of       agriculture are rude, chiefly of his own make, and his efforts       directed mainly to a crop of corn and a \"truck patch.\" The       last is a rude garden for growing cabbage, beans, corn for       roasting ears, cucumbers, and potatoes. A log cabin, and,       occasionally, a stable and corn-crib, and a field of a dozen       acres, the timber girdled or \"deadened,\" and fenced, are       enough for his occupancy. It is quite immaterial whether he       ever becomes the owner of the soil. He is the occupant for       the time being, pays no rent, and feels as independent as the       \"lord of the manor.\" With a horse, cow, and one or two       breeders of swine, he strikes into the woods with his family,       and becomes the founder of a new county, or perhaps state. He       builds his cabin, gathers around him a few other families of       similar tastes and habits, and occupies till the range is       somewhat subdued, and hunting a little precarious, or, which       is more frequently the case, till the neighbors crowd around,       roads, bridges, and fields annoy him, and he lacks elbow room.       The preemption law enables him to dispose of his cabin and       cornfield to the next class of emigrants; and, to employ his       own figures, he \"breaks for the high timber,\" \"clears out for       the New Purchase,\" or migrates to Arkansas or Texas, to work       the same process over.         The next class of emigrants purchase the lands, add field to       field, clear out the roads, throw rough bridges over the       streams, put up hewn log houses with glass windows and brick       or stone chimneys, occasionally plant orchards, build mills,       school-houses, court-houses, etc., and exhibit the picture and       forms of plain, frugal, civilized life.         Another wave rolls on. The men of capital and enterprise come.       The settler is ready to sell out and take the advantage of the       rise in property, push farther into the interior and become,       himself, a man of capital and enterprise in turn. The small       village rises to a spacious town or city; substantial edifices       of brick, extensive fields, orchards, gardens, colleges, and       churches are seen. Broadcloths, silks, leghorns, crapes, and       all the refinements, luxuries, elegancies, frivolities, and       fashions are in vogue. Thus wave after wave is rolling       westward; the real Eldorado is still farther on.         A portion of the two first classes remain stationary amidst       the general movement, improve their habits and condition, and       rise in the scale of society.         The writer has traveled much amongst the first class, the real       pioneers. He has lived many years in connection with the       second grade; and now the third wave is sweeping over large       districts of Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Migration has       become almost a habit in the West. Hundreds of men can be       found, not over 50 years of age, who have settled for the       fourth, fifth, or sixth time on a new spot. To sell out and       remove only a few hundred miles makes up a portion of the       variety of backwoods life and manners.[21:1]    Omitting those of the pioneer farmers who move from the love of  adventure, the advance of the more steady farmer is easy to understand.  Obviously the immigrant was attracted by the cheap lands of the  frontier, and even the native farmer felt their influence strongly. Year  by year the farmers who lived on soil whose returns were diminished by  unrotated crops were offered the virgin soil of the frontier at nominal  prices. Their growing families demanded more lands, and these were dear.  The competition of"]]]
