Economic conditions were somewhat better in 1897, and to the  Committee's joy, Cabinet showed signs of approving the construction and  plans were eventually sent to the Library Committee for approval.    The Government had selected Mr Thomas Turnbull as architect and he was  instructed to draw up plans not only for a Library but also for  committee rooms and an imposing entrance to the buildings generally. On  the last day of the session they were approved, but as the vote was for  only L7,000 the Library Committee drew a line across the plan and said  the committee rooms were not to be built.    Demolition of the old building was undertaken in February 1898 before  tenders closed. When they were opened, they were found to be so much in  excess of the estimate that all were rejected and it was decided to  carry out the work under the cooperative system. The lowest tender for  ordinary construction was L42,000 and for fireproof L45,300; the others  were considerably higher.    On 13 April 1898 the foundation stone was laid by the Premier, Mr  Seddon, and when the session began the walls were almost complete.  Because of the noise it was decided that the work would have to cease.  All may have been quiet there, but it was very much otherwise in the  House. On the second day the Leader of the Opposition gave notice of a  motion that the House regretted that His Excellency's advisers without  the necessary authority had greatly exceeded the specific appropriation  of L7,000, such action being a dangerous subversion of the House's  control over public expenditure. There was an acrid debate but the  Government survived.    As a result of the attack, however, the Premier decided to abandon the  idea of a three-storeyed building and to limit expenditure to L25,000.  The Library Committee initiated another debate in which members tried  to get the Government to reconsider its decision. It was unsuccessful  but during the debate some of those who had condemned the spending of  more than L7,000 advised the Government to keep to the original plans.    The architect was upset at the change and stated that the alterations  had destroyed the symmetry of the building so that it was no longer a  monument to his ability. As a result his name was removed from the  foundation stone, and today the building, which was said to be the  finest example of Victorian Gothic in the country, does not bear the  name of its designer.    The Library was completed in 1899, but took some time to dry out and it  was not until early 1901 that it was occupied. It is a fine building,  but has many defects from a library point of view. The main reading  room is probably one of the most beautiful rooms in the country, but  the high windows reduce considerably the book capacity as well as  allowing too much bright light on to the stock, and on to the readers.                              THE EARLY LIBRARIANS    Ewen McColl, the first Librarian, died in 1881. It is hard at this time  to evaluate his work, indeed the Committee was very much in control and  he was its instrument. It is probable, for example, that the fine  collection of newspapers of the time was due as much to the initiative  of the Committee as to the Librarian.    He was succeeded by Angus MacGregor, a Scot, who had been associated,  it seems, with the Dunedin Athenaeum and appears to have been a man  with somewhat wider interests than his predecessor. During his time the  Library bound its large collection of pamphlets, many of which are now  of great value, and in addition absorbed the more worthwhile books from  the Wellington Provincial Library. He also began the accessioning and  shelf marking of the books. The Library was beginning to become an  organised collection.    Mr MacGregor resigned in July 1885 and spent his later years as a  teacher. He was succeeded by Mr James Collier, another Scot and a  graduate of St. Andrews and Edinburgh. He came to New Zealand in 1882  and had previously been an assistant to Herbert Spencer and was  compiler of the first and last volumes of the _Descriptive Sociology_.    He early realised that there was little likelihood of a new library  building, but his reports show that he grasped the essential aims of a  library, and particularly a legislative library. His reports deplored  the lack of copyright deposit in New Zealand, while he did much to make  the resources of the Library available to students.    One of his main tasks was to build up the collection relating to New  Zealand in the Library. This has always been essential material and in  his day the Library began to fill the gaps, a task which is not yet  completed. Collier's interest was great and he compiled the first New  Zealand bibliography, published by the Government Printer in 1889.    His health was not good and after sick leave in 1889 he resigned in  1890. A few years later he went to Australia and until his death in  1925 was engaged in writing, being the author of a life of Sir George  Grey and of _The Pastoral Age in Australia_.    The Library Committee advertised the vacancy and recommended the  appointment of the Hon. J. W. Fortescue, then Governor's Secretary. The  choice did not seem popular and there was some argument in the House  whether or not it was legal to appoint an officer when the salary had  not been voted. As a result the application was withdrawn. Though this  may have been a bad thing for the Library, it was a good one for other  reasons. Today Sir John Fortescue is known as the author of the  monumental _History of the British Army_ as well as other books, and  for having been the Royal Librarian at Windsor.    The Committee then appointed Mr H. L. James, B.A., Acting Librarian. Mr  James had joined the staff in 1889 and continued as a member until  1923. He was a born librarian, hampered by devotion to detail and the  desire to do the almost impossible. Generally whatever he did was sound  and has stood the test of time. For 10 years until January 1901 he was  in charge. Though two attempts were made to appoint him Librarian, and  one (in 1891) to appoint the Serjeant-at-Arms, Colonel De Quincey,  Librarian, it was not until 1900, when the new building was almost  completed, that the necessity for further staff made some additional  appointments necessary and a Chief Librarian was appointed.    Mr James' main monument is the _Library Catalogue_. The first catalogue  had been printed in 1862 in London, and it lists a good working  collection for Parliament. Other editions appeared in 1872, 1875, 1880,  and 1884, each having one or more supplements.    However useful they were from the members' point of view, they were not  the best examples of the cataloguer's art. In 1890 the Committee  authorised a new edition and the supervision was entrusted to Mr James,  the work of compilation being done by Mr B. E. Stocker, M.A. The  manuscript was completed in May 1894, but the cost of printing was so  great that the length of the entries had to be cut again and again. The  first volume was issued in 1895 and the second in 1897.    Unfortunately the catalogue does not give the Dewey Class number for  the books. This system was adopted in April 1898 and has provided a  more systematic arrangement of the books.    The staff, which consisted of a single full-time member in 1866, had in  1886 grown to three full-time assistants with two extra assistants  during the session. By 1899 the staff was five assistants and a  mailman. The latter was employed because for many years the Library  also served as post office. Stamps were sold, and an extra assistant  was employed for fetching and posting mails. The Library Committee  frequently suggested that the day had arrived for the Library staff to  be relieved of these duties but it was not until 1923 that the post  office moved to its present location. About 1910, however, a mailman  was provided by the post office, though he still worked under the  charge of the Chief Librarian.    As the day when the Library would move to its new home drew nearer the  question of staff became more important, particularly the question of  a Chief Librarian. It was thought impracticable to have Mr James  appointed, and during the session of 1899 the matter was seriously  considered. A subcommittee recommended that a Chief Librarian (at a  salary of L400) be selected in England and that certain other additions  be made. The question of an English appointment was vigorously debated  until finally in September 1900 selection in New Zealand was  recommended. The position was advertised in the _New Zealand Gazette_  and Mr Charles Wilson, former journalist, and M.H.R. for Wellington  Suburbs for two years, was appointed. Mr Wilson, who was a member of  the Library Committee, had not sought re-election in 1899.    As Mr Wilson did not take up his new duties until February 1901, the  task of making arrangements for moving into the new building fell to Mr  James. Though the building was completed in 1899, it was at first too  damp to hold books, and later the shelving was not ready for the stock.  Mr James, however, went steadily ahead with classification while a  barrage of correspondence aimed at hastening the day for entry into the  new home was maintained.                              THE TWENTIETH CENTURY    When the Library entered its new quarters it possessed 52,000 volumes.  Ten years later it had grown to 80,000 and by 1921 to 102,000. This  growth of between two and three thousand volumes a year was reduced  somewhat in the twenties and in 1931 the stock was 123,000. Accessions  increased during the depression years and after, so that in 1941 they  totalled 159,000. Another increase occurred during the forties and an  average of 5,000 volumes was added annually, bringing the number of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#4)"],[1," of my scouts rode up with the report that a large British  force was in sight on the other side of the River Ingogo. I said to  myself at the time: \"If this be true the British have rushed up fairly  quickly, and the fat will be in the fire very soon.\"    We then broke into scattered formation and carefully proceeded into  Natal. After much reconnoitring and concealment, however, we soon  discovered that the \"large English force\" was only a herd of cattle  belonging to friendly Boers, and that the camp consisted of two tents  occupied by some Englishmen and Kaffirs who were mending a defective  bridge. We also came across a cart drawn by four bullocks belonging to  a Natal farmer, and I believe this was the first plunder we captured  in Natal. The Englishman, who said he knew nothing about any war,  received a pass to proceed with his servants to the English lines,  and he left with the admonition to in future read the newspapers and  learn when war was imminent. Next day our entire commando was well  into Natal. The continuous rain and cold of the Drakenbergen rendered  our first experience of veldt life, if not unbearable, very  discouraging. We numbered a fairly large commando, as Commandant J.  Lombard, commanding the Hollander corps, had also joined us. Close by  Newcastle we encountered a large number of commandos, and a general  council of war was held under the presidency of Commandant General  Joubert. It was here decided that Generals Lukas Meyer and Dijl  Erasmus should take Dundee, which an English garrison held, while our  commandos under General Kock were instructed to occupy the Biggarburg  Pass. Preceded by scouts we wound our way in that direction, leaving  all our unnecessary baggage in the shape of provisions and ammunition  waggons at Newcastle.    One of my acting field-cornets and the field-cornets of the German  commando, prompted by goodness knows what, pressed forward south,  actually reaching the railway station at Elandslaagte. A goods train  was just steaming into the station, and it was captured by these  foolhardy young Moltkes. I was much dissatisfied with this action, and  sent a messenger ordering them to retire after having destroyed the  railway. On the same night I received instructions from General Kock  to proceed with two hundred men and a cannon to Elandslaagte, and I  also learned that Captain Schiel and his German Corps had left in the  same direction.    Imagine, we had gone further than had actually been decided at the  council of war, and we pressed forward still further without any  attempt being made to keep in touch with the other commandos on our  left and right. Seeing the inexpediency of this move, I went to the  General in command and expressed my objections to it. But General Kock  was firmly decided on the point, and said, \"Go along, my boy.\" We  reached Elandslaagte at midnight; it was raining very heavily. After  scrambling for positions in the darkness, although I had already  sufficiently seen that the lie of the land suggested no strategic  operations, we retired to rest. Two days later occurred the fateful  battle.          CHAPTER IV.    DEFEATED AT ELANDSLAAGTE.      In the grey dawn of the 21st of October a number of scouts I had  despatched overnight in the direction of Ladysmith returned with the  tidings that \"the khakis were coming.\" \"Where are they, and how many  are there of them?\" I asked. \"Commandant,\" the chief scout replied, \"I  don't know much about these things, but I should think that the  English number quite a thousand mounted men, and they have guns, and  they have already passed Modderspruit.\" To us amateur soldiers this  report was by no means reassuring, and I confess I hoped fervently  that the English might stay away for some little time longer.    It was at sunrise that the first shot I heard in this war was fired.  Presently the men we dreaded were visible on the ridges of hills south  of the little red railway station at Elandslaagte. Some of my men  hailed the coming fight with delight; others, more experienced in the  art of war, turned deadly pale. That is how the Boers felt in their  first battle. The awkward way in which many of my men sought cover,  demonstrated at once how inexperienced in warfare we youngsters were.  We started with our guns and tried a little experimental shooting. The  second and third shots appeared to be effective; at any rate, as far  as we could judge, they seemed to disturb the equanimity of the  advancing troops. I saw an ammunition cart deprived of its team and  generally smashed.    The British guns appeared to be of very small calibre indeed.  Certainly they failed to reach us, and all the harm they did was to  send a shell through a Boer ambulance within the range of fire. This  shot was, I afterwards ascertained, purely accidental. When the  British found that we too, strange to say, had guns, and, what is  more, knew how to use them, they retired towards Ladysmith. But this  was merely a ruse; they had gone back to fetch more. Still, though it  was a ruse, we were cleverly deceived by it, and while we were  off-saddling and preparing the mid-day meal they were arranging a new  and more formidable attack. From the Modderspruit siding they were  pouring troops brought down by rail, and although we had a splendid  chance of shelling the newcomers from the high kopje we occupied,  General Kock, who was in supreme command of our corps, for some reason  which has never been explained, refused to permit us to fire upon  them. I went to General Kock and pleaded with him, but he was adamant.  This was a bitter disappointment to me, but I consoled myself with the  thought that the General was much older than myself, and had been  fighting since he was a baby. I therefore presumed he knew better.  Possibly if we younger commanders had had more authority in the  earlier stages of the war, and had had less to deal with arrogant and  stupid old men, we should have reached Durban and Cape Town.    I must here again confess that none of my men displayed any of the  martial determination with which they had so buoyantly proceeded from  Johannesburg. To put it bluntly, some of them were \"footing\" it and  the English cavalry, taking advantage of this, were rapidly  outflanking them. The British tactics were plain enough. General  French had placed his infantry in the centre with three field  batteries (fifteen pounders), while his cavalry, with Maxims,  encompassed our right and left. He was forming a crescent, with the  obvious purpose of turning our position with his right and left wing.  When charging at the close of the attack the cavalry, which consisted  mainly of lancers, were on both our flanks, and completely prevented  our retreat. It was not easy to estimate the number of our assailant's  forces. Judging roughly, I calculated they numbered between 5,000 and  6,000, while we were 800 all told, and our artillery consisted merely  of two Nordenfeldt guns with shell, and no grape shot.    The British certainly meant business that day. It was the baptismal  fire of the Imperial Light Horse, a corps principally composed of  Johannesburgers, who were politically and racially our bitter enemies.  And what was more unfortunate, our guns were so much exposed that  they were soon silenced. For a long time we did our best to keep our  opponents at bay, but they came in crushing numbers, and speedily dead  and maimed burghers covered the veldt. Then the Gordon Highlanders and  the other infantry detachments commenced to storm our positions. We  got them well within the range of our rifle fire, and made our  presence felt; but they kept pushing on with splendid determination  and indomitable pluck, though their ranks were being decimated before  our very eyes.    This was the first, as it was the last time in the War that I heard a  British band playing to cheer attacking \"Tommies.\" I believe it used  to be a British war custom to rouse martial instincts with lively  music, but something must have gone wrong with the works in this War,  there must have occurred a rift in the lute, for ever after this first  battle of Elandslaagte the British abandoned flags, banners, and bands  and other quite unnecessary furniture.    About half an hour before sunset, the enemy had come up close to our  positions and on all sides a terrible battle raged. To keep them back  was now completely out of the question. They had forced their way  between a kloof, and while rushing up with my men towards them, my  rifle was smashed by a bullet. A wounded burgher handed me his and I  joined Field-Cornet Peter Joubert who, with seven other burghers, was  defending the kloof. We poured a heavy fire into the British, but they  were not to be shaken off. Again and again they rushed up in  irresistible strength, gallantly encouraged by their brave officers.  Poor Field-Cornet Joubert perished at this point.    When the sun had set and the awful scene was enveloped in darkness  there was a dreadful spectacle of maimed Germans, Hollanders,  Frenchmen, Irishmen, Americans, and Boers lying on the veldt. The  groans of the wounded were heartrending; the dead could no longer  speak. Another charge, and the British, encouraged by their success,  had taken our last position, guns and all. My only resource now was to  flee, and the battle of Elandslaagte was a thing of the past.          CHAPTER V.    PURSUED BY THE LANCERS.      Another last look at the bloody scene. It was very hard to have to  beat an ignominious retreat, but it was harder still to have to go  without being able to attend to one's wounded comrades, who were  piteously crying aloud for help. To have to leave them in the hands of  the enemy was exceedingly distressing to me. But there was no other  course open, and fleeing, I hoped I might \"live to fight another day.\"  I got away, accompanied by Fourie and my Kaffir servant. \"Let us go,\"  I said, \"perhaps we shall be able to"]]]
