You may cut up a capon or pheasant the same way, but of your capon  cut not off the pinion, but in the place where you put the pinion of  the turkey, you must put the gizard of your capon on each side half.        _Dismember that Hern._    Take off both the legs, and lace it down to the breast with your  knife on both sides, raise up the flesh, and take it clean off with  the pinion; then stick the head in the breast, set the pinion on the  contrary side of the carcase, and the leg on the other side, so that  the bones ends may meet cross over the carcase, and the other wings  cross over upon the top of the carcase.        _Unbrace that Mallard._    Raise up the pinion and the leg, but take them not off, raise the  merry-thought from the breast, and lace it down on each side of the  breast with your knife, bending to and fro like ways.        _Unlace that Coney._    Turn the back downwards, & cut the belly flaps clean off from the  kidney, but take heed you cut not the kidney nor the flesh, then put  in the point of your knife between the kidneys, and loosen the flesh  from each side the bone then turn up the back of the rabbit, and cut  it cross between the wings, and lace it down close by the bone with  your knife on both sides, then open the flesh of the rabbit from the  bone, with the point of your knife against the kidney, and pull the  leg open softly with your hand, but pluck it not off, then thrust in  your knife betwixt the ribs and the kidney, slit it out, and lay the  legs close together.        _Sauce that Capon._    Lift up the right leg and wing, and so array forth, and lay him in  the platter as he should fly, and so serve him.

Then the veil is drawn again, the procession passes on,  and the streets are left quiet for awhile.    [Illustration: Plate 3  THE GREAT GATE OF THE TEMPLE OF LUXOR, WITH OBELISK. _Pages 74, 75_]    We are reminded that, if we wish to get a meal before starting out to  see Pharaoh passing in procession to the temple, we had better lose no  time, and so we turn our faces riverwards again, and wander down through  the endless maze of streets to where our galley is moored at the quay.          CHAPTER IV    PHARAOH AT HOME      The time is coming on now for the King to go in state to the great  temple at Karnak to offer sacrifice, and as we go up to the palace to  see him come forth in all his glory, let me tell you a little about him  and the kind of life he leads. Pharaoh, of course, is not his real name;  it is not even his official title; it is just a word which is used to  describe a person who is so great that people scarcely venture to call  him by his proper name. Just as the Turks nowadays speak of the \"Sublime  Porte,\" when they mean the Sultan and his Government, so the Egyptians  speak of \"Per-o,\" or Pharaoh, as we call it, which really signifies  \"Great House,\" when they mean the King.    For the King of Egypt is a very great man indeed; in fact, his people  look upon him, and he looks upon himself, as something more than a man.  There are many gods in Egypt; but the god whom the people know best,  and to whom they pay the most reverence, is their King. Ever since there  have been Kings in the country, and that is a very long time now, the  reigning monarch has been looked upon as a kind of god manifest in the  flesh. He calls himself \"Son of the Sun\"; in the temples you will see  pictures of his childhood, where great goddesses dandle the young god  upon their knees (Plate 2). Divine honours are paid, and sacrifices  offered to him; and when he dies, and goes to join his brother-gods in  heaven, a great temple rises to his memory, and hosts of priests are  employed in his worship. There is just one distinction made between him  and the other gods. Amen at Thebes, Ptah at Memphis, and all the rest of  the crowd of divinities, are called \"the great gods.\" Pharaoh takes a  different title. He is called \"the good god.\"    At present \"the good god\" is Ramses II. Of course, that is only one part  of his name; for, like all the other Pharaohs, he has a list of titles  that would fill a page. His subjects in Thebes have not seen very much  of him for a long time, for there has been so much to do away in Syria,  that he has built another capital at Tanis, which the Hebrews call Zoan,  down between the Delta and the eastern frontier, and spends most of his  time there. People who have been down the river tell us great wonders  about the beauty of the new town, its great temple, and the huge statue  of the King, 90 feet high, which stands before the temple gate. But  Thebes is still the centre of the nation's life, and now, when it is  growing almost certain that there will be another war with those vile  Hittites in the North of Syria, he has come up to the great city to  take counsel with his brother-god, Amen, and to make arrangements for  gathering his army. The royal palace is in a constant bustle, with  envoys coming and going, and counsellors and generals continually  passing in and out with reports and orders.    Outside, the palace is not so very imposing. The Egyptians built their  temples to last for ever; but the palaces of their Kings were meant to  serve only for a short time. The new King might not care for the old  King's home, and so each Pharaoh builds his house according to his own  taste, of light materials. It will serve his turn, and his successor may  build another for himself. A high wall, with battlements, towers, and  heavy gates, surrounds it; for, though Pharaoh is a god, his subjects  are sometimes rather difficult to keep in order. Plots against the King  have not been unknown in the past; and on at least one occasion, a great  Pharaoh of bygone days had to spring from his couch and fight  single-handed for his life against a crowd of conspirators who had  forced an entrance into the palace while he was enjoying his siesta. So  since then Pharaoh has found it better to trust in his strong walls, and  in the big broadswords of his faithful Sardinian guardsmen, than in any  divinity that may belong to himself.    Within the great boundary wall lie pleasant gardens, gay with all sorts  of flowers, and an artificial lake shows its gleaming water here and  there through the trees and shrubs. The palace itself is all glittering  white stucco on the outside. A high central door leads into a great  audience hall, glowing with colour, its roof supported by painted  pillars in the form of lotus-stalks; and on either side of this lie two  smaller halls. Behind the audience chamber are two immense  dining-rooms, and behind these come the sleeping apartments of the  numerous household. Ramses has a multitude of wives, and a whole army of  sons and daughters, and it takes no small space to house them all. The  bedroom of the great King himself stands apart from the other rooms, and  is surrounded by banks of flowers in full bloom.    The Son of the Sun has had a busy day already. He has had many letters  and despatches to read and consider. Some of the Syrian vassal-princes  have sent clay tablets, covered with their curious arrow-headed writing,  giving news of the advance of the Hittites, and imploring the help of  the Egyptian army; and now the King is about to give audience, and to  consider these with his great nobles and Generals. At one end of the  reception hall stands a low balcony, supported on gaily-painted wooden  pillars which end in capitals of lotus-flowers. The front of this  balcony is overlaid with gold, and richly decorated with turquoise and  lapis lazuli. Here the King will show himself to his subjects,  accompanied by his favourite wife, Queen Nefertari, and some of the  young Princes and Princesses. The folding doors of the audience chamber  are thrown open, and the barons, the provincial governors, and the high  officers of the army and the State throng in to do homage to their  master.    [Illustration]    In a few moments the glittering crowd is duly arranged, a door opens at  the back of the balcony, and the King of the Two Lands, Lord of the  Vulture and the Snake, steps forth with his Queen and family. In earlier  times, whenever the King appeared, the assembled nobles were expected to  fall on their faces and kiss the ground before him. Fashion has  changed, however, and now the great folks, at all events, are no longer  required to \"smell the earth.\" As Pharaoh enters the balcony, the nobles  bow profoundly, and raise their arms as if in prayer to \"the good god.\"  Then, in silent reverence, they wait until it shall please their lord to  speak.    Ramses sweeps his glance over the crowd, singles out the General in  command of the Theban troops, and puts a question to him as to the  readiness of his division--the picked division of the army. The soldier  steps forward with a deep bow; but it is not Court manners for him to  answer his lord's question directly. Instead, he begins by reciting a  little psalm of praise, which tells of the King's greatness, his valour  and skill in war, and asserts that wherever his horses tread his enemies  flee before him and perish. This little piece of flattery over, the  General begins, \"O King, my master,\" and in a few sensible words gives  the information required. So the audience goes on, counsellor after  counsellor coming forward at the royal command, reciting his little  hymn, and then giving his opinion on such matters as his master suggests  to him. At last the council is over, the King gives orders to his  equerry to prepare his chariot for the procession to the temple, and, as  he turns to leave the audience chamber, the assembled nobles once more  bow profoundly, and raise their arms in adoration.    After a short delay, the great gates of the boundary wall of the palace  are opened; a company of spearmen, in quilted leather kilts and leather  skull-caps, marches out, and takes position a short distance from the  gateway. Behind them comes a company of the Sardinians of the guard,  heavily armed, with bright helmets, broad round shields, quilted  corselets, and long, heavy, two-edged swords. They range themselves on  either side of the roadway, and stand like statues, waiting for the  appearance of Pharaoh. There is a whir of chariot-wheels, and the royal  chariot sweeps through the gateway, and sets off at a good round pace  towards the temple. The spearmen in front start at the double, and the  guardsmen, in spite of their heavy equipment, keep pace with their royal  master on either side.    The waiting crowd bows to the dust as the sovereign passes; but Pharaoh  looks neither to the right hand nor to the left. He stands erect and  impassive in the swaying chariot, holding the crook and whip which are  the Egyptian royal emblems. On his head he wears the royal war helmet,  in the front of which a golden cobra rears its crest from its coils, as  if to threaten the enemies of Egypt. His finely-shaped, swarthy features  are adorned, or disfigured, by an artificial beard, which is fastened on  by a strap passing up in front of the ears. His tall slender body is  covered, above his corselet, with a robe of fine white linen, a perfect  wonder of pleating; and round his waist passes a girdle of gold and  green enamel, whose ends cross and hang down almost to his knees,  terminating in two threatening cobra heads (Plate 4 and Cover Picture).  On either side of him run the fan-bearers, who manage, by a miracle of  skill and activity, to keep their great gaily-coloured fans of perfumed  ostrich feathers waving round the royal head even as they run.    Behind the King comes a long train of other chariots, only less"]]]
