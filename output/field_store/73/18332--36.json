I have, indeed, only given you two boughs  instead of four; because the perspective of the crossing ones could not  have been given without confusing the figure; but I imagine you have  quite enough of them as it is.    \"Nay, but,\" some of you instantly answer, \"if we had been as long  accustomed to square-leaved ash trees as we have been to sharp-leaved  ash trees, we should like them just as well.\" Do not think it. Are you  not much more accustomed to gray whinstone and brown sandstone than you  are to rubies or emeralds? and yet will you tell me you think them as  beautiful? Are you not more accustomed to the ordinary voices of men  than to the perfect accents of sweet singing? yet do you not instantly  declare the song to be loveliest? Examine well the channels of your  admiration, and you will find that they are, in verity, as unchangeable  as the channels of your heart's blood; that just as by the pressure of a  bandage, or by unwholesome and perpetual action of some part of the  body, that blood may be wasted or arrested, and in its stagnancy cease  to nourish the frame, or in its disturbed flow affect it with incurable  disease, so also admiration itself may, by the bandages of fashion,  bound close over the eyes and the arteries of the soul, be arrested in  its natural pulse and healthy flow; but that wherever the artificial  pressure is removed, it will return into that bed which has been traced  for it by the finger of God.    10. Consider this subject well, and you will find that custom has indeed  no real influence upon our feelings of the beautiful, except in dulling  and checking them; that is to say, it will and does, as we advance in  years, deaden in some degree our enjoyment of all beauty, but it in no  wise influences our determination of what is beautiful, and what is not.  You see the broad blue sky every day over your heads; but you do not for  that reason determine blue to be less or more beautiful than you did at  first; you are unaccustomed to see stones as blue as the sapphire, but  you do not for that reason think the sapphire less beautiful than other  stones. The blue color is everlastingly appointed by the Deity to be a  source of delight; and whether seen perpetually over your head, or  crystallized once in a thousand years into a single and incomparable  stone, your acknowledgment of its beauty is equally natural, simple, and  instantaneous. Pardon me for engaging you in a metaphysical discussion;  for it is necessary to the establishment of some of the greatest of all  architectural principles that I should fully convince you of this great  truth, and that I should quite do away with the various objections to  it, which I suppose must arise in your minds. Of these there is one more  which I must briefly meet. You know how much confusion has been  introduced into the subject of criticism, by reference to the power of  Association over the human heart; you know how often it has been said  that custom must have something to do with our ideas of beauty, because  it endears so many objects to the affections. But, once for all, observe  that the powers of association and of beauty are two entirely distinct  powers,--as distinct, for instance, as the forces of gravitation and  electricity. These forces may act together, or may neutralize one  another, but are not for that reason to be supposed the same force; and  the charm of association will sometimes enhance, and sometimes entirely  overpower, that of beauty; but you must not confound the two together.  You love many things because you are accustomed to them, and are pained  by many things because they are strange to you; but that does not make  the accustomed sight more beautiful, or the strange one less so. The  well-known object may be dearer to you, or you may have discovered  charms in it which others cannot; but the charm was there before you  discovered it, only needing time and love to perceive it. You love your  friends and relations more than all the world beside, and may perceive  beauties in their faces which others cannot perceive; but you feel that  you would be ridiculous in allowing yourselves to think them the most  beautiful persons in the world: you acknowledge that the real beauty of  the human countenance depends on fixed laws of form and expression, and  not on the affection you bear to it, or the degree in which you are  familiarized with it: and so does the beauty of all other existences.    11. Now, therefore, I think that, without the risk of any farther  serious objection occurring to you, I may state what I believe to be the  truth,--that beauty has been appointed by the Deity to be one of the  elements by which the human soul is continually sustained; it is  therefore to be found more or less in all natural objects, but in order  that we may not satiate ourselves with it, and weary of it, it is rarely  granted to us in its utmost degrees. When we see it in those utmost  degrees, we are attracted to it strongly, and remember it long, as in  the case of singularly beautiful scenery or a beautiful countenance. On  the other hand, absolute ugliness is admitted as rarely as perfect  beauty; but degrees of it more or less distinct are associated with  whatever has the nature of death and sin, just as beauty is associated  with what has the nature of virtue and of life.    12. This being so, you see that when the relative beauty of any  particular forms has to be examined, we may reason, from the forms of  Nature around us, in this manner:--what Nature does generally, is sure  to be more or less beautiful; what she does rarely, will either be  _very_ beautiful, or absolutely ugly. And we may again easily determine,  if we are not willing in such a case to trust our feelings, which of  these is indeed the case, by this simple rule, that if the rare  occurrence is the result of the complete fulfillment of a natural law,  it will be beautiful; if of the violation of a natural law, it will be  ugly. For instance, a sapphire is the result of the complete and perfect  fulfillment of the laws of aggregation in the earth of alumina, and it  is therefore beautiful; more beautiful than clay, or any other of the  conditions of that earth. But a square leaf on any tree would be ugly,  being a violation of the laws of growth in trees,[5] and we ought to  feel it so.    [Footnote 5: I am at present aware only of one tree, the tulip tree,  which has an exceptional form, and which, I doubt not, every one will  admit, loses much beauty in consequence. All other leaves, as far as I  know, have the round or pointed arch in the form of the extremities of  their foils.]    13. Now then, I proceed to argue in this manner from what we see in the  woods and fields around us; that as they are evidently meant for our  delight, and as we always feel them to be beautiful, we may assume that  the forms into which their leaves are cast, are indeed types of beauty,  not of extreme or perfect, but average beauty. And finding that they  invariably terminate more or less in pointed arches, and are not  square-headed, I assert the pointed arch to be one of the forms most  fitted for perpetual contemplation by the human mind; that it is one of  those which never weary, however often repeated; and that therefore,  being both the strongest in structure, and a beautiful form (while the  square head is both weak in structure, and an ugly form), we are unwise  ever to build in any other.    [Illustration: PLATE IV. (Fig. 7.)]    14. Here, however, I must anticipate another objection. It may be asked  why we are to build only the tops of the windows pointed,--why not  follow the leaves, and point them at the bottom also?    For this simple reason, that, while in architecture you are continually  called upon to do what may be _unnecessary_ for the sake of beauty, you  are never called upon to do what is _inconvenient_ for the sake of  beauty. You want the level window sill to lean upon, or to allow the  window to open on a balcony: the eye and the common sense of the  beholder require this necessity to be met before any laws of beauty are  thought of. And besides this, there is in the sill no necessity for the  pointed arch as a bearing form; on the contrary, it would give an idea  of weak support for the sides of the window, and therefore is at once  rejected. Only I beg of you particularly to observe that the level sill,  although useful, and therefore admitted, does not therefore become  beautiful; the eye does not like it so well as the top of the window,  nor does the sculptor like to attract the eye to it; his richest  moldings, traceries, and sculptures are all reserved for the top of the  window; they are sparingly granted to its horizontal base. And farther,  observe, that when neither the convenience of the sill, nor the support  of the structure, are any more of moment, as in small windows and  traceries, you instantly _have_ the point given to the bottom of the  window. Do you recollect the west window of your own Dunblane Abbey? If  you look in any common guide-book, you will find it pointed out as  peculiarly beautiful,--it is acknowledged to be beautiful by the most  careless observer. And why beautiful? Look at it (_fig._ 7). Simply  because in its great contours it has the form of a forest leaf, and  because in its decoration it has used nothing but forest leaves. The  sharp and expressive molding which surrounds it is a very interesting  example of one used to an enormous extent by the builders of the early  English Gothic, usually in the form seen in _fig._ 2, Plate II.,  composed of clusters of four sharp leaves each, originally produced by  sculpturing the sides of a four-sided pyramid, and afterwards brought  more or less into a true image of leaves, but deriving all its "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#4)"],[1,"Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and  pleasant.\"    All that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping  dry branches into it to see how they looked. He found a branch that  satisfied him, and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and told  him rudely enough that he was wanted at the Council Rock, he laughed  till Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing.    Akela the Lone Wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the  leadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his following of  scrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered. Bagheera lay  close to Mowgli, and the fire pot was between Mowgli's knees. When they  were all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a thing he would  never have dared to do when Akela was in his prime.    \"He has no right,\" whispered Bagheera. \"Say so. He is a dog's son. He  will be frightened.\"    Mowgli sprang to his feet. \"Free People,\" he cried, \"does Shere Khan  lead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?\"    \"Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak--\"  Shere Khan began.    \"By whom?\" said Mowgli. \"Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle  butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.\"    There were yells of \"Silence, thou man's cub!\" \"Let him speak. He has  kept our Law\"; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: \"Let the  Dead Wolf speak.\" When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is  called the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long.    Akela raised his old head wearily:--    \"Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I  have led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has been  trapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill. Ye know how that plot  was made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my  weakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on  the Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the  Lone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come  one by one.\"    There was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to  the death. Then Shere Khan roared: \"Bah! What have we to do with this  toothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the man-cub who has lived too  long. Free People, he was my meat from the first. Give him to me. I  am weary of this man-wolf folly. He has troubled the jungle for ten  seasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not give  you one bone. He is a man, a man's child, and from the marrow of my  bones I hate him!\"    Then more than half the Pack yelled: \"A man! A man! What has a man to do  with us? Let him go to his own place.\"    \"And turn all the people of the villages against us?\" clamored Shere  Khan. \"No, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him  between the eyes.\"    Akela lifted his head again and said, \"He has eaten our food. He has  slept with us. He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of the  Law of the Jungle.\"    \"Also, I paid for him with a bull when he was accepted. The worth of a  bull is little, but Bagheera's honor is something that he will perhaps  fight for,\" said Bagheera in his gentlest voice.    \"A bull paid ten years ago!\" the Pack snarled. \"What do we care for  bones ten years old?\"    \"Or for a pledge?\" said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his lip.  \"Well are ye called the Free People!\"    \"No man's cub can run with the people of the jungle,\" howled Shere Khan.  \"Give him to me!\"    \"He is our brother in all but blood,\" Akela went on, \"and ye would kill  him here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters of  cattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khan's teaching,  ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager's doorstep.  Therefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It is  certain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or I would offer  that in the man-cub's place. But for the sake of the Honor of  the Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader ye have  forgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub go to his own place, I  will not, when my time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye. I will  die without fighting. That will at least save the Pack three lives.  More I cannot do; but if ye will, I can save ye the shame that comes of  killing a brother against whom there is no fault--a brother spoken for  and bought into the Pack according to the Law of the Jungle.\"    \"He is a man--a man--a man!\" snarled the Pack. And most of the wolves  began to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch.    \"Now the business is in thy hands,\" said Bagheera to Mowgli. \"We can do  no more except fight.\"    Mowgli stood upright--the fire pot in his hands. Then he stretched out  his arms, and yawned in the face of the Council; but he was furious with  rage and sorrow, for, wolflike, the wolves had never told him how they  hated him. \"Listen you!\" he cried. \"There is no need for this dog's  jabber. Ye have told me so often tonight that I am a man (and indeed I  would have been a wolf with you to my life's end) that I feel your words  are true. So I do not call ye my brothers any more, but sag [dogs], as  a man should. What ye will do, and what ye will not do, is not yours  to say. That matter is with me; and that we may see the matter more  plainly, I, the man, have brought here a little of the Red Flower which  ye, dogs, fear.\"    He flung the fire pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit  a tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in  terror before the leaping flames.    Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and  crackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves.    \"Thou art the master,\" said Bagheera in an undertone. \"Save Akela from  the death. He was ever thy friend.\"    Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave  one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black  hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that  made the shadows jump and quiver.    \"Good!\" said Mowgli, staring round slowly. \"I see that ye are dogs. I go  from you to my own people--if they be my own people. The jungle is shut  to me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship. But I will be  more merciful than ye are. Because I was all but your brother in blood,  I promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as  ye have betrayed me.\" He kicked the fire with his foot, and the sparks  flew up. \"There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack. But here  is a debt to pay before I go.\" He strode forward to where Shere Khan sat  blinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him by the tuft on his chin.  Bagheera followed in case of accidents. \"Up, dog!\" Mowgli cried. \"Up,  when a man speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!\"    Shere Khan's ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes, for  the blazing branch was very near.    \"This cattle-killer said he would kill me in the Council because he had  not killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs  when we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red Flower down  thy gullet!\" He beat Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the  tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear.    \"Pah! Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember when next I come to the  Council Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khan's hide  on my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases. Ye will  not kill him, because that is not my will. Nor do I think that ye  will sit here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were  somebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!\" The fire was  burning furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli struck right  and left round the circle, and the wolves ran howling with the sparks  burning their fur. At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps  ten wolves that had taken Mowgli's part. Then something began to hurt  Mowgli inside him, as he had never been hurt in his life before, and he  caught his breath and sobbed, and the tears ran down his face.    \"What is it? What is it?\" he said. \"I do not wish to leave the jungle,  and I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?\"    \"No, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use,\" said Bagheera.  \"Now I know thou art a man, and a man's cub no longer. The jungle is  shut indeed to thee henceforward. Let them fall, Mowgli. They are only  tears.\" So Mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break; and he  had never cried in all his life before.    \"Now,\" he said, \"I will go to men. But first I must say farewell to my  mother.\" And he went to the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and  he cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.    \"Ye will not forget me?\" said Mowgli.    \"Never while we can follow a trail,\" said the cubs. \"Come to the foot of  the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we will come  into the croplands to play with thee by night.\"    \"Come soon!\" said Father Wolf. \"Oh, wise little frog, come again soon;  for we be old, thy mother and I.\"    \"Come soon,\" said Mother Wolf, \"little naked son of mine. For, listen,  child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.\"    \"I will surely come,\" said Mowgli. \"And when I come it will be to lay  out Shere Khan's hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me! Tell them  in the jungle never to forget me!\"    The dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside  alone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men.          Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack         As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled          Once, twice and again!       And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up       From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.      "]]]
