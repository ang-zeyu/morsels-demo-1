Things being so, neutrality, he declared, was  the only policy for Greece, and he ended up by meeting the Kaiser's  threat with a counter-threat, none the less pointed for being veiled  under the guise of an \"assurance not to touch his friends among my  neighbours (i.e. Bulgaria and Turkey) as long as they do not touch our  local Balkan interests.\" [8]    {11}    Germany did not immediately resign herself to this rebuff.  The  Kaiser's Government thought King Constantine's attachment to neutrality  reasonable--for the present; but at the same time urged Greece to enter  as soon as possible into a secret understanding with Bulgaria and  Turkey for eventual action against Servia, describing the latter  country as the bear's skin of which it would be a good stroke of  business for Greece to secure a share.  The German Minister at Athens,  better acquainted with Greek views and feelings, took a less naive  line.  He did not want Greece to attack her ally, but was content to  advise that she should free herself from the ties that bound her to  Servia, and in the event of Bulgarian aggression just leave her ally in  the lurch.  But, if he went less far than his chief in one direction,  he went farther in another, threatening, should Greece move on Servia's  behalf, to ask for his passport.  This threat, like all the others,  failed to move the Athens Government;[9] and, unable to gain Greece as  an ally, Germany was henceforth glad enough not to have her as an enemy.    So far all those responsible for the policy of Greece appeared to be  unanimous in the decision not to be drawn prematurely into the European  cataclysm, but to reserve her forces for the defence of the Balkan  equilibrium.  Under this apparent unanimity, however, lay divergent  tendencies.    King Constantine, a practical soldier, estimated that the European War  would be of long duration and doubtful issue: in this battle of giants  he saw no profit for pygmies, but only perils.  At the same time, he  did not forget that Greece had in Bulgaria and Turkey two embittered  enemies {12} who would most probably try to fish in the troubled  waters.  If they did so, he was prepared to fight; but to fight with a  definite objective and on a definite military plan which took into  account the elements of time, place, and resources.    The King's standpoint was shared by most Greek statesmen and soldiers  of note: they all, in varying degrees, stood for neutrality, with  possible intervention on the side of the Entente at some favourable  moment.  But it did not commend itself to his Premier.  Caution was  foreign to M. Venizelos's ambitious and adventurous temperament.  Military considerations had little meaning for his civilian mind.  Taking the speedy victory of the Entente as a foregone conclusion, and  imbued with a sort of mystical faith in his own prophetic insight and  star, he looked upon the European War as an occasion for Imperialist  aggrandizement which he felt that Greece ought to grasp without an  instant's delay.    It was not long before the underlying divergence came to the surface.    In the morning of 18 August, at a full Cabinet Meeting, M. Streit  mentioned that the Russian Minister had privately referred to the  possibility of Greece sending 150,000 men to fight with Servia against  the Austrians on the Danube--far away from the Greek Army's natural  base in Macedonia.  On hearing this M. Venizelos impulsively declared  that he was ready to place all the Greek forces at the disposal of the  Entente Powers in accordance with their invitation.  M. Streit  remonstrated that there had been no \"invitation,\" but at most a  sounding from one of the Entente Ministers, which Greece should meet  with a counter-sounding, in order to learn to what extent the  suggestion was serious.  Further, he objected that, before Greece  committed herself, it was necessary to find out where she would be  expected to fight, the conditions under which she would fight, and the  compensations which she would receive in the event of victory.  As a  last resort he proposed to adjourn the discussion until the afternoon.  But M. Venizelos answered that there was no time to lose: the War would  be over in three weeks.[10]  Whereupon {13} M. Streit resigned, and M.  Venizelos offered to the Entente Ministers the adhesion of Greece  forthwith.    The terms in which this offer was couched have never been divulged; but  from the French Minister's descriptions of it as made \"_a titre  gracieux_\" and \"_sans conditions,_\" [11] it seems to have been  unconditional and unqualified.  On the other hand, M. Venizelos at a  later period explained that he had offered to place Greece at the  disposal of the Entente Powers, if Turkey went to war with them.[12]  And it is not improbable that the primary objective in his mind was  Turkey, who still refused to relinquish her claims to the islands  conquered by the Greeks in 1912, and had just strengthened her navy  with two German units, the _Goeben_ and the _Breslau_.  However that  may be, King Constantine seconded the offer, expressing himself quite  willing to join the Entente there and then with the whole of his army,  but stipulating, on the advice of the General Staff, that the Greek  forces should not be moved to any place where they could not, if need  arose, operate against Bulgaria.    The King of England telegraphed to the King of Greece, thanking him for  the proposal, which, he said, his Government would consider.  The  French and Russian Governments expressed lively satisfaction, France,  however, adding: \"For the moment we judge that Greece must use all her  efforts to make Turkey observe her promised neutrality, and to avoid  anything that might lead the Turkish Government to abandon its  neutrality.\"  The British answer, when it came at last, was to the same  effect: England wished by all means to avoid a collision with Turkey  and advised that Greece also should avoid a collision.  She only  suggested for the present an understanding between the Staffs with a  view to eventual action.    This suggestion was apparently a concession to Mr. Winston Churchill,  who just then had formed the opinion that Turkey would join the Central  Powers, and had arranged with Lord Kitchener that two officers of the  Admiralty should meet two officers of the War Office to work out a plan  for the seizure, by means of a Greek army, of the {14} Gallipoli  Peninsula, with a view to admitting a British fleet to the Sea of  Marmara.[13] But it no way affected the British Government's policy.  The utmost that England and France were prepared to do in order to meet  the offer of Greece, and that only if she were attacked, was to prevent  the Turkish fleet from coming out of the Dardanelles; France also  holding out some hope of financial assistance, but none of war material  on an adequate scale.[14]    Such a reception of his advances was not very flattering to M.  Venizelos--it made him look foolish in the eyes of those who had  pleaded against precipitancy; and he took the earliest opportunity to  vent his ill-humour.  King Constantine, in a reply to the British  Admiralty drafted with Vice-Admiral Mark Kerr, stated that he would not  fight Turkey unless attacked by her--a statement in strict consonance  with the wishes of the Entente Powers at the time.  But M. Venizelos  objected.  After his own declarations to the Entente Ministers, and  after the exchange of telegrams with the King of England, he told his  sovereign he did not consider this reply possible.  Turkey was their  enemy, and was it wise for them to reject a chance of fighting her with  many and powerful allies, so that they might eventually have to fight  her single-handed?[15]    Thus M. Venizelos argued, in the face of express evidence that those  allies did not desire the immediate participation of Greece in a war  against Turkey--because, anxious above all things to establish close  contact with them, he wanted the offer to remain open: \"a promise that,  should at any time the Powers consider us useful in a war against  Turkey . . . we would be at their disposal.\" [16]  And he professed  himself unable to understand how a course which appeared so clear to  him could possibly be obscure to others.  But he had a theory--a theory  which served him henceforward as a stock explanation of every  difference of opinion, and in which the political was skilfully mixed  {15} with the personal factor.  According to this theory, when face to  face with M. Venizelos, the King seldom failed to be convinced; but as  soon as M. Venizelos withdrew, he changed his mind.  This happened not  once, but many times.[17]  We have here a question of psychology which  cannot be casually dismissed.  M. Venizelos's persuasive powers are  notorious, and it is highly probable that King Constantine underwent  the fascination which this man had for others.  But behind it all,  according to the Venizelist theory, lurked another element:    \"What, I think, confuses things and begets in the mind of your Majesty  and of M. Streit tendencies opposed to those supported by me, is the  wish not to displease Germany by undertaking a war against Turkey in  co-operation with Powers hostile to her.\"  Although M. Streit had laid  down his portfolio, he continued to be consulted by the King, with the  result, M. Venizelos complained, that the difference of opinions  between the ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs and himself was fast  developing into a divergence of courses between the Crown and the  Cabinet: such a state of things was obviously undesirable, and M.  Venizelos, \"in order to facilitate the restoration of full harmony  between the Crown and its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#4)"],[1,"ster, after Nature.
