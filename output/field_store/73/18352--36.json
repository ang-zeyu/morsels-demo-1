He sent over a messenger asking my father for the back  numbers of the New York _Ledger_ containing a long serial story by Mrs.  Anna Cora Mowatt. As I remember, it was a story of the French  Revolution, and the last number that I was allowed to read ended with a  description of a dance in an old ch[^a]teau, when the Marquise, who was  floating through the minuet, suddenly discovered blood on the white-kid  glove of her right hand! I was never permitted to discover where the  blood came from; I should like to find out now if I could find the  novel. I remember that my mother was terribly shocked when my father  sent the numbers of the New York _Ledger_ to the apparently dying man.  \"It's a horrible thing,\" my mother said, \"to think of any Christian  person reading the New York _Ledger_ at the point of death.\" The young  man, however, did not die; and I rather think my father attributed his  recovery to the exhilarating effect of one of his favourite stories.    There were certain other serial stories I was ordered to read; they were  stories of the Irish Brigade in France. My mother, I remember,  disapproved of them because Madame de Pompadour was frequently  mentioned, and she thought that my father regarded the lady in question  too tolerantly. These romances were, I think, written by a certain Myles  O'Reilly who was in some way connected with the army. This procedure of  reading aloud was not always agreeable, as my father frequently went to  sleep in the middle of a passage and forgot what I had already read. The  consequence was that I was obliged to begin the same old story over  again on the following evening.    It happened that my father was one of the directors of a local library,  and in it I found Bates's volume on the Amazon--I forget the exact title  of the book. I found myself in a new world; I lived in Para; I tried to  manufacture an imitation of the Urari poison with a view to  exterminating rats in the warehouse by the use of arrows; I lived and  had my being in the forests of Brazil; and I produced, at intervals, a  thrilling novel, with the glowing atmosphere of the Amazon as a  background. I preferred Mr. Bates to any novelist I had ever read. He  held possession of my imagination, until he was forced out by a Mr.  Jerningham who wrote a most entrancing book on Brittany. Saint Malo  became the only town for me; I adored Henri de la Rochejaquelein; and  the Stuarts, whom I had learned to love at the knees of Sir Walter  Scott, were displaced by the Vend['e]ans.    Noticing that I was devoted to books of travel, my father asked me to  parse Kane's \"Arctic Voyages.\" I found the volumes cold and repellent.  They gave me a rooted prejudice against the North Pole which even the  adventure of Doctor Cook has never enabled me to overcome.    About this time, my mother began to feel that I needed to read something  more gentle, which would root me more effectively in my religion. She  began, I think, with Cardinal Newman's \"Callista\" in which there was a  thrilling chapter called \"The Possession of Juba.\" It seemed to me one  of the most stirring things I had ever read. Then I was presented with  Mrs. Sadlier's \"The Blakes and the Flanagans,\" which struck me as a very  delightful satire, and with a really interesting novel of New York  called \"Rosemary,\" by Dr. J. V. Huntington; and then a terribly  blood-curdling story of the Carbonari in Italy, called \"Lionello.\" After  this I was wafted into a series of novels by Julia Kavanagh; \"Natalie,\"  and \"Bessie,\" and \"Seven Years,\" I think were the principals. My father  declined to read them; he thought they were too sentimental, but as the  author had an Irish name he was inclined to regard them with tolerance.  He thought I would be better employed in absorbing \"Tom and Jerry; or  The Adventures of Corinthian Bob,\" by Pierce Egan. My mother objected to  this, and substituted \"Lady Violet; or the Wonder of Kingswood Chace,\"  by the younger Pierce Egan, which she considered more moral.    My father was very generous at Christmas, and I bought a large volume of  Froissart for two dollars and a half at an old book stand on Fifth  Street, near Spruce. After this, I was lost to the world during the  Christmas holidays. After breakfast, I saturated myself with the  delightful battles in that precious book.    My principal duty was to look after the front pavement. In the spring  and summer, it was carefully washed twice a week and reddened with some  kind of paint, which always accompanied a box of fine white sand for the  scouring of the marble steps; but in the winter, this respectable  sidewalk had to be kept free from snow and ice.    Hitherto my battle with the elements had been rather a diversion.  Besides, I was in competition with the other small boys in the block--or  in the \"square,\" as we Philadelphians called it. Now it became irksome;  I neglected to dig the ice from between the bricks; I skimped my  cleaning of the gutter; I forgot to put on my \"gums.\" The boy next door  became a mirror of virtue; he was quoted to me as one whose pavement was  a model to all the neighbours; indeed, it was rumoured that the Mayor  passing down our street, had stopped and admired the working of his  civic spirit, while the result of my efforts was passed by with evident  contempt. I did not care. I hugged Froissart to my heart. Who would  condescend to wield a broom and a wooden shovel, even for the reward of  ten cents in cash, when he could throw javelins and break lances with  the knights of the divine Froissart? The end of my freedom came after  this. The terrible incident of the Mayor's contempt, invented, I  believe, by the boy next door, induced my mother to believe that I was  not only losing my morals, but becoming too much of a book-worm. For  many long weeks I was deprived of any amusing book except \"Robinson  Crusoe.\" After this interval, vacation came; I seemed to have grown  older, and books were never quite the same again.    In the vacation, however, when the days were very long and there was a  great deal of leisure, I found myself reduced to Grimms' \"Fairy Tales\"  and a delightful volume by Madame Perrault, and I was even then very  much struck by the difference. Of course I read Grimm from cover to  cover, and went back again over the pages, hoping that I had neglected  something. The homeliness of the stories touched me; it seemed to me  that you found yourself in the atmosphere of old Germany. Madame  Perrault was more delicate; her fairy tales were pictures of no life  that ever existed, and there was a great dissimilarity between her  \"Cendrillon\" and the Grimms' story of \"Aschenputtel.\" As I remember, the  haughty sisters in the story of the beautiful girl who lived among the  ashes each cut off one of her toes, in order to make her feet seem  smaller and left bloody marks on the glass slipper. Madame Perrault's  slipper was, I think, of white fur, and there was no such brutality in  _her_ fairyland. But, except Hans Christian Andersen's, there are no  such gripping fairy tales as those of the Brethren Grimm. During this  vacation, too, I discovered the \"Leprachaun,\" the little Irish fairy  with the hammer. He was not at all like the English fairies in  Shakespeare's \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\" and, leaving out Ariel, I  think I liked him best of all.    That summer, too, I found an old copy of \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" in  the attic. The print was exceedingly fine, but everything was there. No  doubt there is much to be said by the pedagogues in favour of  scrupulously studying Shakespeare's plays; but if you have never  discovered \"As You Like It\" or \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" when you were  very young, you will never know the meaning of that light which never  was on land or sea, and with which Keats surrounds us in the \"Ode to the  Nightingale.\" The love interest did not count much. In my youthful  experience everybody either married or died, in books. That was to be  expected. It was the atmosphere that counted. One could see the troopers  coming into the open space in the Forest of Arden and hear their songs,  making the leaves of the trees quiver before they appeared. And Puck!  and Caliban! When I was young I was always very sorry for Caliban, and,  being very religious, I felt that the potent Prospero might have done  something for his soul.    There was a boy who lived near us called Lawrence Stockdale--peace be  to his ashes where-ever he rests! His father and mother, who were  persons of cultivation, encouraged him to read, but we were not of one  opinion on any subject. He was devoted to Dumas, the Elder. After the  episode of \"Monte Cristo\" I was led to believe that Dumas was \"wrong.\" I  preferred Sir Walter Scott, and loved all the Stuarts, having a positive  devotion for Mary, Queen of Scots. One day, however, I discovered  somewhere, under a pile of old geometries and books about navigation, a  fat, red-bound copy of \"Boccaccio.\" Stockdale said that \"Boccaccio\" was  \"wronger\" than Dumas, and that his people had warned him against the  stories of this Italian. As we lived near an Italian colony, and he  disliked Italians, while I loved them, I attributed this to mere  prejudice.    The \"Boccaccio\" was, as I have said, fat and large. For a boy who likes  to read, a fat book is very tempting, and just as I had seated myself  one afternoon on the front doorstep, to read the story of the Falcon,  and having finished it with great pleasure, dipped into another tale not  so edifying, my mother appeared. She turned pale with horror, and seized  the book at once. My father was informed of what had occurred. He was  little alarmed, I think. My mother said: \"We shall have to change the  whole course of this boy's reading.\" \"We shall have to change the boy  first,\" my father said, with a sigh. But this was not the end. At the  proper time I was led to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#4)"],[1,"  so did every bell in the house.    This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an  hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded  by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a  heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then  remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as  dragging chains.    The cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the  noise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then  coming straight towards his door.    'It's humbug still!' said Scrooge. 'I won't believe it.'    His colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through  the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming  in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's  Ghost!' and fell again.    The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,  tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his  pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he  drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like  a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,  keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His  body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking  through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.    Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had  never believed it until now.    No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through  and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling  influence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the  folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not  observed before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his  senses.    'How now!' said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. 'What do you want  with me?'    'Much!'--Marley's voice; no doubt about it.    'Who are you?'    'Ask me who I _was_.'    'Who _were_ you, then?' said Scrooge, raising his voice. 'You're  particular, for a shade.' He was going to say '_to_ a shade,' but  substituted this, as more appropriate.    'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.'    'Can you--can you sit down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.    'I can.'    'Do it, then.'    Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so  transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt  that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the  necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the  opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.    'You don't believe in me,' observed the Ghost.    'I don't,' said Scrooge.    'What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own  senses?'    'I don't know,' said Scrooge.    'Why do you doubt your senses?'    'Because,' said Scrooge, 'a little thing affects them. A slight disorder  of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,  a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.  There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!'    Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in  his heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be  smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his  terror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.    To sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,  would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something  very awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal  atmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was  clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its  hair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour  from an oven.    'You see this toothpick?' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,  for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a  second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.    'I do,' replied the Ghost.    'You are not looking at it,' said Scrooge.    'But I see it,' said the Ghost, 'notwithstanding.'    'Well!' returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and be for the  rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own  creation. Humbug, I tell you: humbug!'    At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such  a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,  to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his  horror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it  were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its  breast!    Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.    'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'    'Man of the worldly mind!' replied the Ghost, 'do you believe in me or  not?'    'I do,' said Scrooge; 'I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and  why do they come to me?'    'It is required of every man,' the Ghost returned, 'that the spirit  within him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and  wide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do  so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is  me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,  and turned to happiness!'    Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its  shadowy hands.    'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'Tell me why?'    'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost. 'I made it link  by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of  my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?'    Scrooge trembled more and more.    'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the  strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this  seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a  ponderous chain!'    Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding  himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he  could see nothing.    'Jacob!' he said imploringly. 'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak  comfort to me, Jacob!'    'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied. 'It comes from other regions,  Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of  men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all  permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.  My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my  spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;  and weary journeys lie before me!'    It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his  hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he  did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.    [Illustration: ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND]    'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,' Scrooge observed in a  business-like manner, though with humility and deference.    'Slow!' the Ghost repeated.    'Seven years dead,' mused Scrooge. 'And travelling all the time?'    'The whole time,' said the Ghost. 'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture  of remorse.'    'You travel fast?' said Scrooge.    [Illustration]    'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost.    'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,'  said Scrooge.    The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so  hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have  been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.    'Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know  that ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth  must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is  all developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in  its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too  short for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of  regret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such  was I! Oh, such was I!'    'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge,  who now began to apply this to himself.    'Business!' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. 'Mankind was my  business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,  forbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my  trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my  business!'    It held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the cause of all  its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.    'At this time of the rolling year,' the spectre said, 'I suffer most.  Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,  and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a  poor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have  conducted _me_?'    Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this  rate, and began to quake exceedingly.    'Hear me!' cried the Ghost. 'My time is nearly gone.'    'I will,' said Scrooge. 'But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery,  Jacob! Pray!'    'How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may  not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.'    It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the  perspiration from his brow.    'That is no light part of my penance,' pursued the Ghost. 'I am here  to-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my  fate. A chance and hope of my procuring,"]]]
