If you've got the nerve, read on.\"    Psmith had picked up one of the papers when there came a shuffling  of feet in the passage outside, followed by a knock upon the door.  The next moment there appeared in the doorway a short, stout young  man. There was an indescribable air of toughness about him, partly  due to the fact that he wore his hair in a well-oiled fringe almost  down to his eyebrows, which gave him the appearance of having no  forehead at all. His eyes were small and set close together. His  mouth was wide, his jaw prominent. Not, in short, the sort of man  you would have picked out on sight as a model citizen.    His entrance was marked by a curious sibilant sound, which, on  acquaintance, proved to be a whistled tune. During the interview  which followed, except when he was speaking, the visitor whistled  softly and unceasingly.    \"Mr. Windsor?\" he said to the company at large.    Psmith waved a hand towards the rocking-chair. \"That,\" he said, \"is  Comrade Windsor. To your right is Comrade Jackson, England's  favourite son. I am Psmith.\"    The visitor blinked furtively, and whistled another tune. As he  looked round the room, his eye fell on the cat. His face lit up.    \"Say!\" he said, stepping forward, and touching the cat's collar,  \"mine, mister.\"    \"Are you Bat Jarvis?\" asked Windsor with interest.    \"Sure,\" said the visitor, not without a touch of complacency, as of  a monarch abandoning his incognito.    For Mr. Jarvis was a celebrity.    By profession he was a dealer in animals, birds, and snakes. He had  a fancier's shop in Groome street, in the heart of the Bowery. This  was on the ground-floor. His living abode was in the upper story of  that house, and it was there that he kept the twenty-three cats  whose necks were adorned with leather collars, and whose numbers  had so recently been reduced to twenty-two. But it was not the fact  that he possessed twenty-three cats with leather collars that made  Mr. Jarvis a celebrity.    A man may win a purely local reputation, if only for eccentricity,  by such means. But Mr. Jarvis's reputation was far from being  purely local. Broadway knew him, and the Tenderloin. Tammany Hall  knew him. Long Island City knew him. In the underworld of New York  his name was a by-word. For Bat Jarvis was the leader of the famous  Groome Street Gang, the most noted of all New York's collections of  Apaches. More, he was the founder and originator of it. And,  curiously enough, it had come into being from motives of sheer  benevolence. In Groome Street in those days there had been a  dance-hall, named the Shamrock and presided over by one Maginnis,  an Irishman and a friend of Bat's. At the Shamrock nightly dances  were given and well attended by the youth of the neighbourhood at  ten cents a head. All might have been well, had it not been for  certain other youths of the neighbourhood who did not dance and so  had to seek other means of getting rid of their surplus energy. It  was the practice of these light-hearted sportsmen to pay their ten  cents for admittance, and once in, to make hay. And this habit, Mr.  Maginnis found, was having a marked effect on his earnings. For  genuine lovers of the dance fought shy of a place where at any  moment Philistines might burst in and break heads and furniture. In  this crisis the proprietor thought of his friend Bat Jarvis. Bat at  that time had a solid reputation as a man of his hands. It is true  that, as his detractors pointed out, he had killed no one--a defect  which he had subsequently corrected; but his admirers based his  claim to respect on his many meritorious performances with fists  and with the black-jack. And Mr. Maginnis for one held him in the  very highest esteem. To Bat accordingly he went, and laid his  painful case before him. He offered him a handsome salary to be on  hand at the nightly dances and check undue revelry by his own  robust methods. Bat had accepted the offer. He had gone to Shamrock  Hall; and with him, faithful adherents, had gone such stalwarts as  Long Otto, Red Logan, Tommy Jefferson, and Pete Brodie. Shamrock  Hall became a place of joy and order; and--more important  still--the nucleus of the Groome Street Gang had been formed. The  work progressed. Off-shoots of the main gang sprang up here and  there about the East Side. Small thieves, pickpockets and the  like, flocked to Mr. Jarvis as their tribal leader and protector  and he protected them. For he, with his followers, were of use to  the politicians. The New York gangs, and especially the Groome  Street Gang, have brought to a fine art the gentle practice of  \"repeating\"; which, broadly speaking, is the art of voting a number  of different times at different polling-stations on election days.  A man who can vote, say, ten times in a single day for you, and who  controls a great number of followers who are also prepared, if they  like you, to vote ten times in a single day for you, is worth  cultivating. So the politicians passed the word to the police, and  the police left the Groome Street Gang unmolested and they waxed  fat and flourished.    Such was Bat Jarvis.                 *    *    *    \"Pipe de collar,\" said Mr. Jarvis, touching the cat's neck. \"Mine,  mister.\"    \"Pugsy said it must be,\" said Billy Windsor. \"We found two fellows  setting a dog on to it, so we took it in for safety.\"    Mr. Jarvis nodded approval.    \"There's a basket here, if you want it,\" said Billy.    \"Nope. Here, kit.\"    Mr. Jarvis stooped, and, still whistling softly, lifted the cat. He  looked round the company, met Psmith's eye-glass, was transfixed by  it for a moment, and finally turned again to Billy Windsor.    \"Say!\" he said, and paused. \"Obliged,\" he added.    He shifted the cat on to his left arm, and extended his right hand  to Billy.    \"Shake!\" he said.    Billy did so.    Mr. Jarvis continued to stand and whistle for a few moments more.    \"Say!\" he said at length, fixing his roving gaze once more upon  Billy. \"Obliged. Fond of de kit, I am.\"    Psmith nodded approvingly.    \"And rightly,\" he said. \"Rightly, Comrade Jarvis. She is not  unworthy of your affection. A most companionable animal, full of  the highest spirits. Her knockabout act in the restaurant would  have satisfied the most jaded critic. No diner-out can afford to be  without such a cat. Such a cat spells death to boredom.\"    Mr. Jarvis eyed him fixedly, as if pondering over his remarks. Then  he turned to Billy again.    \"Say!\" he said. \"Any time you're in bad. Glad to be of service.  You know the address. Groome Street. Bat Jarvis. Good night.  Obliged.\"    He paused and whistled a few more bars, then nodded to Psmith and  Mike, and left the room. They heard him shuffling downstairs.    \"A blithe spirit,\" said Psmith. \"Not garrulous, perhaps, but what of  that? I am a man of few words myself. Comrade Jarvis's massive  silences appeal to me. He seems to have taken a fancy to you,  Comrade Windsor.\"    Billy Windsor laughed.    \"I don't know that he's just the sort of side-partner I'd go out of  my way to choose, from what I've heard about him. Still, if one got  mixed up with any of that East-Side crowd, he would be a mighty  useful friend to have. I guess there's no harm done by getting him  grateful.\"    \"Assuredly not,\" said Psmith. \"We should not despise the humblest.  And now, Comrade Windsor,\" he said, taking up the paper again, \"let  me concentrate myself tensely on this very entertaining little  journal of yours. Comrade Jackson, here is one for you. For sound,  clear-headed criticism,\" he added to Billy, \"Comrade Jackson's name  is a by-word in our English literary salons. His opinion will be  both of interest and of profit to you, Comrade Windsor.\"        CHAPTER V    PLANNING IMPROVEMENTS    \"By the way,\" said Psmith, \"what is your exact position on this  paper? Practically, we know well, you are its back-bone, its  life-blood; but what is your technical position? When your  proprietor is congratulating himself on having secured the ideal  man for your job, what precise job does he congratulate himself on  having secured the ideal man for?\"    \"I'm sub-editor.\"    \"Merely sub? You deserve a more responsible post than that, Comrade  Windsor. Where is your proprietor? I must buttonhole him and point  out to him what a wealth of talent he is allowing to waste itself.  You must have scope.\"    \"He's in Europe. At Carlsbad, or somewhere. He never comes near  the paper. He just sits tight and draws the profits. He lets the  editor look after things. Just at present I'm acting as editor.\"    \"Ah! then at last you have your big chance. You are free,  untrammelled.\"    \"You bet I'm not,\" said Billy Windsor. \"Guess again. There's no  room for developing free untrammelled ideas on this paper. When  you've looked at it, you'll see that each page is run by some one.  I'm simply the fellow who minds the shop.\"    Psmith clicked his tongue sympathetically. \"It is like setting a  gifted French chef to wash up dishes,\" he said. \"A man of your  undoubted powers, Comrade Windsor, should have more scope. That is  the cry, 'more scope!' I must look into this matter. When I gaze at  your broad, bulging forehead, when I see the clear light of  intelligence in your eyes, and hear the grey matter splashing  restlessly about in your cerebellum, I say to myself without  hesitation, 'Comrade Windsor must have more scope.'\" He looked at  Mike, who was turning over the leaves of his copy of _Cosy Moments_  in a sort of dull despair. \"Well, Comrade Jackson, and what is your  verdict?\"    Mike looked at Billy Windsor. He wished to be polite, yet he could  find nothing polite to say. Billy interpreted the look.    \"Go on,\" he said. \"Say it. It can't be worse than what I think.\"    \"I expect some people would like it awfully,\" said Mike.    \"They must, or they wouldn't buy it. I've never met any of them  yet, though.\"    Psmith"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26076"],[0,"Birds from Coahuila, Mexico (#4)"],[1,"not to have been recorded previously from Coahuila [Eds.].    _Botaurus lentiginosus_ (Rackett).--Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1950:34) listed the American Bittern from the \"extreme northern part\"  of Coahuila. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:14) saw two representatives of  this bittern \"along the Rio Grande not far from Hot Springs,\" Texas, on  May 15. I suspect that this is the locality to which Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (_loc. cit._) referred.

The Gadwell is not an uncommon spring migrant; Olmstead saw it 10 mi. E  Hacienda La Mariposa on March 30, 1952, and Baker observed it 8 mi. N  and 4 mi. W Muzquiz on March 30, 1952. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1950:42) recorded the Gadwell from Coahuila.    _Anas acuta_ Linnaeus.--Miller (1955a:161) took a Pintail on September  10 in the Sierra del Carmen.    _Anas carolinensis_ Gmelin.--The Green-winged Teal has been recorded  from northern Coahuila. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:15) recorded two  mated pairs along the Rio Grande at Lajitas, Texas, on May 10. Miller  (1955a:161) remarked that a male of the year was taken in the Sierra  del Carmen on September 4.    _Anas discors discors_ Linnaeus.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2: sex ?  31646 and sex ? 31647 from .5 mi. S Las Margaritas, 2800 ft., September  28, 1953.    The Blue-winged Teal is a fairly common spring and fall migrant in  Coahuila. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:15) noted the Blue-winged Teal at  several different localities along the Rio Grande: \"on May 8, four  males and several females resting on a mud bar along the Rio Grande  near Hot Springs [Texas]; ... on May 7, three pairs in a flock, along  the Rio Grande, Castalon [Texas]; ... and on May 20, three pairs, along  the Rio Grande, San Vicente [Texas].\" Miller (1955a:161) reported that  Marsh took a male of the year in the Sierra del Carmen on September 10.  Dickerman observed Blue-winged Teal 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos on  May 18, 1954. Olmstead listed Blue-winged Teal from 10 mi. E Hacienda  La Mariposa on March 30, 1952. Nos. 31646-31647, which are probably  females, represent the subspecies _discors_ because the light edgings  of their crowns are definitely present; the areas of their backs are  brownish, not more intensively black, and their underparts are  brownish, less blackish.    **_Anas cyanoptera septentrionalium_ Snyder and Lumsden.--Van Tyne and  Sutton (1937:15) listed several localities along the Rio Grande in  Brewster County, Texas, where Cinnamon Teal were seen. I suspect that  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:41) referred to those localities.  Dickerman saw four pairs of Cinnamon Teal 14 mi. E and 16 mi. N Ocampo  on May 9, 1954, and also saw Cinnamon Teal 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S  Americanos on May 18, 1954.    _Mareca americana_ (Gmelin).--The American Widgeon is a fairly common  spring migrant in Coahuila. Olmstead observed this duck 10 mi.

S Americanos on May 18, 1954.    _Spatula clypeata_ (Linnaeus).--The Shoveler is a spring and probably  fall migrant in Coahuila, and has been observed at several localities.  Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:16) saw two pairs along the Rio Grande at  Castalon, Texas, On May 7 and saw \"a fair-sized flock along the Rio  Grande on the Johnson ranch [in Texas] on May 13 and 14.\" Dickerman saw  12 pairs of Shovelers on two ponds 14 mi.

W Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft.,  March 26, 1952.    Miller (1955a:161) took a female Turkey Vulture, which was in breeding  condition, in the Sierra del Carmen on April 17 and stated that \"until  more statistics are available on breeding birds of northern Coahuila,  they must be considered _C. a. aura_....\" Amadon and Phillips  (1947:577) took a Turkey Vulture at Las Delicias which represented _C.  a. aura_. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:188) stated that this species was  not uncommon, and was noted each day soaring overhead both in the  valleys and over the tops of the ridges of southeastern Coahuila.    Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:47) listed _C. a. teter_ from  Coahuila. Miller (1955a:161) remarked that the subspecies _aura_ and  _teter_ might intergrade in the Sierra del Carmen. At the present time  it is possible to say only that _teter_ is present in Coahuila in  migrant and wintering populations, but the extent to which _teter_  remains in northeastern Mexico is undetermined. However, all  indications point to this area as being the region where _aura_ and  _teter_ intergrade.    **_Coragyps atratus_ (Bechstein).--The Black Vulture is locally common  throughout most of eastern Coahuila but is uncommon in the western part  of the State. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:25) noted the Black Vulture  \"regularly east of Saltillo in low country,\" but did not see Black  Vultures at San Pedro or elsewhere in southwestern Coahuila. Burleigh  and Lowery (1942:188) stated that \"the Black Vulture apparently avoids  to a large extent the higher altitudes, and only rarely was it observed  at all, even about Saltillo.\" Olmstead saw Black Vultures 8 mi. N and 4  mi. W Muzquiz, 1800 feet, on March 31, 1952, and Dickerman observed a  flock at La Gacha (=Rancho La Coucha), 1600 feet, on December 2, 1953.    **_Accipiter gentilis_ (Linnaeus).--On July 6, 1955, Hardy saw a  Goshawk 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas; this is the first record  of occurrence of this species from northeastern Mexico.    *_Accipiter striatus velox_ (Wilson).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Female] 31018, from along the Rio Grande (=Boquillas), 700 ft., March  10, 1952, measurements: wing, 207 mm.; tail, 171 mm.; tarsus, 53 mm.;  culmen, 12 mm.    Our specimen of the Sharp-shinned Hawk is referred to _velox_ on the  basis of the reddish, maculated breast, sides, and thighs. The  collector's field notes recorded the iris as blood-red. Marsh and  Stevenson (1938:286) thought that this subspecies was resident in the  pine and Douglas-fir forest of upper Vivoras Canyon of the Sierra del  Carmen at 8500 feet, where Marsh observed a family group including  three immature birds. Friedmann (1950:196) indicated that the immature  male obtained by Marsh and Stevenson is _A. s. suttoni_; Miller  (1955a:161), nevertheless, remarked that this male has well barred  feathers and thus is _velox_. Miller (_loc. cit._) obtained also an  adult male of _A. s. velox_ in the Sierra del Carmen at 7000 feet on  April 18.    **_Accipiter striatus suttoni_ van Rossem.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 32626, from 13 mi. E San Antonio, 9950 ft., July 6, 1955,  measurements: wing, 186 mm.; tail, 144 mm.; tarsus, 49 mm.; culmen, 11  mm.; weight, 103 gms.    The recording of _A. s. suttoni_ in Coahuila by Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1950:52), seems to have been based on their knowledge of the  specimen earlier mentioned by Friedmann (1950:196) and later identified  by Miller (1955a:161) as _A. s. velox_. Therefore the KU specimen seems  to be the first record of _A. s. suttoni_ in Coahuila. The size of its  testes (right, 2.5x4 mm.; left, 3x4 mm.) does not indicate breeding;  however, the time of the year in which it was obtained suggests that it  may have been a resident.    *_Accipiter cooperii_ (Bonaparte).--Miller (1955a:161) found Cooper's  Hawk breeding in the Sierra del Carmen on April 26.    _Buteo jamaicensis borealis_ (Gmelin).--The Red-tailed Hawk is common  in Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:188) noted the Red-tailed Hawk  on the higher ridges above an elevation of 6000 feet in southeastern  Coahuila. On April 17, Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._) saw two  Red-tailed Hawks \"in the open valley south of Diamante Pass\" and on  April 20, \"just outside of Saltillo,\" these workers obtained an  immature male that was referred to _B. j. borealis_.    **_Buteo jamaicensis fuertesi_ Sutton and Van Tyne.--Miller (1955a:161)  took a male Red-tailed Hawk, on April 14 at 7000 feet in the Sierra del  Carmen, that was referred to as _B. j. fuertesi_. To my knowledge,  there are no other records of this subspecies from Coahuila, but this  must be the resident form over the bulk of western Coahuila.    There are several sight records of the Red-tailed Hawk. Olmstead saw  one 16 mi. S Boquillas, 1600 feet, on March 6, 1952; Dickerman saw a  Red-tailed Hawk 16 mi. E and 18 mi. N Ocampo on May 7, 1954, one 20 mi.  S Ocampo on April 4, 1954; and an immature at Saltillo on January 17,  1954.    _Buteo platypterus platypterus_ (Vieillot).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 32628, from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9950 ft., July  6, 1955.    The Broad-winged Hawk is rare in Coahuila. No. 32628, if a migrant, was  retarded from moving northward by the loss of its right foot and distal  one-third of its tarsus. Packard (1957:371) reported this specimen as  the first record of the species in Coahuila.    *_Buteo swainsoni Bonaparte._--_Specimens examined:_ total 2: [Male]  32022 from 2 "]]]
