I'll take yu if yu bets th' other way,\" responded  Johnny, grinning. He knew Hopalong's weak spot.    \"Yore on,\" promptly responded Hopalong, who would bet on anything.      \"Well, so long,\" said Johnny as he crawled away.    \"Hey, yu, Johnny!\" called out Hopalong, \"don't yu go an' tell anybody I  got any pills left. I ain't no ars'nal.\"    Johnny replied by elevating one foot and waving it. Then he disappeared.    Behind the store, the most precarious position among the besiegers,  Red Connors and Lanky Smith were ensconced and commanded a view of the  entire length of the barroom. They could see the dark mass they knew to  be the rear door and derived a great amount of amusement from the spots  of light which were appearing in it.    They watched the \"C\" (reversed to them) appear and be completed. When  the wobbly \"H\" grew to completion they laughed heartily. Then the  hardwood bar had been dragged across the field of vision and up to the  front windows, and they could only see the indiscriminate holes which  appeared in the upper panels at frequent intervals.    Every time they fired they had to expose a part of themselves to a  return shot, with the result that Lanky's forearm was seared its entire  length. Red had been more fortunate and only had a bruised ear.    They laboriously rolled several large rocks out in the open, pushing  them beyond the shelter of the store with their rifles. When they had  crawled behind them they each had another wound. From their new position  they could see Hopalong sitting in his window. He promptly waved his  sombrero and grinned.    They were the most experienced fighters of all except Buck, and were  saving their shots. When they did shoot they always had some portion of  a man's body to aim at, and the damage they inflicted was considerable.  They said nothing, being older than the rest and more taciturn, and  they were not reckless. Although Hopalong's antics made them laugh, they  grumbled at his recklessness and were not tempted to emulate him. It was  noticeable, too, that they shoved their rifles out simultaneously and,  although both were aiming, only one fired. Lanky's gun cracked so close  to the enemy's that the whirr of the bullet over Red's head was merged  in the crack of his partner's reply.    When Hopalong saw the rocks roll out from behind the store he grew very  curious. Then he saw a flash, followed instantly by another from the  second rifle. He saw several of these follow shots and could sit in  silence no longer. He waved his hat to attract attention and then  shouted, \"How many?\" A shot was sent straight up in the air and he  notified Buck that there were only four left.    The fire of these four grew less rapid--they were saving their  ammunition. A pot shot at Hopalong sent that gentleman's rifle hurtling  to the ground. Another tore through his hat, removing a neat amount of  skin and hair and giving him a lifelong part. He fell back inside  and proceeded to shoot fast and straight with his revolvers, his head  burning as though on fire. When he had vented the dangerous pressure  of his anger he went below and tried to fish the rifle in with a long  stick. It was obdurate, so he sent three more shots into the door, and,  receiving no reply, ran out around the corner of his shelter and grasped  the weapon. When half way back he sank to the ground. Before another  shot could be fired at him with any judgment a ripping, spitting rifle  was being frantically worked from the barn. The bullets tore the door  into seams and gaps; the lowest panel, the one having the \"H\" in it,  fell inward in chunks. Johnny had returned for another smoke.    Hopalong, still grasping the rifle, rolled rapidly around the corner of  the barn. He endeavored to stand, but could not. Johnny, hearing rapid  and fluent swearing, came out.    \"Where'd they git yu?\" he asked.     \"In th' off leg.  Hurts like blazes.  Did yu git him?\"    \"Nope. I jest come fer another cig; got any left?\"    \"Up above. Yore gall is shore apallin'. Help me in, yu two-laigged  jackass.\"    \"Shore. We'll shore pay our 'tentions to that door. She'll go purty  soon--she's as full of holes as th' Bad Lan's,\" replied Johnny. \"Git  aholt an' hop along, Hopalong.\"    He helped the swearing Hopalong inside, and then the lead they pumped  into the wrecked door was scandalous. Another panel fell in and  Hopalong's \"C\" was destroyed. A wide crack appeared in the one above it  and grew rapidly. Its mate began to gape and finally both were driven  in. The increase in the light caused by these openings allowed Red and  Lanky to secure better aim and soon the fire of the defenders died out.    Johnny dropped his rifle and, drawing his six-shooter, ran out and  dashed for the dilapidated door, while Hopalong covered that opening  with a fusilade.    As Johnny's shoulder sent the framework flying inward he narrowly missed  sudden death. As it was he staggered to the side, out of range, and  dropped full length to the ground, flat on his face. Hopalong's rifle  cracked incessantly, but to no avail. The man who had fired the shot was  dead. Buck got him immediately after he had shot Johnny.    Calling to Skinny and Red to cover him, Buck sprinted to where Johnny  lay gasping. The bullet had struck his shoulder. Buck, Colt in hand,  leaped through the door, but met with no resistance. He signaled to  Hopalong, who yelled, \"They's none left.\"    The trees and rocks and gullies and buildings yielded men who soon  crowded around the hotel. A young doctor, lately graduated, appeared. It  was his first case, but he eased Johnny. Then he went over to Hopalong,  who was now raving, and attended to him. The others were patched up  as well as possible and the struggling young physician had his pockets  crammed full of gold and silver coins.    The scene of the wrecked barroom was indescribable. Holes, furrows,  shattered glass and bottles, the liquor oozing down the walls of the  shelves and running over the floor; the ruined furniture, a wrecked bar,  seared and shattered and covered with blood; bodies as they had been  piled in the corners; ropes, shells, hats; and liquor everywhere, over  everything, met the gaze of those who had caused the chaos.    Perry's Bend had failed to wipe out the score.        CHAPTER IV. The Vagrant Sioux      Buckskin gradually readjusted itself to the conditions which had existed  before its sudden leap into the limelight as a town which did things.  The soiree at the Houston House had drifted into the past, and was  now substantially established as an epoch in the history of the  town. Exuberant joy gave way to dignity and deprecation, and to solid  satisfaction; and the conversations across the bar brought forth  parallels of the affair to be judged impartially--and the impartial  judgment was, unanimously, that while there had undoubtedly been good  fights before Perry's Bend had disturbed the local quiet, they were not  quite up to the new standard of strenuous hospitality. Finally the heat  blistered everything back into the old state, and the shadows continued  to be in demand.    One afternoon, a month after the reception of the honorable delegation  from Perry's Bend, the town of Buckskin seemed desolated, and the earth  and the buildings thereon were as huge furnaces radiating a visible  heat, but when the blazing sun had begun to settle in the west it awoke  with a clamor which might have been laid to the efforts of a zealous  Satan. At this time it became the Mecca of two score or more joyous  cowboys from the neighboring ranches, who livened things as those  knights of the saddle could.    In the scant but heavy shadow of Cowan's saloon sat a picturesque figure  from whom came guttural, resonant rumblings which mingled in a spirit of  loneliness with the fretful sighs of a flea-tormented dog. Both dog and  master were vagrants, and they were tolerated because it was a matter of  supreme indifference as to who came or how long they stayed as long as  the ethics and the unwritten law of the cow country were inviolate. And  the breaking of these caused no unnecessary anxiety, for justice was  both speedy and sure.    When the outcast Sioux and his yellow dog had drifted into town some few  months before they had caused neither expostulation nor inquiry, as the  cardinal virtue of that whole broad land was to ask a man no questions  which might prove embarrassing to all concerned; judgment was of  observation, not of history, and a man's past would reveal itself  through actions. It mattered little whether he was an embezzler or the  wild chip from some prosperous eastern block, as men came to the range  to forget and to lose touch with the pampered East; and the range  absorbed them as its own.        A man was only a man as his skin contained the qualities necessary; and  the illiterate who could ride and shoot and live to himself was far more  esteemed than the educated who could not do those things. The more a man  depends upon himself and the closer is his contact to a quick judgment  the more laconic and even-poised he becomes. And the knowledge that he  is himself a judge tends to create caution and judgment. He has no court  to uphold his honor and to offer him protection, so he must be quick to  protect himself and to maintain his own standing. His nature saved him,  or it executed; and the range absolved him of all unpaid penalties of a  careless past.    He became a man born again and he took up his burden, the exactions of  a new environment, and he lived as long as those exactions gave him the  right to live. He must tolerate no restrictions of his natural rights,  and he must not restrict; for the one would proclaim him a coward,  the other a bully; and both received short shrifts in that land of the  self-protected. The basic law of nature is the survival of the fittest.    So, when the wanderers found their level in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#4)"],[1,"es--Hereford and  Shropshire, and as far as Worcestershire and Cheshire; still the  Dales of Cumberland, the Fen Country, East Anglia, and the Isle of Man  show traces of Danish blood, speech, manners, and customs; still the  slow, stolid Saxon inhabits the lands south of the Thames from Sussex  to Hampshire and Dorset. The Angle has settled permanently over the  Lowlands of Scotland, with the Celt along the western fringe, and  Flemish blood shows its traces in Pembroke on the one side (\"Little  England beyond Wales\") and in Norfolk on the other.    With all these nations, all these natures, amalgamated in our own, it  is no wonder that the literature of our isles contains many different  ideals of heroism, changing according to nationality and epoch. Thus  the physical valour of Beowulf is not the same quality as the valour  of Havelok the Dane, though both are heroes of the strong arm; and the  chivalry of Diarmit is not the same as the chivalry of Roland. Again,  religion has its share in changing the ideals of a nation, and  Constantine, the warrior of the Early English poem of \"Elene,\" is far  from being the same in character as the tender-hearted Constantine of  \"moral Gower's\" apocryphal tale. The law-abiding nature of the  earliest heroes, whose obedience to their king and their priest was  absolute, differs almost entirely from the lawlessness of Gamelyn and  Robin Hood, both of whom set church and king at defiance, and even  account it a merit to revolt from the rule of both. It follows from  this that we shall find our chosen heroes of very different types and  characters; but we shall recognise that each represented to his own  age an ideal of heroism, which that age loved sufficiently to put into  literature, and perpetuate by the best means in its power. Of many  another hero besides Arthur--of Barbarossa, of Hiawatha, even of  Napoleon--has the tradition grown that he is not dead, but has passed  away into the deathless land, whence he shall come again in his own  time. As Tennyson has sung,                    \"Great bards of him will sing      Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old      Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,      And echoed by old folk beside their fires      For comfort after their wage-work is done,      Speak of the King.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Lightfoot.

CHAPTER I: BEOWULF      Introduction    The figure which meets us as we enter on the study of Heroes of the  British Race is one which appeals to us in a very special way, since  he is the one hero in whose legend we may see the ideals of our  English forefathers before they left their Continental home to settle  in this island. Opinions may differ as to the date at which the poem  of \"Beowulf\" was written, the place in which it was localised, and the  religion of the poet who combined the floating legends into one epic  whole, but all must accept the poem as embodying the life and feelings  of our Forefathers who dwelt in North Germany on the shores of the  North Sea and of the Baltic. The life depicted, the characters  portrayed, the events described, are such as a simple warrior race  would cherish in tradition and legend as relics of the life lived by  their ancestors in what doubtless seemed to them the Golden Age.  Perhaps stories of a divine Beowa, hero and ancestor of the English,  became merged in other myths of sun-hero and marsh-demon, but in any  case the stories are now crystallized around one central human figure,  who may even be considered an historical hero, Beowulf, the thane of  Hygelac, King of the Geats. It is this grand primitive hero who  embodies the ideal of English heroism. Bold to rashness for himself,  prudent for his comrades, daring, resourceful, knowing no fear, loyal  to his king and his kinsmen, generous in war and in peace,  self-sacrificing, Beowulf stands for all that is best in manhood in an  age of strife. It is fitting that our first British hero should be  physically and mentally strong, brave to seek danger and brave to look  on death and Fate undaunted, one whose life is a struggle against  evil forces, and whose death comes in a glorious victory over the  powers of evil, a victory gained for the sake of others to whom  Beowulf feels that he owes protection and devotion.      The Story. The Coming and Passing of Scyld    Once, long ago, the Danish land owned the sway of a mighty monarch,  Scyld Scefing, the founder of a great dynasty, the Scyldings. This  great king Scyld had come to Denmark in a mysterious manner, since no  man knew whence he sprang. As a babe he drifted to the Danish shore in  a vessel loaded with treasures; but no man was with him, and there was  no token to show his kindred and race. When Scyld grew up he increased  the power of Denmark and enlarged her borders; his fame spread far and  wide among men, and his glory shone undimmed until the day when, full  of years and honours, he died, leaving the throne securely established  in his family. Then the sorrowing Danes restored him to the mysterious  ocean from which he had come to them. Choosing their goodliest ship,  they laid within it the corpse of their departed king, and heaped  around him all their best and choicest treasures, until the venerable  countenance of Scyld looked to heaven from a bed of gold and jewels;  then they set up, high above his head, his glorious gold-wrought  banner, and left him alone in state. The vessel was loosed from the  shore where the mourning Danes bewailed their departing king, and  drifted slowly away to the unknown west from which Scyld had sailed to  his now sorrowing people; they watched until it was lost in the  shadows of night and distance, but no man under heaven knoweth what  shore now holds the vanished Scyld. The descendants of Scyld ruled and  prospered till the days of his great-grandson Hrothgar, one of a  family of four, who can all be identified historically with various  Danish kings and princes.      Hrothgar's Hall    Hrothgar was a mighty warrior and conqueror, who won glory in battle,  and whose fame spread wide among men, so that nobly born warriors, his  kinsmen, were glad to serve as his bodyguard and to fight for him  loyally in strife. So great was Hrothgar's power that he longed for  some outward sign of the magnificence of his sway; he determined to  build a great hall, in which he could hold feasts and banquets, and  could entertain his warriors and thanes, and visitors from afar. The  hall rose speedily, vast, gloriously adorned, a great meeting-place  for men; for Hrothgar had summoned all his people to the work, and the  walls towered up high and majestic, ending in pinnacles and gables  resembling the antlers of a stag. At the great feast which Hrothgar  gave first in his new home the minstrels chanted the glory of the  hall, \"Heorot,\" \"The Hart,\" as the king named it; Hrothgar's desire  was well fulfilled, that he should build the most magnificent of  banquet-halls. Proud were the mighty warriors who feasted within it,  and proud the heart of the king, who from his high seat on the dais  saw his brave thanes carousing at the long tables below him, and the  lofty rafters of the hall rising black into the darkness.      Grendel    Day by day the feasting continued, until its noise and the festal joy  of its revellers aroused a mighty enemy, Grendel, the loathsome  fen-monster. This monstrous being, half-man, half-fiend, dwelt in the  fens near the hill on which Heorot stood. Terrible was he, dangerous  to men, of extraordinary strength, human in shape but gigantic of  stature, covered with a green horny skin, on which the sword would not  bite. His race, all sea-monsters, giants, goblins, and evil demons,  were offspring of Cain, outcasts from the mercy of the Most High,  hostile to the human race; and Grendel was one of mankind's most  bitter enemies; hence his hatred of the joyous shouts from Heorot, and  his determination to stop the feasting.        \"This the dire mighty fiend,    he who in darkness dwelt,      Suffered with hatred fierce,    that every day and night      He heard the festal shouts    loud in the lofty hall;      Sound of harp echoed there,    and gleeman's sweet song.      Thus they lived joyously,    fearing no angry foe      Until the hellish fiend    wrought them great woe.      Grendel that ghost was called,    grisly and terrible,      Who, hateful wanderer,    dwelt in the moorlands,      The fens and wild fastnesses;    the wretch for a while abode      In homes of the giant-race,    since God had cast him out.      When night on the earth fell,    Grendel departed      To visit the lofty hall,    now that the warlike Danes      After the gladsome feast    nightly slept in it.      A fair troop of warrior-thanes    guarding it found he;      Heedlessly sleeping,    they recked not of sorrow.      The demon of evil,    the grim wight unholy,      With his fierce ravening,    greedily grasped them,      Seized in their slumbering    thirty right manly thanes;      Thence he withdrew again,    proud of his lifeless prey,      Home to his hiding-place,    bearing his booty,      In peace to devour it.\"    [Illustration: \"The demon of evil, with his fierce ravening, greedily  grasped them\"]    When dawn broke, and the Danes from their dwellings around the hall  entered Heorot, great was the lamentation, and dire the dismay, for  thirty noble champions had vanished, and the blood-stained tracks of  the monster showed but too well the fate that had overtaken them.  Hrothgar's grief was profound, for he had lost thirty of his dearly  loved bodyguard, and he himself was too old to wage a conflict against  the foe--a foe who repeated night by night his awful deeds, in  spite of all that valour"]]]
