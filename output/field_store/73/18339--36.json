Every boy should know that chastity means  continence. He should know that lascivious thoughts lead to lascivious  actions, and that these are a drain on his system which may spoil his  life in later years.    In the education of his children the average man is only too apt to  repeat the same mistake of unconsciously crediting the child with the  possession of his own feelings and his own outlook, that is the  feelings and outlook of the adult. In general, things which may make  an impression in a sex way on the adult are a matter of indifference  to the sexually unripe boy. Hence it is quite possible for a father to  discuss sex matters with his young son and inform him constructively,  without in any undue way rousing his sex curiosity or awakening  desire. Such talks, of course, should be in accordance with the  principles already laid down in the section on \"Reproduction.\"    If a boy is accustomed and taught to regard sex conditions and matters  in a proper and innocent manner, as something perfectly natural,  improper curiosity and eroticism are far less likely to be aroused  than when this is not the case. For the whole subject will have lost  the dangerous attraction of novelty. On the other hand, we find boys  who have been brought up with great prudery and in complete ignorance  of sex matters (save that which may come to them from impure sources)  greatly excited and ashamed by the first appearance of the indications  of puberty. Secrecy is the enemy of a clean, normal conception on the  part of the child as to the right place sex and the sex function play  in life and in the world. It stands to reason, of course, that every  least detail of the sex question cannot be intelligently made clear to  a little child. But his questions should all be answered, honestly,  and with due regard for his age and his capacity to understand what is  explained to him.    One very great advantage of an early paternal explanation of sex  matters to the boy is its beneficial effect on the mind and the  nerves. Many boys brood or grow melancholy when confronted with sex  riddles and problems for which they are unable to find a solution; and  as the result of totally erroneous ideas they may have formed with  regard to sex matters. At the same time too much attention should not  be paid the discussion of sex questions between father and son. A  father should, so far as possible, endeavor to develop other interests  and preoccupations in his boy, and turn his mind as much as may be  _away_ from matters sexual, until the age when the youth is ripe for  marriage is reached.                                        CHAPTER IV                            SEX IN FEMALE CHILDHOOD                                (FROM 12 TO 14)      What has been said in general about practical observance of the laws  of sex hygiene in the preceding chapter for boys, applies to girls as  well. If anything the sex precautions taken in infancy should be even  more closely followed, as girls are by nature less robust than boys.  If children could be raised in entire accordance with natural laws,  the sexual instinct of girls as well as boys would probably remain  dormant during the period stretching from infancy to puberty. As in  the case of the boy, so in that of the girl, any manifestation of  sexual precocity should be investigated, to see whether it be due to  natural or artificial causes. In either case the proper remedies  should be applied.                              SEX PRECOCITY IN GIRLS    There are cases of extraordinary sex precocity in girls. One case  reported in the United States was that of a female child who at birth  possessed all the characteristics usually developed at puberty. In  this case the natural periodical changes began at birth! Fortunately,  this is a case more or less unique. In little girls and boys undue  sexual handling or titillating of their genital organs tends to quiet  them, so nurses (let us hope in ignorance of the consequences!) often  resort to it. Sending children to bed very early, to \"get rid of  them,\" or confining them in a room by themselves, tends to encourage  the development of vicious habits. A single bed, both in the school  and in the home, is indispensable to purity of morals and personal  cleanliness. It tends to restrain too early development of the sexual  instinct both in small girls and small boys.                            SEXUAL SELF-ABUSE IN GIRLS    Small girls, like small boys, display an intelligent curiosity as  regards the phenomena of sex at an early age. And what has already  been said regarding its improper gratification in the preceding  chapter, so far as boys are concerned, applies with equal force to  them. In their case, however, the mother is a girl's natural confidant  and friend. Self-abuse in one or another form is as common in the case  of the girl as in that of the boy. As a rule, girls who live an  outdoor life, and work with their muscles more than their mind, do not  develop undue precocious sexual curiosities or desires. At least they  do not do so to the same extent as those more nervously and  susceptibly constituted. The less delicate and sensitive children of  the country tend less to these habits than their more sensitively  organized city brothers and sisters. Girls who have formed vicious  habits are apt to indulge in the practice of self-abuse at night when  going to bed. If there is cause for suspicion, the bedclothes should  be quickly and suddenly thrown off under some pretense. Self-abuse  usually has a marked effect on the genital organs of girls. The inner  organs become unnaturally enlarged and distended, and _leucorrhea_,  catarrh of the vagina, attended by a discharge of greenish-white  mucus, often develops.                          RESULTS OF SELF-ABUSE IN GIRLS    Local diseases, due to this cause, result in girls as well as boys.  Temporary congestions become permanent, and develop into permanent  irritations and disorders. Leucorrhea has already been mentioned.  Contact with the acrid, irritating internal secretions also causes  _soreness of the fingers at the root of the nails_, and warts.  Congestion and other diseases are other ultimate results of the habit;  and these congestions to which it gives rise unduly hasten the advent  of puberty. Any _decided enlargement of the labia and clitoris in a  young girl_ may be taken as a positive evidence of the existence of  the habit of self-abuse. Sterility, and atrophy of the breasts--their  deficient development--when the vice is begun before puberty, is  another result.                     PRURITIS AND FEMININE NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS    _Pruritis_ (itching genitals), though not necessarily caused by  self-abuse, may be one of its consequences. Continued congestion  causes the genital parts to itch terribly. This itching increases  until the desire to manipulate the genitals becomes irresistible. It  will then be indulged in even in the presence of strangers, though the  girl in question at other times may be exceptionally modest. Girls  addicted to the vice also suffer from nocturnal emissions. The general  effect of self-abuse is much the same in the case of a girl as in that  of a boy, for leucorrhea is injurious in somewhat the same fashion as  seminal loss. In the case of girls the greatest injury, however, is  due to the nervous exhaustion which succeeds the unnatural excitement.                      WHAT MOTHERS SHOULD DO FOR THEIR GIRLS    A healthy girl should be happy and comfortable in all respects. She  will not be so, especially with regard to her sex problems, unless she  can appeal to her mother as a friend and confidant. While keeping your  girl's mind pure and healthy by precept and example, do not forget  that the best way to protect her against evil influences and  communications is to tell her the exact truth about sex facts, as they  apply to her, just as the father should his boy. Keep your girl fully  occupied and do not leave her sex education to the evil winds of  chance.    Let sex knowledge take its place as a proper, necessary part of her  general education. If your daughter feels she can at all times talk  freely to you all will be well. Gratify her natural sex curiosity in a  natural way. See that _immediate_ medical attention is given  inflammations, excoriations, itchings and swellings of her genital  organs. Such conditions will lead her to rub and scratch these  parts--never to be touched--for relief. If, as a result of the  sensations experienced, masturbation results, _yours is the sin_.                                         CHAPTER V                          SEX IN THE ADOLESCENT MALE                          (FROM PUBERTY TO MATURITY)      Adolescence is the period when the boy is lost in the man. It is the  time of life embraced between the ages of fourteen or sixteen and the  age of twenty-five. Every boy, if properly trained, should reach this  period in a state of good general health and spirits. Hitherto he has  been led and guided. Now he must develop mental strength and will  power himself to choose the good and refuse the evil in the sexual  problems confronting him.                                      PUBERTY    According to climate puberty, the age when the human male becomes  sexually perfect, varies from ten to fifteen years. In the United  States puberty in the male usually occurs at the age of fourteen and a  half years. In tropical climates it occurs at nine or ten, and in cold  countries, such as Norway and Siberia, it may not take place until  eighteen or nineteen. Vigorous physical exercise tends to delay  puberty, anything exciting the emotions tends to hasten it.  Stimulating foods, pepper, vinegar, mustard, spices, tea and coffee,  excess meat nutriment hasten puberty. A cool, unstimulating vegetable  and farinaceous diet may delay the development of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23691"],[0,"Archeological Expedition to Arizona in 1895 (#4)"],[1,"the sites of many and  populous pueblos, while the neighboring mesas from one end to another  are riddled with cavate dwellings or crowned with stone buildings.  Northward from that famous crater-like depression in the Verde region,  the so-called Montezuma Well on Beaver creek, one of the affluents of  the Rio Verde, little archeological exploration had been attempted.  There was, in other words, a break in the almost continuous series of  ruins from Tusayan as far south as the Gila. Ruined towns had been  reported as existing not far southward from San Francisco  mountains,[5] and from there by easy stages the abodes of a former  race had been detected at intervals all the way to the Tusayan  pueblos. At either end the chain of ruins between the Tusayan towns  and the Gila ruins was unbroken, but middle links were wanting. All  conditions imply former habitations in this untrodden hiatus, the  region between the Verde and the Tusayan series, ending near the  present town of Flagstaff, Arizona; but southward from that town the  country was broken and impassable, a land where the foot of the  archeologist had not trodden. Remains of human habitations had,  however, been reported by ranchmen, but these reports were vague and  unsatisfactory. So far as they went they confirmed my suspicions, and  there were other significant facts looking the same way. The color of  the red cliffs fulfilled the Tusayan tradition of Palatkwabi, or their  former home in the far south. Led by all these considerations, before  I took to the field I had long been convinced that this must have been  one of the homes of certain Hopi clans, and when the occasion  presented itself I determined to follow the northward extension of the  ancient people of the Verde into these rugged rocks. By my discoveries  in this region of ruins indicative of dwellings of great size in  ancient times I have supplied the missing links in the chain of  ancient dwellings extending from the great towns of the Gila to the  ruins west of the modern Tusayan towns. If this line of ruins,  continuous from Gila valley to Tusayan and beyond, be taken in  connection with legends ascribing Casa Grande to the Hopi and those of  certain Tusayan clans which tell of the homes of their ancestors in  the south, a plausible explanation is offered for the many  similarities between two apparently widely different peoples, and the  theory of a kinship between southern and northern sedentary tribes of  Arizona does not seem as unlikely as it might otherwise appear.    The reader will notice that I accept without question the belief that  the so-called cliff dwellers were not a distinct people, but a  specially adaptive condition of life of a race whose place of  habitation was determined by its environment. We are considering a  people who sometimes built dwellings in caverns and sometimes in the  plains, but often in both places at the same epoch. Moreover, as long  ago pointed out by other students, the existing Pueblo Indians are  descendants of a people who at times lived in cliffs, and some of the  Tusayan clans have inhabited true cliff houses in the historic period.  By intermarriage with nomadic races and from other causes the  character of Pueblo consanguinity is no doubt somewhat different from  that of their ancient kin, but the character of the culture, as shown  by a comparison of cliff-house and modern objects, has not greatly  changed.    While recognizing the kinship of the Pueblos and the Cliff villagers,  this resemblance is not restricted to any one pueblo or group of  modern pueblos to the exclusion of others. Of all modern  differentiations of this ancient substratum of culture of which cliff  villages are one adaptive expression, the Tusayan Indians are the  nearest of all existing people of the Southwest[6] to the ancient  people of Arizona.    The more southerly ruins of Tusayan, which I have been able  satisfactorily to identify and to designate by a Hopi name, are those  called Homolobi, situated not far from Winslow, Arizona, near where  the railroad crosses the Little Colorado. These ruins are claimed by  the Hopi as the former residences of their ancestors, and were halting  places in the migration of certain clans from the south. They were  examined by Mr Cosmos Mindeleff, of the Bureau of American Ethnology,  in 1893,[7] but no report on them has yet been published.    While, however, the Homolobi group of ruins is the most southerly to  which I have been able to affix a Hopi name, others still more to the  southward are claimed by certain of their traditions.[8] The Hopi  likewise regard as homes of their ancestors certain habitations, now  in ruins, near San Francisco mountains. In a report on his exploration  of Zuni and Little Colorado rivers in 1852, Captain L. Sitgreaves  called attention to several interesting ruins, one of which was not  far from the \"cascades\" of the latter river. After ascending the  plateau, which he found covered with volcanic detritus, he discovered  that \"all the prominent points\" were \"occupied by the ruins of stone  houses, which were in some instances three stories in height. They are  evidently,\" he says, \"the remains of a large town, as they occurred at  intervals for an extent of eight or nine miles, and the ground was  thickly strewn with fragments of pottery in all directions.\"    In 1884 a portion of Colonel James Stevenson's expedition, under F. D.  Bickford, examined the cliff houses in Walnut canyon, and in 1886  Major J. W. Powell and Colonel Stevenson found scattered ruins north  of San Francisco mountains having one, two, or three rooms, each  \"built of basaltic cinders and blocks of lava.\" These explorers  likewise reported ruins of extensive dwellings in the same region  made of sandstone and limestone. At about 25 miles north of the  mountains mentioned they discovered a small volcanic cone of cinders  and basalt, which was formerly the site of a village or pueblo built  around a crater, and estimated that this little pueblo contained 60 or  70 rooms, with a plaza occupying one-third of an acre of surface.[9]    Twelve miles eastward from San Francisco mountains they found another  cinder cone resembling a dome, and on its southern slope, in a  coherent cinder mass, were many chambers, of which one hundred and  fifty are said to have been excavated. They mention the existence on  the summit of this cone of a plaza inclosed by a rude wall of volcanic  cinders, with a carefully leveled floor. The former inhabitants of  these rooms apparently lived in underground chambers hewn from the  volcanic formation. Eighteen miles farther eastward was another ruined  village built about the crater of a volcanic cone. Several villages  were discovered in this locality and many natural caves which had been  utilized as dwellings by inclosing them in front with walls of  volcanic rocks and cinders. These cavate rooms were arranged tier  above tier in a very irregular way.    At this place three distinct kinds of ruins were found--cliff  villages, cave dwellings, and pueblos. Eight miles southeastward from  Flagstaff, in Oak creek canyon, a cliff house of several hundred rooms  was discovered. It was concluded that all these ruins were abandoned  at a comparatively recent date, or not more than three or four  centuries ago, and the Havasupai Indians of Cataract canyon were  regarded as descendants of the former inhabitants of these villages.  The situation of some of these ruins and the published descriptions  would indicate that some of them were similar to those described and  figured by Sitgreaves,[10] to which reference has already been made.    In 1896 two amateur explorers, George Campbell and Everett Howell, of  Flagstaff, reported that they had found, about eighteen miles from  that place, several well-preserved cliff towns and a remarkable tunnel  excavation. The whole region in the immediate neighborhood of San  Francisco mountains appears, therefore, to have been populated in  ancient times by an agricultural people, and legends ascribe some of  these ruins to ancestors of the Hopi Indians.    There are several ruins due south of Tusayan which have not been  investigated, but which would furnish important contributions to a  study of Hopi migrations. Near Saint Johns, Arizona, likewise, there  are ruins of considerable size, possibly referable to the Cibolan  series; and south of Holbrook, which lies about due south of Walpi,  there are ruins, the pottery from which I have examined and found to  be of the black-and-white ware typical of the Cliff people. Perhaps,  however, no ruined pueblo presents more interesting problems than the  magnificent Pueblo Grande or Kintiel, about 20 miles north of Navaho  Springs. This large ruin, lying between the Cibolan and Tusayan  groups, has been referred to both of these provinces, and would, if  properly excavated, shed much light on the archeology of the two  provinces.[11] Kinnazinde lies not far from Kintiel.    The ruins reported from Tonto Basin, of which little is known, may  later be found to be connected with early migrations of those Hopi  clans which claim southern origin. From what I can judge by the  present appearance of ruins just north of the Mogollon mountains, in a  direct line between Tonto Basin and the present Tusayan towns, there  is nothing to show the age of these ruined villages, and it is quite  likely that they may have been inhabited in the middle of the  sixteenth century. While it is commonly agreed that the province of  \"Totonteac,\" which figures extensively in certain early Spanish  narratives, was the same as Tusayan, the linguistic similarity of the  word to \"tonto\" has been suggested by others. In the troublesome years  between 1860 and 1870 the Hopi, decimated by disease and harried by  nomads, sent delegates to Prescott asking to be removed to Tonto  Basin, and it is not improbable that in making this reasonable request  they "]]]
