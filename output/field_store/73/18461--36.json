Occasionally suspicion is aroused, the public has its doubts, and vague  rumours hover round him; but he burrows under new impostures, and  punishment passes by. When he falls into the hands of human justice his  reputation protects him, and for a few days more the legal sword is  turned aside. Hypocrisy is so completely a part of his nature, that even  when there is no longer any hope, when he is irrevocably sentenced, and  he knows that he can no longer deceive anyone, neither mankind nor Him  whose name he profanes by this last sacrilege, he yet exclaims, \"O  Christ! I shall suffer even as Thou.\" It is only by the light of his  funeral pyre that the dark places of his life can be examined, that this  bloody plot is unravelled, and that other victims, forgotten and lost in  the shadows, arise like spectres at the foot of the scaffold, and escort  the assassin to his doom.    Let us trace rapidly the history of Derues' early years, effaced and  forgotten in the notoriety of his death. These few pages are not written  for the glorification of crime, and if in our own days, as a result of  the corruption of our manners, and of a deplorable confusion of all  notions of right and wrong, it has been sought to make him an object; of  public interest, we, on our part, only wish to bring him into notice,  and place him momentarily on a pedestal, in order to cast him still  lower, that his fall may be yet greater. What has been permitted by God  may be related by man. Decaying and satiated communities need not be  treated as children; they require neither diplomatic handling nor  precaution, and it may be good that they should see and touch the  putrescent sores which canker them. Why fear to mention that which  everyone knows? Why dread to sound the abyss which can be measured by  everyone? Why fear to bring into the light of day unmasked wickedness,  even though it confronts the public gaze unblushingly? Extreme turpitude  and extreme excellence are both in the schemes of Providence; and the  poet has summed up eternal morality for all ages and nations in this  sublime exclamation:        \"Abstulit hunc tandem Rufini poem tumultum.\"    Besides, and we cannot insist too earnestly that our intention must not  be mistaken, if we had wished to inspire any other sentiment than that  of horror, we should have chosen a more imposing personage from the  annals of crime. There have been deeds which required audacity, a sort  of grandeur, a false heroism; there have been criminals who held in  check all the regular and legitimate forces of society, and whom one  regarded with a mixture of terror and pity. There is nothing of that in  Derues, not even a trace of courage; nothing but a shameless cupidity,  exercising itself at first in the theft of a few pence filched from the  poor; nothing but the illicit gains and rascalities of a cheating  shopkeeper and vile money-lender, a depraved cowardice which dared not  strike openly, but slew in the dark. It is the story of an unclean  reptile which drags itself underground, leaving everywhere the trail of  its poisonous saliva.    Such was the man whose life we have undertaken to narrate, a man who  represents a complete type of wickedness, and who corresponds to the  most hideous sketch ever devised by poet or romance-writer: Facts  without importance of their own, which would be childish if recorded of  anyone else, obtain a sombre reflection from other facts which precede  them, and thenceforth cannot be passed over in silence. The historian is  obliged to collect and note them, as showing the logical development of  this degraded being: he unites them in sequence, and counts the  successive steps of the ladder mounted by the criminal.    We have seen the early exploit of this assassin by instinct; we find  him, twenty years later, an incendiary and a fraudulent bankrupt. What  had happened in the interval? With how much treachery and crime had he  filled this space of twenty years? Let us return to his infancy.    His unconquerable taste for theft caused him to be expelled by the  relations who had taken charge of him. An anecdote is told which shows  his impudence and incurable perversity. One day he was caught taking  some money, and was soundly whipped by his cousins. When this was over,  the child, instead of showing any sorrow or asking forgiveness, ran away  with a sneer, and seeing they were out of breath, exclaimed--    \"You are tired, are you? Well, I am not!\"    Despairing of any control over this evil disposition, the relations  refused to keep him, and sent him to Chartres, where two other cousins  agreed to have him, out of charity. They were simpleminded women, of  great and sincere piety, who imagined that good example and religious  teaching might have a happy influence on their young relation. The  result was contrary to their expectation: the sole fruit of their  teaching was that Derues learnt to be a cheat and a hypocrite, and to  assume the mask of respectability.    Here also repeated thefts insured him sound corrections. Knowing his  cousins' extreme economy, not to say avarice, he mocked them when they  broke a lath over his shoulders: \"There now, I am so glad; that will  cost you two farthings!\"    His benefactresses' patience becoming exhausted, he left their house,  and was apprenticed to a tinman at Chartres. His master died, and an  ironmonger of the same town took him as shop-boy, and from this he  passed on to a druggist and grocer. Until now, although fifteen years  old, he had shown no preference for one trade more than another, but it  was now necessary he should choose some profession, and his share in the  family property amounted to the modest sum of three thousand five  hundred livres. His residence with this last master revealed a decided  taste, but it was only another evil instinct developing itself: the  poisoner had scented poison, being always surrounded with drugs which  were health-giving or hurtful, according to the use made of them. Derues  would probably have settled at Chartres, but repeated thefts obliged him  to leave the town. The profession of druggist and grocer being one which  presented most chances of fortune, and being, moreover, adapted to his  tastes, his family apprenticed him to a grocer in the rue Comtesse  d'Artois, paying a specified premium for him.    Derues arrived in Paris in 1760. It was a new horizon, where he was  unknown; no suspicion attached to him, and he felt much at his ease.  Lost in the noise and the crowd of this immense receptacle for every  vice, he had time to found on hypocrisy his reputation as an honest man.  When his apprenticeship expired, his master proposed to place him with  his sister-in-law, who kept a similar establishment in the rue St.  Victor, and who had been a widow for several years. He recommended  Derues as a young man whose zeal and intelligence might be useful in her  business, being ignorant of various embezzlements committed by his late  apprentice, who was always clever enough to cast suspicion on others.  But the negotiation nearly fell through, because, one day, Derues so far  forgot his usual prudence and dissimulation as to allow himself to make  the observation recorded above to his mistress. She, horrified, ordered  him to be silent, and threatened to ask her husband to dismiss him. It  required a double amount of hypocrisy to remove this unfavourable  impression; but he spared no pains to obtain the confidence of the  sister-in-law, who was much influenced in his favour. Every day he  inquired what could be done for her, every evening he took a basket-load  of the goods she required from the rue Comtesse d'Artois; and it excited  the pity of all beholders to see this weakly young man, panting and  sweating under his heavy burden, refusing any reward, and labouring  merely for the pleasure of obliging, and from natural kindness of heart!  The poor widow, whose spoils he was already coveting, was completely  duped. She rejected the advice of her brother-in-law, and only listened  to the concert of praises sung by neighbours much edified by Derues'  conduct, and touched by the interest he appeared to show her. Often he  found occasion to speak of her, always with the liveliest expressions of  boundless devotion. These remarks were repeated to the good woman, and  seemed all the more sincere to her as they appeared to have been made  quite casually, and she never suspected they were carefully calculated  and thought out long before.    Derues carried dishonesty as far as possible, but he knew how to stop  when suspicion was likely to be aroused, and though always planning  either to deceive or to hurt, he was never taken by surprise. Like the  spider which spreads the threads of her web all round her, he concealed  himself in a net of falsehood which one had to traverse before arriving  at his real nature. The evil destiny of this poor woman, mother of four  children, caused her to engage him as her shopman in the year 1767,  thereby signing the warrant for her own ruin.    Derues began life under his new mistress with a master-stroke. His  exemplary piety was the talk of the whole quarter, and his first care  had been to request Madame Legrand to recommend him a confessor. She  sent him to the director of her late husband, Pere Cartault, of the  Carmelite order, who, astonished at the devotion of his penitent, never  failed, if he passed the shop, to enter and congratulate Madame Legrand  on the excellent acquisition she had made in securing this young man,  who would certainly bring her a blessing along with him. Derues affected  the greatest modesty, and blushed at these praises, and often, when he  saw the good father approaching, appeared not to see him, and found  something to do elsewhere; whereby the field was left clear for his too  credulous panegyrists.    But Pere Cartault appeared too indulgent, and Derues feared that his"]]]
