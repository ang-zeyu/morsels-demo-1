Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with  them, and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken  over with the house.  A good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx  and Co., High Holborn, had been left behind.  Telegraphic inquiries had  been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer  save that he was a good payer.  Odds and ends, some pipes, a few  novels, two of them in Spanish, an old-fashioned pinfire revolver, and  a guitar were among the personal property.    \"Nothing in all this,\" said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from room  to room.  \"But now, Mr. Holmes, I invite your attention to the kitchen.\"    It was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the back of the house, with a  straw litter in one corner, which served apparently as a bed for the  cook.  The table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates, the  debris of last night's dinner.    \"Look at this,\" said Baynes.  \"What do you make of it?\"    He held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the  back of the dresser.  It was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that  it was difficult to say what it might have been. One could but say that  it was black and leathery and that it bore some resemblance to a  dwarfish, human figure.  At first, as I examined it, I thought that it  was a mummified negro baby, and then it seemed a very twisted and  ancient monkey.  Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was  animal or human.  A double band of white shells were strung round the  centre of it.    \"Very interesting--very interesting, indeed!\" said Holmes, peering at  this sinister relic.  \"Anything more?\"    In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle.  The limbs and body of some large, white bird, torn savagely to pieces  with the feathers still on, were littered all over it.  Holmes pointed  to the wattles on the severed head.    \"A white cock,\" said he.  \"Most interesting!  It is really a very  curious case.\"    But Mr. Baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last. From  under the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood.  Then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of  charred bone.    \"Something has been killed and something has been burned.  We raked all  these out of the fire.  We had a doctor in this morning.  He says that  they are not human.\"    Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands.    \"I must congratulate you, Inspector, on handling so distinctive and  instructive a case.  Your powers, if I may say so without offence, seem  superior to your opportunities.\"    Inspector Baynes's small eyes twinkled with pleasure.    \"You're right, Mr. Holmes.  We stagnate in the provinces.  A case of  this sort gives a man a chance, and I hope that I shall take it.  What  do you make of these bones?\"    \"A lamb, I should say, or a kid.\"    \"And the white cock?\"    \"Curious, Mr. Baynes, very curious.  I should say almost unique.\"    \"Yes, sir, there must have been some very strange people with some very  strange ways in this house.  One of them is dead.  Did his companions  follow him and kill him?  If they did we should have them, for every  port is watched.  But my own views are different.  Yes, sir, my own  views are very different.\"    \"You have a theory then?\"    \"And I'll work it myself, Mr. Holmes.  It's only due to my own credit  to do so.  Your name is made, but I have still to make mine.  I should  be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your  help.\"    Holmes laughed good-humoredly.    \"Well, well, Inspector,\" said he. \"Do you follow your path and I will  follow mine.  My results are always very much at your service if you  care to apply to me for them.  I think that I have seen all that I wish  in this house, and that my time may be more profitably employed  elsewhere.  Au revoir and good luck!\"    I could tell by numerous subtle signs, which might have been lost upon  anyone but myself, that Holmes was on a hot scent.  As impassive as  ever to the casual observer, there were none the less a subdued  eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker  manner which assured me that the game was afoot.  After his habit he  said nothing, and after mine I asked no questions.  Sufficient for me  to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without  distracting that intent brain with needless interruption.  All would  come round to me in due time.    I waited, therefore--but to my ever-deepening disappointment I waited  in vain.  Day succeeded day, and my friend took no step forward.  One  morning he spent in town, and I learned from a casual reference that he  had visited the British Museum.  Save for this one excursion, he spent  his days in long and often solitary walks, or in chatting with a number  of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated.    \"I'm sure, Watson, a week in the country will be invaluable to you,\" he  remarked.  \"It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the  hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again. With a spud, a tin  box, and an elementary book on botany, there are instructive days to be  spent.\"  He prowled about with this equipment himself, but it was a  poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening.    Occasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes.  His fat,  red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he  greeted my companion.  He said little about the case, but from that  little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of  events.  I must admit, however, that I was somewhat surprised when,  some five days after the crime, I opened my morning paper to find in  large letters:        THE OXSHOTT MYSTERY      A SOLUTION      ARREST OF SUPPOSED ASSASSIN    Holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when I read the  headlines.    \"By Jove!\" he cried.  \"You don't mean that Baynes has got him?\"    \"Apparently,\" said I as I read the following report:    \"Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district  when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in  connection with the Oxshott murder.  It will be remembered that Mr.  Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, was found dead on Oxshott Common, his body  showing signs of extreme violence, and that on the same night his  servant and his cook fled, which appeared to show their participation  in the crime.  It was suggested, but never proved, that the deceased  gentleman may have had valuables in the house, and that their  abstraction was the motive of the crime.  Every effort was made by  Inspector Baynes, who has the case in hand, to ascertain the hiding  place of the fugitives, and he had good reason to believe that they had  not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already  prepared.  It was certain from the first, however, that they would  eventually be detected, as the cook, from the evidence of one or two  tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window, was a  man of most remarkable appearance--being a huge and hideous mulatto,  with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type.  This man has  been seen since the crime, for he was detected and pursued by Constable  Walters on the same evening, when he had the audacity to revisit  Wisteria Lodge.  Inspector Baynes, considering that such a visit must  have some purpose in view and was likely, therefore, to be repeated,  abandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery.  The man  walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in  which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage.  We understand  that when the prisoner is brought before the magistrates a remand will be  applied for by the police, and that great developments are hoped from  his capture.\"    \"Really we must see Baynes at once,\" cried Holmes, picking up his hat.  \"We will just catch him before he starts.\"  We hurried down the village  street and found, as we had expected, that the inspector was just  leaving his lodgings.    \"You've seen the paper, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked, holding one out to us.    \"Yes, Baynes, I've seen it.  Pray don't think it a liberty if I give  you a word of friendly warning.\"    \"Of warning, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"I have looked into this case with some care, and I am not convinced  that you are on the right lines.  I don't want you to commit yourself  too far unless you are sure.\"    \"You're very kind, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"I assure you I speak for your good.\"    It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over  one of Mr. Baynes's tiny eyes.    \"We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr. Holmes.  That's what I am  doing.\"    \"Oh, very good,\" said Holmes.  \"Don't blame me.\"    \"No, sir; I believe you mean well by me.  But we all have our own  systems, Mr. Holmes.  You have yours, and maybe I have mine.\"    \"Let us say no more about it.\"    \"You're welcome always to my news.  This fellow is a perfect savage, as  strong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil.  He chewed Downing's  thumb nearly off before they could master him. He hardly speaks a word  of English, and we can get nothing out of him but grunts.\"    \"And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master?\"    \"I didn't say so, Mr. Holmes; I didn't say so.  We all have our little  ways.  You try yours and I will try mine.  That's the agreement.\"    Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together.  \"I can't  make the man out.  He seems to be riding for a fall.  Well, as he says,  we must each try our own way and see what comes of it.  But there's  something in Inspector Baynes which I can't quite understand.\"    \"Just sit down in that chair, Watson,\" said Sherlock Holmes when we had  returned to our apartment at the Bull.  \"I want to put you in touch  with the situation, as I may need your help to-night.

CHAPTER III    THE GRASSHOPPER      The grasshopper or locust is one of the most ancient plagues of  cultivated crops. From the earliest time they have destroyed crops.  During Moses' sojourn in Egypt they were so destructive as to cause  severe famine and various other references to their destructive work are  to be found in the early writings. Since those early days, just think of  the crops that have disappeared between the greedy jaws of grasshoppers!    In our own country it has not been many years since the sun was darkened  for days by clouds of grasshoppers as they settled down from the Rocky  Mountains upon the growing crops in the neighboring states. One day a  field might have a promising crop and by the next day it might be left  as bare as a dry stubble field in August. Those days of great  destruction in America have largely passed but each year the active jaws  of \"hoppers\" devour a handsome fortune.    [Illustration: Common differential locust or grasshopper; a, egg nests  underground; b, young nymph; c, d, older nymphs; e, adult grasshopper;  f, nymph feeding on grass. This shows development with incomplete  metamorphosis.]    In the same order with the grasshoppers come the crickets, katydids,  rear-horses, devil's darning-needles or walking-sticks, and cockroaches.  The grasshoppers are most troublesome, however. They deposit eggs in the  ground and in other protected places. In the spring these hatch into  young \"hoppers\" scarcely larger than a pin head at first. Throughout the  early summer these small fellows feed and increase in size. They burst  their old skins and crawl out of them a number of times as they grow  larger. Toward fall they become full grown with four strong wings and  very powerful hind legs for jumping. In this condition most of the  common grasshoppers will be found in the fall when the rural schools  open.      FIELD STUDIES    The small so-called red-legged grasshopper is always most abundant in  the fall and for this reason we have selected it for our studies. It is  about an inch long, olive-brown in color with the ends of the hind legs  bright red. It is found everywhere in pastures, meadows and along  country roads. Approach one of them in the field and see what happens.  How does it get away? When disturbed, how far does it go? Does it hide  in the grass when you try to catch it? Observe one that has not been  disturbed. Where do you find it; on the ground or on plants? How does it  move about when not scared? Watch carefully and see what plants it feeds  on. How does it go about it? What do you find feeding on grasshoppers?  How does a turkey catch them? Have you ever seen a dull colored fly,  which inhabits dry paths and which flies with a humming sound like a  bee, feeding on grasshoppers? These are called \"robber-flies\" or  \"spider-hawks\" and they destroy thousands of grasshoppers.      BREEDING CAGE OBSERVATIONS    After you have learned all you can about the habits of the grasshopper  in the field, catch a few of them and take them home and put them in a  glass fruit jar. Collect green leaves for them and watch them feed.  Watch their method of feeding closely and see how it differs from that  of a horse or a cow. How do they move about in the jar? Which legs are  used in walking? What do they do with the jumping legs while walking? Do  they use their wings at all while in the jar? Watch them wash their face  and feet after feeding. Give them leaves of different plants, especially  of field and garden crops and determine which they like best. Can you  find any plant which they will not eat? Find out how fast they feed and  considering the life of any one individual to be 200 days, calculate the  number of grass blades each individual may eat. Are the feelers used  while in the jar, and if so for what purpose?      STUDY OF SPECIMEN    Take a grasshopper from the jar and examine it carefully. Count the  number of legs, wings and joints in the body. How many joints in the  legs? Examine the tip of the foot for a soft pad and on either side of  it a strong hook. What are these used for? What are the sharp spines on  the side of the hind-legs for? Examine the side of the body and see if  you can find the small breathing pores. How do the legs join the body?  Where are the wings attached? How broad are the wings as compared with  the body? How are they folded? Are the two pairs of wings alike? Which  is used most in flying? Is the head firmly attached to the body? Examine  the large eyes; where are they found? Will grasshoppers bite you while  handling them? What is the brown juice which escapes from the mouth when  disturbed? How long are the feelers as compared with the body? Can you  tell the males from the females? What is the distinction? Do they ever  make music? Examine for all the foregoing points and write a brief  report covering these. Make a careful drawing of a grasshopper from one  side; also make an enlarged drawing of the face of a grasshopper and  name the parts.          CHAPTER IV    THE HOUSE FLY OR TYPHOID FLY      In the house fly we find one of man's most deadly foes. War can not  compare with the campaigns of disease and death waged by this most  filthy of all insects. In our recent strife with Spain we lost a few  lives in battle, but we lost many more in hospitals due to contagious  diseases, in the transmission of which this pest played a most important  part.    The fly is dangerous on account of its filthy habits. It breeds in  filth, feeds on filth in open closets, slop-barrels, on the streets and  in back alleys and then comes into the house and wipes this germ-laden  filth on our food or on the hands or even in the mouths of helpless  babies. Who has not seen flies feeding on running sores on animals, or  on \"spit\" on sidewalks? These same flies the next minute may be feeding  on fruits or other food materials. We rebel when pests destroy our crops  or attack our stock, but here we have a pest which endangers our very  lives, and the lives of those dear to us.    If the fly confined itself to filth we could overlook it as it would  help to hasten the removal of filth. On the other hand, if it avoided  filth and remained in our home we could not overlook it, but we could  feel safe that it was not apt to do us a great deal of harm. But, like  the English sparrow, one minute it is here and the next somewhere else;  from filth to foods and then back again to filth. In this way it carries  disease germs upon its feet and other parts of its body and by coming in  contact with food material some of these germs are sure to be left on it  and cause trouble later. The fly's method of carrying disease is  different from that of the mosquito where the germ is carried inside its  body.    [Illustration: House fly; a, larva or maggot; b, pupa; c, adult; e, egg.  All enlarged. (Modified from Howard Bur. of Entomology. U. S. Dept.  Agri.)]    The presence of flies in the home is usually a sign of untidiness; but  it means more, it means that disease and often death is hovering over  the home. We are too apt to consider the fly simply as a nuisance when  we should take it more seriously. The child should be led to realize  that the fly should not be tolerated in the home, that it is dangerous  and that it can and must be destroyed.    The house fly may pass the winter either as the adult fly in cracks and  crannies about the home, or in out-buildings or it may remain as a  hard, brown, oval pupa in stables and manure piles when, with the first  warm days of spring, it escape from this case as the fly ready to lay  eggs for the first colony. The fly breeds largely in horse manure either  in stables, manure piles or in street gutters where manure is allowed to  collect. Each female lays a large number of eggs and since it requires  less than two weeks for the pest to mature, we are soon overrun with  flies in the summer where steps are not taken to control them. The  maggots are often so abundant in stables that they can be scooped out  with a shovel. This ceaseless breeding continues from spring until the  first frost in the fall.    [Illustration: Favorite breeding places of house fly. Such places should  be kept as clean and neat as the front yard.]    In the control of the fly and prevention of trouble from it there are  three important steps to take. First of all, go to the source of the  trouble and do away with or screen all breeding places. Then, by keeping  in mind the fact that the fly is comparatively harmless as long as it is  kept from filth laden with germs, do away with all open closets,  uncovered slop-barrels and other filth. As a further precaution keep it  from the home by the use of screens and when necessary \"swatters.\" Do  not make the mistake of trying to control the pest with the \"swatters\"  alone. In the country too often manure is permitted to accumulate about  the barn during the summer with a view of using it on wheat ground in  the fall and this furnishes ideal conditions for the fly to breed.  Another source of constant danger especially in the rural districts is  the presence of open closets or worse still the presence of no closet at  all. This is without doubt the most dangerous accessory of the farm.  More screens should be used in the home and greater care in keeping them  closed.    [Illustration: An open closet to which the house fly has free access.  Such a closet is the most dangerous accessory of any home.]      STUDY OF THE FLY AND ITS WORK    Observe first of all the feeding habits of the fly. What foods in the  home is it most fond of? Make a list of all the food materials it is  found to feed on. Where and on what is it found feeding out doors? Do  you find it feeding on filth and if so, on what? Do you find it about  the barn? Where is it usually found in the barn? How can the fly carry  filth to food materials?    In studying the breeding of the fly determine"]]]
