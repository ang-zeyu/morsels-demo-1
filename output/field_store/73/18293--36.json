And indeed he quoted Latin, even with the  tears standing in his eyes, as he first shook Edward by the hand and  then embraced him in the foreign fashion on both cheeks--all to express  the immense pleasure it was to receive in his house of Tully-Veolan \"a  worthy scion of the old stock of Waverley-Honour.\"    While Miss Rose ran off to make some changes in her dress, the Baron  conducted Edward into a hall hung about with pikes and armour. Four or  five servants, in old-fashioned livery, received them with honour, the  majordomo at their head. The butler-gardener was not to be caught  napping a second time.    Bradwardine took Captain Waverley at once into an old dining room all  panelled with black oak, round the walls of which hung pictures of  former chiefs of the line of Tully-Veolan. Somewhere out-of-doors a bell  was ringing to announce the arrival of other guests, and Edward observed  with some interest that the table was laid for six people. In such a  desolate country it seemed difficult to imagine where they would arrive  from.    Upon this point Edward soon received enlightenment. First, there was the  Laird of Balmawhapple,--\"a discreet young gentleman,\" said the Baron,  \"much given to field sports.\" Next came the Laird of Killancureit, who  cultivated his own fields and cared for his own cattle--thereby (quoth  the Baron) showing the commonness of his origin. Added to these were a  \"non-juring\" Episcopal minister--that is, one who had refused to take  the oaths of allegiance to King George's government, and, last of all,  the \"Baron-Bailie\" or land-steward of Bradwardine, one Mr. Macwheeble.    This last, to show his consciousness of his inferior position, seated  himself as far as possible from the table, and as often as he wanted to  eat, he bent himself nearly double over his plate, in the shape of a  clasp-knife about to shut. When dinner was over, Rose and the clergyman  discreetly retired, when, with a sign to the butler, the Baron of  Bradwardine produced out of a locked case a golden cup called the  Blessed Bear of Bradwardine, in which first the host and then all the  company pledged the health of the young English stranger. After a while,  the Baron and Edward set out to see their guests a certain distance on  their way, going with them down the avenue to the village \"change-house\"  or inn, where Balmawhapple and Killancureit had stabled their horses.    Edward, being weary, would much rather have found himself in bed, but  this desertion of good company the Baron would noways allow. So under  the low cobwebbed roof of Lucky Macleary's kitchen the four gentlemen  sat down to \"taste the sweets of the night.\" But it was not long before  the wine began to do its work in their heads. Each one of them, Edward  excepted, talked or sang without paying any attention to his fellows.  From wine they fell to politics, when Balmawhapple proposed a toast  which was meant to put an affront upon the uniform Edward wore, and the  King in whose army he served.    \"To the little gentleman in black velvet,\" cried the young Laird, \"he  who did such service in 1702, and may the white horse break his neck  over a mound of his making!\"    The \"little gentleman in black velvet\" was the mole over whose hillock  King William's horse is said to have stumbled, while the \"white horse\"  represented the house of Hanover.    Though of a Jacobite family, Edward could not help taking offence at the  obvious insult, but the Baron was before him. The quarrel was not his,  he assured him. The guest's quarrel was the host's--so long as he  remained under his roof.    \"Here,\" quoth the Baron, \"I am _in loco parentis_ to you, Captain  Waverley. I am bound to see you scatheless. And as for you, Mr. Falconer  of Balmawhapple, I warn you to let me see no more aberrations from the  paths of good manners.\"    \"And I tell you, Mr. Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine of Bradwardine and  Tully-Veolan,\" retorted the other, in huge disdain, \"that I will make a  muir cock of the man that refuses my toast, whether he be a crop-eared  English Whig wi' a black ribband at his lug, or ane wha deserts his  friends to claw favour wi' the rats of Hanover!\"    In an instant rapiers were out, and the Baron and Balmawhapple hard at  it. The younger man was stout and active, but he was no match for the  Baron at the sword-play. And the encounter would not have lasted long,  had not the landlady, Lucky Macleary, hearing the well-known clash of  swords, come running in on them, crying that surely the gentlemen would  not bring dishonour on an honest widow-woman's house, when there was all  the lee land in the country to do their fighting upon.    So saying, she stopped the combat very effectually by flinging her plaid  over the weapons of the adversaries.           *       *       *       *       *    Next morning Edward awoke late, and in no happy frame of mind. It was an  age of duels, and with his first waking thoughts there came the memory  of the insult which had been passed upon him by the Laird of  Balmawhapple. His position as an officer and a Waverley left him no  alternative but to send that sportsman a challenge. Upon descending, he  found Rose Bradwardine presiding at the breakfast table. She was alone,  but Edward felt in no mood for conversation, and sat gloomy, silent, and  ill-content with himself and with circumstances. Suddenly he saw the  Baron and Balmawhapple pass the window arm in arm, and the next moment  the butler summoned him to speak with his master in another apartment.    There he found Balmawhapple, no little sulky and altogether silent, with  the Baron by his side. The latter in his capacity of mediator made  Edward a full and complete apology for the events of the past  evening--an apology which the young man gladly accepted along with the  hand of the offender--somewhat stiffly given, it is true, owing to the  necessity of carrying his right arm in a sling--the result (as  Balmawhapple afterwards assured Miss Rose) of a fall from his horse.    It was not till the morning of the second day that Edward learned the  whole history of this reconciliation, which had at first been so welcome  to him. It was Daft Davie Gellatley, who, by the roguish singing of a  ballad, first roused his suspicions that something underlay  Balmawhapple's professions of regret for his conduct.            \"The young man will brawl at the evening board             _Heard ye so merry the little birds sing?_           But the old man will draw at the dawning the sword,             _And the throstle-cock's head is under his wing._\"    Edward could see by the sly looks of the Fool that he meant something  personal by this, so he plied the butler with questions, and discovered  that the Baron had actually fought Balmawhapple on the morning after the  insult, and wounded him in the sword-arm!    Here, then, was the secret of the young Laird's unexpected submission  and apology. As Davie Gellatley put it, Balmawhapple had been \"sent hame  wi' his boots full o' bluid!\"      THE FIRST INTERLUDE OF ACTION        The tale-telling had at this point to be broken      off. Clouds began to spin themselves from Eildon      top. Dinner also was in prospect, and, most of all,      having heard so much of the tale, the four      listeners desired to begin to \"play Waverley.\"        Sweetheart made a stately, if skirted,      Bradwardine. Besides, she was in _Caesar_, and      had store of Latin quotations--mostly, it is true,      from the examples in the grammar, such as \"_Illa      incedit regina!_\" Certainly she walked like a      queen. Or, as it might be expressed, more fittingly      with the character of the Baron in the original:            \"Stately stepped she east the wa',                   And stately stepped she west.\"        Hugh John considered the hero's part in any story      only his due. His only fault with that of Waverley      was that so far he had done so little. He specially      resented the terrible combat \"in the dawning\"      between the Baron and the overbold Balmawhapple      (played by Maid Margaret). Sir Toady Lion as low      comedian (\"camelion\" he called it) performed      numerous antics as Daft Davie Gellatley. He had      dressed the part to perfection by putting his      striped jersey on outside his coat, and sticking in      his cricket cap such feathers as he could find.        \"Lie down, Hugh John,\" he cried, in the middle of      his dancing and singing round and round the      combatants; \"why, you are asleep in bed!\"        This, according to the authorities, being obvious,      the baffled hero had to succumb, with the muttered      reflection that \"Jim Hawkins wouldn't have had to      stay asleep, when there was a fight like that going      on!\"        Still, however, Hugh John could not restrain the      natural rights of criticism. He continually raised      his head from his pillow of dried branches to watch      Sweetheart and Maid Margaret.        \"You fight just like girls,\" he cried indignantly;      \"keep your left hand behind you, Bradwardine--or      Balmawhapple will hack it off! I say--girls _are_      silly things. You two are afraid of hurting each      other. Now me and Toady Lion--\"        And he gave details of a late fraternal combat much      in the manner of Froissart.        It is to be noted that thus far both Sweetheart and      Maid Margaret disdained the female parts, the      latter even going the length of saying that she      preferred Celie Stubbs, the Squire's daughter at      Waverley-Honour, to Rose Bradwardine. On being      asked for an explanation of this heresy, she said,      \"Well, at any rate, Celie Stubbs got a new hat to      come to church in!\"           *       *       *       *       *        And though I read the \"Repentance and a      Reconciliation\" chapter, which makes number Twelve      of _Waverley_, to the combatants, I was conscious      that I must hasten "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#4)"],[1," were still not over-plenty,  and the strength of the owner could not be over-spent on unnecessary  fencing. Then came the double-rail fence; two rails, held in place one  above the other, at each joining, by four crossed sticks. It was a  boundary, and would keep in cattle. It was said that every fence should  be horse-high, bull-proof, and pig-tight. Then came stone walls, showing  a thorough clearing and taming of the land. The succeeding \"half-high\"  stone wall--a foot or two high, with a single rail on top--showed that  stones were not as plentiful in the fields as in early days. The  \"snake-fence,\" or \"Virginia fence,\" so common in the Southern states,  utilized the second growth of forest trees. The split-rail fence, four  or five rails in height, was set at intervals with posts, pierced with  holes to hold the ends of the rails. These were used to some extent in  the East; but our Western states were fenced throughout with rails split  by sturdy pioneer rail-splitters, among them young Abraham Lincoln.  Board fences showed the day of the sawmill and its plentiful supply; the  wire fences of to-day equally prove the decrease of our forests and our  wood, and the growth of our mineral supplies and manufactures of  metals. Thus even our fences might be called historical monuments.    A few of the old block-houses, or garrison houses, the \"defensible  houses,\" which were surrounded by these stockades, are still standing.  The most interesting are the old Garrison at East Haverhill,  Massachusetts, built in 1670; it has walls of solid oak, and brick a  foot and a half thick; the Saltonstall House at Ipswich, built in 1633;  Cradock Old Fort in Medford, Massachusetts, built in 1634 of brick made  on the spot; an old fort at York, Maine; and the Whitefield Garrison  House, built in 1639 at Guilford, Connecticut. The one at Newburyport is  the most picturesque and beautiful of them all.    As social life in Boston took on a little aspect of court life in the  circle gathered around the royal governors, the pride of the wealthy  found expression in handsome and stately houses. These were copied and  added to by men of wealth and social standing in other towns. The  Province House, built in 1679, the Frankland House in 1735, and the  Hancock House, all in Boston; the Shirley House in Roxbury, the  Wentworth Mansion in New Hampshire, are good examples. They were  dignified and simple in form, and have borne the test of  centuries,--they wear well. They never erred in over-ornamentation,  being scant of interior decoration, save in two or three principal rooms  and the hall and staircase. The panelled step ends and soffits, the  graceful newels and balusters, of those old staircases hold sway as  models to this day.    The same taste which made the staircase the centre of decoration within,  made the front door the sole point of ornamentation without; and equal  beauty is there focused. Worthy of study and reproduction, many of the  old-time front doors are with their fine panels, graceful, leaded side  windows, elaborate and pretty fan-lights, and slight but appropriate  carving. The prettiest leaded windows I ever saw in an American home  were in a thereby glorified hen-house. They had been taken from the  discarded front door of a remodelled old Falmouth house. The hens and  their owner were not of antiquarian tastes, and relinquished the windows  for a machine-made sash more suited to their plebeian tastes and  occupations. Many colonial doors had door-latches or knobs of heavy  brass; nearly all had a knocker of wrought iron or polished brass, a  cheerful ornament that ever seems to resound a welcome to the visitor as  well as a notification to the visited.    The knocker from the John Hancock House in Boston and that from the  Winslow House in Marshfield are here shown; both are now in the custody  of the Bostonian Society, and may be seen at the Old State House in  Boston. The latter was given to the society by Dr. Oliver Wendell  Holmes.    The \"King-Hooper\" House, still standing in Danvers, Massachusetts,  closely resembled the Hancock House. This house, built by Robert Hooper  in 1754, was for a time the refuge of the royal governor of  Massachusetts--Governor Gage; and hence is sometimes called General  Gage's Headquarters. When the minute-men marched past the house to  Lexington on April 18, 1775, they stripped the lead from the gate-posts.  \"King Hooper\" angrily denounced them, and a minute-man fired at him as  he entered the house. The bullet passed through the panel of the door,  and the rent may still be seen. Hence the house has been often called  The House of the Front Door with the Bullet-Hole. The present owner and  occupier of the house, Francis Peabody, Esq., has appropriately named it  The Lindens, from the stately linden trees that grace its gardens and  lawns.    In riding through those portions of our states that were the early  settled colonies, it is pleasant to note where any old houses are still  standing, or where the sites of early colonial houses are known, the  good taste usually shown by the colonists in the places chosen to build  their houses. They dearly loved a \"sightly location.\" An old writer  said: \"My consayte is such; I had rather not to builde a mansyon or a  house than to builde one without a good prospect in it, to it, and from  it.\" In Virginia the houses were set on the river slope, where every  passing boat might see them. The New England colonists painfully climbed  long, tedious hills, that they might have homes from whence could be had  a beautiful view, and this was for the double reason, as the old writer  said, that in their new homes they might both see and be seen.          CHAPTER II    THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS      The first and most natural way of lighting the houses of the American  colonists, both in the North and South, was by the pine-knots of the fat  pitch-pine, which, of course, were found everywhere in the greatest  plenty in the forests. Governor John Winthrop the younger, in his  communication to the English Royal Society in 1662, said this  candle-wood was much used for domestic illumination in Virginia, New  York, and New England. It was doubtless gathered everywhere in new  settlements, as it has been in pioneer homes till our own day. In Maine,  New Hampshire, and Vermont it was used till this century. In the  Southern states the pine-knots are still burned in humble households for  lighting purposes, and a very good light they furnish.    The historian Wood wrote in 1642, in his _New England's Prospect_:--         \"Out of these Pines is gotten the Candlewood that is much spoke of,       which may serve as a shift among poore folks, but I cannot commend       it for singular good, because it droppeth a pitchy kind of       substance where it stands.\"    That pitchy kind of substance was tar, which was one of the most  valuable trade products of the colonists. So much tar was made by  burning the pines on the banks of the Connecticut, that as early as 1650  the towns had to prohibit the using of candle-wood for tar-making if  gathered within six miles of the Connecticut River, though it could be  gathered by families for illumination and fuel.    Rev. Mr. Higginson, writing in 1633, said of these pine-knots:--         \"They are such candles as the Indians commonly use, having no       other, and they are nothing else but the wood of the pine tree,       cloven in two little slices, something thin, which are so full of       the moysture of turpentine and pitch that they burne as cleere as a       torch.\"    To avoid having smoke in the room, and on account of the pitchy  droppings, the candle-wood was usually burned in a corner of the  fireplace, on a flat stone. The knots were sometimes called  pine-torches. One old Massachusetts minister boasted at the end of his  life that every sermon of the hundreds he had written, had been copied  by the light of these torches. Rev. Mr. Newman, of Rehoboth, is said to  have compiled his vast concordance of the Bible wholly by the dancing  light of this candle-wood. Lighting was an important item of expense in  any household of so small an income as that of a Puritan minister; and  the single candle was often frugally extinguished during the long family  prayers each evening. Every family laid in a good supply of this light  wood for winter use, and it was said that a prudent New England farmer  would as soon start the winter without hay in his barn as without  candle-wood in his woodshed.    Mr. Higginson wrote in 1630: \"Though New England has no tallow to make  candles of, yet by abundance of fish thereof it can afford oil for  lamps.\" This oil was apparently wholly neglected, though there were few,  or no domestic animals to furnish tallow; but when cattle increased,  every ounce of tallow was saved as a precious and useful treasure; and  as they became plentiful it was one of the household riches of New  England, which was of value to our own day. When Governor Winthrop  arrived in Massachusetts, he promptly wrote over to his wife to bring  candles with her from England when she came. And in 1634 he sent over  for a large quantity of wicks and tallow. Candles cost fourpence apiece,  which made them costly luxuries for the thrifty colonists.    Wicks were made of loosely spun hemp or tow, or of cotton; from the  milkweed which grows so plentifully in our fields and roads to-day the  children gathered in late summer the silver \"silk-down\" which was \"spun  grossly into candle wicke.\" Sometimes the wicks were dipped into  saltpetre.    Thomas Tusser wrote in England in the sixteenth century in his  _Directions to Housewifes_:--          \"Wife, make thine own candle,        Spare penny to handle.      Provide for thy tallow ere frost cometh in,      And make thine own candle ere winter begin.\"    Every thrifty housewife in America saved her penny as in England.
