For the first Fact I'll insure thee from being hang'd; and going  to Sea, _Filch_, will come time enough upon a Sentence of  Transportation. But now, since you have nothing better to do, ev'n go to  your Book, and learn your Catechism; for really a Man makes but an ill  Figure in the Ordinary's Paper, who cannot give a satisfactory Answer to  his Questions. But, hark you, my Lad. Don't tell me a Lye; for you know  I hate a Liar. Do you know of anything that hath pass'd between Captain  _Macheath_ and our _Polly_?    _Filch._ I beg you, Madam, don't ask me; for I must either tell a Lye to  you or to Miss _Polly_; for I promis'd her I would not tell.    _Mrs. Peachum._ But when the Honour of our Family is concern'd--    _Filch._ I shall lead a sad Life with Miss _Polly_, if ever she comes to  know that I told you. Besides, I would not willingly forfeit my own  Honour by betraying any body.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Yonder comes my Husband and _Polly_. Come, _Filch_, you  shall go with me into my own Room, and tell me the whole Story. I'll  give thee a Glass of a most delicious Cordial that I keep for my own  drinking.        [Exeunt.      Enter _Peachum_, _Polly_.    _Polly._ I know as well as any of the fine Ladies how to make the most  of myself and of my Man too. A Woman knows how to be mercenary, though  she hath never been in a Court or at an Assembly. We have it in our  Natures, Papa. If I allow Captain _Macheath_ some trifling Liberties,  I have this Watch and other visible Marks of his Favour to shew for it.  A Girl who cannot grant some Things, and refuse what is most material,  will make but a poor hand of her Beauty, and soon be thrown upon the  Common.      AIR VI. What shall I do to shew how much I love her, &c.    [Music]      Virgins are like the fair Flower in its Lustre,      Which in the Garden enamels the Ground;    Near it the Bees in play flutter and cluster,      And gaudy Butterflies frolick around.    But, when once pluck'd, 'tis no longer alluring,      To _Covent-Garden_ 'tis sent (as yet sweet),    There fades, and shrinks, and grows past all enduring,      Rots, stinks, and dies, and is trod under feet.    _Peachum._ You know, _Polly_, I am not against your toying and trifling  with a Customer in the way of Business, or to get out a Secret, or so.  But if I find out that you have play'd the Fool and are married, you  Jade you, I'll cut your Throat, Hussy. Now you know my Mind.      Enter _Mrs. Peachum_, in a very great Passion.      AIR VII. Oh _London_ is a fine Town.    [Music]      Our _Polly_ is a sad Slut!        nor heeds what we have taught her.    I wonder any Man alive        will ever rear a Daughter!    For she must have both Hoods and Gowns,        and Hoops to swell her Pride,    With Scarfs and Stays, and Gloves and Lace;        and she will have Men beside;    And when she's drest with Care and Cost,        all tempting, fine and gay,    As Men should serve a Cucumber,        she flings herself away.    Our _Polly_ is a sad Slut! &c.    You Baggage! you Hussy! you inconsiderate Jade! had you been hang'd, it  would not have vex'd me, for that might have been your Misfortune; but  to do such a mad thing by Choice; The Wench is married, Husband.    _Peachum._ Married! the Captain is a bold Man, and will risk any thing  for Money; to be sure he believes her a Fortune. Do you think your  Mother and I should have liv'd comfortably so long together, if ever we  had been married? Baggage!    _Mrs. Peachum._ I knew she was always a proud Slut; and now the Wench  hath play'd the Fool and Married, because forsooth she would do like the  Gentry. Can you support the Expence of a Husband, Hussy, in Gaming,  Drinking and Whoring? Have you Money enough to carry on the daily  Quarrels of Man and Wife about who shall squander most? There are not  many Husbands and Wives, who can bear the Charges of plaguing one  another in a handsom way. If you must be married, could you introduce no  body into our Family but a Highwayman? Why, thou foolish Jade, thou wilt  be as ill-us'd, and as much neglected, as if thou hadst married a Lord!    _Peachum._ Let not your Anger, my Dear, break through the Rules of  Decency, for the Captain looks upon himself in the Military Capacity, as  a Gentleman by his Profession. Besides what he hath already, I know he  is in a fair way of getting, or of dying; and both these ways, let me  tell you, are most excellent Chances for a Wife. Tell me, Hussy, are you  ruin'd or no?    _Mrs. Peachum._ With _Polly's_ Fortune, she might very well have gone  off to a Person of Distinction. Yes, that you might, you pouting Slut!    _Peachum._ What is the Wench dumb? Speak, or I'll make you plead by  squeezing out an Answer from you. Are you really bound Wife to him, or  are you only upon liking?    [Pinches her.    _Polly._ Oh!    [Screaming.    _Mrs. Peachum._ How the Mother is to be pitied who hath handsom  Daughters! Locks, Bolts, Bars, and Lectures of Morality are nothing to  them: They break through them all. They have as much Pleasure in  cheating a Father and Mother, as in cheating at Cards.    _Peachum._ Why, _Polly_, I shall soon know if you are married, by  _Macheath's_ keeping from our House.      AIR VIII. Grim King of the Ghosts, &c.    [Music]      _Polly._ Can Love be control'd by Advice?      Will _Cupid_ our Mothers obey?    Though my Heart were as frozen as Ice,      At his Flame 'twould have melted away.    When he kist me so closely he prest,      'Twas so sweet that I must have comply'd:    So I thought it both safest and best      To marry, for fear you should chide.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Then all the Hopes of our Family are gone for ever and  ever!    _Peachum._ And _Macheath_ may hang his Father and Mother-in-law, in hope  to get into their Daughter's Fortune.    _Polly._ I did not marry him (as 'tis the Fashion) coolly and  deliberately for Honour or Money. But, I love him.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Love him! worse and worse! I thought the Girl had been  better bred. Oh Husband, Husband! her Folly makes me mad! my Head swims!  I'm distracted! I can't support myself-- Oh!    [Faints.    _Peachum._ See, Wench, to what a Condition you have reduc'd your poor  Mother! a Glass of Cordial, this instant. How the poor Woman takes it to  heart!      [_Polly_ goes out, and returns with it.    Ah, Hussy, now this is the only Comfort your Mother has left!    _Polly._ Give her another Glass, Sir! my Mama drinks double the Quantity  whenever she is out of Order. This, you see, fetches her.    _Mrs. Peachum._ The Girl shews such a Readiness, and so much Concern,  that I could almost find in my Heart to forgive her.      AIR IX. O _Jenny_, O _Jenny_, where hast thou been.    [Music]      O _Polly_, you might have toy'd and kist.    By keeping Men off, you keep them on.      _Polly._ But he so teaz'd me,        And he so pleas'd me,    What I did, you must have done.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Not with a Highwayman. --You sorry Slut!    _Peachum._ A Word with you, Wife. 'Tis no new thing for a Wench to take  Man without Consent of Parents. You know 'tis the Frailty of Women, my  Dear.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Yes, indeed, the Sex is frail. But the first time a  Woman is frail, she should be somewhat nice methinks, for then or never  is the time to make her Fortune. After that, she hath nothing to do but  to guard herself from being found out, and she may do what she pleases.    _Peachum._ Make yourself a little easy; I have a Thought shall soon set  all Matters again to rights. Why so melancholy, _Polly_? since what is  done cannot be undone, we must all endeavour to make the best of it.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Well, _Polly_; as far as one Woman can forgive another,  I forgive thee. --Your Father is too fond of you, Hussy.    _Polly._ Then all my Sorrows are at an end.    _Mrs. Peachum._ A mighty likely Speech in troth, for a Wench who is just  married!      AIR X. _Thomas_, I cannot, &c.    [Music]      _Polly._ I, like a Ship in Storms, was tost;    Yet afraid to put in to Land:    For seiz'd in the Port the Vessel's lost,    Whose Treasure is contreband.      The Waves are laid,      My Duty's paid.    O Joy beyond Expression!      Thus, safe a-shore,      I ask no more,    My All is in my Possession.    _Peachum._ I hear Customers in t'other Room: Go, talk with 'em, _Polly_;  but come to us again, as soon as they are gone. --But, hark ye, Child,  if 'tis the Gentleman who was here Yesterday about the Repeating Watch;  say, you believe we can't get Intelligence of it 'till to-morrow. For I  lent it to _Suky Straddle_, to make a figure with it to-night at a  Tavern in _Drury-Lane_. If t'other Gentleman calls for the Silver-hilted  Sword; you know _Beetle-brow'd Jemmy_ hath it on, and he doth not come  from _Tunbridge_ 'till _Tuesday_ Night; so that it cannot be had 'till  then.        [Exit _Polly_.    _Peachum._ Dear Wife, be a little pacified, Don't let your Passion run  away with your Senses. _Polly_, I grant you, hath done a rash thing.    _Mrs. Peachum._ If she had only an Intrigue with the Fellow, why the  very best Families have excus'd and huddled up a Frailty of that sort.  'Tis Marriage, Husband, that makes it a Blemish.    _Peachum._ But Money, Wife, is the true Fuller's Earth for Reputations,  there is not a Spot or a Stain but what it can take out. A rich Rogue  now-a-days is fit Company for any Gentleman; and the World, my Dear,  hath not such a Contempt for Roguery as you imagine. I tell you, Wife,  I can make this Match turn to our Advantage.    _Mrs. Peachum._ I am very sensible, Husband, that Captain _Macheath_ is  worth Money, but I am in doubt whether he hath not two or three Wives  already, and then if he should die in a Session or two, _Polly's_ Dower  would come into Dispute.    _Peachum._ That, indeed, is a Point which ought to be consider'd.

As he walked, his eyes upon the ground, he  spied a bird's nest hidden in the grass, and arrested his feet just in  time to prevent stepping on it. He paused to look at the little nest  tucked away so snug and warm, and noted that it held six eggs, and  that a peeping sound came from some of them. While he watched, one  moved; and soon a tiny bill pushed through the shell, uttering a  shrill cry. At once the parent birds answered, and he looked up to see  where they were. They were not far off, and were flying about in  search of food, chirping the while to each other and now calling to  the little one in the nest.    \"The homely scene stirred the heart and the thoughts of the man, as he  stood there under the clear sky, glancing upward toward the old birds  and then down at the helpless young in the nest at his feet. As he  looked, he thought of his people, who were so often careless and  thoughtless of their children's needs; and his mind brooded over the  matter. After many days he desired to see the nest again. So he went  to the place where he had found it; and there it was, as safe as when  he left it. But a change had taken place. It was now full to  overflowing with little birds, who were stretching their wings,  balancing on their small legs, and making ready to fly; while the  parents with encouraging calls were coaxing the fledglings to venture  forth.    \"'Ah!' said the man, 'if my people would only learn of the birds,  and, like them, care for their young and provide for their future,  homes would be full and happy, and our tribe be strong and prosperous.    \"When this man became a priest, he told the story of the bird's nest  and sang its song; and so it has come down to us from the days of our  fathers.\"    [Music: SONG OF THE BIRD'S NEST.    _Pawnee._    Transcribed from Graphophone and harmonized by EDWIN S. TRACY.    Ho-o  Ha-re ha-re re ha-re  Ha-re ha-re e ha-re  Re wha-ka ha-re re ha-re, wha-ka ha-re re ha-re  Re wha-ka ha-re re ha-re.]          A TRYSTING LOVE-SONG.      One of the few delights of life in camp is the opportunity the tent  affords of ready access to the open air. There is no traversing of  stairways, no crossing of halls, and no opening of reluctant doors,  but only the parting of the canvas, and our world is as wide as the  horizon and high as the heavens. Even when the tent door-flap is  snugly closed, nature is not wholly shut out. Often I have lain  looking up at the stars as they passed slowly across the central  opening, and listened to the flight of the birds as they travelled  northward at the coming of spring. And I have watched the birth of  many a day, from the first quivering primrose hue to the full flush  and glow of rosy colour, and then the stirring breeze, the waking  leaves, and the call of the birds breaking into song.    One morning I rose from my blankets and stepped out under the broad  dome of the sky, while all about me in their shadowy tents the people  slept. I wandered toward a glen, down which the water from a little  spring hurried to the brook. As I sat among the fresh undergrowth, I  watched the stars grow dim and the thin line of smoke rise from the  tents, telling that the mother had risen to blow the embers to a  blaze and to put another stick or two upon the fire.    As I sat, thinking a multitude of thoughts, I heard a rustling upon  the hill opposite me. Then there was silence, quickly broken by  movements in another direction; while from the hill came the clear  voice of a young man singing. In a moment more two women, whom I  recognised as aunt and niece, appeared at the spring, the one elderly,  the other young and pretty; but the singer was still invisible. The  cadences of the song were blithe and glad, like the birds and the  breezes laden with summer fragrance. The words, \"I see them coming!\"  carried a double meaning. The girl for whom he had waited was in truth  coming, but to the singer was also coming the delight of growing love  and abundant hope.    [Music: TRYSTING LOVE SONG.    _Omaha._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.    Hi dha ho!  Sha a-ma wi un-don-be a-me dho he,  Sha a-ma wi un-don-be a-me dho he  Sha a-ma wi un-don-be a-me dho he dhoe.  Hi dha ho!  Sha a-ma wi un-don-be a-me dho he.  Sha a-ma wi un-don-be a-me dho he.]    The women filled their water vessels. The elder took no note of the  song, but turned steadily toward the home path. The eyes of the maiden  had been slyly searching the hillside as she slowly neared the spring  and dipped up the sparkling water. Now, as the aunt walked away, the  song ceased; and a light rustling followed, as the lover, bounding  down the hill, leaped the brook and was at the side of the girl. A  few hasty words, a call from the aunt, a lingering parting, and I was  alone again. The brook went babbling on, but telling no tales, the  birds were busy with their own affairs, and the sunbeams winked  brightly through the leaves. The little rift, giving a glimpse of the  inner life of two souls, had closed and left no outward sign; and yet  the difference!    There was a measured thud upon the trail, and an old woman with  stooping shoulders passed down the glen. As she bent over the spring  and took her water supply, I heard the young man's voice in the  distance, singing his song as he wended his way home. The old woman  heard it, too. She straightened up and looked steadily in the  direction of the singer, slowly shook her head, picked up her water  vessel, and turned away, her crooked figure disappearing in the  shadows. Then I arose and followed the singer, trying to forget the  warning shake of the old woman's head.          STORY AND SONG OF THE DEATHLESS VOICE.[4]    [Footnote 4: The translation of the story is by Mr. Francis La  Flesche.]    ORIGIN OF THE MA-WA'-DA-NI SOCIETY.      A long, long time ago a large number of warriors, under the leadership  of a man noted throughout the warlike tribes for his valorous deeds,  started forth to harass and, if possible, to drive a powerful people  from a territory which abounded in game. This war party was out many  days, had many a weary march in search of the enemy, scouring the  country far and wide, keeping their scouts in the front, rear, and  flank; for the leader was determined not to return to his village  without the trophies of war.    They came one day to a large grove with a clear brook running through  it. Here the Leader ordered the camp to be pitched, that his little  army might rest awhile and repair their moccasins and clothing.  Sentinels were stationed so as to guard against surprise. Hunters were  sent forth, and returned laden with game.    Night came on. There was no moon; and it was dark, although the stars  shone brightly. A fire blazed in the open air, and the men whose duty  it was to dress and cook the meat, were moving about the burning logs;  while others sat mending their moccasins by the firelight, listening  to stories of battles, marvellous escapes, and strange adventures.    Supper was cooked, and the meat was piled on freshly cut grass spread  upon the ground; and near by were set the pots of broth and the wooden  bowls and horn spoons. The Leader was called to perform the usual  sacred rites observed before the serving of food; and all the warriors  gathered around the fire, each one eager for his portion of the meal.  At a signal from the Leader every man bowed his head, and there was  silence. Not a breath of air was stirring. Now and then could be heard  the far-off dismal howl of the grey wolf or the cry of a strange bird  startled from its nest by a coyote. Save from these and the crackling  of the fire there was stillness in all the surroundings. The warriors  had made their silent petitions to Wako_n_'-da, the power that moves  all things. The Leader lifted his head. Then from the pile of meat he  took a bit and raised it toward the sky, as an offering to that  mysterious power, when suddenly the stillness was broken and the  ceremony interrupted by a clear voice bursting into song, the echoes  in the hills and valleys catching and repeating the strain.    Each warrior involuntarily grasped his bow. The Leader, ever keen and  alert, exclaimed in a hoarse whisper, \"The fire! the fire!\"  Immediately many hands were rubbing the flaming wood into the earth.  Commands were hastily given by the Leader; and the warriors, with  palpitating hearts, started out to form a ring around the spot whence  the thrilling sounds came. The voice sang on. The ring grew smaller  and smaller until in an open space the shadowy form of a tree loomed  up before the advancing warriors. No escape was now possible for the  singer, yet the song went on without hesitancy. The tree was now  clearly visible. The song came to a close, and the echo died away in  the distance. The men kept on toward the tree, with bows drawn and  arrows strung. No form was seen running around inside the ring,  seeking an opening for escape; but, lo! at the foot of the tree lay  scattered the whitened bones and the grinning skull of a man. Death  had claimed the body of this warrior and compelled its return to dust,  but had failed to silence the voice of the man who, when living, had  often defied death.
