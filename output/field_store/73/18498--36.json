Exclusively of       his fine statues, and architectural decorations, the Earl       contrived to procure a number of curious and rare books; and       the testimonies of Maittaire [who speaks indeed of him with       a sort of rapture!] and Palmer shew that the productions of       Jenson and Caxton were no strangers to his library. _Annales       Typographici_, vol.

In spite of Gibbon's unmerciful critique       [_Posthumous Works_, vol. II. 711.], the productions of this       modest, erudite, and indefatigable antiquary are rising in       price proportionably to their worth. If he had only edited       the _Collectanea_ and _Itinerary_ of his favourite Leland,       he would have stood on high ground in the department of       literature and antiquities; but his other and numerous works       place him on a much loftier eminence. Of these, the present       is not the place to make mention; suffice it to say that,       for copies of his works, on LARGE PAPER, which the author       used to advertise as selling for 7_s._ or 10_s._, or about       which placards, to the same effect, used to be stuck on the       walls of the colleges,--these very copies are now sometimes       sold for more than the like number of guineas! It is amusing       to observe that the lapse of a few years only has caused       such a rise in the article of HEARNE; and that the Peter       Langtoft on large paper, which at Rowe Mores's sale [Bibl.       Mores. No. 2191.] was purchased for L1. 2_s._ produced at       a late sale, [A.D. 1808] L37! A complete list of Hearne's       Pieces will be found at the end of his Life, printed with       Leland's, &c., at the Clarendon Press, in 1772, 8vo. Of       these the \"_Acta Apostolorum_, Gr. Lat;\" and \"_Aluredi       Beverlacensis Annales_,\" are, I believe, the scarcest. It is       wonderful to think how this amiable and excellent man       persevered \"through evil report and good report,\" in       illustrating the antiquities of his country. To the very       last he appears to have been molested; and among his       persecutors, the learned editor of Josephus and Dionysius       Halicarnasseus, Dr. Hudson, must be ranked, to the disgrace       of himself and the party which he espoused. \"Hearne was       buried in the church yard of St. Peter's (at Oxford) in the       East, where is erected over his remains, a tomb, with an       inscription written by himself,              Amicitiae Ergo.

In either case a  rupture would not be attended by an explosion, as water is very  inelastic.    The days when an engineer could \"sit on the valves\"--that is, screw them  down--to obtain greater pressure, are now past, and with them a  considerable proportion of the dangers of high-pressure steam. The  Factory Act of 1895, in force throughout the British Isles, provides  that every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop where  the Act applies must have a proper safety-valve, steam-gauge, and  water-gauge; and that boilers and fittings must be examined by a  competent person at least once in every fourteen months. Neglect of  these provisions renders the owner of a boiler liable to heavy penalties  if an explosion occurs.    One of the most disastrous explosions on record took place at the Redcar  Iron Works, Yorkshire, in June 1895. In this case, twelve out of fifteen  boilers ranged side by side burst, through one proving too weak for its  work. The flying fragments of this boiler, striking the sides of other  boilers, exploded them, and so the damage was transmitted down the line.  Twenty men were killed and injured; while masses of metal, weighing  several tons each, were hurled 250 yards, and caused widespread damage.    The following is taken from a journal, dated December 22, 1895:  \"_Providence_ (_Rhode Island_).--A recent prophecy that a boiler would  explode between December 16 and 24 in a store has seriously affected the  Christmas trade. Shoppers are incredibly nervous. One store advertises,  'No boilers are being used; lifts running electrically.' All stores have  had their boilers inspected.\"      THE WATER-GAUGE.    No fitting of a boiler is more important than the _water-gauge_, which  shows the level at which the water stands. The engineer must continually  consult his gauge, for if the water gets too low, pipes and other  surfaces exposed to the furnace flames may burn through, with disastrous  results; while, on the other hand, too much water will cause bad  steaming. A section of an ordinary gauge is seen in Fig. 12. It consists  of two parts, each furnished with a gland, G, to make a steam-tight  joint round the glass tube, which is inserted through the hole covered  by the plug P^1. The cocks T^1 T^2 are normally open, allowing the  ingress of steam and water respectively to the tube. Cock T^3 is kept  closed unless for any reason it is necessary to blow steam or water  through the gauge. The holes C C can be cleaned out if the plugs P^2  P^3 are removed.    Most gauges on high-pressure boilers have a thick glass screen in front,  so that in the event of the tube breaking, the steam and water may not  blow directly on to the attendants. A further precaution is to include  two ball-valves near the ends of the gauge-glass. Under ordinary  conditions the balls lie in depressions clear of the ways; but when a  rush of steam or water occurs they are sucked into their seatings and  block all egress.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Section of a water-gauge.]    On many boilers two water-gauges are fitted, since any gauge may work  badly at times. The glasses are tested to a pressure of 3,000 lbs. or  more to the square inch before use.      THE STEAM-GAUGE.    It is of the utmost importance that a person in charge of a boiler  should know what pressure the steam has reached. Every boiler is  therefore fitted with one _steam-gauge_; many with two, lest one might  be unreliable. There are two principal types of steam-gauge:--(1) The  Bourdon; (2) the Schaeffer-Budenberg. The principle of the Bourdon is  illustrated by Fig. 13, in which A is a piece of rubber tubing closed at  one end, and at the other drawn over the nozzle of a cycle tyre  inflator. If bent in a curve, as shown, the section of the tube is an  oval. When air is pumped in, the rubber walls endeavour to assume a  circular section, because this shape encloses a larger area than an oval  of equal circumference, and therefore makes room for a larger volume of  air. In doing so the tube straightens itself, and assumes the position  indicated by the dotted lines. Hang an empty \"inner tube\" of a pneumatic  tyre over a nail and inflate it, and you will get a good illustration of  the principle.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Showing the principle of the steam-gauge.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Bourdon steam-gauge. Part of dial removed to  show mechanism.]    In Fig. 14 we have a Bourdon gauge, with part of the dial face broken  away to show the internal mechanism. T is a flattened metal tube  soldered at one end into a hollow casting, into which screws a tap  connected with the boiler. The other end (closed) is attached to a link,  L, which works an arm of a quadrant rack, R, engaging with a small  pinion, P, actuating the pointer. As the steam pressure rises, the tube  T moves its free end outwards towards the position shown by the dotted  lines, and traverses the arm of the rack, so shifting the pointer round  the scale. As the pressure falls, the tube gradually returns to its zero  position.    The Schaeffer-Budenberg gauge depends for its action on the elasticity of  a thin corrugated metal plate, on one side of which steam presses. As  the plate bulges upwards it pushes up a small rod resting on it, which  operates a quadrant and rack similar to that of the Bourdon gauge. The  principle is employed in another form for the aneroid barometer (p.  329).      THE WATER SUPPLY TO A BOILER.    The water inside a boiler is kept at a proper level by (1) pumps or (2)  injectors. The former are most commonly used on stationary and marine  boilers. As their mechanism is much the same as that of ordinary force  pumps, which will be described in a later chapter, we may pass at once  to the _injector_, now almost universally used on locomotive, and  sometimes on stationary boilers. At first sight the injector is a  mechanical paradox, since it employs the steam from a boiler to blow  water into the boiler. In Fig. 15 we have an illustration of the  principle of an injector. Steam is led from the boiler through pipe A,  which terminates in a nozzle surrounded by a cone, E, connected by the  pipe B with the water tank. When steam is turned on it rushes with  immense velocity from the nozzle, and creates a partial vacuum in cone  E, which soon fills with water. On meeting the water the steam  condenses, but not before it has imparted some of its _velocity_ to the  water, which thus gains sufficient momentum to force down the valve and  find its way to the boiler. The overflow space O O between E and C  allows steam and water to escape until the water has gathered the  requisite momentum.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Diagram illustrating the principle of a  steam-injector.]    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--The Giffard injector.]    A form of injector very commonly used is Giffard's (Fig. 16). Steam is  allowed to enter by screwing up the valve V. As it rushes through the  nozzle of the cone A it takes up water and projects it into the \"mixing  cone\" B, which can be raised or lowered by the pinion D (worked by the  hand-wheel wheel shown) so as to regulate the amount of water admitted  to B. At the centre of B is an aperture, O, communicating with the  overflow. The water passes to the boiler through the valve on the left.  It will be noticed that the cone A and the part of B above the orifice O  contract downward. This is to convert the _pressure_ of the steam into  _velocity_. Below O is a cone, the diameter of which increases  downwards. Here the _velocity_ of the water is converted back into  _pressure_ in obedience to a well-known hydromechanic law.    An injector does not work well if the feed-water be too hot to condense  the steam quickly; and it may be taken as a rule that the warmer the  water, the smaller is the amount of it injected by a given weight of  steam.[2] Some injectors have flap-valves covering the overflow orifice,  to prevent air being sucked in and carried to the boiler.    When an injector receives a sudden shock, such as that produced by the  passing of a locomotive over points, it is liable to \"fly off\"--that is,  stop momentarily--and then send the steam and water through the  overflow. If this happens, both steam and water must be turned off, and  the injector be restarted; unless it be of the _self-starting_ variety,  which automatically controls the admission of water to the  \"mixing-cone,\" and allows the injector to \"pick up\" of itself.    For economy's sake part of the steam expelled from the cylinders of a  locomotive is sometimes used to work an injector, which passes the water  on, at a pressure of 70 lbs. to the square inch, to a second injector  operated by high-pressure steam coming direct from the boiler, which  increases its velocity sufficiently to overcome the boiler pressure. In  this case only a fraction of the weight of high-pressure steam is  required to inject a given weight of water, as compared with that used  in a single-stage injector.      [1] \"The Steam-Engine,\" p. 3.    [2] By \"weight of steam\" is meant the steam produced by boiling a  certain weight of water. A pound of steam, if condensed, would form a  pound of water.
