The best water-proof footwear is the  Esquimau mukluk, not easily obtainable in the interior of Alaska, but  the mukluk is an inconvenient footwear to put snow-shoes on. Rubber  boots or shoes of any kind are most uncomfortable things to travel in.  Nothing equals the moccasin on the trail, nothing is so good to  snow-shoe in. The well-equipped traveller has moccasins for dry trails  and mukluks for wet trails--and even then may sometimes get his feet  wet. Nor are his own feet his only consideration; his dogs' feet are,  collectively, as important as his own. When the dog comes out of water  into snow again the snow collects and freezes between the toes, and if  not removed will soon cause a sore and lameness. Then a dog moccasin  must be put on and the foot continually nursed and doctored. When  several dogs of a team are thus affected, it may be with several feet  each, the labour and trouble of travel are greatly increased.    So, whenever his dogs have been through water, the careful musher will  stop and go all down the line, cleaning out the ice and snow from their  feet with his fingers. Four interdigital spaces per foot make sixteen  per dog, and with a team of six dogs that means ninety-six several  operations with the bare hand (if it be done effectually) every time the  team gets into an overflow. The dogs will do it for themselves if they  are given time, tearing out the lumps of ice with their teeth; but,  inasmuch as they usually feel conscientiously obliged to eat each lump  as they pull it out, it takes much longer, and in a short daylight there  is little time to spare if the day's march is to be made.    [Sidenote: \"OVERFLOW\" ICE]    We found overflow almost as soon as we reached the Chatanika River, and  in one form or another we encountered it during all the two days and a  half that we were pursuing the river's windings. At times it was covered  with a sheet of new ice that would support the dogs but would not  support the sled, so that the dogs were travelling on one level and the  sled on another, and a man had to walk along in the water between the  dogs and the sled for several hundred yards at a time, breaking down the  overflow ice with his feet.    At other times the thin sheets of overflow ice would sway and bend as  the sled passed quickly over them in a way that gives to ice in such  condition its Alaskan name of \"rubber-ice,\" while for the fifteen or  twenty miles of McManus Creek, the headwaters of the Chatanika, we had  continuous stretches of fine glare ice with enough frost crystals upon  it from condensing moisture to give a \"tooth\" to the dogs' feet, just as  varnish on a photographic negative gives tooth to the retouching pencil.  Perfectly smooth ice is a very difficult surface for dogs to pass over;  glare ice slightly roughened by frost deposit makes splendid, fast  going.    Eighty-five miles or so from Fairbanks, and just about half-way to  Circle, the watercourse is left and the first summit is the  \"Twelve-Mile,\" as it is called. We tried hard to take our load up at one  trip, but found it impossible to do so, and had to unlash the sled and  take half the load at a time, caching it on the top while we returned  for the other half.    It took us half a day to get our load to the top of the Twelve-Mile  summit, a rise of about one thousand three hundred feet from the creek  bed as the aneroid gave it. In the steeper pitches we had to take the  axe and cut steps, so hard and smooth does the incessant wind at these  heights beat the snow, and on our second trip to the top we were just in  time to rescue a roll of bedding that had been blown from the cache and  was about to descend a gully from which we could hardly have recovered  it.    This summit descended, we were in Birch Creek water, and had we followed  the watercourse would have reached the Yukon; but we would have  travelled hundreds of miles and would have come out below Fort Yukon,  while we were bound for Circle City. So there was another and a yet more  difficult summit to cross before we could descend the Yukon slope. We  were able to hire a man and two dogs to help us over the Eagle summit,  so that the necessity of relaying was avoided. One man ahead continually  calling to the dogs, eight dogs steadily pulling, and two men behind  steadily pushing, foot by foot, with many stoppages as one bench after  another was surmounted, we got the load to the top at last, a rise of  one thousand four hundred feet in less than three miles. A driving  snow-storm cut off all view and would have left us at a loss which way  to proceed but for the stakes that indicated it.    The descent was as anxious and hazardous as the ascent had been  laborious. The dogs were loosed and sent racing down the slope. With a  rope rough-lock around the sled runners, one man took the gee pole and  another the handle-bars and each spread-eagled himself through the loose  deep snow to check the momentum of the sled, until sled and men turned  aside and came to a stop in a drift to avoid a steep, smooth pitch. The  sled extricated, it was poised on the edge of the pitch and turned loose  on the hardened snow, hurtling down three or four hundred feet until it  buried itself in another drift. The dogs were necessary to drag it from  this drift, and one had to go down and bring them up. Then again they  were loosed, and from bench to bench the process was repeated until the  slope grew gentle enough to permit the regulation of the downward  progress by the foot-brake.    [Sidenote: \"SUMMITS\"]    The Eagle summit is one of the most difficult summits in Alaska. The  wind blows so fiercely that sometimes for days together its passage is  almost impossible. No amount of trail making could be of much help, for  the snow smothers up everything on the lee of the hill, and the end of  every storm presents a new surface and an altered route. A \"summit\" in  this Alaskan sense is, of course, a saddle between peaks, and in this  case there is no easier pass and no way around. The only way to avoid  the Eagle summit, without going out of the district altogether, would be  to tunnel it.    The summit passed, we found better trails and a more frequented country,  for in this district are a number of creeks that draw supplies from  Circle City, and that had been worked ten years or more.    At the time of the Klondike stampede of 1896-97, Circle City was already  established as a flourishing mining camp and boasted itself the largest  log-cabin town in the world. Before the Klondike drew away its people as  a stronger magnet draws iron filings from a lesser one, Circle had a  population of about three thousand. Take a town of three thousand and  reduce it to thirty or forty, and it is hard to resist the melancholy  impression which entrance upon it in the dusk of the evening brings.  There lay the great white Yukon in the middle distance; beyond it the  Yukon Flats, snow-covered, desolate, stretched away enormously, hedged  here at their beginning by grey, dim hills. Spread out in the foreground  were the little, squat, huddling cabins that belonged to no one, with  never a light in a window or smoke from a chimney, the untrodden snow  drifted against door and porch. It would be hard to imagine a drearier  prospect, and one had the feeling that it was a city of the dead rather  than merely a dead city.    The weather had grown steadily colder since we reached the Yukon slope,  and for two days before reaching Circle the thermometer had stood  between 40 deg. and 50 deg. below zero. It was all right for us to push on, the  trail was good and nearly all down-hill, and there were road-houses  every ten or twelve miles. Freighters, weather-bound, came to the doors  as we passed by with our jangle of bells and would raise a somewhat  chechaco pride in our breasts by remarking: \"You don't seem to care what  weather you travel in!\" The evil of it was that the perfectly safe  travelling between Eagle Creek and Circle emboldened us to push on from  Circle under totally different conditions, when travelling at such low  temperatures became highly dangerous and brought us into grave  misadventure that might easily have been fatal catastrophe.    Our original start was a week later than had been planned and we had  made no time, but rather lost it, on this first division of the journey.  If we were to reach Bettles on the Koyukuk River for Christmas, there  was no more time to lose, and I was anxious to spend the next Sunday at  Fort Yukon, three days' journey away. So we started for Fort Yukon on  Thursday, the 7th of December, the day after we reached Circle.    [Sidenote: THE YUKON FLATS]    A certain arctic traveller has said that \"adventures\" always imply  either incompetence or ignorance of local conditions, and there is some  truth in the saying. Our misadventure was the result of a series of  mistakes, no one of which would have been other than discreditable to  men of more experience. Our course lay for seventy-five miles through  the Yukon Flats, which begin at Circle and extend for two hundred and  fifty miles of the river's course below that point. The Flats constitute  the most difficult and dangerous part of the whole length of the Yukon  River, summer or winter, and the section between Circle City and Fort  Yukon is the most difficult and dangerous part of the Flats. Save for a  \"portage\" or land trail of eighteen or twenty miles out of Circle, the  trail is on the river itself, which is split up into many channels  without salient landmarks. The current is so swift that many stretches  run open water far into the winter, and blow-holes are numerous. There  is little travel on the Flats in winter, and a snow-storm accompanied by  wind may obliterate what trail there is in an hour. The vehicle used in  the Flats is not a sled but a toboggan, and our first mistake was in not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22976"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#4)"],[1,"' In a  day or two everybody on the plantation seemed to be disturbed and  marster and missus were crying. Marster ordered all the slaves to come  to the great house at nine o'clock. Nobody was working and slaves were  walking over the grove in every direction. At nine o'clock all the  slaves gathered at the great house and marster and missus came out on  the porch and stood side by side. You could hear a pin drap everything  was so quiet. Then marster said, 'Good morning,' and missus said, 'Good  morning, children'. They were both crying. Then marster said, 'Men,  women and children, you are free. You are no longer my slaves. The  Yankees will soon be here.'    Marster and missus then went into the house got two large arm chairs  put them on the porch facing the avenue and sat down side by side and  remained there watching.    In about an hour there was one of the blackest clouds coming up the  avenue from the main road. It was the Yankee soldiers, they finally  filled the mile long avenue reaching from marster's house to the main  Louisburg road and spread out over the mile square grove. The mounted  men dismounted. The footmen stacked their shining guns and began to  build fires and cook. They called the slaves, saying, 'Your are free.'  Slaves were whooping and laughing and acting like they were crazy.  Yankee soldiers were shaking hands with the Negroes and calling them  Sam, Dinah, Sarah and asking them questions. They busted the door to the  smoke house and got all the hams. They went to the ice-house and got  several barrels of brandy, and such a time. The Negroes and Yankees were  cooking and eating together. The Yankees told them to come on and join  them, they were free. Marster and missus sat on the porch and they were  so humble no Yankee bothered anything in the great house. The slaves  were awfully excited. The Yankees stayed there, cooked, eat, drank and  played music until about night, then a bugle began to blow and you never  saw such getting on horses and lining up in your life. In a few minutes  they began to march, leaving the grove which was soon as silent as a  grave yard. They took marster's horses and cattle with them and joined  the main army and camped just across Cypress Creek one and one half  miles from my marster's place on the Louisburg Road.    When they left the country, lot of the slaves went with them and soon  there were none of marster's slaves left. They wandered around for a  year from place to place, fed and working most of the time at some  other slave owner's plantation and getting more homesick every day.    The second year after the surrender our marster and missus got on their  carriage and went and looked up all the Negroes they heard of who ever  belonged to them. Some who went off with the Yankees were never heard of  again. When marster and missus found any of theirs they would say,  'Well, come on back home.' My father and mother, two uncles and their  families moved back. Also Lorenza Brodie, and John Brodie and their  families moved back. Several of the young men and women who once  belonged to him came back. Some were so glad to get back they cried,  'cause fare had been mighty bad part of the time they were rambling  around and they were hungry. When they got back marster would say, 'Well  you have come back home have you, and the Negroes would say, 'Yes  marster.' Most all spoke of them as missus and marster as they did  before the surrender, and getting back home was the greatest pleasure of  all.    We stayed with marster and missus and went to their church, the Maple  Springs Baptist church, until they died.    Since the surrender I married James Anderson. I had four children, one  boy and three girls.    I think slavery was a mighty good thing for mother, father, me and the  other members of the family, and I cannot say anything but good for my  old marster and missus, but I can only speak for those whose conditions  I have known during slavery and since. For myself and them, I will say  again, slavery was a mighty good thing.          N. C. District: No. 2                    [320280]  Worker:         Mary A.

She seemed ashamed, but the daughter took the shirt off, exposing the  back and shoulders which were marked as though branded with a plaited  cowhide whip.

I was eighteen years old in 1875 but I wanted to get married so I gave  my age as nineteen. I wish I could recall some of the ole days when I  was with my missus in Orange County, playing with my brothers and other  slave children.    I was owned by Mr. Franklin Davis and my madam was Mrs. Bettie Davis. I  and my brother used to scratch her feet and rub them for her; you know  how old folks like to have their feet rubbed. My brother and I used to  scrap over who should scratch and rub her feet. She would laugh and tell  us not to do that way that she loved us both. Sometimes she let me sleep  at her feet at night. She was plenty good to all of the slaves. Her  daughter Sallie taught me my A B C's in Webster's Blue Back spelling  Book. When I learned to Spell B-a-k-e-r, Baker, I thought that was  something. The next word I felt proud to spell was s-h-a-d-y, shady, the  next l-a-d-y, lady. I would spell them out loud as I picked up chips in  the yard to build a fire with.
