His own  landlord, the Duke of Somerset, was of this way of thinking, and after  some remonstrances at second-hand which proved unavailing, his Grace  resolved that this \"pestilent Scotchman\" must be got rid of. A bill in  Chancery was filed against him on some pretext or other, with the view  of putting an end to his tenancy. Years of irritating and ruinous  litigation followed, the ultimate result of which was a decision in Mr.  Gourlay's favour. But it was the old story of _Jarndyce_ v. _Jarndyce_.  The protracted litigation had eaten up the substance of the successful  litigant, and upon the promulgation of the decree the Wiltshire Radical  was a ruined man. This would have been a matter of secondary importance  to the heir of a wealthy Fifeshire laird, but unhappily his father had  also come to the end of his resources. Injudicious speculation and the  mismanagement of an agent, combined with the necessity of placing a  large quantity of real estate in the market at an inauspicious time,  were the causes which led to the bankruptcy of the elder Gourlay, who  was stripped of his great possessions and left with a bare subsistence.  The son's prospects of inheriting a fortune were thus at an end, and at  thirty-seven years of age he found himself almost wholly without means,  and with a family of five children and a wife in delicate health  dependent upon him for support. The howl of the wolf began to be audible  to him; distant, as yet, but still gradually drawing nearer. To his  mind, a change of the base of his operations was clearly indicated.    Five years before this time he had acquired a block of land in the  Township of Dereham, in the County of Oxford, Upper Canada, where his  wife also owned some property. He now began to cast his eyes anxiously  towards the setting sun, with a view to the rehabilitation of his broken  fortunes. After weighing the matter carefully, he resolved to cross the  Atlantic and pay a visit to Canada, in order to ascertain whether it  would be prudent to remove his family thither. He seems to have been  very deliberate about making up his mind, as he did not set sail from  Liverpool until the month of April, 1817, and did not reach Canada until  early in June. The country delighted him, more especially the Upper  Province; but one with so keen an eye for abuses had not far to look  throughout our fair land in those days for subjects of criticism. Having  made himself acquainted with some of the most glaring iniquities of the  ruling faction, and with the various causes which tended to retard the  progress of the colony, he began to liberate his mind by written and  spoken utterances such as had not theretofore been heard in the  Province. The effect of these appeals to popular sentiment was soon  apparent. People who had long smarted silently under injustice did not  hesitate to make known their discontent. The disturber of the public  tranquillity continued to speak and write, and he made his presence felt  more and more from month to month. Having resolved to engage in business  as a land agent, and to set on foot a huge scheme of immigration to  Canada from Great Britain, he went diligently to work to gather specific  and definite information, and to attack one abuse after another. He  travelled about the country hither and thither, addressed public  meetings, and wrote letters to all the papers that would publish his  animadversions. He was in deadly earnest, and put all the energy of his  impassioned nature into his appeals. In commenting upon the  delinquencies of public officials he did not mince matters, though I  search in vain throughout his voluminous writings for any evidence that  he was ever guilty of a misstatement, or even an exaggeration. He  regaled his readers and hearers with indubitable facts--facts which, for  the most part, were easily susceptible of proof, and which were  eminently calculated to arouse public indignation against the harpies  who reaped where they had sowed not, and who gathered where they had not  strawed.    These proceedings, as may readily be believed, rendered him  inexpressibly obnoxious to the Executive, and to the horde of myrmidons  who held office at their sufferance. But the cup of his transgressions  was not yet full. His next proceeding filled it to overflowing. He  addressed a series of thirty-one printed questions to prominent persons  in different parts of the Province, asking for topographical and other  information. The thirty-first question was so framed that, if truthfully  replied to, it was certain to elicit facts which would form the  groundwork of damnifying strictures on the principal abuses of the time.  \"What, in your opinion,\" asked Mr. Gourlay, \"retards the improvement of  your township in particular, or the Province in general?\" Throughout the  Home District the influence of the Compact was sufficient to prevent any  replies from being returned to these queries. Elsewhere that influence  was partial only, and many answers were received from other districts.  The all but invariable reply to the thirty-first question attributed the  slow development of the country to the Crown and Clergy Reserves. Mr.  Gourlay did not attempt to conceal his intention of publishing the  results of his investigations, and of circulating them all over Great  Britain and Ireland. Having succeeded in arousing a good deal of popular  enthusiasm, he proceeded to strike what he intended to be another  damaging blow. Owing to his exertions, a convention was held at York,  whereat he advocated a petition to the Imperial Parliament, praying for  an investigation into the public affairs of Upper Canada. He also  suggested the sending of deputies to England in support of the petition,  and it is not improbable that such a course would eventually have been  followed, but the petitioners were as yet not fully organized, and  before any of their plans could be brought to maturity their champion's  career of agitation received a sudden and, for the time, an effectual  check.    The oligarchs had taken alarm. If this man were permitted to go on as he  had begun, there would soon be an end of the existing order of things,  which they had so tremendous an interest in preserving. At any cost, and  by whatever means, he must be suppressed. There must be a general and  determined advance against him all along the line.    The prime organizer of this most unrighteous crusade is believed to have  been the Reverend Dr. John Strachan, Rector of York, member of the  Executive Council, supreme director of the lay and ecclesiastical policy  of the Church of England in Upper Canada, champion of the Clergy  Reserves, and what not. It may seem a thankless task to write in strong  depreciation of a man who, in his day and generation, was looked up to  with reverence by a large and influential portion of the community, and  whose memory is still warmly cherished by not a few. But truth is truth,  and the simple fact of the matter is that Dr. Strachan did more to  stifle freedom and retard progress in Upper Canada than any other man  whose name figures in our history. His baneful influence made itself  felt, directly or indirectly, in every one of the public offices.  Wherever liberty of thought and expression, whether as affecting things  spiritual or temporal, ventured to lift its head, there, bludgeon in  hand, stood the great Protestant Pope, ready and eager to strike. It may  perhaps be conceded that he acted according to his earnest convictions.  So, doubtless, did Philip of Spain and Tomas de Torquemada. It is not  going too far to say that Dr. Strachan was utterly incapable of seeing  more than one side of any question involving the interests of himself  and his church. When his cause was a just one, who so fond as he of  appealing to the majesty of the law. When he wished to pervert the law  to his own purposes, who so apt at enjoining a disregard therefor.[7]  There is abundant reason for believing that he was the original  instigator of the Gourlay prosecutions. They were at all events carried  on by his satellites, and fostered by his fullest concurrence and  approval. Their object was to drive Mr. Gourlay out of the country, and  to this end it would appear that the Compact were prepared to go  whatever lengths the necessities of the case might require. A criminal  prosecution for libel was set on foot against the doomed victim of  Executive malevolence, who was arrested and thrown into jail at  Kingston, where he lay for some days. The trial took place on the 15th  of August, 1818, when Mr. Attorney-General Robinson put forth the utmost  power of his eloquence to secure a conviction. In vain. The prisoner  conducted his own defence, and so clearly exposed the flimsiness of the  indictment that the prosecution utterly failed. A second arrest on a  similar charge resulted in another acquittal at Brockville. It was by  this time manifest that no jury could be found subservient enough to  become blind instruments of oppression. The alleged libel consisted of  two paragraphs in a petition to the Prince Regent, drafted by Mr.  Gourlay, approved of, printed and published by sixteen residents of  Niagara District, six of whom were magistrates. These paragraphs  contained a vivid but faithful picture of the abuses existing in the  Crown Lands Department, and it would probably have been difficult to  find a jury anywhere in Upper Canada, some members whereof had not had  personal experience of those abuses. Having failed in two attempts to  convict him of libel, Mr. Gourlay's foes hit on another and more  effectual method of accomplishing his destruction.    By a Provincial statute known as the Alien Act, passed in 1804,  authority was given to certain officials to issue a warrant for the  arrest of any person not having been an inhabitant of the Province for  the preceding six months, who had not taken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#4)"],[1,"    it, as the post leaves in a few minutes. On Saturday afternoon I       left Elgin for Forres, with the hope of better weather. During the       walk I could hardly persuade myself I was out of Aberdeenshire, the       country is so very like, but it is rather flatter. Next morning was       clear and cloudless, and the sun shone bright over a country       drenched and covered with water. I wished that day to reach       Inverness, but a new difficulty appeared. I was told that the       Findhorn was so swollen that no mortal man could get across. I saw       the boatman going to his ferry-house, and I followed him to see how       the matter stood. I soon came to a deep and rapid sweep of water,       which appeared to spread far beyond two narrow banks which might       have formerly bounded it. This I thought to be the Findhorn, but       ere I went many paces farther another sight met my eyes--the real       river itself dashing through the glen with an awful majesty, and       carrying roots, trees, and herbage of every description hurriedly       over its broad breast. In the midst of this scene of devastation       appeared the ruins of a noble bridge, nothing but the piers       remaining, and these dashing to pieces in the furious current. The       stream I had seen at first was the river flowing down the road. The       river fell in the evening, and I crossed the ferry. I had two days       of most delightful weather, and yesterday evening I had a sunset       and moonlight walk by the side of Loch Ness, among the most noble       scenery I ever beheld. The sky was perfectly clear, and without a       single cloud.         \"I must now finish, as the post is going away. If you see Joseph       [_i.e._, the late Joseph Robertson, a constant companion and       attached friend], tell him I will write to him soon and have a deal       to say to him, particularly of my discovering a sculptured stone in       Elgin Cathedral. Notwithstanding the fineness of the evening, this       day is determinedly rainy. If you see any of the H.'s, give Mrs       Grant's compliments.--Adieu for the present; and I remain, my dear       mother, your affectionate and dutiful son,         \"J. HILL BURTON.\"    The writer has heard many farther details of the excursion of which this  letter records the beginning. The temporary clearing up of the weather  referred to was but a hollow truce in the tremendous elemental warfare  of that memorable autumn. The flood described in the Findhorn was but a  faint precursor of the wave sixty feet high, which, a week or two later,  burst through the splendid girdle of rock which at Relugas confines that  loveliest of Scotch rivers, and spread over the fertile plain beneath,  changing it into a sea. At some points in Morayshire, the enormous  overflow of the rivers broke down the banks which bound the ocean, and  permanently changed the coast-line of the country. The most striking and  extraordinary part of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's description of this flood  is an extract from the log of a sailing packet--a sea-going  vessel--which directed its course over and about the plain of Moray,  picking the inhabitants off the roofs of their houses, or such other  elevations as they could reach.    Dr Burton had the good fortune to see the Fall of Foyers during this  great flood, and had the temerity to cross its stream, which lay on his  road, upon a remaining parapet of the fallen bridge!          CHAPTER II.    EDINBURGH.    _Apprenticeship in lawyer's office--Grandfather's letter--J.H. Burton's  letters to his mother, conveying first impressions of Edinburgh, and  account of passing Civil Law trial._      On the completion of his studies, John Burton was apprenticed to a  writer in Aberdeen. He has talked of this period as one of the most  painful of his life. He was utterly unable to master the routine of  office-work, or to submit to its restraints; and one of his most joyful  days was that in which his indentures were, by mutual desire, cancelled.    A piece of yellow old paper was found in Dr Burton's desk when he died.  It was a letter written some fifty-five years before, and had probably  lain there during all these years. As it refers to this period of Dr  Burton's life, it may be given. It seems fully to bear out the writer's  conception of the unsympathising character of the intercourse between  Mrs Burton and her family. No stronger incentive to exertion could have  been offered to a man of Dr Burton's character, than the desire to  falsify the implied prediction of such a missive. With a view to its  effect in this way it had probably been given him by his mother. It is  an entire letter, and the whole is here printed.         \"GRANDHOLM, _June 6th_.         \"DEAR ELIZA,--I have this day received a letter from my father,       part of which I think it necessary to transcribe to you, as the       best mode of giving you his meaning.         \"'The account of John Burton's being in such an idle unemployed way       displeases me much. I wish you, Mary, would speak to his mother on       the subject; tell her I would have acquainted her with my       displeasure before now, only, on account of her misfortune in her       family [this must refer to the death of her son David], I deferred       what I ought to have done. Why was he taken away from his       attendance at Mr Winchester's office? Doctor Dauney said he could       not be better than with him, as there was plenty of business, such       as was going. Tell her that as I have neither funds nor inclination       to support idle gentlemen, or rather vagabonds, I have given       directions to Mr Alcock not to pay up her next half-year's annuity,       till he hears from me on the subject, and until she gives you       satisfactory accounts concerning her son's return to Mr       Winchester's office or otherwise. Tell her not to write to me, but       to act as is her duty.'\"         The sister here continues, \"I hope Mary [Dr Burton's only sister,       the youngest child of his mother] continues well, and that you will       not fail to give me an answer to this, as you see it will be       absolutely necessary to give attention to the subject. Barbara       continues very unwell.--I remain yours sincerely, M. PATON.\"    Whether the threat conveyed in this letter was executed, the writer has  now no means of knowing. The expression of it alone was cruel  enough--the threat to starve a poor mother into forcing a son to  continue a business utterly repugnant to him. Mrs Burton, however, did  not protect herself by the sacrifice of her son. She believed in her  son's powers, and acted on her belief in spite of all opposition; and  she had her reward. She lived to see her son gaining fame in letters,  and to find in him the utmost devotion a son can show to a mother. He  never forgot or failed to acknowledge his obligations to her. These were  undoubtedly great. She not only gave him, in part personally, his  education, but when that was finished, and she hoped to find peace for  her declining years in the little home she had prepared for herself, she  sacrificed that also to her hope of her son's advancement--her faith in  his talents and perseverance.    With the death of her husband, perhaps also on account of that of her  father, and the loss of her two little sons, Mrs Burton's pecuniary  position seems to have become somewhat easier. Whilst her son John was  destined for business in Aberdeen, she had built a small house for her  own occupation in the neighbourhood. When he set his mind on the higher  walk of his profession, and desired to come to the Scotch Bar, the  necessary expense could only be compassed by the devoted mother selling  her newly built house, and casting in her lot with her son. She, her  young daughter, and an Aberdeenshire maiden (so primitive in her ideas,  that she conceived the only way of reaching Edinburgh from Warriston  must be by _wading_ the Water of Leith), followed John to Edinburgh, and  took up their abode in a very small house on the north side of Warriston  Crescent in the year 1831.    Dr Burton was no great letter-writer. After he began, as he said, to  write for print, he considered it waste of time to write anything which  was not to be printed, except in briefest form. His letters to his wife  and family during absences on the Continent or elsewhere, seldom  contained more than a bare itinerary, past and future, often referring  them for particulars to the article in 'Blackwood,' which was to grow  out of his travels.    His mother was naturally the recipient of the writing which came before  the days of print,--before the days of penny postage also. Almost every  letter contains a history of how his mother's last reached him, as well  as how he hoped to have that which he is writing conveyed to her without  paying the awful tax of postage.    The next letters here offered belong to the beginning of his Edinburgh  life, and relate to a feat of mental exertion equal to his bodily  performances. He was at the time living in lodgings, for the purpose of  passing his legal examinations preparatory to coming to the Bar; but he  may be allowed to give the history of this part of his life entirely in  his own words.         \"EDINBURGH, _3d Nov. 1830_.         \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I have just arrived here, and as there is a       friend of Mr Dauney's just about to set off for Aberdeen, I       preferred letting you get a bit of a note or so to sending you a       newspaper. Of course I have nothing to write you about but my own       concerns. A delightful moonlight night for travelling, but the       coach rather full: there were three nice children, with whom I       contrived to amuse myself.
