These had  succeeded in cutting their way through the enemy; the rest had been  surrounded, and died fighting valiantly, and were almost buried  among the dead bodies of their antagonists.    But this was not to be the finale of the Boer resistance to the wild  Zulu. The above tragic engagement between the Englishmen and Zulus  took place in April 1838. By December of the same year they had  gathered themselves under the banner of their fine leader Andries  Pretorius, a farmer from the district of Graff Reinet, and started  forth again to meet the treacherous Dingaan, and pay him the debt  they owed him.    A word or two of this Pretorius, after whom the now notable town of  Pretoria was named. He was a born leader of men: he was a Cromwell  in his way. At that date he was forty years of age, in the prime of  strength and manhood. He was tall, and vigorous in mind as well as  in body, calm and deliberating in counsel, but prompt and fiery in  action. His descent is traced from one Johannes Pretorius, son of a  clergyman at Goeree in South Holland, one of the very early  settlers--a pious and worthy man, whose piety and worth had been  inherited by several generations. Like the rest of his countrymen,  Pretorius would brook no control. Though he was indubitably brave  and immensely capable, he had the conservative instincts of his  race. He shrunk from all innovations, he disliked everything  connected with civilisation that might in the smallest degree  interfere with the personal liberty of the individual. Freedom was  as the very breath of his nostrils, and here was the great link  between this really exceptional man and the body of his pastoral  followers.    Pretorius, bent on the punishment of the treachery of Dingaan, set  out, as has been said, with his expedition in the winter of 1838.  This expedition has been named by the Boers the Win Commando. He had  but three small pieces of cannon and a force composed of about four  hundred white men and some native auxiliaries, yet the admirable  tactics of Pretorius, the stout hearts and fine shooting of his  followers, combined to bring about a victory over the Zulus. These  were totally routed, and lost one third of their number.    The bravery and splendid persistence of the Boers filled all hearts  with admiration, particularly when, after several well-directed  attacks, they eventually succeeded in utterly breaking the Zulu  power. Dingaan was dethroned and driven into exile, and his kraal  and property burnt. A Christian burial service was read over the  place where lay the bones of the assassinated Retief and his  companions. The date, the 16th December 1838, on which the Zulu  power met its first check from white men, is one ever remembered in  Boer history. It goes by the name of Dingaan's Day, and is annually  celebrated with great rejoicings throughout the Transvaal.    The Boers had now succeeded in inspiring wholesome awe in the heart  of Panda, the new chieftain who occupied the place once held by his  brother, the exiled Dingaan. He was not a person of bellicose  disposition, and thinking discretion the better part of valour, was  ready enough to swear to keep peace with his late enemies. In these  circumstances the Boers with prayer and thanksgiving were able to  pursue the promptings of their long-checked ambition. Soon several  hundreds of waggons drawn by long teams of oxen came lumbering into  Natal, for the purpose of establishing there the Republic, which had  so often been planned out in imagination and never yet found any but  an abortive existence. This ideal State was eventually formed and  called the Republic of Natalia, and it enjoyed for several years an  independent existence.    As Natal became the first cause of armed conflict between the  British and the Boers, its then position in regard to the  authorities at the Cape may as well be reviewed. Though the new  Republic maintained its perfectly independent existence, its  inhabitants were still mentioned by the Governor of Cape Colony as  British subjects. It must be remembered that prior to the  occupation of Natal by the Boers, and the formation of their  cherished Republic, the Governor of Cape Colony had issued a  proclamation announcing his intention of occupying Natal later on,  and stating that the emigrants--who were then making active  preparations for the attack of Dingaan--- were British subjects. In  Great Britain, however, the authorities had not yet decided to  follow the advice so often given by their representatives at the  Cape. They were still declaring it inexpedient to extend their  territory, and likewise their responsibilities, in South Africa. But  the incursion of the Boers in the neighbourhood of Port Natal put a  new complexion on affairs. The British Government began to open its  eyes to the value of a seaport, with two good harbours on the South  African coast, as a colonial possession. It could not fail to  recognise also that the members of the new State were already bitter  foes to the British and their ways; and that it would be dangerous  to allow them to establish themselves as an independent power on the  coast, and entirely throw off their duty of allegiance. Accordingly  Sir George Napier, the then Governor of the Cape, sent troops to  occupy Natal. He remained undecided as to the mode of dealing with  the emigrant Boers, however, for, while declaring them British  subjects, he yet was not prepared to afford them protection from  attacks of the natives. It is scarcely surprising that this  half-and-half paternity of the Government failed to satisfy the men  whose kith and kin had fallen in their numbers at Weenen and the  Hill of Blood, and the consequent disaffection of the Boers grew  deeper as signs of British authority increased.    But at first, in the rest of their territory outside Natal the Boer  Government remained unmolested. Their district was bounded by the  sea and the Drakenberg mountains, the Tugela and Umzimubu Rivers,  and there for a time things went well. Pretorius was Commandant  General in Natal, Potgieter Chief Commandant in the allied Western  Districts. The legislative power was in the hands of a Volksraad of  twenty-four members, whose ways were more vacillating and erratic  than advantageous. \"Every man for himself and God for all\" seemed to  be the convenient motto of this assembly, except perhaps on urgent  occasions, when Pretorius and Potgieter were called upon as joint  dictators to settle some knotty problem relating to external  affairs.    At the close of 1840 this Volksraad commenced negotiations with the  Cape Government with a view to getting their independence formally  recognised. The Governor at the Cape was again in the old quandary.  While he personally desired to put an end to troubles from within  and without by establishing a strong government over the whole  country, he was crippled by the Ministry at home, which was  consistent in maintaining its policy of inconsistency, and tried to  maintain its hold on the Cape, while steadily refusing to increase  Great Britain's responsibility in South Africa.    The demands of the Volksraad (presented in January 1841) were  scarcely acceptable at headquarters. The nature of them is  interesting, and shows the then attitude of people who described  themselves as \"willing and desirous to enter into a perpetual  alliance with the Government of Her Majesty.\"    They bargained that the Republic of Natalia was to be acknowledged  as a free and independent State, in close alliance with the British  Government. If attacked by sea by any other power, Great Britain  might interpose either by negotiation or arms. If Great Britain were  at war, however, the Republic was to remain neutral. Wine, strong  liquors, and articles \"prejudicial to this Republic,\" were to be  taxed more highly than other things, which would be taxed as for a  British Colony. British subjects residing in the Republic would have  equal protection, and the same taxes as burghers, while in case of  war every assistance would be given to a British or Colonial force  marching through the territory. The slave trade would not be  permitted, and every facility for the propagation of the Gospel  among the neighbouring tribes would be afforded. The Republic  guaranteed to make no hostile movements against natives in the  direction of the Colony without permission of the Governor, unless  circumstances of violence, or the inroad of tribes, rendered  immediate action obligatory.    There were other clauses of less importance which need not be  specified. Suffice it to say, that while these terms were being  considered, a cattle and slave-stealing Boer raid, headed by  Pretorius, took place. The excuse for the proceeding was the lifting  of certain of their own cattle, but the action served as an object  lesson for those in power at the Cape. The Volksraad was politely  informed that the Boers were still British subjects, and a letter  from the Home Government to Sir George Napier was received, stating  that Her Majesty \"could not acknowledge a portion of her own  subjects as an independent Republic, but that on their receiving a  military force from the Colony, their trade would be placed on the  footing of the trade of a British possession.\" But the Boers flouted  authority--they refused to accept the situation. They put forth a  proclamation appealing against the oppression of man and to the  justice of God, with all the fervour of the Old Testament Christians  they were.    The arrogance of Pretorius and his crew had now so seriously  increased that Sir George Napier, seeing danger ahead, decided to  establish a camp near the border of the State, and Durban was  occupied. Captain Smith, in command of some three hundred men, made  a rapid march across country to Natal, merely to be informed that  the Boers had placed themselves under the protection of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23731"],[0,"A Martian Odyssey (#4)"],[1,"s.    \"Tweel saw the movement first. The top tiers of bricks were heaving,  shaking, and suddenly slid down the sides with a thin crash. And  then--something--something was coming out!    \"A long, silvery-grey arm appeared, dragging after it an armored body.  Armored, I mean, with scales, silver-grey and dull-shining. The arm  heaved the body out of the hole; the beast crashed to the sand.    \"It was a nondescript creature--body like a big grey cask, arm and a  sort of mouth-hole at one end; stiff, pointed tail at the other--and  that's all. No other limbs, no eyes, ears, nose--nothing! The thing  dragged itself a few yards, inserted its pointed tail in the sand,  pushed itself upright, and just sat.    \"Tweel and I watched it for ten minutes before it moved. Then, with a  creaking and rustling like--oh, like crumpling stiff paper--its arm  moved to the mouth-hole and out came a brick! The arm placed the brick  carefully on the ground, and the thing was still again.    \"Another ten minutes--another brick. Just one of Nature's bricklayers.  I was about to slip away and move on when Tweel pointed at the thing and  said 'rock'! I went 'huh?' and he said it again. Then, to the  accompaniment of some of his trilling, he said, 'No--no--,' and gave two  or three whistling breaths.    \"Well, I got his meaning, for a wonder! I said, 'No breath?' and  demonstrated the word. Tweel was ecstatic; he said, 'Yes, yes, yes! No,  no, no breet!' Then he gave a leap and sailed out to land on his nose  about one pace from the monster!    \"I was startled, you can imagine! The arm was going up for a brick, and  I expected to see Tweel caught and mangled, but--nothing happened! Tweel  pounded on the creature, and the arm took the brick and placed it neatly  beside the first. Tweel rapped on its body again, and said 'rock,' and I  got up nerve enough to take a look myself.    \"Tweel was right again. The creature was rock, and it didn't breathe!\"    \"How you know?\" snapped Leroy, his black eyes blazing interest.    \"Because I'm a chemist. The beast was made of silica! There must have  been pure silicon in the sand, and it lived on that. Get it? We, and  Tweel, and those plants out there, and even the biopods are _carbon_  life; this thing lived by a different set of chemical reactions. It was  silicon life!\"    \"_La vie silicieuse!_\" shouted Leroy. \"I have suspect, and now it is  proof! I must go see! _Il faut que je--_\"    \"All right! All right!\" said Jarvis. \"You can go see. Anyhow, there the  thing was, alive and yet not alive, moving every ten minutes, and then  only to remove a brick. Those bricks were its waste matter. See,  Frenchy? We're carbon, and our waste is carbon dioxide, and this thing  is silicon, and _its_ waste is silicon dioxide--silica. But silica is a  solid, hence the bricks. And it builds itself in, and when it is  covered, it moves over to a fresh place to start over. No wonder it  creaked! A living creature half a million years old!\"    \"How you know how old?\" Leroy was frantic.    \"We trailed its pyramids from the beginning, didn't we? If this weren't  the original pyramid builder, the series would have ended somewhere  before we found him, wouldn't it?--ended and started over with the small  ones. That's simple enough, isn't it?    \"But he reproduces, or tries to. Before the third brick came out, there  was a little rustle and out popped a whole stream of those little  crystal balls. They're his spores, or eggs, or seeds--call 'em what you  want. They went bouncing by across Xanthus just as they'd bounced by us  back in the Mare Chronium. I've a hunch how they work, too--this is for  your information, Leroy. I think the crystal shell of silica is no more  than a protective covering, like an eggshell, and that the active  principle is the smell inside. It's some sort of gas that attacks  silicon, and if the shell is broken near a supply of that element, some  reaction starts that ultimately develops into a beast like that one.\"    \"You should try!\" exclaimed the little Frenchman. \"We must break one to  see!\"    \"Yeah? Well, I did. I smashed a couple against the sand. Would you like  to come back in about ten thousand years to see if I planted some  pyramid monsters? You'd most likely be able to tell by that time!\"  Jarvis paused and drew a deep breath. \"Lord! That queer creature! Do you  picture it? Blind, deaf, nerveless, brainless--just a mechanism, and  yet--immortal! Bound to go on making bricks, building pyramids, as long  as silicon and oxygen exist, and even afterwards it'll just stop. It  won't be dead. If the accidents of a million years bring it its food  again, there it'll be, ready to run again, while brains and  civilizations are part of the past. A queer beast--yet I met a stranger  one!\"    \"If you did, it must have been in your dreams!\" growled Harrison.    \"You're right!\" said Jarvis soberly. \"In a way, you're right. The  dream-beast! That's the best name for it--and it's the most fiendish,  terrifying creation one could imagine! More dangerous than a lion, more  insidious than a snake!\"    \"Tell me!\" begged Leroy. \"I must go see!\"    \"Not _this_ devil!\" He paused again. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"Tweel and I  left the pyramid creature and plowed along through Xanthus. I was tired  and a little disheartened by Putz's failure to pick me up, and Tweel's  trilling got on my nerves, as did his flying nosedives. So I just strode  along without a word, hour after hour across that monotonous desert.    \"Toward mid-afternoon we came in sight of a low dark line on the  horizon. I knew what it was. It was a canal; I'd crossed it in the  rocket and it meant that we were just one-third of the way across  Xanthus. Pleasant thought, wasn't it? And still, I was keeping up to  schedule.    \"We approached the canal slowly; I remembered that this one was bordered  by a wide fringe of vegetation and that Mud-heap City was on it.    \"I was tired, as I said. I kept thinking of a good hot meal, and then  from that I jumped to reflections of how nice and home-like even Borneo  would seem after this crazy planet, and from that, to thoughts of little  old New York, and then to thinking about a girl I know there--Fancy  Long. Know her?\"    \"Vision entertainer,\" said Harrison. \"I've tuned her in. Nice  blonde--dances and sings on the _Yerba Mate_ hour.\"    \"That's her,\" said Jarvis ungrammatically. \"I know her pretty well--just  friends, get me?--though she came down to see us off in the _Ares_.  Well, I was thinking about her, feeling pretty lonesome, and all the  time we were approaching that line of rubbery plants.    \"And then--I said, 'What 'n Hell!' and stared. And there she was--Fancy  Long, standing plain as day under one of those crack-brained trees, and  smiling and waving just the way I remembered her when we left!\"    \"Now you're nuts, too!\" observed the captain.    \"Boy, I almost agreed with you! I stared and pinched myself and closed  my eyes and then stared again--and every time, there was Fancy Long  smiling and waving! Tweel saw something, too; he was trilling and  clucking away, but I scarcely heard him. I was bounding toward her over  the sand, too amazed even to ask myself questions.    \"I wasn't twenty feet from her when Tweel caught me with one of his  flying leaps. He grabbed my arm, yelling, 'No--no--no!' in his squeaky  voice. I tried to shake him off--he was as light as if he were built of  bamboo--but he dug his claws in and yelled. And finally some sort of  sanity returned to me and I stopped less than ten feet from her. There  she stood, looking as solid as Putz's head!\"    \"Vot?\" said the engineer.    \"She smiled and waved, and waved and smiled, and I stood there dumb as  Leroy, while Tweel squeaked and chattered. I _knew_ it couldn't be real,  yet--there she was!    \"Finally I said, 'Fancy! Fancy Long!' She just kept on smiling and  waving, but looking as real as if I hadn't left her thirty-seven million  miles away.    \"Tweel had his glass pistol out, pointing it at her. I grabbed his arm,  but he tried to push me away. He pointed at her and said, 'No breet! No  breet!' and I understood that he meant that the Fancy Long thing wasn't  alive. Man, my head was whirling!    \"Still, it gave me the jitters to see him pointing his weapon at her. I  don't know why I stood there watching him take careful aim, but I did.  Then he squeezed the handle of his weapon; there was a little puff of  steam, and Fancy Long was gone! And in her place was one of those  writhing, black, rope-armed horrors like the one I'd saved Tweel from!    \"The dream-beast! I stood there dizzy, watching it die while Tweel  trilled and whistled. Finally he touched my arm, pointed at the twisting  thing, and said, 'You one-one-two, he one-one-two.' After he'd repeated  it eight or ten times, I got it. Do any of you?\"    \"_Oui!_\" shrilled Leroy. \"_Moi--je le comprends!_ He mean you think of  something, the beast he know, and you see it! _Un chien_--a hungry dog,  he would see the big bone with meat! Or smell it--not?\"    \"Right!\" said Jarvis. \"The dream-beast uses its victim's longings and  desires to trap its prey. The bird at nesting season would see its mate,  the fox, prowling for its own prey, would see a helpless rabbit!\"    \"How he do?\" queried Leroy.    \"How do I know? How does a snake back on earth charm a bird into its  very jaws? And aren't there deep-sea fish that lure their victims into  their mouths? Lord!\" Jarvis shuddered. \"Do you see how insidious the  monster is? We're warned now--but henceforth we can't trust even our  eyes. You might see me--I might see one of you--and back of it may be  nothing but another of those black horrors!\"    \"How'd your friend know?\" asked the captain abruptly.    \"Tweel? I wonder! Perhaps he was thinking of something that couldn't  possibly have interested me, and when I started to run, he realized  that I saw something different and was warned.
