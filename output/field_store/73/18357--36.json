[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2412"],[0,"The Categories (#4)"],[1," knowledge of something, attitude is the  attitude of something. So it is with all other relatives that have been  mentioned. Those terms, then, are called relative, the nature of which  is explained by reference to something else, the preposition 'of' or  some other preposition being used to indicate the relation. Thus, one  mountain is called great in comparison with another; for the  mountain claims this attribute by comparison with something. Again,  that which is called similar must be similar to something else, and all  other such attributes have this external reference. It is to be noted  that lying and standing and sitting are particular attitudes, but  attitude is itself a relative term. To lie, to stand, to be seated, are  not themselves attitudes, but take their name from the aforesaid  attitudes.    It is possible for relatives to have contraries. Thus virtue has a  contrary, vice, these both being relatives; knowledge, too, has a  contrary, ignorance. But this is not the mark of all relatives;  'double' and 'triple' have no contrary, nor indeed has any such term.    It also appears that relatives can admit of variation of degree. For  'like' and 'unlike', 'equal' and 'unequal', have the modifications  'more' and 'less' applied to them, and each of these is relative in  character: for the terms 'like' and 'unequal' bear a  reference to something external. Yet, again, it is not every relative  term that admits of variation of degree. No term such as 'double'  admits of this modification. All relatives have correlatives: by the  term 'slave' we mean the slave of a master, by the term 'master', the  master of a slave; by 'double', the double of its half; by 'half', the  half of its double; by 'greater', greater than that which is less; by  'less', less than that which is greater.    So it is with every other relative term; but the case we use to express  the correlation differs in some instances. Thus, by knowledge we mean  knowledge of the knowable; by the knowable, that which is to be  apprehended by knowledge; by perception, perception of the perceptible;  by the perceptible, that which is apprehended by perception.    Sometimes, however, reciprocity of correlation does not appear to  exist. This comes about when a blunder is made, and that to which the  relative is related is not accurately stated. If a man states that a  wing is necessarily relative to a bird, the connexion between these two  will not be reciprocal, for it will not be possible to say that a bird  is a bird by reason of its wings. The reason is that the original  statement was inaccurate, for the wing is not said to be relative to  the bird qua bird, since many creatures besides birds have wings, but  qua winged creature. If, then, the statement is made accurate, the  connexion will be reciprocal, for we can speak of a wing, having  reference necessarily to a winged creature, and of a winged creature as  being such because of its wings.    Occasionally, perhaps, it is necessary to coin words, if no word exists  by which a correlation can adequately be explained. If we define a  rudder as necessarily having reference to a boat, our definition will  not be appropriate, for the rudder does not have this reference to a  boat qua boat, as there are boats which have no rudders. Thus we cannot  use the terms reciprocally, for the word 'boat' cannot be said to find  its explanation in the word 'rudder'. As there is no existing word, our  definition would perhaps be more accurate if we coined some word like  'ruddered' as the correlative of 'rudder'. If we express ourselves thus  accurately, at any rate the terms are reciprocally connected, for the  'ruddered' thing is 'ruddered' in virtue of its rudder. So it is in all  other cases. A head will be more accurately defined as the correlative  of that which is 'headed', than as that of an animal, for the animal  does not have a head qua animal, since many animals have no head.    Thus we may perhaps most easily comprehend that to which a thing is  related, when a name does not exist, if, from that which has a name, we  derive a new name, and apply it to that with which the first is  reciprocally connected, as in the aforesaid instances, when we derived  the word 'winged' from 'wing' and from 'rudder'.    All relatives, then, if properly defined, have a correlative. I add  this condition because, if that to which they are related is stated as  haphazard and not accurately, the two are not found to be  interdependent. Let me state what I mean more clearly. Even in the case  of acknowledged correlatives, and where names exist for each, there  will be no interdependence if one of the two is denoted, not by that  name which expresses the correlative notion, but by one of irrelevant  significance. The term 'slave', if defined as related, not to a master,  but to a man, or a biped, or anything of that sort, is not reciprocally  connected with that in relation to which it is defined, for the  statement is not exact. Further, if one thing is said to be correlative  with another, and the terminology used is correct, then, though all  irrelevant attributes should be removed, and only that one attribute  left in virtue of which it was correctly stated to be correlative with  that other, the stated correlation will still exist. If the correlative  of 'the slave' is said to be 'the master', then, though all irrelevant  attributes of the said 'master', such as 'biped', 'receptive of  knowledge', 'human', should be removed, and the attribute 'master'  alone left, the stated correlation existing between him and the slave  will remain the same, for it is of a master that a slave is said to be  the slave. On the other hand, if, of two correlatives, one is not  correctly termed, then, when all other attributes are removed and that  alone is left in virtue of which it was stated to be correlative, the  stated correlation will be found to have disappeared.    For suppose the correlative of 'the slave' should be said to be 'the  man', or the correlative of 'the wing' is 'the bird'; if the attribute  'master' be withdrawn from 'the man', the correlation between 'the man'  and 'the slave' will cease to exist, for if the man is not a master,  the slave is not a slave. Similarly, if the attribute 'winged' be  withdrawn from 'the bird', 'the wing' will no longer be relative; for  if the so-called correlative is not winged, it follows that 'the wing'  has no correlative.    Thus it is essential that the correlated terms should be exactly  designated; if there is a name existing, the statement will be easy; if  not, it is doubtless our duty to construct names. When the terminology  is thus correct, it is evident that all correlatives are interdependent.    Correlatives are thought to come into existence simultaneously. This is  for the most part true, as in the case of the double and the half. The  existence of the half necessitates the existence of that of which it is  a half. Similarly the existence of a master necessitates the existence  of a slave, and that of a slave implies that of a master; these are  merely instances of a general rule. Moreover, they cancel one another;  for if there is no double it follows that there is no half, and vice  versa; this rule also applies to all such correlatives. Yet it does not  appear to be true in all cases that correlatives come into existence  simultaneously. The object of knowledge would appear to exist before  knowledge itself, for it is usually the case that we acquire knowledge  of objects already existing; it would be difficult, if not impossible,  to find a branch of knowledge the beginning of the existence of which  was contemporaneous with that of its object.    Again, while the object of knowledge, if it ceases to exist, cancels at  the same time the knowledge which was its correlative, the converse of  this is not true. It is true that if the object of knowledge does not  exist there can be no knowledge: for there will no longer be anything  to know. Yet it is equally true that, if knowledge of a certain object  does not exist, the object may nevertheless quite well exist. Thus, in  the case of the squaring of the circle, if indeed that process is an  object of knowledge, though it itself exists as an object of knowledge,  yet the knowledge of it has not yet come into existence. Again, if all  animals ceased to exist, there would be no knowledge, but there might  yet be many objects of knowledge.    This is likewise the case with regard to perception: for the object of  perception is, it appears, prior to the act of perception. If the  perceptible is annihilated, perception also will cease to exist; but  the annihilation of perception does not cancel the existence of the  perceptible. For perception implies a body perceived and a body in  which perception takes place. Now if that which is perceptible is  annihilated, it follows that the body is annihilated, for the body is a  perceptible thing; and if the body does not exist, it follows that  perception also ceases to exist. Thus the annihilation of the  perceptible involves that of perception.    But the annihilation of perception does not involve that of the  perceptible. For if the animal is annihilated, it follows that  perception also is annihilated, but perceptibles such as body, heat,  sweetness, bitterness, and so on, will remain.    Again, perception is generated at the same time as the perceiving  subject, for it comes into existence at the same time as the animal.  But the perceptible surely exists before perception; for fire and water  and such elements, out of which the animal is itself composed, exist  before the animal is an animal at all, and before perception. Thus it  would seem that the perceptible exists before perception.    It may be questioned whether it is true that no substance is relative,  as seems to be the case, or whether exception is to be made in the case  of certain secondary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#4)"],[1,"& was drown'd. He       was about 16 or 18 years of age.\"    Advertisements of \"Mens and Boys Scates\" appear in the _Boston Gazette_,  of 1749, and the _Boston Evening Post_, of 1758. The February _News  Letter_, of 1769, has a notice of the sale of \"Best Holland Scates of  Different Sizes.\"    In the list of goods on board a prize taken by a privateersman in 1712  were \"Boxes of Toys.\" Higginson, writing to his brother in 1695, told  him that \"toys would sell if in small quantity.\" In exceeding small  quantity one would fancy. In 1743 the _Boston News Letter_ advertised  \"English and Dutch Toys for Children.\" Not until October, 1771, on the  lists of the Boston shop-keepers, who seemed to advertise and to sell  every known article of dry goods, hardware, house furnishing, ornament,  dress and food, came that single but pleasure-filled item \"Boys  Marbles.\" \"Battledores and Shuttles\" appeared in 1761. I know that no  little maids could ever have lived without dolls, not even the  serious-minded daughters of the Pilgrims; but the only dolls that were  advertised in colonial newspapers were the \"London drest babys\" of  milliners and mantua-makers, that were sent over to serve as fashion  plates for modish New England dames. A few century-old dolls still  survive Revolutionary times, wooden-faced monstrosities, shapeless and  mean, but doubtless well-beloved and cherished in the days of their  youth.    As years rolled by and eighteenth century frivolity and worldliness took  the place of Puritan sobriety and religion, New England children shared  with their elders in that growing love of amusement, which found but few  and inadequate methods of expression in the lives of either old or  young. In the year 1771 there was sent from Nova Scotia a young miss of  New England parentage--Anna Green Winslow--to live with her aunt and  receive a \"finishing\" in Boston schools. For the edification of her  parents and her own practice in penmanship, this bright little maid kept  a diary, of which portions have been preserved, and which I do not  hesitate to say is the most sprightly record of the daily life of a girl  of her age that I have ever read. There is not a dull word in it, and  every page has some statement of historical value. She was twelve years  old shortly after the diary was begun, and she then had a \"coming-out  party\"--she became a \"miss in her teens.\" To this rout only young ladies  of her own age and in the most elegant Boston society were invited--no  rough Boston boys. Miss Anna has written for us more than one prim and  quaint little picture of similar parties--here is one of her clear and  stiff little descriptions; and a graphic account also of the evening  dress of a young girl at that time.         \"I have now the pleasure to give you the result Viz; a very genteel       well regulated assembly which we had at Mr. Soleys last evening,       Miss Soley being mistress of the ceremony. Miss Soley desired me to       assist Miss Hannah in making out a list of guests which I did.       Sometime since I wrote all the invitation cards. There was a large       company assembled in a large handsome upper room in the new end of       the house. We had two fiddles and I had the honor to open the       diversion of the evening in a minuet with Miss Soley. Here follows       a list of the company as we form'd for country-dancing. Miss Soley       and Miss Anna Green Winslow; Miss Calif and Miss Scott; Miss       Williams and Miss McLarth; Miss Codman and Miss Winslow; Miss Ives       and Miss Coffin; Miss Scollay and Miss Bella Coffin; Miss Waldo and       Miss Quinsey; Miss Glover and Miss Draper; Miss Hubbard and Miss       Cregur (usually pronounced Kicker) and two Miss Sheafs were invited       but were sick or sorry and beg'd to be excused.         \"There was a little Miss Russel and little ones of the family       present who could not dance. As spectators there were Mr. & Mrs.       Deming, Mr. & Mrs. Sweetser, Mr. and Mrs. Soley, Mr. & Mrs. Claney,       Mrs. Draper, Miss Orice, Miss Hannah--our treat was nuts, raisins,       cakes, Wine, punch hot and cold all in great plenty. We had a very       agreeable evening from 5 to 10 o'clock. For variety we woo'd a       widow, hunted the whistle, threaded the needle, & while the company       was collecting we diverted ourselves with playing of pawns--_no       rudeness_ Mamma I assure you. Aunt Deming desires you would       particularly observe that the elderly part of the Company were       _Spectators only_, that they mixed not in either of the       above-described scenes.         \"I was dressed in my yelloe coat, black bib and apron, black       feathers on my head, my paste comb and all my paste garnet       marquasett & jet pins, together with my silver plume--my locket,       rings, black collar round my neck, black mitts and yards of blue       ribbon (black and blue is high tast) striped tucker & ruffles (not       my best) and my silk shoes completed my dress.\"    How clear the picture: can you not see it--the low raftered chamber  softly alight with candles on mantel-tree and in sconces; the two  fiddles soberly squeaking: the rows of demure little Boston maids, all  of New England Brahmin blood, in high rolls, with nodding plumes and  sparkling combs, with ruffles and mitts, little miniatures of their  elegant mammas, soberly walking and curtseying through the stately  minuet \"with no rudeness I can assure you;\" and discreetly partaking of  hot and cold punch afterward.    There came at this time to another lady in this Boston court circle a  grandchild eight years of age, from the Barbadoes, to also attend Boston  schools. Missy left her grandmother's house in high dudgeon because she  could not have wine at all her meals. And her parents upheld her, saying  she had been brought up a lady and must have wine when she wished it.  Evidently Cobbett's statement of the free drinking of wine, cider, and  beer by American children was true--as Anna Green Winslow's \"treat\"  would also show.    Though Puritan children had few recreations and amusements, they must  have enjoyed a very cheerful, happy home life. Large families abounded.  Cotton Mather says:         \"One woman had not less than twenty-two children, and another had       no less than twenty-three children by one husband whereof nineteen       lived to mans estate, and a third who was mother to seven and       twenty children.\"    Sir William Phips was one of twenty-six children, all with the same  mother. Printer Green had thirty children. The Rev. John Sherman, of  Watertown, had twenty-six children by two wives--twenty by his last  wife. The Rev. Samuel Willard, first minister to Groton, had twenty  children, and his father had seventeen children. Benjamin Franklin was  one of a family of seventeen. Charles Francis Adams has told us of the  fruitful vines of old Braintree.    The little Puritans rejoiced in some very singular names, the offspring  of Roger Clap being good examples: Experience, Waitstill, Preserved,  Hopestill, Wait, Thanks, Desire, Unite, and Supply.    Of the food given Puritan children we know but little. In an old almanac  of the eighteenth century I find a few sentences of advice as to the  \"Easy Rearing of Children.\" The writer urges that boys as soon as they  can run alone go without hats to harden them, and if possible sleep  without night-caps, as soon as they have any hair. He advises always to  wet children's feet in cold water and thus make them (the feet) tough,  and also to have children wear thin-soled shoes \"that the wet may come  freely in.\" He says young children should never be allowed to drink cold  drinks, but should always have their beer a little heated; that it is  \"best to feed them on Milk, Pottage, Flummery, Bread, and Cheese, and  not let them drink their beer till they have first eaten a piece of  Brown Bread.\" Fancy a young child nowadays making a meal of brown bread  and cheese with warm beer! He suggests that they drink but little wine  or liquor, and sleep on quilts instead of feathers. In such ways were  reared our Revolutionary heroes.    Of the dazzling and beautiful array in our modern confectioners' shops  little Priscilla and Hate-Evil could never have dreamed, even in  visions. A few comfit-makers made \"Lemon Pil Candy, Angelica Candy,  Candy'd Eryngo Root & Carroway Comfits;\" and a few sweetmeats came to  port in foreign vessels, \"Sugar'd Corrinder Seeds,\" \"Glaz'd Almonds,\"  and strings of rock-candy. Whole jars of the latter adamantine,  crystalline, saccharine delight graced the shelves of many a colonial  cupboard. And I suppose favored Salem children, the happy sons and  daughters of opulent epicurean Salem shipowners, had even in colonial  days Black Jacks and Salem Gibraltars. The first-named dainties, though  dearly loved by Salem lads and lasses, always bore--indeed, do still  bear--too strong a flavor of liquorice, too haunting a medicinal  suggestion to be loved by other children of the Puritans. As an  instance, on a large scale, of the retributive fate that always pursues  the candy-eating wight, I state that the good ship Ann and Hope brought  into Providence one hundred years ago, as part of her cargo, eight boxes  of sweetmeats and twenty tubs of sugar candy, and on the succeeding  voyage sternly fetched no sweets, but brought instead forty-eight boxes  of rhubarb.    The children doubtless had prunes, figs, \"courance,\" and I know they had  \"Raisins of the Sun\" and \"Bloom Raisins\" galore. Advertisements of all  these fruits appear in the earliest newspapers. Though \"China Oranges\"  were frequently given to and by Judge Sewall, I have not found them  advertised for sale till Revolutionary times, and I fancy few children  had then tasted them. The native and domestic fruits were plentiful, but  many of them were poor. The apples and pears and Kentish cherries were  better than the peaches and grapes. The"]]]
