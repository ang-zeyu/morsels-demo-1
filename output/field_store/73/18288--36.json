[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22605"],[0,"Book-Lovers, Bibliomaniacs and Book Clubs (#4)"],[1,"inflexible  attachment; and that object was Dame Drama.\"    In Dibdin's Bibliomaniacal romance, \"Philemon\" is credited with the  following narrative concerning one who was probably a bibliomaniac in  all that the compound sense of the term implies:--    \"You all know my worthy friend Ferdinand, a very _helluo librorum_.  It was on a warm evening in summer, about an hour after sunset, that  Ferdinand made his way towards a small inn or rather village alehouse  that stood on a gentle eminence skirted by a luxuriant wood. He  entered, oppressed with heat and fatigued, but observed, on walking up  to the porch 'smothered with honeysuckles,' as I think Cowper  expresses it, that everything around bore the character of neatness  and simplicity. The hollyhocks were tall and finely variegated in  blossom, the pinks were carefully tied up, and roses of all colours  and fragrance stood around in a compacted form like a body-guard  forbidding the rude foot of trespasser to intrude. Within, Ferdinand  found corresponding simplicity and comfort.    \"The 'gude man' of the house was spending the evening with a  neighbour, but poached eggs and a rasher of bacon, accompanied with a  flagon of sparkling ale, gave our guest no occasion to doubt the  hospitality of the house on account of the absence of its master. A  little past ten, after reading some dozen pages in a volume of Sir  Edgerton Brydges's _Censura Literaria_, which he happened to carry  about him, and partaking pretty largely of the aforesaid eggs and ale,  Ferdinand called for his candle and retired to repose. His bedroom was  small but neat and airy; at one end and almost facing the window there  was a pretty large closet with the door open; but Ferdinand was too  fatigued to indulge any curiosity about what it might contain.    \"He extinguished his candle and sank upon his bed to rest. The heat  of the evening seemed to increase. He became restless, and throwing  off his quilt and drawing his curtain aside, turned towards the window  to inhale the last breeze which yet might be wafted from the  neighbouring heath. But no zephyr was stirring. On a sudden a broad  white flash of lightning--nothing more than summer heat--made our  bibliomaniac lay his head upon his pillow and turn his eyes in an  opposite direction. The lightning increased; and one flash more vivid  than the rest illuminated the interior of the closet and made manifest  an old mahogany book-case stored with books. Up started Ferdinand and  put his phosphoric treasures into action. He lit his match and trimmed  his candle and rushed into the closet, no longer mindful of the  heavens, which now were in a blaze with the summer heat.    \"The book-case was guarded both with glass and brass wires; and the  key--nowhere to be found! Hapless man! for to his astonishment he saw  _Morte d'Arthur_, printed by Caxton--_Richard Coeur de Lion_, by W. de  Worde--_The Widow Edyth_, by Pynson--and, towering above the rest, a  large-paper copy of the original edition of _Prince's Worthies of  Devon_, while lying transversely at the top reposed John Weever's  _Epigrams_!    \"'The spirit of Captain Cox is here revived,' exclaimed Ferdinand;  while on looking above he saw a curious set of old plays with _Dido,  Queen of Carthage_, at the head of them! What should he do? No key! No  chance of handling such precious tomes till the morning light with the  landlord returned!    \"He moved backwards and forwards with a hurried step, prepared his  pocketknife to cut out the panes of glass and untwist the brazen  wires; but a 'prick of conscience' made him desist from carrying his  wicked design into execution. Ferdinand then advanced towards the  window, and, throwing it open and listening to the rich notes of a  concert of nightingales, forgot the cause of his torments--his  situation reminded him of _The Churl and the Bird_--he rushed with  renewed madness into the cupboard, then searched for the bell, but  finding none, he made all sorts of strange noises. The landlady rose,  and, conceiving robbers to have broken into the stranger's room, came  and demanded the cause of the disturbance.    \"'Madam,' said Ferdinand, 'is there no possibility of inspecting the  books in the cupboard? Where is the key?'    \"'Alack, sir,' rejoined the landlady, 'what is there that thus  disturbs you in the sight of those books? Let me shut the closet-door  and take away the key of it, and you will then sleep in peace.'    \"'Sleep in peace!' resumed Ferdinand; 'Sleep in wretchedness, you  mean! I can have no peace unless you indulge me with the key of the  book-case. To whom do such gems belong?'    \"'Sir, they are not stolen goods!'    \"'Madam, I ask pardon. I did not mean to question their being honest  property, but'--    \"'Sir, they are not mine or my husband's.'    \"'Who, madam, who is the lucky owner?'    \"'An elderly gentleman of the name of--sir, I am not at liberty to  mention his name, but they belong to an elderly gentleman.'    \"'Will he part with them? Where does he live? Can you introduce me to  him?'    \"The good woman soon answered all Ferdinand's rapid queries, but the  result was by no means satisfactory to him.    \"He learnt that these uncommonly scarce and precious volumes belonged  to an ancient gentleman whose name was studiously concealed, but who  was in the habit of coming once or twice a week, during the autumn, to  smoke his pipe and lounge over his books, sometimes making extracts  from them and sometimes making observations in the margin with a  pencil. Whenever a very curious passage occurred, he would take out a  small memorandum book and put on a pair of large tortoise-shell  spectacles with powerful magnifying glasses in order to insert this  passage with particular care and neatness. He usually concluded his  evening amusements by sleeping in the very bed in which Ferdinand had  been lying.    \"Such intelligence only sharpened the curiosity and increased the  restlessness of poor Ferdinand. He retired to his bibliomaniacal bed,  but not to repose. The morning sunbeams, which irradiated the bookcase  with complete effect, shone upon his pallid countenance and thoughtful  brow. He rose at five, walked in the meadows till seven, returned and  breakfasted, stole upstairs to take a farewell peep at his beloved  _Morte d'Arthur_, sighed 'three times and more,' paid his reckoning,  apologized for the night's adventure, told the landlady he would  shortly come and visit her again and try to pay his respects to the  anonymous old gentleman.    \"'Meanwhile,' said he, 'I will leave no bookseller's shop in the  neighbourhood unvisited till I gain intelligence of his name and  character.'    \"The landlady eyed him steadily, took a pinch of snuff with a  significant air, and returning with a smile of triumph to her kitchen,  thanked her stars that she had got rid of such a madman!\"    To return, however, to the subject more immediately in hand, it  will be observed that the present age is more prolific of bibliophiles  than any preceding one, and that the growing interest in collecting  fine books is attended by a relatively increasing demand for a higher  standard of excellency of manufacture. A few years ago, there were  only two or three publishers in this country who \"specialized\" in fine  editions, while at present there are no less than thirty publishing  houses, large and small, and as many more \"private presses\" engaged in  the production of beautiful books to appease the demands of  book-buyers. Many of these are well established and conducted upon  thoroughly honest business principles; some, unfortunately, are not.  The publication and sale of books--especially the so-called \"de luxe\"  editions--is, like some other branches of industry, beset with  numerous evils; so many sharp practices, indeed, having been resorted  to by a few conscienceless publishers, and by a certain class of  unscrupulous agents, that buyers have become wary, not to say weary,  of being made the victims of their deceptive inventions. It is indeed  lamentable that a few such pestiferous schemers should thus bring a  certain degree of reproach upon the entire publishing business. It is  a common practice among these _soi-disant_ publishers--many of whom  possess neither capital, credit, nor sense of honor--to buy some lot  of etchings or old prints from a junk-shop, or second-hand dealer, at  a trifling price, and thereupon work the same off on credulous  admirers of rare prints for possibly a thousand times their real  value. And it is a common practice for these insidious sharks further  to prey upon unsuspecting book-buyers by obtaining publications of  reputable houses and falsifying them by the insertion of spurious  titles calculated to delude the buyer into the belief that there are  \"only fifty copies issued.\" Many of them are ostracized book-salesmen  who have at some previous time enjoyed the confidence of their  employers, but have been ex-communicated by all honest publishers and  booksellers on account of dishonest proclivities. They are therefore  set adrift to prey upon the public, and are a constant menace to both  publishers and buyers. I shall pay my further respects to these  counterfeiters later on when I come to the subject of Book Clubs; in  the mean while, it need hardly be pointed out that reprehensible  methods of this kind are uniformly condemned among all respectable  publishers and book-dealers, and that buyers should cautiously  discriminate against those who practice them. It is not surprising  that even the honest publishers and dealers themselves are  occasionally made the scapegoats of these obnoxious parasites; but the  astute collector is rarely \"caught\" by their schemes; and after a  book-buyer has passed the primary or \"experience\" stages of  book-collecting, he (or she) is designated as a \"dead one,\" in the  common parlance of the underground trade here referred to. Fortunate,  indeed, are the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#4)"],[1," its greater  flexibility and richness, demands more assistance to the reader's eye,  or even to his understanding. For instance, to read aloud hexameters or  other long lines, some of which have the initial accent on the first  syllable and some later, is quite impossible without previous study  supplemented by a marking of the page. Yet a few printed accents would  make a false start impossible. Poetry will never require the elaborate  aid from the printer which he gives to music; but it seems clear that he  has not yet done for it all that he might or should.    It is surely not an extreme assumption that the first duty of the  printer is to the meaning of his author, and his second to esthetics;  but shall we not rather say that his duty is to meet both demands, not  by a compromise, but by a complete satisfaction of each? A difficult  requirement, surely, but one that we are confident the twentieth-century  printer will not permit his critics to pronounce impossible.          FAVORITE BOOK SIZES      In the following paper some account will be given of five book sizes  that have taken rank as favorites. It should excite no surprise that all  are small sizes. Nature's favorites are always small; her insect jewels  outnumber her vertebrates a millionfold; and book-loving human nature  takes the same delight in daintiness.    There is, to be sure, a general impression that the first centuries of  printing were given up to folios, the eighteenth century to quartos and  octavos, and that only the present period has been characterized by  twelvemos and sixteenmos. We think of the Gutenberg Bible, the Nuremberg  Chronicle, the mighty editions of the Fathers, the polyglot Bibles of  Paris, London, and Antwerp,--fairly to be called limp teachers'  Bibles,--the 1611 Bible, the Shakespeare folios; then of the quarto  editions of Addison, Pope, Walpole, and their contemporaries, and the  stately octavo editions of the same writers; and finally of the myriad  _infra_ that have swarmed from the press during the last century. But,  when we walk through a library that offers a representative collection  of books from the invention of printing to the present, we realize that  the bigness of the folios and quartos has deceived us as to their  relative number, all forms of literature being considered.    The parent of our present book form, the Roman codex, split from an  actual block of wood, had a surface hardly as large as the cover of a  Little Classic. The vellum Books of Hours were dainty volumes. Even in  the period between Gutenberg and Aldus, books of moderate size were not  uncommon, and continuously, from the days of the great Venetian  popularizer of literature to the present, the small books have far  outnumbered their heavy-armed allies. Common sense, indeed, would tell  us that this must be so, even if it had not inspired Dr. Johnson, its  eighteenth century exponent, to declare: \"Books that you may carry to  the fire, and hold readily in your hand, are the most useful after all.\"    Our account properly begins with Aldus. From 1494, the date of his first  productions, until 1501 he printed his books in folio and quarto. But in  the first year of the new century he began to use his famous cursive  type, now called italic. The fineness of the new type, as has been  suggested, called for a smaller size of book, which was also favored by  considerations of economy and convenience; and so Aldus made up his  sheets in a form which the fold compels us to call octavo, but which  to-day would be called sixteenmo. Says Horatio F. Brown, in his \"The  Venetian Printing Press\": \"The public welcomed the new type and size.  The College granted Aldus a monopoly for ten years for all books printed  in this manner. The price of books was lowered at once. Didot calculates  that an octavo of Aldus cost, on an average, two francs and a half,  whereas a folio probably cost about twenty francs. These two innovations  on type and on format constituted a veritable revolution in the printing  press and in the book trade, which now began to reach a far more  extensive market than it had ever touched before. With this wide  diffusion of books came the popularization of knowledge at which Aldus  aimed. Scholarship began to lose its exclusive and aristocratic  character when the classics were placed within the reach of any student  who chose to study, meditate, and interpret them for himself. And to  Aldus belongs the credit of having, through his new type and size,  opened the way to the democratization of learning.\"    That the taste which Aldus so successfully hit was no merely temporary  one, any person will be convinced if he will stand before a shelf full  of these little Aldus classics, handle the light, well-proportioned  volumes, and take in the esthetic charm of their type and page and form,  which, in spite of their four hundred years, by no means savors of  antiquity. In these books Aldus achieved one of the greatest triumphs  possible in any art, a union of beauty and utility, each on so high a  plane that no one is able to decide which is pre-eminent. In a copy  which I have before me of his \"Rhetoricorum ad C. Herennium Libri IIII,\"  1546, the fine proportions of the page appear in spite of trimming. Very  noticeable are the undersized roman capitals; more curious is the letter  printed in the otherwise blank square to indicate what initial the  illuminator should insert in color, and the irregular use of capitals  and small letters after a period. The catchword appears only on the last  page of the signature, not on every page, as was the later practice.  Modern usage wisely consigns italic to a subordinate place, but in point  of beauty combined with convenience, it may well be questioned if four  centuries of printing have made any advance upon this page.    In nearly every library for scholars is to be found a row of plump  little books that never fail to catch the eye of the sightseer. If the  visitor does not know beforehand what they are, he is little enlightened  on being told that they are \"Elzevirs,\" and the attendant must needs  supply the information that the Elzevirs were a family of Dutch printers  who flourished during the century that closed with the arrival of  William III in England, and that these tiny volumes represent their most  popular productions. Says George Haven Putnam in his \"Books and their  Makers during the Middle Ages\": \"The Elzevirs, following the example set  a century and a half earlier by Aldus, but since that time very  generally lost sight of by the later publishers, initiated a number of  series of books in small and convenient forms, twelvemo and sixteenmo,  which were offered to book buyers at prices considerably lower than  those they had been in the habit of paying for similar material printed  in folio, quarto, or octavo.... These well-edited, carefully printed,  and low-priced editions of the classics won for the Elzevirs the cordial  appreciation of scholars and of students throughout Europe.\"    Among the authors who acknowledged their indebtedness to the Elzevirs  may be mentioned Galileo, the elder Balzac, and the poet Menage. I have  before me more than six feet of shelving filled with these tiny books.  They are nearly all bound in vellum, and thus retain their antique  appearance without as well as within. Their subject-matter is in the  fields of literature, ancient and contemporary, and the history,  geography, and political constitution of the principal countries. The  books of the latter division are known as \"Respublicae Variae.\" It is  impossible to resist the conclusion that this book form was chosen not  more to supply cheap books which could be sold to impecunious scholars  than to provide portable volumes for travelers. The Elzevir  \"Commonwealths\" were the predecessors of our \"satchel guides,\" and the  literary publications in this form were evidently designed to be pocket  editions. It was to such books that Dr. Johnson referred when he advised  his friends \"never to go out without some little book or other in their  pocket. Much time is lost by waiting, by travelling, etc., and this may  be prevented by making use of every possible opportunity for  improvement.\" When the positive doctor, on his journey to the Hebrides,  paid his tribute to George Buchanan at St. Andrews, his acquaintance  with the Latin poetry of the Scotch professor may well have arisen from  his having thus made a pocket piece of one of the several Elzevir  editions of the poet.    The characteristics of the \"Elzevirs\" are that they range from about  four to about five inches in height, are always narrow, 2-1/4 to 2-3/4  inches in width, and are usually thick, in some cases even 1-1/2 inches.  It is hardly necessary to say that the esthetic impression of these  \"jewels of typography\" is wholly different from that produced by the  \"Alduses.\" It is the beauty of an infant compared with that of a youth,  and, as in the case of the infant, plumpness is a part of the charm. The  thinnest of the \"Elzevirs\" (about three-fourths of an inch thick) lack  much of the characteristic quality. It is of course granted that no  small portion of the charm exerted by these volumes is due to their  type, which in artistic excellence and practical effectiveness has  hardly been surpassed before or since.    When William Pickering, in 1830, began to issue his Aldine edition of  the British Poets in the most beautiful and appropriate form that he  could devise, the design which he placed upon the title-page, a dolphin  and an anchor, with the words \"Aldi discip. Anglus,\" was an expression  at once of pride and of obligation. He had gone back to Aldus for his  model, and the book which he produced was in all but its change of type  from italic to roman a nearly exact reproduction of the form which Aldus  had employed so successfully three centuries before. Even the relative  thinness of the volumes was"]]]
