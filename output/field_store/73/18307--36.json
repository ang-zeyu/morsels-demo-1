He came near enough to get a glimpse of  the cage, and there read a placard which announced that \"The blue  ribbon and gold medal of the Knickerbocker High Society Cat and Pet  Show\" had been awarded to the \"thoroughbred, pedigreed Royal Analostan,  imported and exhibited by J. Malee, Esq., the well-known fancier. (Not  for sale.)\" Jap caught his breath and stared again. Yes, surely; there,  high in a gilded cage, on velvet cushions, with four policemen for  guards, her fur bright black and pale gray, her bluish eyes slightly  closed, was his Slum Kitty, looking the picture of a Cat bored to death  with a lot of fuss that she likes as little as she understands it.      VII    Jap Malee lingered around that cage, taking in the remarks, for  hours--drinking a draught of glory such as he had never known in life  before and rarely glimpsed in his dreams. But he saw that it would be  wise for him to remain unknown; his \"butler\" must do all the business.    It was Slum Kitty who made that show a success. Each day her value went  up in her owner's eyes. He did not know what prices had been given for  Cats, and thought that he was touching a record pitch when his \"butler\"  gave the director authority to sell the Analostan for one hundred  dollars.    This is how it came about that the Slum Cat found herself transferred  from the show to a Fifth Avenue mansion. She evinced a most  unaccountable wildness at first. Her objection to petting, however, was  explained on the ground of her aristocratic dislike of familiarity. Her  retreat from the Lap-dog onto the centre of the dinner-table was  understood to express a deep-rooted though mistaken idea of avoiding a  defiling touch. Her assaults on a pet Canary were condoned for the  reason that in her native Orient she had been used to despotic example.  The patrician way in which she would get the cover off a milk-can was  especially applauded. Her dislike of her silk-lined basket, and her  frequent dashes against the plate-glass windows, were easily  understood: the basket was too plain, and plate-glass was not used in  her royal home. Her spotting of the carpet evidenced her Eastern modes  of thought. The failure of her several attempts to catch Sparrows in  the high-walled back yard was new proof of the royal impotency of her  bringing up; while her frequent wallowings in the garbage-can were  understood to be the manifestation of a little pardonable high-born  eccentricity. She was fed and pampered, shown and praised; but she was  not happy. Kitty was homesick! She clawed at that blue ribbon round her  neck till she got it off; she jumped against the plate-glass because  that seemed the road to outside; she avoided people and Dogs because  they had always proved hostile and cruel; and she would sit and gaze on  the roofs and back yards at the other side of the window, wishing she  could be among them for a change.    But she was strictly watched, was never allowed outside--so that all  the happy garbage-can moments occurred while these receptacles of joy  were indoors. One night in March, however, as they were set out a-row  for the early scavenger, the Royal Analostan saw her chance, slipped  out of the door, and was lost to view.    Of course there was a grand stir; but Pussy neither knew nor cared  anything about that--her one thought was to go home. It may have been  chance that took her back in the direction of Gramercy Grange Hill, but  she did arrive there after sundry small adventures. And now what? She  was not at home, and she had cut off her living. She was beginning to  be hungry, and yet she had a peculiar sense of happiness. She cowered  in a front garden for some time. A raw east wind had been rising, and  now it came to her with a particularly friendly message; man would have  called it an unpleasant smell of the docks, but to Pussy it was welcome  tidings from home. She trotted down the long Street due east, threading  the rails of front gardens, stopping like a statue for an instant, or  crossing the street in search of the darkest side, and came at length  to the docks and to the water. But the place was strange. She could go  north or south. Something turned her southward; and, dodging among  docks and Dogs, carts and Cats, crooked arms of the bay and straight  board fences, she got, in an hour or two, among familiar scenes and  smells; and, before the sun came up, she had crawled back--weary and  foot-sore through the same old hole in the same old fence and over a  wall to her junk-yard back of the bird-cellar--yes, back into the very  cracker-box where she was born.    Oh, if the Fifth Avenue family could only have seen her in her native  Orient!    After a long rest she came quietly down from the cracker-box toward the  steps leading to the cellar, engaged in her old-time pursuit of seeking  for eatables. The door opened, and there stood the negro. He shouted to  the bird-man inside:    \"Say, boss, come hyar. Ef dere ain't dat dar Royal Ankalostan am comed  back!\"    Jap came in time to see the Cat jumping the wall. They called loudly  and in the most seductive, wheedling tones: \"Pussy, Pussy, poor Pussy!  Come, Pussy!\" But Pussy was not prepossessed in their favor, and  disappeared to forage in her old-time haunts.    The Royal Analostan had been a windfall for Jap--had been the means of  adding many comforts to the cellar and several prisoners to the cages.  It was now of the utmost importance to recapture her majesty. Stale  meat-offal and other infallible lures were put out till Pussy, urged by  the reestablished hunger-pinch, crept up to a large fish-head in a  box-trap; the negro, in watching, pulled the string that dropped the  lid, and, a minute later, the Analostan was once more among the  prisoners in the cellar. Meanwhile Jap had been watching the 'Lost and  Found' column. There it was, \"$25 reward,\" etc. That night Mr. Malee's  butler called at the Fifth Avenue mansion with the missing cat. \"Mr.  Malee's compliments, sah. De Royal Analostan had recurred in her recent  proprietor's vicinity and residence, sah. Mr. Malee had pleasure in  recuperating the Royal Analostan, sah.\" Of course Mr. Malee could not  be rewarded, but the butler was open to any offer, and plainly showed  that he expected the promised reward and something more.    Kitty was guarded very carefully after that; but so far from being  disgusted with the old life of starving, and glad of her ease, she  became wilder and more dissatisfied.      VIII    The spring was doing its New York best. The dirty little English  Sparrows were tumbling over each other in their gutter brawls, Cats  yowled all night in the areas, and the Fifth Avenue family were  thinking of their country residence. They packed up, closed house and  moved off to their summer home, some fifty miles away, and Pussy, in a  basket, went with them.    \"Just what she needed: a change of air and scene to wean her away from  her former owners and make her happy.\"    The basket was lifted into a Rumble-shaker. New sounds and passing  smells were entered and left. A turn in the course was made. Then a  roaring of many feet, more swinging of the basket; a short pause,  another change of direction, then some clicks, some bangs, a long  shrill whistle, and door-bells of a very big front door; a rumbling, a  whizzing, an unpleasant smell, a hideous smell, a growing horrible,  hateful choking smell, a deadly, griping, poisonous stench, with  roaring that drowned poor Kitty's yowls, and just as it neared the  point where endurance ceased, there was relief. She heard clicks and  clacks. There was light; there was air. Then a man's voice called, \"All  out for 125th Street,\" though of course to Kitty it was a mere human  bellow. The roaring almost ceased--did cease. Later the rackety-bang  was renewed with plenty of sounds and shakes, though not the poisonous  gas; a long, hollow, booming roar with a pleasant dock smell was  quickly passed, and then there was a succession of jolts, roars, jars,  stops, clicks, clacks, smells, jumps, shakes, more smells, more  shakes,--big shakes, little shakes,--gases, smokes, screeches,  door-bells, tremblings, roars, thunders, and some new smells, raps,  taps, heavings, rumblings, and more smells, but all without any of the  feel that the direction is changed. When at last it stopped, the sun  came twinkling through the basket-lid. The Royal Cat was lifted into a  Rumble-shaker of the old familiar style, and, swerving aside from their  past course, very soon the noises of its wheels were grittings and  rattlings; a new and horrible sound was added--the barking of Dogs, big  and little and dreadfully close. The basket was lifted, and Slum Kitty  had reached her country home.    Every one was officiously kind. They wanted to please the Royal Cat,  but somehow none of them did, except, possibly, the big, fat cook that  Kitty discovered on wandering into the kitchen. This unctuous person  smelt more like a slum than anything she had met for months, and the  Royal Analostan was proportionately attracted. The cook, when she  learned that fears were entertained about the Cat staying, said:  \"Shure, she'd 'tind to thot; wanst a Cat licks her futs, shure she's at  home.\" So she deftly caught the unapproachable royalty in her apron,  and committed the horrible sacrilege of greasing the soles of her feet  with pot-grease. Of course Kitty resented it--she resented everything  in the place; but on being set down she began to dress her paws and  found evident satisfaction in that grease. She licked all four feet for  an hour, and the cook triumphantly announced that now \"shure she'd be  apt to shtay.\" And stay she did, but she showed a most surprising and  disgusting preference for the kitchen, the cook, and the garbage-pail.    The family, though distressed by these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22849"],[0,"The History of Tasmania , Volume II (#4)"],[1,"name. These  provocations produced their usual consequences: by spearing cattle, and  other acts of hostility, a tribe at the Coal River revenged the robbery  of their children; surely, a slight retaliation for such incredible  wickedness.    An expedition to Macquarie Harbour, in 1817, discovered a tribe hitherto  unknown. They received the first visit with the usual friendliness--a  feeling which was, however, of short duration.    The Oyster Bay tribe are mentioned. They had begun to exhibit that  spirit of hostility which made them a terror to the colony, and armed  the entire community against them. They had speared one man, and killed  another; but the origin of this feeling is distinctly stated: a native  had been shot in an expedition to capture some aboriginal children.    Sorell prolongs the testimony that tells so mournfully in behalf of the  natives. He speaks of firing on the blacks as a _habit_; that  child-stealing was practised in the remoter districts; that settlers had  adopted groundless prejudices against the unfortunate people, as alike  incapable and unworthy of conciliation; that they offered no serious  discountenance to the cruelty of their servants. Thus several whites had  perished, and cattle had been speared, in revenge.[5] He reminded the  colonists that, as their flocks increased and the shepherds extended  their range, this obvious method of retaliation, then rarely adopted,  would multiply the loss both of property and human life. The danger was  proved by examples:--In 1819, a collision occurred; a man on each side  killed, and cattle and sheep were speared; but, the account continues,  the stock-keepers detained and maltreated the wife of a chief. Either on  this, or some such occasion, they were pursued by a party of the 48th  regiment, and seventeen were slain. He maintains very strenuously the  opinion of his predecessors, that the aborigines were not often the  aggressors, and that the injuries they inflicted were committed under  the impulse of recent provocation.    Sorell provided for the native children, except those committed to  private hands by their parents, or retained with the express sanction  of himself. There is no reason to doubt, that several of these were  orphans, and adopted and reared with the utmost humanity. Among the  expenses of the times, it is gratifying to observe one item, in the  rental of a house for the entertainment of the aborigines. The  sentiments of Governor Sorell are honorable to his character, and cannot  be doubted; but we are startled to find, that when charges, so solemnly  imputed, must have been founded upon particular facts, no equal  punishment seems to have overtaken the crimes proclaimed. The government  disapproved of oppression, but it was either too weak, or too indolent,  to visit the guilty.    Mr. Commissioner Bigge, who came to the colony 1820, in his voluminous  reports, rarely alludes to the natives of these seas. Those of Van  Diemen's Land engaged a very small share of his attention, and in two  brief paragraphs he describes their character, and disposes of their  claims. He remarks, that an act of unjustifiable hostility had awakened  their resentment, passes over an interval of sixteen years, and  expresses his conviction that no obstacle they could oppose to  colonisation, need excite alarm. It is probable, that his instructions  would but briefly touch on questions relating to these children of the  soil; but considering that the notices and orders of government must  have apprised him of their sufferings, he dismisses their case with  astonishing indifference.[6]    Several Wesleyan missionaries visited this island during the years 1821  and 1822. The natives attracted their notice: they described, with  brevity, their moral and social state; but they did not intimate the  smallest apprehension of their malice.    For several years reference to the aborigines is of rare occurrence. The  year preceding the first series of outrages, furnished no incident worth  contemporary record. We are reminded, however, that they survived, by an  act of equestrian audacity. Mr. Risely, looking down Allan Vale, saw a  naked girl dashing off at full speed, on a valuable horse, which she  bridled by the tether--the first of her race ever known to gallop.  Horsemen pursued her for two days, without overtaking her.    In those numerous publications, which precede 1824, the  aborigines are always represented as originally friendly, and only  dangerous when excited by cruelty. It was the boast of the times, that  the whole island could be crossed in safety by two persons armed with  muskets; and Curr, who wrote latest, does not even mention their  existence. It is difficult to imagine more decided proof, that at this  time the depredations of the blacks were neither numerous nor  sanguinary.    It is the general opinion, however, that the remonstrances of Sorell had  been attended with some success, and that the settlers and stock-keepers  were not unimpressed with his predictions of a more concerted and  continuous revenge; nor can we doubt that many persons of humanity even  exaggerated this peril, to restrain those brutal natures which are  sensible only of personal risk.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 3: \"The natives, who have been rendered desperate by the  cruelties they have experienced from our people, have now begun to  distress us by attacking our cattle. Two were lately wounded by them at  Collins-vale; and three, it is reported, belonging to George Guest, have  been killed at Blackman's Bay. As this tribe of natives have hitherto  been considered friendly, the change in their conduct must be occasioned  by some outrage on our part, No account having been received up to this  time of William Russell and George Getley, there can be no doubt of the  miserable death they have been put to. This unfortunate man, Russell, is  a striking instance of divine agency, which has overtaken him at last,  and punished him by the hands of those very people who have suffered so  much from him; he being well known to have exercised his barbarous  disposition in murdering or torturing any who unfortunately came within  his reach.\"--_The Derwent Star, January 29th, 1810._]    [Footnote 4: Eye-witness.]    [Footnote 5: \"ORDER.--From the conduct of the native people, when free  from any feeling of injury towards those who have held intercourse with  them, there is strong reason to hope, that they might be conciliated. On  the north-eastern coast, where boats occasionally touch, and at  Macquarie Harbour, where the natives have been lately seen, they have  been found inoffensive and peaceable, _and they are known to be equally  inoffensive, where the stock-keepers treat them with mildness_.\"--March  19, 1819.]    [Footnote 6: Dual, mentioned by Bigge, was transported from Sydney, for  chopping off the right arm of his wife: he said she should \"make no more  _dough-boy_.\" The whites persuaded the natives, that the lighter hue of  their half-caste children resulted from the too free use of flour.]        SECTION III.    It would be useful to mankind, to trace the causes which led to that  long and disastrous conflict, in which so many lives were sacrificed,  and a people, all but a fading fragment, became extinct. Among those  mentioned by the government, was the admission into the colony of Sydney  blacks, and the ascendancy which one of them acquired.    The emigrants of 1822 remember a number of natives, who roamed about the  district, and were known as the \"tame mob;\" they were absconders from  different tribes, and separated from their chiefs. They often entered  the town and obtained bread, tobacco, and even rum from the inhabitants.  Their importunity was troublesome, and their appearance offensive: the  eruptive disease which covered their skin, especially on the legs, most  exposed to the heat of their fires, added to their squalor and  wretchedness. They are thus described by the Rev. Mr. Horton: he saw  them at Pittwater, crouching round their fires, and entirely naked--a  company of demoralised savages.    Musquito became their head. He was transported from Sydney to this  colony for the murder of a woman. For some time he acted as a  stock-keeper; he was then employed as a guide, in tracking the  bushrangers, having the keenness of vision, and almost canine instinct,  by which in the slightest traces he discovered a certain clue. For this  service, it is said, he was promised restoration to his country--a  promise, unhappily, forgotten. He was odious to the prisoners, who  taunted him as a _nose_ for the hangman; his resentful nature could not  brook the insult, and he struck down a convict who thus reviled him. He  was then taken into custody; in alarm, he escaped to the bush. The  muscular strength and superior skill of this man were supposed to have  recommended him to the natives as their chief. He was seen, by  Robertson, to cut off the head of a pigeon with a stick, while flying.  Musquito answered Mr. Horton with intelligence, when that gentleman  represented the misery of a vagrant life; he said that he should prefer  to live like the white man, tilling the ground, but that none of his  companions would join him. Before he united with the natives, he was  accustomed to pursue them with all the virulence of a savage. In company  with a convict servant he would face the darkness, and go out \"to storm  the huts\" he had seen in the day. On one such occasion, in spite of  prohibitions, he set out at night; but the natives had observed him, and  decamped, leaving behind them large fires to deceive their enemy.  Returning at midnight, he was mistaken for a Tasmanian black; and, but  for discovery at the moment, would have suffered the fate he deserved.    It was said by Mr. G. Robertson, that the first murders of Musquito were  committed in self defence. He associated with the Oyster Bay tribe, and  his power over them was great:"]]]
