I am speaking very seriously now.  I mean, do not let Master Pawson think that you ridicule his love of  music.  It would be very weak and foolish, and lower you in his eyes.\"    \"Oh, I'll mind, mother.\"    \"Recollect that he is a scholar and a gentleman, and in your father's  confidence.\"    Roy nodded, and his lips parted as if to speak, but he closed them  again.    \"What were you going to say, Roy?\"    \"Oh, nothing, mother.\"    \"Nothing?\"    \"Well, only--that--I was going to say, do you like Master Pawson?\"    \"As your tutor and your father's secretary, yes.  He is a very clever  man, I know.\"    \"Yes, he's a very clever man,\" said Roy, as, after kissing his mother  affectionately, he went off towards the west tower, which had been  specially fitted up as study and bedchamber for the gentleman who had  come straight from Oxford to reside at Sir Granby Royland's seat a  couple of years before this time.  \"Yes, he's a very clever man,\" said  Roy to himself; \"but I thought I shouldn't like him the first day he  came, and I've gone on thinking so ever since.  I don't know why, but--  Oh, yes, I do,\" cried the boy, screwing up his face with a look of  disgust: \"it's because, as he says, I've no soul for music.\"    For just at that moment a peculiar long-drawn wailing sound came from  the open window of the west tower, and a dog lying curled up on the  grass in the sun sprang up and began to bark, finishing off with a long,  low howl, as it stretched out its neck towards the open window.    \"Poor old Nibbs! he has no soul for it, either,\" said the boy to  himself, as his face lit up with a mirthful expression.  \"It woke him  up, and he thought it was cats.  Wonder what tune that is?  He won't  want me to interrupt him now.  Better see, though, and speak to him  first, and then I'll go and see old Ben polish the armour.\"        CHAPTER THREE.    COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.    The wail on one string went on, and naturally sounded louder as Roy  Royland opened a door to stand gazing in at the quaint octagonal room,  lit by windows splayed to admit more light to the snug quarters hung  with old tapestry, and made cosy with thick carpet and easy-chair, and  intellectual with dwarf book-cases filled with choice works.  These had  overflowed upon the floor, others being piled upon the tops of chairs  and stacked in corners wherever room could be found, while some were  even ranged upon the narrow steps of the corkscrew stone staircase which  led to the floor above, occupied by Master Palgrave Pawson for a  bedchamber, the staircase being continued up to the leads, where it  ended in a tiny turret.    \"I wonder what father will say, my fine fellow, when he finds what a lot  of his books you've brought up out of the library,\" said Roy to himself,  as he stood watching the plump, smooth-faced youngish man, who, with an  oblong music-book open before him on the table, was seated upon a stool,  with a 'cello between his legs, gravely sawing away at the strings, and  frowning severely whenever, through bad stopping with his fingers--and  that was pretty often--he produced notes \"out of tune and harsh.\"  The  musician was dressed, according to the fashion of the day, in dark  velvet with a lace collar, and wore his hair long, so that it  inconvenienced him; the oily curls, hanging down on either side of his  fat face like the valance over an old-fashioned four-post bedstead,  swaying to and fro with the motion of the man's body, and needing, from  time to time, a vigorous shake to force them back when they encroached  too far forward and interfered with his view of the music.    The slow, solemn, dirge-like air went on, but the player did not turn  his head, playing away with grave importance, and giving himself a  gentle inclination now and then to make up for the sharp twitches caused  by the tickling hair.    \"You saw me,\" said Roy, speaking to himself, but at the musician, \"for  one of your eyes turned this way; but you won't speak till you've got to  the end of that bit of noise.  Oh, how I should like to shear off those  long greasy curls!  They make you look worse even than you do when  they're all twisted up in pieces of paper.  It doesn't suit your round,  fat face.  You don't look a bit like a cavalier, Master P.P.; but I  suppose you're a very good sort of fellow, or else father would not have  had you here.\"    Just then the music ended with an awkwardly performed run up an octave  and four scrapes across the first and second strings.    \"Come in, boy,\" said the player, taking up a piece of resin to apply to  the hair of the bow, \"and shut the door.\"    He spoke in a highly-pitched girlish voice, which somehow always tickled  Roy and made him inclined to laugh, and the desire increased upon this  occasion as he said, solemnly--    \"Saraband.\"    \"Oh!  Who's she?\" said the boy, wonderingly.    The secretary threw his head back, shaking his curls over his broad  turn-down collar, and smiled pityingly.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"now this is another proof of your folly, Roy, in  preferring the society of the servants to that of the noble works with  which your father has stored his library.  What ignorance!  A saraband  is a piece of dance music, Italian in origin; and that was a very  beautiful composition.\"    \"Dance?\" cried the boy.  \"People couldn't dance to a tune like that.  I  thought it was an old dirge.\"    \"Want of taste and appreciation, boy.  But I see you would prefer  something light and sparkling.  I will--sit down--play you a coranto.\"    It was on Roy's lips to say, \"Oh, please don't,\" but he contented  himself with crossing the room, lifting some books off an oaken  window-seat, his tutor watching him keenly the while, and putting them  on the floor; while, with his head still thrown back on one side, Master  Palgrave Pawson slowly turned over the leaves of his music-book with the  point of his bow.    Roy seated himself, with a sigh, after a glance down through the open  window at the glistening moat dotted with the great silver blossoms and  dark flat leaves of the water-lilies, seeing even from there the shadowy  forms of the great fish which glided slowly among the slimy stalks.    \"Ready?\" said the musician, giving his hand a flourish.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Roy, aloud; and then to himself, \"Oh, what an awful  fib.\"  Then he wrinkled up his brows dismally, and began to think of old  Ben polishing the armour and swords; but the next moment his face  smoothed out stiffly, and he grew red in his efforts to keep from  laughing aloud, for Master Pawson commenced jerking and snatching from  the strings a remarkable series of notes, which followed one another in  a jigging kind of fairly rapid sequence, running up and down the gamut  and in and out, as if the notes of the composer had suddenly become  animated, and, like some kind of tiny, big-headed, long-tailed goblins,  were chasing one another in and out of the five lines of the stave,  leaping from bar to bar, never stopping for a rest, making fun of the  flats and sharps, and finally pausing, breathless and tired, as the  player now finally laid down the bow, took out a fine laced  handkerchief, and began to wipe his fingers and mop his brow.    \"There,\" he said, smiling; \"you like that bright, sparkling composition  better?\"    \"No,\" said Roy, decisively; \"no, I don't think I do.\"    \"I am glad of it; very glad of it.  I was afraid that you preferred the  light and trivial coranto to the graceful saraband.\"    \"But, I say.  Master Pawson, the Italians surely don't dance to such  music as that?\"    \"I have never been in Italy, my dear pupil, but I believe they do.  Going?\"    Roy had risen from his chair.    \"Yes, sir; I thought, as you were practising, you would not want me to  stop and read to-day, and you are writing a letter, too.\"    \"Letter?\" said the secretary, hurriedly reaching towards an open sheet  upon the table and turning it over with the point of his bow.  \"Oh,  that?  Yes, some notes--some notes.  Well, it is a fine day, and  exercise is good, and perhaps I shall run through a few more  compositions.  So you can go, and we will study a little in the evening,  for we must not neglect our work, Roy, my dear pupil; we must not  neglect our work.\"    \"No, sir.  Thank you, sir,\" said the boy; and, for fear of a change of  decision, he hurried from the room and made his way out upon the old  ramparts, to begin walking leisurely round the enclosed garden, and  looking outward from the eminence upon which the castle was built across  the moat at the foot, and away over the sunny forest towards the village  and little church, whose spire rose about two miles away.    \"I wish he wouldn't always call me `my dear pupil,' and smile at me as  if he looked down from ever so high up.  I don't know how it is, but I  always feel as if I don't like him.  I suppose it's because he's so  plump and smooth.    \"Seems hard,\" mused the boy, seating himself in one of the crenellations  of the rampart, and thinking deeply, \"that he should get letters with  news from London, and poor mother not have a line.  That was a letter on  the table, though he pretended it was not, for I could see it began like "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25452"],[0,"The Kangaroo Marines (#4)"],[1,"is the work of a few who have cast off their native  garments, donned the clothes of the Westerner, and acquired a  smattering of things.  A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  These  young _effendis_ are the fools who would step where angels fear to  tread.  These malcontents spurred and led Arabi Pasha (a true patriot)  to his doom.  The self-same type have recently sent a Khedive into  shame and exile.  These so-called \"Nationalists\" were the willing tools  of German and Austrian agents who aimed at capturing Egypt and  dominating the route to India.  Before the war there was a German spy  in every town from Alexandria to Khartoum.  These spies even supped at  the table of the late Khedive.  While they went their way they smiled  and called us fools.  Eagerly they lived for the day when Enver Pasha  (the well-paid Moslem adventurer) would lead his deluded Turks against  the British host.    The great dream of the Khedive, his Nationalists and German agents  failed because of the courage and shrewdness of \"K\" and his men.  While  the world waited for the Holy War and the fall of Egypt, the great  Australian host was quietly landing on Egypt's shores.  In this army  were such men as the Kangaroo Marines--fearless, tireless, and ready  for adventure.  The tramp, tramp of their feet made traitors shiver and  flee; their physique, their chins, their corded arms spread over the  Delta and the desert a sense of might and courage.    \"There can be no rebellion.  The Australians are too big, too strong.  Allah is against us,\" said the wise men in the little hamlets by the  Nile.    \"These are white men--not black,\" muttered an _effendi_ to his friend,  as the Australians marched through intriguing Cairo.  Like many  Egyptians, he had imagined Australians to be of a nigger mould.    \"Yes, infidels and sons of dogs,\" growled a priestly fanatic.    \"What men--what guns--Allah preserve us!\" said many more who had talked  revolution for a while.  This, truly, was a bloodless climax to the  schemes of Germany, Turkey, and the Khedive.    Along the sun-baked road to Mena marched the Australians.  They were  treading a road made by a great Khedive for the Empress Eugenie to see  the Pyramids in comfort.  When they halted they were beneath the shade  of the historic piles of stones.  Napoleon's soldiers had been there,  so had Gordon's and Kitchener's heroes.   Now these sons of the  Motherland found themselves at the beginning of another historic  mission.    \"There's been a lot of overtime on that job,\" said Bill Buster to his  pals when nearing the Pyramids.    \"Wha built them?\" inquired Sandy of Claud.    \"Rameses built one.\"    \"What for?\"    \"To keep his fellows from getting tired.\"    \"Sure now,\" said Paddy, \"there's a dog wid a woman's head.\"    \"That's a Sphinx,\" remarked Claud with a smile.    These ancient things and the general surroundings made all open their  eyes in wonder, and feel that there were more things on earth than  their own little cabbage patch.    They settled down quickly, and having received an enormous haul of cash  in the form of arrears of pay, the Kangaroo Marines and every other  corps set out on donkeys, motor-cars, cabs, camels and carts to see the  sights of Cairo.    \"Gee whiz! this is some town,\" said Bill, on reaching the gay and  dazzling city.  The wide streets, oriental buildings, the weird  bazaars, gaily-lit cafes, and veiled women, amazed these simple  Bushmen.  It was like \"The Arabian Nights,\" wonderful, alluring,  seductive and strange.  All were gripped by the subtle atmosphere of  things.  Their blood tingled with the sensuous aroma of the East.  Cheap wine in the cafes of the Greeks let the devil loose, and so they  fell an easy prey to the lures of the bold and handsome wantons of  Cairo.  Thus many were duped and robbed.    Australians when wronged must have revenge.  An eye for an eye is the  law of the bush.  The revenge came in an unexpected way.  In one of the  streets where the wantons live an injustice had been done to one of the  boys.  The exact reason was never told.  But Cairo was soon alarmed by  the shrieks of women, the shouts of fire, and the galloping of mounted  police.  Through the glare and smoke could be seen a little army of men  wreaking revenge.  Windows were being smashed, a piano was crashed from  above to the ground, doors were torn down, crockery clattered into the  street.    \"Allah!  Allah!  Save us, save us!  The mad Australians!  The mad  Australians!\" cried the cowardly _effendis_ as they fled.    \"Help!  Help!\" screamed the wantons, as they ran like maddened hares.  But the wrecking went on, despite the charging pickets and hoarse  commands from officers and police.    \"Here's the fire brigade, boys, capture them,\" yelled a great hulking  fellow.  And they did.  With a wild haloo, they captured the engines,  cut the pipes, and terrified the poor gippy firemen out of their lives.  It was an ugly time.  And the riot was only quelled by armed pickets  sent from other corps.    \"It's a great pity we interfered at all,\" said a Cairo dignitary that  night.    \"Why?\" inquired his friend.    \"They would have burned the whole dirty place down, and that would have  been the greatest blessing to Cairo.\"    \"Then you don't blame them?\"    \"No.  I think Cairo has been cursed with the vilest creatures God ever  made.  Yes, I admit, the Capitulations have hitherto tied our hands.  Thank Heaven Egypt is now a Protectorate.  We can clean out these  filthy dens after the war.\"    \"Yes, it is a queer hole, but East is East, and West is West, and never  the twain shall meet,\" chipped in another member of the club.  \"It's a  wonder they didn't kill that fellow Hassein.\"    \"Who's he?\"    \"A rotter who dresses as a woman and runs a crowd of white slaves.  And, by Jove! he looks like a woman too--all scented and faked.\"    \"Oh, he's a law-abiding merchant of sin,\" said a gippy officer.  \"There's a worse person than he here.\"    \"Who's that?\"    \"Madame Mysterious, who owns dozens of these low shows in Cairo.\"    \"Isn't that the woman who used to buy and sell wives to the rich  _effendis_ and gippy _pashas_?\"    \"The same.  That old Pasha down near Alex is one of her patrons.  He's  a proper old rascal.  Do you know that he has got women in his harem  who have been educated in some of our greatest schools in England?\"    \"Not English women, surely?\"    \"No.  Gippy girls, daughters of rich fellows.\"    \"And why shouldn't he?\" interjected an old gippy warrior who defended  the customs of the East.  \"We have no right to force our Western morals  down an Oriental's throat.  It is easy to be a moralist in a freezing  climate like ours.  The snow makes for virtue; the sun always warps  morality.  The harem is as ancient as the sun.  And the harem will  remain.  It's no good of you fellows hoping to alter it.  And, after  all, the Oriental is, at least, honest.  He has a harem, the world  knows he has a harem.  He is not ashamed of the fact.  But what of our  Mayfair bloods, who have their secret 'wives,' and who hunt everybody  else's wife.  The Oriental is straight about it--we Westerners are  hypocritical.\"    \"I offer no defence of the harem,\" said a doctor, \"but I've found it a  mighty interesting place when visiting there in a professional  capacity.  Do you fellows know that I have met some of the most  intellectual women there.  Strange to say, they like the life.  And,  after all, they are well cared for.  They have money--heaps of  it--beautiful clothes, lovely rooms, servants, carriages, and motors.  They see everything, they do almost everything, and since the  revolution in Turkey they have had greater freedom.  Why, they travel  abroad now without their eunuchs.  What more does a woman want?  Money,  clothes and comfort are everything to an Easterner.  In my humble  opinion there is no virtue in an eastern climate.  There can never be.\"    \"We've got off the track altogether,\" said the father of this  discussion.  \"I am liberal-minded so far as the Egyptians are  concerned.  In their own way they are virtuous.  And I agree that it is  ridiculous to suggest that we should interfere with any of their social  or religious arrangements.  But this riot has again proved to us that  Cairo is a pretty rotten show.  We ought to clean it up, and we shall  do so after the war.  It will pay us.  Let us make Cairo a cleaner and  more charming place.  It means health and business to the community.  Why should Cairo be the cesspool of European iniquity?  Personally, as  I said before, I'm very sorry the Australians did not burn the whole of  that rotten quarter down.\"          CHAPTER IV    TREASURE TROVE    \"Look here, men,\" said Colonel Killem, \"I want to talk to you about  some interesting things, especially your conduct towards Mohammedans.  First of all, Doolan, tell me what a Mohammedan means?\"    \"Sure, sir, it manes a nigger who jabbers 'Allah' when yis put a  bayonet in his guts.\"    \"Not exactly; but what would you shout if you got a bayonet in your  tummy.\"    \"A gill of the best, sir.\"    \"Well, now, a Mohammedan's a sort of eastern fanatic who thinks he'll  get a 'corner lot' in Paradise if he reads the Koran and dies on the  edge of your bayonets.  Mecca is his holy shrine, and the old Sultan  acts as a sort of elder or high priest who takes up the collections.  We meet 'em ourselves--religious beggars who're always passing round  the hat for ninepence to make up another shilling.  Religion is always  an expensive business, except in Scotland, where you get free seats to  support the Kirk and Government.
