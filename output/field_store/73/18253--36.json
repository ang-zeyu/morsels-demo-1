So her husband met her, and they went  back together.          SACRED LEGEND    _Omaha_      In the beginning the people were in water. They opened their eyes, but  they could see nothing. As the people came out of the water, they  first saw the daylight. They had no clothing. Then they took weeds and  grasses and from them wove clothing.    The people lived near a large body of water; it was in a wooded  country where there was game. The men hunted the deer with clubs; they  did not know the use of the bow. The people wandered about the shores  of the great water. They were poor and cold. The people thought, \"What  shall we do to help ourselves?\" So they began chipping stones. They  found a bluish stone that was easily flaked and chipped; so they made  knives and arrowheads out of it. But they were still poor and cold.  They thought, \"What shall we do?\"    Then a man found an elm root that was very dry. He dug a hole in it  and put a stick in and rubbed it. Then smoke came. He smelled it. Then  the people smelled it and came near. Others helped him to rub. At last  a spark came. They blew this into a flame. Thus fire came to warm the  people and to cook their food.    After this the people built grass houses; they cut the grass with the  shoulder blade of a deer. Now the people had fire and ate their meat  roasted. Then they grew tired of roast meat. They thought, \"How shall  we cook our meat differently?\"    A man found a piece of clay that stuck well together. Then he brought  sand to mix with it. Then he molded it as a pot. Then he gathered  grass until he had a large heap of it; he put the clay pot into the  midst of the grass and set it on fire. This made the clay hard. After  a time he put water into the pot; the water did not leak out. This was  good. So he put water into it and then meat into it, and put the pot  over the fire. Thus the people had boiled meat to eat.    Now their grass coverings would grow fuzzy and drop off. It was hard  to gather and keep these coverings. The people were not satisfied.  Again they thought, \"What can we do to have something different to  wear?\"    Before this, they had been throwing away the hides from the game which  they killed. But now they took their stone knives to scrape down the  hides and make them thin. They rubbed the hides with grass and with  their hands to make them soft. Then they used the hides for clothing.  Now they had clothing and were warm.    Now the women had to break the dry wood to keep up the fires. They had  no tools. So the men made a stone ax with a groove. Then they put a  handle on the grooved stone and fastened it with rawhide. This was  used. Then they wanted something better to break the wood. So they  made wedges of stone.    Now the grass shelter came to pieces easily. Then the people thought,  \"What shall we do? How can we get something that will not come to  pieces?\" Then they tried putting skins on poles.    First they tried deerskins. But they were too small. They tried elk  skins. But they became hard and stiff in the rain and sun. Then they  did not try skins longer. They used bark to cover the poles of their  tepees.    But the bark houses were not warm. Then the people took the leg bone  of the deer and splintered it So they made sharp pieces for awls. Then  they took buffalo skins and sinews, and with the awl they fastened the  skins together. So they made comfortable covers for their tepees.    Then a man wandered around a long time. One day he found some small  pieces of something which were white, and red, and blue. He thought  they must be something of great value, so he hid them in a mound of  earth. Now one day he went to see if they were safe. Behold! When he  came to the mound, green stalks were growing out of it. And on the  stalks were small kernels of white, and red, and blue. Behold! It was  corn. Then the man took the corn, and gave it to the people. They  tried it for food. They found it good, and have ever since called it  their life.    Now when the people found the corn good, they thought to hide it in  mounds as the first man had done. So they took the shoulder blade of  an elk and made mounds. Then they hid the corn in it. So the corn grew  and the people had food.    Now as the people wandered around, they came to a forest where the  birch trees grew. There was a great lake there. Then they made canoes  of birch bark. They traveled in them on the water. Then a man found  two young animals. He carried them home. He fed them so they grew  bigger. Then he made a harness which he placed upon them and fastened  it to poles. So these animals became burden bearers. Before that,  every burden had to be carried on the back. Now the dogs helped the  people.          THE LEGEND OF THE PEACE PIPES    _Omaha_      The people came across a great water on logs tied together. They  pitched their tents on the shore. Then they thought to make for  themselves certain bounds within which they were to live and rules  which should govern them. They cleared a space of grass and weeds so  they could see each other's faces. They sat down and there was no  obstruction between them.    While they were holding a council, an owl hooted in the trees near by.  The leader said, \"That bird is to take part in our council. He calls  to us. He offers us his aid.\"    Immediately afterward they heard a woodpecker. He knocked against the  trees. The leader said, \"That bird calls to us. He offers us his aid.  He will take part in our council.\"    Then the chief appointed a man as servant. He said, \"Go into the woods  and get an ash sapling.\" The servant came back with a sapling having a  rough bark.    \"We do not want that,\" said the leader. \"Go again and get a sapling  with a smooth bark, bluish in color at the joint where a branch  comes.\" So the servant went out, and came back with a sapling of the  kind described.    When the leader took up the sapling, an eagle came and soared about  the council which was sitting in the grass. He dropped a downy  feather; it fell. It fell in the center of the cleared space. Now this  was the white eagle. The chief said, \"This is not what we want,\" so  the white eagle passed on.    Then the bald eagle came swooping down, as though attacking its prey.  It balanced itself on its wings directly over the cleared space. It  uttered fierce cries, and dropped one of its downy feathers, which  stood on the ground as the other eagle's feather had done. The chief  said, \"This is not what we want.\" So the bald eagle passed on.    Then came the spotted eagle, and soared over the council, and dropped  its feather as the others had done. The chief said, \"This is not what  we want,\" and the spotted eagle passed on.    Then the imperial eagle, the eagle with the fantail, came, and soared  over the people. It dropped a downy feather which stood upright in the  center of the cleared space. The chief said, \"This is what we want.\"    So the feathers of this eagle were used in making the peace pipes,  together with the feathers of the owl and woodpecker, and with other  things. These peace pipes were to be used in forming friendly  relations with other tribes.    When the peace pipes were made, seven other pipes were made for  keeping peace within the tribe. One pipe was to prevent revenge. If  one man should kill another, the chief took this pipe to the relatives  and offered it to them. If the relatives of the dead man refused to  accept it, it was offered again. It was offered four times. If it was  refused four times, the chief said, \"Well, you must take the  consequences. We will do nothing, and you cannot now ask to see the  pipes.\" He meant if they took revenge and any trouble came to them,  they could not ask for help or for mercy.    Each band had its own pipe.          A TRADITION OF THE CALUMET    _Lenni-Lenapi_      In the days of the old men, far to the north there lived a nation with  many villages. Their warriors were as many as the buffalo herds on the  plains toward the Darkening Land. Their tepees were many on the shores  of a beautiful lake and along wide rivers.    Then the Mysterious One, whose voice is in the clouds, told the chiefs  of a great nation, also of many villages, which hunted through all the  country from the Big Water in the sunrise to the mountains in the  Darkening Land.    Then the chiefs and the old men held a council. Runners came from many  villages to the great council. And the council voice was to go to the  great nation to the south, the nation with many villages, and bring  back scalps and horses.    So the chiefs and warriors went out, one by one. Then runners were  sent to all the villages, ordering the chiefs to dance the scalp  dance.    Suddenly there came through the sky a great white bird. It came from  the forest, and flew into the village of the great chief. It rested  above the head of the chief's daughter.    Then the chief's daughter heard a voice in her heart. The voice said,  \"Call all the chiefs and warriors together. Tell them the Mysterious  One is sad because they seek the scalps of the Lenni-Lenapi, the First  People. Tell the warriors they must wash their hands in the blood of a  young fawn. They must go with many presents to the First People. They  must carry to the First People Hobowakan, the calumet.\"    Thus the First People and the mighty people with many villages on the  shore of the lake smoked together the pipe of council. So there was  peace.

How long! O! how long!      How long will the friend of the slave plead in vain?  How long e'er the Christian will loosen the chain?  If he, by our efforts, more hardened should be,  O Father, forgive him! we trust but in thee.  That 'we're all free and equal,' how senseless the cry,  While millions in bondage are groaning so nigh!  O where is our freedom? equality where?  To this none can answer, but echo cries, where?    O'er this stain on our country we'd fain draw a veil,  But history's page will proclaim the sad tale,  That Christians, unblushing, could shout 'we are free,'  Whilst they the oppressors of millions could be.  They can feel for themselves, for the Pole they can feel,  Towards Afric's children their hearts are like steel;  They are deaf to their call, to their wrongs they are blind;  In error they slumber nor seek truth to find.    Though scorn and oppression on our pathway attend,  Despised and reviled, we the slave will befriend;  Our Father, thy blessing! we look but to thee,  Nor cease from our labors till all shall be free.  Should mobs in their fury with missiles assail,  The cause it is righteous, the truth will prevail;  Then heed not their clamors, though loud they proclaim  That freedom shall slumber, and slavery reign.          THE FUGITIVE SLAVE TO THE CHRISTIAN.    Words by Elizur Wright, jr. Music arranged from Cracovienne.      [Music]    The fetters galled my weary soul,--  A soul that seemed but thrown away;  I spurned the tyrant's base control,  Resolved at last the man to play:--    Chorus.      The hounds are baying on my track;    O Christian! will you send me back?    The hounds are baying on my track;    O Christian! will you send me back?    I felt the stripes, the lash I saw,  Red, dripping with a father's gore;  And, worst of all their lawless law,  The insults that my mother bore!    The hounds are baying on my track,    O Christian! will you send me back?    Where human law o'errules Divine,  Beneath the sheriff's hammer fell  My wife and babes,--I call them mine,--  And where they suffer, who can tell?    The hounds are baying on my track,    O Christian! will you send me back?    I seek a home where man is man,  If such there be upon this earth,  To draw my kindred, if I can,  Around its free, though humble hearth.    The hounds are baying on my track,    O Christian! will you send me back!          The Strength of Tyranny.      The tyrant's chains are only strong    While slaves submit to wear them;  And, who could bind them on the strong,    Determined not to wear them?  Then clank your chains, e'en though the links    Were light as fashion's feather:  The heart which rightly feels and thinks    Would cast them altogether.    The lords of earth are only great    While others clothe and feed them!  But what were all their pride and state    Should labor cease to heed them?  The swain is higher than a king:    Before the laws of nature,  The monarch were a useless thing,    The swain a useless creature.    We toil, we spin, we delve the mine,    Sustaining each his neighbor;  And who can hold a right divine    To rob us of our labor?  We rush to battle--bear our lot    In every ill and danger--  And who shall make the peaceful cot    To homely joy a stranger?    Perish all tyrants far and near,    Beneath the chains that bind us;  And perish too that servile fear    Which makes the slaves they find us:  One grand, one universal claim--    One peal of moral thunder--  One glorious burst in Freedom's name,    And rend our bonds asunder!          THE BLIND SLAVE BOY.    Words by Mrs. Dr. Bailey. Music arranged from Sweet Afton.      [Music]    Come back to me mother! why linger away  From thy poor little blind boy, the long weary day!  I mark every footstep, I list to each tone,  And wonder my mother should leave me alone!  There are voices of sorrow, and voices of glee,  But there's no one to joy or to sorrow with me;  For each hath of pleasure and trouble his share,  And none for the poor little blind boy will care.    My mother, come back to me! close to thy breast  Once more let thy poor little blind one be pressed;  Once more let me feel thy warm breath on my cheek,  And hear thee in accents of tenderness speak!  O mother! I've no one to love me--no heart  Can bear like thine own in my sorrows a part,  No hand is so gentle, no voice is so kind,  Oh! none like a mother can cherish the blind!    Poor blind one! No mother thy wailing can hear,  No mother can hasten to banish thy fear;  For the slave-owner drives her, o'er mountain and wild,  And for one paltry dollar hath sold thee, poor child!  Ah! who can in language of mortals reveal  The anguish that none but a mother can feel,  When man in his vile lust of mammon hath trod  On her child, who is stricken and smitten of God!    Blind, helpless, forsaken, with strangers alone,  She hears in her anguish his piteous moan;  As he eagerly listens--but listens in vain,  To catch the loved tones of his mother again!  The curse of the broken in spirit shall fall  On the wretch who hath mingled this wormwood and gall,  And his gain like a mildew shall blight and destroy,  Who hath torn from his mother the little blind boy!          SLAVE'S WRONGS.    Words by Miss Chandler. Arranged from \"Rose of Allandale.\"      [Music]    With aching brow and wearied limb,    The slave his toil pursued;  And oft I saw the cruel scourge    Deep in his blood imbrued;  He tilled oppression's soil where men    For liberty had bled,  And the eagle wing of Freedom waved    In mockery, o'er his head.    The earth was filled with the triumph shout    Of men who had burst their chains;  But his, the heaviest of them all,    Still lay on his burning veins;  In his master's hall there was luxury,    And wealth, and mental light;  But the very book of the Christian law,    Was hidden from his sight.    In his master's halls there was wine and mirth,    And songs for the newly free;  But his own low cabin was desolate    Of all but misery.  He felt it all--and to bitterness    His heart within him turned;  While the panting wish for liberty,    Like a fire in his bosom burned.    The haunting thought of his wrongs grew changed    To a darker and fiercer hue,  Till the horrible shape it sometimes wore    At last familiar grew;  There was darkness all within his heart,    And madness in his soul;  And the demon spark, in his bosom nursed,    Blazed up beyond control.    Then came a scene! oh! such a scene!    I would I might forget  The ringing sound of the midnight scream,    And the hearth-stone redly wet!  The mother slain while she shrieked in vain    For her infant's threatened life;  And the flying form of the frighted child,    Struck down by the bloody knife.    There's many a heart that yet will start    From its troubled sleep, at night,  As the horrid form of the vengeful slave    Comes in dreams before the sight.  The slave was crushed, and his fetters' link    Drawn tighter than before;  And the bloody earth again was drenched    With the streams of his flowing gore.    Ah! know they not, that the tightest band    Must burst with the wildest power?--  That the more the slave is oppressed and wronged,    Will be fiercer his rising hour?  They may thrust him back with the arm of might,    They may drench the earth with his blood--  But the best and purest of their own,    Will blend with the sanguine flood.    I could tell thee more--but my strength is gone,    And my breath is wasting fast;  Long ere the darkness to-night has fled,    Will my life from the earth have passed:  But this, the sum of all I have learned,    Ere I go I will tell to thee;--  If tyrants would hope for tranquil hearts,    They must let the oppressed go free.          MY CHILD IS GONE.    Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    Hark! from the winds a voice of woe,  The wild Atlantic in its flow,  Bears on its breast the murmur low,            My child is gone!    Like savage tigers o'er their prey,  They tore him from my heart away;  And now I cry, by night by day--            My child is gone!    How many a free-born babe is press'd  With fondness to its mother's breast,  And rocked upon her arms to rest,            While mine is gone!    No longer now, at eve I see,  Beneath the sheltering plantain tree,  My baby cradled on my knee,            For he is gone!    And when I seek my cot at night,  There's not a thing that meets my sight,  But tells me that my soul's delight,            My child, is gone!    I sink to sleep, and then I seem  To hear again his parting scream  I start and wake--'tis but a dream--            My child _is_ gone!    Gone--till my toils and griefs are o'er,  And I shall reach that happy shore,  Where negro mothers cry no more--            My child is gone!          COMFORT IN AFFLICTION.    Words by William Leggett. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    If yon bright stars which gem the night,    Be each a blissful dwelling sphere,  Where kindred spirits reunite    Whom death has torn asunder here,  How sweet it were at once to die,    And leave this blighted orb afar!  Mix soul with soul to cleave the sky,    And soar away from star to star!    But oh! how dark, how drear, how lone,    Would seem the brightest world of bliss,  If, wandering through each radiant one,    We failed to find the loved of this!    If there no more the ties should twine,    Which Death's cold hand alone can sever,  Ah! then those stars in mockery shine,    More hateful as they shine forever!    It cannot be--each hope and fear,    That lights the eye or clouds the brow,  Proclaims there is a happier sphere    Than this bleak world that holds us now!    There is a voice which sorrow hears,    When heaviest weighs life's galling chain,  'Tis heaven that whispers, \"dry thy tears,    The pure in heart shall meet again.\"          The Poor Little"]]]
