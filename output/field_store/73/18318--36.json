Day follows day in one long round,        Monotonous and blank and drear;      Less painful were it to be bound        On some bleak rock, for aye to hear--      Without one chance of getting free--        The ocean's melancholy voice!      Mine be the sin,--if sin there be,        But thou must make a different choice.\"        In the meek grace of virginhood        Unblanched her cheek, undimmed her eye,      Savitri, like a statue, stood,        Somewhat austere was her reply.      \"Once, and once only, all submit        To Destiny,--'tis God's command;      Once, and once only, so 'tis writ,        Shall woman pledge her faith and hand;      Once, and once only, can a sire        Unto his well-loved daughter say,      In presence of the witness fire,        I give thee to this man away.        \"Once, and once only, have I given        My heart and faith--'tis past recall;      With conscience none have ever striven,        And none may strive, without a fall.      Not the less solemn was my vow        Because unheard, and oh! the sin      Will not be less, if I should now        Deny the feeling felt within.      Unwedded to my dying day        I must, my father dear, remain;      'Tis well, if so thou will'st, but say        Can man balk Fate, or break its chain?        \"If Fate so rules, that I should feel        The miseries of a widow's life,      Can man's device the doom repeal?        Unequal seems to be a strife,      Between Humanity and Fate;        None have on earth what they desire;      Death comes to all or soon or late;        And peace is but a wandering fire;      Expediency leads wild astray;        The Right must be our guiding star;      Duty our watchword, come what may;        Judge for me, friends,--as wiser far.\"        She said, and meekly looked to both.        The father, though he patient heard,      To give the sanction still seemed loth,        But Narad Muni took the word.      \"Bless thee, my child! 'Tis not for us        To question the Almighty will,      Though cloud on cloud loom ominous,        In gentle rain they may distil.\"      At this, the monarch--\"Be it so!        I sanction what my friend approves;      All praise to Him, whom praise we owe;        My child shall wed the youth she loves.\"      PART II.        Great joy in Madra. Blow the shell        The marriage over to declare!      And now to forest-shades where dwell        The hermits, wend the wedded pair.      The doors of every house are hung        With gay festoons of leaves and flowers;      And blazing banners broad are flung,        And trumpets blown from castle towers!      Slow the procession makes its ground        Along the crowded city street:      And blessings in a storm of sound        At every step the couple greet.        Past all the houses, past the wall,        Past gardens gay, and hedgerows trim,      Past fields, where sinuous brooklets small        With molten silver to the brim      Glance in the sun's expiring light,        Past frowning hills, past pastures wild,      At last arises on the sight,        Foliage on foliage densely piled,      The woods primeval, where reside        The holy hermits;--henceforth here      Must live the fair and gentle bride:        But this thought brought with it no fear.        Fear! With her husband by her still?        Or weariness! Where all was new?      Hark! What a welcome from the hill!        There gathered are a hermits few.      Screaming the peacocks upward soar;        Wondering the timid wild deer gaze;      And from Briarean fig-trees hoar        Look down the monkeys in amaze      As the procession moves along;        And now behold, the bridegroom's sire      With joy comes forth amid the throng;--        What reverence his looks inspire!        Blind! With his partner by his side!        For them it was a hallowed time!      Warmly they greet the modest bride        With her dark eyes and front sublime!      One only grief they feel.--Shall she        Who dwelt in palace halls before,      Dwell in their huts beneath the tree?        Would not their hard life press her sore;--      The manual labour, and the want        Of comforts that her rank became,      Valkala robes, meals poor and scant,        All undermine the fragile frame?        To see the bride, the hermits' wives        And daughters gathered to the huts,      Women of pure and saintly lives!        And there beneath the betel-nuts      Tall trees like pillars, they admire        Her beauty, and congratulate      The parents, that their hearts' desire        Had thus accorded been by Fate,      And Satyavan their son had found        In exile lone, a fitting mate:      And gossips add,--good signs abound;        Prosperity shall on her wait.        Good signs in features, limbs, and eyes,        That old experience can discern,      Good signs on earth and in the skies,        That it could read at every turn.      And now with rice and gold, all bless        The bride and bridegroom,--and they go      Happy in others' happiness,        Each to her home, beneath the glow      Of the late risen moon that lines        With silver, all the ghost-like trees,      Sals, tamarisks, and South-Sea pines,        And palms whose plumes wave in the breeze.        False was the fear, the parents felt,        Savitri liked her new life much;      Though in a lowly home she dwelt        Her conduct as a wife was such      As to illumine all the place;        She sickened not, nor sighed, nor pined;      But with simplicity and grace        Discharged each household duty kind.      Strong in all manual work,--and strong        To comfort, cherish, help, and pray,      The hours past peacefully along        And rippling bright, day followed day.        At morn Satyavan to the wood        Early repaired and gathered flowers      And fruits, in its wild solitude,        And fuel,--till advancing hours      Apprised him that his frugal meal        Awaited him. Ah, happy time!      Savitri, who with fervid zeal        Had said her orisons sublime,      And fed the Bramins and the birds,        Now ministered. Arcadian love,      With tender smiles and honeyed words,        All bliss of earth thou art above!        And yet there was a spectre grim,        A skeleton in Savitri's heart,      Looming in shadow, somewhat dim,        But which would never thence depart.      It was that fatal, fatal speech        Of Narad Muni. As the days      Slipt smoothly past, each after each,        In private she more fervent prays.      But there is none to share her fears,        For how could she communicate      The sad cause of her bidden tears?        The doom approached, the fatal date.        No help from man. Well, be it so!        No sympathy,--it matters not!      God can avert the heavy blow!        He answers worship. Thus she thought.      And so, her prayers, by day and night,        Like incense rose unto the throne;      Nor did she vow neglect or rite        The Veds enjoin or helpful own.      Upon the fourteenth of the moon,        As nearer came the time of dread,      In Joystee, that is May or June,        She vowed her vows and Bramins fed.        And now she counted e'en the hours,        As to Eternity they past;      O'er head the dark cloud darker lowers,        The year is rounding full at last.      To-day,--to-day,--with doleful sound        The word seem'd in her ear to ring!      O breaking heart,--thy pain profound        Thy husband knows not, nor the king,      Exiled and blind, nor yet the queen;        But One knows in His place above.      To-day,--to-day,--it will be seen        Which shall be victor, Death or Love!        Incessant in her prayers from morn,        The noon is safely tided,--then      A gleam of faint, faint hope is born,        But the heart fluttered like a wren      That sees the shadow of the hawk        Sail on,--and trembles in affright,      Lest a down-rushing swoop should mock        Its fortune, and o'erwhelm it quite.      The afternoon has come and gone        And brought no change;--should she rejoice?      The gentle evening's shades come on,        When hark!--She hears her husband's voice!        \"The twilight is most beautiful!        Mother, to gather fruit I go,      And fuel,--for the air is cool        Expect me in an hour or so.\"      \"The night, my child, draws on apace,\"        The mother's voice was heard to say,      \"The forest paths are hard to trace        In darkness,--till the morrow stay.\"      \"Not hard for me, who can discern        The forest-paths in any hour,      Blindfold I could with ease return,        And day has not yet lost its power.\"        \"He goes then,\" thought Savitri, \"thus        With unseen bands Fate draws us on      Unto the place appointed us;        We feel no outward force,--anon      We go to marriage or to death        At a determined time and place;      We are her playthings; with her breath        She blows us where she lists in space.      What is my duty? It is clear,        My husband I must follow; so,      While he collects his forest gear        Let me permission get to go.\"        His sire she seeks,--the blind old king,        And asks from him permission straight.      \"My daughter, night with ebon wing        Hovers above; the hour is late.      My son is active, brave, and strong,        Conversant with the woods, he knows      Each path; methinks it would be wrong        For thee to venture where he goes,      Weak and defenceless as thou art,        At such a time. If thou wert near      Thou might'st embarrass him, dear heart,        Alone, he would not have a fear.\"        So spake the hermit-monarch blind,        His wife"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#4)"],[1,"and the interior of furred skins I  will give as    ARSENICAL SOLUTION.        Commercial arsenic       1 lb.      Bicarbonate of soda    1/2 lb.      Water                    5 pts.    Boil until arsenic and soda have dissolved, stirring frequently. Use a  vessel at least twice as large as necessary to contain the quantity used  as it foams up while boiling. When cold put in a large bottle or jar  marked _Poison_, of course. For poisoning finished specimens,  mounted heads, etc., take one part of this solution to two parts water  and spray the entire surface with this in an atomizer or larger sprayer.  It should be tested before using by dipping a black feather in it and if  a gray or white deposit is left on drying, it should be diluted still  further until this is prevented.    To poison the inside of skins we make Arsenical Paste: Arsenical  Solution (full strength), whiting sufficient to produce the consistency  of cream. This should be mixed in a wide mouthed bottle or small pan and  applied with a common paint brush. Do not apply to a perfectly dry skin,  like tanned hide for a robe or rug, but dampen the inside first with  clear water, then paint over with the paste and it will strike through  to the fur side and be taken up around the fur roots by capillary  action. This tends to put a damper on the activities of the moth, whose  favorite grazing ground is at the hair roots just outside the skin.    The paste is equally good on skins of birds, except, perhaps the smaller  ones, when freshly skinned, and some of the smaller mammals. The mixture  of whiting makes it easy to see when the surface has already been  treated, unless the skin is dressed white, in which case dry ochre may  be used in place of whiting.    For poisoning the skins of the smaller furred animals and all but the  larger birds:    DRY PRESERVATIVE.        Powdered white arsenic      Powdered alum    Mix equal parts by measure and apply to inside of the fresh skin with a  soft brush or pad of cotton. If during the skinning and cleaning the  skin has dried so the powder will not stick, moisten the inside of the  skin with water before applying. Some taxidermists prefer to use in  place of the paste some form of Arsenical Soap. This may be purchased  from the supply dealer or made at home at quite a reduction. Personally  I dislike the greasy, sticky feel of it; it is apt to cling around the  finger nails and scratches, making them sore.    However, the following is the best formula for a time honored  preservative:    HORNADAY'S ARSENICAL SOAP.        White bar soap            1 lb.      Powdered arsenic          1 lb.      Camphor gum               2-1/2 oz.      Subcarbonate of potash    3 oz.      Alcohol (wood or grain)   4 oz.    Slice the soap and melt slowly with a little water. When melted stir in  the potash and arsenic. Boil to the consistency of molasses and pour  into a jar to harden. Add the camphor already dissolved in the alcohol  and stir occasionally while cooling. Mix with water and apply with a  paint brush to flesh side of skins.    In case one is timid about using any of the arsenical preparations I  would advise them to try    BROWNE'S NON-POISONOUS PRESERVATIVE SOAP.        Whiting          24 oz.      White soap        8 oz.      Chloride lime   1/2 oz.      Tincture camphor  1 oz.      Water             1 pt.    Shave the soap thin and boil it with the whiting and water till  dissolved. Then remove from the fire and stir in the chloride, adding  the tincture camphor later when cold, as much of the strength of the  latter would be lost were the mixture hot.    Keep in closed jars or bottles, and if too thick, thin down with water  or alcohol. Apply like arsenical soap or paste. This is highly  recommended by English writers. For a non-poisonous powder I would  advise equal parts of powdered alum and insect powder in place of the  arsenic and alum.    SOLUTION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF SMALL SPECIMENS ENTIRE.        Formaldehyde (40% strength)  1 part      Water                        9 parts    Mix thoroughly and put in glass or earthen jars or large mouthed  bottles.    While most of the heads and skins of big game are preserved until they  can reach the taxidermist, many of the smaller specimens become a total  loss. Lack of time and knowledge are the chief causes of this loss of  valuable souvenirs of days out of doors and interesting natural objects.  Probably the easiest and least expensive method of temporarily  preserving entire the smaller animals, birds, fish and reptiles is by  immersion in the above preparation.    I would not advise its use on animals larger than a small fox or cat,  and to insure an immediate penetration of the flesh the abdominal  viscera should be removed from the larger specimens. The amount of  solution used should be about ten times the volume of the subject, and  it had best be replaced with fresh liquid after two or three days. I  think this will work equally well on birds, reptiles and mammals.    On removal from the solution they may be skinned and mounted as fresh  specimens. On removing from the solution, rinse in water containing a  little ammonia to neutralize the irritating odor of the formaldehyde. Do  not stand over the solution while mixing as the fumes of the formic acid  affect the eyes. The condensed form in which this chemical can be  carried and its cheapness (30c. per lb.), make it desirable as a  temporary preservative. The saying, \"It never rains but it pours,\"  applies to the taxidermist and a sudden rush of subjects may often be  saved by using the foregoing preparation. Other work may be under way,  or for other reasons it may be desirable to keep a specimen in the flesh  a short time before mounting.    ALCOHOLIC SOLUTION.        Alcohol (94% strength)  Equal parts      Water    If alcohol is less than 94% use less water. Use same as formaldehyde  solution. This is said to be superior to the formaldehyde solution,  though more expensive and harder to carry about on account of its  greater bulk before mixing.    Specimens kept long in any liquid are apt to lose their colors. This  fading will be reduced to a minimum if kept in the dark.    In order to do any satisfactory work on quadrupeds the taxidermist makes  use of a bath or pickle of some sort for keeping skins in a wet state.  This pickle sets the hair and in a measure tans the skin, reducing its  liability to shrinkage and rendering it less desirable pasturage for  insects.    All furred skins of any size should be immersed in this for a time  before mounting, and may be kept in it for months or years without  injury. If you have time to skin an animal properly the skin may be  dropped in the pickle jar and in a day, week, or month be better fit for  final mounting than at first.    For the first few days it is necessary to move it about every day so all  parts may be exposed to the action of the pickle. The form of pickle  which I have found most helpful is:    TANNING LIQUOR.        Water                    1 gal.      Salt                     1 qt.      Sulphuric acid (measure) 1 oz.    Bring to boiling point to dissolve the salt. Allow to cool before  stirring in the acid. When cold is ready for use.    When keeping skins in a wet state a long time I would prefer to use:    SALT AND ALUM PICKLE.        Water  1 gal.      Salt   1 qt.      Alum   1 pt.    Boil to dissolve salt and alum; use like preceding.    If skins are to be kept some time they should, after a preliminary  pickling, be put in new, fresh pickle and it should be occasionally  tested with a salinometer and kept up to the original strength. Dirty  and greasy pickle should be thrown away, but if clean and of low  strength it can be brought up by adding new pickle of extra strength. It  will do no hurt if more salt, even a saturated solution, is made of  either of the foregoing.    While the salt and alum or acid pickle will keep our animal skins safely  and in a relaxed condition ready for further preparation at any time, it  will not answer for bird skins. For this we have a solution for keeping  bird skins soft:        Glycerine               2 parts      Carbolic acid           1 part    After skinning the bird and applying some arsenical solution to the  inside, brush this solution liberally over the entire inside of the  skin. Pay special attention to the bones, wing and leg, skull and root  of the tail. If necessary the skin may be packed flat for shipment. One  treatment will keep all but the larger skins soft for several months.  The feet, of course, will become hard and dry and must be relaxed as  usual before mounting.    Every taxidermist needs to be more or less of a modeler, and one of the  most useful materials is:    PAPIER MACHE.        Wet wood pulp                        10 oz.      Glue (hot) or LePage's (measure)      3 oz.      Plaster paris, dry                   20 oz.    This formula may be varied at the convenience of the operator. Work the  glue into the pulp and knead the plaster into the mass. The more glue  the slower it sets and a few drops of glycerine will keep it soft  several days. Made with little or no glue it hardens quickly.    If the paper pulp is not at hand it may be made by tearing old  newspapers or sheathing paper small and boiling and pounding till a pulp  results. This composition is much in use in Europe in the making of many  familiar toys and similar objects.    For modeling open mouths, finishing mounted specimens, making artificial  rocks, stumps and boughs, it is very desirable.    WAX FOR OPEN MOUTHS.        Beeswax               1 part      Paraffin wax          1 part    Melt and color with tube oil colors. To color dip up a spoonful of  melted wax, squeeze some tube color in and stir until stiff. Place the  spoon in the hot wax and stir till evenly mixed. Do not try to put the  color directly in the hot wax as it will not mix evenly so.    Wax should be melted in a water"]]]
