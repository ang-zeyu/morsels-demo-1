In the same way with ourselves.  We live our lives by hinging them on our aims and purposes and ideas,  and do not ask ourselves what are the causes of our attitudes and of our  thoughts.    This purposive view has in no respect to disappear if we move on from  our personal intercourse to a scholarly study of reality. The historian,  for instance, who tries to understand the will relations of humanity, is  the more the true historian the more he sticks to this purposive view of  man. The truth which he seeks is to interpret the personalities, to  understand them through their attitudes, to make their will living once  more, and to link it by agreement and disagreement, by love and hate,  with the will of friends and enemies, groups and parties, nations and  mankind. It is only a loose popular way of speaking, if this purposive  analysis of a character is often called psychological. In a stricter  sense of the word, it is not psychological. If the historian really were  to take the psychological attitude, he would make of history simply a  social psychology, seeking the laws of the social mind, and treating the  individual, the hero, and the leader, merely as the crossing-point of  psychological law. For such a psychological view the mental life of the  hero would not be more important or more interesting than the mental  life of a scoundrel, and the psychology of the king would not draw his  interest more than the psychology of the beggar. The historian has to  shape all that from an entirely different standpoint: his scientific  interest depends upon the importance of men's attitudes and actions, and  such importance refers to the world of purposes.    In the same way, we have to stick to the non-psychological point of view  whenever man's life, his thoughts and feelings and volitions, are to be  measured with reference to ideals; that is in ethics and aesthetics and  logic, sciences which ask whether the volitions are good or bad, whether  the feelings are valuable or worthless, whether the thoughts are true or  false. The psychologist does not care; just as the botanist is  interested in the weed as much as in the flower, the psychologist is  interested in the causal connections of the most heinous crime not less  than in those of the noblest deed, in the structure of the most absurd  error not less than in that of the maturest wisdom. Truth, beauty, and  morality are thus expressions of the self in its purposive aspect.    We can go one step further. Those who narrowly seek every truth only in  the scientific understanding, ought to be reminded that this seeking for  causal connections is itself, after all, only a life experience which as  such is not of causal but of purposive character. \"Life is bigger than  thought.\" In the immediate reality of our purposive life we aim towards  mastering the world by a causal understanding, and for this end we  create science; but this aim itself is then a purpose and not an object.  The first act is thus for us, the thinkers, not a part of the causal  events, but a purposive intention towards an ideal. Therefore, our  purposes have the first right; they represent the fundamental reality;  the value of causal connections and thus of all scientific and  psychological explanation, depends on the value of the purpose. Causal  truth can be only the second word; the first word remains to purposive  truth. From this point of view we may understand why there is no  conflict between the most consistent causal explanation of mental life  on the one side, and an idealistic view of life on the other side; yes,  we can see that the fullest emphasis on a scientific psychology--which  is necessarily realistic and, to a certain degree, materialistic--is  fully embedded in an idealistic philosophy of life, and that without  conflict. And we shall see how this consistency in sharply separating  the psychological view from the non-psychological, secures much greater  safety for true idealism than the inconsistent popular mixing of the  two principles, where scientific psychology is constantly encroached  upon by demands of faith and religion, and where faith and religion seem  constantly in danger of being overturned by new discoveries in  physiological psychology. We may, indeed, remove from the start the  mistaken fear that a consistent causal aspect of life leads to injustice  to the higher aims and ideal purposes of mankind. If we want to have  psychology,--and that means if we want to consider the mental life in a  system of causes and effects,--we must proceed without prejudices, and  without side-thoughts.    From a psychological standpoint our own mental life and that of our  neighbor, that of the man and that of the child, that of the normal and  that of the insane, that of the human being and that of the animal, are  to be considered as a series of mental objects. They are to be analyzed,  and to be described, and to be classified and to be explained, just as  we deal with the physical objects in the outer world. How are these  objects of the psychologist different from the objects of the physicist,  from the pebbles on the way and the stars in the sky? There is only one  fundamental difference and all other differences result from it. Those  outer objects which we call physical, are objects for everybody. The  star which I see is conceived as the same star which you see, the table  which I touch is the table which you may grasp, too. But every psychical  object is an object for one particular person only. My visual impression  of the star, that is, my optical perception, is a content of my own  consciousness only, and your impression of the star can be a content of  your consciousness only. We both may mean the same by our ideas, but I  can never have your perception and you can never have my perception. My  ideas are enclosed in my mind. I may awaken in your mind ideas which  have the same purpose and meaning, but they are new copies in your mind.  We both may be angry, but your anger can never be my anger, and your  volitions can never enter my mind. Every possible psychical fact thus  exists in one consciousness only, while every physical fact exists for  every possible consciousness.    The psychologist's final task is to explain the appearance and  disappearance, the connections and sequences of these mental objects,  the contents of consciousness. But before he can start on explanation of  the facts, he has to describe them, and describing means analyzing them  into their elements and fixating those elements and their combinations  for an exact report. Such descriptive work is in a way preparatory for  the further task of real explanation; yet it is in itself important,  complicated, and difficult. Of course, it may be easy to separate the  complex content into some big groups of facts, to point out that this is  a memory idea and this an imaginative idea and the other an abstract  idea, and this a perception and that a feeling, this an emotion and that  a volition. But such clumsy first discrimination does not go further,  perhaps, than does the naturalist's, who tells us that this is a  mountain and that a tree, this a pond and that a bird. The real  description would demand, of course, an exact measurement of the height  of the mountain and the geological analysis of its structure, or an  exact classification of the tree and the bird, with a complete  description of their organs, and in each organ the various tissues have  to be described, and in each tissue the various cells, and the  microscopist goes further and describes the structure of the cell.  Certainly in the same way the psychologist has to go on to resolve every  one of those complex structures; he has to examine the mental tissues  and the mental cells of which a volition or a memory idea or a  perception are composed. And while he cannot use a microscope for these  mental elements, yet his studies may cause elements to appear which the  naive observation remains entirely unaware of.    Perhaps he finds in his consciousness the perception of the table before  him which lingers for a little while in his mind. He finds no difficulty  in analyzing it into color sensations and tactual sensations; and yet he  is aware of so much more in it. The table, for instance, has form for  him and he may find that these form perceptions involve the sensations  of the eye movements which he makes from one corner of the table to the  other; he may find that if the idea lasts in him, he becomes aware of  the time by sensations of tension; he finds that in his perception of  the table lies an idea of its use, and he discovers that that is made up  of elements which are partly memory reproductions of earlier  impressions, partly sensations of movement impulses; he also finds that  the table feels smooth, and he discovers by his analysis that this  impression of smoothness results from a special combination of tactual  sensations and movement sensations; and again those movement sensations  he analyzes further into sensations of muscle contraction and sensations  of pressure in the joints and sensations of tension in the tendons.  Before a zooelogist has completed his description of a bird in the  landscape, he has given account of hundreds of thousands of things; but  before the psychologist would complete the enumeration of the mental  elements which enter into the seeing of the table, he would have to give  account of by far more psychical elements. Every point in the surface of  the table has its own light value, perhaps different in its quality and  intensity and saturation, in its hue and tint and shade from the next  one, and at whatever point of the table's edge our attention is  directed, each one involves numberless shades in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22776"],[0,"From a Terrace in Prague (#4)"],[1,"history, men  whose imagination nurtured on lovely legends, on great traditions amid  the beauties of one of Europe's fairest countries, found expression in  works of lasting worth: I need only mention such names as Palacky,  Tomek, and Luetzow among many.    Of strangers who have been charmed to pertinent utterance by the glory  and beauty of Prague there is an imposing array. In the fifteenth  century AEneas Silvius, afterwards Pope Pius II, came this way, and  described Prague as the \"Queen of Towns.\" Then Goethe, whose glowing pen  could add colour to the vibrant beauty of Italian landscape, writes of  Prague as \"der Mauerkrone der Erde kostbarste Stein.\" We will interpret  this, as it is no longer the fashion to understand German, especially in  Prague: \"the most precious jewel in the mural crown of this earth.\"  Another German, Alexander von Humboldt, gives to Prague fourth place  among the world's \"cities beautiful.\"    Rodin considered Prague as the \"Rome of the North,\" a comparison that  seems rather trite at first, but those who feel the meaning of this city  will understand and appreciate the French sculptor's judgment. Prague  has, at least superficially, one quality in common with Rome; in your  wanderings in either city you may come suddenly upon something of beauty  so stupendous as to take your breath away.    Other French visitors of importance show a tendency to dwell upon the  character of the Bohemians in general rather than on the beauty of their  capital. With keen perception they draw the deeper meaning from out the  stones of Prague; thus in the fifties of the last century writes  Viollet-le-Duc, \"Prague est une capitale dans laquelle on sent la  puissance d'un grand peuple,\" and Massieu de Clerval is yet more  emphatic: \"si un pays peut se vanter d'une nationalite indestructible  c'est a coup sur la Boheme.--Une nation qui a passe par de pareilles  epreuves ne perira, elle a vaincu la mort.\"    We must not overlook yet another visitor to Prague whose outlook was  practical rather than romantic, Ibrahim Ibn Jacub. This Jewish trader  from Arabia travelled in Bohemia some time in the tenth century, and was  much struck with Prague, \"a great commercial town of stone-built  houses.\"    So we who would add a belated word of tribute to the glory of Prague the  Golden find ourselves indeed in goodly company. Moreover, we live in the  present, and have, as far as this book is concerned, only just arrived  in Prague.    The morning sun that tips the pinnacles of the Castle of Prague with  gold, that dispels the purple shadows in which the city lies shrouded,  and calls forth sparkling facets on the broad river, dissipates our  dreams of cities that have failed and perished. It summons us to study  this ancient city, old yet ever young. Beautiful, too, in all the  varying glints of light upon the spires and turrets of its hundred  towers, when the morning breeze comes down-stream and rustles in the  trees that deck the islands, to the golden glory of the sunset behind  the purple masses of the castle. Then a short star-lit night while  Prague rests in dreams of former greatness to gain strength to face its  high duties of the morrow.    Indeed, Prague is an ancient city, yet young and active and wonderfully  beautiful in all its aspects.    It is not my intention to conduct you round Prague, to introduce to you  one by one the many features of the city, and tell you all there is to  know about them. This for two excellent reasons: one, that I am far from  having got to the end of such knowledge myself, the other that you may  be induced to come here and find out for yourself how much of interest  and of beauty lies open before you.    As in introducing a friend, I mean to state only a few salient points,  to give you a hint of the city's story here and there as told by ancient  buildings, as shown in public haunts or quiet nooks, hoping that in your  turn you may make a friend of this venerable, this beautiful Prague.          CHAPTER II    Discusses the question of guides and guide-books, and tries to explain  the author's method, or lack of it, when making himself acquainted with  places of interest. Contains also remarks on terraces, which are  expected to edify. There is a good deal about the weather of Prague,  about the gardens at different seasons, also an account of merrymaking  in bygone days, and some reflections, in the same spirit, on present-day  rejoicings.      There are various ways of becoming acquainted with an interesting city.  Some people invest in a guide-book before starting out on the journey,  others do not rest until they have bought one or more on arriving at  their destination. You may notice these people studying the book on the  boat perhaps, certainly in the train; they even let the book interfere  with the proper attention that is due to meals; and allow me to remark  here that the wagon-lit people are very sound on the question of food.    These people are slaves to the guide-book; they leave it not, day or  night, and the more methodical they are in conforming to the cramped  spirit of the book, the less do they discover things by themselves. No  guide-book ever can initiate you into the atmosphere of a city like  Prague.    The sight of the guide-book slave \"doing\" an ancient and glorious city  always fills me with sorrow, sometimes, indeed, with annoyance. These  slaves frequently hunt in couples, male and female, sometimes with  progeny at heel, and it is generally the male who discovers things--in  the guide-book--and then drags the rest of his outfit in search of his  discovery. As this is usually done at a reckless pace, the performance  is apt to upset the repose of the inhabitants whose perambulations of  their native place are in marked contrast to the silent, ruthless hurry  in the streets of our large towns. The good burghers of foreign towns  seem to have plenty of their own and other people's time to spare; they  also possess the gift of unlimited conversational powers. I have known  many a pleasant chat rudely interrupted by a group of British or  American travellers who, with nose well inside a book, blue or red but  obviously \"guide,\" push their way, ruthless as Juggernaut, through  bunches of inoffensive natives. There is one consolation: those slaves  of the guide-book frequently miss the prettiest bits, just because they  are looking into the book instead of around them.    Ask such as they about the atmosphere of some old-world haunt, and you  will probably hear complaints about the food or the service.    Some tourists aggravate their position by hiring a guide. Every city of  any historic importance breeds a class of mortals that are born guides;  they have come to belong to the \"staffage\" of picturesque surroundings;  and in this respect Prague is happily yet unspoilt. The born guide, when  young, is generally to be found running after you barefooted, clamouring  for coppers or cigarettes. His picturesqueness is due to the fact that  he does not disclose the incipient traits of villainy in his face by  washing it. The adult of the species does wash his face sometimes, but  he has no other virtues. The species \"guide\" is found in its perfection  in Southern Europe. Some day I must write a book on \"Guides I have  Spurned\"; there were many, and I have had to acquire a cursory  acquaintance with several foreign languages in order to deal adequately  with the spurning action which is chiefly vocal and invective. For the  present I can only remember one of the many spurned ones. He had been  following me about all over the ruins of a Moorish castle, and finally,  breathless, came up with me by a little pile of stones leaning, with  some faint attempt at symmetry, against a wall. In gusts a  garlic-charged voice explained, \"Zat modern. Zat rabbit-'ouse!\" In his  case the spurning could be done quite conveniently in English.    We cannot all afford to be original. I lay no claim to that quality for  myself; my method of making the acquaintance of such an interesting old  city as Prague may be that of thousands of other wayfarers. However this  may be, I propose to explain my method, not necessarily in order to  induce others to adopt it, but rather because it explains the title of  this work. I look upon cities, landscapes, in fact upon life in general,  from a terrace--not over or through the leaves of a guide-book.    There is a deal more interest in a terrace, and you can always find one  if you really want to do so, than the casual passer-by is inclined to  realize. It is easy to reconstruct the scene of building up the first  terrace. Some fairly primitive man had emancipated himself from the  old-fashioned ancestral habit of just letting the rain wash away the  hillside, and with it the family's prospects of green food for the  season. Squatting outside his cave he had done some hard thinking which,  transmitted into action, had led him to build up a wall here and there  on the hillside, a wall of clumsy stones kept in place by stakes  hammered into the ground, yet a wall, indeed a terrace, and an advance  upon the methods of his neighbours whose struggles he could watch from  the surer footing he himself had gained--a terrace and a point of view.    It is not suggested that the wayfarer on arriving in a strange city  should make a bee-line for the nearest terrace.    There are terraces and terraces, each one with its own definable point  of view, and it is this quality which should influence the traveller's  choice. Prague offers considerable variety in terraces suitable to every  conceivable outlook on life. You may choose a terrace that looks out  over the factory quarter of Prague, over grimy Smichov for instance, and  make notes on the growing industrial prosperity of the city. You will  probably be smoked out of your position, for a cheap and nasty variety  of brown coal is used by local industries. If you belong to the eclectic  you "]]]
