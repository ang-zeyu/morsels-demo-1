The companies had  to be formed into workable battalions, the battalions into brigades.  There was a deplorable lack of cavalry, artillery, engineers,  commissariat, transport, medical services, and, above all, staff.  Armament was bad; other munitions were worse. There would have been  no chance whatever of holding Harper's Ferry unless the Northern  conglomeration had been even less like a fighting army than the  Southern was.    Harper's Ferry was not only important in itself but still more  important for what it covered: the wonderfully fruitful Shenandoah  Valley, running southwest a hundred and forty miles to the neighborhood  of Lexington, with an average width of only twenty-four. Bounded  on the west by the Alleghanies and on the east by the long Blue  Ridge this valley was a regular covered way by which the Northern  invaders might approach, cut Virginia in two (for West Virginia  was then a part of the State) and, after devastating the valley  itself (thus destroying half the food-base of Virginia) attack  eastern Virginia through whichever gaps might serve the purpose  best. More than this, the only direct line from Richmond to the  Mississippi ran just below the southwest end of the valley, while  a network of roads radiated from Winchester near the northeast  end, thirty miles southwest of Harper's Ferry.    Throughout the month of May Jackson went on working his men into  shape and watching the enemy, three thousand strong, at Chambersburg,  forty-five miles north of Harper's Ferry, and twelve thousand strong  farther north still. One day he made a magnificent capture of rolling  stock on the twenty-seven miles of double track that centered in  Harper's Ferry. This greatly hampered the accumulation of coal at  Washington besides helping the railroads of the South. Destroying  the line was out of the question, because it ran through West Virginia  and Maryland, both of which he hoped to see on the Confederate  side. He was himself a West Virginian, born at Clarksburg; and it  grieved him greatly when West Virginia stood by the Union.    Apart from this he did nothing spectacular. The rest was all just  sheer hard work. He kept his own counsel so carefully that no one  knew anything about what he would do if the enemy advanced. Even  the officers of outposts were forbidden to notice or mention his  arrival or departure on his constant tours of inspection, lest a  longer look than usual at any point might let an awkward inference  be drawn. He was the sternest of disciplinarians when the good of  the service required it. But no one knew better that the finest  discipline springs from self-sacrifice willingly made for a worthy  cause; and no one was readier to help all ranks along toward real  efficiency in the kindest possible way when he saw they were doing  their best.    At the end of May Johnston took over the command of the increasing  force at Harper's Ferry, while Jackson was given the First Shenandoah  Brigade, a unit soon, like himself, to be raised by service into  fame.      On the first and third of May Virginia issued calls for more men;  and on the third Lincoln, who quite understood the signs of the  times, called for men whose term of service would be three years  and not three months.    Just a week later Missouri was saved for the Union by the daring  skill of two determined leaders, Francis P. Blair, a Member of  Congress who became a good major-general, and Captain Nathaniel Lyon,  an excellent soldier, who commanded the little garrison of regulars  at St. Louis. When Lincoln called upon Governor Claiborne Jackson  to supply Missouri's quota of three-month volunteers the Governor  denounced the proposed coercion as \"illegal, unconstitutional,  revolutionary, inhuman, and diabolical\"; and thereafter did his  best to make Missouri join the South. But Blair and Lyon were too  quick for him. Blair organized the Home Guards, whom Lyon armed  from the arsenal. Lyon then sent all the surplus arms and stores  across the river into Illinois, while he occupied the most commanding  position near the arsenal with his own troops, thus forestalling  the Confederates, under Brigadier-General D. M. Frost, who was now  forced to establish Camp Jackson in a far less favorable place. So  vigorously had Blair and Lyon worked that they had armed thousands  while Frost had only armed hundreds. But when Frost received siege  guns and mortars from farther south Lyon felt the time had come  for action.    Lyon was a born leader, though Grant and Sherman (then in St. Louis  as junior ex-officers, quite unknown to fame) were almost the only  men, apart from Blair, to see any signs of preÃ«minence in this  fiery little redheaded, weather-beaten captain, who kept dashing  about the arsenal, with his pockets full of papers, making sure  of every detail connected with the handful of regulars and the  thousands of Home Guards.    On the ninth of May Lyon borrowed an old dress from Blair's  mother-in-law, completing the disguise with a thickly veiled sunbonnet,  and drove through Camp Jackson. That night he and Blair attended  a council of war, at which, overcoming all opposition, answering  all objections, and making all arrangements, they laid their plans  for the morrow. When Lyon's seven thousand surrounded Frost's seven  hundred the Confederates surrendered at discretion and were marched  as prisoners through St. Louis. There were many Southern sympathizers  among the crowds in the streets; one of them fired a pistol; and  the Home Guards fired back, killing several women and children  by mistake. This unfortunate incident hardened many neutrals and  even Unionists against the Union forces; so much so that Sterling  Price, a Unionist and former governor, became a Confederate general,  whose field for recruiting round Jefferson City on the Missouri  promised a good crop of enemies to the Union cause.    Lyon and Blair wished to march against Price immediately and smash  every hostile force while still in the act of forming. But General  Harney, who commanded the Department of the West, returned to St.  Louis the day after the shooting and made peace instead of war with  Price. By the end of the month, however, Lincoln removed Harney and  promoted Lyon in his place; whereupon Price and Governor Jackson at  once prepared to fight. Then sundry neutrals, of the gabbling kind  who think talk enough will settle anything, induced the implacables  to meet in St. Louis. The conference was ended by Lyon's declaration  that he would see every Missourian under the sod before he would  take any orders from the State about any Federal matter, however  small. \"This,\" he said in conclusion, \"means war.\" And it did.    Again a single week sufficed for the striking of the blow. The  conference was held on the eleventh of June. On the fourteenth  Lyon reached Jefferson City only to find that the Governor had  decamped for Boonville, still higher up the Missouri. Here, on  the seventeenth, Lyon attacked him with greatly superior numbers  and skill, defeated him utterly, and sent him flying south with  only a few hundred followers left. Boonville was, in itself, a  very small affair indeed. But it had immense results. Lyon had  seized the best strategic point of rail and river junction on the  Mississippi by holding St. Louis. He had also secured supremacy  in arms, munitions, and morale. By turning the Governor out of  Jefferson City, the State capital, he had deprived the Confederates  of the prestige and convenience of an acknowledged headquarters.  Now, by defeating him at Boonville and driving his forces south in  headlong flight he had practically made the whole Missouri River a  Federal line of communication as well as a barrier between would-be  Confederates to the north and south of it. More than this, the  possession of Boonville struck a fatal blow at Confederate recruiting  and organization throughout the whole of that strategic area; for  Boonville was the center to which pro-Southern Missourians were  flocking. The tide of battle was to go against the Federals at  Wilson's Creek in the southwest of the State, and even at Lexington  on the Missouri, as we shall presently see; but this was only the  breaking of the last Confederate waves. As a State, Missouri was  lost to the South already.    In Kentucky, the next border State, opinions were likewise divided;  and Kentuckians fought each other with help from both sides. Anderson,  of Fort Sumter fame, was appointed to the Kentucky command in May.  But here the crisis did not occur for months, while a border campaign  was already being fought in West Virginia.    West Virginia, which became a separate State during the war, was  strongly Federal, like eastern Tennessee. These Federal parts of  two Confederate States formed a wedge dangerous to the whole South,  especially to Virginia and the Carolinas. Each side therefore tried  to control this area itself. The Federals, under McClellan, of  whom we shall soon hear more, had two lines of invasion into West  Virginia, both based on the Ohio. The northern converged by rail,  from Wheeling and Parkersburg, on Grafton, the only junction in  West Virginia. The southern ran up the Great Kanawha, with good  navigation to Charleston and water enough for small craft on to  Gauley Bridge, which was the strategic point.    In May the Confederates cut the line near Grafton. As this broke  direct communication between the West and Washington, McClellan  sent forces from which two flying columns, three thousand strong,  converged on Philippi, fifteen miles south of Grafton, and surprised  a thousand Confederates. These thereupon retired, with little loss,  to Beverly, thirty miles farther south still. Here there was a  combat at Rich Mountain on the eleventh of July. The Confederates  again retreated, losing General Garnett in a skirmish the following  day.

Secession, therefore, made the inevitable task of establishing the  supremacy of the white man in South Africa infinitely more costly both  in blood and treasure. The British nation accepted the task, which fell  to it as paramount power, with the greatest reluctance. The endless and  apparently aimless Kafir wars exhausted the patience of the country, and  the destruction of an entire British regiment by Ketshwayo's[4] _impis_  created a feeling of deep resentment against the great High  Commissioner, whose policy was held--unreasonably enough--responsible  for the military disaster of Isandlhwana. Two opportunities of  recovering the lost solidarity of the Europeans were presented before  the republican Dutch had set themselves definitely to work for the  supremacy of South Africa through reunion with their colonial kinsfolk.  That both were lost was due at bottom to the disgust of the British  people at the excessive cost and burden of establishing a civilised  administration over the native population in South Africa. But in both  cases the immediate agency of disaster was the refusal of the Home  Government to listen to the advice of its local representative. Sir  George Grey would have regained the lost solidarity of the Europeans by  taking advantage of the natural recoil manifested among the Free State  Dutch from independence and responsibility towards the more settled and  prosperous life assured by British rule. His proposal was to unite the  Cape Colony, Natal, and the Free State in a federal legislature,  consisting of representatives chosen by popular vote in the several  states. In urging this measure he took occasion to combat the  pessimistic views of South African affairs which were prevalent in  England. The country was not commercially useless, but of \"great and  increasing value.\" Its people did not desire Kafir wars, but were well  aware of the much greater advantages which they derived from the  peaceful pursuits of industry. The colonists were themselves willing to  contribute to the defence of that part of the Queen's dominions in which  they lived. And, finally, the condition of the natives was not hopeless,  for the missionaries were producing most beneficial effects upon the  tribes of the interior. But the most powerful argument which Grey used  was his ruthless exposure of the futility of the Conventions. By  allowing the Boer emigrants to grow into independent communities the  British Government believed that not only had they relieved themselves  of responsibility for the republican Dutch, but that they had secured,  in addition, the unfaltering allegiance of the larger Dutch population  which remained behind in the Cape Colony. Grey assured the Home  Government that in both respects it was the victim of a delusion bred of  its complete ignorance of South African conditions. The Boer Republics  would give trouble. Apart from the bad draftsmanship of the  conventions--a fertile source of disagreement--these small states would  be centres of intrigue and \"internal commotions,\" while at the same time  their revenues would be too small to provide efficiently for their  protection against the warlike tribes. The policy of _divide et  impera_--or, as Grey called it, the \"dismemberment\" policy--would fail,  since the political barrier which had been erected was wholly  artificial.             [Footnote 4: Cetewayo.]         \"Although these European countries are treated as separate       nations,\" he wrote, \"their inhabitants bear the same family names       as the inhabitants of this Colony, and maintain with them ties of       the closest intimacy and relationship. They speak generally the       same language--not English, but Dutch. They are for the most part       of the same religion, belonging to the Dutch Reformed Church.       They have the same laws--the Roman Dutch. They have the same       sympathies, the same prejudices, the same habits, and frequently       the same feelings regarding the native races....         \"I think that there can be no doubt that, in any great public, or       popular, or national question or movement, the mere fact of       calling these people different nations would not make them so,       nor would the fact of a mere fordable stream running between them       sever their sympathies or prevent them from acting in unison....       Many questions might arise in which, if the Government on the       south side of the Orange River took a different view from that on       the north side of the river, it might be very doubtful which of       the two Governments the great mass of the people would obey.\"[5]             [Footnote 5: Despatch of November 19th, 1858, to Sir E. B.           Lytton.]    The \"divergence of opinion\" between Capetown and Downing Street was  complete. Grey was charged with \"direct disobedience\" for listening to  the offers of the Free State inhabitants. Recalled by a despatch of  June 4th, 1859, he was reinstated in August on condition that \"he felt  himself sufficiently free and uncompromised,\" both with the Cape  Legislature and the people of the Free State, to be able personally to  carry out the policy of the Home Government, which, said the despatch,         \"is entirely opposed to those measures, tending to the resumption       of sovereignty over that State, of which you have publicly       expressed your approval in your speech to the Cape Parliament,       and in your answers to the address from the State in question.\"    Nor was that all. In his endeavours to establish a simple but  effective system of European magistrates over the Kafirs beyond the  eastern border of the Colony, he was hampered by the short-sighted  economy of the Home Government. It seems incredible that a Colonial  Governor, even at that epoch, should have been looked upon by Downing  Street as a sort of importunate mendicant. But Grey's language shows  that this was the attitude against which he had to defend himself.    [Sidenote: The burden of the empire.]         \"I would now only urge upon Her Majesty's Government,\" he writes       on September 8th, 1858, \"that they should not distress me more       than is absolutely necessary for the government and control of       the people of the country which lies beyond the Colony of the       Cape of Good Hope. Stripping the country as I am of troops [to       serve in putting down the Indian Mutiny], some great disaster       will take place if necessary funds are at the same time cut off       from me. I am sure, if the enormous reductions I have effected in       military expenditure are considered, the most rigid economists       will feel that the money paid by Great Britain for the control of       this country has been advantageously laid out.\"    These extracts are not pleasant reading. They were written at the time  when the Imperial spirit was at its nadir. In the plain language of  the Secretary of State for the Colonies[6] in 1858, it was a time when  ministers were \"compelled to recognise as fact the increased and  increasing dislike of Parliament to the maintenance of large military  establishments in our colonies at Imperial cost.\" Yet one more passage  must be cited, not so much because it is tinged by a certain grim  humour--although this is a valuable quality in such a context--as  because it affords an eminently pertinent illustration in support of  the contention that the refusal of the Home Government to follow the  advice of the \"man on the spot\" has been the operative cause of the  failure of British administration in South Africa. The reply to the  charge of \"direct disobedience,\" which Grey formulates in one  leisurely sentence, runs as follows:             [Footnote 6: Sir E. B. Lytton.]         \"With regard to any necessity which might exist for my removal on       the ground of not holding the same views upon essential points of       policy as Her Majesty's Government hold, I can only make the       general remark that, during the five years which have elapsed       since I was appointed to my present office, there have been at       least seven Secretaries of State for the Colonial Department,       each of whom held different views upon some important points of       policy connected with this country.\"    [Sidenote: The discovery of diamonds.]    Grey was not by any means the only Governor of the Cape to show the  home authorities how impossible it was to govern South Africa from  Downing Street, and to urge upon them the necessity of allowing their  representative, the one man who was familiar with local conditions, to  decide by what methods the objects of British policy could be most  effectively advanced. But it was not until some considerable time  after the Colonial Department had been placed under a separate  Secretary of State, and the Colonial Office had been constituted on  its present basis, with a staff of permanent officials, that these  protests produced any appreciable effect. What really aroused an  interest in South Africa--that is to say a practical interest, as  distinct from the interest created by the stories of missionary  enterprise and travel, and by the records of Kafir warfare--was the  discovery of diamonds in Griqualand West in 1870, and the subsequent  establishment of the diamond industry at Kimberley. It was the first  time that anything certain had occurred to show that the vast  \"hinterland\" of the Cape might prove to be a territory of industrial  possibilities. The earnings of the diamond mines provided the Cape  Colony with a revenue sufficient to enable it to link together its  main towns by a tolerable railway system. The industry, once  established, attracted British capital and British population, and by  so doing it did what Blue-books and missionary"]]]
