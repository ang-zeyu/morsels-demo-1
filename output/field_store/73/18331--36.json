Once he rubbed  his eyes as if to make sure he was awake, then he slowly stretched out  one hand toward the beautiful new sled, hardly daring to believe it was  real. Then suddenly, as the boys watched eagerly, the sled was in his  arms and he was jumping up and down with joy, calling to those of his  family who could, to come out to see the wonderful surprise.    \"Time for us to be getting home now,\" whispered Chuck, and Toad, feeling  very happy, answered:    \"I guess you're right.\"    By nine o'clock Chuck and Toad were sound asleep, and the stockings,  tied to the end of each bed, fell limp and empty.          CHAPTER IX    CHRISTMAS MORNING      \"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!\" shouted Toad.    It was seven o'clock and Chuck awoke with a start and looked around him.    \"Merry Christmas,\" he answered, and both boys scrambled down to the foot  of their beds to untie the stockings full to overflowing with candies,  nuts, oranges and many small gifts.    \"Oh!\" cried Chuck, \"see what I have,\" holding his stocking up by the  foot and shaking the contents out on the bed. \"A big knife, and a top,  and some reals.\"    \"So have I! By jinks, I'm glad to get the knife,--it's a beauty, three  blades!\"    Chuck, who by this time had a whole candy apple in his mouth, could only  nod his head in reply.    \"Let's hurry up and dress so we can go down to see the tree,\" proposed  Toad. \"I'll bet there will be lots more things for us down there,\" and  this the boys hastened to do.    \"Merry Christmas,\" greeted Mother Brown, a few minutes later, as the  boys, now fully dressed, came to her door.    \"Merry Christmas, boys,\" called their father from the hall below, as  Mother Brown and the boys hurried downstairs.    As they entered the library the very first thing that met Toad's eyes  was a beautiful new sled, much larger than the one he had given the  night before to Michael O'Reilly.    \"Oh, is that for me?\" he cried in delight as he pounced upon it. \"I  didn't expect to get one.\"    \"Yes, my son,\" answered his father, \"it is for you.\"    \"Oh, wait until Reddy sees this!\" and Toad fairly hopped about in his  delight.    Chuck was very much excited over a new building game, the very thing he  had hoped for, but Toad hardly had time to look at his other gifts from  his many aunts and uncles, so anxious was he to go out doors to try his  new sled.    After breakfast Mother Brown helped him into his coat and found his  mittens and cap, for they always seemed to run away and hide while Toad  slept.    \"Come on, Chuck!\" he cried. \"Aren't you coming out?\"    \"Nope, I'm going to see if I can build a derrick,\" was the reply, so  Toad started off alone.    As he reached the hill down which most of the boys liked best to coast,  he met Reddy, trudging along with his sled.    \"Hey, Merry Christmas,\" he shouted. \"Look at what Dad gave me!\"    \"Merry Christmas,\" answered Reddy. \"Jingoes, that's a beauty!\"    \"Did you get the football you wanted?\" he was asked.    \"You bet I did, and a punching bag, too.\"    \"Like the one in Daddy Williams' window?\" inquired Toad.    \"Just like it, and when you give it a punch, whack! it comes back at  you, quick as a flash.\"    \"What did Fat get?\"    \"Oh, a lot of books and a pair of ice skates,\" replied Reddy, \"so he's  gone over to White's pond to try them.\"    \"Chuck got his building game; you know, the one he wanted, and he  wouldn't come out,\" declared Toad in fine disgust. \"He's making things  with it.\"    \"Who's that just starting?\" and Reddy pointed up the long hill where  some one was getting ready to coast down. \"Well, if it isn't Mike  O'Reilly!\" he exclaimed,--\"here ahead of us.\"    Then, as the sled with Mike lying flat on it shot past them, they  greeted him with a shout.    \"Hello,\" returned Mike, his face all aglow with joy, \"look at what I got  for Christmas.\"    \"Bet you're glad now that you gave it to him,\" said Reddy as the two  boys reached the top of the hill. \"Let me go down with you the first  trip?\"    \"You bet!\" Toad assented.    \"Merry Christmas,\" Reddy shouted, giving the sled a push from behind.  \"One, two, three, we're off,\" and down they flew.    \"She's speedy, all right,\" he declared as the cold north wind stung his  cheeks.    \"And she steers like a bird,\" echoed Toad.

This made Cain very angry and his face showed it. So Jehovah said to  Cain, \"Why are you angry and why do you scowl? If you do what is right  and good, will not your offering be accepted? But if you do wrong, sin  crouches like a wild beast at the door and the desire to sin will  overcome you; but you should master it.\"    Cain said to his brother Abel, \"Let us go into the field.\" And while  they were in the field, Cain struck his brother Abel and killed him.    When Jehovah said to Cain, \"Where is your brother Abel?\" Cain answered,  \"I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?\" Jehovah said, \"What have you  done? Hark! your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. Even  now you are condemned by the very ground that has opened to receive your  brother's blood from your hand. Whenever you till the ground, it shall  no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a tramp and a wanderer  on the earth.\"    Then Cain said to Jehovah, \"My punishment is more than I can bear. See,  thou hast driven me out to-day from this land, and I shall no longer be  able to worship thee; I shall become a tramp and a wanderer on the  earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\"    But Jehovah said to him, \"If any one kills you, he shall be punished  sevenfold.\" So Jehovah placed a mark on Cain, to keep any one who found  him from killing him. And Cain went out from Jehovah's presence and  lived as a wanderer, away from Eden.          NOAH AND THE GREAT FLOOD      When Jehovah saw that men were growing more wicked in the world and that  their thoughts were always evil, he was greatly grieved and regretted  that he had made man. Therefore, Jehovah said, \"I will completely  destroy all living beings from off the earth, for I regret that I have  made them.\"    But Noah had won Jehovah's favor. So Jehovah said to Noah, \"I have  decided to put an end to all living beings, for the earth is filled with  their wicked acts. I am going to destroy them from the earth. Make  yourself an ark of cypress wood. Build rooms in the ark, and cover it  within and without with pitch. This is how you shall build it: the ark  shall be five hundred feet long, eighty feet wide, and fifty feet high.  Make a roof for it and place the door on the side. Build it with lower,  second, and third stories. For I am about to bring floods of water upon  the earth to destroy every living creature in which is the breath of  life. Every creature that is on the earth shall die.\"    Then Jehovah said to Noah, \"Enter with all your household into the ark,  for I see that of all the people who are now alive you alone are  upright. Of all the beasts that are fit for food and sacrifice you shall  take with you seven, the male and the female; but of the beasts that are  not fit for food and sacrifice two, the male and the female; and of the  wild birds that are fit for food and sacrifice seven, to keep each kind  alive on all the earth. After seven days I will send rain on the earth  for forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy every living thing  that I have made.\"    Then Noah did all that Jehovah commanded him. When the waters of the  flood came upon the earth, he, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives,  together with the beasts that were fit for food and sacrifice and the  beasts that were not fit, and the birds, and everything that creeps upon  the ground, entered the ark because of the waters of the flood.    The rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and Jehovah  shut Noah in the ark. And the waters rose higher and higher and raised  up the ark, and it was lifted high above the earth. All creatures living  on the land died. Noah only was left and they who were with him in the  ark.    Then God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the animals that  were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to blow over the earth,  and the flood went down, the rain from heaven ceased, and the waters  withdrew more and more from the land.    After forty days Noah opened the window of the ark and sent out a raven;  and it kept going to and fro until the waters were dried up on the  earth. He also sent out a dove to see if the waters had gone from the  surface of the earth. But the dove found no rest for her foot, and so  returned to him to the ark, for the waters covered the whole earth.  Therefore, Noah reached out his hand and took her and brought her back  into the ark.    Then he waited seven days longer and again sent out the dove from the  ark. And the dove came in to him at dusk; and in her mouth was a freshly  plucked olive-leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had gone from the  earth. And he waited seven days more and again sent out the dove, but it  did not return to him.    So Noah took off the covering of the ark and looked and saw that the  surface of the ground was dry. Then he, with his sons, his wife, and his  sons' wives, went out of the ark.    And Noah built an altar to Jehovah and took one of every beast and bird  that was fit for sacrifice and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. And  Jehovah said to himself, \"I will never again condemn the ground because  of man, nor will I again destroy every living creature, as I have done.  While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and  winter, day and night, shall not cease.\"    And God said, \"This is the sign of the solemn agreement that I make for  all time between me and you and every living creature that is with you:  I have placed my rainbow in the cloud and it shall be the sign of the  solemn agreement between me and the people who live on the earth.  Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth and the rainbow is seen in the  cloud, I will remember the agreement which is between me and you and  every living creature; and the waters shall never again become a flood  to destroy them.\"          THE STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL      All the people of the earth spoke one language; and as they travelled  westward, they found a broad valley in the land of Babylonia, and made  their home there.    Then they said one to another, \"Come, let us make bricks and thoroughly  bake them.\" So they had bricks for stone and asphalt for mortar. And  they said, \"Come, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top will  touch the heavens, and thus make a landmark, that we may not be  scattered over all the earth.\"    But when Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower men had built,  he said, \"See, they are one people and all have one language. This is  but the beginning, and now nothing which they plan to do will seem too  difficult for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language,  that they may not understand one another.\"    So Jehovah scattered them from there over all the earth; and they  stopped building the city. Therefore they named it Babel, which means  Confusion, for there Jehovah confused the language of all the people on  the earth and scattered them over the whole world.      ABRAHAM, THE FRIEND OF GOD AND MAN    The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth.  Terah, a descendant of Shem, was the father of Abraham, Nahor and Haran;  and Haran was the father of Lot.    Jehovah said to Abraham, \"Go from your country, your relatives, and your  father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you  a great nation; and I will surely bless you and make your name famous,  so that you shall be a blessing. And all the families of the earth shall  ask for themselves a blessing like your own.\"    So Abraham set out, as Jehovah had commanded him; and Lot went with him.  Abraham was seventy-five years old when he left Haran. He took Sarah his  wife and Lot his brother's son and everything that they had, and started  for the land of Canaan.    Abraham passed through the land to a place called Shechem, to the oak of  Moreh. There Jehovah appeared to Abraham and said, \"To your children  will I give this land.\" There Abraham built an altar to Jehovah who had  appeared to him. From there he removed to the hill near Bethel and  pitched his tent with Bethel on one side and Ai on the other, and there  too he built an altar to Jehovah and prayed to him.    Now Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold; Lot also,  who went with Abraham, had so many flocks and herds and tents that the  land was not rich enough to support them both. So when there was a  quarrel between Lot's herdsmen and Abraham's herdsmen, Abraham said to  Lot, \"I beg of you, let there be no quarrel between me and you, nor  between my herdsmen and yours, for we are relatives. Is not the whole  land before you? I beg of you, separate yourself from me. If you go to  the left, then I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, then I  will go to the left.\"    [Illustration: _Building the Tower of Babel_    Painted by J. James Tissot]    So Lot looked about and saw that all the plain of the Jordan, as far as  Zoar, was well watered everywhere, like a garden of Jehovah. So Lot  chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and lived in the  cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom. But the men of  Sodom were very wicked and sinned against Jehovah.    Jehovah said to Abraham, after Lot had gone away from him, \"Lift up your  eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward,  eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you  and to your children forever. I will make them as many as the dust of  the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your  children may also be counted. Rise, walk through the length and breadth  of the land, for I will give it to you.\"    Then Abraham moved his tent and lived in the oak grove of Mamre, which  is in Hebron, and built there an altar to Jehovah.    Jehovah also appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he was sitting  at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day;"]]]
