He had to tilt across it and  catch the brass knob--like snatching a ring in a high dive.    No danger now, except sitting down in a growing puddle till someone came  along to hoist him under the armpits, and then arriving at the general's  late, with his seat black-wet.... You unhorse your foeman, curvet up to  the royal box to receive the victor's chaplet, swing from your saddle,  and fall flat on your face.    But, he cogitated on the bench inside, getting his other cleat off and  the tip back on his stick, things do even out. No hearty helper had  intervened, no snot-nosed, gaping child had twitched his attention,  nobody's secretary--pretty of course--had scurried to helpfully knock  him down with the door. They were all out front superintending arrival  of the computer.           *       *       *       *       *    The general said only, if tartly, \"Oh yes, major, come in. You're late,  a'n't you?\"    \"It's still icy,\" said Ed Scott. \"Had to drive carefully, you know.\"    In fact, he _had_ lost minutes that way, enough to have saved his exact  deadline. And that excuse, being in proportion to Filipson's standard  dimension, was fair game.           *       *       *       *       *    I wondered what dimension Clyde would go on to, now that the challenge  of war was past. To his rebels refuge at last maybe? Does it matter?  Whatever it is, life will be outclassed, and Scott-Esterbrook's brand of  life will fight back.

As the man came abreast, he opened his lips and closed them twice before  passing on, and in the sultry stillness of the sleepy place they heard  him give a faint sigh.    \"Doesn't look much like a beggar,\" said Dean.  \"He's had a fever, or  something.\"    \"Well, I shouldn't like to have a fever here,\" said Mark.  \"I don't mean  to be ill.  If I am it's because I have come to a place where there's  nothing to do and nothing to see.  Oh, I am disappointed!  Here he comes  back again.  He must be a beggar, and he's ashamed to ask us to give him  something.  No, it can't be that.  For foreign beggars are not ashamed  to beg.  I shall ask him if he has been ill.\"    \"No, don't.  He mightn't like it,\" said Dean.    \"Then he will have to dislike it.\"    \"Don't talk so loud,\" whispered Dean, for the sailor passed close to  them again, looking from one to the other wistfully.    \"Poor beggar!\" said Mark, as the man passed on.  \"I am sure he is a  beggar, and he's too stupid and drowsy to beg.\"    \"'Tisn't that,\" said Dean.  \"He wants a job.\"    \"Well, that means he wants money.  _Hola_!\"    The man stopped and looked round eagerly, and the boys could see that  his lips were quivering as he made a movement with his hand as if in  salute.    \"_Dinheiro_,\" continued Mark, slapping his pocket.    \"Ah, gentlemen, then you are English?\"    \"Rather!\" said Mark.  \"Are you hard up in this sleepy place?\"    \"Yes, sir--no, sir,\" cried the man hastily.    \"What is it, then?  Do you want a job?\"  And Mark drew out a shilling.    \"Yes, sir; badly, sir.\"    \"Well, have you got a boat?\"    \"No, sir; I wish I had.  No, sir; thank you, sir.  I did not mean that;\"  and the man thrust his hands deeply into his pockets, while Mark thrust  his out of sight as well, shilling and all, and somehow his cheeks felt  a little hotter than before, as he felt that he had made a mistake.    \"I thought you wanted to take us for a row.\"    \"Oh no, sir.\"    \"Then what are you doing here in this out-of-the-way place?\"    \"Ask him where his ship is,\" whispered Dean.    \"Yes, that's it.  Do you belong to some ship in the harbour?\"    \"No, sir.  She sailed away three months ago.  I was too bad to go away  with her.  Fever, gentlemen.\"    \"Oh, that's bad,\" said Mark.  \"Sick in a strange place.\"    \"Oh, I haven't got anything to grumble at, sir.  The consul's been very  good to me; but I am as weak as a rat, sir, and--and--\"    The poor fellow's voice during the last few words had trailed off, and  ended in silence, while the two boys looked at him sympathetically and  felt very uncomfortable.    \"I shall be better directly, gentlemen,\" he said at last, with quite a  gasp; and then with an effort he went on, \"I beg pardon, but I heard of  you.  Someone told me about a party of English gentlemen going up the  country towards the mountains where a fellow could shake off the fever.  I can't get on, gentlemen--so weak.  Better directly.\"    \"All right,\" said Mark.  \"Take your time.\"    \"Thank you, sir.  I thought you were going away.  It ain't catching,  sir.\"    \"Nobody thought it was,\" said Mark.  \"Here, let's walk on down towards  the waterside.\"    \"Thank you, sir.  There, I can get on now.  I heard about you gentlemen,  and I thought I would make bold enough to ask you to take me with you.  Sailor, sir,\" he continued, turning to Dean.  \"Turn my hand to anything,  sir.  Make myself useful.  Consul said that a turn up in the mountains  would put me right in no time.  Make me strong to get a ship again.  I  arn't begging, sir.  Look here, gentlemen,\" and he pulled one of his  hands out of his pocket half full of silver.    \"I say, Dean,\" said Mark, \"what are we to do?\"    Dean shook his head helplessly.  \"We can't take him: we've got two men  already.\"    \"I say, look here,\" said Mark; \"I can't do as I like, but I will ask my  father, and I daresay he will pay your passage home to England.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said the man, with a sigh, and he shook his head  sadly, \"but I don't think I should live to get there.\"    \"Oh, don't talk like that!\" cried Dean, and he looked so appealingly at  the man that the poor fellow smiled.    \"All right, sir, I won't.  They say drowning men catch at straws.  I'm  kind of drowning like, and when I hears as you gentlemen were going up  the country, something seemed to say to me, try 'em, mate; it can't do  no harm.  And when I see you two young gents I tried to speak, but  somehow I couldn't, and now I have--well, I have asked you, and you  can't, and I might have made sure of it before.\"    \"But you see--\" began Dean.    \"Yes, sir, I understand,\" said the man.  \"Thank you all the same, and  good luck to you both.\"    He turned quickly and walked feebly away, the two boys watching him,  both feeling that they must call him back; but somehow no words came.    \"Oh, Dean,\" cried Mark, at last, \"how I do hate this place!  Just as if  it wasn't miserable and disappointing enough before!  If that poor  fellow were not so bad I feel as if I should like to kick him for coming  and telling us about how ill he had been.  Just as if it was our fault!  It is enough to make one turn ill oneself.  Here, let's go in out of  this broiling heat or you will be going and catching sunstroke just out  of spite.\"    \"Likely!\" said Dean bitterly.    \"Now, don't you turn disagreeable.  I know what you are thinking.\"    \"What?\" cried Dean, in surprise.    \"You are thinking that I might ask father to go to the expense of taking  that poor fellow up the country.  Why, he'd think I was mad.\"    \"I'd take him if I had got the money,\" said Dean.    \"So would I if I had got the money,\" retorted Mark, \"but I haven't.  Oh,  there are our two chaps again,\" cried the boy eagerly, as if glad to get  away from the unpleasant subject.  \"They can see us, and are coming.\"    The two gamekeepers came strolling up, and Dance saluted them with,  \"Nice day, gentlemen!  Pity we arn't got some of it at home.  Shouldn't  want no coke for the old vinery.\"    \"No,\" said Mark shortly.  \"Well, what do you think of an African port?\"    \"Don't think nothing on it, sir.  Do you, mate?\"    \"Think it's a fine place to get away from,\" replied his companion  grinning uncomfortably.  \"Say, Mr Mark, don't you wish you was at  home?\"    \"Oh, don't talk nonsense!\" cried Mark angrily.  \"What's the use of  saying things like that?  We wanted to come, and we have come.\"    \"But we are not going to stop here long, are we, Mr Mark, sir?\"    \"No, not long.  Certainly not a week.\"    \"That's a comfort, sir, because Peter Dance and me have been thinking  that we should like to go and ask the gov'nor if he would send us back.\"    \"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourselves!\" snapped out Dean, upon  whom the scorching sun seemed to have the effect of taking the skin off  his temper.    \"Well, I don't know about Bob here, sir, but I do feel that I was a fool  for wanting to come,\" said the keeper.    \"Then you would both go,\" cried Mark angrily, \"and leave us in the lurch  just because you don't like this place?\"    \"Well, I put it to you, Mr Mark, sir,\" said Bob, \"speaking as  gamekeepers, we thought we was coming out here to a beautiful country  where it was going to be shooting all day long.  And just look about  you!  Don't it look as if it was the last place that was ever made?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Mark shortly, \"but I didn't expect that you two  would have played the sneak as soon as there was a little trouble.\"    \"Who's a-going to, Mr Mark, sir?\" said Bob gruffly.  \"You asked us how  we liked Africa, and we only as good as said we didn't like it a tiny  bit.  We arn't a-going to play the sneak; are we, Peter?\"    \"Not us,\" grunted Dance.  \"I shouldn't like to go and tell Sir James  that; should you, Bob?\"    \"No-o!\"    \"Come along, Dean,\" said Mark, turning from the men; and the boys walked  away.  \"Let's get indoors.  I don't know what's come to me; I feel as if  I could quarrel with everybody.  Let's go in and see if father's awake  yet.\"    \"Why, you can't quarrel with him,\" said Dean, staring in wonder at his  cousin.    \"Well, who said I could, stupid?  Do you want to make me quarrel with  you?\"    \"Yes, if you like.  I feel as if a nice row would do me good.  I'm  miserable.  It's been a wretched voyage, bad weather all the time, and  uncle cross, and the doctor wishing--I could see he was--nearly all the  time, that he had never said a word about travelling; and now after  longing to get to land we have been set down here.\"    \"Well,\" said Mark, \"you are a nice fellow to try and cheer one up!  I  had just said a word or two about how wretched I was and how I felt, and  then you begin quarrelling.\"        CHAPTER FOUR.    ALL IN TO BEGIN.    The first words which saluted the boys were from Sir James:    \"Why don't you start your sun helmets?\"    \"Not unpacked, father.  You said--\"    \"Oh, never mind what I said, boy, but get them out as soon as you can; a  straw hat, as the doctor has just been saying, is no protection here; is  it, doctor?\"    \"Certainly not, sir; but we shall not feel the heat so much as soon as  we leave here, for the country rises.\"    \"Pretty country!\" said Sir James sarcastically.  \"But you boys, who was  that rough looking sailor you picked up with?\"    \"We didn't pick up with him, father,\" said Mark sourly.    \"What, sir!  Don't tell me that!  I distinctly saw you with him out of  the window.\"    \"He picked up with us, father--\" began Mark; and then he caught the  doctor's eye and changed his lone, saying hastily, \"He was a poor fellow  in distress, father.\"    Here Mark stopped short, for he had returned to the hotel with the full  intention of pleading the poor invalid's cause, and he felt that he had  commenced by speaking in a way that must increase his father's  irritation, for Sir James had been quite upset by the heat of the place  and the discomforts of the miserable hotel to which he had been directed  when on board the liner as being"]]]
