The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the  entry:  acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish  and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid  rain).  acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly  to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH  scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered  alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note  - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in  New England.  aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke,  or fog.  afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting  trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that  have been cut or destroyed by fire.  asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in  fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in  particulate form.  biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.  bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance,  and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.  biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area  or volume.  carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in  various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean,  terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.  catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited  freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.  DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was  banned in the US in 1972.  defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.  deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,  and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without  planting new growth.  desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-  arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive  soils, or climate change.  dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,  shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.  drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally  anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an  over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine  species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the ocean clean\".  ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of  organisms and their specific environments.  effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste  which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.  endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.  freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.  greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the lower  atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary  greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.  groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often  in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source  for wells and natural springs.  Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly  and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it  forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders  economic resources.  Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 145,000 Inuits of  Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental  issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the  focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of  pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.  metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.  noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.  overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it  can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.  ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.  poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with  respect to endangered or threatened species.  pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.  potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.  salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes  salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process;  also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by  evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.  siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted  with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.  slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which  trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary  agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which  point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is  sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for  regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do  not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the  environment .  soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because of  poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or  fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of  topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce  agricultural products.  soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2757"],[0,"Vaninka (#4)"],[1,"the  French outposts having the slightest suspicion of what was taking place.    Surprised at two o'clock in the morning by two Austrian divisions,  which, concealed by the village of San Gervasio, had reached the right  bank of the Adda without their being discovered, the soldiers defending  the castle of Trezzo abandoned it and beat a retreat. The Austrians  pursued them as far as Pozzo, but there the French suddenly halted and  faced about, for General Serrurier was at Pozzo, with the troops he had  brought from Lecco. He heard the cannonade behind him, immediately  halted, and, obeying the first law of warfare, he marched towards the  noise and smoke. It was therefore through him that the garrison of  Trezzo rallied and resumed the offensive. Serrurier sent an aide-de-Camp  to Moreau to inform him of the manoeuvre he had thought proper to  execute.    The battle between the French and Austrian troops raged with incredible  fury. Bonaparte's veterans, during their first Italian campaigns, had  adopted a custom which they could not renounce: it was to fight His  Imperial Majesty's subjects wherever they found them. Nevertheless, so  great was the numerical superiority of the allies, that our troops had  begun to retreat, when loud shouts from the rearguard announced that  reinforcements had arrived. It was General Grenier, sent by Moreau, who  arrived with his division at the moment when his presence was most  necessary.    One part of the new division reinforced the centre column, doubling its  size; another part was extended upon the left to envelop the enemy. The  drums beat afresh down the whole line, and our grenadiers began again to  reconquer this battle field already twice lost and won. But at this  moment the Austrians were reinforced by the Marquis de Chasteler and his  division, so that the numerical superiority was again with the enemy.  Grenier drew back his wing to strengthen the centre, and Serrurier,  preparing for retreat in case of disaster, fell back on Pozzo, where he  awaited the enemy. It was here that the battle raged most fiercely:  thrice the village of Pozzo was taken and re-taken, until at last,  attacked for the fourth time by a force double their own in numbers, the  French were obliged to evacuate it. In this last attack an Austrian  colonel was mortally wounded, but, on the other hand, General Beker, who  commanded the French rearguard, refused to retreat with his soldiers,  and maintained his ground with a few men, who were slain as they stood;  he was at length obliged to give up his sword to a young Russian officer  of the Semenofskoi regiment, who, handing over his prisoner to his own  soldiers, returned immediately to the combat.    The two French generals had fixed on the village of Vaprio as a  rallying-place, but at the moment when our troops were thrown into  disorder through the evacuation of Pozzo, the Austrian cavalry charged  heavily, and Serrurier, finding himself separated from his colleague,  was obliged to retire with two thousand five hundred men to Verderio,  whilst Grenier, having reached the appointed place, Vaprio, halted to  face the enemy afresh.    During this time a terrible fight was taking place in the centre. Melas  with eighteen to twenty thousand men had attacked the fortified posts at  the head of the bridge of Cassano and the Ritorto Canal. About seven  o'clock in the morning, when Moreau had weakened himself by despatching  Grenier and his division, Melas, leading three battalions of Austrian  grenadiers, had attacked the fortifications, and for two hours there was  terrible carnage; thrice repulsed, and leaving more than fifteen hundred  men at the base of the fortifications, the Austrians had thrice returned  to the attack, each time being reinforced by fresh troops, always led on  and encouraged by Melas, who had to avenge his former defeats. At  length, having been attacked for the fourth time, forced from their  entrenchments, and contesting the ground inch by inch, the French took  shelter behind their second fortifications, which defended the entrance  to the bridge itself: here they were commanded by Moreau in person.  There, for two more hours, a hand-to-hand struggle took place, whilst  the terrible artillery belched forth death almost muzzle to muzzle. At  last the Austrians, rallying for a last time, advanced at the point of  the bayonet, and; lacking either ladders or fascines, piled the bodies  of their dead comrades against the fortifications, and succeeded in  scaling the breastworks. There was not a moment to be lost. Moreau  ordered a retreat, and whilst the French were recrossing the Adda, he  protected their passage in person with a single battalion of grenadiers,  of whom at the end of half an hour not more than a hundred and twenty  men remained; three of his aides-de-camp were killed at his side. This  retreat was accomplished without disorder, and then Moreau himself  retired, still fighting the enemy, who set foot on the bridge as soon as  he reached the other bank. The Austrians immediately rushed forward to  capture him, when suddenly a terrible noise was heard rising above the  roar of the artillery; the second arch of the bridge was blown into the  air, carrying with it all those who were standing on the fatal spot. The  armies recoiled, and into the empty space between them fell like rain a  debris of stones and human beings. But at this moment, when Moreau had  succeeded in putting a momentary obstacle between himself and Melas,  General Grenier's division arrived in disorder, after having been forced  to evacuate Vaprio, pursued by the Austro-Russians under Zopf, Ott, and  Chasteler. Moreau ordered a change of front, and faced this new enemy,  who fell upon him when he least expected them; he succeeded in rallying  Grenier's troops and in re-establishing the battle. But whilst his back  was turned Melas repaired the bridge and crossed the river; thus Moreau  found himself attacked frontally, in the rear, and on his two flanks, by  forces three times larger than his own. It was then that all the  officers who surrounded him begged him to retreat, for on the  preservation of his person depended the preservation of Italy for  France. Moreau refused for some time, for he knew the awful consequences  of the battle he had just lost, and he did not wish to survive it,  although it had been impossible for him to win it. At last a chosen band  surrounded him, and, forming a square, drew back, whilst the rest of the  army sacrificed themselves to cover his retreat; for Moreau's genius was  looked upon as the sole hope that remained to them.    The battle lasted nearly three hours longer, during which the rearguard  of the army performed prodigies of valour. At length Melas, seeing that  the enemy had escaped him, and believing that his troops, tired by the  stubborn fight, needed rest, gave orders that the fighting should cease.  He halted on the left bank of the Adda, encamping his army in the  villages of Imago, Gorgonzola, and Cassano, and remained master of the  battlefield, upon which we had left two thousand five hundred dead, one  hundred pieces of cannon, and twenty howitzers.    That night Souvarow invited General Becker to supper with him, and asked  him by whom he had been taken prisoner. Becker replied that it was a  young officer belonging to the regiment which had first entered Pozzo.  Souvarow immediately inquired what regiment this was, and discovered  that it was the Semenofskoi; he then ordered that inquiries should be  made to ascertain the young officer's name. Shortly afterwards  Sub-Lieutenant Foedor Romayloff was announced. He presented General  Becker's sword to Souvarow, who invited him to remain and to have supper  with his prisoner.    Next day Foedor wrote to his protector: \"I have kept my word. I am a  lieutenant, and Field-Marshal Souvarow has requested his Majesty Paul I  to bestow upon me the order of Saint Vladimir.\"    On 28th of April, Souvarow entered Milan, which Moreau had just  abandoned in order to retreat beyond Tesino. The following proclamation  was by his order posted on all the walls of the capital; it admirably  paints the spirit of the Muscovite:    \"The victorious army of the Apostolical and Roman Emperor is here; it  has fought solely for the restoration of the Holy Faith,--the clergy,  nobility, and ancient government of Italy. People, join us for God and  the Faith, for we have arrived with an army at Milan and Placentia to  assist you!\"    The dearly bought victories of Trebia and Novi succeeded that of  Cassano, and left Souvarow so much weakened that he was unable to profit  by them. Besides, just when the Russian general was about to resume his  march, a new plan of campaign arrived, sent by the Aulic Council at  Vienna. The Allied Powers had decided upon the invasion of France, and  had fixed the route each general must follow in order to accomplish this  new project. It way decided that Souvarow should invade France by  Switzerland, and that the arch-duke should yield him his positions and  descend on the Lower Rhine.    The troops with which Souvarow was to operate against Massena from this  time were the thirty thousand Russians he had with him, thirty thousand  others detached from the reserve army commanded by Count Tolstoy in  Galicia, who were to be led to join him in Switzerland by General  Korsakoff, about thirty thousand Austrians under General Hotze, and  lastly, five or six thousand French emigrants under the Prince de Conde  in all, an army of ninety or ninety-five thousand men. The Austrians  were to oppose Moreau and Macdonald.    Foedor had been wounded when entering Novi, but Souvarow had rewarded  him with a second cross, and the rank of captain hastened his  convalescence, so that the young officer, more happy than proud of the  new rank he had received, was in a condition to follow the army, when on  13th September it moved towards Salvedra"]]]
