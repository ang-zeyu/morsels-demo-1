And, of course, everybody blamed it  all on Ludovick--even that year's run of bad weather.    There were famines, riots, plagues, and, after the waves of mob hostility  had coalesced into national groupings, wars. It was like the old days  again, precisely as described in the textbooks.    In the second place, Ludovick could never forget that, when Corisande  had sent him to the Blue Tower, she could not have been sure that her  secret weapon would work. Love might _not_ have conquered all--in fact,  it was the more likely hypothesis that it wouldn't--and he would have  been killed by the first barrier. And no husband likes to think that  his wife thinks he's expendable; it makes him feel she doesn't really  love him.    So, in thirtieth year of his reign as Dictator of Earth, Ludovick  poisoned Corisande--that is, had her poisoned, for by now he had a  Minister of Assassination to handle such little matters--and married  a very pretty, very young, very affectionate blonde. He wasn't  particularly happy with her, either, but at least it was a change.      --EVELYN E."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23169"],[0,"The Diamond Lens (#4)"],[1,"so beautiful. All the glories  of light ever imagined or described seemed to pulsate in its crystalline  chambers. Its weight, as I learned from Simon, was exactly one hundred  and forty carats. Here was an amazing coincidence. The hand of destiny  seemed in it. On the very evening when the spirit of Leeuwenhoek  communicates to me the great secret of the microscope, the priceless  means which he directs me to employ start up within my easy reach! I  determined, with the most perfect deliberation, to possess myself of  Simon's diamond.    I sat opposite to him while he nodded over his glass, and calmly  revolved the whole affair. I did not for an instant contemplate so  foolish an act as a common theft, which would of course be discovered,  or at least necessitate flight and concealment, all of which must  interfere with my scientific plans. There was but one step to be  taken--to kill Simon. After all, what was the life of a little peddling  Jew in comparison with the interests of science? Human beings are taken  every day from the condemned prisons to be experimented on by surgeons.  This man, Simon, was by his own confession a criminal, a robber, and I  believed on my soul a murderer. He deserved death quite as much as any  felon condemned by the laws: why should I not, like government,  contrive that his punishment should contribute to the progress of human  knowledge?    The means for accomplishing everything I desired lay within my reach.  There stood upon the mantelpiece a bottle half full of French laudanum.  Simon was so occupied with his diamond, which I had just restored to  him, that it was an affair of no difficulty to drug his glass. In a  quarter of an hour he was in a profound sleep.    I now opened his waistcoat, took the diamond from the inner pocket in  which he had placed it, and removed him to the bed, on which I laid him  so that his feet hung down over the edge. I had possessed myself of  the Malay creese, which I held in my right hand, while with the other I  discovered as accurately as I could by pulsation the exact locality of  the heart. It was essential that all the aspects of his death should  lead to the surmise of self-murder. I calculated the exact angle at  which it was probable that the weapon, if leveled by Simon's own hand,  would enter his breast; then with one powerful blow I thrust it up to  the hilt in the very spot which I desired to penetrate. A convulsive  thrill ran through Simon's limbs. I heard a smothered sound issue from  his throat, precisely like the bursting of a large air-bubble sent up by  a diver when it reaches the surface of the water; he turned half round  on his side, and, as if to assist my plans more effectually, his right  hand, moved by some mere spasmodic impulse, clasped the handle of the  creese, which it remained holding with extraordinary muscular tenacity.  Beyond this there was no apparent struggle. The laudanum, I presume,  paralyzed the usual nervous action. He must have died instantly.    There was yet something to be done. To make it certain that all  suspicion of the act should be diverted from any inhabitant of the house  to Simon himself, it was necessary that the door should be found in the  morning _locked on the in-side_. How to do this, and afterward escape  myself? Not by the window; that was a physical impossibility. Besides,  I was determined that the windows _also_ should be found bolted. The  solution was simple enough. I descended softly to my own room for  a peculiar instrument which I had used for holding small slippery  substances, such as minute spheres of glass, etc. This instrument was  nothing more than a long, slender hand-vise, with a very powerful grip  and a considerable leverage, which last was accidentally owing to the  shape of the handle. Nothing was simpler than, when the key was in the  lock, to seize the end of its stem in this vise, through the keyhole,  from the outside, and so lock the door. Previously, however, to doing  this, I burned a number of papers on Simon's hearth. Suicides almost  always burn papers before they destroy themselves. I also emptied some  more laudanum into Simon's glass--having first removed from it all  traces of wine--cleaned the other wine-glass, and brought the bottles  away with me. If traces of two persons drinking had been found in the  room, the question naturally would have arisen, Who was the second?  Besides, the wine-bottles might have been identified as belonging to me.  The laudanum I poured out to account for its presence in his stomach, in  case of a _post-mortem_ examination. The theory naturally would be that  he first intended to poison himself, but, after swallowing a little of  the drug, was either disgusted with its taste, or changed his mind from  other motives, and chose the dagger. These arrangements made, I walked  out, leaving the gas burning, locked the door with my vise, and went to  bed.    Simon's death was not discovered until nearly three in the afternoon.  The servant, astonished at seeing the gas burning--the light streaming  on the dark landing from under the door--peeped through the keyhole and  saw Simon on the bed.    She gave the alarm. The door was burst open, and the neighborhood was in  a fever of excitement.    Every one in the house was arrested, myself included. There was an  inquest; but no clew to his death beyond that of suicide could be  obtained. Curiously enough, he had made several speeches to his friends  the preceding week that seemed to point to self-destruction. One  gentleman swore that Simon had said in his presence that \"he was tired  of life.\" His landlord affirmed that Simon, when paying him his last  month's rent, remarked that \"he should not pay him rent much longer.\"  All the other evidence corresponded--the door locked inside, the  position of the corpse, the burned papers. As I anticipated, no one  knew of the possession of the diamond by Simon, so that no motive was  suggested for his murder. The jury, after a prolonged examination,  brought in the usual verdict, and the neighborhood once more settled  down to its accustomed quiet.          V    The three months succeeding Simon's catastrophe I devoted night and day  to my diamond lens. I had constructed a vast galvanic battery, composed  of nearly two thousand pairs of plates: a higher power I dared not use,  lest the diamond should be calcined. By means of this enormous engine  I was enabled to send a powerful current of electricity continually  through my great diamond, which it seemed to me gained in lustre every  day. At the expiration of a month I commenced the grinding and polishing  of the lens, a work of intense toil and exquisite delicacy. The great  density of the stone, and the care required to be taken with the  curvatures of the surfaces of the lens, rendered the labor the severest  and most harassing that I had yet undergone.    At last the eventful moment came; the lens was completed. I stood  trembling on the threshold of new worlds. I had the realization of  Alexander's famous wish before me. The lens lay on the table, ready to  be placed upon its platform. My hand fairly shook as I enveloped a drop  of water with a thin coating of oil of turpentine, preparatory to  its examination, a process necessary in order to prevent the rapid  evaporation of the water. I now placed the drop on a thin slip of glass  under the lens, and throwing upon it, by the combined aid of a prism and  a mirror, a powerful stream of light, I approached my eye to the minute  hole drilled through the axis of the lens. For an instant I saw nothing  save what seemed to be an illuminated chaos, a vast, luminous abyss. A  pure white light, cloudless and serene, and seemingly limitless as space  itself, was my first impression. Gently, and with the greatest care, I  depressed the lens a few hairbreadths. The wondrous illumination  still continued, but as the lens approached the object a scene of  indescribable beauty was unfolded to my view.    I seemed to gaze upon a vast space, the limits of which extended far  beyond my vision. An atmosphere of magical luminousness permeated the  entire field of view. I was amazed to see no trace of animalculous  life. Not a living thing, apparently, inhabited that dazzling expanse.  I comprehended instantly that, by the wondrous power of my lens, I had  penetrated beyond the grosser particles of aqueous matter, beyond the  realms of infusoria and protozoa, down to the original gaseous globule,  into whose luminous interior I was gazing as into an almost boundless  dome filled with a supernatural radiance.    It was, however, no brilliant void into which I looked. On every side I  beheld beautiful inorganic forms, of unknown texture, and colored with  the most enchanting hues. These forms presented the appearance of what  might be called, for want of a more specific definition, foliated clouds  of the highest rarity--that is, they undulated and broke into vegetable  formations, and were tinged with splendors compared with which the  gilding of our autumn woodlands is as dross compared with gold. Far away  into the illimitable distance stretched long avenues of these gaseous  forests, dimly transparent, and painted with prismatic hues of  unimaginable brilliancy. The pendent branches waved along the fluid  glades until every vista seemed to break through half-lucent ranks of  many-colored drooping silken pennons. What seemed to be either fruits or  flowers, pied with a thousand hues, lustrous and ever-varying, bubbled  from the crowns of this fairy foliage. No hills, no lakes, no rivers,  no forms animate or inanimate, were to be seen, save those vast auroral  copses that floated serenely in the luminous stillness, with leaves and  fruits and flowers gleaming with unknown fires, unrealizable by mere  imagination.    How strange, I thought, that this sphere should be thus condemned to  solitude! I had hoped, at least, to discover some new"]]]
