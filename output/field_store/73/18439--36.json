All became fertile after a single impregnation;  however, we have remarked some essential peculiarities in the fecundity  of those unimpregnated until the twentieth day of their existence; but  we shall defer speaking of the fact until we can present naturalists  with observations sufficiently secure and numerous to merit their  attention: Yet let me add a few words more. Though neither my assistant  nor myself have witnessed the copulation of a queen and a drone, we  think that, after the detail which has just been commenced, no doubt of  it can remain, or of the necessity of copulation to effect impregnation.  The sequel of experiments, made with every possible precaution, appears  demonstrative. The uniform sterility of queens in hives wanting males,  and in those where they were confined along with them; the departure of  these queens from the hives; and the very conspicuous evidence of  impregnation with which they return, are proofs against which no  objections can stand. But we do not despair of being able next spring to  obtain the complement of this proof, by seizing the female at the very  moment of copulation.    Naturalists have always been very much embarrassed to account for the  number of males found in most hives, and which seem only a burden on the  community, since they fulfil no function. But we now begin to discern  the object of nature in multiplying them to that extent. As fecundation  cannot be accomplished within, and as the queen is obliged to traverse  the expanse of the atmosphere, it is requisite the males should be  numerous that she may have the chance of meeting some one of them. Were  only two or three drones in each hive, there would be little probability  of their departure at the same instant with the queen, or that they  would meet in their excursions; and most of the females would thus  remain sterile.    But why has nature prohibited copulation within the hives? This is a  secret still unknown to us. It is possible, however, that some  favourable circumstance may enable us to penetrate it in the course of  our observations. Various conjectures may be formed; but at this day we  require facts, and reject gratuitous suppositions. It should be  remembered, that bees do not form the sole republic among insects  presenting a similar phenomenon; female ants are also obliged to leave  the ant-hills previous to fecundation.    I cannot request, Sir, that you will communicate the reflections which  your genius will excite concerning the facts I have related. This is a  favour to which I am not yet entitled. But as new experiments will  unquestionably occur to you, whether on the impregnation of the queen or  on other points, may I solicit you to suggest them? They shall be  executed with all possible care; and I shall esteem this mark of  friendship and interest as the most flattering encouragement that the  continuance of my labours can receive.      _Pregny, 13th August 1789._           *       *       *       *       *    _Letter from M. Bonnet to M. Huber._    You have most agreeably surprised me, Sir, with your interesting  discovery of the impregnation of the queen bee. It was a fortunate idea,  that she left the hive to be fecundated, and your method of ascertaining  the fact was extremely judicious and well adapted to the object in view.    Let me remind you, that male and female ants copulate in the air; and  that after impregnation the females return to the ant hills to deposit  their eggs. _Contemplation de la Nature, Part II. chap. 22. note 1._ It  would be necessary to seize the instant when the drone unites with the  female. But how remote from the power of the observer are the means of  ascertaining a copulation in the air. If you have satisfactory evidence  that the fluid bedewing the last rings of the female is the same with  that of the male, it is more than mere presumption in favour of  copulation. Perhaps it may be necessary that the male should seize the  female under the belly, which cannot easily be done but in the air. The  large opening at the extremity of the queen, which you have observed in  so particular a condition, seems to correspond to the singular size of  the sexual parts of the male.    You wish, my dear Sir, that I should suggest some new experiments on  these industrious republicans. In doing so, I shall take the greater  pleasure and interest, as I know to what extent you possess the valuable  art of combining ideas, and of deducing from this combination results  adapted to the discovery of new facts. A few at this moment occur to me.    It may be proper to attempt the artificial fecundation of a virgin  queen, by introducing a little of the male's prolific fluid with a  pencil, and at the same time observing every precaution to avoid error.  Artificial fecundation, you are aware, has already succeeded in more  than one animal.    To ascertain that the queen, which has left the hive for impregnation,  is the same that returns to deposit her eggs, you will find it necessary  to paint the thorax with some varnish that resists humidity. It will  also be right to paint the thorax of a considerable number of workers in  order to discover the duration of their life. This is a more secure  method than slight mutilations.    For hatching the worm, the egg must be fixed almost vertically by one  end near the bottom of the cell. Is it true, that it is unproductive  unless fixed in this manner? I cannot determine the fact; and therefore  leave it to the decision of experiment.    I formerly mentioned to you that I had long doubted the real nature of  the small ovular substances deposited by queens in the cells, and my  inclination to suppose them minute worms not yet begun to expand. Their  elongated figure seems to favour my suspicions. It would therefore be  proper to watch them with the utmost assiduity, from the instant of  production until the period of exclusion. If the integument bursts,  there can be no doubt that these minute substances are real eggs.    I return to the mode of operating copulation. The height that the queen  and the males rise to in the air prevent us from seeing what passes  between them. On that account, the hive should be put into an apartment  with a very lofty ceiling. M. de Reaumur's experiment of confining a  queen with several males in a glass vessel, merits repetition; and if,  instead of a vessel, a glass tube, some inches in diameter and several  feet long, were used, perhaps something satisfactory might be  discovered.    You have had the fortune to observe the small queens mentioned by the  Abbe Needham, but which he never saw. It will be of great importance to  dissect them for the purpose of finding their ovaries. When M. Reims  informed me that he had confined three hundred workers, along with a  comb containing no eggs, and afterwards found hundreds in it, I strongly  recommended that he should dissect the workers. He did so; and informed  me that eggs were found in three. Probably without being aware of it, he  has dissected small queens. As small drones exist, it is not surprising  if small queens are produced also, and undoubtedly by the same external  causes.    It is of much consequence to be intimately acquainted with this species  of queens, for they may have great influence on different experiments  and embarrass the observer: we should ascertain whether they inhabit  pyramidal cells smaller than the common, or hexagonal ones.    M. Schirach's famous experiment on the supposed conversion of a common  worm into a royal one, cannot be too often repeated, though the Lusatian  observers have already done it frequently. I could wish to learn  whether, as the discoverer maintains, the experiment will succeed only  with worms, three or four days old, and never with simple eggs.    The Lusatian observers, and those of the Palatinate, affirm, that when  common bees are confined with combs absolutely void of eggs, they then  lay none but the eggs of drones. Thus, there must be small queens  producing the eggs of males only, for it is evident they must have  produced those supposed to come from workers. But how is it possible to  conceive that their ovaries contain male eggs alone?    According to M. de Reaumur, the life of chrysalids may be prolonged by  keeping them in a cold situation, such as an ice-house. The same  experiment should be made on the eggs of a queen; on the nymphs of  drones and workers.    Another interesting experiment would be to take away all the combs  composing the common cells, and leave none but those destined for the  larvae of males. By this means we should learn whether the eggs of common  worms, laid by the queen in the large cells, will produce large workers.  It is very probable, however, that deprivation of the common cells might  discourage the bees, because they require them for their honey and wax.  Nevertheless, it is likely, by taking away only part of the common  cells, the workers may be forced to lay common eggs in the cells of  drones.    I should also wish to have the young larvae gently removed from the royal  cell, and deposited at the bottom of a common one, along with some of  the royal food.    As the figure of hives has much influence on the respective disposition  of the combs, it would be a satisfactory experiment, greatly to  diversify their shape and internal dimensions. Nothing could be better  adopted to instruct us how bees can regulate their labours, and apply  them to existing circumstances. This may enable us to discover  particular facts which we cannot foresee.    The royal eggs and those producing drones, have not yet been carefully  compared with the eggs from which workers come. But they ought to be so,  that we may ascertain whether these different eggs have secret  distinctive characteristics.    The food supplied by the workers to the royal worm, is not the same with  that given to the common worm."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26477"],[0,"Observations on the Florid Song; Or, Sentiments on the Ancient and Modern (#4)"],[1," their Voice, or in  order to avoid all Manner of Resemblance of the _odious Ancients_. It  is, however, a manifest Injury they do to the Nightingale, who was the  Origin of it, and the only thing which the Voice can well imitate. But  perhaps they have found some other of the feathered Kind worthy their  Imitation, that sings quite after the New Mode.    Sec. 30. Let the Master never be tired in making the Scholar _Sol-Fa_, as  long as he finds it necessary; for if he should let him sing upon the  Vowels too soon, he knows not how to instruct.    Sec. 31. Next, let him study on the three open Vowels, particularly on the  first, but not always upon the same, as is practised now-a-days; in  order, that from this frequent Exercise he may not confound one with the  other, and that from hence he may the easier come to the use of the  Words.    Sec. 32. The Scholar having now made some remarkable Progress, the  Instructor may acquaint him with the first Embellishments of the Art,  which are the _Appoggiatura's_[15] (to be spoke of next) and apply them  to the Vowels.    Sec. 33. Let him learn the Manner to glide with the Vowels, and to drag the  Voice gently from the high to the lower Notes, which, thro'  Qualifications necessary for singing well, cannot possibly be learn'd  from _Sol-fa_-ing only, and are overlooked by the Unskilful.    Sec. 34. But if he should let him sing the Words, and apply the  _Appoggiatura_ to the Vowels before he is perfect in _Sol-fa_-ing, he  ruins the Scholar.          CHAP. II.[16]    _Of the_ Appoggiatura.[17]      Among all the Embellishments in the Art of Singing, there is none so  easy for the Master to teach, or less difficult for the Scholar to  learn, than the _Appoggiatura_. This, besides its Beauty, has obtained  the sole Privilege of being heard often without tiring, provided it does  not go beyond the Limits prescrib'd by Professors of good Taste.    Sec. 2. From the Time that the _Appoggiatura_ has been invented to adorn  the Art of Singing, the true Reason,[18] why it cannot be used in all  Places, remains yet a Secret. After having searched for it among Singers  of the first Rank in vain, I considered that Musick, as a Science, ought  to have its Rules, and that all Manner of Ways should be tried to  discover them. I do not flatter myself that I am arrived at it; but the  Judicious will see, at least that I am come near it. However, treating  of a Matter wholly produced from my Observations, I should hope for more  Indulgence in this Chapter than in any other.    Sec. 3. From Practice, I perceive, that from _C_ to _C_ by _B Quadro_,[19]  a Voice can ascend and descend gradually with the _Appoggiatura_,  passing without any the least Obstacle thro' all the five _Tones_, and  the two _Semitones_, that make an _Octave_.    Sec. 4. That from every accidental _Diezis_, or Sharp, that may be found in  the Scale, one can gradually rise a _Semitone_ to the nearest Note with  an _Appoggiatura_, and return in the same Manner.[20]    Sec. 5. That from every Note that has a _B Quadro_, or Natural, one can  ascend by _Semitones_ to every one that has a _B Molle_, or Flat, with  an _Appoggiatura_.[21]    Sec. 6. But, contrarywise, my Ear tells me, that from _F_, _G_, _A_, _C_,  and _D_, one cannot rise gradually with an _Appoggiatura_ by  _Semitones_,[22] when any of these five _Tones_ have a Sharp annex'd to  them.    Sec. 7. That one cannot pass with an _Appoggiatura_ gradually from a third  _Minor_ to the Bass, to a third _Major_, nor from the third _Major_ to  the third _Minor_.[23]    Sec. 8. That two consequent _Appoggiatura's_ cannot pass gradually by  _Semitones_ from one _Tone_ to another.[24]    Sec. 9. That one cannot rise by _Semitone_, with an _Appoggiatura_, from  any Note with a Flat.[25]    Sec. 10. And, finally, where the _Appoggiatura_ cannot ascend, it cannot  descend.    Sec. 11. Practice giving us no Insight into the Reason of all these Rules,  let us see if it can be found out by those who ought to account for it.    Sec. 12. Theory teaches us, that the abovementioned _Octave_ consisting of  twelve unequal _Semitones_, it is necessary to distinguish the _Major_  from the _Minor_, and it sends the Student to consult the _Tetrachords_.  The most conspicuous Authors, that treat of them, are not all of the  same Opinion: For we find some who maintain, that from _C_ to _D_, as  well as from _F_ to _G_, the _Semitones_ are equal; and mean while we  are left in Suspense.[26]    Sec. 13. The Ear, however, which is the supreme Umpire in this Art, does in  the _Appoggiatura_ so nicely discern the Quality of the _Semitones_,  that it sufficiently distinguishes the _Semitone Major_. Therefore  going so agreeably from _Mi_ to _Fa_ (that is) from _B Quadro_ to _C_,  or from _E_ to _F_, one ought to conclude That to be a _Semitone Major_,  as it undeniably is. But whence does it proceed, that from this very  _Fa_, (that is from _F_ or _C_) I cannot rise to the next Sharp, which  is also a _Semitone_? It is _Minor_, says the Ear. Therefore I take it  for granted, that the Reason why the _Appoggiatura_ has not a full  Liberty, is, that it cannot pass gradually to a _Semitone Minor_;  submitting myself, however, to better Judgment.[27]    Sec. 14. The _Appoggiatura_ may likewise pass from one distant Note to  another, provided the Skip or Interval be not deceitful; for, in that  Case, whoever does not hit it sure, will show they know not how to  sing.[28]    Sec. 15. Since, as I have said, it is not possible for a Singer to rise  gradually with an _Appoggiatura_ to a _Semitone Minor_, Nature will  teach him to rise a Tone, that from thence he may descend with an  _Appoggiatura to that Semitone_; _or if he has a Mind to_ come to it  without the _Appoggiatura_, to raise the Voice with a _Messa di Voce_,  the Voice always rising till he reaches it.[29]    Sec. 16. If the Scholar be well instructed in this, the _Appoggiatura's_  will become so familiar to him by continual Practice, that by the Time  he is come out of his first Lessons, he will laugh at those Composers  that mark them, with a Design either to be thought Modern, or to shew  that they understand the Art of Singing better than the Singers. If they  have this Superiority over them, why do they not write down even the  Graces, which are more difficult, and more essential than the  _Appoggiatura's_? But if they mark them that they may acquire the  glorious Name of a _Virtuoso alla Moda_, or a Composer in the new Stile,  they ought at least to know, that the Addition of one Note costs little  Trouble, and less Study. Poor _Italy_! pray tell me; do not the Singers  now-a-days know where the _Appoggiatura's_ are to be made, unless they  are pointed at with a Finger? In my Time their own Knowledge shewed it  them. Eternal Shame to him who first introduced these foreign  Puerilities into our Nation, renowned for teaching others the greater  part of the polite Arts; particularly, that of Singing! Oh, how great a  Weakness in those that follow the Example! Oh, injurious Insult to your  Modern Singers, who submit to Instructions fit for Children! Let us  imitate the Foreigners in those Things only, wherein they excel.[30]          CHAP. III.    _Of the Shake._      We meet with two most powerful Obstacles informing the _Shake_. The  first embarrasses the Master; for, to this Hour there is no infallible  Rule found to teach it: And the second affects the Scholar, because  Nature imparts the _Shake_ but to few. The Impatience of the Master  joins with the Despair of the Learner, so that they decline farther  Trouble about it. But in this the Master is blameable, in not doing his  Duty, by leaving the Scholar in Ignorance. One must strive against  Difficulties with Patience to overcome them.    Sec. 2. Whether the _Shake_ be necessary in Singing, ask the Professors of  the first Rank, who know better than any others how often they have been  indebted to it; for, upon any Absence of Mind, they would have betrayed  to the Publick the Sterility of their Art, without the prompt Assistance  of the _Shake_.    Sec. 3. Whoever has a fine _Shake_, tho' wanting in every other Grace,  always enjoys the Advantage of conducting himself without giving  Distaste to the End or Cadence, where for the most part it is very  essential; and who wants it, or has it imperfectly, will never be a  great Singer, let his Knowledge be ever so great.    Sec. 4. The _Shake_ then, being of such Consequence, let the Master, by the  Means of verbal Instructions, and Examples vocal and instrumental,  strive that the Scholar may attain one that is equal, distinctly mark'd,  easy, and moderately quick, which are its most beautiful  Qualifications.    Sec. 5. In case the Master should not know how many sorts of _Shakes_ there  are, I shall acquaint him, that the Ingenuity of the Professors hath  found so many Ways, distinguishing them with different Names, that one  may say there are eight Species of them.[31]    Sec. 6. The first is the _Shake Major_, from the violent Motion of two  neighbouring Sounds at the Distance of a _Tone_, one of which may be  called Principal, because it keeps with greater Force the Place of the  Note which requires it; the other, notwithstanding it possesses in its  Motion the superior Sound appears no other than an Auxiliary. From this  _Shake_ all the others are derived.[32]    Sec. 7. The second is the _Shake Minor_, consisting of a Sound, and its  neighbouring _Semitone Major_; and where the one or the other of these,  two _Shakes_ are proper, the Compositions will easily shew. From the  inferior or lower Cadences, the first, or full _Tone Shake_ is for ever  excluded.[33] If the Difference of these two _Shakes_ is not easily  discovered in the Singer, whenever it is with a _Semitone_, one may  attribute the Cause to the want of Force of the Auxiliary to make itself  heard distinctly; besides, this _Shake_ being more difficult to be beat "]]]
