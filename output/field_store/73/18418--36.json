This is a world in which dwell, for a  time, all babies, whether they have two legs, like you and Larie, or  four, like a pig with a curly tail, or six, like Nata who lived in  Shanty Creek.[1] An important world it is, too; for health and strength  and growing up, all depend upon it.    There was, however, only a rim of soft fine dry grass to show where  Larie's nest-world left off and his third world began. So it is not  surprising that, as soon as their legs were strong enough, Larie and his  brother and sister stepped abroad; for what baby does not creep out of  his crib as soon as ever he can?    They could not, for all this show of bravery, feed themselves like the  sons of Peter Pan, or swim the waters like Gavia's two Olairs at Immer  Lake. However grown up the three youngsters may have felt when they  began to walk, Father and Mother Gull made no mistake about the matter,  but fed them breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, and stuffed them so full  of luncheons between meals, that the greedy little things just had to  grow, so as to be able to swallow all that was brought them.    There were times, certainly, when Larie still felt very much a baby,  even though he ran about nimbly enough. For instance, when he made a  mistake and asked some gull, that was not his father or mother, for  food, and got a rough beating instead of what he begged for!    Oh, then he felt like a forlorn little baby, indeed; for it was not  pleasant to be whipped, and that sometimes cruelly, when he didn't know  any better; for all the big gulls looked alike, with their foam-white  bodies and their pearl-gray capes, and they were all bringing food; so  how could he know who were and who were not his Father and Mother Gull?  Well, he must learn to be careful, that was all, and stay where his very  own could find and feed him; for gulls can waste no time on the young of  other gulls--their own keep them busy enough, the little greedies!    Again, Larie must have felt very wee and helpless whenever a big man  walked that way, shaking the ground with his heavy step and making a  dark shadow as he came. Then, oh, then, Larie was a baby, and hid near a  tuft of grass or between two stones, tucking his head out of sight, and  keeping quite still as an ostrich does, or,--yes,--as perhaps a shy  young human does, who hides his head in the folds of his mother's skirt  when a stranger asks him to shake hands.    But few men trod upon Larie's island-world, and no man came to do him  harm; for _the regulations under the Migratory-Bird Treaty Act prohibit  throughout the United States the killing of gulls at any time_. That  means that the laws of our country protect the gull, as of course you  will understand, though Larie knew nothing about the matter.    Yes, think of it! There was a law, made at Washington in the District of  Columbia, which helped take care of little downy Larie way off in the  north on a rocky island.    I said \"helped take care of\"; for no law, however good it may be, can  more than help make matters right. There has to be, besides, some sort  of policeman to stand by the law and see that it is obeyed.    So Larie, although he never knew that, either, had a policeman; and the  law and the policeman together kept him quite safe from the dangers  which not many years ago most threatened the gulls on our coast islands.  In those days, before there were gull-laws and gull-policemen, people  came to the nests and took their eggs, which are larger than hens' eggs  and good to eat; and people came, too, and killed these birds for their  feathers. Then it was that the beautiful stiff wing-feathers, which  should have been spread in flight, were worn upon the hats of women; and  the soft white breast-feathers, which should have been brooding brownish  eggs all spattered over with pretty marks, were stuffed into  feather-beds for people to sleep on.    Well it was for Larie that he lived when he did; for his third world was  a wonderful place and it was right that he should enjoy it in safety.  When Larie first left his nest and went out to walk, he stepped upon a  shelf of reddish rock, and the whole wall from which his shelf stuck out  was reddish rock, too. Beyond, the rocks were greenish, and beyond that  they were gray. Oh! the reddish and greenish and grayish rocks were  beautiful to see when the fog lifted and the sun shone on them.    But Larie's island-world was not all rock of different colors: for over  there, not too far away to see, was a dark-green spruce tree. Because  rough winds had swept over this while it was growing, its branches were  scraggly and twisted. They could not grow straight and even, like a tree  in a quiet forest. But never think, for all of that, that Larie's spruce  was not good to look upon. There is something splendid about a tree  which, though bending to the will of the mighty winds that work their  force upon it, grows sturdy and strong in spite of all. Such trees are  somehow like boys and girls, who meet hardships with such courage when  they are young, that they grow strong and sturdy of spirit, and warm of  heart, with the sort of mind that can understand trouble in the world,  and so think of ways to help it.    [Illustration: _Birds, too, that had lived in rough winds._]    Yes, perhaps Larie's tree was an emblem of courage. However that may be,  it was a favorite spot on the island. Often it could be seen, that dark,  rugged tree, which had battled with winds from its seedling days and  grown victoriously, with three white gulls resting on its squarish  top--birds, too, that had lived in rough winds and had grown strong in  their midst.    There was more on the island than rocks and trees. Over much of it lay a  carpet of grass. Soft and fine and vivid green it was, of the kind that  had been gathered for Larie's nest and had turned yellowish in drying.  Under the carpet, in underground lanes as long as a man's long arm,  lived Larie's young neighbor-folk--little petrels, sometimes called  \"Mother Carey's Chickens.\"    There was even more on the island yet: for high on the rocks stood a  lighthouse; and the man who kept the signal lights in order was no other  than Larie's policeman himself. A useful life he lived, saving ships of  the sea by the power of light, and birds of the sea by the power of law.    So that was Larie's third world--an island with a soft rug of  bright-green grass, and big shelfy rocks of red and green and gray, and  rugged dark-green trees, with white gulls resting on the branches, and a  lighthouse with its signal.    All around and about that island lay Larie's fourth world--the sea.  When his great day for swimming came, he slipped off into the water; and  after that it was his, whenever he wished--his to swim or float upon,  the wide-away ocean reaching as far as any gull need care to swim or  float.    All over and above the sea stretched Larie's fifth world--the air. When  his great day for flying came, he rose against the breeze, and his wings  took him into that high-away kingdom that lifted as far as any gull need  care to fly.    Now that Larie could both swim and fly, he was large, and acted in many  ways like an old gull; but the feathers of his body were not white, and  he did not wear over his back and the top of his spread wings a  pearl-gray mantle.    Nor was he given the garb of his father and mother for a traveling suit,  that winter when he went south with the others, to a place where the  Gulf Stream warmed the water whereon he swam and the air wherein he  flew.    But there came a time when Larie had put off the clothes of his youth  and donned the robe of a grown gull. And as he sailed in the breezes of  his fifth world, which blew over the cold sea, and across the island  with a carpet of green and rocks of red and green and gray,--for he was  again in the North,--he was beautiful to behold, the flight of a gull  being so wonderful that the heart of him who sees quickens with joy.    Larie was not alone. There were so many with him that, when they flew  together in the distance, they looked as thick as snowflakes in the air;  and when they screamed together, the din was so great that people who  were not used to hearing them put their hands over their ears.    And more than that, Larie was not alone; for there sailed near him in  the air and floated beside him in the sea another gull, at whom he did  not scream, but to whom he talked pleasantly, saying, \"me-you,\" in a  musical tone that she understood.    [Illustration: _Floated beside him in the sea another gull, to whom he  talked pleasantly._]    Larie and his mate found much to do that spring. One game that never  failed to interest them was meeting the ships many, many waves out at  sea, and following them far on their way. For on the ships were men who  threw away food they could not use, and the gulls gathered in flocks to  scramble and fight for this. Children on board the ships laughed merrily  to see them, and tossed crackers and biscuits out for the fun of  watching the hungry-birds come close, to feed.    Many a feast, too, the fishermen gave the gulls, when they sorted the  contents of their nets and threw aside what they did not want.    Besides this, Larie and his mate and their comrades picnicked in high  glee at certain harbors where garbage was left; for gulls are thrifty  folk and do not waste the food of the world.    From their feeding habits you will know that these beautiful birds are  scavengers, eating things which, if left on the sea or shore, would make  the water foul and the air impure. Thus it is that Nature gives to a  scavenger the duty of service to all living creatures; and the freshness  of the ocean and the cleanness of the sands of the shore are in part a  gift of the gulls, for which we should thank and protect them.    Relish as they might musty bread and mouldy meat, Larie and his mate  enjoyed, too, the sport of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25609"],[0,"A Child's Garden of Verses (#4)"],[1,"      Spreads in a twinkle          And blots all out.        See the rings pursue each other;        All below grows black as night,          Just as if mother          Had blown out the light!        Patience, children, just a minute--        See the spreading circles die;          The stream and all in it          Will clear by-and-by.          FAIRY BREAD          Come up here, O dusty feet!        Here is fairy bread to eat.      Here in my retiring room,        Children, you may dine      On the golden smell of broom        And the shade of pine;      And when you have eaten well,      Fairy stories hear and tell.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE          Faster than fairies, faster than witches,      Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;      And charging along like troops in a battle      All through the meadows the horses and cattle:      All of the sights of the hill and the plain      Fly as thick as driving rain;      And ever again, in the wink of an eye,      Painted stations whistle by.      Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,      All by himself and gathering brambles;      Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;      And there is the green for stringing the daisies      Here is a cart run away in the road      Lumping along with man and load;      And here is a mill, and there is a river:      Each a glimpse and gone for ever!          WINTER-TIME          Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,      A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;      Blinks but an hour or two; and then,      A blood-red orange, sets again.        Before the stars have left the skies,      At morning in the dark I rise;      And shivering in my nakedness,      By the cold candle, bathe and dress.        Close by the jolly fire I sit      To warm my frozen bones a bit;      Or with a reindeer-sled, explore      The colder countries round the door.        When to go out, my nurse doth wrap      Me in my comforter and cap;      The cold wind burns my face, and blows      Its frosty pepper up my nose.        Black are my steps on silver sod;      Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;      And tree and house, and hill and lake,      Are frosted like a wedding-cake.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE HAYLOFT          Through all the pleasant meadow-side        The grass grew shoulder-high,      Till the shining scythes went far and wide        And cut it down to dry.        Those green and sweetly smelling crops        They led in waggons home;      And they piled them here in mountain tops        For mountaineers to roam.        Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail,        Mount Eagle and Mount High;--      The mice that in these mountains dwell,        No happier are than I!        Oh, what a joy to clamber there,        Oh, what a place for play,      With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,        The happy hills of hay!    [Illustration: THE HAYLOFT]    [Illustration]          FAREWELL TO THE FARM          The coach is at the door at last;      The eager children, mounting fast      And kissing hands, in chorus sing:      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!        To house and garden, field and lawn,      The meadow-gates we swang upon,      To pump and stable, tree and swing,      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!        And fare you well for evermore,      O ladder at the hayloft door,      O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!        Crack goes the whip, and off we go;      The trees and houses smaller grow;      Last, round the woody turn we swing:      Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!    [Illustration]          NORTH-WEST PASSAGE      _1. Good-night_        When the bright lamp is carried in,      The sunless hours again begin;      O'er all without, in field and lane,      The haunted night returns again.        Now we behold the embers flee      About the firelit hearth; and see      Our faces painted as we pass,      Like pictures, on the window-glass.        Must we to bed indeed? Well then,      Let us arise and go like men,      And face with an undaunted tread      The long black passage up to bed.    [Illustration: NORTH-WEST PASSAGE]        Farewell, O brother, sister, sire!      O pleasant party round the fire!      The songs you sing, the tales you tell,      Till far to-morrow, fare ye well!    [Illustration]      _2. Shadow March_        All round the house is the jet-black night;      It stares through the window-pane;      It crawls in the corners, hiding from the light,      And it moves with the moving flame.        Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum,      With the breath of the Bogie in my hair;      And all round the candle the crooked shadows come,      And go marching along up the stair.        The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp,        The shadow of the child that goes to bed--      All the wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp,        With the black night overhead.    [Illustration]      _3. In Port_        Last, to the chamber where I lie      My fearful footsteps patter nigh,      And come from out the cold and gloom      Into my warm and cheerful room.        There, safe arrived, we turn about      To keep the coming shadows out,      And close the happy door at last      On all the perils that we past.        Then, when mamma goes by to bed,      She shall come in with tip-toe tread,      And see me lying warm and fast      And in the Land of Nod at last.          THE CHILD ALONE    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE          When children are playing alone on the green,      In comes the playmate that never was seen.      When children are happy and lonely and good,      The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.        Nobody heard him and nobody saw,      His is a picture you never could draw,      But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home,      When children are happy and playing alone.        He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass,      He sings when you tinkle the musical glass;      Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why,      The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!        He loves to be little, he hates to be big,      'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig;      'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin      That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.        'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed,      Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head;      For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf,      'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself!    [Illustration]          MY SHIP AND I          O it's I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,        Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;      And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;      But when I'm a little older, I shall find the secret out        How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.        For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,        And the dolly I intend to come alive;      And with him beside to help me, it's a-sailing I shall go,      It's a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow        And the vessel goes a divie-divie-dive.        O it's then you'll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,        And you'll hear the water singing at the prow;      For beside the dolly sailor, I'm to voyage and explore,      To land upon the island where no dolly was before,        And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.    [Illustration]          MY KINGDOM          Down by a shining water well      I found a very little dell,        No higher than my head.      The heather and the gorse about      In summer bloom were coming out,        Some yellow and some red.        I called the little pool a sea;      The little hills were big to me;        For I am very small.      I made a boat, I made a town,      I searched the caverns up and down,        And named them one and all.        And all about was mine, I said,      The little sparrows overhead,        The little minnows too.      This was the world and I was king;      For me the bees came by to sing,        For me the swallows flew.        I played there were no deeper seas,      Nor any wider plains than these,        Nor other kings than me.      At last I heard my mother call      Out from the house at evenfall,        To call me home to tea.        And I must rise and leave my dell,      And leave my dimpled water well,        And leave my heather blooms.      Alas! and as my home I neared,      How very big my nurse appeared.        How great and cool the rooms!

How am I to sing your praise,      Happy chimney-corner days,      Sitting safe in nursery nooks,      Reading picture story-books?
