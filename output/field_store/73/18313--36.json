A dirty handkerchief rolled over the head, and a wisp of  something, which might have been linen, bound round the loins, formed  their attire. Perhaps, however, the thick coating of dirt which  covered them kept them warmer than more civilized clothing, besides  being indisputably more economical.    The boat was generally propelled by paddles, but when the river was  shallow, poles were used to punt us along, as on English rivers; the  black padrone, whose superior position was indicated by the use of  decent clothing, standing at the helm, gesticulating wildly, and  swearing Spanish oaths with a vehemence that would have put Corporal  Trim's comrades in Flanders to the blush. Very much shocked, of  course, but finding it perfectly useless to remonstrate with him, I  swung myself in my hammock and leisurely watched the river scene.    The river Chagres lolled with considerable force, now between low  marshy shores, now narrowing, between steep, thickly wooded banks. It  was liable, as are all rivers in hilly districts, to sudden and heavy  floods; and although the padrone, on leaving Gatun, had pledged his  soul to land me at Cruces that night, I had not been long afloat  before I saw that he would forfeit his worthless pledge; for the wind  rose to a gale, ruffling the river here and there into a little sea;  the rain came down in torrents, while the river rose rapidly, bearing  down on its swollen stream trunks of trees, and similar waifs and  strays, which it tossed about like a giant in sport, threatening to  snag us with its playthings every moment. And when we came to a  sheltered reach, and found that the little fleet of boats which had  preceded us had laid to there, I came to the conclusion that, stiff,  tired, and hungry, I should have to pass a night upon the river  Chagres. All I could get to eat was some guavas, which grew wild upon  the banks, and then I watched the padrone curl his long body up among  my luggage, and listened to the crew, who had rolled together at the  bottom of the boat, snore as peacefully as if they slept between fair  linen sheets, in the purest of calico night-gear, and the most  unexceptionable of nightcaps, until somehow I fell into a troubled,  dreamy sleep.    At daybreak we were enabled to pursue our journey, and in a short time  reached Gorgona. I was glad enough to go on shore, as you may imagine.  Gorgona was a mere temporary town of bamboo and wood houses, hastily  erected to serve as a station for the crowd. In the present rainy  season, when the river was navigable up to Cruces, the chief part of  the population migrated thither, so that Gorgona was almost deserted,  and looked indescribably damp, dirty, and dull. With some difficulty I  found a bakery and a butcher's shop. The meat was not very tempting,  for the Gorgona butchers did not trouble themselves about joints, but  cut the flesh into strips about three inches wide, and of various  lengths. These were hung upon rails, so that you bought your meat by  the yard, and were spared any difficulty in the choice of joint. I  cannot say that I was favourably impressed with this novel and simple  way of avoiding trouble, but I was far too hungry to be particular,  and buying a strip for a quarter of a real, carried it off to Mac to  cook.    Late that afternoon, the padrone and his crew landed me, tired,  wretched, and out of temper, upon the miserable wharf of Cruces.          CHAPTER III.        MY RECEPTION AT THE INDEPENDENT HOTEL--A CRUCES TABLE      D'HOTE--LIFE IN CRUCES--AMUSEMENTS OF THE CROWDS--A      NOVEL FOUR-POST BED.      The sympathising reader, who very likely has been laughing heartily at  my late troubles, can fancy that I was looking forward with no little  pleasurable anticipation to reaching my brother's cheerful home at  Cruces. After the long night spent on board the wretched boat in my  stiff, clayey dress, and the hours of fasting, the warmth and good  cheer of the Independent Hotel could not fail to be acceptable. My  brother met me on the rickety wharf with the kindest welcome in his  face, although he did not attempt to conceal a smile at my forlorn  appearance, and giving the necessary instructions about my luggage,  led the way at once to his house, which was situated at the upper end  of the street. A capital site, he said, when the rest of the town was  under water--which agreeable variety occurred twice or thrice a year  unexpectedly. On our way, he rather damped my hopes by expressing his  fears that he should be unable to provide his sister with the  accommodation he could wish. For you see, he said, the crowd from  Panama has just come in, meeting your crowd from Navy Bay; and I  shouldn't be at all surprised if very many of them have no better bed  than the store floors. But, despite this warning, I was miserably  unprepared for the reception that awaited me. To be sure, I found  Cruces as like Gorgona, in its dampness, dirt, and confusion, as it  well could be; but the crowd from the gold-fields of California had  just arrived, having made the journey from Panama on mules, and the  street was filled with motley groups in picturesque variety of attire.  The hotels were also full of them, while many lounged in the verandahs  after their day's journey. Rude, coarse gold-diggers, in gay-coloured  shirts, and long, serviceable boots, elbowed, in perfect equality,  keen Yankee speculators, as close shaven, neat, and clean on the  Isthmus of Panama as in the streets of New York or New Orleans. The  women alone kept aloof from each other, and well they might; for,  while a very few seemed not ashamed of their sex, it was somewhat  difficult to distinguish the majority from their male companions, save  by their bolder and more reckless voice and manner. I must say,  however, that many of them adopted male attire for the journey across  the Isthmus only, as it spared them many compliments which their  husbands were often disposed to resent, however flattering they might  be to their choice.    Through all these I pressed on, stiff, cold, and hungry, to the  Independent Hotel, eagerly anticipating the comforts which awaited me  there. At length we reached it. But, rest! warmth! comfort!--miserable  delusions! Picture to yourself, sympathising reader, a long, low hut,  built of rough, unhewn, unplaned logs, filled up with mud and split  bamboo; a long, sloping roof and a large verandah, already full of  visitors. And the interior: a long room, gaily hung with dirty  calico, in stripes of red and white; above it another room, in which  the guests slept, having the benefit of sharing in any orgies which  might be going on below them, through the broad chinks between the  rough, irregular planks which formed its floor. At the further end, a  small corner, partitioned roughly off, formed a bar, and around it  were shelves laden with stores for the travellers, while behind it was  a little room used by my brother as his private apartment; but three  female travellers had hired it for their own especial use for the  night, paying the enormous sum of L10 for so exclusive a luxury. At  the entrance sat a black man, taking toll of the comers-in, giving  them in exchange for coin or gold-dust (he had a rusty pair of scales  to weigh the latter) a dirty ticket, which guaranteed them supper, a  night's lodging, and breakfast. I saw all this very quickly, and  turned round upon my brother in angry despair.    \"What am I to do? Why did you ever bring me to this place? See what a  state I am in--cold, hungry, and wretched. I want to wash, to change  my clothes, to eat, to----\"    But poor Edward could only shrug his shoulders and shake his head, in  answer to my indignant remonstrances. At last he made room for me in a  corner of the crowded bar, set before me some food, and left me to  watch the strange life I had come to; and before long I soon forgot my  troubles in the novelty of my position.    The difference between the passengers to and from California was very  distinguishable. Those bound for the gold country were to a certain  extent fresh from civilization, and had scarcely thrown off its  control; whereas the homeward bound revelled in disgusting excess of  licence. Although many of the women on their way to California showed  clearly enough that the life of licence they sought would not be  altogether unfamiliar to them, they still retained some appearance of  decency in their attire and manner; but in many cases (as I have  before said) the female companions of the successful gold-diggers  appeared in no hurry to resume the dress or obligations of their sex.  Many were clothed as the men were, in flannel shirt and boots; rode  their mules in unfeminine fashion, but with much ease and courage; and  in their conversation successfully rivalled the coarseness of their  lords. I think, on the whole, that those French lady writers who  desire to enjoy the privileges of man, with the irresponsibility of  the other sex, would have been delighted with the disciples who were  carrying their principles into practice in the streets of Cruces.    The chief object of all the travellers seemed to be dinner or supper;  I do not know what term they gave it. Down the entire length of the  Independent Hotel ran a table covered with a green oilskin cloth, and  at proper intervals were placed knives and forks, plates, and cups and  saucers turned down; and when a new-comer received his ticket, and  wished to secure his place for the coming repast, he would turn his  plate, cup, and saucer up; which mode of reserving seats seemed  respected by the rest. And as the evening wore on, the shouting and  quarrelling at the doorway in Yankee twang increased momentarily;  while some seated themselves at the table, and hammering upon it with  the handles of their knives, hallooed out to the excited nigger cooks  to make haste "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#4)"],[1,"reflected back and  forth from the nation upon its literature, as well as from its  literature upon the nation. But where else in the world has it ever been  so extraordinarily, we may say so appallingly, true as in France, that  the nation was such because such was its literature?    French literature, it will at once be seen, is a study possessing,  beyond the literary, a social, a political, and even a religious,  interest.    Readers desiring to push their conversance with the literary history of  France farther than the present volume will enable them to do, will  consult with profit either the Primer, or the Short History, of French  Literature, by Mr. George Saintsbury. Mr. Saintsbury is a well-informed  writer, who, if the truth must be told, diffuses himself too widely to  do his best possible work. He has, however, made French literature a  specialty, and he is in general a trustworthy authority on the subject.    Another writer on the subject is Mr. H. Van Laun. Him, although a  predecessor of his own in the field, Mr. Saintsbury severely ignores, by  claiming that he is himself the first to write in English a history of  French literature based on original and independent reading of the  authors. We are bound to say that Mr. Van Laun's work is of very poor  quality. It offers, indeed, to the reader one advantage not afforded by  either of Mr. Saintsbury's works, the advantage, namely, of illustrative  extracts from the authors treated,--extracts, however, not unfrequently  marred by wretched translation. The cyclopaedias are, some of them, both  in articles on particular authors and in their sketches of French  literary history as a whole, good sources of general information on the  subject. Readers who command the means of comparing several different  cyclopaedias, or several successive editions of some one cyclopaedia, as,  for example, the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica,\" will find enlightening and  stimulating the not always harmonious views presented on the same  topics. Hallam's \"History of Literature in Europe\" is an additional  authority by no means to be overlooked.          II.    FROISSART.    1337-1410.      French literature, for the purposes of the present volume, may be said  to commence with Froissart. Froissart is a kind of mediaeval Herodotus.  His time is, indeed, almost this side the middle ages; but he belongs by  character and by sympathy rather to the mediaeval than to the modern  world. He is delightfully like Herodotus in the style and the spirit of  his narrative. Like Herodotus, he became a traveller in order to become  an historian. Like Herodotus, he was cosmopolite enough not to be  narrowly patriotic. Frenchman though he was, he took as much pleasure in  recounting English victories as he did in recounting French. His  countrymen have even accused him of unpatriotic partiality for the  English. His Chronicles have been, perhaps, more popular in their  English form than in their original French. Two prominent English  translations have been made, of which the later, that by Thomas Johnes,  is now most read. Sir Walter Scott thought the earlier excelled in charm  of style.    Jehan or Jean Froissart was a native of Valenciennes. His father meant  to make a priest of him, but the boy had other tastes of his own. Before  he was well out of his teens, he began writing history. This was under  the patronage of a great noble. Froissart was all his life a natural  courtier. He throve on the patronage of the great. It was probably not a  fawning spirit in him that made him this kind of man; it was rather an  innate love of splendor and high exploit. He admired chivalry, then in  its last days, and he painted it with the passion of an idealizer. His  father had been an heraldic painter, so it was perhaps an hereditary  strain in the son that naturally attached him to rank and royalty. The  people--that is, the promiscuous mass of mankind--hardly exist to  Froissart. His pages, spacious as they are, have scarcely room for more  than kings and nobles, and knights and squires. He is a picturesque and  romantic historian, in whose chronicles the glories of the world of  chivalry--a world, as we have said, already dying, and so soon to  disappear--are fixed forever on an ample canvas, in moving form and  shifting color, to delight the backward-looking imagination of mankind.    Froissart, besides being chronicler, was something of a poet. It would  still be possible to confront one who should call this in question, with  thirty thousand surviving verses from the chronicler's pen. Quantity,  indeed, rather than quality, is the strong point of Froissart as poet.    He had no sooner finished the first part of his Chronicles, a  compilation from the work of an earlier hand, than he posted to England  for the purpose of formally presenting his work to the Queen, a princess  of Hainault. She rewarded him handsomely. Woman enough, too, she was,  woman under the queen, duly to despatch him back again to his native  land, where the young fellow's heart, she saw, was lost to a noble lady,  whom, from his inferior station, he could woo only as a moth might woo  the moon. He subsequently returned to Great Britain, and rode about on  horseback gathering materials of history. He visited Italy under  excellent auspices, and, together with Chaucer and with Petrarch,  witnessed a magnificent marriage ceremonial in Milan. Froissart  continued to travel far and wide, always a favorite with princes, but  always intent on achieving his projected work. He finally died at  Chimay, where he had spent his closing years in rounding out to their  completeness his \"Chronicles of England, France, and the Adjoining  Countries.\"    Froissart is the most leisurely of historians, or, rather, he is a  writer who presupposes the largest allowance of leisure at the command  of his readers. He does not seek proportion and perspective. He simply  tells us all he had been able to find out respecting each transaction in  its turn as it successively comes up in the progress of his narrative.  If he goes wrong to-day, he will perhaps correct himself to-morrow, or  day after to-morrow,--this not by changing the first record where it  stands, to make it right, but by inserting a note of his mistake at the  point, whatever it may be, which he shall chance to have reached in the  work of composition when the new and better light breaks in on his eyes.  The student is thus never quite certain but that what he is at one  moment reading in his author, may be an error of which at some  subsequent moment he will be faithfully advised. A little discomposing,  this, but such is Froissart; and it is the philosophical way to take  your author as he is, and make the best of him.    Of such an historian, an historian so diffuse, and so little selective,  it would obviously be difficult to give any suitably brief specimen that  should seem to present a considerable historic action in full. We go to  Froissart's account of the celebrated battle of Poitiers (France). This  was fought in 1356, between Edward the Black Prince on the English side,  and King John on the side of the French.    King John of the French was, of course, a great prize to be secured by  the victorious English. There was eager individual rivalry as to what  particular warrior should be adjudged his true captor. Froissart thus  describes the strife and the issue:--         There was much pressing at this time, through eagerness to take the       king; and those who were nearest to him, and knew him, cried out,       \"Surrender yourself, surrender yourself, or you are a dead man!\" In       that part of the field was a young knight from St. Omer, who was       engaged by a salary in the service of the King of England; his name       was Denys de Morbeque; who for five years had attached himself to       the English, on account of having been banished in his younger days       from France, for a murder committed in an affray at St. Omer. It       fortunately happened for this knight, that he was at the time near       to the King of France, when he was so much pulled about. He, by       dint of force, for he was very strong and robust, pushed through       the crowd, and said to the king, in good French, \"Sire, sire,       surrender yourself!\" The king, who found himself very disagreeably       situated, turning to him, asked, \"To whom shall I surrender myself?       to whom? Where is my cousin, the Prince of Wales? If I could see       him, I would speak to him.\"--\"Sire,\" replied Sir Denys, \"he is not       here; but surrender yourself to me, and I will lead you to       him.\"--\"Who are you?\" said the king. \"Sire, I am Denys de Morbeque,       a knight from Artois; but I serve the King of England because I       cannot belong to France, having forfeited all I possessed there.\"       The king then gave him his right-hand glove, and said, \"I surrender       myself to you.\" There was much crowding and pushing about; for       every one was eager to cry out, \"I have taken him!\" Neither the       king nor his youngest son Philip were able to get forward, and free       themselves from the throng....         The Prince [of Wales] asked them [his marshals] if they knew any       thing of the King of France: they replied, \"No, sir, not for a       certainty; but we believe he must be either killed or made       prisoner, since he has never quitted his battalion.\" The prince       then, addressing the Earl of Warwick and Lord Cobham, said, \"I beg       of you to mount your horses, and ride over the field, so that on       your return you may bring me some certain intelligence of him.\" The       two barons, immediately mounting their horses, left the prince, and       made for a small hillock, that they might look about them. From       their stand they perceived a crowd of men-at-arms on foot, who were       advancing very slowly. The King of France was in the midst of them, "]]]
