And they are correct. They  cannot, not with the thick voice. Even when putting forth considerable  exertion, they will pass to the thin voice at        [Music: g' {or} a']    and lower, if they sing softly. This phenomenon, then, is the \"movable  break\" of the child-voice. The pitch at which the child-voice passes  from the thick to the thin voice depends first upon the age; second,  upon the amount of physical energy employed, and third, upon the bodily  vigor of the child.    It may also be added that boys' voices break lower than girls' during  the year or two preceding change of voice. When, now, it is remembered  that the adult female voice leaves the chest-register at        [Music: f' f#']    it will be admitted by everyone who has had actual experience in class  singing in schools or elsewhere, that the facts set forth in reference  to the ability of the child to carry the thick voice from one to eight  tones higher than the adult, has a very important bearing on the subject  of training children's voices.    But, is it physically injurious? It may be said that, as regards upward  forcing of the vocal register, authorities upon the adult voice are  united. Leo Kofler, in \"The Art of Breathing,\" p. 168, says: \"I have met  female trebles that used this means of forcing up the chest-tones as  high as middle A, B, C, and (one can hardly conceive of the physical  possibility of so doing) even as far as D and E flat. The reason why  this practice is so dangerous lies in the unnatural way in which the  larynx is held down in the throat, and in the force that is exercised by  the tension muscles of the vocal ligaments and the hard pressure of the  muscles of the tongue-bone.... I have examined with the laryngoscope  many ladies who had the habit of singing the chest-tones too high, and,  without exception, I have found their throats in a more or less diseased  condition. Laryngitis, either alone or complicated with pharyngitis,  relaxation of the vocal ligaments, and sometimes paralysis of one of  them, are the most frequent results of this bad habit. If a singer is  afflicted with catarrhal trouble, it is always aggravated by this  abominable method of singing.\"    Emma Seiler, in \"The Voice in Singing,\" p. 54, after describing the  action of the vocal ligaments in the production of the chest-voice and  alluding to the fact that such action can be continued several tones  higher than the proper transitional point, goes on: \"But such tones,  especially in the female voice, have that rough and common timbre, which  we are too often compelled to hear in our female singers. The glottis  also in this case, as well as parts of the larynx near the glottis,  betrays the effort very plainly; as the tones ascend, they grow more and  more red. _Thus, as at this place in the chest-register, there occurs a  visible and sensible straining of the organs, so also is it in all the  remaining transitions, as soon as the attempt is made to extend the  action by which the lower tones are formed beyond the given limits of  the same_.\" And again: \"In the ignorance existing concerning the natural  transitions of the registers, and in the unnatural forcing of the voice,  is found a chief cause of the decline in the art of singing, and the  present inability to preserve the voice is the consequence of a method  of teaching unnatural, and, therefore, imposing too great a strain upon  the voice.\" Quotations innumerable might be made, to give more emphasis,  were it needed, to the evils of register forcing.    The only point remaining is the one very often raised. Is it not  _natural for children_ to use the chest or thick voice? If their vocal  organs are so flexible, may they not carry such tones higher than  adults, and younger children higher than those a little older, and  so on?    It is quite obvious, for reasons herein set forth, that children do not  experience the same degree of difficulty in continuing the use of the  thick voice to their higher tones as do adults, but as to the effect  upon their vocal organs there need be no reasonable doubt. A. B. Bach,  in \"Principles of Singing,\" p. 142, says: \"If children are allowed to  sing their higher notes forte, before the voice is properly equalized,  it will become hard, harsh and hoarse, and they will fail in correct  intonation. A mistake in this direction not only ruins the middle  register but destroys the voice altogether. The consequence of  encouraging forte singing is to change a soprano rapidly to an alto; and  they will generally sing alto equally forte because their vocal cords  have lost their elasticity through overstraining and the notes will no  longer answer to piano. . . . . The fact is that reckless singing often  breaks tender voices and breaks them forever.\" It may be observed that  the writer cited evidently accepts the same classification in register  for children and adult women's voices, but this does not make the above  extract any less applicable. The baneful effects of forcing the voice is  clearly set forth. How to avoid it is another matter.    Leo Kofler, in the work previously mentioned, p. 168, refers to this  point as follows: \"It frequently happens that the tones of the lower  range, or the so-called chest-tones, are forced up too high into the  middle range. This bad habit is often contracted while the singers are  quite young. Boy trebles have this habit to an unendurable degree,  usually screaming those horrible chest-tones up to middle C. Of all bad  habits, this one is the most liable to injure a voice and to detract  from artistic singing.\"    To cite Madame Seiler once more, p. 176: \"While it often happens that at  the most critical age while the vocal organs are being developed,  children sing with all the strength they can command. Boys, however, in  whom the larynx at a certain period undergoes an entire transformation,  reach only with difficulty the higher soprano or contralto tones, but  are not assigned a lower part until perceiving themselves the  impossibility of singing in this way, they beg the teacher for the  change, often too late, unhappily, to prevent an irreparable injury.  Moderate singing without exertion, and above all things, within the  natural limits of the voice and its registers, would even during the  period of growth be as little hurtful as speaking, laughing or any other  exercise which cannot be forbidden to the vocal organs.\"    Browne and Behnke, who separately and together have given most valuable  additions to the literature of the voice, in a small book entitled \"The  Child-Voice,\" have collated a large number of answers from distinguished  singers, teachers and choir-trainers to various questions relating to  the subject. The following citation is from this interesting work,  p. 39: \"The necessity of limiting the compass of children's voices is  frequently insisted upon, no attention whatever being paid to  _registers_; and yet in finitely more mischief is done by forcing the  registers than would be accomplished by allowing children to exceed the  compass generally assigned to them, always provided that the singing be  the result of using the mechanism set apart by nature for different  parts of the voice.\"    There can really be no doubt that the use of the chest or thick voice  upon the higher tones is injurious to a child of six years, or ten  years, or of any other age. The theory that in the child-voice the  breaks occur at higher fixed pitches than in the adult is shown to be  untenable. The fact would seem to be that comparisons between the  registers of the child and the adult voice are misleading, since the  adult voice has fixed points of change in the vocal mechanism, which can  be transcended only with great difficulty, while the child-voice has _no  fixed points of change in its vocal registers_. This point must not be  overlooked. It is the most important fact connected with the child-voice  in speech or song. It is the fundamental idea of this work and is the  basis for whatever suggestions are herein contained upon the management  of the child-voice. The rigidity of the adult larynx, the strength of  the tensor and adductor muscles and the elastic firmness of the vocal  ligaments, are to those of the child as the solid bony framework and  strongly set muscles of maturity are to the imperfectly hardened bones  and soft muscles of childhood. Nature makes no fixed limits of the vocal  registers until full maturity is reached. A fixed register in a childish  throat involving a completely developed larynx would be a startling  anomaly. The laryngeal muscles of childhood are not strong. They are  weak. Most of the talk about strength of voice in children is utter  nonsense. When the muscles and other parts concerned in tone-production  perform their physiological functions in a healthy manner, that is, in  such a way that no congestion, or inflammation or undue weariness will  result, the singing-tone of the child will never be loud. High or low,  under these conditions it must perforce be soft, and if proper  directions be followed the quality will be as good as the voice is  capable of.    Everyone who has observed has also noticed the contrast in the lower  tones of children and women. The chest-voice of the woman, which she  uses in singing her lower register, is normally very beautiful in its  quality. Its tones are the product of a perfectly developed, full-grown  organ. The chest-voice of the child is an abnormal product of a weak,  growing, undeveloped organ. It possesses, even when used carefully,  little of the tone tints of the adult voice. The chest-voice belongs to  adult life, not to childhood. The so-called chest-voice of children is  only embryonic. It cannot be musical, for the larynx has not reached  that stage of growth and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#4)"],[1,"all of the said officers.\"[8]    [Footnote 8: \"The clause directing the governor to _nominate_ officers  to the Legislature for their approbation being read and debated, was  generally disapproved. Many other methods were devised by different  members, and mentioned to the house merely for consideration. I  mentioned several myself, and told the convention at the time, that,  however I might then incline to adopt them, I was not certain, but  that after considering them, I should vote for their rejection. While  the minds of the members were thus fluctuating between various  opinions, I spent the evening of that day with Mr. Morris at your  lodgings, in the course of which I proposed the plan for the  institution of the Council as it now stands, and after conversing on  the subject we agreed to bring it into the house the next day. It was  moved and debated and carried.\"--John Jay, _Correspondence and Public  Papers_, Vol. 1, p. 128. Letter of Jay to Robert R. Livingston and  Gouverneur Morris, April 29, 1777.]    This provision was simply, as the sequel showed, a bungling  compromise. Jay intended that the governor should nominate and the  Council confirm, and in the event of a tie the governor should have  the casting vote. But in practice it subordinated the governor to the  Council whenever a majority of the Assembly was politically opposed to  him, and the annual election of the Council greatly increased the  chances of such opposition. When, finally, the Council of Appointment  set up the claim that the right to nominate was vested concurrently in  the governor and in each of the four senators, it practically stripped  the chief executive of power.    The anomaly of the Constitution was the absence of provision for the  judicature, the third co-ordinate branch of the government. One court  was created for the trial of impeachments and the correction of  errors, but the great courts of original jurisdiction, the Supreme  Court and the Court of Chancery, as well as the probate court, the  county court, and the court of admiralty, were not mentioned except  incidentally in sections limiting the ages of the judges, the offices  each might hold, and the appointment of clerks. Instead of recreating  these courts, the Constitution simply recognised them as existing. The  new court established, known as the Court of Errors and Impeachment,  consisted of the president of the Senate, the senators, the  chancellor, and the three judges of the Supreme Court, or a major part  of them. The conception of vesting supreme appellate jurisdiction in  the upper legislative house was derived from the former practice of  appeals to the Council of the Province,[9] which possessed judicial  as well as legislative power. The Constitution further followed the  practice of the old Council by providing that judges could not vote on  appeals from their own judgments, although they might deliver  arguments in support of the same--a custom which had obtained in New  York from the earliest times.[10]    [Footnote 9: _Memorial History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.  612.]    [Footnote 10: _Duke's Laws_, Vol. 1, Chap. 14.]    In like manner provincial laws, grants of lands and charters, legal  customs, and popular rights, most of which had been in existence for a  century, were carried over. The Constitution simply provided, in a  general way, for the continuance of such parts of the common law of  England, the statute law of England and Great Britain, and the acts of  the legislature of the Colony of New York, as did not yield obedience  to the government exercised by Great Britain, or establish any  particular denomination of Christians, or their priests or ministers,  who were debarred from holding any civil or military office under the  new State; but acts of attainder for crimes committed after the close  of the war were abrogated, with the declaration that such acts should  not work a corruption of the blood.    The draft of the Constitution in Jay's handwriting was reported to the  convention on March 12, 1777, and on the following day the first  section was accepted. Then the debate began. Sixty-six members  constituted the convention, a majority of whom, led by John Morin  Scott, believed in the reign of the people. The spirit that nerved a  handful of men to embargo vessels and seize munitions of war covered  by British guns never wanted courage, and this historic band now  prepared to resist a conservatism that seemed disposed simply to  change the name of their masters. Jay understood this feeling. \"It is  probable that the convention was ultra-democratic,\" says William Jay,  in the biography of his father, \"for I have heard him observe that  another turn of the winch would have cracked the cord.\"[11]    [Footnote 11: William Jay, _Life of John Jay; Jay MSS._, Vol. 1, p.  72.]    Jay was not without supporters. Conservatives like the Livingstons,  the Morrises, and the Yateses never acted with the recklessness of  despair. They had well-formed notions of a popular government, and  their replies to proposed changes broke the force of the opposition.  But Jay, relying more upon his own policy, prudently omitted several  provisions that seemed to him important, and when discussion developed  their need, he shrewdly introduced them as amendments. Upon one  question, however, a prolonged and spirited debate occurred. This  centred upon the freedom of conscience. The Dutch of New Netherland,  almost alone among the Colonies, had never indulged in fanaticism, and  the Constitution, breathing the spirit of their toleration, declared  that \"the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and  worship without diminution or preference shall forever hereafter be  allowed within the State to all mankind.\" Jay did not dissent from  this sentiment; but, as a descendant of the persecuted Huguenots, he  wished to except Roman Catholics until they should deny the Pope's  authority to absolve citizens from their allegiance and to grant  spiritual absolution, and he forcefully insisted upon and secured the  restriction that \"the liberty of conscience hereby granted shall not  be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify  practices inconsistent with the safety of the State.\" The question of  the naturalisation of foreigners renewed the contention. Jay's  Huguenot blood was still hot, and again he exacted the limitation that  all persons, before naturalisation, shall \"abjure and renounce all  allegiance to all and every foreign king, prince, potentate, and  state, in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil.\"    Jay intended reporting other amendments--one requiring a similar  renunciation on the part of all persons holding office, and one  abolishing domestic slavery. But before the convention adjourned he  was, unfortunately, summoned to the bedside of his dying mother.  Otherwise, New York would probably have had the distinction of being  first to set the example of freedom. \"I should have been for a clause  against the continuance of domestic slavery,\" he said, in a letter  objecting to what occurred after his forced retirement.[12]    [Footnote 12: John Jay, _Correspondence and Public Papers_, Vol. 1, p.  126. \"Such a recommendation was introduced by Gouverneur Morris and  passed, but subsequently omitted.\"--_Ibid._, p. 136, _note_.]    Although the Constitution was under consideration for more than a  month, haste characterised the close of the convention's  deliberations. As soon as Jay left, every one seemed eager to get  away, and on Sunday, April 20, 1777, the Constitution was adopted as a  whole practically as he left it, and a committee appointed to report a  plan for establishing a government under it. Unlike the Constitution  of Massachusetts, it was not submitted to the voters for ratification.  The fact that the delegates themselves had been elected by the people  seemed sufficient, and two days after its passage, the secretary of  the convention, standing upon a barrel in front of the courthouse at  Kingston, published it to the world by reading it aloud to those who  happened to be present. As it became known to the country, it was  cordially approved as the most excellent and liberal of the American  constitutions. \"It is approved even in New England,\" wrote Jay, \"where  few New York productions have credit.\"[13]    [Footnote 13: _Ibid._, p. 140.]    The absence of violent democratic innovations was the Constitution's  remarkable feature. Although a product of the Revolution, framed to  meet the necessities growing out of that great event, its general  provisions were decidedly conservative. The right of suffrage was so  restricted that as late as 1790 only 1303 of the 13,330 male residents  of New York City possessed sufficient property to entitle them to vote  for governor. Even the Court of Chancery remained undisturbed,  notwithstanding royal governors had created it in opposition to the  wishes of the popular assembly. But despite popular dissatisfaction,  which evidenced itself in earnest prayers and ugly protests, the  instrument, so rudely and hastily published on April 22, 1777,  remained the supreme law of the State for forty-four years.    Before adjournment the convention, adopting the report of its  committee for the organisation of a state government, appointed Robert  R. Livingston, chancellor; John Jay, chief justice of the Supreme  Court; Robert Yates, Jr., and John Sloss Hobart, justices of the  Supreme Court, and Egbert Benson, attorney-general. To a Council of  Safety, composed of fifteen delegates, with John Morin Scott,  chairman, were confided all the powers of the State until superseded  by a regularly elected governor.
