They do not appear to have any vineyards: those who want wine      buy it of their neighbours; but most of them drink only milk.        [1] Around the modern town of Tirnova.    A contemporary of the saintly Ulfilas (who surely should be accepted as  the first national hero of the Bulgarians) states that Ulfilas had  originally lived on the other side of the Danube and had been driven by  persecution to settle in Bulgaria. This contemporary, Auxentius,  records:        And when, through the envy and mighty working of the enemy,      there was kindled a persecution of the Christians by an      irreligious and sacrilegious Judge of the Goths, who spread      tyrannous affright through the barbarian land, it came to pass      that Satan, who desired to do evil, unwillingly did good; that      those whom he sought to make deserters became confessors of the      faith; that the persecutor was conquered, and his victims wore      the wreath of victory. Then, after the glorious martyrdom of      many servants and handmaids of Christ, as the persecution still      raged vehemently, after seven years of his episcopate were      expired, the blessed Ulfilas being driven from \"Varbaricum\" with      a great multitude of confessors, was honourably received on the      soil of Roumania by the Emperor Constantius of blessed memory.      Thus as God by the hand of Moses delivered His people from the      violence of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and made them pass      through the Red Sea, and ordained that they should serve Him [on      Mount Sinai], even so by means of Ulfilas did God deliver the      confessors of His only-begotten Son from the \"Varbarian\" land,      and cause them to cross over the Danube, and serve Him upon the      mountains [of Haemus] like his saints of old.    Ulfilas civilised as well as Christianised the Goths of Bulgaria, and  was responsible for the earliest Gothic alphabet--the Moeso-Gothic. He  translated most of the Scriptures into Gothic, leaving out of his  translation only such war stories as \"the Book of Kings,\" judging that  these would be too exciting for his Gothic flock and would incite them  to war.    [Illustration: A SHOP WOMAN OF THE DISTRICT OF SOFIA]    After a century of peace war broke out again between the Goths and the  Roman Empire--which may now be called rather the Greek Empire--in A.D.  369. The course of the war was at first favourable to the Emperor  Valens. All the independent Goths were driven back behind the Danube  boundary, but were allowed to live there in peace. The Roman orator  Themistius, in congratulating the Emperor Valens, put on record the  extent of his achievement and of his magnanimity:        But now, along almost all the frontiers of the Empire, peace      reigns, and all the preparation for war is perfect; for the      Emperor knows that they most truly work for peace who thoroughly      prepare for war. The Danube-shore teems with fortresses, the      fortresses with soldiers, the soldiers with arms, the arms both      beautiful and terrible. Luxury is banished from the legions, but      there is an abundance of all necessary stores, so that there is      now no need for the soldier to eke out his deficient rations by      raids on the peaceful villagers. There was a time when the      legions were terrible to the provincials, and afraid of the      barbarians. Now all that is changed: they despise the barbarians      and fear the complaint of one plundered husbandman more than an      innumerable multitude of Goths.        To conclude, then, as I began. We celebrate this victory by      numbering not our slaughtered foes but our living and tamed      antagonists. If we regret to hear of the entire destruction even      of any kind of animal, if we mourn that elephants should be      disappearing from the province of Africa, lions from Thessaly,      and hippopotami from the marshes of the Nile, how much rather,      when a whole nation of men, barbarians it is true, but still      men, lies prostrate at our feet, confessing that it is entirely      at our mercy, ought we not instead of extirpating, to preserve      it, and make it our own by showing it compassion?    Valens restored Bulgaria to the position of a wholly Roman province,  even the Gothic Minores being driven across the Danube. But there was  now to come another racial element into the making of Bulgaria--the  Huns.    I can still recall the resentment and indignation of the Bulgarian  officers in 1913 because a French war correspondent had, in a despatch  which had escaped the Censor, likened the crossing of the Thracian Plain  by the great convoys of Bulgarian ox-wagons to the passage of the Danube  by the Huns in the fourth century. The Bulgarians, always inclined to be  sensitive, thought that the allusion made them out to be barbarians. But  it was intended rather, I think, to show the writer's knowledge of the  early history of the Balkan Peninsula and of the close racial ties  between the Bulgarians of to-day and the original Huns. We have seen how  the Gothic invasion, coming from the Baltic to the Black Sea, pushed on  to the borders of the Hun people living east of the Volga. These Huns  now prepared an answering wave of invasion.    To the Goths the Huns--the first of the Tartar hordes to invade  Europe--were a source of superstitious terror. The Gothic historian  Jordanes writes with frank horror of them:        We have ascertained that the nation of the Huns, who surpassed      all others in atrocity, came thus into being. When Filimer,      fifth king of the Goths, after their departure from Sweden, was      entering Scythia, with his people, as we have before described,      he found among them certain sorcerer-women, whom they call in      their native tongue Haliorunnas, whom he suspected and drove      forth from his army into the wilderness. The unclean spirits      that wander up and down in desert places, seeing these women,      made concubines of them; and from this union sprang that most      fierce people, the Huns, who were at first little, foul,      emaciated creatures, dwelling among the swamps and possessing      only the shadow of human speech by way of language.        According to Priscus they settled first on the eastern shore of      the Sea of Azof, lived by hunting, and increased their substance      by no kind of labour, but only by defrauding and plundering      their neighbours.        Once upon a time when they were out hunting beside the Sea of      Azof, a hind suddenly appeared before them, and having entered      the water of that shallow sea, now stopping, now dashing      forward, seemed to invite the hunters to follow on foot. They      did so, through what they had before supposed to be trackless      sea with no land beyond it, till at length the shore of Scythia      lay before them. As soon as they set foot upon it, the stag that      had guided them thus far mysteriously disappeared. This, I trow,      was done by those evil spirits that begat them, for the injury      of the Goths. But the hunters who had lived in complete      ignorance of any other land beyond the Sea of Azof were struck      with admiration of the Scythian land and deemed that a path      known to no previous age had been divinely revealed to them.      They returned to their comrades to tell them what had happened,      and the whole nation resolved to follow the track thus opened      out before them. They crossed that vast pool, they fell like a      human whirlwind on the nations inhabiting that part of Scythia,      and offering up the first tribes whom they overcame, as a      sacrifice to victory, suffered the others to remain alive, but      in servitude.        With the Alani especially, who were as good warriors as      themselves, but somewhat less brutal in appearance and manner of      life, they had many a struggle, but at length they wearied out      and subdued them. For, in truth, they derived an unfair      advantage from the intense hideousness of their countenances.      Nations whom they would never have vanquished in fair fight fled      horrified from those frightful--faces I can hardly call them,      but rather--shapeless black collops of flesh, with little points      instead of eyes. No hair on their cheeks or chins gives grace to      adolescence or dignity to age, but deep furrowed scars instead,      down the sides of their faces, show the impress of the iron      which with characteristic ferocity they apply to every male      child that is born among them, drawing blood from its cheeks      before it is allowed its first taste of milk. They are little in      stature, but lithe and active in their motions, and especially      skilful in riding, broad-shouldered, good at the use of the bow      and arrows, with sinewy necks, and always holding their heads      high in their pride. To sum up, these beings under the form of      man hide the fierce nature of the beast.    That was a view very much coloured by race prejudice and the  superstitious fears of the time. It suggests that at a very early period  of Balkan history the different races there had learned how to abuse one  another. English readers might contrast it with Matthew Arnold's picture  of a Tartar camp in _Sohrab and Rustum_:          The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog      From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.

In the chronicles of the Abbey the following facts are recorded:--    In 1218 the dormitory roof fell down upon the monks when they returned  from an early service, and Gilbert, a monk, had a thigh broken and his  head injured, while the Prior Gunfrey escaped unhurt.    In 1224, Robert Travers, Bishop of Kildelo (_i.e._ Killaloe), in the  winter dedicated two large bells in the tower.    In 1234 the principal gate of the monastery and two stables were burnt  down.    In 1237, Hervey de Sipton, the then Prior, pulled down and rebuilt the  chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas. Nothing can be said definitely as to  its size, owing to the later work done in this part. The chronicle,  however, distinctly states that divine service was first held in Prior  Sipton's new chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas, on St. Nicholas'  Day.[2]    The roof bears the arms of the Clares and Despensers, and this would  give the date of the bosses as 1321-1337, _i.e._, about a century  later than the date of the chapel.    The two chapels which are now usually known as those of St. James and  St. Nicholas were, at one time, supposed, without authority, to have  been the chapter-house of the monastery. They were so described as  recently as 1881, in the plan used by the members of the Architectural  Association for their excursion to Tewkesbury. For many years they  were in use as a grammar school, and were walled off from the rest of  the church.    In 1239 a grand altar was dedicated to the honour of the Virgin,  \"gloriosae Virginis Mariae.\" This is by some supposed to refer to the  present altar-stone of Purbeck marble.    In 1241, Oct. 25, the body of Fitz-Hamon, the founder of the existing  fabric, was brought in from the Chapter House and placed on the site  of the Founder's Chapel built later.    In 1243 the dormitory, which had been rebuilt (chiefly by Abbot  Peter), was re-opened for use.    In 1246 the Prior, Henry de Banbury, built an Early English Chapel,  dedicated to St. Eustachius. It seems probable that this was erected  on the site of the apsidal Norman chapel, and the space (6 feet)  between it and the Early English chapel. The vaulting corbels are all  that remain.    In 1259 the Chapter-House was newly paved at the expense of the  Convent.    The chronicles, as reprinted in \"Annales Monastici\" stop short in  1263, and from that time onwards there is a dearth of direct  information as to the Abbey and its history.    The choir was altered in the time of Abbot Parker, by Elizabeth, the  wife, successively, of Lord Badlesmere, of Hugh Lord Despenser, and  Sir Guy de Brien. The original Norman clerestory was taken down and  the Norman columns of the choir slightly raised, as will be seen from  the choir aisle on the side where the original capitals were left  unaltered. At the same time the beautiful series of apsidal chapels  was added; stone vaulting took the place of the earlier wooden  roofing and the space between the four piers that support the tower  was vaulted. This work contains the arms of Sir Guy and of the  Montacutes.    1397. The Founder's Chapel was erected by Abbot Parker.    In 1422 Henry VI. granted the patronage of Deerhurst Priory to  Tewkesbury. Much litigation followed with Eton College in consequence,  but in 1469 the grant was confirmed and carried out by John Carpenter,  Bishop of Worcester.    On May 30, 1471, the Abbey, which had been polluted with blood during  the battle of Tewkesbury, and had not been available for divine  service for a month, was cleansed with special ceremony by the Bishop  of Down and Connor, who was acting as suffragan to the Bishop of  Worcester and reconsecrated.    At the Dissolution the whole establishment, which, from the lists of  what was to be kept and what was to be destroyed, was of considerable  size, was seized by the King's Commissioners. The houses and buildings  assigned to remain \"undefaced\" were \"The lodging called the New Warke,  leading from the gate to the late Abbot's lodging, with buttery,  pantry, cellar, kitching, larder, and pastry thereto adjoining; the  late Abbot's lodging; the hostery; the great gate entering into the  court, with the lodging over the same; the Abbot's stable, bakehouse,  brewhouse and slaughter-house, the almery, barn, dairy-house; the  great barn next Avon; the malting-house with the garners in the same,  the ox-house in the Barton, the Barton-gate and the lodging over the  same.\" At the same time \"the Church, with chapels, cloisters, chapter  house, misericord; the two dormitories, infirmary with chapels and  lodgings within the same; the workhouse, with another house adjoining  to the same; the convent kitchen; the library; the old hostery; the  chamberer's lodgings; the new hall; the old parlour adjoining to the  Abbot's lodging; the cellarer's lodging; the poulter house: the  gardner; the almary, and all other houses and lodgings not otherwise  reserved,\" were \"deemed to be superfluous\" and were committed to the  custody of Sir John Whittington.    The eight bells in the tower were estimated at 146 cwt., and were  ordered to be melted down, as was also the lead upon the roofs of the  choir, the aisles and the chapels annexed, the cloister, chapter  house, frater, St. Michael's Chapel, halls, farmery and gatehouse. The  weight of lead was estimated at 180 fodders, _i.e._, about 190 tons.    The jewels naturally were specially reserved to the use of the King's  Majesty, and the two mitres garnished with gilt, rugged pearls, and  counterfeit stones, and 1,431 ounces of silver and silver-gilt plate  were, together with the vestments, ornaments, and everything else of  value, taken away.    The public-spirited inhabitants of Tewkesbury, however, meant to  preserve their cherished Abbey from destruction if they could compass  it, and after petitioning their \"most dread victorious sovereign  lord,\" succeeded in doing so for a consideration, viz., the sum of  L453. This sum was arrived at by roughly valuing the lead on the roofs  at 5d. a square foot, and the bells at something like 2-1/2d. per lb.  They had to pay L200 down, L100 the ensuing Easter, and the balance,  L153, at Christmas. It was further stipulated that the said  parishioners should \"bear and find the reparations of the said church  perpetually.\"    The word \"church\" in this connection seems to be limited to mean that  part of the building other than the nave. The nave seems to have been  looked upon as belonging, as was the case elsewhere, to the  inhabitants of Tewkesbury, for their use, more or less as a parish  church. Mr. Hayman says that \"parochial worship was enshrined there  side by side with the monastic, far in the past, before its  re-foundation in the eleventh century.... This parochial constitution  survived the great successive shocks of change which altered or  cancelled everything else. The change from Saxon to Norman, the havoc  of civil war, the concentration of power in the Tudor crown, the  Dissolution itself, and the Reformation which followed, all left this  as they found it, or left it stronger still. To this constitution  alone the noble church was indebted for its preservation. The King  could grasp all else from pinnacle to basement, but the nave was the  parishioners', and that he could not touch. The result is a church  surviving entire and substantially as its vanished patrons and  banished brethren left it. Therefore if this church is a monument of  baronial and abbatial power long departed, it is yet more so of the  strength of the popular principle, and of the vitality of the  parochial system which survives.\"    In the same way the good people of Great Malvern, or Moche Malverne as  it was then termed, clubbed together and bought the Priory Church for  L200, to serve as their parish church in place of the older parish  church, which then, after two hundred and fifty years' use, was in  need of repair. Their Lady Chapel, cloisters, dormitories, Chapter  House, &c., were rased to the ground, and all that had a market value  was sold.    After the purchase of the church by the good people of Tewkesbury, the  nave seems to have been utterly neglected, and only used for purposes  of burial and for the occasional performances of stage-plays. Such  plays were acted in 1578, 1584, 1585, as is shown by items which  appear in the list of \"church goods,\" as \"sheepe skins for Christ's  garments,\" \"shippe skins for the sinners gear,\" \"eight heads of heare  for the Apostles and ten beardes,\" together with a \"face or vizor for  the devil.\"    In 1559, on Easter morning, during divine service, the wooden spire  fell down, causing damage to the tower masonry in its fall. This  steeple may have been the original one which had been put up by  Robert, the first Earl of Gloucester.    In 1576 the two chapels of St. James and St. Nicholas were cut off  from the church and turned into a free school.    In 1582 the campanile, which stood on the north side of the church not  far from the North Transept, was converted into a House of Correction  for half the shire.    In 1593 the Corporation records state that the long roof was taken  down, and replaced in the following year. Six years later there is  another interesting entry as follows: \"The churchwardens after  Michaelmas, intending of themselves to build a battlement upon the top  of the church tower, offered to do the same without any charge, and  for that purpose did set forth three stage-plays, played in the Abbey  at Whitsuntide following.\"    To raise more money they then proposed to hold a Church Ale, but there  were difficulties in the way, and the proposal was dropped.    The cost of the battlements was L66. These same churchwardens, with  the help of others, \"joined in entreating the benevolence of the best  disposed of the inhabitants, and thereby finished the free school by  glazing the windows, boarding the floors, and making the galleries.\"    In 1602 the monks' stalls, which"]]]
