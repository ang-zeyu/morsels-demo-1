Now when they were ready for the holm, Thororm asked what sort of a  sword it was that he had. Gunnlaug unsheathed it and showed him, but  had a loop round the handle of the king's sword, and slipped it over  his hand; the bearserk looked on the sword, and said, \"I fear not that  sword.\"    But now he dealt a blow on Gunnlaug with his sword, and cut off from him  nigh all his shield; Gunnlaug smote in turn with the king's gift; the  bearserk stood shieldless before him, thinking he had the same weapon he  had shown him, but Gunnlaug smote him his deathblow then and there.    The king thanked him for this work, and he got much fame therefor, both  in England and far and wide elsewhere.    In the spring, when ships sailed from land to land, Gunnlaug prayed King  Ethelred for leave to sail somewhither; the king asks what he was about  then. Gunnlaug said, \"I would fulfil what I have given my word to do,\"  and sang this stave withal:--              \"My ways must I be wending            Three kings' walls to see yet,            And earls twain, as I promised            Erewhile to land-sharers.            Neither will I wend me            Back, the worms'-bed lacking,            By war-lord's son, the wealth-free,            For work done gift well given.\"    \"So be it, then, skald,\" said the king, and withal he gave him a ring  that weighed six ounces; \"but,\" said he, \"thou shalt give me thy word to  come back next autumn, for I will not let thee go altogether, because of  thy great prowess.\"          CHAPTER VIII.     Of Gunnlaug in Ireland.    Thereafter Gunnlaug sailed from England with chapmen north to Dublin. In  those days King Sigtrygg Silky-beard, son of King Olaf Kvaran and Queen  Kormlada, ruled over Ireland; and he had then borne sway but a little  while. Gunnlaug went before the king, and greeted him well and worthily.  The king received him as was meet. Then Gunnlaug said, \"I have made a  song on thee, and I would fain have silence therefor.\"    The king answered, \"No men have before now come forward with songs for  me, and surely will I hearken to thine.\" Then Gunnlaug brought the song,  whereof this is the burden,--              \"Swaru's steed            Doth Sigtrygg feed.\"    And this is therein also:--              \"Praise-worth I can            Well measure in man,            And kings, one by one--            Lo here, Kvararis son!            Gruageth the king            Gift of gold ring?            I, singer, know            His wont to bestow.            Let the high king say,            Heard he or this day,            Song drapu-measure            Dearer a treasure?\"    The king thanked him for the song, and called his treasurer to him, and  said, \"How shall the song be rewarded?\"    \"What hast thou will to give, lord?\" says he.    \"How will it be rewarded if I give him two ships for it?\" said the king.    Then said the treasurer, \"This is too much, lord; other kings give in  regard of songs good keepsakes, fair swords, or golden rings.\"    So the king gave him his own raiment of new scarlet, a gold-embroidered  kirtle, and a cloak lined with choice furs, and a gold ring which  weighed a mark. Gunnlaug thanked him well.    He dwelt a short time here, and then went thence to the Orkneys.    Then was lord in Orkney, Earl Sigurd, the son of Hlodver; he was  friendly to Icelanders. Now Gunnlaug greeted the earl well, and said he  had a song to bring him. The earl said he would listen thereto, since he  was of such great kin in Iceland.    Then Gunnlaug brought the song; it was a shorter lay, and well done. The  earl gave him for lay-reward a broad axe, all inlaid with silver, and  bade him abide with him.    Gunnlaug thanked him both for his gift and his offer, but said he was  bound east for Sweden; and thereafter he went on board ship with chapmen  who sailed to Norway.    In the autumn they came east to King's Cliff, Thorkel, his kinsman,  being with him all the time. From King's Cliff they got a guide up to  West Gothland, and came upon a cheaping-stead, called Skarir: there  ruled an earl called Sigurd, a man stricken in years. Gunnlaug went  before him, and told him he had made a song on him; the earl gave a  willing ear hereto, and Gunnlaug brought the song, which was a shorter  lay.    The earl thanked him, and rewarded the song well, and bade him abide  there that winter.    Earl Sigurd had a great Yule-feast in the winter, and on Yule-eve came  thither men sent from Earl Eric of Norway, twelve of them together, and  brought gifts to Earl Sigurd. The earl made them good cheer, and bade  them sit by Gunnlaug through the Yule-tide; and there was great mirth at  drinks.    Now the Gothlanders said that no earl was greater or of more fame than  Earl Sigurd; but the Norwegians thought that Earl Eric was by far the  foremost of the two. Hereon would they bandy words, till they both took  Gunnlaug to be umpire in the matter.    Then he sang this stave:--              \"Tell ye, staves of spear-din,            How on sleek-side sea-horse            Oft this earl hath proven            Over-toppling billows;            But Eric, victory's ash-tree,            Oft hath seen in east-seas            More of high blue billows            Before the bows a-roaring.\"    Both sides were content with his finding, but the Norwegians the best.  But after Yule-tide those messengers left with gifts of goodly things,  which Earl Sigurd sent to Earl Eric.    Now they told Earl Eric of Gunnlaug's finding: the earl thought that he  had shown upright dealing and friendship to him herein, and let out some  words, saying that Gunnlaug should have good peace throughout his land.  What the earl had said came thereafter to the ears of Gunnlaug.    But now Earl Sigurd gave Gunnlaug a guide east to Tenthland, in Sweden,  as he had asked.          CHAPTER IX. Of the Quarrel between Gunnlaug and Raven before the Swedish King.    In those days King Olaf the Swede, son of King Eric the Victorious, and  Sigrid the High-counselled, daughter of Skogul Tosti, ruled over Sweden.  He was a mighty king and renowned, and full fain of fame.    Gunnlaug came to Upsala towards the time of the Thing of the Swedes in  spring-tide; and when he got to see the king, he greeted him. The  king took his greeting well, and asked who he was. He said he was an  Iceland-man.    Then the king called out: \"Raven,\" says he, \"what man is he in Iceland?\"    Then one stood up from the lower bench, a big man and a stalwart, and  stepped up before the king, and spake: \"Lord,\" says he, \"he is of good  kin, and himself the most stalwart of men.\"    \"Let him go, then, and sit beside thee,\" said the king.    Then Gunnlaug said, \"I have a song to set forth before thee, king, and I  would fain have peace while thou hearkenest thereto.\"    \"Go ye first, and sit ye down,\" says the king, \"for there is no leisure  now to sit listening to songs.\"    So they did as he bade them.    Now Gunnlaug and Raven fell a-talking together, and each told each of  his travels. Raven said that he had gone the summer before from Iceland  to Norway, and had come east to Sweden in the forepart of winter. They  soon got friendly together.    But one day, when the Thing was over, they were both before the king,  Gunnlaug and Raven.    Then spake Gunnlaug, \"Now, lord, I would that thou shouldst hear the  song.\"    \"That I may do now,\" said the king.    \"My song too will I set forth now,\" says Raven.    \"Thou mayst do so,\" said the king.    Then Gunnlaug said, \"I will set forth mine first if thou wilt have it  so, king.\"    \"Nay,\" said Raven, \"it behoveth me to be first, lord, for I myself came  first to thee.\"    \"Whereto came our fathers forth, so that my father was the little boat  towed behind? Whereto, but nowhere?\" says Gunnlaug. \"And in likewise  shall it be with us.\"    Raven answered, \"Let us be courteous enough not to make this a matter of  bandying of words. Let the king rule here.\"    The king said, \"Let Gunnlaug set forth his song first, for he will not  be at peace till he has his will.\"    Then Gunnlaug set forth the song which he had made to King Olaf, and  when it was at an end the king spake. \"Raven,\" says he, \"how is the song  done?\"    \"Right well,\" he answered; \"it is a song full of big words and little  beauty; a somewhat rugged song, as is Gunnlaug's own mood.\"    \"Well, Raven, thy song,\" said the king.    Raven gave it forth, and when it was done the king said, \"How is this  song made, Gunnlaug?\"    \"Well it is, lord,\" he said; \"this is a pretty song, as is Raven himself  to behold, and delicate of countenance. But why didst thou make a short  song on the king, Raven? Didst thou perchance deem him unworthy of a  long one?\"    Raven answered, \"Let us not talk longer on this; matters will be taken  up again, though it be later.\"    And thereat, they parted.    Soon after Raven became a man of King Olaf's, and asked him leave to  go away. This the king granted him. And when Raven was ready to go, he  spake to Gunnlaug, and said, \"Now shall our friendship be ended, for  that thou must needs shame me here before great men; but in time to come  I shall cast on thee no less shame than thou hadst will to cast on me  here.\"    Gunnlaug answers: \"Thy threats grieve me nought. Nowhere are we likely  to come where I shall be thought less worthy than thou.\"    King Olaf gave to Raven good gifts at parting, and thereafter.          CHAPTER X.     How Raven came home to Iceland, and asked for Helga to Wife.    Now this spring Raven came from the east to Thrandheim, and fitted out  his ship, and sailed in the summer to Iceland. He brought his ship to  Leiruvag, below the Heath, and his friends and kinsmen were right fain  of him. That winter he was at home with his father, but the summer after  he met at the Althing his kinsman, Skapti the law-man.    Then said Raven to him, \"Thine aid would I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#4)"],[1,"to  Emigrants--Glowing Pictures of Salt Lake Valley--The Perpetual  Emigrating Fund--Details of the Emigration System    IV.
