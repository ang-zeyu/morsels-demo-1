But he does take to it  as the easiest way of getting rid of those who are chasing him.  The Marsh Rabbit and the Swamp Hare are the only members of your  family in all the Great World who are fond of the water and who  are at home in it.  Now, who shall I tell you about?\"    \"Our biggest cousins,\" cried Peter and Jumper together.  \"The ones  you told us yesterday are bigger than Jumper,\" added Peter.  \"It  is hard to believe that there can be any much bigger than he.\"    Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled.  \"It is often hard to believe  things you know nothing about,\" said she.  \"Compared with these  other relatives, Jumper really isn't big at all.  He seems big to  you, Peter, but if he should meet his cousin, Snow White the Arctic  Hare, who lives way up in the Frozen North, I am quite sure Jumper  would feel small.  Snow White looks very much like Jumper in his  winter coat, for he is all white save the tips of his ears,  which are black.\"    \"Does he wear a white coat all year round?\" asked Peter eagerly.    \"When he lives so far north that there is snow and ice for most of  the year, he does,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"But when he lives  far enough south for the snow to disappear for a little while in  the summer, he changes his white coat for one of gray.\"    \"But how can he live so far north that the snow and ice seldom melt?\"  asked Peter, looking very much puzzled.  \"What can he find to eat?\"    \"Even way up there there is moss growing under the snow.  And in the  short summer other plants grow.  During the long winter Snow White  digs down through the snow to get these.  He also eats the bark and  twigs of little stunted trees.  But big as he is, you have a cousin  who is still bigger, the biggest of all the family.\"    \"Who is he?\" Jumper and Peter cried together.    \"He is called White-tailed Jack,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"And  he lives chiefly on the great plains of the Northwest, though  sometimes he is found in the mountains and forests.  He is sometimes  called the Prairie Hare.  In winter his coat is white, but in  summer it is a light brown.  Summer or winter his tail is white,  wherein he is much like you, Peter.  It is because of this that he  is called White-tailed Jack.\"    \"Is his tail as short as mine?\" asked Peter eagerly.    Old Mother Nature laughed right out.  \"No, Peter,\" she replied.  \"It wouldn't be called a long tail by any other animal, but for a  member of your family it really is long, and when White-tailed  Jack is running he switches it from side to side.  His hind legs  are very long and powerful, and he can make a single jump of twenty  feet without half trying.  Not even Old Man Coyote can catch him  in a straightaway race.  You think Jumper's ears are long, Peter,  but they are short compared to the ears of White-tailed Jack.  Not  only are his ears long, but they are very big.  When he squats in  his form and lays his ears back they reach way over his shoulders.  Like the other members of the Hare family he doesn't use holes in  the ground or hollow logs.  He trusts to his long legs and to his  wonderful speed to escape from his enemies.  Among the latter are  Howler the Wolf, Old Man Coyote, Eagles, Hawks and Owls.  He is  so big that he would make five or six of you, Peter.\"    Peter drew a long breath.  \"It is dreadfully hard to believe that  I can have a cousin as big as that,\" he exclaimed.  \"But of course  if you say it is so, it is so,\" he hastened to add.  \"Have I any  other cousins anywhere near as big?\"    Old Mother Nature nodded.  \"There are some others very like  White-tailed Jack, only not quite as big,\" said she.  \"They have  just such long hind legs, and just such great ears, but their  coats are different, and they live on the great plains farther  south.  Some of them live so far south that it is warm all the  year round.  One of these latter is Antelope Jack, whose home is  in the Southwest.\"    \"Tell us about him,\" begged Peter.    \"To begin with,\" replied Old Mother Nature, \"he is a member of the  big Jack Rabbit or Jack Hare branch of your family.  None of this  branch should be called a Rabbit.  All the members are first cousins  to Jumper and are true Hares.  All have big ears, long, rather thin  necks, and long legs.  Even their front legs are comparatively long.  Antelope Jack is probably next in size to White-tailed Jack.  Strange  to say, although he lives where it is warm for most of the year, his  coat is very largely white.  His back is a yellowish-brown and so is  his throat.  But his sides are white.  The surprising thing about  him is that he has the power of making himself seem almost wholly  white.  He can make the white hair spread out at will by means of  some special little muscles which I have given him, so that the  white of his sides at times almost seems to meet on his back.  When  he does this in the sun it makes flashes of white which can be seen  a long way.  By means of this Antelope Jack and his friends can  keep track of each other when they are a long distance apart.  There  is only one other animal who can flash signals in this way, and that  is the Antelope of whom I will tell you some other time.  It is  because Jack flashes signals in this way that he is called Antelope  Jack.  In his habits he is otherwise much like the other members of  his family.  He trusts to his long legs and his wonderful powers of  jumping to keep him out of danger.  He is not as well known as his  commoner cousin, plain Jack Rabbit.  Everybody knows Jack Rabbit.\"    Peter shook his head.  \"I don't,\" said he very meekly.    \"Then it is time you did,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"If you had  ever been in the Far West you would know him.  Everybody out there  knows him.  He isn't quite as big as Antelope Jack but still he is  a big fellow.  He wears a brownish coat much like Jumper's, and  the tips of his long ears are black.  His tail is longer than  Jumper's, and when he runs he carries it down.\"    \"I don't carry mine down,\" Peter piped up.    Old Mother Nature laughed right out.  \"True enough, Peter, true  enough,\" said she.  \"You couldn't if you wanted to.  It isn't long  enough to carry any way but up.  Jack has more of a tail than you  have, just as he has longer legs.  My, how he can run!  He goes with  great bounds and about every tenth bound he jumps very high.  This  is so that he can get a good look around to watch out for enemies.\"    \"Who are his enemies?\" asked Peter.    \"Foxes, Coyotes, Hawks, Eagles, Owls, Weasels, and men,\" replied  Old Mother Nature.  \"In fact, he has about as many enemies as  you have.\"    \"I suppose when you say men, you mean hunters,\" said Peter.    Old Mother Nature nodded.  \"Yes,\" said she, \"I mean those who hunt  him for fun and those who hunt him to get rid of him.\"    Peter pricked up his ears.  \"What do they want to get rid of him  for.  What harm does he do?\" he asked.    \"When he lives far away from the homes of men he does no harm,\"  replied Old Mother Nature.  \"But when he lives near the homes of  men he gets into mischief, just as you do when you visit Farmer  Brown's garden.\"  Old Mother Nature looked very severe when she  said this and Peter hung his head.    \"I know I ought to keep away from that garden,\" said Peter very  meekly, \"but you have no idea what a temptation it is.  The things  in that garden do taste so good.\"    Old Mother Nature turned her head to hide the twinkle in her eyes.  When she turned toward Peter again her face was severe as before.  \"That is no excuse, Peter Rabbit,\" said she.  \"You should be  sufficiently strong-minded not to yield to temptation.  Yielding  to temptation is the cause of most of the trouble in this world.  It has made man an enemy to Jack Rabbit.  Jack just cannot keep  away from the crops planted by men.  His family is very large, and  when a lot of them get together in a field of clover or young wheat,  or in a young orchard where the bark on the trees is tender and  sweet, they do so much damage that the owner is hardly to be blamed  for becoming angry and seeking to kill them.  Yes, I am sorry to  say, Jack Rabbit becomes a terrible nuisance when he goes where  he has no business.  Now I guess you have learned sufficient about  your long-legged cousins.  I've a great deal to do, so skip along  home, both of you.\"    \"If you please, Mother Nature, may we come again to-morrow?\"  asked Peter.    \"What for?\" demanded Old Mother Nature.  \"Haven't you learned enough  about your family?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Peter, \"but there are lots and lots of things I  would like to know about other people.  If you please, I would  like to come to school to you every day.  You see, the more I  learn about my neighbors, the better able I will be to take care  of myself.\"    \"All right, Mr. Curiosity,\" replied Old Mother Nature good-naturedly,  \"come again to-morrow morning.  I wouldn't for the world deny any one  who is really seeking for knowledge.\"    So Peter and Jumper politely bade her good-by and started for  their homes.        CHAPTER IV  Chatterer and Happy Jack Join    Peter Rabbit, on his way to school to Old Mother Nature, was trying  to make up his mind about which of his neighbors he would ask.  He  had learned so many surprising things about his own family that he  shrewdly suspected many equally surprising things were to be learned  about his neighbors.  But there were so many neighbors he couldn't  decide which one to ask about first.    But that matter was settled for him, and in a funny way.  Hardly  had he reached the edge of the Green Forest when he was hailed by a  sharp voice.  \"Hello, Peter Rabbit!\" said this sharp voice.  \"Where  are you bound at this hour of the morning?  You ought to be heading  for home in the dear Old Briar-patch.\"    Peter knew that voice the instant he heard it.  It was the voice of  Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel.  Happy Jack was seated on the top of  an old stump, eating a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#4)"],[1,". The changes effected must  conduce immensely to the health and comfort of the inhabitants. There is  no part of India, we suppose, free from the plague of the musquito, but  in all my Indian life I have not been so much tormented in any place by  it as I have been in Calcutta. It adds insult to injury. If it would  only bite, sharp though its bite be, one could put up with it; but  before it bites, and after, it goes on buzzing, as if mocking you, and  evades every attempt to catch it. The last time we were there musquitoes  were comparatively few, and they seemed to have lost much of their  former mischievous vigour. We suppose the improved sanitary arrangements  have not agreed with them.    When in Calcutta everything reminded us that we had left our own country  behind, though not all our own people. We saw them on every side, but  they were a mere handful in the midst of a strange people in a strange  land, where man and nature presented entirely new aspects. The look of  the people, the exceedingly scanty dress of the labouring class, and the  long flowing robes of those in better circumstances, the marks on the  foreheads and arms of the Hindus, showing the gods whose worshippers  they were, their processions with noisy, unmusical music, the public  buildings of the people, the mosques of the Muhammadans, and the temples  of the Hindus, with a church here and there to show that Christianity  had also its shrines--all brought to our view characteristics of the  great land on which we had entered. Bombay, since the opening of the  Suez Canal, has made progress which somewhat affects the pre-eminence of  Calcutta among the cities of India, but it still remains the capital of  British India--I ought rather to say of India--and its position will  continue to make it, what it has been in the past, a vast emporium of  commerce, the abode of a great population, and a place of most stirring  activity. It continues to be the resort of persons of every civilized,  and almost every semi civilized, nation on the face of the earth.    My stay in Calcutta of six weeks was longer than I had anticipated, but  my time was very pleasantly and profitably spent. A few days after  arrival a united prayer-meeting was held: missionaries of all societies  were present, the attendance was large, the spirit was earnest and  devout, and I then began to realize, what it was my happiness to realize  more fully afterwards, the uniting power of the missionary enterprise. I  had the happiness of attending services with Native Christians, and of  joining them in spirit, though not with understanding. I was especially  interested in the noble Missionary Institution of the Church of  Scotland, and in the smaller, but promising, school of our own Society.  I felt as if the sight of such a number of boys and young men, many of  them with most pleasing and intelligent countenances, all learning our  language, and, what is vastly better, all taught from the Word of God,  was enough in itself to repay one for the long voyage to India. I heard  them examined, and was surprised at the knowledge of English possessed  by some of them, at the extent of their Biblical knowledge, and at the  Christian tone with which they gave replies to questions. I asked a  tall, slightly built young man, with a most intelligent face, dressed in  the flowing white robe of his people, who had spoken with what struck me  as the accent of conviction, \"Are you a Christian?\" to which he replied,  \"Yes, in heart; but I fear persecution.\" To this subject of schools I  shall have often occasion to revert in the course of my reminiscences.    During my stay in Calcutta I had much pleasant intercourse with  missionaries of different Societies. I was the guest of Mr. Boaz,  afterwards Dr. Boaz, of Union Chapel, by whom I was treated with much  kindness. Mr. Gogerly had been my fellow-passenger to India. Mr. Lacroix  and Mr. Piffard were, at that time, the senior missionaries of our  Society in Calcutta. Both were admirable men. Mr. Piffard was a  gentleman of property, who devoted himself to missionary work, and  laboured for many years most faithfully, without requiring to take, and  without taking, any salary from the Society. A short time afterwards he  was suddenly carried off by cholera. Mr. Lacroix lived for many years. I  had the pleasure of meeting him in my visits to Calcutta, and in his  visits to the North-west, and also of frequent correspondence with him.  He was esteemed and loved as few have been. He was a man with a  commanding presence, tall and well-built, and had a geniality of manner  which won all hearts. He spoke and wrote English remarkably well, with a  slight foreign accent and sprightliness, an _elan_, as our French  friends call it, which told of his French birth and upbringing. He had a  thorough knowledge of the Bengalee language, and used it with a  commanding eloquence, to which his voice, look, and gesture greatly  contributed. His last illness, the result of his long residence in the  enervating climate of Bengal, was borne with Christian patience, and  drew forth the sympathy and kindly inquiry of all classes. At his  funeral such tokens of respect and love were rendered to him by every  class of the community, Native and European, as have been seldom  witnessed in Calcutta.    [Sidenote: SERAMPORE.]    Like all newly-arrived missionaries in Calcutta, I made a pilgrimage to  Serampore. The illustrious trio--Carey, Marshman, and Ward--whose names  are indissolubly connected with that place, as first their refuge and,  for many years afterwards, the scene of their plans and labours for the  evangelization of India, had passed away by that time (January, 1839),  but the Rev. John Mack, who had been long associated with them, and Mr.  John Marshman, Dr. Marshman's eldest son, remained. I was taken by Mr.  Mack to the college, the printing-office, the type manufactory, the  paper manufactory, the mission chapel, the station church, Dr. Carey's  garden, and the native Christian village, indeed, to every object of  interest about the place. I remember seeing an elderly man engaged in  type-making, and observing a little image in a niche above him. I was  told this man had been many years in this department of work, and had  remained so strict a Hindu that he would work only under the protection  of his god. The teaching of the missionaries had had no effect in  weaning him from his ancestral idolatry. Yet many were won to Christ by  the Scriptures and books, for the preparation of which the work of this  man, and of others of his class, was indispensable.    When visiting Serampore, and hearing from Mr. Mack of the doings and  achievements of the great men whose residence at Serampore has given it  a sacredness it will ever retain in the annals of Indian Missions, I  felt as a young Greek would feel on being taken to Marathon and  Thermopylae. I felt I was entering on a war, where there had been heroes  before me, which demanded courage and endurance of a far higher order  than had ever been enlisted in the cause of patriotism.          CHAPTER II.    VOYAGE TO BENARES.    _March, 1839._      I left myself in the hands of friends in Calcutta as to the best mode of  proceeding to my destination. There were at that time three modes of  travelling to the North-Western Provinces. One was being carried in a  palanquin on men's shoulders, arrangements being made to have fresh  bearers every few miles. For a long journey of more than four hundred  miles to Benares this was at once a very tedious and fatiguing mode of  travelling. To one who knew not a word of the language of the people in  whose hands one was to be for days it was additionally trying. Yet not a  few persons newly arrived, some of them delicate ladies, did travel in  that mode to far more distant places than Benares, and very seldom any  mishap befell them. In this mode little more could be taken in the way  of luggage than necessary clothing.    Another mode was by the river in a native boat, with a crew engaged to  take the party to their destination. Not a few travelled in this way,  even to Delhi. Weeks, often months, were spent on the voyage; great  inconveniences were endured, and not infrequently great perils  encountered from the sudden storms to which voyagers on the Ganges are  exposed, from the strong and eddying currents in some parts of the  river, and perhaps most of all from the treacherous character of the  boatmen. In 1841 and 1842 a severe storm fell on a large fleet of boats  taking a European regiment to the north-west. Many of the boats were  wrecked, and, if I remember rightly, about three hundred men lost their  lives.    There was a third mode of proceeding to the north-west. A few years  previously a River Steam Company had been formed for the transmission of  passengers and goods. Passengers were accommodated in flats drawn by  steamers. As the Ganges enters Bengal it breaks into a number of  streams, by which it makes its way to the ocean. The Hoogly, on which  Calcutta stands, is one of these streams. Some of them are so shallow at  certain seasons that native boats of considerable size cannot find  sufficient water, and they are at that time impassable for steamers,  though so constructed as to have the least possible draught. The result  is that the steamers for the north-west (we believe none ply now) had to  make a great detour, to go down the Hoogly to Saugor Island, and then to  proceed by one of the channels there found to the main stream. This  greatly increased the distance to the north-west. Except in the rainy  season, steamers for Benares had to go about eight hundred miles.    [Sidenote: THE SUNDERBUNS.]    Of these three routes this one of the river steamers was in many  respects the most convenient and pleasant, especially for persons new in  the country, and my Calcutta friends kindly arranged that I should be  sent on in this way.
