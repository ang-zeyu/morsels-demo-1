After they had got enough cherry pits, they gathered the seed of a sugar  maple that stood near. Many of the keys remained upon the tree after the  leaves had fallen, and these the squirrels harvested. They would run  swiftly out upon the ends of the small branches, reach out for the maple  keys, snip off the wings, and deftly slip the nut or samara into their  cheek pockets. Day after day in late autumn, I used to see them thus  occupied.    As I have said, I have no evidence that more than one chipmunk occupy  the same den. One March morning after a light fall of snow I saw where  one had come up out of his hole, which was in the side of our path to  the vineyard, and after a moment's survey of the surroundings had  started off on his travels. I followed the track to see where he had  gone. He had passed through my woodpile, then under the beehives, then  around the study and under some spruces and along the slope to the hole  of a friend of his, about sixty yards from his own. Apparently he had  gone in here, and then his friend had come forth with him, for there  were two tracks leading from this doorway. I followed them to a third  humble entrance, not far off, where the tracks were so numerous that I  lost the trail. It was pleasing to see the evidence of their morning  sociability written there upon the new snow.    One of the enemies of the chipmunk, as I discovered lately, is the  weasel. I was sitting in the woods one autumn day when I heard a small  cry, and a rustling amid the branches of a tree a few rods beyond me.  Looking thither I saw a chipmunk fall through the air, and catch on a  limb twenty or more feet from the ground. He appeared to have dropped  from near the top of the tree.    He secured his hold upon the small branch that had luckily intercepted  his fall, and sat perfectly still. In a moment more I saw a weasel--one  of the smaller red varieties--come down the trunk of the tree, and begin  exploring the branches on a level with the chipmunk.    I saw in a moment what had happened. The weasel had driven the squirrel  from his retreat in the rocks and stones beneath, and had pressed him  so closely that he had taken refuge in the top of a tree. But weasels  can climb trees, too, and this one had tracked the frightened chipmunk  to the topmost branch, where he had tried to seize him. Then the  squirrel had, in horror, let go his hold, screamed, and fallen through  the air, till he struck the branch as just described. Now his  bloodthirsty enemy was looking for him again, apparently relying  entirely upon his sense of smell to guide him to the game.    How did the weasel know the squirrel had not fallen clear to the ground?  He certainly did know, for when he reached the same tier of branches he  began exploring them. The chipmunk sat transfixed with fear, frozen with  terror, not twelve feet away, and yet the weasel saw him not.    Round and round, up and down, he went on the branches, exploring them  over and over. How he hurried, lest the trail get cold! How subtle and  cruel and fiendish he looked! His snakelike movements, his tenacity, his  speed!    He seemed baffled; he knew his game was near, but he could not strike  the spot. The branch, upon the extreme end of which the squirrel sat,  ran out and up from the tree seven or eight feet, and then, turning a  sharp elbow, swept down and out at right angles with its first course.    The weasel would pause each time at this elbow and turn back. It seemed  as if he knew that particular branch held his prey, and yet its  crookedness each time threw him out. He would not give it up, but went  over his course again and again.    One can fancy the feelings of the chipmunk, sitting there in plain view  a few feet away, watching his deadly enemy hunting for the clue. How his  little heart must have fairly stood still each time the fatal branch was  struck! Probably as a last resort he would again have let go his hold  and fallen to the ground, where he might have eluded his enemy a while  longer.    In the course of five or six minutes the weasel gave over the search,  and ran hurriedly down the tree to the ground. The chipmunk remained  motionless for a long time; then he stirred a little as if hope were  reviving. Then he looked nervously about him; then he had recovered  himself so far as to change his position. Presently he began to move  cautiously along the branch to the bole of the tree; then, after a few  moments' delay, he plucked up courage to descend to the ground, where I  hope no weasel has disturbed him since.    One season a chipmunk had his den in the side of the terrace above my  garden, and spent the mornings laying in a store of corn which he stole  from a field ten or twelve rods away. In traversing about half this  distance, the little poacher was exposed; the first cover on the way  from his den was a large maple, where he always brought up and took a  survey of the scene. I would see him spinning along toward the maple,  then from it by an easy stage to the fence adjoining the corn; then back  again with his booty. One morning I paused to watch him more at my  leisure. He came up out of his retreat and cocked himself up to see what  my motions meant. His forepaws were clasped to his breast precisely as  if they had been hands, and the tips of the fingers thrust into his vest  pockets. Having satisfied himself with reference to me, he sped on  toward the tree. He had nearly reached it, when he turned tail and  rushed for his hole with the greatest precipitation. As he neared it, I  saw some bluish object in the air closing in upon him with the speed of  an arrow, and, as he vanished within, a shrike brought up in front of  the spot, and with spread wings and tail stood hovering a moment, and,  looking in, then turned and went away. Apparently it was a narrow escape  for the chipmunk, and, I venture to say, he stole no more corn that  morning. The shrike is said to catch mice, but it is not known to attack  squirrels. The bird certainly could not have strangled the chipmunk, and  I am curious to know what would have been the result had he overtaken  him. Probably it was only a kind of brag on his part--a bold dash where  no risk was run. He simulated the hawk, the squirrel's real enemy, and  no doubt enjoyed the joke.      The sylvan folk seem to know when you are on a peaceful mission, and are  less afraid than usual. Did not that marmot to-day guess my errand did  not concern him as he saw me approach there from his cover in the  bushes? But, when he saw me pause and deliberately seat myself on the  stone wall immediately over his hole, his confidence was much shaken. He  apparently deliberated awhile, for I heard the leaves rustle as if he  were making up his mind, when he suddenly broke cover and came for his  hole full tilt. Any other animal would have taken to his heels and fled;  but a woodchuck's heels do not amount to much for speed, and he feels  his only safety is in his hole. On he came in the most obstinate and  determined manner, and I dare say if I had sat down in his hole would  have attacked me unhesitatingly. This I did not give him a chance to  do, and he whipped into his den beneath me with a defiant snort. Farther  on, a saucy chipmunk presumed upon my harmless character to an unwonted  degree also. I had paused to bathe my hands and face in a little trout  brook, and had set a tin cup, which I had partly filled with  strawberries as I crossed the field, on a stone at my feet, when along  came the chipmunk as confidently as if he knew precisely where he was  going, and, perfectly oblivious of my presence, cocked himself up on the  rim of the cup and proceeded to eat my choicest berries. I remained  motionless and observed him. He had eaten but two when the thought  seemed to occur to him that he might be doing better, and he began to  fill his pockets. Two, four, six, eight of my berries quickly  disappeared, and the cheeks of the little vagabond swelled. But all the  time he kept eating, that not a moment might be lost. Then he hopped off  the cup, and went skipping from stone to stone till the brook was  passed, when he disappeared in the woods. In two or three minutes he was  back again, and went to stuffing himself as before; then he disappeared  a second time, and I imagined told a friend of his, for in a moment or  two along came a bobtailed chipmunk, as if in search of something, and  passed up, and down, and around, but did not quite hit the spot.  Shortly, the first returned a third time, and had now grown a little  fastidious, for he began to sort over my berries, and to bite into them,  as if to taste their quality. He was not long in loading up, however,  and in making off again. But I had now got tired of the joke, and my  berries were appreciably diminishing, so I moved away. What was most  curious about the proceeding was, that the little poacher took different  directions each time, and returned from different ways. Was this to  elude pursuit, or was he distributing the fruit to his friends and  neighbors about, astonishing them with strawberries for lunch?    On another occasion I was much amused by three chipmunks, who seemed to  be engaged in some kind of game. It looked very much as if they were  playing tag. Round and round they would go, first one taking the lead,  then another, all good-natured and gleeful as schoolboys. There is one  thing about a chipmunk that is peculiar: he is never more than one jump  from home. Make a dive at him anywhere and in he goes. He knows where  the hole is, even when it is covered up with leaves. There is no doubt,  also, that he has his own sense of humor and fun, as what squirrel has  not? I have watched two red squirrels for a half hour coursing through  the large trees by the roadside where branches interlocked, and engaged  in a game of tag as obviously as two boys. As soon as the pursuer had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24389"],[0,"Blue-Bird Weather (#4)"],[1,"in plunging quest of nourishment, resumed a more  stately and normal posture, as though at a spoken command; and the long  ranks, swimming, and led by age and wisdom, slowly moved away into the  glittering east.    At last, off the starboard bow, the low, reedy levels of Foam Island  came into view, and in a few minutes more the dory lay in the shallows,  oars, mast, and rag stowed; and the two young people splashed busily  about in their hip boots, carrying guns, ammunition, and food into the  blind.    Then Molly Herold, standing on the mud bank, flung, one by one, a  squadron of wooden, painted, canvasback decoys into the water, where  they righted themselves, and presently rode the waves, bobbing and  steering with startling fidelity to the real things.    Then it came the turn of the real things. Marche and Molly, a struggling  bird tucked under each arm, waded out along the lanes of stools, feeling  about under the icy water until their fingers encountered the wire-cored  cords. Then, to the leg rings of each madly flapping duck and swan and  goose they snapped on the leads, and the tethered birds, released, beat  the water into foam and flapped and splashed and tugged, until, finally  reconciled, they began to souse themselves with great content, and  either mounted their stools or swam calmly about as far as their tethers  permitted.    Marche, struggling knee-deep in the water, his arms full of wildly  flapping gander, hailed Molly for instructions.    \"That's a mated bird!\" she called out to him. \"Peg him outside by  himself!\"    So Marche pegged out the furious old gander, whose name was Uncle  Dudley, and in a few minutes that dignified and insulted bird, missing  his spouse, began to talk about it.    Every wifely feeling outraged, his spouse replied loudly from the  extreme end of the inner lane, telling her husband, and every duck,  goose, and swan in the vicinity, what she thought of such an inhuman  separation.    Molly laughed, and so did Marche. Duck after duck, goose after goose,  joined indignantly in the conversation. The mallard drakes twisted their  emerald-green heads and began that low, half gurgling, half quacking  conversation in which their mottled brown and gray mates joined with  louder quacks. The geese conversed freely; but the long-necked swans  held their peace, occupied with the problem of picking to pieces the  snaps on their anklets.    \"Now,\" said Molly breathlessly, as the last madly protesting bird had  been stooled, \"let's get into the blind as soon as we can, Mr. Marche.  There may be ducks in Currituck still, and every minute counts now.\"    So Marche towed the dory around to the westward and drew it into a  channel where it might lie concealed under the reeds.    When he came across to the blind he found Molly there, seated on the  plank in the cemented pit behind the screen of reeds and rushes, laying  out for him his cartridges.    There they were, in neat rows on the rail, fives, sixes, and a few of  swanshot, ranged in front of him. And his 12-gauge, all ready, save for  the loading, lay across the pit to his right. So he dropped his booted  feet into the wooden tub where a foot-warmer lay, picked up the gun,  slid a pair of sixes into it, laid it beside him, and turned toward Miss  Herold.    The wool collar of her sweater was turned up about her delicately molded  throat and face. The wild-rose color ran riot in her cheeks, and her  eyes, sky tinted now, were wide open under the dark lashes, and the wind  stirred her hair till it rippled bronze and gold under the edge of her  shooting hood. She, too, was perfectly ready. A cheap, heavy, and rather  rusty gun lay beside her; a heap of cheap cartridges before her.    She turned, and, catching Marche's eyes, smiled adorably, with a slight  nod of comradeship. Then, the smile still faintly curving her lips, she  crossed her legs in the pit, and, warming her hands in the pockets of  her coat, leaned back, resting against the rail behind.    \"You haven't a foot-warmer,\" he said.    \"I'm not cold--only my fingers--a little--stooling those birds.\"    They spoke in low voices, under their breath.    He fished from his pocket a flat Japanese hand-warmer, lighted the  paper-cased punk, snapped it shut, and passed it to her. But she  demurred.    \"You need it yourself.\"    \"No, I'm all right. Please take it.\"    So she shyly took it, dropped it into her pocket, and rested her  shapely little hand on it. \"How delightful!\" she said presently,  shifting it to the other pocket. \"Don't you really need it, Mr. Marche?\"    \"No. Does it warm you?\"    \"It is delicious. I _was_ a little chilled.\" She drew out one bare hand  and looked at it thoughtfully. Then, with a little sigh, and quite  unconscious of his gaze, she touched her lips to the wind-roughened  skin, as though in atonement for her maltreatment of herself.    Even as it now was the shape and beauty of the hand held Marche  fascinated; it was so small, yet so firm and strong and competent, so  full of youthful character, such a delicately fashioned little hand,  and so pathetic, somehow--this woman's hand, with its fineness of  texture and undamaged purity under the chapped and cruelly bruised,  tender skin.    She pocketed it again, looking out from under the wind-blown hair  clustering from the edge of her shooting hood. \"Blue-bird weather,\" she  said, in her low and very sweet voice. \"If no birds swing in by ten  o'clock we might as well sleep until four.\"    Marche leaned forward and scanned the water and sky alternately. Nothing  stirred, save their lazily preening decoys. Uncle Dudley was still  conversing with his wife at intervals; the swans and the cygnets fed or  worried their leash snaps; the ducks paddled, or dozed on the stools,  balanced on one leg.    Far away, on Golden Bar, half a thousand wild geese floated, feeding;  beyond, like snowflakes dotting the water, a few wild swans drifted.  There were ducks, too, off Starfish Island again, but nothing flying in  the blue except a slow hawk or some wandering gull, or now and then an  eagle--sometimes a mature bird, in all the splendor of white head and  tail, sometimes a young bird, seemingly larger, and all gray from crest  to shank.    Once an eagle threatened the decoys, and Uncle Dudley swore so lustily  at him, and every duck and goose set up such a clamor, that Molly Herold  picked up her gun for the emergency. But the magnificent eagle, beating  up into the wind with bronze wings aglisten, suddenly sheered off; and,  as he passed, Marche could see his bold head turn toward the blind where  the sun had flashed him its telegraphic warning on the barrel of Molly's  lifted gun.    \"Fine!\" he whispered. \"Splendid! I'm glad you didn't kill him.\"    \"I'm glad I didn't have to,\" she said.    \"Do you think you could have?\"    She turned toward him, wondering whether he might be serious; then  smiled as he smiled.    At the same instant, coming apparently from nowhere, four canvasbacks  suddenly appeared over the clamoring decoys, so close in that, as they  came driving by the blind and rose slightly, wings bowed, Marche could  almost see their beady little eyes set in the chestnut red of the  turning heads. Mechanically his gun spoke twice; rap-rap, echoed Miss  Herold's gun, and splash! splash! down whirled two gray-and-red ducks;  then a third, uncertain, slowed down, far out beyond the decoys, and  slanted sideways to the water. The fourth went on.    \"Duffer that I am,\" said Marche good-humoredly. \"That was a clean double  of yours, Miss Herold!--clean-cut work.\"    She said, slightly knitting her straight brows: \"I should have crossed  two of them and killed the one you missed. I think I'd better get the  boat.\"    \"No, I'll go out after that kicker,\" he said, ashamed of his slovenly  work.    Five minutes later he returned with his kicker and her two ducks--great,  fat, heavy canvasbacks, beautiful in their red, black, and drab plumage.    \"What about blue-bird weather, now?\" he laughed.    But she only smiled and said, \"I'm very much afraid.\"    For a long while they sat there, alert behind their wall of rustling  reeds, watching sky and water. False alarms were not infrequent from  their decoys. Sometimes the outbreak of quacking and honking was  occasioned by some wandering gull, sometimes by a circling hawk or some  eagle loitering in mid-heaven on broad and leisurely wings, reluctant to  remain, unwilling to go; sometimes to a pair or two of widgeon or  pintails speeding eastward high in the blue. But the sparkling,  cloudless hours sped away, and no duck or goose or swan invaded the  vicinity. Only one sly old black duck dropped into the reeds far back on  the island; and Marche went after him with serious designs upon his  fraudulent old life.    When the young man returned, twenty minutes later, perfectly innocent of  duck murder, he found the girl curled up in her corner of the pit, eyes  closed, tired little head cradled in the curve of her left arm. She  waked as he slid into the blind, and smiled at him, pretending not to  have been asleep.    \"Did you get him?\"    \"No. He went off at two hundred yards.\"    \"Blue-bird weather,\" she sighed; and again they exchanged smiles. He  noticed that her eyes had somehow become exceedingly blue instead of the  clear gray which he had supposed was their color. And, after her brief  slumber, there seemed to be a sort of dewy freshness about them, and  about her slightly pink cheeks, which, at that time, he had no idea were  at all perilous to him. All he was conscious of was a sensation of  pleasure in looking at her, and a slight surprise in the revelation of  elements in her which, he began to decide, constituted real beauty.    \"That's a quaint expression--'blue-bird weather,'\" he said. \"It's a  perfect description of a spring-like day in winter. Is it a local  expression?\"    \"Yes--I think so. There's a song about it, along the coast\"--she"]]]
