Or we may illustrate this principle thus. Our bodily, external selves are  quite distinct and separate, in form, name, place, substance; our  mental selves, of finer substance, meet and part, meet and part again,  in perpetual concussion and interchange; our spiritual selves attain  true consciousness through unity, where the partition wall between us  and the Highest, between us and others, is broken down and we are  all made perfect in the One. The highest riches are possessed by all  pure souls, only when united. Thus we rise from separation to true  individuality in unity.    46. The above are the degrees of limited and conditioned spiritual  consciousness, still containing the seed of separateness.    In the four stages of perception above described, the spiritual vision  is still working through the mental and psychical, the inner genius is  still expressed through the outer, personal man. The spiritual man has  yet to come completely to consciousness as himself, in his own realm,  the psychical veils laid aside.    47. When pure perception without judicial action of the mind is  reached, there follows the gracious peace of the inner self.    We have instanced certain types of this pure perception: the poet's  divination, whereby he sees the spirit within the symbol, likeness in  things unlike, and beauty in all things; the pure insight of the true  philosopher, whose vision rests not on the appearances of life, but on  its realities; or the saint's firm perception of spiritual life and being.  All these are far advanced on the way; they have drawn near to the secret  dwelling of peace.    48. In that peace, perception is unfailingly true.    The poet, the wise philosopher and the saint not only reach a wide and  luminous consciousness, but they gain certain knowledge of  substantial reality. When we know, we know that we know. For we  have come to the stage where we know things by being them, and  nothing can be more true than being. We rest on the rock, and know  it to be rock, rooted in the very heart of the world.    49. The object of this perception is other than what is learned from the  sacred books, or by sound inference, since this perception is  particular.    The distinction is a luminous and inspiring one. The Scriptures teach  general truths, concerning universal spiritual life and broad laws, and  inference from their teaching is not less general. But the spiritual  perception of the awakened Seer brings particular truth concerning his  own particular life and needs, whether these be for himself or others.  He receives defined, precise knowledge, exactly applying to what he  has at heart.    50. The impress on the consciousness springing from this perception  supersedes all previous impressions.    Each state or field of the mind, each field of knowledge, so to speak,  which is reached by mental and emotional energies, is a psychical  state, just as the mind picture of a stage with the actors on it, is a  psychical state or field. When the pure vision, as of the poet, the  philosopher, the saint, fills the whole field, all lesser views and visions  are crowded out. This high consciousness displaces all lesser  consciousness. Yet, in a certain sense, that which is viewed as part,  even by the vision of a sage, has still an element of illusion, a thin  psychical veil, however pure and luminous that veil may be. It is the  last and highest psychic state.    51. When this impression ceases, then, since all impressions have  ceased, there arises pure spiritual consciousness, with no seed of  separateness left.    The last psychic veil is drawn aside, and the spiritual man stands with  unveiled vision, pure serene.        INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II    The first book of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras is called the Book of  Spiritual Consciousness. The second book, which we now begin, is  the Book of the Means of Soul Growth. And we must remember that  soul growth here means the growth of the realization of the spiritual  man, or, to put the matter more briefly, the growth of the spiritual  man, and the disentangling of the spiritual man from the wrappings,  the veils, the disguises laid upon him by the mind and the psychical  nature, wherein he is enmeshed, like a bird caught in a net.    The question arises: By what means may the spiritual man be freed  from these psychical meshes and disguises, so that he may stand forth  above death, in his radiant eternalness and divine power? And the  second book sets itself to answer this very question, and to detail the  means in a way entirely practical and very lucid, so that he who runs  may read, and he who reads may understand and practise.    The second part of the second book is concerned with practical  spiritual training, that is, with the earlier practical training of the  spiritual man.    The most striking thing in it is the emphasis laid on the  Commandments, which are precisely those of the latter part of the  Decalogue, together with obedience to the Master. Our day and  generation is far too prone to fancy that there can be mystical life and  growth on some other foundation, on the foundation, for example, of  intellectual curiosity or psychical selfishness. In reality, on this latter  foundation the life of the spiritual man can never be built; nor, indeed,  anything but a psychic counterfeit, a dangerous delusion.    Therefore Patanjali, like every great spiritual teacher, meets the  question: What must I do to be saved? with the age-old answer: Keep  the Commandments. Only after the disciple can say, These have I  kept, can there be the further and finer teaching of the spiritual Rules.    It is, therefore, vital for us to realize that the Yoga system, like every  true system of spiritual teaching, rests on this broad and firm  foundation of honesty, truth, cleanness, obedience. Without these,  there is no salvation; and he who practices these, even though  ignorant of spiritual things, is laying up treasure against the time to  come.        BOOK II    1. The practices which make for union with the Soul are: fervent  aspiration, spiritual reading, and complete obedience to the Master.    The word which I have rendered \"fervent aspiration\" means primarily  \"fire\"; and, in the Eastern teaching, it means the fire which gives life  and light, and at the same time the fire which purifies. We have,  therefore, as our first practice, as the first of the means of spiritual  growth, that fiery quality of the will which enkindles and illumines,  and, at the same time, the steady practice of purification, the burning  away of all known impurities. Spiritual reading is so universally  accepted and understood, that it needs no comment. The very study  of Patanjali's Sutras is an exercise in spiritual reading, and a very  effective one. And so with all other books of the Soul. Obedience to  the Master means, that we shall make the will of the Master our will,  and shall confirm in all wave to the will of the Divine, setting aside the  wills of self, which are but psychic distortions of the one Divine Will.  The constant effort to obey in all the ways we know and understand,  will reveal new ways and new tasks, the evidence of new growth of  the Soul. Nothing will do more for the spiritual man in us than this, for  there is no such regenerating power as the awakening spiritual will.    2. Their aim is, to bring soul-vision, and to wear away hindrances.    The aim of fervour, spiritual reading and obedience to the Master, is,  to bring soulvision, and to wear away hindrances. Or, to use the  phrase we have already adopted, the aim of these practices is, to help  the spiritual man to open his eyes; to help him also to throw aside the  veils and disguises, the enmeshing psychic nets which surround him,  tying his hands, as it were, and bandaging his eyes. And this, as all  teachers testify, is a long and arduous task, a steady up-hill fight,  demanding fine courage and persistent toil. Fervour, the fire of the  spiritual will, is, as we said, two-fold: it illumines, and so helps the  spiritual man to see; and it also burns up the nets and meshes which  ensnare the spiritual man. So with the other means, spiritual reading  and obedience. Each, in its action, is two-fold, wearing away the  psychical, and upbuilding the spiritual man.    3. These are the hindrances: the darkness of unwisdom, self-assertion,  lust hate, attachment.    Let us try to translate this into terms of the psychical and spiritual  man. The darkness of unwisdom is, primarily, the self-absorption of  the psychical man, his complete preoccupation with his own hopes and  fears, plans and purposes, sensations and desires; so that he fails to  see, or refuses to see, that there is a spiritual man; and so doggedly  resists all efforts of the spiritual man to cast off his psychic tyrant and  set himself free. This is the real darkness; and all those who deny the  immortality of the soul, or deny the soul's existence, and so lay out  their lives wholly for the psychical, mortal man and his ambitions, are  under this power of darkness. Born of this darkness, this psychic  self-absorption, is the dogged conviction that the psychic, personal man  has separate, exclusive interests, which he can follow for himself  alone; and this conviction, when put into practice in our life, leads to  contest with other personalities, and so to hate. This hate, again,  makes against the spiritual man, since it hinders the revelation of the  high harmony between the spiritual man and his other selves, a  harmony to be revealed only through the practice of love, that perfect  love which casts out fear.    In like manner, lust is the psychic man's craving for the stimulus of  sensation, the din of which smothers the voice of the spiritual man, as,  in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#4)"],[1,"were in course of construction, the ways and means being  found with the help of indulgences issued by various bishops, Scotch  and Irish included, over a lengthy period.[11] In 1240 the king and  the Cardinal Legate Otho attended the consecration of so much of the  new work as was then completed; and Bishop Roger was supported by the  Primate, Edmund Rich, and other prelates.    East of the cathedral was St. Faith's, one of those parish churches in  which cathedral cities are notoriously prolific--churches with  parishes of the size of an average meadow, or less.[12] Whether it be  owing to greater wealth, or to greater subdivision of property, or to  enthusiasm kindled at a religious centre, nowhere do donors and  benefactors appear to have been more numerous than in these ancient  cities, like London, Norwich, and Exeter. St. Faith's was pulled down,  and the rights of the parishioners made good by allotting to them the  new crypt underneath the site of their old church. About this time  also the vaulting was renewed throughout, and various adornments added  from time to time. In 1312 the choir was paved with marble at a cost  of fivepence per foot; and three years later the old and ruinous  steeple was superseded by a new one of wood covered with lead, rising,  according to the lowest estimate--that of Wren--to a height of 460  feet, without the cross. The cross had a \"pomel well guilt\" set on the  top, and contained relics of different saints, put there by Bishop  Gilbert de Selgrave with all due solemnity, accompanied by an  indulgence, for protection. Thus was finished Old St. Paul's, the most  magnificent church in England, meet to be the cathedral of the  capital, which London had now become.       [Illustration: MONUMENT OF JOHN OF GAUNT, DUKE OF LANCASTER.     _After Hollar._]    =Wycliffe and Gaunt.=--The Primate Sudbury and Bishop Courtenay tried  John Wycliffe at the cathedral on a charge of heresy (February 13,  1377). This was in the days of rival popes at Rome and Avignon, and  one or other or both had been described by the accused as \"Antichrist,  the proud, worldly priest of Rome, and the most cursed of clippers  and purse-kervers.\"[13] By an alliance almost as strange as that  between John and Innocent, Wycliffe found himself supported by John of  Gaunt, with whom was the Earl Marshal, Percy, Earl of Northumberland.  Wycliffe and the Duke of Lancaster had this much in common, they both  wished to confine the clergy to their strictly clerical duties, the  latter through jealousy, the former for higher reasons. An immense  concourse filled the cathedral. Courtenay was popular with the  citizens, Gaunt was not; and Percy was strongly suspected of a wish to  abolish the mayoralty, and as Earl Marshal to appoint a captain of his  own instead. During an angry altercation Gaunt whispered loudly to a  neighbour, \"Rather than I will take those words at his [Courtenay's]  hands, I would pluck the bishop by the hair out of the church.\" In the  tumult that followed this insult Gaunt and Percy with difficulty  escaped; the former fled across the river to Kennington, and his  palace at the Savoy was sacked. Yet, in spite of all this, Gaunt was  the only royal prince after the Conquest buried at St. Paul's. His  tomb under the arch on the north side of the high altar, enriched by a  noble canopy to which his spear, shield, and insignia were attached,  contained effigies of himself and of his second wife, Constance of  Castile. He had also a chantry.    =Bishop Robert de Braybroke.=--On Courtenay's translation to  Canterbury, Braybroke became bishop (1382-1404). A thoroughly  practical reformer, he held out the threat of the greater  excommunication because \"in our Cathedral not only men but women also,  not on common days alone but especially on Festivals, expose their  wares as it were in a public market, and buy and sell without  reverence for the holy place.... Others play at ball or other unseemly  games, both within and without the church, breaking the beautiful and  costly painted windows, to the amazement of the spectators.\" He also  attempted to regulate residence. Owing to the increased value of the  corporate or common property divided amongst the residentiaries or  _stagiarii_, residence was no longer reckoned a burden, but sought  after. To keep the number down to two the canons in residence would  admit no fresh colleague unless he spent during his first year from  six hundred to a thousand merks in feasting and other useless  expenditure. Braybroke put a check to this abuse, and by the  arbitration of the king the practice of Salisbury was taken as a  model.[14] It was after his death (October 15, 1414) that the Use of  St. Paul in the religious services was superseded by the Use of Sarum.    The Petty or Minor Canons now received their charter of corporation  immediately after the death of Anne of Bohemia, wife of Richard II.  Apparently when Becket's representative ventured on his dangerous  errand, deed of excommunication in hand, the canons' vicars or vicars  choral sang the services. In Braybroke's time we find a body  intermediate between the canons and their vicars. They were twelve in  number, were required to have good voices, and to understand the art  of singing, and by their charter were to pray for their royal  benefactor, as well as for the repose of the souls of his wife and  ancestors. The first ranked as Sub-dean, taking for many purposes the  dean's place in his absence, and the two next were the Cardinals. The  Sacrist, the Almoners, and the Divinity Lecturers endowed by Bishop  Richard de Gravesend and Thomas White were appointed from among them.  They enjoyed their own common hall, and elected their own warder and  steward; and two years after incorporation, drawing up their own  Statutes, provided that they were to be read in Hall every quarter,  and that no one was to shuffle his feet during the reading.[15]    The vicars choral either now or later had dwindled down to six, and  seem to have been only in minor orders. The Petty Canons had their own  endowments; but if the canons had to pay their own vicars, we need not  be surprised at this diminution.    =The Wars of the Roses.=--With this period St. Paul's is closely  associated. At St. Paul's the Yorkist leaders pledged their allegiance  to the unhappy Henry VI. on the Sacrament--only to break it. After  Barnet the dead bodies of the king-maker and his brothers were  exposed, and after Tewkesbury the murdered corpse of Henry received  similar treatment. Most striking of all is the grim figure of Richard  of Gloucester. He it was who caused Jane Shore to be put to open  penance on the ground that she had bewitched him, she \"going before  the Cross on a Sunday with a taper in her hand,\" says Stow, \"out of  all aray saue her kirtle only.\" Hastings, the successor of Edward in  her affections, was implicated with her, and his offence read from  Paul's Cross. At Paul's Cross, newly restored by the bishop, the  younger Kempe, and while the boy king was a prisoner in the palace  hard by, that worthless sycophant, Dr. Ralph Shaw, the preacher (May  19, 1483), took for his text, \"The multiplying brood of the ungodly  shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay  any fast foundations\" (Wisdom, iv. 3). His sermon went to prove to the  citizens that Richard was the only, or at least the senior, legitimate  member of the royal family. Richard was present to hear his own mother  dishonoured; and the preacher, pointing dramatically to him, argued  that, unlike his three elder brothers, he resembled the late Duke of  York. But the people showed no sympathy, would not cry \"Long live King  Richard,\" and dispersed, fearing the worst for the poor lad immured in  the bishop's palace.    =The Clergy and Services.=--We may now conveniently glance at these  important subjects. The Bishop, who appointed all the dignitaries  except the dean, was Visitor. At the great festivals he was usually  present, and the bells were rung in his honour. How the DEAN always,  or nearly so, held another stall has been already stated; how he came  to be presented by the Crown instead of elected by his brethren is  uncertain; but the Chapter somehow practically lost their right of  electing both bishop and dean, for either pope or king in effect  appointed their diocesan. The dean was visitor of the homes of the  clergy and of the chapter estates. To the four ARCHDEACONRIES of  London, Essex, Middlesex, and Colchester was afterwards added the  small one of St. Alban's on the dissolution of that important abbey,  but without a stall in the choir.[16] The office of PRECENTOR is  explained by the name. The TREASURER was responsible for the very  valuable treasures--jewels, vestments, relics, and the like--as  distinct from the moneys. Lower in rank, but in reality of greater  importance, came the CHANCELLOR. He had jurisdiction over the old  school of St. Paul's, and any others in the City with the exception of  those of St. Mary-le-Bow and St. Martin's-le-Grand, and was secretary  and keeper of the seals, receiving a pound of pepper for each deed  sealed. The thirty PREBENDARIES (or rather twenty-nine when the dean  was one) could only hold one stall each at St. Paul's, but any number  of benefices elsewhere like the higher dignitaries; and it is by no  means certain that in the thirteenth century John Mansell did not hold  three stalls at St. Paul's simultaneously among his innumerable  benefices which together, according to Matthew Paris, amounted to  4,000 merks per annum.[17] Of the prebendaries a varying minority in  residence, stagiaries (_stagiarii_, perhaps a corruption of the more  classical _stationarii_),[18] not only divided amongst themselves the  balance of the common fund, but were not above partaking of a share of  the capitular bakehouse and brewhouse. The dean, the three higher  dignitaries, and the prebendaries"]]]
