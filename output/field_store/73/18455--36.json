The following terms and abbreviations  are used throughout the entry:    Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish  and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid  rain).    Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly  to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH  scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered  alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note  - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in  New England.    Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke,  or fog.    Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting  trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that  have been cut or destroyed by fire.    Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in  fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in  particulate form.    Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.    Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance,  and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.  Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area  or volume.    Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in  various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean,  terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.    Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited  freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.    DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was  banned in the US in 1972.    Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.    Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,  and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without  planting new growth.    Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-  arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive  soils, or climate change.    Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,  shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.    Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally  anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an  over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine  species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the ocean clean\".    Ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of  organisms and their specific environments.    Effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste  which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.    Endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.    Freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.    Greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the lower  atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary  greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.    Groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often  in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source  for wells and natural springs.    Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly  and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it  forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders  economic resources.

Nothing seemed  to hide itself from that pure, searching glance when she chose to look  at you.    In their depths you might read the tokens of a rare and noble  character--a capability of loving which, once enkindled by a worthy  object, might make all things that are possible to devoted womanhood  possible to this woman, who would not count her life anything either for  the man she loved or the cause she espoused. Amelie de Repentigny will  not yield her heart without her judgment; but when she does, it will be  a royal gift--never to be recalled, never to be repented of, to the end  of her life. Happy the man upon whom she shall bestow her affection! It  will be his forever. Unhappy all others who may love her! She may pity,  but she will listen to no voice but the one which rules her heart, to  her life's end!    Both ladies were in mourning, yet dressed with elegant simplicity,  befitting their rank and position in society. The Chevalier Le Gardeur  de Tilly had fallen two years ago, fighting gallantly for his King and  country, leaving a childless widow to manage his vast domain and succeed  him as sole guardian of their orphan niece, Amelie de Repentigny, and  her brother Le Gardeur, left in infancy to the care of their noble  relatives, who in every respect treated them as their own, and who  indeed were the legal inheritors of the Lordship of Tilly.    Only a year ago, Amelie had left the ancient Convent of the Ursulines,  perfected in all the graces and accomplishments taught in the famous  cloister founded by Mere Marie de l'Incarnation for the education of  the daughters of New France, generation after generation of whom were  trained, according to her precepts, in graces of manner as well as in  the learning of the age--the latter might be forgotten; the former,  never. As they became the wives and mothers of succeeding times, they  have left upon their descendants an impress of politeness and urbanity  that distinguishes the people of Canada to this day.    Of all the crowd of fair, eager aspirants contending for honors on the  day of examination in the great school, crowns had only been awarded to  Amelie and to Angelique des Meloises--two girls equal in beauty,  grace, and accomplishments, but unlike in character and in destiny.  The currents of their lives ran smoothly together at the beginning. How  widely different was to be the ending of them!    The brother of Amelie, Le Gardeur de Repentigny, was her elder by a  year--an officer in the King's service, handsome, brave, generous,  devoted to his sister and aunt, but not free from some of the vices  of the times prevalent among the young men of rank and fortune in the  colony, who in dress, luxury, and immorality, strove to imitate the  brilliant, dissolute Court of Louis XV.    Amelie passionately loved her brother, and endeavored--not without  success, as is the way with women--to blind herself to his faults. She  saw him seldom, however, and in her solitary musings in the far-off  Manor House of Tilly, she invested him with all the perfections he did  and did not possess; and turned a deaf, almost an angry ear, to tales  whispered in his disparagement.        CHAPTER III. A CHATELAINE OF NEW FRANCE.      The Governor was surprised and delighted to encounter Lady de Tilly and  her fair niece, both of whom were well known to and highly esteemed  by him. He and the gentlemen of his suite saluted them with profound  respect, not unmingled with chivalrous admiration for noble,  high-spirited women.    \"My honored Lady de Tilly and Mademoiselle de Repentigny,\" said the  Governor, hat in hand, \"welcome to Quebec. It does not surprise, but  it does delight me beyond measure to meet you here at the head of your  loyal censitaires. But it is not the first time that the ladies of the  House of Tilly have turned out to defend the King's forts against his  enemies.\"    This he said in allusion to the gallant defence of a fort on the wild  Iroquois frontier by a former lady of her house.    \"My Lord Count,\" replied the lady, with quiet dignity, \"'tis no special  merit of the house of Tilly to be true to its ancient fame--it could not  be otherwise. But your thanks are at this time more due to these loyal  habitans, who have so promptly obeyed your proclamation. It is the  King's corvee to restore the walls of Quebec, and no Canadian may  withhold his hand from it without disgrace.\"    \"The Chevalier La Corne St. Luc will think us two poor women a weak  accession to the garrison,\" added she, turning to the Chevalier and  cordially offering her hand to the brave old officer, who had been the  comrade in arms of her husband and the dearest friend of her family.    \"Good blood never fails, my Lady,\" returned the Chevalier, warmly  grasping her hand. \"You out of place here? No! no! you are at home on  the ramparts of Quebec, quite as much as in your own drawing-room at  Tilly. The walls of Quebec without a Tilly and a Repentigny would be a  bad omen indeed, worse than a year without a spring or a summer without  roses. But where is my dear goddaughter Amelie?\"    As he spoke the old soldier embraced Amelie and kissed her cheek with  fatherly effusion. She was a prodigious favorite. \"Welcome, Amelie!\"  said he, \"the sight of you is like flowers in June. What a glorious time  you have had, growing taller and prettier every day all the time I have  been sleeping by camp-fires in the forests of Acadia! But you girls are  all alike; why, I hardly knew my own pretty Agathe when I came home. The  saucy minx almost kissed my eyes out--to dry the tears of joy in them,  she said!\"    Amelie blushed deeply at the praises bestowed upon her, yet felt glad  to know that her godfather retained all his old affection. \"Where is  Le Gardeur?\" asked he, as she took his arm and walked a few paces apart  from the throng.    Amelie colored deeply, and hesitated a moment. \"I do not know,  godfather! We have not seen Le Gardeur since our arrival.\" Then after a  nervous silence she added, \"I have been told that he is at Beaumanoir,  hunting with His Excellency the Intendant.\"    La Corne, seeing her embarrassment, understood the reluctance of her  avowal, and sympathized with it. An angry light flashed beneath his  shaggy eyelashes, but he suppressed his thoughts. He could not help  remarking, however, \"With the Intendant at Beaumanoir! I could have  wished Le Gardeur in better company! No good can come of his intimacy  with Bigot; Amelie, you must wean him from it. He should have been in  the city to receive you and the Lady de Tilly.\"    \"So he doubtless would have been, had he known of our coming. We sent  word, but he was away when our messenger reached the city.\"    Amelie felt half ashamed, for she was conscious that she was offering  something unreal to extenuate the fault of her brother--her hopes rather  than her convictions.    \"Well, well! goddaughter! we shall, at any rate, soon have the pleasure  of seeing Le Gardeur. The Intendant himself has been summoned to  attend a council of war today. Colonel Philibert left an hour ago for  Beaumanoir.\"    Amelie gave a slight start at the name; she looked inquiringly, but did  not yet ask the question that trembled on her lips.    \"Thanks, godfather, for the good news of Le Gardeur's speedy return.\"  Amelie talked on, her thoughts but little accompanying her words as  she repeated to herself the name of Philibert. \"Have you heard that the  Intendant wishes to bestow an important and honorable post in the Palace  upon Le Gardeur--my brother wrote to that effect?\"    \"An important and honorable post in the Palace?\" The old soldier  emphasized the word HONORABLE. \"No, I had not heard of it,--never expect  to hear of an honorable post in the company of Bigot, Cadet, Varin, De  Pean, and the rest of the scoundrels of the Friponne! Pardon me, dear,  I do not class Le Gardeur among them, far from it, dear deluded boy! My  best hope is that Colonel Philibert will find him and bring him clean  and clear out of their clutches.\"    The question that had trembled on her lips came out now. For her life  she could not have retained it longer.    \"Who is Colonel Philibert, godfather?\" asked she, surprise, curiosity,  and a still deeper interest marking her voice, in spite of all she could  do to appear indifferent.    \"Colonel Philibert?\" repeated La Corne. \"Why, do not you know? Who but  our young Pierre Philibert; you have not forgotten him, surely, Amelie?  At any rate he has not forgotten you: in many a long night by our  watch-fires in the forest has Colonel Philibert passed the hours talking  of Tilly and the dear friends he left there. Your brother at any rate  will gratefully remember Philibert when he sees him.\"    Amelie blushed a little as she replied somewhat shyly, \"Yes, godfather,  I remember Pierre Philibert very well,--with gratitude I remember  him,--but I never heard him called Colonel Philibert before.\"    \"Oh, true! He has been so long absent. He left a simple ensign en second  and returns a colonel, and has the stuff in him to make a field-marshal!  He gained his rank where he won his glory--in Acadia. A noble fellow,  Amelie! loving as a woman to his friends, but to his foes stern as the  old Bourgeois, his father, who placed that tablet of the golden dog upon  the front of his house to spite the Cardinal, they say,--the act of a  bold man, let what will be the true interpretation of it.\"    \"I hear every one speak well of the Bourgeois Philibert,\" remarked  Amelie. \"Aunt de Tilly is ever enthusiastic in his commendation. She  says he is a true gentleman, although a trader.\"    \"Why, he is noble by birth, if that be needed, and has got the King's  license to trade in the Colony like some other gentlemen I wot of.  He was Count Philibert in Normandy, although he is plain Bourgeois  Philibert in Quebec; and a "]]]
