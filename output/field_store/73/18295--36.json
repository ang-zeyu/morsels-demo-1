Slowly, gradually, the woman  came. Soon he knew that she was the most beautiful thing that his art  had ever wrought. All that he had ever thought that a woman _should_  be, this woman was. Her form and features were all most perfect, and  so perfect were they, that he felt very sure that, had she been a  woman indeed, most perfect would have been the soul within. For her he  worked as he had never worked before. There came, at last, a day when  he felt that another touch would be insult to the exquisite thing he  had created. He laid his chisel aside and sat down to gaze at the  Perfect Woman. She seemed to gaze back at him. Her parted lips were  ready to speak--to smile. Her hands were held out to hold his hands.  Then Pygmalion covered his eyes. He, the hater of women, loved a  woman--a woman of chilly marble. The women he had scorned were  avenged.    [Illustration: THEN PYGMALION COVERED HIS EYES]    Day by day his passion for the woman of his own creation grew and  grew. His hands no longer wielded the chisel. They grew idle. He would  stand under the great pines and gaze across the sapphire-blue sea, and  dream strange dreams of a marble woman who walked across the waves  with arms outstretched, with smiling lips, and who became a woman of  warm flesh and blood when her bare feet touched the yellow sand, and  the bright sun of Cyprus touched her marble hair and turned it into  hair of living gold. Then he would hasten back to his studio to find  the miracle still unaccomplished, and would passionately kiss the  little cold hands, and lay beside the little cold feet the presents he  knew that young girls loved--bright shells and exquisite precious  stones, gorgeous-hued birds and fragrant flowers, shining amber, and  beads that sparkled and flashed with all the most lovely combinations  of colour that the mind of artist could devise. Yet more he did, for  he spent vast sums on priceless pearls and hung them in her ears and  upon her cold white breast; and the merchants wondered who could be  the one upon whom Pygmalion lavished the money from his treasury.    To his divinity he gave a name--\"Galatea\"; and always on still nights  the myriad silver stars would seem to breathe to him \"Galatea\" ... and  on those days when the tempests blew across the sandy wastes of Arabia  and churned up the fierce white surf on the rocks of Cyprus, the very  spirit of the storm seemed to moan through the crash of waves in  longing, hopeless and unutterable--\"Galatea!... Galatea!...\" For her  he decked a couch with Tyrian purple, and on the softest of pillows he  laid the beautiful head of the marble woman that he loved.    So the time wore on until the festival of Aphrodite drew near. Smoke  from many altars curled out to sea, the odour of incense mingled with  the fragrance of the great pine trees, and garlanded victims lowed and  bleated as they were led to the sacrifice. As the leader of his  people, Pygmalion faithfully and perfectly performed all his part in  the solemnities and at last he was left beside the altar to pray  alone. Never before had his words faltered as he laid his petitions  before the gods, but on this day he spoke not as a sculptor-king, but  as a child who was half afraid of what he asked.    \"O Aphrodite!\" he said, \"who can do all things, give me, I pray you,  one like my Galatea for my wife!\"    \"Give me my Galatea,\" he dared not say; but Aphrodite knew well the  words he would fain have uttered, and smiled to think how Pygmalion at  last was on his knees. In token that his prayer was answered, three  times she made the flames on the altar shoot up in a fiery point, and  Pygmalion went home, scarcely daring to hope, not allowing his  gladness to conquer his fear.    The shadows of evening were falling as he went into the room that he  had made sacred to Galatea. On the purple-covered couch she lay, and  as he entered it seemed as though she met his eyes with her own;  almost it seemed that she smiled at him in welcome. He quickly went up  to her and, kneeling by her side, he pressed his lips on those lips of  chilly marble. So many times he had done it before, and always it was  as though the icy lips that could never live sent their chill right  through his heart, but now it surely seemed to him that the lips were  cold no longer. He felt one of the little hands, and no more did it  remain heavy and cold and stiff in his touch, but lay in his own hand,  soft and living and warm. He softly laid his fingers on the marble  hair, and lo, it was the soft and wavy burnished golden hair of his  desire. Again, reverently as he had laid his offerings that day on  the altar of Venus, Pygmalion kissed her lips. And then did Galatea,  with warm and rosy cheeks, widely open her eyes, like pools in a dark  mountain stream on which the sun is shining, and gaze with timid  gladness into his own.    There are no after tales of Pygmalion and Galatea. We only know that  their lives were happy and that to them was born a son, Paphos, from  whom the city sacred to Aphrodite received its name. Perhaps Aphrodite  may have smiled sometimes to watch Pygmalion, once the scorner of  women, the adoring servant of the woman that his own hands had first  designed.          PHAETON        \"The road, to drive on which unskilled were Phaeton's hands.\"            Dante--_Purgatorio_.      To Apollo, the sun-god, and Clymene, a beautiful ocean-nymph, there  was born in the pleasant land of Greece a child to whom was given the  name of Phaeton, the Bright and Shining One. The rays of the sun  seemed to live in the curls of the fearless little lad, and when at  noon other children would seek the cool shade of the cypress groves,  Phaeton would hold his head aloft and gaze fearlessly up at the brazen  sky from whence fierce heat beat down upon his golden head.    \"Behold, my father drives his chariot across the heavens!\" he proudly  proclaimed. \"In a little while I, also, will drive the four snow-white  steeds.\"    His elders heard the childish boast with a smile, but when Epaphos,  half-brother to Apollo, had listened to it many times and beheld the  child, Phaeton, grow into an arrogant lad who held himself as though  he were indeed one of the Immortals, anger grew in his heart. One day  he turned upon Phaeton and spoke in fierce scorn:    \"Dost say thou art son of a god? A shameless boaster and a liar art  thou! Hast ever spoken to thy divine sire? Give us some proof of thy  sonship! No more child of the glorious Apollo art thou than are the  vermin his children, that the sun breeds in the dust at my feet.\"    For a moment, before the cruel taunt, the lad was stricken into  silence, and then, his pride aflame, his young voice shaking with rage  and with bitter shame, he cried aloud: \"Thou, Epaphos, art the liar. I  have but to ask my father, and thou shalt see me drive his golden  chariot across the sky.\"    To his mother he hastened, to get balm for his hurt pride, as many a  time he had got it for the little bodily wounds of childhood, and with  bursting heart he poured forth his story.    \"True it is,\" he said, \"that my father has never deigned to speak to  me. Yet I know, because thou hast told me so, that he is my sire. And  now my word is pledged. Apollo must let me drive his steeds, else I am  for evermore branded braggart and liar, and shamed amongst men.\"    Clymene listened with grief to his complaint. He was so young, so  gallant, so foolish.    \"Truly thou art the son of Apollo,\" she said, \"and oh, son of my  heart, thy beauty is his, and thy pride the pride of a son of the  gods. Yet only partly a god art thou, and though thy proud courage  would dare all things, it were mad folly to think of doing what a god  alone can do.\"    But at last she said to him, \"Naught that I can say is of any avail.  Go, seek thy father, and ask him what thou wilt.\" Then she told him  how he might find the place in the east where Apollo rested ere the  labours of the day began, and with eager gladness Phaeton set out upon  his journey. A long way he travelled, with never a stop, yet when the  glittering dome and jewelled turrets and minarets of the Palace of the  Sun came into view, he forgot his weariness and hastened up the steep  ascent to the home of his father.    Phoebus Apollo, clad in purple that glowed like the radiance of a  cloud in the sunset sky, sat upon his golden throne. The Day, the  Month, and the Year stood by him, and beside them were the Hours.  Spring was there, her head wreathed with flowers; Summer, crowned with  ripened grain; Autumn, with his feet empurpled by the juice of the  grapes; and Winter, with hair all white and stiff with hoar-frost. And  when Phaeton walked up the golden steps that led to his father's  throne, it seemed as though incarnate Youth had come to join the court  of the god of the Sun, and that Youth was so beautiful a thing that it  must surely live forever. Proudly did Apollo know him for his son, and  when the boy looked in his eyes with the arrogant fearlessness of  boyhood, the god greeted him kindly and asked him to tell him why he  came, and what was his petition.    As to Clymene, so also to Apollo, Phaeton told his tale, and his  father listened, half in pride and amusement, half in puzzled  vexation. When the boy stopped, and then breathlessly, with shining  eyes and flushed cheeks, ended up his story with: \"And, O light of the  boundless world, if I am indeed thy son, let it be as I have said, and  for one day only let me drive thy chariot across the heavens!\" Apollo  shook his head and answered very gravely:    \"In truth thou art my dear son,\" he said, \"and by the dreadful Styx,  the river of the dead, I swear that I will give thee any gift that  thou dost name and that will give proof that thy father is the  immortal Apollo. But never to thee nor to any other, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22694"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 2, January, 1851 (#4)"],[1,"blow,      Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye pines,      With every plant, in sign of worship wave!'    A second time he took up the sublime and melodious strain, and,  accompanying the action to the word, waved his own hand in token of  worship, and sank into the arms of his father--a corpse. Not a sensation  told him that in an instant he would stand in the presence of the  Creator to whom his body was bent in homage, and whose praises still  resounded from his lips.\"    The account which all the biographies of Burke give of the effect this  bereavement produced upon his parents is most fearful even to read; what  must it have been to witness? His mother seems to have regained her  self-possession sooner than his father. In one of his letters to the  late Baron Smith, he writes--\"So heavy a calamity has fallen upon me as  to disable me from business, and disqualifies me for repose. The  existence I have--_I do not know that I can call life_. * * Good nights  to you--I never have any.\" And again--\"The life which has been so  embittered cannot long endure. The grave will soon close over me, and my  dejections.\" To Lord Auckland he writes--\"For myself, or for my family  (alas! I have none), I have nothing to hope or to fear in this world.\"  And again in another letter--\"The storm has gone over me, and I lie like  one of those old oaks which the late hurricane has scattered about me. I  am stripped of all my honors, I lie prostrate on the earth; I am alone,  I have none to meet my enemies in the gate. I greatly deceive myself, if  in this hard season of life, I would give a peck of refuse wheat for all  that is called fame and honor in the world.\"    There is some thing in the \"wail\" and character of these laments that  recalls the mournful Psalms of David; like the Psalmist he endeavored to  be comforted, but it was by an effort. His political career was shrouded  for ever--the _motive_ to his great exertions was destroyed--but his  mind, wrecked as it had been, could not remain inactive. In 1795 his  _private_ reply to Mr. Smith's letter, requesting his opinion of the  expediency of and necessity for Catholic Emancipation, got into public  circulation; and in that singular document, though he did not enter into  the details of the question with as much minuteness as he would  previously have done, he pleaded for the removal of the whole of the  disabilities of the Roman Catholic body. From time to time he put forth  a small work on some popular question. He originated several plans for  benefiting the poor in his own neighborhood. He had a windmill in his  park for the purpose of supplying the poor with cheap bread, which bread  was served at his own table; and, as if clinging to the memory of the  youth of his son, he formed a plan for the establishment of an emigrant  school at Penn, where the children of those who had perished by the  guillotine or the sword amid the French convulsions, could be received,  supported, and educated. He made a generous appeal to government for the  benefit of these children, which was as generously responded to. The  house appropriated to this humane purpose had been inhabited by Burke's  old friend, General Haviland; and after his death several emigre French  priests sheltered within its walls. Until his last fatal illness Mr.  Burke watched over the establishment with the solicitude of a friend and  the tenderness of a father. The Lords of the Treasury allowed fifty  pounds per month for its sustenance: the Marquis of Buckingham made them  a present of a brass cannon and a stand of colors. When the Bourbons  were restored in 1814 they relieved the government from this charge, and  the institution was dissolved in 1820; in 1822 \"Tyler's Green House,\" as  it was called, was sold in lots, pulled down, and carried away; thus,  Burke's own dwelling being destroyed by fire, and this building,  sanctified by his sympathy and goodness, razed to the ground, little  remains to mark the locality of places where all the distinguished men  of the age congregated around \"the Burkes,\" and where Edmund, almost to  the last, extended hospitalities, coveted and appreciated by all who had  any pretensions to be considered as distinguished either by talent or  fortune.    It has frequently struck us as strange, the morbid avidity with which  the world seizes upon the slightest evidence of abstraction in great  men, to declare that their minds are fading, or impoverished: the public  gapes for every trifle calculated to prove that the palsied fingers can  no longer grasp the intellectual sceptre, and that the well-worn and  hard-earned bays are as a crown of thorns to the pulseless brow. It was,  in those days whispered in London that the great orator had become  imbecile immediately after the publication of his \"_Letter to a Noble  Lord_;\" and that he wandered about his park kissing his cows and horses.    A noble friend went immediately to Beaconsfield to ascertain the truth,  and was delighted to find Mr. Burke anxious to read him passages from \"A  Regicide Peace,\" which he was then writing; after a little delicate  manoeuvring on his part, to ascertain the truth, Mr. Burke told him a  touching incident which proved the origin of this calumny on his  intellectual powers.    An old horse, a great favorite of his son's, and his constant companion,  when both were full of life and health, had been turned out at the death  of his master, to take his run of the park for the remainder of his  life, at ease, with strict injunctions to the servants that he should  neither be ridden, nor molested by any one. While musing one day,  loitering along, Mr. Burke perceived this worn-out old servant come  close up to him, and at length, after some moments spent in viewing his  person, followed by seeming recollection and confidence, he deliberately  rested his head upon his bosom. The singularity of the action itself,  the remembrance of his dead son, its late master, who occupied so much  of his thoughts at all times, and the apparent attachment, tenderness  and intelligence of the creature towards him--as if it could sympathize  with his inward sorrow--rushing at once into his mind, totally  overpowered his firmness, and throwing his arms over its neck, he wept  long and loudly.    But though his lucid and beautiful mind, however agonized, remained  unclouded to the last, and his affections glowed towards his old friends  as warmly as ever, his bodily health was failing fast; one of the last  letters he ever dictated was to Mary Leadbeater, the daughter of his old  friend and master, Shackleton; this lady was subsequently well known in  Ireland as the author of \"Cottage Dialogues.\" The first literary  attempt, we believe, made towards the improvement of the lower order of  Irish, was by her faithful and earnest pen; to this letter,  congratulating her on the birth of a son, is a PS. where the invalid  says:--\"I have been at Bath these four months to no purpose, and am  therefore to be removed to my own house at Beaconsfield to-morrow, _to  be nearer to a habitation more permanent, humbly_ and fearfully hoping  that my better part may find a better mansion!\"    It would seem as if he anticipated the hour of his passing away. He sent  sweet messages of loving-kindness to all his friends, entreating and  exchanging pardons; recapitulated his motives of action on various  political emergencies; gave directions as to his funeral, and then  listened with attention to some serious papers of Addison on religious  subjects and on the immortality of the soul. His attendants after this  were in the act of removing him to his bed, when indistinctly invoking a  blessing on all around him, he sunk down and expired on the 9th of July,  1797, in the sixty-eighth year of his age.    \"His end,\" said his friend Doctor Lawrence, \"was suited to the simple  greatness of mind which he displayed through life; every way unaffected,  without levity, without ostentation, full of natural grace and dignity,  he appeared neither to wish nor to dread, but patiently and placidly to  await the appointed hour of his dissolution.\"    [Illustration: THE TOMB OF EDMUND BURKE.]    It was almost impossible to people, in fancy, the tattered and neglected  churchyard of Beaconsfield as it now is--with those who swelled the  funeral pomp of the greatest ornament of the British senate; to imagine  the titled pall-bearers, where the swine were tumbling over graves, and  rooting at headstones. Seldom, perhaps never, in England, had we seen a  churchyard so little cared for as that, where the tomb of Waller[6]  renders the surrounding disorder \"in a sacred place\" more conspicuous by  its lofty pretension, and where the church is regarded as the mausoleum  of Edmund Burke.[7] Surely the \"decency of churchyards\" ought to be  enforced, if those to whom they should be sacred trusts, neglect or  forget their duty. That the churchyard of Beaconsfield, which has long  been considered \"a shrine,\" should be suffered to remain in the state in  which we saw it, is a disgrace not only to the town, but to England; it  was differently cared for during Burke's lifetime, and though, like that  of the revered Queen Dowager, his Will expressed a disinclination to  posthumous honors, and unnecessary expense, never were mourners more  sincere--never did there arise to the blue vault of heaven the incense  of greater, and more deep-felt sorrow, than from the multitude who  assembled in and around the church, while the mortal remains of Edmund  Burke were placed in the same vault with his son and brother.    The tablet to his memory, placed on the wall of the south aisle of the  church, records his last resting-place with the relatives just named; as  well as the fact of the same grave containing the body of his \"entirely  beloved and incomparable wife,\" who died in 1812, at the age of 76.    Deeply do we deplore that the dwelling where he enjoyed so much"]]]
