With one hand pointing to the Great  Spirit, and with the other extended to the Red man he came. He asked for  a small seat. A seat the size of a buffalo skin would be quite large  enough for him, he said.    In the name of the Great Spirit, the Red Children greeted the White man,  and called him \"brother.\" They gave him the seat he asked. They gave him  a large buffalo skin also, and showed him where he could spread it by  their council fire.    The White man took the buffalo skin. He thanked his Red brother in the  name of the Great Spirit. Then he began to cut the skin into many, many  small strips.    [Illustration]    When the whole buffalo skin had been cut into narrow strips, he tied the  strips together. They made a long cord that would reach over a long  trail.    In amazement the Indians watched the White man while he measured off a  seat as long and as broad as this cord would reach around. The \"small  seat,\" the size of a buffalo skin, became a tract of land.    Soon the White man asked for another seat. This time his seat took in  the Indians' lodges and camp fire. He asked the Indians if they would  move on a few arrow flights. This they did.    Then the White man wanted another seat. Each time it took a larger skin  for him to sit upon. This time the skin stretched so far that it covered  a part of the Indians' hunting and fishing grounds.    Again the Indians moved on. Again the White man followed. Each time his  seat grew larger, until the Indian had a place but the size of a buffalo  skin on which to sit.    Thus it was that the White man came. Like a great White Bird that swept  from the Big Sea Water on the east to the Big Sea Water on the west, the  White man came; and he drove the Indian from the rising to the setting  sun.    [Illustration]          WHY THE EAGLE DEFENDS AMERICANS      Many, many moons before the White man came, a little Indian boy was left  in the woods. It was in the days when animals and men understood each  other better than they do now.    An old mother bear found the little Indian boy.    She felt very sorry for him. She told the little boy not to cry, for she  would take him home with her; she had a nice wigwam in the hollow of a  big tree.    Old Mother Bear had two cubs of her own, but she had a place between her  great paws for a third. She took the little papoose, and she hugged him  warm and close. She fed him as she did her own little cubs.    The boy grew strong. He was very happy with his adopted mother and  brothers. They had a warm lodge in the hollow of the great tree. As  they grew older, Mother Bear found for them all the honey and nuts that  they could eat.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    From sunrise to sunset, the little Indian boy played with his cub  brothers. He did not know that he was different from them. He thought he  was a little bear, too. All day long, the boy and the little bears  played and had a good time. They rolled, and tumbled, and wrestled in  the forest leaves. They chased one another up and down the bear tree.    Sometimes they had a matched game of hug, for every little bear must  learn to hug. The one who could hug the longest and the tightest won the  game.    Old Mother Bear watched her three dear children at their play. She would  have been content and happy, but for one thing. She was afraid some harm  would come to the boy. Never could she quite forget the bear hunters.  Several times they had scented her tree, but the wind had thrown them  off the trail.    Once, from her bear-tree window, she had thrown out rabbit hairs as she  saw them coming. The wind had blown the rabbit hairs toward the hunters.  As they fell near the hunters, they had suddenly changed into rabbits  and the hunters had given chase.    At another time, Mother Bear tossed some partridge feathers to the wind  as the hunters drew near her tree. A flock of partridges went whirring  into the woods with a great noise, and the hunters ran after them.    [Illustration]    But on this day, Mother Bear's heart was heavy. She knew that now the  big bear hunters were coming. No rabbits or partridges could lead these  hunters from the bear trail, for they had dogs with four eyes.  (Foxhounds have a yellow spot over each eye which makes them seem  double-eyed.) These dogs were never known to miss a bear tree. Sooner or  later they would scent it.    Mother Bear thought she might be able to save herself and her cubs. But  what would become of the boy? She loved him too well to let the bear  hunters kill him.    [Illustration]    Just then the porcupine, the Chief of the animals, passed by the bear  tree. Mother Bear saw him. She put her head out the bear-tree window and  called to him. He came and sat under the bear-tree window, and listened  to Mother Bear's story of her fears for the boy.    When she had finished, Chief Porcupine said he would call a council of  the animals, and see if they could not save the boy.    Now the Chief had a big voice. As soon as he raised his voice, even the  animals away on the longest trails heard. They ran at once and gathered  under the council tree. There was a loud roar, and a great flapping of  wings, for the birds came, too.    Chief Porcupine told them about the fears of Mother Bear, and of the  danger to the boy.    \"Now,\" said the Chief, \"which one of you will take the boy, and save him  from the bear hunters?\"    It happened that some animals were present that were jealous of man.  These animals had held more than one secret council, to plan how they  could do away with him. They said he was becoming too powerful. He knew  all they knew,--and more.    The beaver did not like man, because men could build better houses than  he.    The fox said that man had stolen his cunning, and could now outwit him.    The wolf and the panther objected to man, because he could conceal  himself and spring with greater surety than they.    [Illustration]    The raccoon said that man was more daring, and could climb higher than  he.    The deer complained that man could outrun him.    So when Chief Porcupine asked who would take the boy and care for him,  each of these animals in turn said that he would gladly do so.    Mother Bear sat by and listened as each offered to care for the boy. She  did not say anything, but she was thinking hard,--for a bear. At last  she spoke.    To the beaver she said, \"You cannot take the boy; you will drown him on  the way to your lodge.\"    To the fox she said, \"You cannot take him; you would teach him to cheat  and steal, while pretending to be a friend; neither can the wolf or the  panther have him, for they are counting on having something good to eat.    \"You, deer, lost your upper teeth for eating human flesh. And, too, you  have no home, you are a tramp.    \"And you, raccoon, I cannot trust, for you would coax him to climb so  high that he would fall and die.    \"No, none of you can have the boy.\"    Now a great bird that lives in the sky had flown into the council tree,  while the animals were speaking. But they had not seen him.    When Mother Bear had spoken, this wise old eagle flew down, and said,  \"Give the boy to me, Mother Bear. No bird is so swift and strong as the  eagle. I will protect him. On my great wings I will bear him far away  from the bear hunters.    \"I will take him to the wigwam of an Indian friend, where a little  Indian boy is wanted.\"    Mother Bear looked into the eagle's keen eyes. She saw that he could see  far.    Then she said, \"Take him, eagle, I trust him to you. I know you will  protect the boy.\"    The eagle spread wide his great wings. Mother Bear placed the boy on his  back, and away they soared, far from the council woods.    The eagle left the boy, as he had promised, at the door of a wigwam  where a little Indian boy was wanted.    This was the first young American to be saved by an American eagle.    The boy grew to be a noble chief and a great hunter. No hunter could hit  a bear trail so soon as he, for he knew just where and how to find the  bear trees. But never was he known to cut down a bear tree, or to kill a  bear.    However, many were the wolf, panther, and deerskins that hung in his  lodge. The hunter's wife sat and made warm coats from the fox and beaver  skins which the hunter father brought in from the chase. But never was  the hunter, his wife, or his children seen to wear a bear-skin coat.    [Illustration]          HOW THE TURKEY BUZZARD GOT HIS SUIT      [Illustration]    It was a long, long time ago, when the earth was very young. Trees and  flowers were growing everywhere, but there were no birds. One morning  the Great Spirit drew back the blanket from the door of his wigwam in  the sky. He looked upon the earth and smiled, for he saw that his work  was good.    \"Today,\" thought he, \"I will make big butterflies, to fly in and out  among the beautiful trees and flowers of the earth. They shall sing as  they fly.\"    Then the Great Spirit spoke, and the tree tops were full of birds,--but  they had no feathers.    All day he watched them fly and listened to their songs. But their naked  bodies and long legs did not please him. Before the sun had set he had  made feathered suits, of every size and color, to cover them.    That night, as the birds hid their heads under their wings, the Great  Spirit spoke to them. He told about the feathered suits he had made for  them, and where these suits could be found.    A council was called next day by the birds. They chose _Gah gah go wah_,  the Turkey Buzzard, to get the suits. He could fly over a long trail and  not be tired.    The birds told him that if he would go, he might have the first choice  of the suits of feathers, but he must try on no suit more than once.    Turkey Buzzard promised and set out toward the setting sun. Twice the  sun set, and three times it rose, before he found the feathered suits.  There were many of them, and they were very beautiful. He "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/221"],[0,"The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#4)"],[1,"was turned  towards us.    Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or  his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own.    \"Of course it has moved,\" said he. \"Am I such a farcical bungler,  Watson, that I should erect an obvious dummy and expect that some of  the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it? We have been in  this room two hours, and Mrs. Hudson has made some change in that figure  eight times, or once in every quarter of an hour. She works it from the  front so that her shadow may never be seen. Ah!\" He drew in his breath  with a shrill, excited intake. In the dim light I saw his head thrown  forward, his whole attitude rigid with attention. Outside, the street  was absolutely deserted. Those two men might still be crouching in the  doorway, but I could no longer see them. All was still and dark, save  only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure  outlined upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard that thin,  sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement. An instant  later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I  felt his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers which clutched me were  quivering. Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark  street still stretched lonely and motionless before us.    But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already  distinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the  direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very house in which  we lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An instant later steps  crept down the passage--steps which were meant to be silent, but which  reverberated harshly through the empty house. Holmes crouched back  against the wall and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle  of my revolver. Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a  man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. He stood for  an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the  room. He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had  braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea  of our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the window,  and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank to  the level of this opening the light of the street, no longer dimmed by  the dusty glass, fell full upon his face. The man seemed to be beside  himself with excitement. His two eyes shone like stars and his  features were working convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin,  projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache.  An opera-hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress  shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt  and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his hand he carried what  appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave  a metallic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky  object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud,  sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still  kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and  strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long,  whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He  straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was  a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He opened it at the  breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-block. Then, crouching  down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window,  and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as  it peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as  he cuddled the butt into his shoulder, and saw that amazing target, the  black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his fore  sight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger  tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a long,  silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant Holmes sprang like a  tiger on to the marksman's back and hurled him flat upon his face. He  was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes  by the throat; but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver  and he dropped again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as I held him  my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter of  running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one  plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the  room.    \"That you, Lestrade?\" said Holmes.    \"Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It's good to see you back in  London, sir.\"    \"I think you want a little unofficial help. Three undetected murders in  one year won't do, Lestrade. But you handled the Molesey Mystery with  less than your usual--that's to say, you handled it fairly well.\"    We had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a  stalwart constable on each side of him. Already a few loiterers had  begun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the window, closed  it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced two candles and the  policemen had uncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have a  good look at our prisoner.    It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned  towards us. With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a  sensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for  good or for evil. But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with  their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and  the threatening, deep-lined brow, without reading Nature's plainest  danger-signals. He took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed  upon Holmes's face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were  equally blended. \"You fiend!\" he kept on muttering. \"You clever, clever  fiend!\"    \"Ah, Colonel!\" said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar; \"'journeys end  in lovers' meetings,' as the old play says. I don't think I have had the  pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as I  lay on the ledge above the Reichenbach Fall.\"    The Colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance. \"You  cunning, cunning fiend!\" was all that he could say.    \"I have not introduced you yet,\" said Holmes. \"This, gentlemen, is  Colonel Sebastian Moran, once of Her Majesty's Indian Army, and the best  heavy game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced. I believe  I am correct, Colonel, in saying that your bag of tigers still remains  unrivalled?\"    The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion; with  his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like a tiger  himself.    \"I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a shikari,\"  said Holmes. \"It must be very familiar to you. Have you not tethered a  young kid under a tree, lain above it with your rifle, and waited for  the bait to bring up your tiger? This empty house is my tree and you  are my tiger. You have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there  should be several tigers, or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim  failing you. These,\" he pointed around, \"are my other guns. The parallel  is exact.\"    Colonel Moran sprang forward, with a snarl of rage, but the constables  dragged him back. The fury upon his face was terrible to look at.    \"I confess that you had one small surprise for me,\" said Holmes. \"I did  not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and  this convenient front window. I had imagined you as operating from the  street, where my friend Lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you.  With that exception all has gone as I expected.\"    Colonel Moran turned to the official detective.    \"You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,\" said he, \"but at  least there can be no reason why I should submit to the gibes of this  person. If I am in the hands of the law let things be done in a legal  way.\"    \"Well, that's reasonable enough,\" said Lestrade. \"Nothing further you  have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?\"    Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor and was  examining its mechanism.    \"An admirable and unique weapon,\" said he, \"noiseless and of tremendous  power. I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic, who constructed it  to the order of the late Professor Moriarty. For years I have been aware  of its existence, though I have never before had the opportunity of  handling it. I commend it very specially to your attention, Lestrade,  and also the bullets which fit it.\"    \"You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,\" said Lestrade, as the  whole party moved towards the door. \"Anything further to say?\"    \"Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?\"    \"What charge, sir? Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock  Holmes.\"    \"Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear in the matter at all. To  you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which  you have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you! With your usual  happy mixture of cunning and audacity you have got him.\"    \"Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"The man that the whole force has been seeking in vain--Colonel  Sebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding  bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the second-floor front  of No. 427, Park Lane, upon the 30th of last month. That's the charge,  Lestrade. And now, Watson, if you can endure the draught from a broken  window, I think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford  you some profitable amusement.\"      Our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision of  Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson.
