Jealousy, of course, at once suggests  itself as the motive for the crime.  And why should these proofs of the  deed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing?  Probably because during her  residence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events  which led to the tragedy.  You will observe that this line of boats  call at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that Browner  had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the  May Day, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his  terrible packet.    \"A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although I  thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it  before going further.  An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and  Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband.  There were many grave objections to this theory, but it was  conceivable.  I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend Algar, of  the Liverpool force, and asked him to find out if Mrs. Browner were at  home, and if Browner had departed in the May Day.  Then we went on to  Wallington to visit Miss Sarah.    \"I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had  been reproduced in her.  Then, of course, she might give us very  important information, but I was not sanguine that she would.  She must  have heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was  ringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the  packet was meant.  If she had been willing to help justice she would  probably have communicated with the police already.  However, it was  clearly our duty to see her, so we went.  We found that the news of the  arrival of the packet--for her illness dated from that time--had such  an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever.  It was clearer than  ever that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that  we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.    \"However, we were really independent of her help.  Our answers were  waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed Algar to  send them.  Nothing could be more conclusive.  Mrs. Browner's house had  been closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of  opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives.  It had been  ascertained at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the  May Day, and I calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow night.  When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and  I have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.\"    Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations.  Two days  later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from  the detective, and a typewritten document, which covered several pages  of foolscap.    \"Lestrade has got him all right,\" said Holmes, glancing up at me.  \"Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.    \"My dear Mr. Holmes:    In accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our  theories\" [\"the 'we' is rather fine, Watson, is it not?\"] \"I went down  to the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and boarded the S.S. May Day,  belonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company.  On inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the name of  James Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an  extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him  of his duties.  On descending to his berth, I found him seated upon a  chest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro.  He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy--something  like Aldrige, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.  He jumped up  when he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a  couple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to  have no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the  darbies.  We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well, for  we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp  knife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble.  However, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being  brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a  statement, which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our  shorthand man.  We had three copies typewritten, one of which I  enclose.  The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be an  extremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me in my  investigation.  With kind regards,    \"Yours very truly,    \"G. Lestrade.      \"Hum!  The investigation really was a very simple one,\" remarked  Holmes, \"but I don't think it struck him in that light when he first  called us in.  However, let us see what Jim Browner has to say for  himself.  This is his statement as made before Inspector Montgomery at  the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the advantage of being  verbatim.\"      \"'Have I anything to say?  Yes, I have a deal to say.  I have to make a  clean breast of it all.  You can hang me, or you can leave me alone.  I  don't care a plug which you do.  I tell you I've not shut an eye in  sleep since I did it, and I don't believe I ever will again until I get  past all waking.  Sometimes it's his face, but most generally it's  hers.  I'm never without one or the other before me.  He looks frowning  and black-like, but she has a kind o' surprise upon her face.  Ay, the  white lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face  that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before.    \"'But it was Sarah's fault, and may the curse of a broken man put a  blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins!  It's not that I  want to clear myself.  I know that I went back to drink, like the beast  that I was.  But she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as  close to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our  door.  For Sarah Cushing loved me--that's the root of the business--she  loved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that  I thought more of my wife's footmark in the mud than I did of her whole  body and soul.    \"'There were three sisters altogether.  The old one was just a good  woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah was  thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We were just as  happy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all  Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary.  And then we asked  Sarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led  to another, until she was just one of ourselves.    \"'I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money  by, and all was as bright as a new dollar.  My God, whoever would have  thought that it could have come to this?  Whoever would have dreamed it?    \"'I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if the  ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a time, and  in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah. She was a fine  tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a proud way of carrying  her head, and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint. But when  little Mary was there I had never a thought of her, and that I swear as  I hope for God's mercy.    \"'It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me, or  to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never thought anything of  that.  But one evening my eyes were opened. I had come up from the ship  and found my wife out, but Sarah at home.  \"Where's Mary?\" I asked.  \"Oh, she has gone to pay some accounts.\"  I was impatient and paced up  and down the room. \"Can't you be happy for five minutes without Mary,  Jim?\" says she.  \"It's a bad compliment to me that you can't be  contented with my society for so short a time.\"  \"That's all right, my  lass,\" said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she  had it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a  fever.  I looked into her eyes and I read it all there.  There was no  need for her to speak, nor for me either.  I frowned and drew my hand  away.  Then she stood by my side in silence for a bit, and then put up  her hand and patted me on the shoulder.  \"Steady old Jim!\" said she,  and with a kind o' mocking laugh, she ran out of the room.    \"'Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul,  and she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let her go on  biding with us--a besotted fool--but I never said a word to Mary, for I  knew it would grieve her.  Things went on much as before, but after a  time I began to find that there was a bit of a change in Mary herself.  She had always been so trusting and so innocent, but now she became  queer and suspicious, wanting to know where I had been and what I had  been doing, and whom my letters were from, and what I had in my  pockets, and a thousand such follies.  Day by day she grew queerer and  more irritable, and we had ceaseless rows about nothing.  I was fairly  puzzled by it all.  Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just  inseparable.  I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and  poisoning my wife's mind against me, but I was such a blind beetle that  I could not understand it at the time.  Then I broke my blue ribbon and  began to drink again, but I think I should not have done it if Mary had  been the same as ever. She had some reason to be disgusted with me now,  and the gap between us began to be wider and wider.  And then this Alec  Fairbairn chipped in, and things became a thousand times blacker.    \"'It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it was  to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made friends  wherever he went.  He was a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2345"],[0,"The Adventure of the Red Circle (#4)"],[1,"  come.\"    The beautiful Italian looked with awe at my companion.    \"I do not understand how you know these things,\" she said. \"Giuseppe  Gorgiano--how did he--\"  She paused, and then suddenly her face lit up  with pride and delight.  \"Now I see it!  My Gennaro!  My splendid,  beautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm, he did it,  with his own strong hand he killed the monster!  Oh, Gennaro, how  wonderful you are!  What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?\"    \"Well, Mrs. Lucca,\" said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon the  lady's sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill  hooligan, \"I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are; but  you've said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the  Yard.\"    \"One moment, Gregson,\" said Holmes.  \"I rather fancy that this lady may  be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it.  You  understand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the  death of the man who lies before us?  What you say may be used in  evidence.  But if you think that he has acted from motives which are  not criminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot  serve him better than by telling us the whole story.\"    \"Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,\" said the lady.  \"He was a  devil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would  punish my husband for having killed him.\"    \"In that case,\" said Holmes, \"my suggestion is that we lock this door,  leave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form  our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us.\"    Half an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room  of Signora Lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those  sinister events, the ending of which we had chanced to witness.  She  spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English, which, for  the sake of clearness, I will make grammatical.    \"I was born in Posilippo, near Naples,\" said she, \"and was the daughter  of Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of  that part.  Gennaro was in my father's employment, and I came to love  him, as any woman must.  He had neither money nor position--nothing but  his beauty and strength and energy--so my father forbade the match.  We  fled together, were married at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the  money which would take us to America.  This was four years ago, and we  have been in New York ever since.    \"Fortune was very good to us at first.  Gennaro was able to do a  service to an Italian gentleman--he saved him from some ruffians in the  place called the Bowery, and so made a powerful friend. His name was  Tito Castalotte, and he was the senior partner of the great firm of  Castalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit importers of New York.  Signor Zamba is an invalid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power  within the firm, which employs more than three hundred men.  He took my  husband into his employment, made him head of a department, and showed  his good-will towards him in every way.  Signor Castalotte was a  bachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and  both my husband and I loved him as if he were our father.  We had taken  and furnished a little house in Brooklyn, and our whole future seemed  assured when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our  sky.    \"One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a  fellow-countryman back with him.  His name was Gorgiano, and he had  come also from Posilippo.  He was a huge man, as you can testify, for  you have looked upon his corpse.  Not only was his body that of a giant  but everything about him was grotesque, gigantic, and terrifying.  His  voice was like thunder in our little house.  There was scarce room for  the whirl of his great arms as he talked.  His thoughts, his emotions,  his passions, all were exaggerated and monstrous.  He talked, or rather  roared, with such energy that others could but sit and listen, cowed  with the mighty stream of words.  His eyes blazed at you and held you  at his mercy.  He was a terrible and wonderful man.  I thank God that  he is dead!    \"He came again and again.  Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more  happy than I was in his presence.  My poor husband would sit pale and  listless, listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social  questions which made up our visitor's conversation.  Gennaro said  nothing, but I, who knew him so well, could read in his face some  emotion which I had never seen there before.  At first I thought that  it was dislike.  And then, gradually, I understood that it was more  than dislike.  It was fear--a deep, secret, shrinking fear.  That  night--the night that I read his terror--I put my arms round him and I  implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold  nothing from me, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so.    \"He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as I listened.  My poor  Gennaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against  him and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had  joined a Neapolitan society, the Red Circle, which was allied to the  old Carbonari.  The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were  frightful, but once within its rule no escape was possible.  When we  had fled to America Gennaro thought that he had cast it all off  forever. What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the  very man who had initiated him in Naples, the giant Gorgiano, a man who  had earned the name of 'Death' in the south of Italy, for he was red to  the elbow in murder!  He had come to New York to avoid the Italian  police, and he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in  his new home.  All this Gennaro told me and showed me a summons which  he had received that very day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it  telling him that a lodge would be held upon a certain date, and that  his presence at it was required and ordered.    \"That was bad enough, but worse was to come.  I had noticed for some  time that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the  evening, he spoke much to me; and even when his words were to my  husband those terrible, glaring, wild-beast eyes of his were always  turned upon me.  One night his secret came out.  I had awakened what he  called 'love' within him--the love of a brute--a savage.  Gennaro had  not yet returned when he came.  He pushed his way in, seized me in his  mighty arms, hugged me in his bear's embrace, covered me with kisses,  and implored me to come away with him.  I was struggling and screaming  when Gennaro entered and attacked him.  He struck Gennaro senseless and  fled from the house which he was never more to enter.  It was a deadly  enemy that we made that night.    \"A few days later came the meeting.  Gennaro returned from it with a  face which told me that something dreadful had occurred. It was worse  than we could have imagined possible.  The funds of the society were  raised by blackmailing rich Italians and threatening them with violence  should they refuse the money. It seems that Castalotte, our dear friend  and benefactor, had been approached.  He had refused to yield to  threats, and he had handed the notices to the police.  It was resolved  now that such an example should be made of them as would prevent any  other victim from rebelling. At the meeting it was arranged that he and  his house should be blown up with dynamite.  There was a drawing of  lots as to who should carry out the deed.  Gennaro saw our enemy's  cruel face smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. No doubt it  had been prearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with  the Red Circle upon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon his  palm.  He was to kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and  me to the vengeance of his comrades.  It was part of their fiendish  system to punish those whom they feared or hated by injuring not only  their own persons but those whom they loved, and it was the knowledge  of this which hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro's head and drove  him nearly crazy with apprehension.    \"All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each  strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us.  The very next  evening had been fixed for the attempt.  By midday my husband and I  were on our way to London, but not before he had given our benefactor  full warning of this danger, and had also left such information for the  police as would safeguard his life for the future.    \"The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves.  We were sure that our  enemies would be behind us like our own shadows.  Gorgiano had his  private reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew how ruthless,  cunning, and untiring he could be.  Both Italy and America are full of  stories of his dreadful powers.  If ever they were exerted it would be  now.  My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had  given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no  possible danger could reach me. For his own part, he wished to be free  that he might communicate both with the American and with the Italian  police.  I do not myself know where he lived, or how.  All that I  learned was through the columns of a newspaper.  But once as I looked  through my window, I saw two Italians watching the house, and I  understood that in some way Gorgiano had found our retreat. Finally  Gennaro told me, through the paper, that he would signal to me from a  certain window, but when the signals came they were nothing but  warnings, which were suddenly interrupted.  It is very clear to me now  that he knew Gorgiano to be close upon him, and that, thank God! he was  ready for him when he came.  And now, gentleman, I would ask you  whether we have anything to fear from "]]]
