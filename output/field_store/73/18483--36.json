By times, in thunder-notes,         The booming billows shoreward surge;       By times a silver laugh it floats;         By times a low, soft dirge.         Souls more ennobled grow         Listing the worldly anthem rise;       Discords are drowned in the great flow         Of Nature's harmonies.         Men change and 'cease to be,'         And empires rise and grow and fall;       But the weird music of the sea         Lives, and outlives them all.         The mystic song shall last         Till time itself no more shall be;       Till seas and shores have passed,         Lost in eternity.\"    But the wind is one of Nature's chief musicians. Sometimes singing his  own songs, or lending his aid in awaking to musical life the leaves  and boughs of the trees; whistling melodies among the reeds; entering  the recesses of a hollow column, and causing to issue from thence a  pleasing, flute-like sound; blowing his quiet, soothing lays in  zephyrs; or rushing around our dwellings, singing his tuneful yet  minor refrain,--in these, and in even other ways, does this mighty  element of the Creator contribute to the production of melody in the  world of nature. A writer in \"The Youth's Companion\" speaks very  entertainingly of \"voices in trees.\" He says,--         \"Trees, when played upon by the wind, yield forth a variety       of tones. Mrs. Hemans once asked Sir Walter Scott if he had       noticed that every tree gives out its peculiar sound. 'Yes,'       said he, 'I have; and I think something might be done by the       union of poetry and music to imitate those voices, giving a       different measure to the oak, the pine, the willow, &c.' The       same journal from which we take this anecdote mentions, that       in Henry Taylor's drama, 'Edwin the Fair,' there are some       pleasing lines, where the wind is feigned to feel the want       of a voice, and to woo the trees to give him one.         \"He applied to several: but the wanderer rested with the       pine, because her voice was constant, soft, and lowly deep;       and he welcomed in her a wild memorial of the ocean-cave,       his birthplace. There is a fine description of a storm in       'Coningsby,' where a sylvan language is made to swell the       diapason of the tempest. 'The wind howled, the branches of       the forest stirred, and sent forth sounds like an       incantation. Soon might be distinguished the various voices       of the mighty trees, as they expressed their terror or their       agony. The oak roared, the beech shrieked, the elm sent       forth its long, deep groan; while ever and anon, amid a       momentary pause, the passion of the ash was heard in moans       of thrilling anguish.'\"    I shall close this chapter on the music of Nature by appending a  beautiful reference to what has been called \"the music of the  spheres.\" The lines form, as well, an elegant and elevated description  of and tribute to music in general. I regret that the author's name  cannot be given.         \"The Father spake: in grand reverberations         Through space rolled on the mighty music-tide;       While to its low, majestic modulations         The clouds of chaos slowly swept aside.         The Father spake: a dream, that had been lying         Hushed from eternity in silence there,       Heard the pure melody, and, low replying,         Grew to that music in the wondering air,--         Grew to that music, slowly, grandly waking,         Till, bathed in beauty, it became a world;       Led by his voice, its spheric pathway taking,         While glorious clouds their wings around it furled.         Not yet has ceased that sound, his love revealing;         Though, in response, a universe moves by:       Throughout eternity its echo pealing,         World after world awakes in glad reply.         And wheresoever in his rich creation         Sweet music breathes,--in wave, in bird, or soul,--       'Tis but the faint and far reverberation         Of that great tune to which the planets roll.\"          III.    A GLANCE AT THE HISTORY OF MUSIC.         \"Thespis, the first professor of our art,       At country wakes sang ballads from a cart.\"         DRYDEN.      Music is as old as the world itself. In some form or other, it has  always existed. Ere man learned to give vent to his emotions in  tuneful voice, Nature, animate and inanimate, under the hand of the  Great Master, sang his praises. Of this we learn in the sacred  writings; while all about us, in the songs of birds, the musical  sighing of the winds, the fall of waters, and the many forms of the  music of Nature, we have palpable evidence of its present existence,  and assurances of its most remote antiquity.    It would seem that not long after \"God breathed into the nostrils of  man the breath of life, and he became a living soul,\" he learned to  express the joys and yearnings of his soul in song first, and then  with some sort of musical instrument. And to man it was given,  commencing with the early ages, to develop the simple ejaculations or  melodies of a praise-giving soul into a beautiful, a noble art,  replete at times with harmonic intricacies, and again with melodies  grand in their very simplicity; into a beneficent science, divine from  its inception, which has ever had as votaries many of earth's  greatest minds, and has become a fountain of delight to all mankind.    The history of the music of antiquity--that is, in an art-form--is  nearly, if indeed not quite, enveloped in mystery; and it were futile  to profess to give an historical presentation of an art from its  birth, when documentary evidence of the same is lost.    We may, however, very reasonably suppose of music generally, that it  must have been gradually developed, having had its infancy, childhood,  and youth; and that it grew slowly into present scientific form with  the advance of the centuries.    From all we can gather in regard to the early history of music as a  system, it would appear that it had its infancy in ancient Greece;  although it is supposed by some that the Grecian method was founded  upon that of the still more ancient one of the Egyptians. Dr. Burgh, a  learned musical writer states that, of \"the time before Christ, music  was most cultivated and was most progressive in Greece.\" The verses of  the Greek poet Homer, who was himself a musician, abound in beautiful  allusions to and descriptions of this charming science; while in  mythology are recounted the wonderful musical achievements of the god  Orpheus, who is said to have been so skilled in music that the very  rocks and trees followed in his wake of harmony.    The first artificial music of which the Bible speaks was that which  was sung or played in praise of the Creator,--sacred music. In fact,  this noble quality of the soul was very rarely called into exercise,  save in the worship of the Deity, until many centuries had passed. Of  music before the Christian era, both vocal and instrumental, the books  of the Old Testament often speak. As to its exact character, we are  left to conjecture, being, as before intimated, without materials from  which to form a judgment; but, in some form or other, there was,  during that period, abundance of what was called music.    The first mention of music, either vocal or instrumental, in the  Scriptures, is made in Gen. iv. 21: \"Jubal was the father of all such  as handle the harp and organ.\" Jubal was only seventh in descent from  Adam; and from this passage it is thought by some that he was the  inventor of instrumental music. In the year B.C. 1739, in Gen. xxxi.  27, Laban says to Jacob, \"Wherefore didst thou flee away from me, and  didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and  with songs, with tabret and with harp?\" This is the first mention in  the Bible of vocal music. King David, who has been called \"the sweet  singer of Israel,\" is said to have been a skilful performer on the  harp. By his magical touch upon its strings at a certain time, he  produced sounds so sweetly soothing as to drive away the \"evil spirit\"  from Saul.    The poet Byron pays an elevated, glowing tribute to this \"monarch  minstrel\" in the following lines:--         \"The harp the monarch minstrel swept,         The king of men, the loved of Heaven,       Which Music hallowed while she wept         O'er tones her heart of hearts had given,--         Redoubled be her tears; its chords are riven.         It softened men of iron mould;         It gave them virtues not their own:       No ear so dull, no soul so cold,         That felt not, fired not, to the tone;         Till David's lyre grew mightier than his throne.         It told the triumphs of our King;         It wafted glory to our God;       It made our gladdened valleys ring,         The cedars bow, the mountains nod:         Its sound aspired to heaven, and there abode.         Since then, though heard on earth no more,         Devotion, and her daughter Love,       Still bid the bursting spirit soar         To sounds that seem as from above,         In dreams that day's broad light cannot remove.\"    And here I append from the First of Chronicles, xiii. 8, a description  of the music of the \"house of Israel:\" \"And David and all Israel  played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with  harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and  with trumpets.\"    Josephus, the learned Jewish historian, states that the Egyptians had  two hundred thousand musicians playing at the dedication of the Temple  of Solomon. This structure was of most wonderfully immense dimensions:  and it may have been that this enormous body of performers played in  _detachments_ about the building; otherwise the statement would seem  apocryphal.    The Egyptian musical instruments, it appears, were mostly of very rude  construction: performance upon them would not now,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#4)"],[1,"at the peril of the pilgrimage that you neglect this stone,  whose virtue saved our fathers and the great battle.' ... 'The church  you will next see upon your way is entered from the southern porch  sunward by all truly devout men; such has been the custom here since  custom began.' From step to step the pilgrims were compelled to take the  oldest of paths.\" Well, some of the pilgrims, perhaps most of them,  since human nature imitates more often than it contradicts, may have  been so compelled. But not all. I should like to set next to Mr.  Belloc's passage a passage from the book of another pilgrim. Bunyan,  when he wrote _Pilgrim's Progress_, may not have referred directly to  the Way from Winchester to Canterbury, though his 'Vanity Fair' has been  guessed to correspond with Shalford Fair, and other details of the  progress have been fitted in with other happenings, as we shall see at  Shalford. But unquestionably he reproduces the state of mind with which  a pilgrim would undertake a journey, wherever his pilgrimage would take  him. He was born only ninety years after the last pilgrim had paid his  vows; he would have talked to men whose fathers had made the pilgrimage,  and as he writes of it the keynote is voluntary choosing of the road.  Here is the passage:--    \"I beheld, then, that they all went on till they came to the foot of the  hill Difficulty, at the bottom of which was a spring. There were also in  the same place two other ways, besides that which came straight from the  gate: one turned to the left hand, and the other to the right, at the  bottom of the hill; but the narrow way lay right up the hill; and the  name of that going up the side of the hill, is called Difficulty.  Christian now went to the spring and drank thereof to refresh himself,  and then began to go up the hill, saying--        'The hill, though high, I covet to ascend;      The difficulty will not me offend;      For I perceive the way to life lies here.      Come, pluck up heart, let's neither faint nor fear,      Better, though difficult, the right way to go,      Than wrong, though easy, where the end is woe.    The other two also came to the foot of the hill. But, when they saw that  the hill was steep and high, and that there were two other ways to go;  and supposing also that these two ways might meet again with that up  which Christian went, on the other side of the hill; therefore, they  were resolved to go in those ways. Now the name of one of those ways was  Danger, and the name of the other Destruction. So the one took the way  which is called Danger, which led him into a great wood; and the other,  took directly up the way to Destruction, which led him into a wide  field, full of dark mountains, where he stumbled and fell, and rose no  more.\"    Now that is exactly the way in which the pilgrims might have separated  and gone their own ways at a dozen places along the road to Canterbury.  Take, to begin with, the joining and the parting of the ways at Farnham.  Pilgrims would meet there, as we have seen, coming through Winchester,  from Normandy, or by the Harrow Way from Salisbury Plain, from Wales,  from Ireland, and all the West of England. But they would not all  necessarily leave by the road that runs straight from Farnham to the  foot of the Hog's Back. Some would have letters to the Abbot of  Waverley, would spend a night at the Abbey two miles to the south-east,  and join the others perhaps at Puttenham, six miles further along the  Way. Then, among those who chose to travel straight to the western slope  of the Hog's Back, there would be different minds at the foot of the  hill. Some would climb the hill at Whitewaysend--the white way of the  chalk would begin for them there--and would stride along in the sunlight  the seven straight miles to Guildford. Others would prefer to keep to a  path under the hill, stopping at the churches and gossiping at the inns.  You can trace the old road clearly through Seale to Puttenham, where it  must have travelled south of the church door, instead of taking the  awkward and unnecessary turn to the north which is taken by the modern  road. Then at Puttenham the pilgrims would divide again. Some would  journey straight on across Puttenham Heath, heading towards St.  Catherine's Hill--you can see the rough track; others would turn aside  to the south-east, to visit Compton church; perhaps they would come down  into Compton as you may come down into it from the east to-day, by what  is evidently an old track cut deep in the woods. They would go up north  again from Compton; perhaps they would be tired of the valley, and would  climb the Hog's Back to walk the last mile or so into Guildford in the  wind; perhaps they would join the other stream of pilgrims travelling by  the sandy lane by which you may walk to-day as slowly as they did  towards St. Catherine's Hill. Most of them, I think, would collect on  St. Catherine's Hill; St. Catherine's was more popular than the  Guildford churches. So General James has discovered, examining ancient  records of litigation. The parson of St. Nicholas, Guildford, fearing to  lose his profit from the pilgrims who visited the town, purchased from  the lord of the manor the freehold of the site of the chapel, and  rebuilt it in 1317. Perhaps the attraction of St. Catherine's was that  it was on the way to Shalford Fair. Guildford had two special fairs, on  May 4 and November 22, to catch the summer and the winter pilgrims. But  Shalford Fair was the great fair, and actually covered 140 acres of  ground.    [Illustration: _Coming in to Puttenham._]    The pilgrims would cross the Wey under St. Catherine's Hill by a ferry  or a rough plank bridge. The merchants travelling with their horses, and  the ponies driven from Weyhill Fair out towards Salisbury Plain, would  come through the water by a ford. But the ferry and the bridge were both  of almost immemorial antiquity. In 1736 there was a dispute about the  bridge. The lord of the manor of Braboeuf had built a bridge over the  Wey for a fair on St. Matthew's Day. The owner of the church lands at  Shalford ordered it to be destroyed; he claimed the right of conveying  passengers over the river. They went to law, and it was alleged that  there had been a bridge there time out of record. Judgment, however,  decided \"that there had been no bridge except _per unum battellum_ (one  plank) at the mill belonging to the heirs of Henry de la Poyle (a mile  lower), laid for convenience of the pilgrims going to the chapel of St.  Katherine at the time of the fair.\" General James has unearthed the  decision of the Court, and incidentally added another bypath to the  Pilgrims' Way.    Opposite the ferry under St. Catherine's the line of the Way to St.  Martha's is clear enough, a green track in a green field; and once I saw  it as the pilgrims may have seen it on a spring morning. It was in May,  and there was a haze over the meadowland by the river which blurred  shapes and colours. St. Catherine's was no longer a ruin; the buildings  on the hill faded into the trees; the clothes of wanderers by the  riverside took on mediaeval brightnesses, lost modern forms; and into the  foreground ran three bare-headed, yellow-haired children, and in their  brown arms great bunches of cuckoo-flowers. So might one returning from  the Martyr's chapel have seen the path to the ferry in the days when the  Clerk told the tale of Griselda.    The track crosses the road near the ferry, and by a wood named the  Chantries comes up to St. Martha's, at the foot of the hill a  close-cropped aisle of down grass, and nearer the top a loose, sandy  path among pines. At the base of the hill the pilgrims who had come by  the ferry would be joined by those who had left Guildford by Pewley  Hill, to come out through the valley past Tytings, now a private  residence, but once the dwelling of St. Martha's priest. And on the  other side of the hill a difficulty waits. Mr. Belloc traces the road  from the foot across a ploughed field, to connect with a narrow lane on  the other side of the road dropping from Newlands Corner to Albury.  Well, it is possible that some of the pilgrims strayed out in that  direction, though it means that they would have to descend a bank like  the wall of a house by the Newlands Corner road, which is a sunken  track; also, Mr. Belloc owns that a little further on this road he  chooses has a doubtful section of a mile and a half. May he not be on  the wrong road? Why should not the pilgrims drop down the road which  leads from the foot of St. Martha's Hill into Albury? The inns would  have tempted them; they would be heading straight for the church; and  the road leading to inns and church is clearly a road that led from St.  Martha's Hill into the valley of the Tillingbourne long before the hill  bore a Christian chapel. It is evidently an old British trackway. It  runs along a ridge, and yet it is sunk deep between two very high banks.  If it was there when the pilgrims came down from the Martyr's chapel,  why should they make a fresh track for themselves, especially one which,  as Mr. Belloc admits, \"raises a difficulty unique in the whole course of  the way\"? The track he follows goes by the wet, northward side of a  hill--\"an exception to an otherwise universal rule.\"    I have no space to follow the way in detail through the country, but  this particular section seemed to me to illustrate clearly the need for  imagining what the pilgrims would be likely to do, rather than to try to  fit in their doings with a particular path or lane through Albury. I do  not see why the pilgrims should not have followed the same route as we  travel by to-day. Doubtless by what is now Albury Park the road has  become confused. May it not have led through Albury Park past the south  porch of the ruined church, and so come in a natural way to Shere church  by the old inn? All five would then lie in a line--the old"]]]
