Mix, taking care that the eggs do not harden.      34    FRIED CHICKEN    (Pollo fritto)    Wash a spring chicken and keep in boiling water for one minute. Cut into  pieces at the joints, roll them in flour, season with salt and pepper  and dip in two whole beaten eggs. After leaving the pieces of chicken  for half an hour, roll them in bread crumbs, repeating the operation  twice if necessary. Put into a saucepan with boiling oil or fat, seeing  that the pieces of chicken are well browned on both sides. Keep the fire  low. Serve hot with lemon.      35    CHICKEN ALLA CACCIATORA    (Pollo alla cacciatora)    Chop one large onion and keep it for more than half an hour in cold  water, then dry it and brown it aside. Cut up a chicken, sprinkle the  pieces with flour, salt and pepper and saute, in the fat which remains  in the frying pan. When the chicken is brown add one pint fresh or  canned tomatoes and half a dozen sweet green peppers and put back the  onion. When the gravy is thick enough add hot water to prevent the  burning of the vegetables. Cover the pan tightly and simmer until the  chicken is very tender. This is an excellent way to cook tough chickens.  Fowls which have been boiled may be cooked in this way, but of course  young and tender chickens will have the finer flavor.      36    CORN MEAL WITH SAUSAGES    (Polenta con salsicce)    Cook in water one cup of yellow cornmeal making a stiff mush. Salt it  well and when it is cooked spread out to cool on a bread board about  half an inch thick. Then cut the mush into small squares.    Put in a saucepan several whole sausages with a little water, and when  they are cooked skin and crush them and add some brown stock or tomato  sauce.    Put the polenta (or cornmeal mush) in a fireproof receptacle, season  with grated cheese, the crushed sausages and a piece of butter. Put it  in the oven and serve when hot.      37    POLENTA PIE    (Polenta Pasticciata)    Make a very stiff mush of cornmeal cooked in milk. Salt it well and  spread out on the bread board in a sheet about one inch thick. When  cold, cut in little diamonds or squares and place these in a buttered  baking dish. Prepare the =Bolognese sauce= according to the following  recipe: Chop 1/4 lb. round steak, a slice of pork or bacon, one small  carrot 1/4 onion, one large piece celery. Put the meat and vegetables  over the fire with a piece of butter. When the meat has browned add half  a tablespoon of flour and wet the mixture with hot water or broth,  allowing it to simmer from half an hour to an hour. It is done when it  is the consistency of a thick gravy.    Make a smooth white sauce with milk cornstarch and butter. Over a layer  of the polenta, cut as above and placed in the baking dish sprinkle  some grated cheese and a few tablespoons each of the white sauce and the  meat sauce. Repeat until the dish is full. Bake until the top is nicely  browned. This dish seems very elaborate, but it is very delicious and a  meal in itself.    The Bolognese sauce is also used to season macaroni or spaghetti in lieu  of the tomato sauce or the brown stock.      38    STUFFED ROLLS    (Pagnottelle ripiene)    Take some rolls, and by means of a round opening on the top, as large as  a half dollar piece or less, extract nearly all the crumb, leaving the  crust intact, but not too thin. Wet inside and outside with hot milk,  and when they are fairly soaked, dip in beaten eggs and fry them in lard  or oil. When beginning to brown, fill them with meat that has been  previously chopped and cooked. This chopped meat ought to be made with  breast of chicken, chicken giblets, liver etc., brown stock and some  flour to hold it together.      39    STEWED VEAL    (Stracotto di vitella)    The stock from this dish may very well be used to season macaroni or  boiled rice. Care must be taken, however, not to draw away all the  juice of the meat in order to have a sauce too rich at the expense of  the principal dish.    Place in a saucepan one pound of veal or more, bone included, a piece of  butter or some olive oil (or the two together) half a medium sized  onion, one small carrot, two celery stalks cut in small pieces. Season  with salt and pepper. Put it on a low fire, turn the meat over often and  when browned add a pinch of flour and some tomato paste, bringing it to  full cooking with water poured little by little. The flour is used to  keep the sauce together and give it color, but care must be taken not to  burn it, because in that case the sauce would have an unpleasant taste  and a black, instead of a reddish color. The addition of dried  mushrooms, previously softened in the water and slightly boiled in the  sauce will add greatly to its taste.    As has been said the sauce can well be used to season spaghetti or  risotto. The stewed veal can be served with some vegetable.      40    CHICKEN BONED AND STUFFED    (Pollo dissossato ripieno)    To remove the bones from a chicken the following instructions will be  found useful.    Wash and singe the fowl: take off the head and legs, and remove the  tendons. When a fowl is to be boned it is not drawn. The work of boning  is not difficult, but it requires practice. The skin must not be broken.  Use a small pointed knife cut the skin down the full length of the back;  then, beginning at the neck, carefully scrape the meat away from the  bone, keeping the knife close to the bone. When the joints of the wings  and legs are met, break them back and proceed to free the meat from the  carcass. When one side is free, turn the fowl and do the same on the  other side. The skin is drawn tightly over the breast-bone, and care  must be used to detach it without piercing the skin. When the meat is  free from the carcass, remove the bones from the legs and wings, turning  the meat down or inside out, as the bones are exposed, and using care  not to break the skin at the joints. The end bones of the wing cannot be  removed, and the whole end joint may be cut off or left as it is.    Now that the fowl is boned make the following stuffing, regulating the  quantity on the size of the chicken. Chop half a pound or more, of lean  veal, and grind it afterwards, so that it may make a paste. Add a large  piece of bread crumb soaked in broth, a tablespoon of grated cheese,  three yolks of egg, salt, pepper and, if desired, just a taste of  nutmeg. Finally mix also one or two slices of ham and tongue, cut in  small pieces. Stuff the boned chicken with this filling, sew up the  opening, wrap it tightly in a cloth and put to cook in water on a low  fire. When taken from the water, remove the wrapping and brown it, first  with butter, then in a sauce made in the following way: Break all the  bones that have been extracted from the chicken, the head and neck  included, and put them on the fire with dried meat cut in little pieces,  butter, onion, celery and carrot, seasoned with salt and pepper. Make  the sauce with the water in which the chicken has been boiled, which has  naturally become a good chicken broth.    Before sending to the table, remove the thread with which the chicken  has been sewed.      41    CHICKEN WITH TOMATOES    (Pollo alla contadina)    Take a young chicken and make some little holes in the skin in which you  will put some sprigs of rosemary and a clove of garlic cut into five or  six pieces. Put it on the fire with chopped lard and season with salt  and pepper inside and outside. When it is well browned on all parts add  tomatoes cut in pieces, taking care to remove previously all the seeds.  Moisten with broth or water. Brown some potatoes in oil, fat or butter,  previously cutting them into sections. When browned dip in the sauce of  the chicken and serve the whole together.      42    CHICKEN WITH SHERRY    (Pollo al marsala)    Cut the chicken in big pieces and put it in the saucepan with one medium  sized onion chopped fine and a piece of butter. Season with salt and  pepper and, when it is well browned, add some broth and complete the  cooking. Remove the excessive fat from the sauce by sifting through a  sieve or otherwise, and put the chicken back on the fire with a glass of  Sherry or Marsala wine, removing it from the fire as soon as the sauce  begins to boil.      43    CHICKEN WITH SAUSAGES    (Pollo colle salsicce)    Chop fine half an onion and put it in a saucepan with a piece of butter  and four or five slices of ham, half an inch wide. Over these  ingredients place a whole chicken, season with pepper and a little salt  and place on the fire. Brown it on all sides and, when the onion is all  melted, add water or broth and three or four sausages freshly made. Let  it cook on a low fire, seeing that the sauce remains liquid and does not  dry up.      44    CHICKEN WITH EGG SAUCE    (Pollo in salsa d'uova)    Break into pieces a young chicken and put it in the saucepan with a  piece of butter. Season with salt and pepper. When it is half browned  sprinkle with a pinch of flour to give it color, then complete the  cooking with broth. Remove it from the same and put it on a plate. Beat  the yolk of one egg with the piece of half a lemon and pour it on the  sauce of the chicken, allowing it to simmer for some minutes. Then pour  on the chicken and serve hot.      45    CHICKEN BREASTS SAUTES    (Petti di pollo alla saute)    Cut the breast of a fowl in very thin slices, give them the best  possible shape and make a whole piece from the little pieces that will  remain, cleaning well the breast-bone, crushing and mixing these. Season  with salt and pepper and dip the slices in beaten eggs, leaving them for  a few hours. Sprinkle with bread crumbs ground fine and saute in butter.  Serve with lemon.    If you want this dish more elaborate prepare a sauce in the following  way: Put some good olive oil in a frying pan, just enough to cover the  bottom, and cover the oil with a layer of dry mushrooms. Sprinkle over  a small quantity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#4)"],[1,"of pollen mixed with  honey, and in this deposits from seven to fourteen eggs, gradually  adding to the pollen mass until the first brood is hatched. She does not  wait, however, for one brood to be hatched before laying the eggs of  another, but, as soon as food enough has been collected, she lays the  eggs for a second. The eggs are laid, in contact with each other, in one  cavity of the mass of pollen, with a part of which they are slightly  covered. They are very soon developed; in fact, the lines are nowhere  distinctly drawn between the egg and the larva, the larva and pupa, and  again between the latter and the imago; a perfect series, showing this  gradual transformation of the young to the imago can be found in almost  every nest.    [Illustration: 15. Cell and Eggs of Bombus.]    \"As soon as the larvae are capable of motion and commence feeding, they  eat the pollen by which they are surrounded, and, gradually separating,  push their way in various directions. Eating as they move, and  increasing in size quite rapidly, they soon make large cavities in the  pollen mass. When they have attained their full size, they spin a silken  wall about them, which is strengthened by the old bees covering it with  a thin layer of wax, which soon becomes hard and tough, thus forming a  cell (Fig. 15, 1, cell containing a larva, on top of which (2) is a  pollen mass containing three eggs). The larvae now gradually attain the  pupa stage, and remain inactive until their full development. They then  cut their way out, and are ready to assume their duties as workers,  small females, males or queens.    \"It is apparent that the irregular disposition of the cells is due to  their being constructed so peculiarly by the larvae. After the first  brood, composed of workers, has come forth, the queen bee devotes her  time principally to her duties at home, the workers supplying the colony  with honey and pollen. As the queen continues prolific, more workers are  added, and the nest is rapidly enlarged.    \"About the middle of summer, eggs are deposited, which produce both  small females and males.\" ... \"All eggs laid after the last of July  produce the large females, or queens, and, the males being still in the  nest, it is presumed that the queens are impregnated at this time, as on  the approach of cold weather all except the queens, of which there are  several in each nest, die.\"    While the Humble bee in some respects shows much less instinct than the  solitary bees mentioned below, it stands higher in the series, however,  from having workers, as well as males and females, who provide food for  the young. The labors of the Mason bees, and their allies, terminate  after the cell is once constructed and filled with pollen. The eggs are  then left to hatch, and the young care for themselves, though the adult  bee shows greater skill in architecture than the Humble bee. It is thus  throughout nature. Many forms, comparatively low in the scale of life,  astonish us with certain characters or traits, reminding us of beings  much superior, physically and intellectually. The lower forms constantly  reach up and in some way ally themselves with creatures far more highly  organized. Thus the fish-like seal reminds us strikingly of the dog,  both in the form of the head, in its docility and great intelligence  when tamed, and even in its bark and the movements of the head.    [Illustration: 16. Meloe.]    The parasites of the Humble bee are numerous. Such are the species of  Apathus, which so closely resembles the Humble bee itself, that it  requires long study to distinguish it readily. Its habits are not known,  other than that it is found in the nests of its host. It differs from  the Humble bee in having no pollen-basket, showing that its larvae must  feed on the food stored up by their host, as it does not itself collect  it. The mandibles also are not, like those of Bombus, trowel-shaped for  architectural purposes, but acutely triangular, and are probably not  used in building.    The caterpillars of various moths consume the honey and waxen cells; the  two-winged flies, Volucella and Conops, and the larvae of what is either  an Anthomyia or Tachina-like fly, and several species of another genus  of flies, Anthrax, together with several beetles, such as the Meloe  (Fig. 16), Stylops (Fig. 17, male; 18_b_, female; _a_, position in the  body of its host), and Antherophagus prey upon them.    [Illustration: 17. Male Stylops.]    The power of boring the most symmetrical tunnels in solid wood reaches  its perfection in the large Virginian Carpenter bee (Xylocopa Virginica,  Fig. 19). This bee is as large as, and some allied exotic species are  often considerably larger than, the Humble bee, but not clothed with  such dense hairs. We have received from Mr. James Angus, of West Farms,  N. Y., a piece of trellis from a grape vine, made of pine wood,  containing the cells and young in various stages of growth, together  with the larvae and chrysalids of Anthrax sinuosa (Fig. 20), a species of  fly parasitic on the larva. The maggot buries its head in the soft body  of the young bee and feeds on its juices.    Mr. Angus thus writes us regarding its habits, under date of July 19: \"I  asked an intelligent and observing carpenter yesterday, if he knew how  long it took the Xylocopa to bore her tunnel. He said he thought she  bored about one-quarter of an inch a day. I don't think myself she  bores more than one-half inch, if she does that. If I mistake not, it  takes her about two days to make her own length at the first start; but  this being across the grain of the wood, may not be so easily done as  the remainder, which runs parallel with it. She always follows the grain  of the wood, with the exception of the entrance, which is about her own  length. The tunnels run from one to one and a half feet in length. They  generally run in opposite directions from the opening, and sometimes  other galleries are run, one directly above the other, using the same  opening. I think they only make new tunnels when old ones are not to be  found, and that the same tunnels are used for many years. Some of the  old tunnels are very wide. I have found parts of them about an inch in  diameter. I think this is caused by rasping off the sides to procure the  necessary material for constructing their cells. The partitions are  composed of wood raspings, and some sticky fluid, probably saliva, to  make them adhere.    [Illustration: 18. Female Stylops.]    [Illustration: 19. Carpenter Bee.]    \"The tunnels are sometimes taken possession of by other bees and wasps.  I think when this is the case, the Xylocopa prefers making a new cell,  to cleaning out the dirt and rubbish of the other species. I frequently  find these bees remaining for a long time on the wing close to the  opening, and bobbing their heads against the side, as if fanning air  into the opening. I have seen them thus employed for twenty minutes.  Whether one bee or more makes the tunnel, that is, whether they take  turns in boring, I cannot at present say. In opening the cells (Fig.  21), more than one are generally found, even at this season. About two  weeks ago; I found as many as seven, I think, in one.\"[3]    The hole is divided by partitions into cells about seven-tenths of an  inch long. These partitions are constructed of the coarse dust or  chippings made by the bee in eating out her cells, for our active little  carpenter is provided with strong cutting jaws, moved by powerful  muscles, and on her legs are stiff brushes of hair for cleaning out the  tunnel as she descends into the heart of the solid wood. She must throw  out the chips she bites off with her powerful mandibles from the sides  of the burrow, by means of her hind legs, passing the load of chips  backwards out of the cell with her fore limbs, which she uses as hands.    [Illustration: 20. Larva and Pupa of Anthrax.]    The partitions are built most elaborately of a single flattened band of  chips, which is rolled up into a coil four layers deep. One side,  forming the bottom of the cell, is concave, being beaten down and  smoothed off by the bee. The other side of the partition, forming the  top of the cell, is flat and rough.    [Illustration: 21. Nest of Carpenter Bee.]    At the time of opening the burrow, July 8th, the cells contained nearly  full-grown larvae, with some half developed. They were feeding on the  masses of pollen, which were as large as a thick kidney bean, and  occupied nearly half the cell. The larvae (Fig. 21) resemble those of the  Humble bee, but are slenderer, tapering more rapidly towards each end of  the body.    The habits and structure of the little green Ceratina ally it closely  with Xylocopa. This pretty bee, named Ceratina dupla by Mr. Say, tunnels  out the stems of the elder or blackberry, syringa, or any pithy shrub,  excavating them often to a depth of six or seven inches. She makes the  walls just wide enough to admit her body, and of a depth capable of  holding three or four, often five or six cells (Fig. 22). The finely  built cells, with their delicate silken walls, are cylindrical and  nearly square at each end, though the free end of the last cell is  rounded off. They are four and a half tenths of an inch long, and a  little over one-third as broad. The bee places them at nearly equal  distances apart, the slight interval between them being filled in with  dirt.    [Illustration: 22. Nest of Ceratina.]    Dr. T. W. Harris states that May 15, 1832, one female laid its eggs in  the hollow of an aster stalk. Three perfect insects were disclosed from  it July 28th. The observations of Mr. Angus, who saw some bees making  their cells May 18th, also confirm this account. The history of our  little upholsterer is thus cleared up. Late in the spring she builds her  cells, fills them with pollen, and lays one or more eggs upon each mass.  Thus in about two months the insect"]]]
