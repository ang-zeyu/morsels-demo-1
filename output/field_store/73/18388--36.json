When the first moments and days of overwhelming grief are over  these reflections are the greatest balm, the greatest consolation to  the bleeding heart.    I hope you will kindly let me have a few lines of _hope_ by the  Tuesday's messenger. Ever your truly devoted Niece and Child,    VICTORIA R.    _P.S._--O'Connell's being pronounced guilty is a great triumph.[8]        [Footnote 8: He had been indicted with Charles Gavan Duffy and      others for seditious conspiracy.]          _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._    SOUTH STREET, _3rd April 1844._    Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, with many  thanks for your Majesty's note of the 28th ult. Lord Melbourne  believes that your Majesty is quite right in saying that Lord  Melbourne has still some health left, if he will but take care of  it. Lord Melbourne told Dr Holland, without mentioning your Majesty's  name, that this had been said to him by a friend, and Dr Holland  immediately said that it was very just and true, and very well  expressed, and quite what he should have said himself. At the same  time, the change from strength to weakness and the evident progress  of decadence is a very hard and disagreeable trial. Lord Melbourne has  been reading Cicero on old age, a very pretty treatise, but he does  not find much consolation after it; the principal practical resources  and alleviations which he recommends are agriculture and gardening, to  both of which, but more particularly to the latter, Lord Melbourne has  already had recourse. It is certainly, as your Majesty says, wrong to  be impatient and to repine at everything, but still it is difficult  not to be so. Lady Uxbridge's death[9] is a shocking event, a  dreadful loss to him and to all. Lord Melbourne always liked her. Lord  Melbourne is going down to Brocket Hall to-morrow, and will try to get  Uxbridge and the girls to come over and dine.    Lord Melbourne has felt very much for the grief which your Majesty  must feel at a separation, even short and temporary, from the Prince,  and it is extremely amiable to feel comforted by the recollection  of the extreme pleasure which his visit will give to his and your  Majesty's relations. It is, of course, impossible that your Majesty  should in travelling divest yourself of your character and dignity.    Lord Melbourne has just driven round the Regent's Park, where there  are many almond trees in bloom, and looking beautiful.        [Footnote 9: Henrietta Maria, daughter of Sir Charles Bagot,      G.C.B.]          [Pageheading: RECALL OF LORD ELLENBOROUGH]      _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    WHITEHALL, _23rd April 1844._    Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs leave to  acquaint your Majesty that he has every reason to believe that the  Court of Directors will _to-morrow_, by an unanimous vote, resolve on  the actual recall of Lord Ellenborough.[10]        [Footnote 10: This anomalous privilege was exercised by the      Directors in consequence chiefly of what they considered Lord      Ellenborough's overbearing demeanour in communication with      them, his too aggressive policy, and his theatrical love of      display.]          _Queen Victoria to Sir Robert Peel._    Buckingham Palace, _23rd April 1844._    The Queen has heard with the greatest regret from Sir R. Peel that the  Court of Directors, after all, mean to recall Lord Ellenborough. She  cannot but consider this _very_ unwise at this critical moment, and a  very ungrateful return for the eminent services Lord Ellenborough has  rendered to the Company in India. They ought not to forget so soon in  what state Lord Ellenborough found affairs in 1842. The Queen would  not be sorry if these gentlemen knew that this is her opinion.          _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._    Laeken, _3rd May 1844._    MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--Whenever you wish to make me _truly happy_, you  will have the power of doing so by repeating expressions as kind and  affectionate as those contained in your dear little letter of the  30th. I have ever had the care and affection of a _real father_ for  you, and it has perhaps even been freer from many drawbacks which  occasionally will exist betwixt parents and children, be they ever  so well and affectionately together. With me, even from the moment in  January 1820, when I was called by a messenger to Sidmouth, my care  for you has been unremitting, and never has there been a cloud between  us.... A thing which often strikes me, in a very satisfactory manner,  is that we never had any bitter words, a thing which happens even with  people who are very lovingly together; and the little row which we  had in 1838 you remember well, and do not now think that _I_  was wrong.[11] _De pareilles relations sont rares; may they ever  continue!_    I cannot leave this more serious topic without adding that though you  were always warm-hearted and right-minded, it must strike yourself how  matured every kind and good feeling is in your generous heart. _The  heart, and not the head, is the safest guide in positions like yours_,  and this not only for this earthly and very short life, but for that  which we must hope for hereafter. When a life draws nearer its close,  how many earthly concerns are there that appear _still in the same  light_? and how clearly the mind is struck that nothing has been and  is still of _real_ value, than the nobler and better feelings of the  heart; the only good we can hope to keep as a precious store for the  future. What do we keep of youth, beauty, richness, power, and even  the greatest extent of earthly possessions? NOTHING! ... Your truly  devoted Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.        [Footnote 11: _See_ Letters of Queen Victoria and the King of      the Belgians, _ante_, vol. i. pp. 116-120.]        [Pageheading: HONOURS FOR LORD ELLENBOROUGH]      _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    WHITEHALL, _5th May 1844._    Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, and believing  that he is acting in accordance with your Majesty's own opinion,  begs leave to submit to your Majesty that it may be advisable that he  should by the present mail inform Lord Ellenborough that it is your  Majesty's intention to confer on him, at a very early period, as a  mark of your Majesty's approval of Lord Ellenborough's conduct and  services in India, the rank of an Earl and the Grand Cross of the  Bath.    Lord Ellenborough may be at liberty (should your Majesty approve) to  notify this publicly in India--and thus make it known that the general  line of policy recently pursued has had the full sanction of your  Majesty, and will not be departed from.    These were the honours conferred upon Lord Auckland.    If they were conferred _on the instant_, it might rather seem a rebuke  to the East India Company than a deliberate approval of the conduct  of Lord Ellenborough, but these honours might shortly follow  the conclusion of the affair respecting the selection of Lord  Ellenborough's successor, and any discussion that may arise in  Parliament.          [Pageheading: THE PRINCE DE JOINVILLE'S _BROCHURE_]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    CLAREMONT, _24th May 1844._    DEAREST UNCLE,--Though _not_ my day I must write you a line to say  _how vexed_ we are at this _most unfortunate_ and _most imprudent  brochure_ of Joinville's;[12] it has made a _very bad_ effect here,  and will rouse all the envy and hatred between the _two Navies_ again,  which it was our great effort to subdue--and this _all_ for _nothing!_  I can't tell you how angry people are, and how poor Hadjy will get  abused. And this _all_ after our having been on such intimate terms  with him and having _sailed_ with him! If he comes here, _what_ shall  we do? Receive with open arms one who has talked of ravaging our  coasts and burning our towns? Indeed it is most lamentable; you know  how we like him, and that therefore it must be very annoying to us to  see him get himself into such a scrape. _We_ shall overlook it, but  the people _here_ won't! It _will_ blow over, but it will do immense  harm. We who wish to become more and more closely united with the  French family are, of course, much put out by this return. We  shall forgive and forget, and feel it was _not_ intended to be  published--but the public _here_ will _not_ so easily, and will put  the worst construction on it all.    Pray, dearest Uncle, tell me what _could_ possess Joinville to write  it, and still more to have it printed? Won't it annoy the King and  Nemours very much? _Enfin c'est malheureux, c'est indiscret au plus  haut degre_--and it provokes and vexes us sadly. Tell me _all_ you  _know_ and think about it; for you _can_ do so with perfect safety by  our courier.    I have written dearest Louise an account of my _old_ birthday, which  will please you, I think. The weather is very fine. Ever your _truly_  devoted Niece and Child,    VICTORIA R.    [Footnote 12: The _brochure_ was entitled, _Notes sur les forces  navales de la France_. The Prince de Joinville wrote as follows to the  Queen: \"Le malheureux eclat de ma brochure, le tracas que cela donne  au Pere et a la Reine, me font regretter vivement de l'avoir faite.  Comme je l'ecris a ton Roi, je ne renvoie que mepris a toutes les  interpretations qu'on y donne; ce que peuvent dire ministre et  journaux ne me touche en rien, mais il n'y a pas de sacrifices que je  ne suis dispose a faire pour l'interieur de la Famille.\"]          [Pageheading: THE CZAR NICHOLAS]      _Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen._    _29th May 1844._    If Lord Aberdeen should not have read the Prince de Joinville's  pamphlet, the Queen recommends him to do so, as one cannot judge  fairly by the extracts in the newspapers. Though it does not lessen  the extreme imprudence of the Prince's publishing what must do harm  to the various French Governments, it certainly is _not_"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#4)"],[1,"L. 4s.    \"    38. _William's Vision of Piers the Plowman_, Part II.
