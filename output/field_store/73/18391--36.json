As they swam along through the steaming bath  other men were posted midway and when a sheep passed they thrust the  head twice under water with their crooks so that the eyes and heads--as  well as the bodies--might be cleansed. At the far end of the troughs  still other herders helped the bedraggled creatures out onto a draining  platform where they dripped for a time and were afterward driven back  into their pens.    \"I shouldn't think the sheep would ever dry!\" Donald remarked to Sandy  as they watched the process.    \"Oh, they do; only it takes a couple of days--and sometimes more before  their wool is thoroughly dry,\" answered the Scotchman.    Donald looked on, fascinated.    The work proceeded without a hitch.    The sheep were fed into the troughs, hurried on and away, only to give  place to others. Whenever the dip cooled a fresh, hot supply was added.  Within an hour Donald counted a hundred sheep swim their way through the  one trough near which he chanced to be standing.    Sandy McCulloch was everywhere at once--now here, now there, giving  orders. Gladly the herders obeyed him. They all liked Sandy, not only  for his own sake but for the sake of Old Angus, his father, under whom  most of them had worked in years past.    \"Sandy's a fine lad!\" Donald heard one of the herders say.    \"There's not a better on Crescent Ranch!\" was the prompt reply from a  grizzled old Mexican who was ducking the heads of the herd that sped  past him.    \"He wouldn't make a bad boss of the ranch,\" murmured another in an  undertone.    [Illustration: \"HE WOULDN'T MAKE A BAD BOSS\"]    Sandy did not hear them. He was too intent on his work. He went about it  simply, yet with his whole soul. Day after day his cheery voice could  be heard:    \"Your dip is cooling, Bernardo! Warm it up a bit. Dinna you know you'll  have your labor for your pains unless the stuff is hot as the sheep can  bear it? Hurry your flock ahead there, Jose. Think you we want to be  dipping sheep the rest of the season? If those ewes have drained off  enough let the dogs drive them back to the pens. They'll rub their sides  up against the boards and cleanse the pen as well as themselves. Now  bring out the new herd that came last week from Kansas City. You'll find  them in pens seventeen and eighteen. We kept them by themselves so they  would scatter no disease through the flock. After they are dipped they  can be put with the others.\"    The men took all he said good-naturedly. Sandy used no unnecessary  words, but what he did say was crisp and to the point, and the herders  liked it. They liked, too, to watch his face when his lips parted and  his glistening white teeth gleamed between them. Sandy had a very  contagious smile. He worked tirelessly, and ever as he moved about among  the sheep two great Scotch collies tagged at his heels. Busy as he was  he often bent down to pat one of the shaggy heads, and was rewarded by  having the beautiful dogs thrust their long noses into his hand or rub  up against his knees. It was amusing to Donald to watch these dogs dash  after the sheep and drive them into the pens. Sometimes they leaped on  the backs of the herd and ran the entire length of the line until they  reached the ones at the front. They then proceeded to bite the necks of  these leaders until they turned them in the desired direction. This  done, the collies would run back and by nipping the heels of the sheep  at the rear they would compel them to follow where they wished to have  them go.    Donald had never seen anything like it.    During the time that the dipping process continued he did not lack for  entertainment, you may be sure.    \"You'll soon have nothing more to do, Sandy,\" the boy said one night  when he and the Scotchman were sitting in the twilight on the steps of  the big barn.    \"How's that, laddie?\"    \"Why, the dipping will be over to-morrow, won't it?\"    \"Yes; but that is only the beginning of trouble. We shall then put the  herd out in the wet grass a while and soften their hoofs so they can be  trimmed before the flocks start for the range. Then the bells must be  put on, and the bands of sheep made up for the herders.\"    \"What do you mean by making up the herd?\"    \"I'll try to tell you. Sheep, you must know, are the queerest creatures  under the blue of heaven. It ain't in the power of man to understand  them. Some minutes they are doing as you'd likely think they would; the  next thing you know they are all stampeding off by themselves, and try  as you will you cannot stop 'em. They dinna seem sometimes to have a bit  of brains.\"    Donald laughed.    \"Aye! You may well laugh, sitting here, but it's no so funny when they  go chasing after the leaders and jumping over the face of some cliff.  Think of seeing a hundred of 'em piled up dead at your feet!\"    \"Did such a thing as that really ever happen, Sandy?\" questioned Donald  incredulously.    \"It did so. Didn't bears get after a flock on one of the ranges and  didn't the whole lot of scared creatures start running? If they had but  waited either the dogs or the herders might have driven off the bears.  But no! Nothing would do but they must run--and run they did. One after  another they leaped over the edge of the rimrock until most of the flock  was destroyed. Folks named the place 'Pile-Up Chasm.' It was a sorry  loss to the owner.\"    \"But I don't see why----\"    \"No, nor anybody else,\" interrupted Sandy. \"That's the sort of thing  they do. When they are frightened they never make a sound--they just  run. If nobody heads them off they are like to run to their death; and  when anybody does head them off it must be done carefully or the front  ones will wheel about and pile up on all those coming toward them. Lots  of sheep are killed in this way. They trample each other to death. Why,  once a man down in Glen City was driving a big flock along when around a  turn in the road came a motor-truck. The sheep got scared and the front  ones whisked straight about. That started others. Soon there was a grand  mix-up--sheep all panic-stricken and tramping over each other. The owner  lost half his herd. Now you see why we have to have leaders.\"    \"Leaders?\"    \"Yes. That is one part of making up the herds. We must put some sheep  that are wiser than the rest in every flock that they may lead the  stupid ones. I dinna ken where they'd be if we didn't. We take as  leaders sheep that are 'flock-wise'--by that I mean old ewes or wethers  that have long been in the herds and know the ways. Sometimes, also, we  put in a goat or two, for a goat has the wit to find water and food for  himself. Not so the sheep! Never a bit! You have to lead sheep clean up  to grass and to water as well. They can never find anything for  themselves.\"    \"Do they know anything at all, Sandy?\" queried Donald, laughing.    \"They do so. In some ways they are canny enough. They will scent a  storm, and when one is coming never a peg will they stir to graze. They  give a queer cry, too, when they find water--a cry to tell the others in  the flock; and if the water is brackish or tainted they make a different  sound as if to warn the herd. Sheep are very fussy about what they  drink. It's a strange lot they are, sure enough!\"    \"I shouldn't think they would know enough to follow their leaders even  if they had any,\" remarked Donald.    \"Well, you see there is a sort of instinct born in 'em to tag after each  other. Besides, they learn to follow by playing games. Yes, indeed,\"  protested Sandy, as Donald seemed to doubt his words, \"sheep are very  fond of games. There are a number of different ones that they play. The  one they seem to like best is 'Follow the Leader.' I don't know as you  ever played it, but when I was a lad I did.\"    \"Of course I have played it. We used to do it at recess.\"    \"Well, the sheep like it as well as you, and it is a lucky thing, for it  teaches them one of the very things we want them to learn. They will  often start out, one old sheep at the head, and all the others will fall  into line and do just what that sheep at the front does. So they learn  the trick of keeping their eyes on a few that are wiser than they, and  doing what the knowing ones do. They seem to have no minds of their  own--they just trail after their leaders. If we can get leaders that are  able to see what we want done it is a great help.\"    \"I should think so!\"    \"When we have selected our leaders we then scatter markers through each  band of sheep.\"    \"And what are markers, Sandy?\"    \"For a marker you must take a black-faced sheep--or, mayhap, one with a  crumpled horn; he must have something queer about him so you will know  him right off when he is mixed in with the flock. We put these markers  at the beginning of every hundred sheep. It makes it easier to keep  track of the herd.\"    \"I'm sorry to be so stupid, Sandy,\" Donald said, \"but I don't think I  just understand about the markers.\"    \"We have two thousand sheep in a band,\" explained the herder kindly.  \"Now if one of our markers is missing we reckon that a hundred sheep are  gone. No one sheep ever strays off by himself, you may be sure of that.  When sheep stray they stray in bunches. If a marker wanders off you can  safely figure that a lot of those around him have gone too. Roughly  speaking we call it a hundred.\"    \"But when you have such big bands of sheep and they are moving about I  should not think the markers would be in the same place twice,\"  persisted Donald, determined to fathom this puzzling problem.    \"You dinna ken sheep, laddie! They are as jealous to keep their rightful  place in the flock as school children are to get the first place in the  line. They will fight and fight if another takes the position that  belongs to them. It is a silly idea, but an aid to the herders.\"    \"And so the leaders and these markers really help the shepherds to  manage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#4)"],[1,"the Lord who rules the sky,  The Gods and heavenly saints drew nigh,  And honoured him with worthy meed,  Rejoicing in each glorious deed.  His task achieved, his foe removed,  He triumphed, by the Gods approved.  By grace of Heaven he raised to life  The chieftains slain in mortal strife;  Then in the magic chariot through  The clouds to Nandigrama flew.  Met by his faithful brothers there,  He loosed his votive coil of hair:  Thence fair Ayodhya's town he gained,  And o'er his father's kingdom reigned.  Disease or famine ne'er oppressed  His happy people, richly blest  With all the joys of ample wealth,  Of sweet content and perfect health.  No widow mourned her well-loved mate,  No sire his son's untimely fate.  They feared not storm or robber's hand;  No fire or flood laid waste the land:  The Golden Age(40) had come again  To bless the days of Rama's reign.      From him, the great and glorious king,  Shall many a princely scion spring.  And he shall rule, beloved by men,  Ten thousand years and hundreds ten,(41)  And when his life on earth is past  To Brahma's world shall go at last.\"      Whoe'er this noble poem reads  That tells the tale of Rama's deeds,  Good as the Scriptures, he shall be  From every sin and blemish free.  Whoever reads the saving strain,  With all his kin the heavens shall gain.  Brahmans who read shall gather hence  The highest praise for eloquence.  The warrior, o'er the land shall reign,  The merchant, luck in trade obtain;  And Sudras listening(42) ne'er shall fail  To reap advantage from the tale.(43)          Canto II. Brahma's Visit      Valmiki, graceful speaker, heard,  To highest admiration stirred.  To him whose fame the tale rehearsed  He paid his mental worship first;  Then with his pupil humbly bent  Before the saint most eloquent.  Thus honoured and dismissed the seer  Departed to his heavenly sphere.  Then from his cot Valmiki hied  To Tamasa's(44) sequestered side,  Not far remote from Ganga's tide.  He stood and saw the ripples roll  Pellucid o'er a pebbly shoal.  To Bharadvaja(45) by his side  He turned in ecstasy, and cried:  \"See, pupil dear, this lovely sight,  The smooth-floored shallow, pure and bright,  With not a speck or shade to mar,  And clear as good men's bosoms are.  Here on the brink thy pitcher lay,  And bring my zone of bark, I pray.  Here will I bathe: the rill has not,  To lave the limbs, a fairer spot.  Do quickly as I bid, nor waste  The precious time; away, and haste.\"      Obedient to his master's hest  Quick from the cot he brought the vest;  The hermit took it from his hand,  And tightened round his waist the band;  Then duly dipped and bathed him there,  And muttered low his secret prayer.  To spirits and to Gods he made  Libation of the stream, and strayed  Viewing the forest deep and wide  That spread its shade on every side.  Close by the bank he saw a pair  Of curlews sporting fearless there.  But suddenly with evil mind  An outcast fowler stole behind,  And, with an aim too sure and true,  The male bird near the hermit slew.  The wretched hen in wild despair  With fluttering pinions beat the air,  And shrieked a long and bitter cry  When low on earth she saw him lie,  Her loved companion, quivering, dead,  His dear wings with his lifeblood red;  And for her golden crested mate  She mourned, and was disconsolate.      The hermit saw the slaughtered bird,  And all his heart with ruth was stirred.  The fowler's impious deed distressed  His gentle sympathetic breast,  And while the curlew's sad cries rang  Within his ears, the hermit sang:  \"No fame be thine for endless time,  Because, base outcast, of thy crime,  Whose cruel hand was fain to slay  One of this gentle pair at play!\"  E'en as he spoke his bosom wrought  And laboured with the wondering thought  What was the speech his ready tongue  Had uttered when his heart was wrung.  He pondered long upon the speech,  Recalled the words and measured each,  And thus exclaimed the saintly guide  To Bharadvaja by his side:  \"With equal lines of even feet,  With rhythm and time and tone complete,  The measured form of words I spoke  In shock of grief be termed a sloke.\"(46)  And Bharadvaja, nothing slow  His faithful love and zeal to show,  Answered those words of wisdom, \"Be  The name, my lord, as pleases thee.\"      As rules prescribe the hermit took  Some lustral water from the brook.  But still on this his constant thought  Kept brooding, as his home he sought;  While Bharadvaja paced behind,  A pupil sage of lowly mind,  And in his hand a pitcher bore  With pure fresh water brimming o'er.  Soon as they reached their calm retreat  The holy hermit took his seat;  His mind from worldly cares recalled,  And mused in deepest thought enthralled.      Then glorious Brahma,(47) Lord Most High,  Creator of the earth and sky,  The four-faced God, to meet the sage  Came to Valmiki's hermitage.  Soon as the mighty God he saw,  Up sprang the saint in wondering awe.  Mute, with clasped hands, his head he bent,  And stood before him reverent.  His honoured guest he greeted well,  Who bade him of his welfare tell;  Gave water for his blessed feet,  Brought offerings,(48) and prepared a seat.  In honoured place the God Most High  Sate down, and bade the saint sit nigh.  There sate before Valmiki's eyes  The Father of the earth and skies;  But still the hermit's thoughts were bent  On one thing only, all intent  On that poor curlew's mournful fate  Lamenting for her slaughtered mate;  And still his lips, in absent mood,  The verse that told his grief, renewed:  \"Woe to the fowler's impious hand  That did the deed that folly planned;  That could to needless death devote  The curlew of the tuneful throat!\"      The heavenly Father smiled in glee,  And said, \"O best of hermits, see,  A verse, unconscious, thou hast made;  No longer be the task delayed.  Seek not to trace, with labour vain,  The unpremeditated strain.  The tuneful lines thy lips rehearsed  Spontaneous from thy bosom burst.  Then come, O best of seers, relate  The life of Rama good and great,  The tale that saintly Narad told,  In all its glorious length unfold.  Of all the deeds his arm has done  Upon this earth, omit not one,  And thus the noble life record  Of that wise, brave, and virtuous lord.  His every act to day displayed,  His secret life to none betrayed:  How Lakshman, how the giants fought;  With high emprise and hidden thought:  And all that Janak's child(49) befell  Where all could see, where none could tell.  The whole of this shall truly be  Made known, O best of saints, to thee.  In all thy poem, through my grace,  No word of falsehood shall have place.  Begin the story, and rehearse  The tale divine in charming verse.  As long as in this firm-set land  The streams shall flow, the mountains stand,  So long throughout the world, be sure,  The great Ramayan shall endure.(50)  While the Ramayan's ancient strain  Shall glorious in the earth remain,  To higher spheres shalt thou arise  And dwell with me above the skies.\"      He spoke, and vanished into air,  And left Valmiki wondering there.  The pupils of the holy man,  Moved by their love of him, began  To chant that verse, and ever more  They marvelled as they sang it o'er:  \"Behold, the four-lined balanced rime,  Repeated over many a time,  In words that from the hermit broke  In shock of grief, becomes a sloke.\"  This measure now Valmiki chose  Wherein his story to compose.  In hundreds of such verses, sweet  With equal lines and even feet,  The saintly poet, lofty-souled,  The glorious deeds of Rama told.          Canto III. The Argument.      The hermit thus with watchful heed  Received the poem's pregnant seed,  And looked with eager thought around  If fuller knowledge might be found.  His lips with water first bedewed,(51)  He sate, in reverent attitude  On holy grass,(52) the points all bent  Together toward the orient;(53)  And thus in meditation he  Entered the path of poesy.  Then clearly, through his virtue's might,  All lay discovered to his sight,  Whate'er befell, through all their life,  Rama, his brother, and his wife:  And Dasaratha and each queen  At every time, in every scene:  His people too, of every sort;  The nobles of his princely court:  Whate'er was said, whate'er decreed,  Each time they sate each plan and deed:  For holy thought and fervent rite  Had so refined his keener sight  That by his sanctity his view  The present, past, and future knew,  And he with mental eye could grasp,  Like fruit within his fingers clasp,  The life of Rama, great and good,  Roaming with Sita in the wood.  He told, with secret-piercing eyes,  The tale of Rama's high emprise,  Each listening ear that shall entice,  A sea of pearls of highest price.  Thus good Valmiki, sage divine,  Rehearsed the tale of Raghu's line,  As Narad, heavenly saint, before  Had traced the story's outline o'er.  He sang of Rama's princely birth,  His kindness and heroic worth;  His love for all, his patient youth,  His gentleness and constant truth,  And many a tale and legend old  By holy Visvamitra told.  How Janak's child he wooed and won,  And broke the bow that bent to none.  How he with every virtue fraught  His namesake Rama(54) met and fought.  The choice of Rama for the throne;  The malice by Kaikeyi shown,  Whose evil counsel marred the plan  And drove him forth a banisht man.  How the king grieved and groaned, and cried,  And swooned away and pining died.  The subjects' woe when thus bereft;  And how the following crowds he left:  With Guha talked, and firmly stern  Ordered his driver to return.  How Ganga's farther shore he gained;  By Bharadvaja entertained,  By whose advice he journeyed still  And came to Chitrakuta's hill.  How there he dwelt and built a cot;  How Bharat journeyed to the spot;  His earnest supplication made;  Drink-offerings to their father paid;  The sandals given by Rama's hand,  As emblems of his right, to stand:  How from his presence Bharat went  And"]]]
