[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2753"],[0,"Ali Pacha (#4)"],[1,"the habit of going every day, after hunting, for a siesta in a  neighbouring wood. A confidential servant of mine suggested to my  enemies the idea of surprising me and assassinating one there. I myself  supplied the plan of the conspiracy, which was adopted. On the day  agreed upon, I preceded my adversaries to the place where I was  accustomed to repose, and caused a goat to be pinioned and muzzled, and  fastened under the tree, covered with my cape; I then returned home by a  roundabout path. Soon after I had left, the conspirators arrived, and  fired a volley at the goat.    \"They ran up to make certain of my death, but were interrupted by a  piquet of my men, who unexpectedly emerged from a copse where I had  posted them, and they were obliged to return to Tepelen, which they  entered, riotous with joy, crying 'Ali Bey is dead, now we are free!'  This news reached my harem, and I heard the cries of my mother and my  wife mingled with the shouts of my enemies. I allowed the commotion to  run its course and reach its height, so as to indicate which were my  friends and which my foes. But when the former were at the depth of  their distress and the latter at the height of their joy, and, exulting  in their supposed victory, had drowned their prudence and their courage  in floods of wine, then, strong in the justice of my cause, I appeared  upon the scene. Now was the time for my friends to triumph and for my  foes to tremble. I set to work at the head of my partisans, and before  sunrise had exterminated the last of my enemies. I distributed their  lands, their houses, and their goods amongst my followers, and from that  moment I could call the town of Tepelen my own.\"    A less ambitious man might perhaps have remained satisfied with such a  result. But Ali did not look upon the suzerainty of a canton as a final  object, but only as a means to an end; and he had not made himself  master of Tepelen to limit himself to a petty state, but to employ it as  a base of operations.    He had allied himself to Ali of Argyro-Castron to get rid of his  enemies; once free from them, he began to plot against his supplanter.  He forgot neither his vindictive projects nor his ambitious schemes. As  prudent in execution as bold in design, he took good care not to openly  attack a man stronger than himself, and gained by stratagem what he  could not obtain by violence. The honest and straightforward character  of his brother-in-law afforded an easy success to his perfidy. He began  by endeavouring to suborn his sister Chainitza, and several times  proposed to her to poison her husband; but she, who dearly loved the  pacha, who was a kind husband and to whom she had borne two children,  repulsed his suggestions with horror, and threatened, if he persisted,  to denounce him. Ali, fearing the consequences if she carried out her  threat, begged forgiveness for his wicked plans, pretended deep  repentance, and spoke of his brother-in-law in terms of the warmest  affection. His acting was so consummate that even Chainitza, who well  knew her brother's subtle character, was deceived by it. When he saw  that she was his dupe, knowing that he had nothing more either to fear  or to hope for from that side, he directed his attention to another.    The pacha had a brother named Soliman, whose character nearly resembled  that of Tepeleni. The latter, after having for some time quietly studied  him, thought he discerned in him the man he wanted; he tempted him to  kill the pacha, offering him, as the price of this crime, his whole  inheritance and the hand of Chainitza, only reserving for himself the  long coveted sanjak. Soliman accepted the proposals, and the fratricidal  bargain was concluded. The two conspirators, sole masters of the secret,  the horrible nature of which guaranteed their mutual fidelity, and  having free access to the person of their victim; could not fail in  their object.    One day, when they were both received by the pacha in private audience,  Soliman, taking advantage of a moment when he was unobserved, drew a  pistol from his belt and blew out his brother's brains. Chainitza ran at  the sound, and saw her husband lying dead between her brother and her  brother-in-law. Her cries for help were stopped by threats of death if  she moved or uttered a sound. As she lay, fainting with grief and  terror, Ali made, a sign to Soliman, who covered her with his cloak, and  declared her his wife. Ali pronounced the marriage concluded, and  retired for it to be consummated. Thus was celebrated this frightful  wedding, in the scene of an awful crime; beside the corpse of a man who  a moment before had been the husband of the bride and the brother of the  bridegroom.    The assassins published the death of the pacha, attributing it, as is  usual in Turkey, to a fit of cerebral apoplexy. But the truth soon  leaked out from the lying shrouds in which it had been wrapped. Reports  even exceeded the truth, and public opinion implicated Chainitza in a  crime of which she had been but the witness. Appearances certainly  justified these suspicions. The young wife had soon consoled herself in  the arms of her second husband for the loss of the first, and her son by  him presently died suddenly, thus leaving Soliman in lawful and peaceful  possession of all his brother's wealth. As for the little girl, as she  had no rights and could hurt no one, her life was spared; and she was  eventually married to a bey of Cleisoura, destined in the sequel to cut  a tragic figure in the history of the Tepeleni family.    But Ali was once more deprived of the fruit of his bloody schemes.  Notwithstanding all his intrigues, the sanjak of Delvino was conferred,  not upon him, but upon a bey of one of the first families of Zapouria.  But, far from being discouraged, he recommenced with new boldness and  still greater confidence the work of his elevation, so often begun and  so often interrupted. He took advantage of his increasing influence to  ingratiate himself with the new pasha, and was so successful in  insinuating himself into his confidence, that he was received into the  palace and treated like the pacha's son. There he acquired complete  knowledge of the details of the pachalik and the affairs of the pacha,  preparing himself to govern the one when he had got rid of the other.    The sanjak of Delvino was bounded from Venetian territory by the  district of Buthrotum. Selim, a better neighbour and an abler politician  than his predecessors, sought to renew and preserve friendly commercial  relations with the purveyors of the Magnificent Republic. This wise  conduct, equally advantageous for both the bordering provinces, instead  of gaining for the pacha the praise and favours which he deserved,  rendered him suspected at a court whose sole political idea was hatred  of the name of Christian, and whose sole means of government was terror.  Ali immediately perceived the pacha's error, and the advantage which he  himself could derive from it. Selim, as one of his commercial  transactions with the Venetians, had sold them, for a number of years,  the right of felling timber in a forest near Lake Reloda. Ali  immediately took advantage of this to denounce the pasha as guilty of  having alienated the territory of the Sublime Porte, and of a desire to  deliver to the infidels all the province of Delvino. Masking his  ambitious designs under the veil of religion and patriotism, he  lamented, in his denunciatory report, the necessity under which he found  himself, as a loyal subject and faithful Mussulman, of accusing a man  who had been his benefactor, and thus at the same time gained the  benefit of crime and the credit of virtue.    Under the gloomy despotism of the Turks, a man in any position of  responsibility is condemned almost as soon as accused; and if he is not  strong enough to inspire terror, his ruin is certain. Ali received at  Tepelen, where he had retired to more conveniently weave his perfidious  plots, an order to get rid of the pacha. At the receipt of the firman of  execution he leaped with joy, and flew to Delvino to seize the prey  which was abandoned to him.    The noble Selim, little suspecting that his protege had become his  accuser and was preparing to become his executioner, received him with  more tenderness than ever, and lodged him, as heretofore, in his palace.  Under the shadow of this hospitable roof, Ali skilfully prepared the  consummation of the crime which was for ever to draw him out of  obscurity. He went every morning to pay his court to the pacha, whose  confidence he doubted; then, one day, feigning illness, he sent excuses  for inability to pay his respects to a man whom he was accustomed to  regard as his father, and begged him to come for a moment into his  apartment. The invitation being accepted, he concealed assassins in one  of the cupboards without shelves, so common in the East, which contain  by day the mattresses spread by night on the floor for the slaves to  sleep upon. At the hour fixed, the old man arrived. Ali rose from his  sofa with a depressed air, met him, kissed the hem of his robe, and,  after seating him in his place, himself offered him a pipe-and coffee,  which were accepted. But instead of putting the cup in the hand  stretched to receive it, he let it fall on the floor, where it broke  into a thousand pieces. This was the signal. The assassins sprang from  their retreat and darted upon Selim, who fell, exclaiming, like Caesar,  \"And it is thou, my son, who takest my life!\"    At the sound of the tumult which followed the assassination, Selim's  bodyguard, running up, found Ali erect, covered with blood, surrounded  by assassins, holding in his hand the firman displayed, and crying with  a menacing voice, \"I have killed the traitor Selim by the order of our  glorious sultan; here is his imperial command.\" At these words, and the  sight of the fatal diploma, all prostrated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2754"],[0,"The Countess of Saint Geran (#4)"],[1,"to stop the chatter of the servants'  hall, and thenceforward the lovers could enjoy free intercourse.    One evening, as the Marquis de Saint-Maixent was at supper in company  with the marchioness, a loud knocking was heard at the gate of the  chateau, to which they paid no great attention. This was followed by the  appearance of a courier who had come post haste from Paris; he entered  the courtyard with a letter from the Count de Saint-Geran for M. the  marquis; he was announced and introduced, followed by nearly all the  household. The marquis asked the meaning of all this, and dismissed all  the following with a wave of the hand; but the courier explained that M.  the count desired that the letter in his hands should be read before  everyone. The marquis opened it without replying, glanced over it, and  read it out loud without the slightest alteration: the count announced  to his good relations and to all his household that the countess had  indicated positive symptoms of pregnancy; that hardly had she arrived in  Paris when she suffered from fainting fits, nausea, retching, that she  bore with joy these premonitory indications, which were no longer a  matter of doubt to the physicians, nor to anyone; that for his part he  was overwhelmed with joy at this event, which was the crowning stroke to  all his wishes; that he desired the chateau to share his satisfaction by  indulging in all kinds of gaieties; and that so far as other matters  were concerned they could remain as they were till the return of himself  and the countess, which the letter would precede only a few days, as he  was going to transport her in a litter for greater safety. Then followed  the specification of certain sums of money to be distributed among the  servants.    The servants uttered cries of joy; the marquis and marchioness exchanged  a look, but a very troublous one; they, however, restrained themselves  so far as to simulate a great satisfaction, and the marquis brought  himself to congratulate the servants on their attachment to their master  and mistress. After this they were left alone, looking very serious,  while crackers exploded and violins resounded under the windows. For  some time they preserved silence, the first thought which occurred to  both being that the count and countess had allowed themselves to be  deceived by trifling symptoms, that people had wished to flatter their  hopes, that it was impossible for a constitution to change so suddenly  after twenty years, and that it was a case of simulative pregnancy. This  opinion gaining strength in their minds made them somewhat calmer.    The next day they took a walk side by side in a solitary path in the  park and discussed the chances of their situation. M. de Saint-Maixent  brought before the marchioness the enormous injury which this event  would bring them. He then said that even supposing the news to be true,  there were many rocks ahead to be weathered before the succession could  be pronounced secure.    \"The child may die,\" he said at last.    And he uttered some sinister expressions on the slight damage caused by  the loss of a puny creature without mind, interest, or consequence;  nothing, he said, but a bit of ill-organised matter, which only came  into the world to ruin so considerable a person as the marchioness.    \"But what is the use of tormenting ourselves?\" he went on impatiently;  \"the countess is not pregnant, nor can she be.\"    A gardener working near them overheard this part of the conversation,  but as they walked away from him he could not hear any more.    A few days later, some outriders, sent before him by the count, entered  the chateau, saying that their master and mistress were close at hand.  In fact, they were promptly followed by brakes and travelling-carriages,  and at length the countess's litter was descried, which M. de  Saint-Geran, on horse back, had never lost sight of during the journey.  It was a triumphal reception: all the peasants had left their work, and  filled the air with shouts of welcome; the servants ran to meet their  mistress; the ancient retainers wept for joy at seeing the count so  happy and in the hope that his noble qualities might be perpetuated in  his heir. The marquis and Madame de Bouille did their best to tune up to  the pitch of this hilarity.    The dowager countess, who had arrived at the chateau the same day,  unable to convince herself as to this news, had the pleasure of  satisfying her self respecting it. The count and countess were much  beloved in the Bourbonnais province; this event caused therein a general  satisfaction, particularly in the numerous houses attached to them by  consanguinity. Within a few days of their return, more than twenty  ladies of quality flocked to visit them in great haste, to show the  great interest they took in this pregnancy. All these ladies, on one  occasion or another, convinced themselves as to its genuineness, and  many of them, carrying the subject still further, in a joking manner  which pleased the countess, dubbed themselves prophetesses, and  predicted the birth of a boy. The usual symptoms incidental to the  situation left no room for doubt: the country physicians were all  agreed. The count kept one of these physicians in the chateau for two  months, and spoke to the Marquis of Saint-Maixent of his intention of  procuring a good mid-wife, on the same terms. Finally, the dowager  countess, who was to be sponsor, ordered at a great expense a  magnificent store of baby linen, which she desired to present at the  birth.    The marchioness devoured her rage, and among the persons who went beside  themselves with joy not one remarked the disappointment which overspread  her soul. Every day she saw the marquis, who did all he could to  increase her regret, and incessantly stirred up her ill-humour by  repeating that the count and countess were triumphing over her  misfortune, and insinuating that they were importing a supposititious  child to disinherit her. As usual both in private and political affairs,  he began by corrupting the marchioness's religious views, to pervert her  into crime. The marquis was one of those libertines so rare at that  time, a period less unhappy than is generally believed, who made science  dependent upon, atheism. It is remarkable that great criminals of this  epoch, Sainte-Croix for instance, and Exili, the gloomy poisoner, were  the first unbelievers, and that they preceded the learned of the  following age both, in philosophy and in the exclusive study of physical  science, in which they included that of poisons. Passion, interest,  hatred fought the marquis's battles in the heart of Madame de Bouille;  she readily lent herself to everything that M. de Saint-Maixent wished.    The Marquis de Saint-Maixent had a confidential servant, cunning,  insolent, resourceful, whom he had brought from his estates, a servant  well suited to such a master, whom he sent on errands frequently into  the neighbourhood of Saint-Geran.    One evening, as the marquis was about to go to bed, this man, returning  from one of his expeditions, entered his room, where he remained for a  long time, telling him that he had at length found what he wanted, and  giving him a small piece of paper which contained several names of  places and persons.    Next morning, at daybreak, the marquis caused two of his horses to be  saddled, pretended that he was summoned home on pressing business,  foresaw that he should be absent for three or four days, made his  excuses to the count, and set off at full gallop, followed by his  servant.    They slept that night at an inn on the road to Auvergne, to put off the  scent any persons who might recognise them; then, following  cross-country roads, they arrived after two days at a large hamlet,  which they had seemed to have passed far to their left.    In this hamlet was a woman who practised the avocation of midwife, and  was known as such in the neighbourhood, but who had, it was said,  mysterious and infamous secrets for those who paid her well. Further,  she drew a good income from the influence which her art gave her over  credulous people. It was all in her line to cure the king's evil,  compound philtres and love potions; she was useful in a variety of ways  to girls who could afford to pay her; she was a lovers' go-between, and  even practised sorcery for country folk. She played her cards so well,  that the only persons privy to her misdeeds were unfortunate creatures  who had as strong an interest as herself in keeping them profoundly  secret; and as her terms were very high, she lived comfortably enough in  a house her own property, and entirely alone, for greater security. In a  general way, she was considered skilful in her ostensible profession,  and was held in estimation by many persons of rank. This woman's name  was Louise Goillard.    Alone one evening after curfew, she heard a loud knocking at the door of  her house. Accustomed to receive visits at all hours, she took her lamp  without hesitation, and opened the door. An armed man, apparently much  agitated, entered the room. Louise Goillard, in a great fright, fell  into a chair; this man was the Marquis de Saint-Maixent.    \"Calm yourself, good woman,\" said the stranger, panting and stammering;  \"be calm, I beg; for it is I, not you, who have any cause for emotion. I  am not a brigand, and far from your having anything to fear, it is I, on  the contrary, who am come to beg for your assistance.\"    He threw his cloak into a corner, unbuckled his waistbelt, and laid  aside his sword. Then falling into a chair, he said--    \"First of all, let me rest a little.\"    The marquis wore a travelling-dress; but although he had not stated his  name, Louise Goillard saw at a glance that he was a very different  person from what she had thought, and that, on the contrary, he was some  fine gentleman who had come on his love affairs.    \"I beg you to"]]]
