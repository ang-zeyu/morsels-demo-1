The Jameson  invasion was only three years old; and the passions it evoked had not  subsided. In it British officers, and troops flying the British flag, if  not Britain herself, had been wrongdoers. Suspicions of British good  faith were known to pervade the Boer mind, and would give an ominous  colour to every demand coming from Britain. The lapse of time might  diminish these suspicions, and give to negotiations a better prospect of  success. Time, moreover, was likely to work against the existing system  of the Transvaal. Bad governments carry the seeds of their own  dissolution. The reforming party among the Transvaal burghers would gain  strength, and try to throw off the existing _regime_. The President was  an old man, whose retirement from power could not be long delayed; and  no successor would be able to hold together as he had done the party of  resistance to reform. In the strife of factions that would follow his  retirement reform was certain to have a far better chance than it could  have had since 1895. In fact, to put it shortly, all the natural forces  were working for the Uitlanders, and would either open the way for their  admission to a share in power, or else make the task of Britain easier  by giving her less united and therefore less formidable antagonists.  These considerations counselled a postponement of the attempt to bring  matters to a crisis.    In the second place the British Government had to remember the  importance of carrying the opinion of the Dutch in Cape Colony, and, as  far as possible, even of the Orange Free State, with them in any action  they might take. It has been pointed out how before December, 1895, that  opinion blamed the Transvaal Government for its unfriendly treatment of  the immigrants. The Dutch of both communities had nothing to gain and  something to lose by the maladministration of the Transvaal, so that  they were nowise disposed to support it in refusing reforms. The only  thing that would make them rally to it would be a menace to its  independence, regarding which they, and especially the Free State  people, were extremely sensitive. Plainly, therefore, unless the  colonial Dutch were to be incensed and the Free State men turned to  enemies, such a menace was to be avoided.    Finally, the British authorities were bound to make sure, not only that  they had an adequate _casus belli_ which they could present to their own  people and to the world, but also that the gain to be expected from  immediately redressing the grievances of the Uitlander outweighed the  permanent evils war would entail. Even where, according to the usage of  nations, a just cause for war exists, even where victory in the war may  be reckoned on, the harm to be expected may be greater than the fruits  of victory. Here the harm was evident. The cost of equipping a large  force and transporting it across many thousand miles of sea was the  smallest part of the harm. The alienation of more than half the  population of Cape Colony, the destruction of a peaceful and prosperous  Republic with which Britain had no quarrel, the responsibility for  governing the Transvaal when conquered, with its old inhabitants  bitterly hostile, these were evils so grave, that the benefits to be  secured to the Uitlanders might well seem small in comparison. A nation  is, no doubt, bound to protect its subjects. But it could hardly be said  that the hardships of this group of subjects, which did not prevent  others from flocking into the country, and which were no worse than they  had been for some time previously, were such as to forbid the exercise  of a little more patience. It was said by the war party among the  English in South Africa that patience was being mistaken for weakness,  and that the credit of Britain was being lowered all over the world, and  even among the peoples of India, by her forbearance towards the  Transvaal. Absurd as this notion may appear, it was believed by heated  partizans on the spot. But outside Africa, and especially in Europe, the  forbearance of one of the four greatest Powers in the world towards a  community of seventy thousand people was in no danger of being  misunderstood.    Whether the force of these considerations, obvious to every unbiased  mind which had some knowledge of South Africa, was fully realized by  those who directed British policy, or whether, having realized their  force, they nevertheless judged war the better alternative, is a  question on which we are still in the dark. It is possible--and some of  the language used by the British authorities may appear to suggest this  explanation--that they entered on the negotiations which ended in war in  the belief that an attitude of menace would suffice to extort  submission, and being unable to recede from that attitude, found  themselves drawn on to a result which they had neither desired nor  contemplated. Be this as it may, the considerations above stated  prescribed the use of prudent and (as far as possible) conciliatory  methods in their diplomacy, as well as care in selecting a position  which would supply a legal justification for war, should war be found  the only issue.    This was the more necessary because the Boers were known to be intensely  suspicious. Every weak power trying to resist a stronger one must needs  take refuge in evasive and dilatory tactics. Such had been, such were  sure to be, the tactics of the Boers. But the Boers were also very  distrustful of the English Government, believing it to aim at nothing  less than the annexation of their country. It may seem strange to  Englishmen that the purity of their motives and the disinterestedness of  their efforts to spread good government and raise others to their own  level should be doubted. But the fact is--and this goes to the root of  the matter--that the Boers have regarded the policy of Britain towards  them as a policy of violence and duplicity. They recall how Natal was  conquered from them in 1842, after they had conquered it from the Zulus;  how their country was annexed in 1877, how the promises made at the time  of that annexation were broken. They were not appeased by the  retrocession of 1881, which they ascribed solely to British fear of a  civil war in South Africa. It should moreover be remembered,--and this  is a point which few people in England do remember--that they hold the  annexation to have been an act of high-handed lawlessness done in time  of peace, and have deemed themselves entitled to be replaced in the  position their republic held before 1877, under the Sand River  Convention of 1852. Since the invasion of December 1895, they have been  more suspicious than ever, for they believe the British Government to  have had a hand in that attempt, and they think that influential  capitalists have been sedulously scheming against them. Their passion  for independence is something which we in modern Europe find it hard to  realise. It recalls the long struggle of the Swiss for freedom in the  fourteenth century, or the fierce tenacity which the Scotch showed in  the same age in their resistance to the claim of England to be their  \"Suzerain Power.\" This passion was backed by two other sentiments, an  exaggerated estimate of their own strength and a reliance on the  protecting hand of Providence, fitter for the days of the Maccabees or  of Cromwell than for our own time, but which will appear less strange if  the perils through which their nation had passed be remembered.    These were the rocks among which the bark of British diplomacy had to be  steered. They were, however, rocks above water, so it might be hoped  that war could be avoided and some valuable concession secured. To be  landed in war would obviously be as great a failure as to secure no  concession.    Instead of demanding the removal of the specific grievances whereof the  Uitlanders complained, the British Government resolved to endeavour to  obtain for them an easier acquisition of the electoral franchise and an  ampler representation in the legislature. There was much to be said for  this course. It would avoid the tedious and vexatious controversies that  must have arisen over the details of the grievances. It would (in the  long run) secure reform in the best way, viz., by the action of public  spirit and enlightenment within the legislature. It would furnish a  basis for union between the immigrants and the friends of good  government among the burghers themselves, and so conduce to the future  peace of the community. There was, however, one material condition, a  condition which might prove to be an objection, affecting the resort to  it. Since the electoral franchise was a matter entirely within the  competence of the South African Republic, Britain must, if she desired  to abide by the principles of international law, confine herself to  recommendation and advice. She had no right to demand, no right to  insist that her advice should be followed. She could not compel  compliance by force, nor even by the threat of using force. In other  words, a refusal to enlarge the franchise would not furnish any _casus  belli_.    This course having been adopted, the negotiations entered on a new phase  with the Conference at Bloemfontein, where President Kruger met the  British High Commissioner. Such a direct interchange of views between  the leading representatives of two Powers may often be expedient,  because it helps the parties to get sooner to close quarters with the  substantial points of difference, and so facilitates a compromise. But  its utility depends on two conditions. Either the basis of discussion  should be arranged beforehand, leaving only minor matters to be  adjusted, or else the proceedings should be informal and private. At  Bloemfontein neither condition existed. No basis had been previously  arranged. The Conference was formal and (although the press were not  admitted) virtually"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],[0,"A Damsel in Distress (#4)"],[1," today he had noticed from the moment he had got out of bed that  something was amiss with the world. Either he was in the grip of  some divine discontent due to the highly developed condition of his  soul, or else he had a grouch. One of the two. Or it might have  been the reaction from the emotions of the previous night. On the  morning after an opening your sensitive artist is always apt to  feel as if he had been dried over a barrel.    Besides, last night there had been a supper party after the  performance at the flat which the comedian of the troupe had rented  in Jermyn Street, a forced, rowdy supper party where a number of  tired people with over-strained nerves had seemed to feel it a duty  to be artificially vivacious. It had lasted till four o'clock when  the morning papers with the notices arrived, and George had not got  to bed till four-thirty. These things colour the mental outlook.    Mac reappeared.    \"Here you are, sir.\"    \"Thanks.\"    George put the telegrams in his pocket. A cat, on its way back from  lunch, paused beside him in order to use his leg as a serviette.  George tickled it under the ear abstractedly. He was always  courteous to cats, but today he went through the movements  perfunctorily and without enthusiasm.    The cat moved on. Mac became conversational.    \"They tell me the piece was a hit last night, sir.\"    \"It seemed to go very well.\"    \"My Missus saw it from the gallery, and all the first-nighters was  speaking very 'ighly of it. There's a regular click, you know, sir,  over here in London, that goes to all the first nights in the  gallery. 'Ighly critical they are always. Specially if it's an  American piece like this one. If they don't like it, they precious  soon let you know. My missus ses they was all speakin' very 'ighly  of it. My missus says she ain't seen a livelier show for a long  time, and she's a great theatregoer. My missus says they was all  specially pleased with the music.\"    \"That's good.\"    \"The Morning Leader give it a fine write-up. How was the rest of  the papers?\"    \"Splendid, all of them. I haven't seen the evening papers yet. I  came out to get them.\"    Mac looked down the street.    \"There'll be a rehearsal this afternoon, I suppose, sir? Here's  Miss Dore coming along.\"    George followed his glance. A tall girl in a tailor-made suit of  blue was coming towards them. Even at a distance one caught the  genial personality of the new arrival. It seemed to go before her  like a heartening breeze. She picked her way carefully through the  children crawling on the side walk. She stopped for a moment and  said something to one of them. The child grinned. Even the  proprietor of the grocery store appeared to brighten up at the  sight of her, as at the sight of some old friend.    \"How's business, Bill?\" she called to him as she passed the spot  where he stood brooding on the mortality of tomatoes. And, though  he replied \"Rotten\", a faint, grim smile did nevertheless flicker  across his tragic mask.    Billie Dore, who was one of the chorus of George Bevan's musical  comedy, had an attractive face, a mouth that laughed readily,  rather bright golden hair (which, she was fond of insisting with  perfect truth, was genuine though appearances were against it), and  steady blue eyes. The latter were frequently employed by her in  quelling admirers who were encouraged by the former to become too  ardent. Billie's views on the opposite sex who forgot themselves  were as rigid as those of Lord Marshmoreton concerning thrips. She  liked men, and she would signify this liking in a practical manner  by lunching and dining with them, but she was entirely  self-supporting, and when men overlooked that fact she reminded  them of it in no uncertain voice; for she was a girl of ready speech  and direct.    \"'Morning, George. 'Morning, Mac. Any mail?\"    \"I'll see, miss.\"    \"How did your better four-fifths like the show, Mac?\"    \"I was just telling Mr. Bevan, miss, that the missus said she  'adn't seen a livelier show for a long time.\"    \"Fine. I knew I'd be a hit. Well, George, how's the boy this bright  afternoon?\"    \"Limp and pessimistic.\"    \"That comes of sitting up till four in the morning with festive  hams.\"    \"You were up as late as I was, and you look like Little Eva after a  night of sweet, childish slumber.\"    \"Yes, but I drank ginger ale, and didn't smoke eighteen cigars. And  yet, I don't know. I think I must be getting old, George. All-night  parties seem to have lost their charm. I was ready to quit at one  o'clock, but it didn't seem matey. I think I'll marry a farmer and  settle down.\"    George was amazed. He had not expected to find his present view of  life shared in this quarter.    \"I was just thinking myself,\" he said, feeling not for the first  time how different Billie was from the majority of those with whom  his profession brought him in contact, \"how flat it all was. The  show business I mean, and these darned first nights, and the party  after the show which you can't sidestep. Something tells me I'm  about through.\"    Billie Dore nodded.    \"Anybody with any sense is always about through with the show  business. I know I am. If you think I'm wedded to my art, let me  tell you I'm going to get a divorce the first chance that comes  along. It's funny about the show business. The way one drifts into  it and sticks, I mean. Take me, for example. Nature had it all  doped out for me to be the Belle of Hicks Corners. What I ought to  have done was to buy a gingham bonnet and milk cows. But I would  come to the great city and help brighten up the tired business  man.\"    \"I didn't know you were fond of the country, Billie.\"    \"Me? I wrote the words and music. Didn't you know I was a country  kid? My dad ran a Bide a Wee Home for flowers, and I used to know  them all by their middle names. He was a nursery gardener out in  Indiana. I tell you, when I see a rose nowadays, I shake its hand  and say: 'Well, well, Cyril, how's everything with you? And how are  Joe and Jack and Jimmy and all the rest of the boys at home?' Do  you know how I used to put in my time the first few nights I was  over here in London? I used to hang around Covent Garden with my  head back, sniffing. The boys that mess about with the flowers  there used to stub their toes on me so often that they got to look  on me as part of the scenery.\"    \"That's where we ought to have been last night.\"    \"We'd have had a better time. Say, George, did you see the awful  mistake on Nature's part that Babe Sinclair showed up with towards  the middle of the proceedings? You must have noticed him, because  he took up more room than any one man was entitled to. His name was  Spenser Gray.\"    George recalled having been introduced to a fat man of his own age  who answered to that name.    \"It's a darned shame,\" said Billie indignantly. \"Babe is only a  kid. This is the first show she's been in. And I happen to know  there's an awfully nice boy over in New York crazy to marry her.  And I'm certain this gink is giving her a raw deal. He tried to  get hold of me about a week ago, but I turned him down hard; and I  suppose he thinks Babe is easier. And it's no good talking to her;  she thinks he's wonderful. That's another kick I have against the  show business. It seems to make girls such darned chumps. Well, I  wonder how much longer Mr. Arbuckle is going to be retrieving my  mail. What ho, within there, Fatty!\"    Mac came out, apologetic, carrying letters.    \"Sorry, miss. By an oversight I put you among the G's.\"    \"All's well that ends well. 'Put me among the G's.' There's a good  title for a song for you, George. Excuse me while I grapple with  the correspondence. I'll bet half of these are mash notes. I got  three between the first and second acts last night. Why the  nobility and gentry of this burg should think that I'm their  affinity just because I've got golden hair--which is perfectly  genuine, Mac; I can show you the pedigree--and because I earn an  honest living singing off the key, is more than I can understand.\"    Mac leaned his massive shoulders comfortably against the building,  and resumed his chat.    \"I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?\"    George pondered. He was certainly feeling better since he had seen  Billie Dore, but he was far from being himself.    \"I ought to be, I suppose. But I'm not.\"    \"Ah, you're getting blarzy, sir, that's what it is. You've 'ad too  much of the fat, you 'ave. This piece was a big 'it in America,  wasn't it?\"    \"Yes. It ran over a year in New York, and there are three companies  of it out now.\"    \"That's 'ow it is, you see. You've gone and got blarzy. Too big a  'elping of success, you've 'ad.\" Mac wagged a head like a harvest  moon. \"You aren't a married man, are you, sir?\"    Billie Dore finished skimming through her mail, and crumpled the  letters up into a large ball, which she handed to Mac.    \"Here's something for you to read in your spare moments, Mac.  Glance through them any time you have a suspicion you may be a  chump, and you'll have the comfort of knowing that there are  others. What were you saying about being married?\"    \"Mr. Bevan and I was 'aving a talk about 'im being blarzy, miss.\"    \"Are you blarzy, George?\"    \"So Mac says.\"    \"And why is he blarzy, miss?\" demanded Mac rhetorically.    \"Don't ask me,\" said Billie. \"It's not my fault.\"    \"It's because, as I was saying, 'e's 'ad too big a 'elping of  success, and because 'e ain't a married man. You did say you wasn't  a married man, didn't you, sir?\"    \"I didn't. But I'm not.\"    \"That's 'ow it is, you see. You pretty soon gets sick of pulling  off good things, if you ain't got nobody to pat you on the back for  doing of it. Why, when I was single, if I got 'old of a sure thing  for the three o'clock race and picked up a couple of quid, the  thrill of it didn't seem to linger somehow. But now, if some of the  gentlemen that come 'ere "]]]
