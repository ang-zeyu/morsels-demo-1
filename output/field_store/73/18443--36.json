The same  is true of the eleven kinds of hickory, the six kinds of ash, etc.,  etc.    The list of names of all trees indigenous to the United States, as  enumerated by the United States Forest Service, is 495 in number, the  designation of \"tree\" being applied to all woody plants which produce  naturally in their native habitat one main, erect stem, bearing a  definite crown, no matter what size they attain.    Timber is produced only by the Spermatophyta, or seed-bearing plants,  which are subdivided into the Gymnosperms (conifers), and Angiosperms  (broad-leaved). The conifer or cone-bearing tree, to which belong the  pines, larches, and firs, is one of the three natural orders of  Gymnosperms. These are generally classed as \"softwoods,\" and are more  extensively scattered and more generally used than any other class of  timber, and are simple and regular in structure. The so-called  \"hardwoods\" are \"Dicotyledons\" or broad-leaved trees, a subdivision of  the Angiosperms. They are generally of slower growth, and produce  harder timber than the conifers, but not necessarily so. Basswood,  poplar, sycamore, and some of the gums, though classed with the  hardwoods, are not nearly as hard as some of the pines.                                        SECTION II                               CONIFEROUS TREES                         WOOD OF THE CONIFEROUS TREES      Examining a smooth cross-section or end face of a well-grown log of  Georgia pine, we distinguish an envelope of reddish, scaly bark, a  small, whitish pith at the center, and between these the wood in a  great number of concentric rings.                                   Bark and Pith    The bark of a pine stem is thickest and roughest near the base,  decreases rapidly in thickness from one to one-half inches at the  stump to one-tenth inch near the top of the tree, and forms in general  about ten to fifteen per cent of the entire trunk. The pith is quite  thick, usually one-eighth to one-fifth inch in southern species,  though much less so in white pine, and is very thin, one-fifteenth to  one twenty-fifth inch in cypress, cedar, and larch.    In woods with a thick pith, the pith is finest at the stump, grows  rapidly thicker toward the top, and becomes thinner again in the crown  and limbs, the first one to five rings adjoining it behaving  similarly.    What is called the pith was once the seedling tree, and in many of the  pines and firs, especially after they have been seasoning for a good  while, this is distinctly noticeable in the center of the log, and  detaches itself from the surrounding wood.                                 Sap and Heartwood    Wood is composed of duramen or heartwood, and alburnum or sapwood, and  when dry consists approximately of 49 per cent by weight of carbon, 6  per cent of hydrogen, 44 per cent of oxygen, and 1 per cent of ash,  which is fairly uniform for all species. The sapwood is the external  and youngest portion of the tree, and often constitutes a very  considerable proportion of it. It lies next the bark, and after a  course of years, sometimes many, as in the case of oaks, sometimes  few, as in the case of firs, it becomes hardened and ultimately forms  the duramen or heartwood. Sapwood is generally of a white or light  color, almost invariably lighter in color than the heartwood, and is  very conspicuous in the darker-colored woods, as for instance the  yellow sapwood of mahogany and similiar colored woods, and the reddish  brown heartwood; or the yellow sapwood of _Lignum-vitae_ and the dark  green heartwood. Sapwood forms a much larger proportion of some trees  than others, but being on the outer circumference it always forms a  large proportion of the timber, and even in sound, hard pine will be  from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the tree and in some cases much  more. It is really imperfect wood, while the duramen or heartwood is  the perfect wood; the heartwood of the mature tree was the sapwood of  its earlier years. Young trees when cut down are almost all sapwood,  and practically useless as good, sound timber; it is, however, through  the sapwood that the life-giving juices which sustain the tree arise  from the soil, and if the sapwood be cut through, as is done when  \"girdling,\" the tree quickly dies, as it can derive no further  nourishment from the soil. Although absolutely necessary to the  growing tree, sapwood is often objectionable to the user, as it is the  first part to decay. In this sapwood many cells are active, store up  starch, and otherwise assist in the life processes of the tree,  although only the last or outer layer of cells forms the growing part,  and the true life of the tree.    The duramen or heartwood is the inner, darker part of the log. In the  heartwood all the cells are lifeless cases, and serve only the  mechanical function of keeping the tree from breaking under its own  great weight or from being laid low by the winds. The darker color of  the heartwood is due to infiltration of chemical substances into the  cell walls, but the cavities of the cells in pine are not filled up,  as is sometimes believed, nor do their walls grow thicker, nor are the  walls any more liquified than in the sapwood.    Sapwood varies in width and in the number of rings which it contains  even in different parts of the same tree. The same year's growth which  is sapwood in one part of a disk may be heartwood in another. Sapwood  is widest in the main part of the stem and often varies within  considerable limits and without apparent regularity. Generally, it  becomes narrower toward the top and in the limbs, its width varying  with the diameter, and being the least in a given disk on the side  which has the shortest radius. Sapwood of old and stunted pines is  composed of more rings than that of young and thrifty specimens. Thus  in a pine two hundred and fifty years old a layer of wood or an annual  ring does not change from sapwood to heartwood until seventy or eighty  years after it is formed, while in a tree one hundred years old or  less it remains sapwood only from thirty to sixty years.    The width of the sapwood varies considerably for different kinds of  pine. It is small for long-leaf and white pine and great for loblolly  and Norway pines. Occupying the peripheral part of the trunk, the  proportion which it forms of the entire mass of the stem is always  great. Thus even in old long-leaf pines, the sapwood forms 40 per cent  of the merchantable log, while in the loblolly and in all young trees  the sapwood forms the bulk of the wood.                            The Annual or Yearly Rings    The concentric annual or yearly rings which appear on the end face of  a log are cross-sections of so many thin layers of wood. Each such  layer forms an envelope around its inner neighbor, and is in turn  covered by the adjoining layer without, so that the whole stem is  built up of a series of thin, hollow cylinders, or rather cones.    A new layer of wood is formed each season, covering the entire stem,  as well as all the living branches. The thickness of this layer or the  width of the yearly ring varies greatly in different trees, and also  in different parts of the same tree.    In a normally-grown, thrifty pine log the rings are widest near the  pith, growing more and more narrow toward the bark. Thus the central  twenty rings in a disk of an old long-leaf pine may each be one-eighth  to one-sixth inch wide, while the twenty rings next to the bark may  average only one-thirtieth inch.    In our forest trees, rings of one-half inch in width occur only near  the center in disks of very thrifty trees, of both conifers and  hardwoods. One-twelfth inch represents good, thrifty growth, and the  minimum width of one two hundred inch is often seen in stunted spruce  and pine. The average width of rings in well-grown, old white pine  will vary from one-twelfth to one-eighteenth inch, while in the slower  growing long-leaf pine it may be one twenty-fifth to one-thirtieth of  an inch. The same layer of wood is widest near the stump in very  thrifty young trees, especially if grown in the open park; but in old  forest trees the same year's growth is wider at the upper part of the  tree, being narrowest near the stump, and often also near the very tip  of the stem. Generally the rings are widest near the center, growing  narrower toward the bark.    In logs from stunted trees the order is often reversed, the interior  rings being thin and the outer rings widest. Frequently, too, zones or  bands of very narrow rings, representing unfavorable periods of  growth, disturb the general regularity.    Few trees, even among pines, furnish a log with truly circular  cross-section. Usually it is an oval, and at the stump commonly quite  an irregular figure. Moreover, even in very regular or circular disks  the pith is rarely in the center, and frequently one radius is  conspicuously longer than its opposite, the width of some rings, if  not all, being greater on one side than on the other. This is nearly  always so in the limbs, the lower radius exceeding the upper. In  extreme cases, especially in the limbs, a ring is frequently  conspicuous on one side, and almost or entirely lost to view on the  other. Where the rings are extremely narrow, the dark portion of the  ring is often wanting, the color being quite uniform and light. The  greater regularity or irregularity of the annual rings has much to do  with the technical qualities of the timber.                              Spring- and Summer-Wood    Examining the rings more closely, it is noticed that each ring is made  up of an inner, softer, light-colored and an outer, or peripheral,  firmer and darker-colored portion. Being formed in the forepart of the  season, the inner, light-colored part is termed spring-wood, the  outer, darker-portioned being the summer-wood of the ring. Since the  latter is very heavy and firm it determines to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26600"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 1, March 1906 (#4)"],[1,"breasts  demanding to be heard, to be satisfied.    The French novelist, Jean Reibrach, in one of his novels, \"New Beauty,\"  attempts to picture the ideal, beautiful, emancipated woman. This ideal  is embodied in a young girl, a physician. She talks very clearly and  wisely of how to feed infants, she is kind and administers medicines  free to poor mothers. She converses with a young man of her acquaintance  about the sanitary conditions of the future and how various bacilli and  germs shall be exterminated by the use of stone walls and floors, and  the doing away of rugs and hangings. She is, of course, very plainly and  practically dressed, mostly in black. The young man, who, at their first  meeting was overawed by the wisdom of his emancipated friend, gradually  learns to understand her, and recognizes one fine day that he loves her.  They are young and she is kind and beautiful, and though always in rigid  attire, her appearance is softened by spotlessly clean white collar and  cuffs. One would expect that he would tell her of his love, but he is  not one to commit romantic absurdities. Poetry and the enthusiasm of  love cover their blushing faces before the pure beauty of the lady. He  silences the voice of his nature and remains correct. She, too, is  always exact, always rational, always well behaved. I fear if they had  formed a union, the young man would have risked freezing to death. I  must confess that I can see nothing beautiful in this new beauty, who is  as cold as the stone walls and floors she dreams of. Rather would I have  the love songs of romantic ages, rather Don Juan and Madame Venus,  rather an elopement by ladder and rope on a moonlight night, followed by  a father's curse, mother's moans, and the moral comments of neighbors,  than correctness and propriety measured by yardsticks. If love does not  know how to give and take without restriction it is not love, but a  transaction that never fails to lay stress on a plus and a minus.    The greatest shortcoming of the emancipation of the present day lies in  its artificial stiffness and its narrow respectabilities which produce  an emptiness in woman's soul that will not let her drink from the  fountain of life. I once remarked that there seemed to be a deeper  relationship between the old-fashioned mother and hostess, ever on the  alert for the happiness of her little ones and the comfort of those she  loved and the truly new woman, than between the latter and her average  emancipated sister. The disciples of emancipation pure and simple  declared me heathen, merely fit for the stake. Their blind zeal did not  let them see that my comparison between the old and the new was merely  to prove that a goodly number of our grandmothers had more blood in  their veins, far more humor and wit, and certainly a greater amount of  naturalness, kind-heartedness and simplicity than the majority of our  emancipated professional women who fill our colleges, halls of learning,  and various offices. This does not mean a wish to return to the past,  nor does it condemn woman to her old sphere, the kitchen and the  nursery.    Salvation lies in an energetic march onward towards a brighter and  clearer future. We are in need of unhampered growth out of old  traditions and habits. The movement for woman's emancipation has so far  made but the first step in that direction. It is to be hoped that it  will gather strength to make another. The right to vote, equal civil  rights, are all very good demands, but true emancipation begins neither  at the polls nor in courts. It begins in woman's soul. History tells us  that every oppressed class gained its true liberation from its masters  through its own efforts. It is necessary that woman learn that lesson,  that she realize that her freedom will reach as far as her power to  achieve her freedom reaches. It is therefore far more important for her  to begin with her inner regeneration, to cut loose from the weight of  prejudices, traditions, and customs. The demand for various equal rights  in every vocation in life is just and fair, but, after all, the most  vital right is the right to love and be loved. Indeed if the partial  emancipation is to become a complete and true emancipation of woman, it  will have to do away with the ridiculous notion that to be loved, to be  sweetheart and mother, is synonomous with being slave or subordinate.  It will have to do away with the absurd notion of the dualism of the  sexes, or that man and woman represent two antagonistic worlds.    Pettiness separates, breadth unites. Let us be broad and big. Let us not  overlook vital things, because of the bulk of trifles confronting us. A  true conception of the relation of the sexes will not admit of conqueror  and conquered; it knows of but one great thing: to give of one's self  boundlessly in order to find oneself richer, deeper, better. That alone  can fill the emptiness and replace the tragedy of woman's emancipation  with joy, limitless joy.    [Illustration]          TRY LOVE    By GRACE POTTER      In the human heart it lies. The key to happiness Men call the key love.  In the sweet time of youth, every man and every maid knows where lies  the key that will unlock happiness. Sometimes, they, laughing, hold the  key in eager, willing hands and will not put it in the door for very  bliss and waiting. Just outside they laugh and play and blow wild kisses  to the world. The whole world of men and women, who in their youth found  happiness in just that way, is gathered round to see it found again.    When at last the man and maid unlock the door and go in joy to find  their happiness, the men and women who have been watching them bury  their faces in their hands and weep. Why do they weep? Because they are  thinking that soon other doors in life will be met by this man and maid  and that there will be no keys to unlock them. They, themselves, could  find no key.    They never thought of trying the key of love in all the doors of life.  Long and wearily, eyes searching wide, hands eagerly groping, they have  spent their time trying to find other keys. They have looked for and  found knowledge. And tried that. Looked for and found fame. And tried  that. Looked for and found wealth. And tried that. Looked for and found  many, many other keys. And tried them all. And when at last they have  lain down on their deathbeds, they have turned gray hopeless faces to  the world and died saying, \"We could not find the right key.\"    Some few, some very few, there are, who try the key of love in all  life's doors. Radiant, they turn to the men and women about and cry,  \"Try love! It unlocks all other doors as surely as it does the first in  life. Try love!\"    And though their fellow beings see that these are the only ones in all  the world who find happiness, they turn doubting from them. \"It cannot  be,\" they say, \"that the key we used in youth should be used again in  all the other doors of life.\" And so they keep on trying the keys that  every disappointed, dying man calls out in warning voice will fail.    Only a few there are who learn--a very few--that love unlocks all other  doors in life as surely as it does the first. Try love!    [Illustration]    +Japan.+--A new civilization. The land of a new culture! was the cry of  every penny-a-liner at the time when she began to display her  battleships, cannon, and her accomplished method of drilling her  soldiers. They were mocking themselves and did not know how. They talk  of culture and civilization and their criterion thereof is the  development of the technique of murder. Again, Japan a modern state. She  can take her place in the ranks of other civilized countries. Rejoice!  and then learn that victorious Japan is on the threshold of a famine.  Nearly a million people, it is laconically reported, are in danger of  dying of starvation. Surely, no one will possibly doubt now that Japan  is a civilized country.          WITHOUT GOVERNMENT    By MAX BAGINSKI      The gist of the anarchistic idea is this, that there are qualities  present in man, which permit the possibilities of social life,  organization, and co-operative work without the application of force.  Such qualities are solidarity, common action, and love of justice.  To-day they are either crippled or made ineffective through the  influence of compulsion; they can hardly be fully unfolded in a society  in which groups, classes, and individuals are placed in hostile,  irreconcilable opposition to one another. In human nature to-day such  traits are fostered and developed which separate instead of combining,  call forth hatred instead of a common feeling, destroy the humane  instead of building it up. The cultivation of these traits could not be  so successful if it did not find the best nourishment in the foundations  and institutions of the present social order.    On close inspection of these institutions, which are based upon the  power of the State that maintains them, mankind shows itself as a huge  menagerie, in which the captive beasts seek to tear the morsels from  each other's greedy jaws. The sharpest teeth, the strongest claws and  paws vanquish the weaker competitors. Malice and underhand dealing are  victorious over frankness and confidence. The struggle for the means of  existence and for the maintenance of achieved power fill the entire  space of the menagerie with an infernal noise. Among the methods which  are used to secure this organized bestiality the most prominent ones are  the hangman, the judge with his mechanical: \"In the name of the king,\"  or his more hypocritical: \"In the name of the people I pass sentence\";  the soldier with his training for murder, and the priest with his:  \"Authority comes from God.\"    The exteriors of prisons, armories, and churches show that they are  institutions in which the body and soul are subdued. He whose thoughts  reach beyond this philosophy of the menagerie sees in"]]]
