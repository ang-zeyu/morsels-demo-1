This system is still followed  to a certain extent; for, fifteen years ago, when I was in one of the  Greek islands, a German came round the town selling birds mounted in  the same way, and also mounted feather by feather.    To quote now from the translation of a French work, published by  Longman, Rees, and Co, in London, in 1820, we find that \"A work  appeared at Lyons in 1758, entitled 'Instructions on the Manner of  Collecting and Preparing the Different Curiosities of Natural  History.'\" [Footnote: The sixth edition, twenty-three years later, has  this title, \"Taxidermy, or the Art of Preparing and Mounting Objects  of Natural History for the use of Museums and Travellers, by Mrs. R.  Lee, formerly Mrs. J. Edward Bowdich. Sixth edition, 1843. Longman,  Brown, Green, and Longman.\"]    The author was the first who submitted some useful principles for  taxidermy. He ornamented his book with many plates, more than half of  which are in all respects foreign to his subject, as they simply  represent shells, and other marine productions, with their  descriptions.    In 1786, the Abbe Manesse published a volume under the title of  \"Treatise on the Manner of Stuffing and Preserving Animals and Skins.\"  He presented his work to the Academy, who made a favourable report of  it.    Mauduyt has given a memoir on the manner of preparing dead birds for  forming collections. (See la 5eme \"Livraison de l'Encyclopedie,  Methodique, Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux,\" t. i, deuxieme partie, p.  435.) By studying his method we may, with perseverance, be able to  mount birds well, although he had never prepared them himself, for he  has composed his memoir from the notes which Lerot furnished him, who  mounted them very well, and who merited the confidence which Mauduyt  had accorded him in all the preparations which his fine collection  required.    An old sculptor, living at Lahaye, devoted himself to the practice of  taxidermy, and in a short time surpassed all those who had employed  themselves in mounting animals, especially large mammalia.    It seems that neither the English nor the Dutch have published any  work which treats of the method of mounting animals according to  system.    In 1801 we were not more advanced than they were. What we possessed of  this kind appeared insufficient to amateurs. Notwithstanding, many  derived advantage from the memoir of Mauduyt, but being inserted in  the \"Encyclopedie Methodique,\" it was not always easy to procure it.  There was, besides, only the work of Abbe Manesse, and the tediousness  of the means which he pointed out frightened all those who desired to  learn taxidermy. The professors of natural history to the central  schools of the departments felt more than ever the want of a work  which furnished the method of preserving and augmenting their  zoological collections. In 1802 their wishes were nearly accomplished,  for there appeared almost at the same time two works on taxidermy, the  one by M. Nicholas, a chemist, the other by M. Henon. M. Nicholas  makes an analysis of all that had been said before on the preparation  of animals. This view comprehends nearly half the volume.    Becoeur, of Metz, was the best apothecary in that city. He mounted  fresh birds in the greatest perfection, and by a little practice one  is sure to succeed with his method. He opened his birds in the usual  manner, that is to say, by the middle of the belly. He easily took out  the body by this opening without cutting any of the extremities; he  then removed the flesh by the aid of a scalpel, taking the precaution  to preserve all the ligaments; he anointed the skin, and put the  skeleton in its place, carefully dispersing the feathers on each side.  He ran the head through with an iron wire, in which he had formed a  little ring at nearly the third of its length; the smallest side  passed into the rump in such a manner that 'the ring of the iron wire  was under the sternum. He then passed a wire into each claw, so that  the extremities of the wire united to pass into the little ring; he  bent these extremities within, and fixed them with a string to the  iron in the middle of the vertebral column. He replaced the flesh by  flax, or chopped cotton, sewed up the bird, placed it on a foot or  support of wood, and gave it a suitable attitude, of which he was  always sure--for a bird thus mounted could only bend in its natural  posture (?). He prepared quadrupeds in the same manner.    It remains for us to speak of a little work published by Henon and  Mouton Fontenelle. They had at first no other object than to read  their manuscript to the Athenaeum at Lyons, of which they were  members. They were earnestly solicited to print it, and published it  in 1802. The authors speak of birds only. They describe an infinity of  methods practised by others, and compare them to their own, which,  without doubt, are preferable, but too slow to satisfy the impatience  of ornithologists.    The book from which I have just quoted seems to have been the only  reliable text book known at that period, and with the exception of  certain modern improvements in modelling and mounting, contains a mass  of--for that day--valuable elementary information. In fact, the French  and German taxidermists were then far in advance of us, a stigma which  we did not succeed in wiping off until after the Great Exhibition of  1851.    Although, as I have just said, the French and Germans excelled us in  the setting up of specimens, yet their collections did not, in all  cases, exceed ours in point of interest or magnitude, for the old  taxidermists had been at work prior to 1725, at which date it is  recorded that the museum of Sir Hans Sloane (the nucleus of our  British Museum collection) contained the following number of  specimens: Mammals, 1194; birds, 753; reptiles, 345; fishes, 1007. A  gradual increase appeared by 1753, when the figures stood: Mammals,  1886; birds, 1172; reptiles, 521; fishes, 1555. A great proportion of  these were, however, not stuffed specimens, but simply bones and  preparations of fleshy parts in spirits. Nothing shows the gradual  rise and progress of taxidermy better than the history of the British  Museum, which, under the then name of Montagu House, was opened to the  public by special ticket on Jan. 15, 1759.    Soon after its opening the natural history collections appear to have  claimed more interest from the public, for in 1765 we had a very good  collection of butterflies, and in 1769 the trustees acquired, by  purchase, a considerable collection of stuffed birds from Holland. The  restrictions on visitors were, however, vexatious, people of all  classes being hurried through the rooms at a tremendous speed--vide  Hutton, the Birmingham historian, who visited it in 1784, and relates  how he would fain have spent hours looking at things for which only  minutes were allowed. From this period up to 1816 (at which date the  valuable ornithological collection of Col. Montagu was purchased for  the nation at a cost of L11,000) the additions to the natural history  galleries were not many, probably owing to the troublous times;  however, when we had succeeded in breaking the power of Napoleon and  restored peace to Europe, naturalists and taxidermists found that the  public had then time and inclination to devote themselves to their  collections or works.    Accordingly, during the next twenty years many works (including those  before noted) were written on taxidermy, the most notable being by  Swainson, Brown, and that eccentric genius Waterton, whom we may call  the pioneer of our present system of mounting, and who, in his usual  caustic style, pointed out the very inferior way in which specimens  were then mounted.    At the end of his \"Wanderings in South America\" appeared a treatise on  Taxidermy, but, as he decried the use of arsenical preparations, and  mounted his birds without wires in a fashion peculiar to himself, his  system did not find favour in the eyes of the school of rigid  stuffing, who had not then worked out the present happy compromise  between his style and theirs. His patience must have been  inexhaustible; indeed, the Rev. J. G. Wood, who knew him well, has  told me of many instances in which he spent days in scraping out the  hands and feet of the larger apes until he got them as thin as paper,  and also of his delight when he invented the kid-glove substitute for  a peacock's face much to the astonishment of the reverend gentleman.  Of course; all these works on the preservation of natural history  objects and the labours of collectors directed the public mind to the  contemplation of natural history.    The British Museum at this time also--relieved of a few of the  restrictions on admission--became more popular, and in 1836 we find  the natural history collections were as follow: Mammals, species 405;  birds, species 2400; constituting altogether in specimens the sum  total of 4659. Of reptiles we could boast--species 600, specimens  1300; fish 1000 specimens. These figures did not contrast favourably  with the Paris Museum as in the days of old for now Paris stood:  Mammals, species 500; birds, species 2300; grand total of specimens  6000. Of fish the French had four times as many as we (and beat us,  proportionately, in other sections), while we were far in advance in  this class of the Vienna and Berlin Museums. In shells (not fossils),  London and Paris were equal and much superior to Berlin and Leyden. In  1848 an extraordinary increase (marking the great interest taken in  taxidermical science) had taken place; we now had added to the British  Museum since 1836, 29,595 specimens, comprising 5797 mammals, 13,414  birds, 4112 reptiles, 6272 fish.    In mammals and birds we held the proud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#4)"],[1," he would like to claim is  that he should be able to write a really good handbook on the  subject, wherein such topographical, historical, and economic  information as was presented should have the stamp of correctness.  Perhaps four years of pretty constant automobile touring in Europe  ought to count for something in the way of accumulated pertinent  information concerning hotels and highways and by-ways.    Not all automobilists are millionaires. The man of moderate means is  the real giver of impetus to the wheels of automobile progress. The  manufacturers of motor-cars have not wholly waked up to this fact as  yet, but the increasing number of tourists in small cars, both in  England and in France, points to the fact that something besides the  forty, sixty, or hundred horse-power monsters are being manufactured.    Efficiency and reliability is the great requisite of the touring  automobile, and, for that matter, should be of any other. Efficiency  and reliability cover ninety-nine per cent. of the requirements of  the automobilist. Chance will step in at the most inopportune moments  and upset all calculations, but, with due regard given to these two  great and fundamental principles, the rest does not much matter.    It is a curious fact that the great mass of town folk, in France and  probably elsewhere, still have a fear and dread of the mechanism of  the automobile. \"_C'est beau la mecanique, mais c'est tout de meme un  peu complique_,\" they say, as they regard your labours in posing a  new valve or tightening up a joint here and there.    The development of the automobile has brought about a whole new  development of kindred things, as did the development of the  battle-ship. First there was the battle-ship, then the cruiser, and  then the torpedo-boat, and then another class of boats, the  destroyers (destined to catch torpedo-boats), and finally the  submarine. With the automobile the evolution was much the same; first  it was a sort of horseless carriage, for town use, then something a  little more powerful that would climb hills, so that one might  journey afield, and then the \"touring-car,\" and then the racing  machine, and now we have automobile omnibuses, and even automobile  ambulances to pick up any frightened persons possessed of less  agility than a kangaroo or a jack-rabbit might inadvertently have  been bowled over. These disasters are seldom the automobilist's  fault, and, happily, they are becoming fewer and fewer; but the  indecision that overcame the passer-by, in the early days of the  bicycle, still exists with many whenever an automobile comes in  sight, and they back, and fill, and worry the automobilist into such  a bad case of nerves that, in spite of himself, something of the  nature of an accident, for which he is in no way responsible, really  does happen.    Once the writer made eleven hundred kilometres straight across  France, from the Manche to the Mediterranean, and not so much as a  puncture occurred. On another occasion a little journey of half the  length resulted in the general smashing up, four times in succession,  of a little bolt (no great disaster in itself), within the interior  arrangements of the motor, which necessitated a half a day's work on  each occasion in taking down the cylinder and setting it up again,  and each time in a small town far away from any properly equipped  machine-shop, and with the assistance only of the local locksmith.  It's astonishing how good a job a locksmith in France can do, even on  an automobile, the mechanism of which he perhaps has never seen  before. Officially the locksmith in France is known as a _serrurier_,  but in the slang of the land he is the _cambrioleur du pays_, a name  which is expressive, but which means nothing wicked. He can put a  thread on a bolt or make a new nut to replace one that has  mysteriously unscrewed itself, which is more than many a mere bicycle  repairer can do.    The automobilist touring France should make friends with the nearest  _cambrioleur_ if he is in trouble. In England this is risky, a  \"gas-pipe thread\" being the average lay workman's idea of \"fixing you  up.\"    Away back in Chaucer's day folk were \"longen to gon on pilgrimages,\"  and it does not matter in the least what the ways and means may be,  the motive is ever the same: a change of scene.    This book is no unbounded eulogy of the automobile, although its many  good qualities are recognized. There are other methods of travel  that, in their own ways, are certainly enjoyable, but none quite  equal the automobile for independence of action, convenience, and  efficiency. It is well for all motor-car users, however, to realize  that they are not the only road users, and to have a due regard for  others,--not only their rights, but their persons. This applies even  more forcibly, if possible, to the automobilist _en tour_.    One must in duty bound regulate his pace and his actions by the  vagaries of others, however little he may want to, or unfortunate  consequences will many times follow. Always he must have a sharp look  ahead and must not neglect a backward glance now and then. He must  not dash through muddy roads and splash passers-by (a particularly  heinous offence in England), and in France he must observe the rule  of the road (always to the right in passing,--no great difficulty for  an American, but very puzzling to an Englishman), or an accident may  result which will bring him into court, and perhaps into jail, unless  he can assuage the poor peasant's feelings for the damaged forelegs  of his horse or donkey by a cash payment on the spot.    Maeterlinck's \"wonderful, unknown beast\" is still unknown (and  feared) by the majority of outsiders, and the propaganda of education  must go on for a long time yet. Maeterlinck's great tribute to the  automobile is his regard for it as the conqueror of space. Never  before has the individual man been able to accomplish what the  soulless corporations have with railway trains. In steamboat or train  we are but a part and parcel of the freight carried, but in the  automobile we are stoker, driver, and passenger in one, and regard  every road-turning and landmark with a new wonder and appreciation.    We are the aristocrats of tourists, and we are bound therefore to  have a kindly regard for other road users or a revolution will spring  up, as it did in feudal times.    Take Maeterlinck's wise sayings for your guide, and be tolerant of  the rights of others. This will do automobilism more good than can be  measured, for it has come to stay, and perhaps even advance. The days  of the horse are numbered.    \"In accord with the needs of our insatiable, exacting soul, which  craves at once for the small and the mighty, the quick and the slow;  here it is of us at last, it is ours, and offers at every turn  glimpses of beauty that, in former days, we could only enjoy when the  tedious journey was ended.\"    The \"tour abroad\" has ever been the lodestone which has drawn  countless thousands of home-loving English and Americans to  Continental Europe. Pleasure--mere pleasure--has accounted for many  of these pilgrims, but by far the largest proportion have been those  who seek education and edification combined.    One likes to be well cared for when he journeys, whether by road or  rail, and demands accordingly, if not all the comforts of home, at  least many things that the native knows or cares little of. A  Frenchman does not desire a sitting-room, a reading-room, or a fire  in his sleeping-room, and, according to his lights, he is quite  right. He finds all this at a cafe, and prefers to go there for it.  The steam-heated hotel, with running water everywhere, is a rarity in  France, as indeed it is in England.    Outside Paris the writer has found this combination but seldom in  France; at Lyons, Marseilles, Moulins in the Allier, and at  Chatellerault in Poitou only. Modernity is making its way in France,  but only in spots; its progress is steady, but as yet it has not  penetrated into many outlying districts. Modern _art nouveau_ ideas  in France, which are banal enough, but which are an improvement over  the Eastlake and horsehair horrors of the Victorian and  Louis-Philippe periods, are tending to eliminate old-fashioned ideas  for the benefit of the traveller who would rather eat his meals in a  bright, airy apartment than in stuffy, dark hole known in England as  a coffee-room.    In France, in particular, the contrast of the new and old that one  occasionally meets with is staggering. It is all very well in its  way, this blending of antiquity and modernity, and gives one  something of the thrill of romance, which most of us have in our  make-up to a greater or lesser extent; but, on the other hand,  romance gets some hard knocks when one finds a Roman sarcophagus used  as a watering-trough; or a chapel as an automobile garage, as he  often will in the Midi.    One thing the American, and the Britisher to a lesser extent, be he  automobilist or mere tourist, must fully realize, and that is that  the tourist business is a more highly developed industry in  Continental Europe than it is anywhere else. In Switzerland one may  well say that it is a national industry, and in some parts of France  (always omitting Paris, which is not France) it is practically the  same thing; Holland and Belgium are not far behind, and neither is  the Rhine country; so that the tourist in Europe finds that creature  comforts are always near at hand. The automobilist does not much care  whether they are near at hand or not. If he doesn't find the  accommodations he is looking for on the borders of Dartmoor, he can  keep on to Exmoor, and if Nevers won't suit his purpose for the night  he can get to Moulins in an hour.    A hotel that is full and overflowing is no more a fear or a  dread; the automobilist simply takes the road again and drops  in on some market-town twenty, thirty, or fifty"]]]
