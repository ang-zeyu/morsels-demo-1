[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],[0,"The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#4)"],[1," eighth century B.C.    The writer of the books of Samuel takes it quite as a matter of course  that Michal, daughter of one royal Jahveh worshipper and wife of the  servant of Jahveh _par excellence,_ the pious David, should have her  teraphim handy, in her and David's chamber, when she dresses them up in  their bed into a simulation of her husband, for the purpose of deceiving  her father's messengers. Even one of the early prophets, Hosea, when  he threatens that the children of Israel shall abide many days without  \"ephod or teraphim\" (iii. 4), appears to regard both as equally proper  appurtenances of the suspended worship of Jahveh, and equally certain  to be restored when that is resumed. When we further take into  consideration that only in the reign of Hezekiah was the brazen serpent,  preserved in the temple and believed to be the work of Moses, destroyed,  and the practice of offering incense to it, that is, worshipping it,  abolished--that Jeroboam could set up \"calves of gold\" for Israel to  worship, with apparently none but a political object, and certainly with  no notion of creating a schism among the worshippers of Jahveh, or of  repelling the men of Judah from his standard--it seems obvious, either  that the Israelites of the tenth and eleventh centuries B.C. knew not  the second commandment, or that they construed it merely as part of the  prohibition to worship any supreme god other than Jahveh, which precedes  it.    In seeking for information about the teraphim, I lighted upon the  following passage in the valuable article on that subject by Archdeacon  Farrar, in Ritto's \"Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature,\" which is  so much to the purpose of my argument, that I venture to quote it in  full:--       The main and certain results of this review are that the     teraphim were rude human images; that the use of them was an     antique Aramaic custom; that there is reason to suppose them to     have been images of deceased ancestors; that they were consulted     oracularly; that they were not confined to Jews; that their use     continued down to the latest period of Jewish history;     and lastly, that although the enlightened prophets and strictest     later kings regarded them as idolatrous, the priests were much     less averse to such images, and their cult was not considered in     any way repugnant to the pious worship of Elohim, nay, even to     the worship of him \"under the awful title of Jehovah.\" In fact,     they involved _a monotheistic idolatry very different indeed     from polytheism;_ and the tolerance of them by priests, as     compared with the denunciation of them by the prophets, offers a     close analogy to the views of the Roman Catholics respecting     pictures and images as compared with the views of Protestants.     It was against this use of idolatrous symbols and emblems in a     monotheistic worship that the _second_ commandment was     directed, whereas the first is aimed against the graver sin of     direct polytheism. But the whole history of Israel shows how     utterly and how early the law must have fallen into desuetude.     The worship of the golden calf and of the calves at Dan and     Bethel, against which, so far as we know, neither Elijah nor     Elisha said a single word; the tolerance of high places,     teraphim and betylia; the offering of incense for centuries to     the brazen serpent destroyed by Hezekiah; the occasional     glimpses of the most startling irregularities sanctioned     apparently even in the temple worship itself, prove most     decisively that a pure monotheism and an independence of symbols     was the result of a slow and painful course of God's disciplinal     dealings among the noblest thinkers of a single nation, and not,     as is so constantly and erroneously urged, the instinct of the     whole Semitic race; in other words, one single branch of the     Semites was under God's providence _educated_ into pure     monotheism only by centuries of misfortune and series of     inspired men (vol. iii. p. 986).    It appears to me that the researches of the anthropologist lead him to  conclusions identical in substance, if not in terms, with those here  enunciated as the result of a careful study of the same subject from a  totally different point of view.    There is abundant evidence in the books of Samuel and elsewhere that  an article of dress termed an _ephod_ was supposed to have a peculiar  efficacy in enabling the wearer to exercise divination by means of  Jahveh-Elohim. Great and long continued have been the disputes as to the  exact nature of the ephod--whether it always means something to wear, or  whether it sometimes means an image. But the probabilities are that  it usually signifies a kind of waistcoat or broad zone, with  shoulder-straps, which the person who \"inquired of Jahveh\" put on. In  1 Samuel xxiii. 2 David appears to have inquired without an ephod, for  Abiathar the priest is said to have \"come down with an ephod in his  hand\" only subsequently. And then David asks for it before inquiring of  Jahveh whether the men of Keilah would betray him or not. David's action  is obviously divination pure and simple; and it is curious that he seems  to have worn the ephod himself and not to have employed Abiathar as a  medium. How the answer was given is not clear though the probability is  that it was obtained by casting lots. The _Urim_ and _Thummim_ seem to  have been two such lots of a peculiarly sacred character, which were  carried in the pocket of the high priest's \"breastplate.\" This last was  worn along with the ephod.    With the exception of one passage (1 Sam. xiv. 18) the ark is ignored in  the history of Saul. But in this place the Septuagint reads \"ephod\" for  ark, while in 1 Chronicles xiii. 3 David says that \"we sought not unto  it [the ark] in the days of Saul.\" Nor does Samuel seem to have paid  any regard to the ark after its return from Philistia; though, in his  childhood, he is said to have slept in \"the temple of Jahveh, where the  ark of Elohim was\" (1 Sam. iii. 3), at Shiloh and there to have been the  seer of the earliest apparitions vouchsafed to him by Jahveh. The  space between the cherubim or winged images on the canopy or cover  (_Kapporeth_) of this holy chest was held to be the special seat of  Jahveh--the place selected for a temporary residence of the Supreme  Elohim who had, after Aaron and Phineas, Eli and his sons for priests  and seers. And, when the ark was carried to the camp at Eben-ezer, there  can be no doubt that the Israelites, no less than the Philistines, held  that \"Elohim is come into the camp\" (iv. 7), and that the one, as much  as the other, conceived that the Israelites had summoned to their aid  a powerful ally in \"these (or this) mighty Elohim\"--elsewhere called  Jahve-Sabaoth, the Jahveh of Hosts. If the \"temple\" at Shiloh was  the pentateuchal tabernacle, as is suggested by the name of \"tent of  meeting\" given to it in 1 Samuel ii. 22, it was essentially a large  tent, though constituted of very expensive and ornate materials; if, on  the other hand, it was a different edifice, there can be little doubt  that this \"house of Jahveh\" was built on the model of an ordinary house  of the time. But there is not the slightest evidence that, during the  reign of Saul, any greater importance attached to this seat of the cult  of Jahveh than to others. Sanctuaries, and \"high places\" for sacrifice,  were scattered all over the country from Dan to Beersheba. And, as  Samuel is said to have gone up to one of these high places to bless the  sacrifice, it may be taken for tolerably certain that he knew nothing of  the Levitical laws which severely condemn the high places and those who  sacrifice away from the sanctuary hallowed by the presence of the ark.    There is no evidence that, during the time of the Judges and of Samuel,  any one occupied the position of the high priest of later days. And  persons who were neither priests nor Levites sacrificed and divined or  \"inquired of Jahveh,\" when they pleased and where they pleased, without  the least indication that they, or any one else in Israel at that  time, knew they were doing wrong. There is no allusion to any special  observance of the Sabbath; and the references to circumcision are  indirect.    Such are the chief articles of the theological creed of the old  Israelites, which are made known to us by the direct evidence of the  ancient record to which we have had recourse, and they are as remarkable  for that which they contain as for that which is absent from them.  They reveal a firm conviction that, when death takes place, a something  termed a soul or spirit leaves the body and continues to exist in Sheol  for a period of indefinite duration, even though there is no proof of  any belief in absolute immortality; that such spirits can return to  earth to possess and inspire the living; that they are, in appearance  and in disposition, likenesses of the men to whom they belonged, but  that, as spirits, they have larger powers and are freer from physical  limitations; that they thus form a group among a number of kinds of  spiritual existences known as Elohim, of whom Jahveh, the national  God of Israel, is one; that, consistently with this view, Jahveh was  conceived as a sort of spirit, human in aspect and in senses, and with  many human passions, but with immensely greater intelligence and power  than any other Elohim, whether human or divine. Further, the evidence  proves that this belief was the basis of the Jahveh-worship to which  Samuel and his followers were devoted; that there is strong reason for  believing, and none for doubting, that idolatry, in the shape of the  worship of the family gods or teraphim, was practised by sincere and  devout Jahveh-worshippers; that the ark, with its protective tent or  tabernacle, was regarded as a specially, but by no means exclusively,  favoured sanctuary of Jahveh;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],[0,"Our Bird Comrades (#4)"],[1," of the yellow-breasted chats, the indigo buntings, the blue-gray  gnat catchers, and the Kentucky warblers.  To this day I feel a longing  to visit the secluded spot where I held so many pleasant interviews  with these birds.    Another Kansas bird that was new to my eyes and that afforded me much  delight was the Harris sparrow--a distinctively western species, not  known, or at least very rarely, east of the Mississippi River.  He is  truly a fine bird, a little larger than the fox sparrow, neatly clad,  his breast prettily decorated with a brooch of black spots held in  place by a slender necklace of the same color, while his throat and  forehead are bordered with black.  His rump and upper tail coverts are  a delicate shade of grayish brown, by which he may be readily  distinguished from the fox sparrow, whose rear parts are reddish brown.  His beak, feet, and legs are of a pinkish tint, making him look quite  trig and dressy.  The latest of the spring arrivals were the most  highly colored, having the whole chin, throat, and top of the head a  glossy, uniform black.    It would appear that the most matured individuals migrate farthest  south in winter.  That, at least, would be the natural conclusion,  judging from the fact that they arrive latest in the spring in our  central latitudes.  In the southern part of Kansas the Harris sparrows  are said to be common winter sojourners, but in the north-eastern part  of the state they disappeared in November or December, and did not  return until the middle of February, or later if the weather happened  to be severe.  From the time of their vernal arrival they were to be  seen in every ramble until they took flight for their breeding haunts  in the North.  One spring some of them were still loitering in Kansas  on the eleventh of May, and were singing blithely, no doubt waiting for  the winter cold of their summer homes to be well past before they  ventured farther toward the arctic lands.    In general, the habits of these birds are much like those of the  white-throated sparrows, which are much more common in the East than in  the West.  The Harris sparrows are fond of copses and hedges, and  especially of brush heaps in new grounds.  So marked, indeed, is their  penchant for brush heaps that I almost wish one might re-christen them  \"brush-heap sparrows.\"  Many a time I have played a little trick on the  unsuspecting birds by stealing up to a brush pile and giving it a  sudden blow with my cane; then a whole covey of them would dash  pellmell from their covert with loud chirps of protest against such  wantonness.    Sometimes they are found in the depths of the woods, providing there is  thick underbrush in which they can conceal themselves.  I seldom found  them in open places either in the woods or fields.  Yet, shy as they  are, they have a fondness for the dense hedges along the highways,  flitting and chirping as the traveler passes by.    Being wary birds, they do not wander far from their hiding places, into  which they precipitate themselves at the approach of a supposed danger.  It was quite a while before I could get a clear view of their breasts,  for, with provoking persistence, they kept their tails turned toward  me.  However, when once you really become acquainted with a bird, it  seems to lose part of its shyness, and so after a time I often had the  Harris sparrows in plain view.  One of their characteristic habits was  to stand at full height on the top of a brush heap, with tail lifted,  crest feathers erect, and eyes wide open, the picture of wild  alertness.  In such poses they are indeed handsome birds.    It was March 5, 1898, when I heard the first song of this sparrow, and  even then it was only a fragment of a song.  But, the weather remaining  pleasant, the sixteenth of the month brought a fine concert.  The  bird's song was a surprise to me.  It began with a prolonged run so  much like the opening tremolo of the white-throated sparrow that it  might have led the most expert ornithologist astray.  The fact is, I  looked around for quite a while in search of a white-throat, thinking  him still a little out of tune, and therefore unable to finish his  chanson; and I was undeceived only by the singing of several Harris  sparrows that with unusual boldness had perched in plain sight.  The  resemblance ceased, however, with the opening notes, for the western  bird did not add the sweet, rhythmic triad of his white-throated  cousin, the closing part of his song being only a somewhat labored  trill of no distinct character, and not fulfilling the promise of his  initial strain.    In the concerts of these birds--and frequently many of them would be  trilling at the same time--they sang in several different keys, some of  them striking the treble and others dropping almost to the alto.  Occasionally two birds in different parts of a field would sing  responsively, one trill running very high in the scale, the other an  octave lower.  It seemed almost as if the responsive exercise was  engaged in intentionally.    The Harris sparrow has another song which is quite unlike his melodious  trill.  It is delivered in a loud voice of little musical quality, and  the notes are pounded out in a percussive style, like the explosion in  quick succession of a number of little cartridges.  Yet you must be  quite close to the bird in order to hear the queer canticle distinctly,  and when you do hear it you will wonder why nature ever put such a song  into a bird's larynx.  The Harris sparrow also utters an explosive  alarm-call, which expresses not a little petulance and concern.    One day a pretty picture was made by two of these birds that stood face  to face on a brush heap, bowing at each other, each threatening to peck  the other's head off, and both singing all the while at the top of  their voices, yet each afraid, in spite of his bluster, to close with  his opponent in actual contest.  It was a miniature exhibition of the  beak-to-beak challenging often indulged in by two rival cocks of the  farmyard.  For some minutes the little farce was kept up, then one of  the birds became tired of the game and darted over to the next brush  heap.    I have said that these birds are scarcely known east of the Mississippi  River, but Mr. Ridgway says that they are occasionally seen during  migration in Illinois and Wisconsin.  In eastern Kansas and western  Missouri they are common, almost abundant, during both the vernal and  autumnal migrations, and after you have once cultivated their  acquaintance they are likable, if not quite companionable, birds.  But  familiar as they are in the regions named, they are still something of  a mystery to the naturalists of our country, for Mr. Ridgway says that  their \"breeding range is unknown,\" save that there is a doubtful record  of one nest at Fort Custer, Montana; while Mrs. Bailey says: \"The  breeding range of the Harris sparrow is unknown except for Mr. Preble's  Fort Churchill record.  The last of July, among the dwarf spruces of  Fort Churchill, he found an adult male and female with young just from  the nest.\"  It will be remembered that Fort Churchill is away up on the  coast of the Hudson Bay.  It is probable, therefore, that the nest of  the Harris sparrow has never been found by any of the naturalists of  America.  Who would suppose that these birds, so numerous and so well  known in Kansas, would, in the breeding season, surround themselves  with such an air of mystery?    It was in Kansas, too, that I really came to know the Lincoln sparrow  and hear his song, although I had caught a few fleeting glimpses of him  in the East, and also in the neighborhood of Duluth, Minnesota.  In the  Sunflower state his conduct was just about as inconsistent as it could  have been without being downright absurd.  What do I mean by that?  Why, while he was as wild as a deer, he still came to town, flitting  about in the bushes of a vacant lot near my house, and even visiting  the fence between my yard and the adjoining one, hopping about on the  ground with one eye on the lookout for nits and worms and the other for  human disturbers.  My attention was first drawn to him by hearing a  squeaky little trill in the vacant lot.  But, my! how wary he was when  I went out to find him!  The song bore some resemblance to that of the  house wren, but had not so rolling and gurgling a quality, and was  pitched to a slightly higher and finer key.  For a long time he kept  himself ensconced in the thicket, trilling saucily at intervals, as if  daring me to find him if I could, and when I finally drove him out of  his hiding place, he darted off in a zigzag course to another bush  clump, into which he dropped in the greatest possible haste.    By and by his curiosity got the better of him, and he flitted to the  top of a brush heap and peeped out at me surreptitiously.  My glass was  upon him in a moment, revealing his whitish throat and mottled chest  washed with buff, the latter being his characteristic marking.  A few  days later he was singing in a small apple tree by my neighbor's fence.  I stole as close to him as I could and peered at him through my  binocular, while he returned the compliment by peering at me, and then  warily ventured to rehearse his little tune.  The least movement on my  part would startle him, cause him to flit to another perch and crane  out his neck to glare at me questioningly with wild, dilated eyes,  uncertain whether I was to be trusted or not.  Both of us presently  grew tired of our strained position, and so I walked off and he flew  away.  No doubt there was mutual satisfaction in the inspection we gave  each other; at least, I felt well satisfied with having heard the song  of so shy a bird.  His stay in my neighborhood lasted only a few days;  then he left as mysteriously as he had come, without even the courtesy  of a good-bye.  He went to his summer home in the North, and I did not  see"]]]
