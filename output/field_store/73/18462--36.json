Sit down there, you baby,  and write out a promissory note.\"    Maitre Quennebert made some further show of resistance, but at last  yielded to the widow's importunity. It is needless to say that the whole  thing was a comedy on his part, except that he really needed the money.  But he did not need it to replace a sum of which a faithless friend had  robbed him, but to satisfy his own creditors, who, out of all patience  with him, were threatening to sue him, and his only reason for seeking  out Madame de Rapally was to take advantage of her generous disposition  towards himself. His feigned delicacy was intended to induce her to  insist so urgently, that in accepting he should not fall too much in her  esteem, but should seem to yield to force. And his plan met with  complete success, for at the end of the transaction he stood higher than  ever in the opinion of his fair creditor, on account of the noble  sentiments he had expressed. The note was written out in legal form and  the money counted down on the spot.    \"How glad I am!\" said she then, while Quennebert still kept up some  pretence of delicate embarrassment, although he could not resist casting  a stolen look at the bag of crowns lying on the table beside his cloak.  \"Do you intend to go back to Saint Denis to-night?\"    Even had such been his intention, the notary would have taken very good  care not to say so; for he foresaw the accusations of imprudence that  would follow, the enumeration of the dangers by the way; and it was  quite on the cards even that, having thus aroused his fears, his fair  hostess should in deference to them offer him hospitality for the night,  and he did not feel inclined for an indefinitely prolonged tete-a-tete.    \"No;\" he said, \"I am going to sleep at Maitre Terrasson's, rue des  Poitevins; I have sent him word to expect me. But although his house is  only a few yards distant, I must leave you earlier than I could have  wished, on account of this money.\"    \"Will you think of me?\"    \"How can you ask?\" replied Quennebert, with a sentimental expression.  \"You have compelled me to accept the money, but--I shall not be happy  till I have repaid you. Suppose this loan should make us fall out?\"    \"You may be quite sure that if you don't pay when the bill falls due, I  shall have recourse to the law.\"    \"Oh, I know that very well.\"    \"I shall enforce all my rights as a creditor.\"    \"I expect nothing else.\"    \"I shall show no pity.\"    And the widow gave a saucy laugh and shook her finger at him.    \"Madame Rapally,\" said the notary, who was most anxious to bring this  conversation to an end, dreading every moment that it would take a  languishing tone,-\"Madame Rapally, will you add to your goodness by  granting me one more favour?\"    \"What is it?\"    \"The gratitude that is simulated is not difficult to bear, but genuine,  sincere gratitude, such as I feel, is a heavy burden, as I can assure  you. It is much easier to give than to receive. Promise me, then, that  from now till the year is up there shall be no more reference between us  to this money, and that we shall go on being good friends as before.  Leave it to me to make arrangements to acquit myself honourably of my  obligations towards you. I need say no more; till a year's up, mum's the  word.\"    \"It shall be as you desire, Maitre Quennebert,\" answered Madame Rapally,  her eyes shining with delight. \"It was never my intention to lay you  under embarrassing obligations, and I leave it all to you. Do you know  that I am beginning to believe in presentiments?\"    \"You becoming superstitious! Why, may I ask?\"    \"I refused to do a nice little piece of ready-money business this  morning.\"    \"Did you?\"    \"Yes, because I had a sort of feeling that made me resist all temptation  to leave myself without cash. Imagine! I received a visit to-day from a  great lady who lives in this house--in the suite of apartments next to  mine.\"    \"What is her name?\"    \"Mademoiselle de Guerchi.\"    \"And what did she want with you?\"    \"She called in order to ask me to buy, for four hundred livres, some of  her jewels which are well worth six hundred, for I understand such  things; or should I prefer it to lend her that sum and keep the jewels  as security? It appears that mademoiselle is in great straits. De  Guerchi--do you know the name?\"    \"I think I have heard it.\"    \"They say she has had a stormy past, and has been greatly talked of; but  then half of what one hears is lies. Since she came to live here she has  been very quiet. No visitors except one--a nobleman, a duke--wait a  moment! What's his name? The Duc-Duc de Vitry; and for over three weeks  even he hasn't been near her. I imagine from this absence that they have  fallen out, and that she is beginning to feel the want of money.\"    \"You seem to be intimately acquainted with this young woman's affairs.\"    \"Indeed I am, and yet I never spoke to her till this morning.\"    \"How did you get your information, then?\"    \"By chance. The room adjoining this and one of those she occupies were  formerly one large room, which is now divided into two by a partition  wall covered with tapestry; but in the two corners the plaster has  crumbled away with time, and one can see into the room through slits in  the tapestry without being seen oneself. Are you inquisitive?\"    \"Not more than you, Madame Rapally.\"    \"Come with me. Someone knocked at the street door a few moments ago;  there's no one else in the douse likely to have visitors at this hour.  Perhaps her admirer has come back.\"    \"If so, we are going to witness a scene of recrimination or  reconciliation. How delightful!\"    Although he was not leaving the widow's lodgings, Maitre Quennebert took  up his hat and cloak and the blessed bag of crown pieces, and followed  Madame Rapally on tiptoe, who on her side moved as slowly as a tortoise  and as lightly as she could. They succeeded in turning the handle of the  door into the next room without making much noise.    \"'Sh!\" breathed the widow softly; \"listen, they are speaking.\"    She pointed to the place where he would find a peep-hole in one corner  of the room, and crept herself towards the corresponding corner.  Quennebert, who was by no means anxious to have her at his side,  motioned to her to blow out the light. This being done, he felt secure,  for he knew that in the intense darkness which now enveloped them she  could not move from her place without knocking against the furniture  between them, so he glued his face to the partition. An opening just  large enough for one eye allowed him to see everything that was going on  in the next room. Just as he began his observations, the treasurer at  Mademoiselle de Guerchi's invitation was about to take a seat near her,  but not too near for perfect respect. Both of them were silent, and  appeared to labour under great embarrassment at finding themselves  together, and explanations did not readily begin. The lady had not an  idea of the motive of the visit, and her quondam lover feigned the  emotion necessary to the success of his undertaking. Thus Maitre  Quennebert had full time to examine both, and especially Angelique. The  reader will doubtless desire to know what was the result of the notary's  observation.          CHAPTER III      ANGELIQUE-LOUISE DE GUERCHI was a woman of about twenty-eight years of  age, tall, dark, and well made. The loose life she had led had, it is  true, somewhat staled her beauty, marred the delicacy of her complexion,  and coarsened the naturally elegant curves of her figure; but it is such  women who from time immemorial have had the strongest attraction for  profligate men. It seems as if dissipation destroyed the power to  perceive true beauty, and the man of pleasure must be aroused to  admiration by a bold glance and a meaning smile, and will only seek  satisfaction along the trail left by vice. Louise-Angelique was  admirably adapted for her way of life; not that her features wore an  expression of shameless effrontery, or that the words that passed her  lips bore habitual testimony to the disorders of her existence, but that  under a calm and sedate demeanour there lurked a secret and indefinable  charm. Many other women possessed more regular features, but none of  them had a greater power of seduction. We must add that she owed that  power entirely to her physical perfections, for except in regard to the  devices necessary to her calling, she showed no cleverness, being  ignorant, dull and without inner resources of any kind. As her  temperament led her to share the desires she excited, she was really  incapable of resisting an attack conducted with skill and ardour, and if  the Duc de Vitry had not been so madly in love, which is the same as  saying that he was hopelessly blind, silly, and dense to everything  around him, he might have found a score of opportunities to overcome her  resistance. We have already seen that she was so straitened in money  matters that she had been driven to try to sell her jewels that very,  morning.    Jeannin was the first to 'break silence.    \"You are astonished at my visit, I know, my charming Angelique. But you  must excuse my thus appearing so unexpectedly before you. The truth is,  I found it impossible to leave Paris without seeing you once more.\"    \"Thank you for your kind remembrance,\" said she, \"but I did not at all  expect it.\"    \"Come, come, you are offended with me.\"    She gave him a glance of mingled disdain and resentment; but he went on,  in a timid, wistful tone--    \"I know that my conduct must have seemed strange to you, and I  acknowledge that nothing can justify a man for suddenly leaving the  woman he loves--I do not dare to say the woman who loves him--without a  word of explanation. But, dear Angelique, I was jealous.\"    \"Jealous!\" she repeated incredulously."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#4)"],[1," temple.  There still lies Robert, represented on his tomb in the dress of a king  and in a monk's frock, on the right of the monument to his son Charles,  the Duke of Calabria.          CHAPTER II      As soon as the obsequies were over, Andre's tutor hastily assembled the  chief Hungarian lords, and it was decided in a council held in the  presence of the prince and with his consent, to send letters to his  mother, Elizabeth of Poland, and his brother, Louis of Hungary, to make  known to them the purport of Robert's will, and at the same time to  lodge a complaint at the court of Avignon against the conduct of the  princes and people of Naples in that they had proclaimed Joan alone  Queen of Naples, thus overlooking the rights of her husband, and further  to demand for him the pope's order for Andre's coronation. Friar Robert,  who had not only a profound knowledge of the court intrigues, but also  the experience of a philosopher and all a monk's cunning, told his pupil  that he ought to profit by the depression of spirit the king's death had  produced in Joan, and ought not to suffer her favourites to use this  time in influencing her by their seductive counsels.    But Joan's ability to receive consolation was quite as ready as her  grief had at first been impetuous; the sobs which seemed to be breaking  her heart ceased all at once; new thoughts, more gentle, less  lugubrious, took possession of the young queen's mind; the trace of  tears vanished, and a smile lit up her liquid eyes like the sun's ray  following on rain. This change, anxiously awaited, was soon observed by  Joan's chamberwoman: she stole to the queen's room, and falling on her  knees, in accents of flattery and affection, she offered her first  congratulations to her lovely mistress. Joan opened her arms and held  her in a long embrace, for Dona Cancha was far more to her than a  lady-in-waiting; she was the companion of infancy, the depositary of all  her secrets, the confidante of her most private thoughts. One had but to  glance at this young girl to understand the fascination she could  scarcely fail to exercise over the queen's mind. She had a frank and  smiling countenance, such as inspires confidence and captivates the mind  at first sight. Her face had an irresistible charm, with clear blue  eyes, warm golden hair, mouth bewitchingly turned up at the corners, and  delicate little chin. Wild, happy, light of heart, pleasure and love  were the breath of her being; her dainty refinement, her charming  inconstancies, all made her at sixteen as lovely as an angel, though at  heart she was corrupt. The whole court was at her feet, and Joan felt  more affection for her than for her own sister.    \"Well, my dear Cancha,\" she murmured, with a sigh, \"you find me very sad  and very unhappy!\"    \"And you find me, fair queen,\" replied the confidante, fixing an  admiring look on Joan,--\"you find me just the opposite, very happy that  I can lay at your feet before anyone else the proof of the joy that the  people of Naples are at this moment feeling. Others perhaps may envy you  the crown that shines upon your brow, the throne which is one of the  noblest in the world, the shouts of this entire town that sound rather  like worship than homage; but I, madam, I envy you your lovely black  hair, your dazzling eyes, your more than mortal grace, which make every  man adore you.\"    \"And yet you know, my Cancha, I am much to be pitied both as a queen and  as a woman: when one is fifteen a crown is heavy to wear, and I have not  the liberty of the meanest of my subjects--I mean in my affections; for  before I reached an age when I could think I was sacrificed to a man  whom I can never love.\"    \"Yet, madam,\" replied Cancha in a more insinuating voice, \"in this court  there is a young cavalier who might by virtue of respect, love, and  devotion have made you forget the claims of this foreigner, alike  unworthy to be our king and to be your husband.\"    The queen heaved a heavy sigh.    \"When did you lose your skill to read my heart?\" she cried. \"Must I  actually tell you that this love is making me wretched? True, at the  very first this unsanctioned love was a keen joy: a new life seemed to  wake within my heart; I was drawn on, fascinated by the prayers, the  tears, and the despair of this man, by the opportunities that his mother  so easily granted, she whom I had always looked upon as my own mother; I  have loved him.... O my God, I am still so young, and my past is so  unhappy. At times strange thoughts come into my mind: I fancy he no  longer loves me, that he never did love me; I fancy he has been led on  by ambition, by self-interest, by some ignoble motive, and has only  feigned a feeling that he has never really felt. I feel myself a  coldness I cannot account for; in his presence I am constrained, I am  troubled by his look, his voice makes me tremble: I fear him; I would  sacrifice a year of my life could I never have listened to him.\"    These words seemed to touch the young confidante to the very depths of  her soul; a shade of sadness crossed her brow, her eyelids dropped, and  for some time she answered nothing, showing sorrow rather than surprise.  Then, lifting her head gently, she said, with visible embarrassment--    \"I should never have dared to pass so severe a judgment upon a man whom  my sovereign lady has raised above other men by casting upon him a look  of kindness; but if Robert of Cabane has deserved the reproach of  inconstancy and ingratitude, if he has perjured himself like a coward,  he must indeed be the basest of all miserable beings, despising a  happiness which other men might have entreated of God the whole time of  their life and paid for through eternity. One man I know, who weeps both  night and day without hope or consolation, consumed by a slow and  painful malady, when one word might yet avail to save him, did it come  from the lips of my noble mistress.\"    \"I will not hear another word,\" cried Joan, suddenly rising; \"there  shall be no new cause for remorse in my life. Trouble has come upon me  through my loves, both lawful and criminal; alas! no longer will I try  to control my awful fate, I will bow my head without a murmur. I am the  queen, and I must yield myself up for the good of my subjects.\"    \"Will you forbid me, madam,\" replied Dona Cancha in a kind, affectionate  tone--\"will you forbid me to name Bertrand of Artois in your presence,  that unhappy man, with the beauty of an angel and the modesty of a girl?  Now that you are queen and have the life and death of your subjects in  your own keeping, will you feel no kindness towards an unfortunate one  whose only fault is to adore you, who strives with all his mind and  strength to bear a chance look of yours without dying of his joy?\"    \"I have struggled hard never to look on him,\" cried the queen, urged by  an impulse she was not strong enough to conquer: then, to efface the  impression that might well have been made on her friend's mind, she  added severely, \"I forbid you to pronounce his name before me; and if he  should ever venture to complain, I bid you tell him from me that the  first time I even suspect the cause of his distress he will be banished  for ever from my presence.\"    \"Ah, madam, dismiss me also; for I shall never be strong enough to do so  hard a bidding: the unhappy man who cannot awake in your heart so much  as a feeling of pity may now be struck down by yourself in your wrath,  for here he stands; he has heard your sentence, and come to die at your  feet.\"    The last words were spoken in a louder voice, so that they might be  heard from outside, and Bertrand of Artois came hurriedly into the room  and fell on his knees before the queen. For a long time past the young  lady-in-waiting had perceived that Robert of Cabane had, through his own  fault, lost the love of Joan; for his tyranny had indeed become more  unendurable to her than her husband's.    Dona Cancha had been quick enough to perceive that the eyes of her young  mistress were wont to rest with a kind of melancholy gentleness on  Bertrand, a young man of handsome appearance but with a sad and dreamy  expression; so when she made up her mind to speak in his interests, she  was persuaded that the queen already loved him. Still, a bright colour  overspread Joan's face, and her anger would have fallen on both culprits  alike, when in the next room a sound of steps was heard, and the voice  of the grand seneschal's widow in conversation with her son fell on the  ears of the three young people like a clap of thunder. Dona Cancha, pale  as death, stood trembling; Bertrand felt that he was lost--all the more  because his presence compromised the queen; Joan only, with that  wonderful presence of mind she was destined to preserve in the most  difficult crises of her future life, thrust the young man against the  carved back of her bed, and concealed him completely beneath the ample  curtain: she then signed to Cancha to go forward and meet the governess  and her son.    But before we conduct into the queen's room these two persons, whom our  readers may remember in Joan's train about the bed of King Robert, we  must relate the circumstances which had caused the family of the  Catanese to rise with incredible rapidity from the lowest class of the  people to the highest rank at court. When Dona Violante of Aragon, first  wife of Robert of Anjou, became the mother of Charles, who was later on  the Duke of Calabria, a nurse was sought for the infant among the most  handsome women of the people. After inspecting many women of equal merit  as regards beauty, youth and health, the princess's choice lighted on  Philippa, a young Catanese woman, the wife of a fisherman of Trapani,  and by condition a laundress. This young woman, as she washed her linen  on the bank of a stream, had dreamed strange dreams: she had fancied  herself summoned to court, wedded to a great personage,"]]]
