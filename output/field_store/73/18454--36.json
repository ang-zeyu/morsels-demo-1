For since men would have to be subject to this head, not from  God's command, but from their personal good pleasure, it would  easily and in a short time be despised, and at last retain no  member; neither would it have to be forever confined to Rome  or any other place, but it might be wherever and in whatever  church God would grant a man fit for the [taking upon him such  a great] office. Oh, the complicated and confused state of  affairs [perplexity] that would result!    Therefore the Church can never be better governed and  preserved than if we all live under one head, Christ, and all  the bishops equal in office (although they be unequal in  gifts), be diligently joined in unity of doctrine, faith,  Sacraments, prayer, and works of love, etc., as St. Jerome  writes that the priests at Alexandria together and in common  governed the churches, as did also the apostles, and  afterwards all bishops throughout all Christendom, until the  Pope raised his head above all.    This teaching shows forcefully that the Pope is the very  Antichrist, who has exalted himself above, and opposed himself  against Christ because he will not permit Christians to be  saved without his power, which, nevertheless, is nothing, and  is neither ordained nor commanded by God. This is, properly  speaking to exalt himself above all that is called God as Paul  says, 2 Thess. 2, 4. Even the Turks or the Tartars, great  enemies of Christians as they are, do not do this, but they  allow whoever wishes to believe in Christ, and take bodily  tribute and obedience from Christians.    The Pope, however, prohibits this faith, saying that to be  saved a person must obey him. This we are unwilling to do,  even though on this account we must die in God s name. This  all proceeds from the fact that the Pope has wished to be  called the supreme head of the Christian Church by divine  right. Accordingly he had to make himself equal and superior  to Christ, and had to cause himself to be proclaimed the head  and then the lord of the Church, and finally of the whole  world, and simply God on earth, until he has dared to issue  commands even to the angels in heaven. And when we distinguish  the Pope s teaching from, or measure and hold it against, Holy  Scripture, it is found [it appears plainly] that the Pope s  teaching, where it is best, has been taken from the imperial  and heathen law and treats of political matters and decisions  or rights, as the Decretals show; furthermore, it teaches of  ceremonies concerning churches, garments, food, persons and  [similar] puerile, theatrical and comical things without  measure, but in all these things nothing at all of Christ,  faith, and the commandments of God. Lastly, it is nothing else  than the devil himself, because above and against God he urges  [and disseminates] his [papal] falsehoods concerning masses,  purgatory, the monastic life, one's own works and [fictitious]  divine worship (for this is the very Papacy [upon each of  which the Papacy is altogether founded and is standing]), and  condemns, murders and tortures all Christians who do not exalt  and honor these abominations [of the Pope] above all things.  Therefore, just as little as we can worship the devil himself  as Lord and God, we can endure his apostle, the Pope, or  Antichrist, in his rule as head or lord. For to lie and to  kill, and to destroy body and soul eternally, that is wherein  his papal government really consists, as I have very clearly  shown in many books.    In these four articles they will have enough to condemn in the  Council. For they cannot and will not concede us even the  least point in one of these articles. Of this we should be  certain, and animate ourselves with [be forewarned and made  firm in] the hope that Christ, our Lord, has attacked His  adversary, and he will press the attack home [pursue and  destroy him] both by His Spirit and coming. Amen.    For in the Council we will stand not before the Emperor or the  political magistrate, as at Augsburg (where the Emperor  published a most gracious edict, and caused matters to be  heard kindly [and dispassionately]), but [we will appear]  before the Pope and devil himself, who intends to listen to  nothing, but merely [when the case has been publicly  announced] to condemn, to murder and to force us to idolatry.  Therefore we ought not here to kiss his feet, or to say: Thou  art my gracious lord, but as the angel in Zechariah 3, 2 said  to Satan: The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.          THE THIRD PART OF THE ARTICLES.    Concerning the following articles we may [will be able to]  treat with learned and reasonable men, or among ourselves. The  Pope and his [the Papal] government do not care much about  these. For with them conscience is nothing, but money, [glory]  honors, power are [to them] everything.    I. Of Sin.    Here we must confess, as Paul says in Rom. 5, 11, that sin  originated [and entered the world] from one man Adam, by whose  disobedience all men were made sinners, [and] subject to death  and the devil. This is called original or capital sin.    The fruits of this sin are afterwards the evil deeds which are  forbidden in the Ten Commandments, such as [distrust]  unbelief, false faith, idolatry, to be without the fear of  God, presumption [recklessness], despair, blindness [or  complete loss of sight], and, in short not to know or regard  God; furthermore to lie, to swear by [to abuse] God's name [to  swear falsely], not to pray, not to call upon God, not to  regard [to despise or neglect] God's Word, to be disobedient  to parents, to murder, to be unchaste, to steal, to deceive,  etc.    This hereditary sin is so deep and [horrible] a corruption of  nature that no reason can understand it, but it must be  [learned and] believed from the revelation of Scriptures, Ps.  51, 5; Rom. 6, 12 ff.; Ex. 33, 3; Gen. 3, 7 ff. Hence, it is  nothing but error and blindness in regard to this article what  the scholastic doctors have taught, namely:    That since the fall of Adam the natural powers of man have  remained entire and incorrupt, and that man by nature has a  right reason and a good will; which things the philosophers  teach.    Again that man has a free will to do good and omit evil, and,  conversely, to omit good and do evil.    Again, that man by his natural powers can observe and keep  [do] all the commands of God.    Again, that, by his natural powers, man can love God above all  things and his neighbor as himself.    Again, if a man does as much as is in him, God certainly  grants him His grace.    Again, if he wishes to go to the Sacrament, there is no need  of a good intention to do good, but it is sufficient if he has  not a wicked purpose to commit sin; so entirely good is his  nature and so efficacious the Sacrament.    [Again,] that it is not founded upon Scripture that for a good  work the Holy Ghost with His grace is necessary.    Such and many similar things have arisen from want of  understanding and ignorance as regards both this sin and  Christ, our Savior and they are truly heathen dogmas, which we  cannot endure. For if this teaching were right [approved],  then Christ has died in vain, since there is in man no defect  nor sin for which he should have died; or He would have died  only for the body, not for the soul, inasmuch as the soul is  [entirely] sound, and the body only is subject to death.      II. Of the Law    Here we hold that the Law was given by God, first, to restrain  sin by threats and the dread of punishment, and by the promise  and offer of grace and benefit. But all this miscarried on  account of the wickedness which sin has wrought in man. For  thereby a part [some] were rendered worse, those, namely, who  are hostile to [hate] the Law, because it forbids what they  like to do, and enjoins what they do not like to do.  Therefore, wherever they can escape [if they were not  restrained by] punishment, they [would] do more against the  Law than before. These, then, are the rude and wicked  [unbridled and secure] men, who do evil wherever they [notice  that they] have the opportunity.    The rest become blind and arrogant [are smitten with arrogance  and blindness], and [insolently] conceive the opinion that  they observe and can observe the Law by their own powers, as  has been said above concerning the scholastic theologians;  thence come the hypocrites and [self-righteous or] false  saints.    But the chief office or force of the Law is that it reveal  original sin with all its fruits, and show man how very low  his nature has fallen, and has become [fundamentally and]  utterly corrupted; as the Law must tell man that he has no God  nor regards [cares for] God, and worships other gods, a matter  which before and without the Law he would not have believed.  In this way he becomes terrified, is humbled, desponds,  despairs, and anxiously desires aid, but sees no escape; he  begins to be an enemy of [enraged at] God, and to murmur, etc.  This is what Paul says, Rom. 4, 15: The Law worketh wrath. And  Rom. 5, 20: Sin is increased by the Law. [The Law entered that  the offense might abound.]      III. Of Repentance.    This office [of the Law] the New Testament retains and urges,  as St. Paul, Rom. 1, 18 does, saying: The wrath of God is  revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and  unrighteousness of men. Again, 3, 19: All the world is guilty  before God. No man is righteous before Him. And Christ says,  John 16, 8: The Holy Ghost will reprove the world of sin.    This, then, is the thunderbolt of God by which He strikes in a  heap [hurls to the ground] both manifest sinners and false  saints [hypocrites], and suffers no one to be in the right  [declares no one righteous], but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27341"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 4, June 1906 (#4)"],[1,"and not on that of piety and obedience; on the  abolition of the fiction _God_, the eternal and absolute cause of  subjection.    _Mixed_--Because it favors the coeducation of the sexes in a constant,  fraternal, familiar company of children, boys and girls, which gives to  the character of their manners a special earnestness.    To the scientific instruction must be added manual apprenticeship,  instruction with which it is in a constant connection of balance and  reciprocity, and also esthetic instruction (music, art, etc.), which in  point of view of an integral development has certainly not a small  importance.    To turn our attention towards the child, to encourage the development of  its initiative, to impress it with a sentiment of its dignity, to  preserve it from cowardice and falsehood, to make it observe the _pros_  and _cons_ of all social conceptions, to educate it for the struggle,  that is the great work, scarcely yet begun, which awaits us.    That will be the task of the nearest future if we will act logically and  firmly.    [Illustration]          THE ANTICHRIST.        From \"The Antichrist,\" by Friedrich Nietzsche. Edited by Alexander      Tille, translated by Thomas Common. Publishers: Macmillan & Co. New      York.      I MAKE war against this theological instinct: I have found traces of it  everywhere. Whoever has theological blood in his veins is from the very  beginning ambiguous and disloyal with respect to everything. The pathos  which develops therefrom calls itself belief: the closing of the eye  once for all with respect to one's self, so as not to suffer from the  sight--of incurable falsity. A person makes for himself a morality, a  virtue, a sanctity out of this erroneous perspective towards all things,  he unites the good conscience to the _false_ mode of seeing,--he demands  that no _other_ mode of perspective be any longer of value, after he has  made his own sacrosanct with the names of \"God,\" \"salvation,\" and  \"eternity.\" I have digged out the theologist-instinct everywhere; it is  the most diffused, the most peculiarly _subterranean_ form of falsity  that exists on earth. What a theologian feels as true, _must_ needs be  false: one has therein almost a criterion of truth. It is his most  fundamental self-preservative instinct which forbids reality to be held  in honor, or even to find expression on any point. As far as  theologist-influence extends, the _judgment of value_ is turned right  about, the concepts of \"true\" and \"false\" are necessarily reversed: what  is most injurious to life is here called \"true,\" what raises, elevates,  affirms, justifies, and makes it triumph is called \"false.\"                               *       *       *    Let us not underestimate this: _we ourselves_, we free spirits, are  already a \"Transvaluation of all Values,\" an incarnate declaration of  war against and triumph over all old concepts of \"true\" and \"untrue.\"  The most precious discernments into things are the latest discovered:  the most precious discernments, however, are the _methods_. _All_  methods, _all_ presuppositions of our present-day science, have for  millenniums been held in the most profound contempt: by reason of them a  person was excluded from intercourse with \"honest\" men--he passed for an  \"enemy of God,\" a despiser of truth, a \"possessed\" person. As a  scientific man, a person was a Chandala.... We have had the entire  pathos of mankind against us--their concept of that which truth _ought_  to be, which the service of truth _ought_ to be: every \"thou shalt\" has  been hitherto directed _against_ us. Our objects, our practices, our  quiet, prudent, mistrustful mode--all appeared to mankind as absolutely  unworthy and contemptible.--In the end one might, with some  reasonableness, ask one's self if it was not really an esthetic taste  which kept mankind in such long blindness: they wanted a _picturesque_  effect from truth, they wanted in like manner the knowing ones to  operate strongly on their senses. Our _modesty_ was longest against the  taste of mankind.... Oh how they made that out, these turkey-cocks of  God----.                               *       *       *    The Christian concept of God--God as God of the sick, God as  cobweb-spinner, God as spirit--is one of the most corrupt concepts of  God ever arrived at on earth; it represents perhaps the gauge of low  water in the descending development of the God-type. God degenerated to  the _contradiction of life_, instead of being its transfiguration and  its eternal _yea_! In God, hostility announced to life, to nature, to  the will to life! God as the formula for every calumny of \"this world,\"  for every lie of \"another world!\" In God nothingness deified, the will  to nothingness declared holy!                               *       *       *    That the strong races of Northern Europe have not thrust from themselves  the Christian God, is verily no honor to their religious talent, not to  speak of their taste. They ought to have got the better of such a sickly  and decrepit product of _decadence_. There lies a curse upon them,  because they have not got the better of it: they have incorporated  sickness, old age and contradiction into all their instincts--they have  _created_ no God since! Two millenniums almost, and not a single new  God! But still continuing, and as if persisting by right, as an  _ultimatum_ and _maximum_ of the God-shaping force, of the _creator  spiritus_ in man, this pitiable God of Christian monotono-theism! This  hybrid image of ruin, derived from nullity, concept and contradiction in  which all _decadence_ instincts, all cowardices and lassitudes of soul  have their sanction!                               *       *       *    Has the celebrated story been really understood which stands at the  commencement of the Bible--the story of God's mortal terror of  _science_? It has not been understood. This priest-book _par excellence_  begins appropriately with the great inner difficulty of the priest: he  has only one great danger, consequently \"God\" has only one great  danger.--    The old God, entire \"spirit,\" entire high priest, entire perfection,  promenades in his garden: he only wants pastime. Against tedium even  Gods struggle in vain. What does he do? He contrives man--man is  entertaining.... But behold, man also wants pastime. The pity of God for  the only distress which belongs to all paradises has no bounds: he  forthwith created other animals besides. The _first_ mistake of God: man  did not find the animals entertaining--he ruled over them, but did not  even want to be an \"animal\"--God consequently created woman. And, in  fact, there was now an end of tedium--but of other things also! Woman  was the _second_ mistake of God.--\"Woman is in her essence a serpent,  Hera\"--every priest knows that: \"from woman comes _all_ the mischief in  the world\"--every priest knows that likewise. _Consequently_, _science_  also comes from her.... Only through woman did man learn to taste of the  tree of knowledge.--What had happened? The old God was seized by a  mortal terror. Man himself had become his _greatest_ mistake, he had  created a rival, science makes _godlike_; it is at an end with priests  and Gods, if man becomes scientific!--_Moral_: science is the thing  forbidden in itself--it alone is forbidden. Science is the _first_ sin,  the germ of all sin, _original_ sin. _This alone is morality._--\"Thou  shalt _not_ know:\"--the rest follows therefrom.--By his mortal terror  God was not prevented from being shrewd. How does one _defend_ one's  self against science? That was for a long time his main problem. Answer:  away with man, out of paradise! Happiness and leisure lead to  thoughts,--all thoughts are bad thoughts.... Man _shall_ not think--and  the \"priest in himself\" contrives distress, death, the danger of life in  pregnancy, every kind of misery, old age, weariness, and above all  _sickness_,--nothing but expedients in the struggle against science!  Distress does not _permit_ man to think.... And nevertheless! frightful!  the edifice of knowledge towers aloft, heaven-storming, dawning on the  Gods,--what to do!--The old God contrives _war_, he separates the  peoples, he brings it about that men mutually annihilate one another  (the priests have always had need of war ...). War, among other things,  a great disturber of science!--Incredible! Knowledge, the _emancipation  from the priest_, augments even in spite of wars.--And a final  resolution is arrived at by the old God: \"man has become  scientific,--_there is no help for it, he must be drowned!_\" ...                               *       *       *    --I have been understood. The beginning of the Bible contains the  _entire_ psychology of the priest.--The priest knows only one great  danger: that is science,--the sound concept of cause and effect. But  science flourishes on the whole only under favorable circumstances,--one  must have _superfluous_ time, one must have _superfluous_ intellect in  order to \"perceive\" ... _Consequently_ man must be made  unfortunate,--this has at all times been the logic of the priest.--One  makes out _what_ has only thereby come into the world in accordance with  this logic:--\"sin\".... The concepts of guilt and punishment, the whole  \"moral order of the world,\" have been devised _in opposition_ to  science,--_in opposition_ to a severance of man from the priest.... Man  is _not_ to look outwards, he is to look inwards into himself, he is  _not_ to look prudently and cautiously into things like a learner, he is  not to look at all, he is to _suffer_.... And he is so to suffer as to  need the priest always. _A Saviour is needed._--The concepts of guilt  and punishment, inclusive of the doctrines of \"grace,\" of \"salvation,\"  and of \"forgiveness\"--_lies_ through and through, and without any  psychological reality--have been contrived to destroy the _causal sense_  in man, they are an attack on "]]]
