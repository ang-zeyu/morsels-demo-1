Then you shall obtain what you desire; for you do       not covet great things. But commit yourself without fear       to our ministers.         Strep. I will do so in reliance upon you, for necessity       oppresses me, on account of the blood-horses, and the       marriage that ruined me. Now, therefore, let them use me       as they please. I give up this body to them to be       beaten, to be hungered, to be troubled with thirst, to       be squalid, to shiver with cold, to flay into a leathern       bottle, if I shall escape clear from my debts, and       appear to men to be bold, glib of tongue, audacious,       impudent, shameless, a fabricator of falsehoods,       inventive of words, a practiced knave in lawsuits, a       law-tablet, a thorough rattle, a fox, a sharper, a       slippery knave, a dissembler, a slippery fellow, an       impostor, a gallows-bird, a blackguard, a twister, a       troublesome fellow, a licker-up of hashes. If they call       me this, when they meet me, let them do to me absolutely       what they please. And if they like, by Ceres, let them       serve up a sausage out of me to the deep thinkers.         Cho. This man has a spirit not void of courage, but       prompt. Know, that if you learn these matters from me,       you will possess among mortals a glory as high as       heaven.         Strep. What shall I experience?         Cho. You shall pass with me the most enviable of mortal       lives the whole time.         Strep. Shall I then ever see this?         Cho. Yea, so that many be always seated at your gates,       wishing to communicate with you and come to a conference       with you, to consult with you as to actions and       affidavits of many talents, as is worthy of your       abilities.         [To Socrates.]         But attempt to teach the old man by degrees whatever you       purpose, and scrutinize his intellect, and make trial of       his mind.         Soc. Come now, tell me your own turn of mind; in order       that, when I know of what sort it is, I may now, after       this, apply to you new engines.         Strep. What? By the gods, do you purpose to besiege me?         Soc. No; I wish to briefly learn from you if you are       possessed of a good memory.         Strep. In two ways, by Jove! If anything be owing to me,       I have a very good memory; but if I owe unhappy man, I       am very forgetful.         Soc. Is the power of speaking, pray, implanted in your       nature?         Strep. Speaking is not in me, but cheating is.         Soc. How, then, will you be able to learn?         Strep. Excellently, of course.         Soc. Come, then, take care that, whenever I propound any       clever dogma about abstruse matters, you catch it up       immediately.         Strep. What then? Am I to feed upon wisdom like a dog?         Soc. This man is ignorant and brutish--I fear, old man,       lest you will need blows. Come, let me see; what do you       do if any one beat you?         Strep. I take the beating; and then, when I have waited       a little while, I call witnesses to prove it; then       again, after a short interval, I go to law.         Soc. Come, then, lay down your cloak.         Strep. Have I done any wrong?         Soc. No; but it is the rule to enter naked.         Strep. But I do not enter to search for stolen goods.         Soc. Lay it down. Why do you talk nonsense?         Strep. Now tell me this, pray. If I be diligent and       learn zealously, to which of your disciples shall I       become like?         Soc. You will no way differ from Chaerephon in       intellect.         Strep. Ah me, unhappy! I shall become half-dead.         Soc. Don't chatter; but quickly follow me hither with       smartness.         Strep. Then give me first into my hands a honeyed cake;       for I am afraid of descending within, as if into the       cave of Trophonius.         Soc. Proceed; why do you keep poking about the door?         [Exeunt Socrates and Strepsiades]         Cho. Well, go in peace, for the sake of this your       valour. May prosperity attend the man, because, being       advanced into the vale of years, he imbues his intellect       with modern subjects, and cultivates wisdom!         [Turning to the audience.]         Spectators, I will freely declare to you the truth, by       Bacchus, who nurtured me! So may I conquer, and be       accounted skillful, as that, deeming you to be clever       spectators, and this to be the cleverest of my comedies,       I thought proper to let you first taste that comedy,       which gave me the greatest labour. And then I retired       from the contest defeated by vulgar fellows, though I       did not deserve it. These things, therefore, I object to       you, a learned audience, for whose sake I was expending       this labour. But not even thus will I ever willingly       desert the discerning portion of you. For since what       time my Modest Man and my Rake  were very highly praised       here by an audience, with whom it is a pleasure even to       hold converse, and I (for I was still a virgin, and it       was not lawful for me as yet to have children) exposed       my offspring, and another girl took it up, and owned it,       and you generously reared and educated it, from this       time I have had sure pledges of your good will toward       me. Now, therefore, like that well-known Electra, has       this comedy come seeking, if haply it meet with an       audience so clever, for it will recognize, if it should       see, the lock of its brother.  But see how modest she is       by nature, who, in the first place, has come, having       stitched to her no leathern phallus hanging down, red at       the top, and thick, to set the boys a laughing;  nor yet       jeered the bald-headed, nor danced the cordax;  nor does       the old man who speaks the verses beat the person near       him with his staff, keeping out of sight wretched       ribaldry; nor has she rushed in with torches, nor does       she shout iou, iou;  but has come relying on herself and       her verses. And I, although so excellent a poet, do not       give myself airs, nor do I seek to deceive you by twice       and thrice bringing forward the same pieces; but I am       always clever at introducing new fashions, not at all       resembling each other, and all of them clever; who       struck Cleon  in the belly when at the height of his       power, and could not bear to attack him afterward when       he was down. But these scribblers, when once Hyperbolus       has given them a handle, keep ever trampling on this       wretched man and his mother. Eupolis,  indeed, first of       all craftily introduced his Maricas, having basely, base       fellow, spoiled by altering my play of the Knights,       having added to it, for the sake of the cordax, a       drunken old woman, whom Phrynichus long ago poetized,       whom the whale was for devouring. Then again Hermippus       made verses on Hyperbolus; and now all others press hard       upon Hyperbolus, imitating my simile of the eels.       Whoever, therefore, laughs at these, let him not take       pleasure in my attempts; but if you are delighted with       me and my inventions, in times to come you will seem to       be wise.              I first invoke, to join our choral band, the mighty       Jupiter, ruling on high, the monarch of gods; and the       potent master of the trident, the fierce upheaver of       earth and briny sea; and our father of great renown,       most august Aether, life-supporter of all; and the       horse-guider, who fills the plain of the earth with       exceeding bright beams, a mighty deity among gods and       mortals.              Most clever spectators, come, give us your attention;       for having been injured, we blame you to your faces. For       though we benefit the state most of all the gods, to us       alone of the deities you do not offer sacrifice nor yet       pour libations, who watch over you. For if there should       be any expedition without prudence, then we either       thunder or drizzle small rain.  And then, when you were       for choosing as your general the Paphlagonian tanner,       hateful to the gods, we contracted our brows and were       enraged; and thunder burst through the lightning; and       the Moon forsook her usual paths; and the Sun       immediately drew in his wick to himself, and declared he       would not give you light, if Cleon should be your       general. Nevertheless you chose him. For they say that       ill counsel is in this city; that the gods, however,       turn all these your mismanagements to a prosperous       issue. And how this also shall be advantageous, we will       easily teach you. If you should convict the cormorant       Cleon of bribery and embezzlement, and then make fast       his neck in the stocks, the affair will turn out for the       state to the ancient form again, if you have mismanaged       in any way, and to a prosperous issue.           Hear me again, King Phoebus, Delian Apollo, who       inhabitest the high-peaked Cynthian rock!  And thou,       blessed goddess, who inhabitest the all-golden house of       Ephesus,  in which Lydian damsels greatly reverence       thee;  and thou, our national goddess, swayer of the       aegis, Minerva,  guardian of the city! And thou, reveler       Bacchus, who, inhabiting the Parnassian rock, sparklest       with torches, conspicuous among the Delphic Bacchanals!           When we had got ready to set out hither, the Moon met       us, and commanded us first to greet the Athenians and       their allies;  and then declared that she was angry, for       that she had suffered dreadful things, though she       benefits you all, not in words, but openly. In the first       place, not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#4)"],[1," Marie  Antoinette remembered that the favorite had not been wicked. The debts  of Du Barry were paid and money enough was given to her so that she  could still give with both hands. Lucienne became an echo of Versailles.  Foreign kings and Parisian philosophers came to chat in its portals.  Minerva visited shameless Venus. But wisdom took not root at Lucienne.    For the Revolution, alas! had to cut off this charming head, which was  at one time the ideal of beauty--of court beauty. Madame du Barry gave  hospitality to the wounded at the arrest of the queen. \"These wounded  youths have no other regret than that they have not died for a princess  so worthy as your Majesty,\" she said. \"What I have done for these brave  men is only what they have merited. I consoled them, and I respect their  wounds when I think, Madame, that without their devotion, your Majesty  would no longer be alive. Lucienne is yours, Madame, for was it not your  beneficence which gave it to me? All I possess has come to me through  the royal family. I have too much loyalty to forget it.\"    But negro Zamor became a citizen like Mirabeau. It was Zamor who took to  Du Barry her lover's head. It was Zamor who denounced her at the club of  the Jacobins. \"The fealty (faith) of the black man is white,\" said the  negro. But he learned how to make it red. Jeanne was imprisoned and  tried before Dumas.    \"Your age?\"    \"Forty-two years.\" She was really forty-seven. Coquetry even at the  guillotine.    The public accuser, Fouquier Tinville, was not disarmed by the sweet  voluptuousness still possessed by this pale and already fading beauty.  He accused her of treason against the nation. Could the defender of Du  Barry, who had also defended Marie Antoinette, find an eloquent word?  No; Fouquier Tinville was more eloquent than Chauveau-Lagarde. So  the mistress of Louis was condemned. It was eleven o'clock in the  evening--the hour for supper at Versailles when she was queen!    She passed the night in prayer and weeping, or rather in a frenzy of  fright. In the morning she said it was \"too early to die\"; she wished  to have a little time in order to make some disclosures. The Comite sent  someone to listen to her. What did she say? She revealed all that was  hidden away at Lucienne; she gave word by word an inventory of the  treasures she had concealed, forgetting nothing, for did not each word  give her a second of time?    \"Have you finished?\" said the inquisitor. \"No,\" said Jeanne. \"I have not  mentioned a silver syringe concealed under the staircase!\"    Meanwhile the horses of destiny stamped with impatience, and spectators  were knocking at the prison gate. When they put her, already half  dead, on the little cart, she bent her head and grew pale. The Du Barry  alone--a sinner without redemption.    She saw the people in the square of Louis XV; she struck her breast  three times and murmured: \"It is my fault!\" But this Christian  resignation abandoned her when she mounted the scaffold--there where the  statue of Louis XV had been--and she implored of the executioner:    \"One moment, Mr. Executioner! One moment more!\"    But the executioner was pitiless Sanson. It was block and the  knife--without the \"one moment!\"    Such was the last bed of the Du Barry. Had the almanac of Liege only  predicted to her that the one who would lead her to her bed for the  last time would not be a King but a citizen executioner, it might have  been--but why moralize?        Robert Arnot        _To the Reader_    _As the early part of Madame du Barry's career had little to  differentiate it from the life of an ordinary courtezan, the editor has  deemed it best to confine the memoirs to the years in her life which  helped to make history._    _--Editor*_          * \"Editor here means the author, who is assuming        the persona of the editor of the Comtesse's memoirs.          CHAPTER I           Letter from Lebel--Visit from Lebel--Nothing conclusive--       Another visit from Lebel--Invitation to sup with the king--       Instructions of the comte Jean to the comtesse    One morning comte Jean entered my apartment, his face beaming with  delight.    \"Read,\" said he, giving me a letter, \"read, Jeannette: victory is ours.  News from Morand. Lebel is coming to Paris, and will dine with us. Are  we alone?\"    \"No, there are two of your countrymen whom you invited yesterday.\"    \"I will write and put them off. Morand alone must dine with Lebel; he  ought to have a place at the feast which he furnishes with such good  music. Come, my dear girl, we touch the moment of importance, it is in  your beauty and power of pleasing that I place all my hopes. I think  I may rely on you; but, above all, do not forget that you are my  sister-in-law.\"    \"Brother-in-law,\" said I, laughing, \"it is not unnecessary that I should  know decidedly to which of family I am married? The custom in France is  not that a woman be the undivided property of three brothers.\"    \"That only happens in Venice,\" replied the comte; \"my brother Elie is  too young, you must be the wife of Guillaume, my second brother.\"    \"Very well; I am the comtesse Guillaume du Barry; that does famously  well; we like to know whom we are married to.\"    After this conversation, comte Jean insisted on presiding at my  toilette. He acquitted himself of the task, with a most laughable  attention. During two good hours, at least, he tormented first  Henriette, and then the female hairdresser, for I had not yet followed  the mode, which began to be very general, of having my hair dressed by a  man. Comte Jean passed alternately from my dressing-room to the kitchen.  He knew Lebel was a gallant and a gourmand, and he was anxious to please  him in all senses at once.    At one o'clock I was under arms, and prepared to receive him on whom  my destiny depended. As soon as I reached the drawing-room, comte Jean  compelled me to submit to the test of a rigid examination.    His serious air amused me much as he gazed at me some time in solemn  silence. At length his forehead relaxed, a smile of satisfaction played  on his lips, and extending his arms to me, without venturing to touch  me, \"You are charming, divine,\" he said; \"Lebel ought to go and hang  himself if he does not fall down at your knees.\"    Soon afterwards the folding-doors were hastily opened, and a servant  announced M. Lebel, _premier de sa Majeste_, with M. Morand. The comte  went to meet the arrivals, and as I now saw Lebel for the first time, he  presented him to me formally.    \"Sister, this is M. Lebel, _premier de sa Majeste _, who has done us the  honor to come and dine with us.\"    \"And he confers a real pleasure on us,\" said I, looking smilingly on M.  Lebel. My look had its effect, for Lebel remained mute and motionless  from admiration at my person. At length he stammered out a few  incoherent words, which I imagined to be compliments. The comte watched  Lebel anxiously, and Morand began to rub his hands, saying:    \"Well, sir, what think you of our celestial beauty?\"    \"She is worthy of a throne,\" replied Lebel, bending his head before  me, and taking my hand, which he pressed respectfully to his lips. This  reply was, perhaps, inadvertently made, but I took it as a good augury.  \"Yes,\" added Lebel, \"you are the most lovely creature I ever met, though  no one is more in the habit of seeing handsome females than myself.\"    \"And of causing them to be seen by others,\" replied comte Jean.    This was an opening which was not followed up by Lebel. His first  enthusiasm having passed, he measured me from head to foot, as if he  would take an accurate description of my person.    For my part I began to support the looks of Lebel with more assurance.  He was a man of no particular \"mark or likelihood,\" but had made  his way. Living at Versailles had given him a certain air of easy  impertinence, but you could not discover anything distinguished in his  manners, nothing which concealed his humble extraction. The direction  of the _Parc aux Cerfs_ gave him much influence with the king, who found  the convenience of such a man, who was willing to take upon himself all  the disagreeable part of his clandestine amours. His duties placed  him in contact with the ministers, the lieutenant of police, and the  comptroller-general. The highest nobility sought his friendship with  avidity. They all had a wife, a sister, a daughter, whom they wished to  make the favorite sultana; and for this it was necessary to get the ear  of Lebel. Thus, under a libertine prince, the destinies of France were  at the mercy of a _valet de chambre_.    I should tell you, however, that I never had occasion but to speak well  of him, and that I have the utmost gratitude for all he did for me. The  attachment he testified on our first meeting has never been altered. He  gave me his protection as far as it was necessary for me, and when the  favor of the king had accorded to me a station, whence all the court  sought to hurl me, Lebel seconded me with all his power in my efforts  to preserve it. I will say, that it is to his vigilance that I owe the  overthrow of more than one conspiracy against me. He was a warm and  sincere friend, and not at all interested in the services he rendered.  He did a great deal of good, as well as harm, in private. I know poor  families whom he has assisted with his own purse, when he could obtain  nothing for them from the king, for Louis was only prodigal in his  pleasures.    However, we dined, and Lebel praised me incessantly to the very skies,  and that with so much warmth, that I was fearful at one time he would  fall in love with me himself, and would not resign me to another. Thank  heaven, Lebel was a faithful servant.    After dinner, when we left the table, Lebel paid me some compliments;  then pulling out his watch, he spoke of an appointment at the Marais,  and left without saying a word of seeing us again.    At this abrupt departure,"]]]
