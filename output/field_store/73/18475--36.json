I shall seek out the Citizeness  Candeille.\"    \"And if she renders you useful assistance, I think I can offer her  what should prove a tempting prize. Women are so vain!\" he added,  contemplating with rapt attention the enamel-like polish on his  finger-nails. \"There is a vacancy in the Maison Moliere. Or--what might  prove more attractive still--in connection with the proposed National  fete, and the new religion for the people, we have not yet chosen  a Goddess of Reason. That should appeal to any feminine mind. The  impersonation of a goddess, with processions, pageants, and the rest...  Great importance and prominence given to one personality.... What  say you, Citizen? If you really have need of a woman for the furtherance  of your plans, you have that at your disposal which may enhance her  zeal.\"    \"I thank you, Citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin calmly. \"I always entertained  a hope that some day the Revolutionary Government would call again on  my services. I admit that I failed last year. The Englishman is  resourceful. He has wits and he is very rich. He would not have  succeeded, I think, but for his money--and corruption and bribery are  rife in Paris and on our coasts. He slipped through my fingers at the  very moment when I thought that I held him most securely. I do admit all  that, but I am prepared to redeem my failure of last year, and... there  is nothing more to discuss.--I am ready to start.\"    He looked round for his cloak and hat, and quietly readjusted the set  of his neck-tie. But Robespierre detained him a while longer: that  born mountebank, born torturer of the souls of men, had not gloated  sufficiently yet on the agony of mind of this fellow-man.    Chauvelin had always been trusted and respected. His services in  connection with the foreign affairs of the Revolutionary Government had  been invaluable, both before and since the beginning of the European  War. At one time he formed part of that merciless decemvirate  which--with Robespierre at its head--meant to govern France by laws of  bloodshed and of unparalleled ferocity.    But the sea-green Incorruptible had since tired of him, then had  endeavoured to push him on one side, for Chauvelin was keen and clever,  and, moreover, he possessed all those qualities of selfless patriotism  which were so conspicuously lacking in Robespierre.    His failure in bringing that interfering Scarlet Pimpernel to justice  and the guillotine had completed Chauvelin's downfall. Though not  otherwise molested, he had been left to moulder in obscurity during this  past year. He would soon enough have been completely forgotten.    Now he was not only to be given one more chance to regain public favour,  but he had demanded powers which in consideration of the aim in  view, Robespierre himself could not refuse to grant him. But the  Incorruptible, ever envious and jealous, would not allow him to exult  too soon.    With characteristic blandness he seemed to be entering into all  Chauvelin's schemes, to be helping in every way he could, for there  was something at the back of his mind which he meant to say to the  ex-ambassador, before the latter took his leave: something which  would show him that he was but on trial once again, and which would  demonstrate to him with perfect clearness that over him there hovered  the all-powerful hand of a master.    \"You have but to name the sum you want, Citizen Chauvelin,\" said the  Incorruptible, with an encouraging smile, \"the government will not stint  you, and you shall not fail for lack of authority or for lack of funds.\"    \"It is pleasant to hear that the government has such uncounted wealth,\"  remarked Chauvelin with dry sarcasm.    \"Oh! the last few weeks have been very profitable,\" retorted  Robespierre; \"we have confiscated money and jewels from emigrant  royalists to the tune of several million francs. You remember the  traitor Juliette Marny, who escape to England lately? Well! her mother's  jewels and quite a good deal of gold were discovered by one of our most  able spies to be under the care of a certain Abbe Foucquet, a calotin  from Boulogne--devoted to the family, so it seems.\"    \"Yes?\" queried Chauvelin indifferently.    \"Our men seized the jewels and gold, that is all. We don't know yet what  we mean to do with the priest. The fisherfolk of Boulogne like him, and  we can lay our hands on him at any time, if we want his old head for  the guillotine. But the jewels were worth having. There's a historic  necklace worth half a million at least.\"    \"Could I have it?\" asked Chauvelin.    Robespierre laughed and shrugged his shoulders.    \"You said it belonged to the Marny family,\" continued the ex-ambassador.  \"Juliette Marny is in England. I might meet her. I cannot tell what may  happen: but I feel that the historic necklace might prove useful. Just  as you please,\" he added with renewed indifference. \"It was a thought  that flashed through my mind when you spoke--nothing more.\"    \"And to show you how thoroughly the government trusts you, Citizen  Chauvelin,\" replied Robespierre with perfect urbanity, \"I will myself  direct that the Marny necklace be placed unreservedly in your hands; and  a sum of fifty thousand francs for your expenses in England. You see,\"  he added blandly, \"we give you no excuse for a second failure.\"    \"I need none,\" retorted Chauvelin drily, as he finally rose from his  seat, with a sigh of satisfaction that this interview was ended at last.    But Robespierre too had risen, and pushing his chair aside he took  a step or two towards Chauvelin. He was a much taller man than the  ex-ambassador. Spare and gaunt, he had a very upright bearing, and  in the uncertain light of the candle he seemed to tower strangely  and weirdly above the other man: the pale hue of his coat, his  light-coloured hair, the whiteness of his linen, all helped to give to  his appearance at that moment a curious spectral effect.    Chauvelin somehow felt an unpleasant shiver running down his spine as  Robespierre, perfectly urbane and gentle in his manner, placed a long,  bony hand upon his shoulder.    \"Citizen Chauvelin,\" said the Incorruptible, with some degree of  dignified solemnity, \"meseems that we very quickly understood one  another this evening. Your own conscience, no doubt, gave you a  premonition of what the purport of my summons to you would be. You say  that you always hoped the Revolutionary Government would give you one  great chance to redeem your failure of last year. I, for one, always  intended that you should have that chance, for I saw, perhaps, just  a little deeper into your heart than my colleagues. I saw not only  enthusiasm for the cause of the People of France, not only abhorrence  for the enemy of your country, I saw a purely personal and deadly hate  of an individual man--the unknown and mysterious Englishman who proved  too clever for you last year. And because I believe that hatred will  prove sharper and more far-seeing than selfless patriotism, therefore I  urged the Committee of Public Safety to allow you to work out your own  revenge, and thereby to serve your country more effectually than any  other--perhaps more pure-minded patriot would do. You go to England  well-provided with all that is necessary for the success of your plans,  for the accomplishment of your own personal vengeance. The Revolutionary  Government will help you with money, passports, safe conducts; it  places its spies and agents at your disposal. It gives you practically  unlimited power, wherever you may go. It will not enquire into your  motives, nor yet your means, so long as these lead to success. But  private vengeance or patriotism, whatever may actuate you, we here in  France demand you deliver into our hands the man who is known in two  countries as the Scarlet Pimpernel! We want him alive if possible,  or dead if it must be so, and we want as many of his henchmen as will  follow him to the guillotine. Get them to France, and we'll know how to  deal with them, and let the whole of Europe be damned.\"    He paused for a while, his hand still resting on Chauvelin's shoulder,  his pale green eyes holding those of the other man as if in a trance.  But Chauvelin neither stirred nor spoke. His triumph left him quite  calm; his fertile brain was already busy with his plans. There was no  room for fear in his heart, and it was without the slightest tremor that  he waited for the conclusion of Robespierre's oration.    \"Perhaps, Citizen Chauvelin,\" said the latter at last, \"you have already  guessed what there is left for me to say. But lest there should remain  in your mind one faint glimmer of doubt or of hope, let me tell you  this. The Revolutionary Government gives you this chance of redeeming  your failure, but this one only; if you fail again, your outraged  country will know neither pardon nor mercy. Whether you return to France  or remain in England, whether you travel North, South, East or West,  cross the Oceans, or traverse the Alps, the hand of an avenging People  will be upon you. Your second failure will be punished by death,  wherever you may be, either by the guillotine, if you are in France, or  if you seek refuge elsewhere, then by the hand of an assassin.    \"Look to it, Citizen Chauvelin! for there will be no escape this time,  not even if the mightiest tyrant on earth tried to protect you, not even  if you succeeded in building up an empire and placing yourself upon a  throne.\"    His thin, strident voice echoed weirdly in the small, close boudoir.  Chauvelin made no reply. There was nothing that he could say. All that  Robespierre had put so emphatically before him, he had fully realised,  even whilst he was forming his most daring plans.    It was an \"either--or\" this time, uttered to HIM now.

The fond-hearted mother had assisted in adjusting upon her son the  \"tow frock and trowsers,\" had tightly secured the knapsack, canteen  and cartridge box in the strings twisted with her own fingers from the  same material as his clothes; as he turned, on opening the door, to  speak the \"manly good-bye,\" she suppressed the parting tear, lest it  might damp the flame of freedom which fired his noble soul, and echoed  the \"good-bye\" with a forced smile.    As she went to the window to take another look, she discovered the  Testament had been forgotten; she caught it in her hand, ran to the  door--called him loudly, holding the book in her uplifted hand, in  order to show him why she stopped, and soon stood by his side. Without  uttering a word she put the book in its place, grasped his hand,  looked him full in the face, and with quivering lips, heart big with  emotion, checks bedewed with tears of maternal affection, she spoke:  \"My son, I would not have you stay; your country has the FIRST claim  upon you; be true to that as you have been dutiful to me, and Heaven  will protect you--KEEP THAT TESTAMENT IN YOUR VEST POCKET, OVER YOUR  HEART!\"    After faithfully serving the term of his enlistment, he returned to  his home. Before he uttered a word, he took from his \"vest pocket\" the  old Testament, and there lay British bullet, snugly imbedded where the  force of the powder had driven it, and this was the only shot he had  received while fighting for his country.--_Nashville Union_.           *       *       *       *       *          TEMPERANCE IN THE ARMY.

He finally took marching orders _t'other  way_.           *       *       *       *       *          MODES OF RAISING PONDEROUS ARTICLES.      A wedge is considered to be the most simple of \"mechanical powers,\"  and is often used in cases where no other apparatus can be made to  apply; as in splitting logs and other adhesive articles. If a massive  rock is to be elevated from the ground, a wedge must first be driven  between that and its foundation, preparatory to the application of  levers. Yet the wedge is in most cases objectionable on account of the  friction with which its use is attended. The next, and most common  power applied for elevating buildings on large rocks, is the simple  lever, commonly called a pry. This usually consists of a long straight  beam or pole, one end of which is placed under the object to be  raised, while a fulcrum consisting of a stone or block of wood, is  placed under the lever, at a short distance from the object to be  raised. The opposite extremity then being forced down by the weight of  one or more of the workmen, a force is applied to the object to be  raised, bearing the same proportion to that applied to the lever, that  the distance between the fulcrum and the extreme end of the lever does  to that between the fulcrum and the object. Levers made of iron, and  simply denominated \"iron bars,\" are commonly used in raising and  removing rocks. A machine called a \"bed-screw\" is frequently used for  elevating buildings. It originally consisted principally of a large  vertical screw, which was placed on a foundation called the \"bed,\" and  was turned by levers; but many improvements and variations have been  added, till, in some instances, the screw has been dispensed with, and  a rack and pinion have been substituted. Some of the best in use  consist of a vertical iron rack, which is occasionally forced upward  by the teeth of a pinion: a geer wheel on the same axle with the  pinion being driven by the thread of a horizontal screw, to the head  of which is attached a crank. By a machine of this construction,  properly proportioned, one man may raise about twenty tons weight.  Vertical screws, turned by levers, have been frequently used for the  purpose of raising vessels to repair. But in these cases a large  portion of the power applied is lost in the friction of the screw, and  the process is laborious and tedious. This is probably the most  awkward and injudicious method that has been applied to that purpose.  Another method which has been applied to the purpose of elevating  vessels, is decidedly ridiculous, although less laborious than the  former. It is called the \"hydraulic power,\" and consists in forcing  water into large cylinders, by forcing pumps which are operated by  steam power; while the water thus forced into the cylinder moves a  piston and piston-rod, to which is connected several stout chains,  which passing over corresponding pulleys, descend to a platform, on  which rests the vessel to be raised. An expensive apparatus, called  the \"Marine Railway,\" constructed on the principle of the _inclined  plane_, with a huge and complicated carriage to travel thereon, has  been extensively used for taking vessels out of the water to repair.  This plan is objectionable, however, on several accounts. It requires  the application of a great quantity of power to overcome the friction  of its many axles and machinery, in addition to what is requisite to  overcome the gravity of the vessel. It is, moreover, injurious to the  vessels which are taken up thereby, on account of its elevating the  forward part, before the centre and stern become seated on the  carriage. The most judicious mode in present use, for raising vessels  to repair, and which must be preferred to all others, where there is a  supply of water from an elevated reservoir, is on the principle of  locks; the vessel being floated into one apartment, is elevated by the  induction of water from above, till it can be floated over an elevated  platform, where it is left at rest, while the water is allowed to pass  off below. The sides of this upper box or apartment, are moveable,  being attached to the bottom or platform by hinge joints, so that they  may be let down to a horizontal position, thus giving the workmen the  advantage of light and convenience. The \"dry dock\" in the Navy Yard at  Charlestown, Mass., is constructed awkwardly enough; but as the  vessels at that place are not _raised_, it does not come under this  head. The massive stones which were used in the construction of some  of the ancient edifices, were evidently raised by inclined planes. A  huge mound of earth was built up round the building, completely  enclosing it; and the elevation of the mound kept pace with that of  the edifice: thus giving the laborers a chance to roll up the stones  to their places. They used no other mechanical power than the simple  windlass and lever; and no other carriage than a drag, under which was  placed rollers. When the building was completed, the earth was taken  away, and levelled about the vicinity. The modern method of raising  stones for building, and which is now used in the building of heavy  stone edifices, is by the"]]]
