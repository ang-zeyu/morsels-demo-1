As it is, you will have to be careful; fellows of this kind are  not of a forgiving nature, and will be patient enough to wait for their  revenge, but sooner or later they will attempt to take it.\"    \"It was so dark, father, that they can scarcely have seen my face.\"    \"Perhaps not, but no doubt they were able to make out your figure, and  there are very few better-class young Europeans here. You will have to  be on your guard, lad; you had better always carry pistols with you.  Clever as you may be with your fists, if you were attacked by  half-a-dozen fellows with knives, you would stand but little chance with  them. Don't be out after dusk; in daylight you are fairly safe. At any  rate, you would be, if you avoid the rookeries, where the lower class of  European inhabitants live. I have a brace of short-barrelled pistols  up-stairs I will give you. I carried them at one time when things were  very unsettled here. You have made two bitter enemies, but, on the other  hand, you have made a friend who may be useful. These Arabs, when they  once form a friendship, are as true as steel, and in the event of any  fanatical troubles here, you would find a sure refuge among them. The  lad's father, Aboo Ben Ouafy, I know a little of, as he has made  purchases of me. His tribe is not a large one, but he himself is a fine  fellow. As the lad told you, their head-quarters are in an oasis some  eight or ten miles, I believe, east of the old site of Lake Mareotis.  They, of course, like all those people, are frequently absent on hunting  or plundering expeditions.\"    The next day Sidi and his father, followed by half a dozen tribesmen,  halted in front of Mr. Blagrove's place of business, and the two former  dismounted and entered. The Bedouin chief saluted the merchant gravely,  while Sidi went up to Edgar, who was sitting at a table, for he now  worked for some hours a day in his father's office, and who rose at the  lad's approach, and held out his hand in English fashion.    \"You are none the worse for our scrimmage last night, Sidi?\" he said  heartily.    \"No harm was done,\" Sidi replied gravely. \"I am glad of what happened,  for it has given me a friend, a brother.\"    \"I am glad too,\" Edgar replied, \"for I too am happy to have gained a  friend.\"    In the meantime his father was saying to Mr. Blagrove, \"I have come,  effendi, to thank you and your son for the assistance he rendered to my  boy yesterday. I have no doubt that he saved his life, and that at the  peril of his own. It is wonderful what my son tells me, that, with his  hands alone he beat to the ground the two men who had attacked him,  though they were armed with knives. I know not how it could be done, but  since it was done 'tis plain that he must possess skill unknown to us.  Sidi has called him brother, and henceforth I shall regard him as a son,  and my tribe will be his should he need their services. I doubt not that  the attack was made in order to gain the horse my son rode, which is one  of famous breed, and would sell at high price at Cairo or any other of  the large towns. I feel sure that they would have killed him in order  that they might carry the horse away without search being made for it,  for before we found that Sidi had been slain the horse would have been a  hundred miles away.\"    \"I know that your tribe is famous for having some of the best Arabian  blood in the country, sheik, and I think it probable that you are right.  The fellows may have seen your son ride into the town and determined to  waylay him on his return.\"    \"Your son did wrong not to kill them,\" the Arab said, \"he will be in  danger from them. I have called not only to thank him, but to ask him to  come and bide with us for a time; he will assuredly be in danger here.  Were I governor of the town I would chop off the heads of all those  people who breed disorders and are a curse to it. 'Tis well that Franks  like yourself should settle among us, and should trade with us, buying  our goods and selling to us those of Europe, but these thieves and  cut-throats, these ruffians who neither trade nor work, but live by  ill-doing, should be rooted out.\"    \"I should be glad for my son to stay with you for a short time, sheik. I  share your opinion that these men will try to avenge themselves, and it  were well that he should be away for a time. Doubtless they will watch  narrowly to see if they can find the young fellow who interfered with  them, but if they meet with no one like him they may well think that he  has left the town.\"    \"It is well!\" the Arab said. \"I am going now to the governor to lay a  complaint against these men. My son will go with me to tell him what  they are like; the son of a sheik is not to be assaulted by town  ruffians with impunity. We may be kept some time, but when we have done  we will return hither. Will your son be ready to ride with us?\"    \"Certainly, sheik; it will not take him five minutes to make his  preparations.\"    \"He will not need a horse,\" the sheik said; \"I have brought one with me  for him.\"    Edgar had listened with delight to this conversation (which was in  Arabic, which his father spoke fluently). The idea of going to stay for  a time in an Arab encampment was exciting indeed, for he had already  begun to find the life monotonous after the two years spent at school  and in the lively companionship of his cousins.    \"It were well that you should come out and see your horse,\" the sheik  said to him, \"and make friends with him while we are away, for he is not  accustomed to Europeans, and might give you trouble were you to mount  him at once.\"    Edgar and his father both went out. One of the Arabs was standing at  the horse's head, rubbing its nose and talking to it as if it had been a  human being.    \"That is the horse,\" the sheik said gravely. \"Only to one, whom I regard  as a son, would I part with him. On his back you may scoff at pursuit by  any foes, for outside my encampment there is not a horse in Egypt which  it could not distance. Now it is yours to do with as you like, save to  sell it, for I would not that his blood should run in any veins save  those of the horses of my tribe.\"    \"This is, indeed, a princely gift, sheik,\" the merchant said warmly.  \"'Tis a noble horse, and one that a king might ride. My son is indeed  indebted to you, and will value it beyond all price.\"    Edgar was warm in his expressions of gratitude and admiration, although,  indeed, he was unable to appreciate at its full value the points of the  animal. It was a gray, and, to English eyes, would have looked light and  wanting in bone, and fit rather for a lady's use than for a man's, with  its slender limbs and small head; but one accustomed to Arab horses, as  Mr. Blagrove was, could see at once that it was of the purest strain and  highest breeding.    \"Come with me,\" the sheik said to Edgar. \"At present, you see, he is not  accustomed to your white face, but he will soon come to love you, and  answer to your call.\"    The horse, indeed, had laid back his ears, distended his dilated  nostrils, and stepped back a foot or two; but as the sheik approached it  gave a little whinny of pleasure, and, advancing, laid its muzzle  against his cheek.    \"This is your new master, Beauty,\" he said, as he stroked its glossy  neck. \"He will keep you well, and you will be as one of his children,  and you must be a good friend and servant to him.\"    Edgar now stroked the animal. A quiver as of fear ran through it as he  touched it, but as he continued, this died away; and as Edgar spoke  quietly to it in Arabic, it was not long before it responded to his  caresses, and after taking a good look at him with its soft liquid eyes,  it put its head on his shoulder.    \"You are friends now,\" the sheik said, with a tone of pleasure. \"It is  to few, even of my tribesmen, whom he would give such a greeting. He  recognizes you already as his friend. Give him a handful of sweetmeats,  and the bargain will be sealed.\"    The merchant at once sent one of the native boys out to buy a bag of  sweetmeats. The sheik waited until he saw the horse taking these out of  Edgar's hands and munching them contentedly, then, leaving one of his  tribesmen in charge of the horse, he mounted, and rode off with his son  and the rest of his followers. Edgar stood for some time talking to the  horse, and then, leaving it to the native, went into the house to make  his preparations for the journey.    \"You have, indeed, done well for yourself, Edgar,\" his father said as he  came in. \"'Tis in every way fortunate. The Turks love us little, and  though they put up with us, as they need the goods that we sell, still  there may at any moment be a fanatical rising, and it is well, indeed,  to have made friends with one of the desert tribes, among whom you can  find a safe refuge. You little know the value of the horse he has given  you. The breed is a famous one, and the sheik has been offered a  fabulous sum for one of his steeds, but nothing could tempt him to part  with one. An Arab prizes a valuable horse beyond all his earthly  possessions, and, save under the pressure of the direst want, nothing  could persuade him to part with it. In presenting it to you, therefore,  the chief has shown his friendship in the most striking manner  possible, and that he regards you, as he says, as one of his family.\"          CHAPTER II.    A BEDOUIN TRIBE.      It was two hours before the sheik returned.    \"We have been fortunate,\" he said, as Mr. Blagrove and Edgar came out  into the court-yard as he entered. \"The men have had their punishment.  The governor, after hearing my story, sent to the head of the police,  and charged him to take four men down with him into the quarter where  men of this sort are generally to be found. When my son described the  men to him, and said that he thought that one of them was a Maltese  named Giaccamo, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],[0,"Steve and the Steam Engine (#4)"],[1,"boy waiting on the  doorstep harbored a thought of anything but anticipation in the prospect  of the coming holiday.    \"Is everything in, Steve?\" asked his father, approaching with Doris's  remaining grip.    \"I think so, Dad,\" was the reply. \"It certainly seems as if I had piled  in almost a dozen suitcases.\"    \"Nonsense, Stevie,\" pouted Doris. \"There were only four.\"    \"Five, Miss Sophomore!\" contradicted her brother. \"Five! That one Dad is  bringing makes the fifth, and I would be willing to bet that it is  yours.\"    \"That's where you are wrong, Smartie,\" the girl laughed good-humoredly,  making a mischievous grimace at him from beneath the brim of her saucy  little toque of blue velvet. \"I am not guilty of the extra suitcase.  It's mother's.\"    \"Your mother's!\" ejaculated Mr. Tolman incredulously. \"Mercy on us! I  never knew your mother to be starting out on a short trip with such an  array of gowns.\" Then turning toward his wife, he added in bantering  fashion: \"Aren't you getting a little frivolous, my dear? If it were  Doris now--\"    \"But it isn't this time!\" interrupted the young lady triumphantly.    Her mother exchanged a glance with her and they both laughed.    \"No, Henry, I am the one to blame,\" Mrs. Tolman admitted. \"You see, if I  am to keep pace with my big son and daughter I must look my best; so I  have not only brought the extra suitcase but I am going to be  tremendously fussy as to where it is put.\"    \"I do believe Mater's brought all her jewels with her!\" Steve declared  wickedly. \"Well, she shall have her sunbursts, tiaras, and things where  she can keep her eye on them every moment. Suppose I put them down here  at your feet, Mother.\"    Without further ado, he started to lift the basket suitcase into the  car.    \"Don't tip it up, son. Don't tip it up!\" cautioned his mother.    \"Your mother is afraid of knocking some of the pearls or emeralds out of  their setting,\" chuckled Mr. Tolman. \"Go easy, Steve!\"    A general laugh arose as the offending piece of baggage was stowed away  out of sight. An instant later wraps and rugs were bundled in, everybody  was cosily tucked up, and Mr. Tolman placed his hands on the wheel.    \"Now we're off, Dad!\" cried Stephen, as he sprang in beside his father.  Mr. Tolman needed no second bidding.    There was a whir, a leap forward, and the automobile glided down the  long avenue and out into the highway.    Steve, studying the road map, was too much interested in tracing out the  route they were to follow to notice that after the car had spun along  smoothly for several miles its speed lessened, and it was not until it  came to a complete standstill that he aroused himself from his  preoccupation sufficiently to see that his father was bending forward  over the starter.    \"What's wrong, Henry?\" inquired his wife from the back seat.    \"I can't imagine,\" was the impatient reply. \"Had I not left the tank  with gasoline in it, I should say it was empty; but of course that  cannot be the case, for I always keep enough in it to carry us to the  garage. Otherwise we should be stalled at our own doorstep and not able  to get anywhere.\"    Climbing out, he began to unscrew the metal top of the tank while  Stephen watched him in consternation.    The boy did not need to hear the result of the investigation for already  the wretched truth flashed upon him. The tank was empty; of course it  was! He knew that without being told. Had not the workman who had  replenished it Wednesday said quite plainly that there was only enough  gas in it to get him home to Coventry? He should have remembered to stop  at the garage and take on an extra supply on the way back as his father  always did. How stupid he had been! In his haste to get home he had  forgotten every other consideration and the present dilemma was the  result of his thoughtlessness. Yet how could he have stopped at the  Coventry garage even had he thought of it? All the men there knew him  and his father, and if he had gone there or had even driven through the  center of the town somebody would have been sure to see him and mention  the incident. Why, it was to avoid this very danger that he had returned  by the less frequented way.    The man in the brown jeans had certainly calculated to a nicety when he  measured out that gasoline. He had not meant him to do any more riding  that day; that was apparent. What business was it of his, anyway, and  why was he so solicitous as to where he went? There was something  puzzling about that man. Steve had thought so at the time. Not that it  mattered now. All that did matter was that here they were stalled at the  side of the road in almost the same spot where he had been stalled the  other day; and they were there because he had neglected to procure  gasoline.    The lad felt the hot blood throb in his cheeks. Again the chance for  confession confronted him and again his tongue was tied. In a word he  could have explained the whole predicament; but he did not. Instead he  sat as if stunned, the heart inside him pounding violently. He saw that  his father was not only deeply annoyed but baffled to solve the  incident.    \"The gas is all out; that's the trouble!\" he announced.    \"What are we going to do, Dad?\" inquired Doris anxiously.    \"Oh, we can get more all right, daughter,\" returned her father  reassuringly. \"Don't worry, my dear. But what I can't understand is how  we come to be in such a plight.\"    \"Doesn't gasoline evaporate, Henry?\" suggested Mrs. Tolman.    \"To some extent, yes; but there could be no such shrinkage as this  unless there was a leak in the tank. I never dreamed the supply was so  low. Well, it is my own fault. I should have made sure everything was  right before we started.\"    Steve shifted his position uncomfortably. He was manly enough not to  enjoy hearing his father shoulder blame that did not rightfully belong  to him.    \"Now let me think what we had better do,\" went on Mr. Tolman.  \"Unfortunately there isn't a house in sight from which we can telephone  for help; and we are fully five miles from Torrington. Our only hope is  that some one bound for the town may overtake us and allow Steve to ride  to the village for aid.\"    \"Couldn't I walk it, Dad?\" asked the boy, with an impulse to make good  the mischief he had done.    \"Oh, no; I wouldn't do that unless the worst befalls,\" his father  replied kindly. \"We should gain nothing. It is a long tramp and would  simply be a waste of time. Let us wait like Mr. Micawber, and see if  something does not turn up.\"    Wretchedly Stephen settled back into his seat. He would rather have  walked to Torrington, done almost anything rather than remain there in  the quiet autumn stillness and listen to the accusations of his  conscience. What a coward he was!    \"It is a shame for us to be tied up here!\" he heard Doris complain.    \"I know it, daughter, and I am as sorry as you are,\" responded her  father patiently. \"In fact, probably, I am more sorry, since it is  through my own carelessness that we are stranded.\"    Again the impulse to blurt out the truth and take the blame that  belonged to him took possession of Stephen; but with resolution he  forced it back. Nervously he fingered the road map. If he had only  spoken at the beginning! It was harder now. He should have made a clean  breast of the whole affair when his father got home from New York. Then  was the time to have done it. But since he had let that opportunity pass  it was awkward, almost absurd, to make confession now. He would much  better keep still.    In the meanwhile a gradual depression fell upon the occupants of the  car. Mrs. Tolman did not speak; Doris subsided into hushed annoyance;  and Mr. Tolman began to pace back and forth at the side of the road and  anxiously scan the stretch of macadam that narrowed away between the  avenue of trees bordering the highway. Presently he uttered an  exclamation of relief.    \"Here comes a truck!\" he cried. \"We will tip the driver and persuade him  to let you ride on to Torrington with him, Steve. This is great luck!\"    Stepping into the pathway of the approaching car he held up his hand and  the passer-by came to a stop beside him.    Stephen looked up expectantly; then a thrill of foreboding seized him  and he quickly turned his head aside. It needed no second glance to  assure him that the man whom his father was addressing was none other  than the workman in the brown jeans who had rescued him from his former  plight. He bent lower over the road map, trying to conceal his face and  decide what to do. In another moment the teamster would probably  recognize him, recall the incident of their former meeting, and hailing  him as an old acquaintance, relate the entire story. The possibility was  appalling, but terrible as it was it did not equal the disquietude he  experienced when he heard his father ejaculate with sudden surprise:    \"Why, if it isn't O'Malley! I did not recognize you, Jake. You are just  in time to extricate us from a most inconvenient situation. We are  headed for Northampton and find ourselves without gasoline. If you can  take my son along to Torrington with you so he can hunt up a garage and  ride back with some one on a service car I shall be very grateful to  you.\"    \"I'd be glad to go myself, sir.\"    \"No, no! I shall not allow you to do that,\" protested Mr. Tolman. \"You  are on your way to work and I could not think of detaining you. All I  ask is that you take my boy along to the village.\"    \"I'd really be pleased to go, sir,\" reiterated O'Malley. \"I am in no  great rush.\"    \"No, I shan't hear to it, Jake,\" Mr. Tolman repeated. \"Nevertheless I  appreciate your offer. Take the boy along and that is all I'll ask.  Come, Steve, jump aboard! O'Malley, son, is one of our railroad people,  whose services we value highly. He is going to be good enough to let you  ride over to Torrington with him.\"    Although the introduction compelled"]]]
