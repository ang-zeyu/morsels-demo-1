You know how deceitful she is and what unkind things she said  about me.\"    \"I'm not standing up for her,\" contradicted Muriel, but her tones  lacked force. \"I only felt a little bit sorry for her. She looked ready  to cry all the afternoon. I think she went home early to avoid meeting  us.\"    \"That proves she is a coward,\" was the triumphant retort. \"Remember----\"  With a sudden swift movement she rose on tiptoe and, drawing the Picture  Girl's head to the level of her mouth, whispered something to her. The  fair-haired girl looked annoyed, the fat girl openly sulky and the  dimpled girl disapproving. Exchanging significant glances, they walked  on ahead of the other two.    Without the slightest intention of being an eavesdropper, Marjorie had  heard every word of the loud-spoken conversation. Her eyes were fixed in  fascination upon the dark, sharp-featured face so close to the fair,  beautiful one. She suddenly recalled a picture she had once seen called  \"The Evil Genius,\" in which a dark, mocking face peered over the  shoulder of a young man who sat at a table as though in deep thought.  This girl's vivid face bore a slight resemblance to that of the Evil  Genius, and it was not until the end of Marjorie's junior year in  Sanford that this sinister impression faded and disappeared forever.    When the little company had passed on down the street, Marjorie turned  and followed them from a distance. For several blocks her way lay in the  same direction, but as she turned into her own street she swept a last  glance toward the five girls. She wondered whom they had been discussing  so freely. She was vaguely disappointed in the Picture Girl, who seemed  to her independent mind too easily influenced by the Evil Genius.  Marjorie had already begun to think of the small, dark girl as that. She  was glad not to be the girl they had discussed. Then, her thought  changing, a vision of two wet blue eyes and a tear-stained face set in  fluffy yellow curls came to her, and Marjorie knew that she had seen the  object of their discussion. A wave of sympathy for the offender swept  over her. \"I don't believe she could do anything deceitful or horrid,\"  she reflected stoutly. \"Her eyes are as true and as blue as Mary's. I'm  going to like her and be her friend, if she'll let me, for she certainly  seems to need one. I did so want to be friends with the Picture Girl,  but I can't help wishing she had been just a little bit braver.\"    While Marjorie strolled thoughtfully home, deep in her own cogitations,  the five girls, having joined forces again, were discussing her.    \"Did you see that pretty girl standing across from the school as we came  out?\" asked Susan Atwell, the girl with the dimples.    \"Yes,\" returned Irma Linton. \"I noticed her there the other day, too. I  wonder who she can be.\"    \"I don't know,\" said Muriel Harding. \"She is awfully sweet though, and  dresses beautifully. She----\"    \"I know all about her,\" interrupted Geraldine Macy. \"Her father is the  new manager for Preston & Haines. They only moved here from the city  last week. Her name is Dean. That is, her last name. I don't know her  other name.\"    \"I am surprised that you don't know that,\" was the sarcastic comment of  Mignon La Salle, the little dark girl.    \"You needn't be,\" flung back the stout girl. \"There are lots of things I  don't know that I'd like to know. For instance----\"    \"Don't be cross, Jerry,\" interrupted Mignon, hastily. \"I was only  teasing you.\" She cast a peculiar glance at the ruffled Jerry from under  her heavy lashes which the young woman failed to catch. \"Tell us some  more about this new girl. I really didn't pay hardly any attention to  her to-day.\"    \"There isn't anything more to tell that I know of,\" muttered Jerry,  sulkily, her desire to distribute news quite gone. \"Wait until Monday  and see. I know she's going to enter Sanford High and that she's a  freshman.\"    \"Then as freshmen it's our solemn duty to be nice to her and make her  feel at home,\" stated Muriel, seriously.    Mignon La Salle shrugged her thin shoulders. \"Perhaps,\" she said,  without enthusiasm. \"I shall wait until I see her before I decide that.\"    Meanwhile, Marjorie had reached home, and, seated before the library  table, was writing for dear life on the letter she had begun to Mary. So  far she had had nothing to tell her chum regarding the young women who  were to be her classmates. To be sure, what she had seen and heard that  afternoon had amounted to nothing, but the girl who looked like Mary had  set her to longing all over again to be able, just for one afternoon, to  sit side by side on the front steps with her childhood's friend and talk  things over.    \"You can't imagine, Mary,\" she wrote, \"how sorry I felt when I saw that  poor girl crying with your eyes. They were just like yours. I forgot  everything except that she looked like you, and asked her what the  trouble was. Of course, she didn't answer me, but actually ran down the  street. I should have known better, but I felt so terribly sympathetic.  'Terribly' is the only word that expresses it. Right after she had gone  the others began to come out of school, and at last the five girls I  told you about came out. They were all talking at once, but I heard the  horrid, sharp-faced, dark girl say that someone was stingy and deceitful  and a lot of other unpleasant things. I thought the Picture Girl was  going to stand up for the person, but that mean little Evil Genius  wouldn't let her. Then all at once it came to me that it was this Mary  girl they were talking about. It was really this one dark girl who said  most of the mean things. The others just listened to her. At any rate,  I'm going to find out who the Mary girl is and try to be a friend to her  just because she looks like you. Don't imagine I could ever like her  better than you, because you know I couldn't. But it's a true soldier's  duty to stand by his comrades on the firing line, you know, and I am  going to be this girl's freshman comrade, and, if she's one-half as nice  as you, I'll be ready to help her fight her battles.    \"Monday is the great day. I dread it, and yet I am looking forward to  it. I like the outside of the school, but will I like the inside? Mother  is going to the principal's office with me. I hope I sha'n't have to try  a lot of tiresome examinations. I have forgotten everything I ever knew,  and the weather has been too pleasant to study. This is such a pretty  town, with plenty of nice walks. If only you were here it would be quite  perfect. I do hope you can come and visit me at Easter. Must stop now,  as I hear mother calling me. We are going to walk down to meet father.  With my dearest love. Write soon.                                              \"Yours always,                                                       \"Marjorie.\"    Marjorie folded, addressed and stamped her letter, then catching her  hat from the hallrack ran out the front door to overtake her mother who  had walked on ahead.    \"I finished my letter to Mary,\" she held it up for inspection, \"and I've  something to report, Captain.\"    \"I am ready to hear you,\" smiled her mother, as they walked on arm in  arm.    For the second time Marjorie related her little adventure, ending with  her resolve to learn to know and befriend, if necessary, the girl who  looked like Mary. Nor did she have the slightest premonition of how much  this readily-avowed championing of a stranger was to cost her.          CHAPTER IV    SANFORD'S LATEST FRESHMAN      \"Will you tell me the way to the principal's office, please?\"    A clear voice broke in upon the conversation of two girls who had paused  before the broad stairway leading to the second floor of the Sanford  High School for a last word before separating for their morning  recitations.    At the sound of the soft, interrupting voice, which contained a touch of  perplexity in its tones, both girls turned quickly to regard the owner.  They saw an attractive little figure, wearing a dainty blue cloth gown,  which was set off by hand-embroidered cuffs and an open rolling collar  of sheerest white. From under a smart blue hat escaped a wealth of soft,  brown curls, while two brown eyes looked into theirs with an expression  of appeal that brought forth instant reply.    \"Miss Archer's office is the last room on the east side of the  second-floor corridor. I am going there now and shall be glad to show  you the way,\" was the quick response of the taller of the two girls,  accompanied by a cheery smile that warmed Marjorie Dean's heart and made  her feel the least bit less of a stranger in this strange land which she  was about to explore.    \"Thank you,\" she returned gratefully, trying to smile in an equally  friendly manner.    Marjorie's first day of school had begun far from propitiously. She had  not reckoned on making her initial appearance in Sanford High School  alone. It had been planned that her mother should accompany her, but  when Monday morning came, her beloved captain had awakened with a  racking headache, which meant nothing less than lying in bed for a long,  pain-filled day in a darkened room.    Torn between sympathy for her mother and her own disappointment,  Marjorie had experienced a desire to go to her captain's room and cry  her eyes out, but being fashioned of sturdier stuff, she made a  desperate effort to brace up and be a good soldier. This was just  another of those miserable \"vicissitudes\" that no one could foresee. She  must face it without grumbling. Her father had already telephoned for a  physician when she entered her mother's room, and Marjorie put on her  sweetest smile as she kissed her mother and assured her that she didn't  in the least mind going to school alone.    As she followed the young woman up the stairs and down the long corridor  Marjorie felt her heart beat a little faster. Her low spirits of the  early morning "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#4)"],[1," cruelties. But still  such of the army as remained pressed on and on, and then one day, oh,  joyous sight, not far beyond they saw the sea, blue and boundless, and  on its shore, bathed in sunlight, lay \"Genoa, the proud,\" a vision of  fairyland to their dazzled eyes.    Discords were forgotten, songs not sung before for many a tearful day,  rose again on the clear air. Crosses and banners were again uplifted as  of old, and Nicholas was once more prophet and leader, as, forgetful of  the past and its miseries, the army of children stood on the 25th day  of August, at the gates of the city of Genoa, waiting to be admitted.    Bright were the floating banners, proud were the waiting youths, as  Nicholas made his plea:--    \"In the name of Christ and his Holy Cross, admit us, his soldiers to  your city! Grant us rest on our journey, to rescue the Holy Sepulchre  from the hands of the enemy! Men of Genoa, we ask not for  transportation across the sea rolling between us and our goal. On the  morrow God will part that sea that we may go over as on dry land, to  achieve a victory denied to the wise and powerful of the land. Yea, he  has said, 'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained  strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy  and the avenger.' Men of Genoa, open thy gates to us, in the name of  Christ!\"    A large number of dignified Senators, or rulers of the city, heard the  petition of Nicholas, heard it with pity mingled with amusement, and  offered the protection of the city for a week to the deluded youths,  for by that time--so thought the Senators--the youths would discover  their deception and return homeward.    Eagerly did Nicholas and his army accept permission to enter the city  whose streets and palaces were in such sharp contrast to those of their  own homelands, Genoa being at that time at the height of her prosperity  and greatness, but their joyful wonder found its match in that of the  inhabitants, whose astonished eyes saw so many fair-haired children  marching through their city, with banners and crosses carried high,  singing their splendid songs, and full of such grim determination to  rescue the Holy Land, a feat which experienced warriors had failed to  accomplish.    As the children marched through Genoa, changed indeed was the  appearance of their army; of the twenty thousand who had left the banks  of the Rhine under the leadership of Nicholas, there were only seven  thousand remaining now. Of the rest some were on their homeward  journey, some in new homes which they had found by the way, others were  lying in undiscovered graves in forest or on hillsides. Only the  strongest and most resolute of that great army remained, and in  consequence it was the flower of the youth of the Rhinelands, who  entered Genoa, rugged and healthy, though their clothes were worn and  faded, their feet bruised and bleeding, their faces burned by sun and  wind, and their expressions aged and saddened by experience.    The merchants left their desks, the children stopped their play, and  stared in wonderment, the grave nobles were moved to surprise, and the  mothers wiped their eyes as the army of blue-eyed youths marched by.    No sooner had the Senators extended the hospitality of the city to the  youths than they decided to retract it, for three reasons: They were  afraid of the effect on the morals of the city, which might be produced  by the entrance of seven thousand unrestrained boys--also they feared  that such a sudden addition to the population might produce a famine,  for situated as Genoa was, there was never any too great a quantity of  food. Also, most weighty reason of all, the German Emperor was at war  with the Pope and in the contest, Genoa was on the Guelph, or papal  side. To shelter German children then, even though on a Crusade, would  be to harbour foes and to care for a hated race which the Pope had  declared outlawed.    In consequence of these reasons the children were told that they could  stay only one night in the city, after all, except those who desired to  make it their permanent home, and abandoning their wild scheme, promise  to become good citizens.    But the youths laughed scornfully in answer--saying:    \"We only _ask_ to rest one night. To-morrow you shall see how God  cares for his army! Who would remain here, when there lies a path in  the sea, between emerald walls, to the land where glory waits us?\"    So saying they slept that night, in proud and peaceful hope of the  morning's glory, and in the morning rushed early to the shore, that  they might see the path across which they were to journey to the  promised land. Alas for hopes and promises and visions! The blue waves  rippled--the sea rolled on. Hours wore away and yet no path was cleared  through the depths, night all too soon came on, and there was no  alternative for the army but to leave the city, and then decide upon  their next step. Some of the children awoke to the deception of that  undivided sea and resolved to stay in Genoa under the conditions  imposed by the Senators, for the comforts of the city appealed strongly  to them after such hardships as they had experienced.    But on that day, Sunday, August 26th, the remainder of the army which  had so proudly and happily entered the city on the day before, went  from its gates with hanging heads and sad hearts--a crestfallen band.  Outside the city walls they gathered in a field near by, to discuss  their plans for the future. Was it wiser to stay and perhaps die in  sunny Italy, than to lose their lives on the weary journey separating  them from their homes?    One cheery lad made answer, \"Are there no other cities which will give  us shelter? Why think that Genoa was meant to be the place at which the  way through the sea was to be made? Let us push on to the southward  until we find the passage which God has promised!\"    His courage was contagious, as courage always is, and the diminished  band decided to press on still further, until God should show his sign.  This resolve made, all turned to Nicholas for his approval of their  decision, and so intense had been their excitement during the  discussion of their plans that no one had noticed that their leader was  no longer one of the group. Alas, for his consecration to a sacred  calling, Nicholas was not to be found, either then or later! Their  leader, who had led them on to glory, where was he? No one ever knew.  Never again was Nicholas seen by any one of those comrades who had  followed him so far and so faithfully, trusted him so fully, and barest  surmise fills in the mystery of his disappearance.    Nicholas was no high-strung, emotional boy, carried away, as was  Stephen, by the glory of his holy calling, he was a calm quiet lad,  who, once impressed with the fact that there was work for him to do,  always did it to the best of his ability, but always with a keen  businesslike instinct of serving his own interests to the best  advantage. His father had impressed upon him the glory and rewards  which would come to him as leader of a victorious Crusade, and Nicholas  had responded to the call.    Now defeat had come instead, and he, the leader of the army, must bear  the brunt of the disgrace which would weigh heavily upon his shoulders  as long as his life lasted,--of that he felt sure. His comrades were as  competent to press on, or to journey homeward without him as under his  leadership. So he argued with himself and even as he argued, yielded to  a great temptation, and like Esau, sold his honour for a mess of  pottage.    A nobleman of Genoa, who was rich and powerful, and who saw in the lad  a resemblance to his long lost son sought Nicholas secretly, and  offered tempting prospects of a home and such advantages as the lad had  never dreamed of having in all his simple life, if he would abandon his  leadership and forsake his army, and Nicholas yielded to temptation.  With careful strategy he slid away from that little group of  disheartened followers, feverishly discussing what was best to do, and  all that flock who had trusted him so fully, mourned for him, and  mourning, trusted still, accounting him as one whom the Lord God of  Hosts had for some wise reason taken from them.    And even while they were mourning for him as for one dead, Nicholas in  new garments, more rich and showy than any he had ever worn before, was  being shown the wonders of his new home, where servants stood ready to  do his bidding, where every article of furnishing was a miracle of  fairy fashioning, where cultured voices spoke in gentle tones, and  where, oh, rapture far beyond all else, in the near-by stable there  stood a prancing steed that was to be his own. Truly a worthy Crusade  leader, he--Nicholas, the German lad!    Without a leader now, and without discipline or regulations, the  discouraged, disorganised band whom he had deserted, bravely started on  again, and reached Pisa, where they had far kinder treatment than in  Genoa, and from which place two shiploads of them sailed for the Holy  Land, but which we have no record that they ever reached. Those who did  not embark, broke up into various small bands and straggling groups,  travelling still southward, and at last reached Rome where they told  their piteous tale to the authorities, who granted them an audience  with the Pope.    Kneeling before him, they told in graphic words the story of their  wanderings and sufferings and discouragements, to which unmoved the  Pope listened, then, praising their zeal, he commanded them to make no  further attempt to reach Palestine, telling them of the hopelessness of  the undertaking. But he added, that the cross of a Crusader once  assumed, bound one for ever to the Holy Cause, and that when they were  older they must fight again for the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre,  whenever he should call them to do so.    This bound the children to a repetition of"]]]
