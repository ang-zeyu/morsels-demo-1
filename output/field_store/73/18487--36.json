Et hic motus quoniam in eandem semper plagam cum vi generatrice  determinatur, si corpus antea movebatur, motui ejus vel conspiranti  additur, vel contrario subducitur, vel obliquo oblique adjicitur, & cum eo  secundum utriusq; determinationem componitur.

Si corpus aliquod in corpus  aliud impingens, motum ejus vi sua quomodocunq; mutaverit, idem quoque  vicissim in motu proprio eandem mutationem in partem contrariam vi alterius  (ob æqualitatem pressionis mutuæ) subibit. His actionibus æquales fiunt  mutationes non velocitatum sed motuum, (scilicet in corporibus non aliunde  impeditis:) Mutationes enim velocitatum, in contrarias itidem partes factæ,  quia motus æqualiter mutantur, sunt corporibus reciproce proportionales.

Nam quoniam vis N agit secundum lineam AC ipsi BD parallelam,  hæc vis nihil mutabit velocitatem accedendi ad lineam illam BD a vi altera  genitam.

Quoniam nihil refert utrum filorum puncta K, L, D affixa sint vel non  affixa ad planum rotæ, pondera idem valebunt ac si suspenderentur a punctis  K & L vel D & L. Ponderis autem A exponatur vis tota per lineam AD, & hæc  resolvetur in vires AC, CD, quarum AC trahendo radium OD directe a centro  nihil valet ad movendam rotam; vis autem altera DC, trahendo radium DO  perpendiculariter, idem valet ac si perpendiculariter traheret radium OL  ipsi OD æqualem; hoc est idem atq; pondus P, quod sit ad pondus A ut vis DC  ad vim DA, id est (ob similia triangula ADC, DOK,) ut OK ad OD seu OL.  Pondera igitur A & P, quæ sunt reciproce ut radii in directum positi OK &  OL, idem pollebunt & sic consistent in æquilibrio: (quæ est proprietas  notissima Libræ, Vectis & Axis in Peritrochio:) sin pondus alterutrum sit  majus quam in hac ratione, erit vis ejus ad movendam rotam tanto major.    Quod si pondus p ponderi P æquale partim suspendatur silo Np, partim  incumbat plano obliquo pG: agantur pH, NH, prior horizonti, posterior plano  pG perpendicularis; & si vis ponderis p deorsum tendens, exponatur per  lineam pH, resolvi potest hæc in vires pN, HN. Si filo pN perpendiculare  esset planum aliquod pQ secans planum alterum pG in linea ad horizontem  parallela; & pondus p his planis pQ, pG solummodo incumberet; urgeret illud  hæc plana viribus pN, HN perpendiculariter, nimirum planum pQ vi pN &  planum pG vi HN. Ideoque si tollatur planum pQ ut pondus tendat filum,  quoniam filum sustinendo pondus, jam vicem præstat plani sublati, tendetur  illud eadem vi pN, qua planum antea urgebatur. Unde tensio fili hujus  obliqui erit ad tensionem fili alterius perpendicularis PN, ut pN ad pH.  Ideoq; si pondus p sit ad pondus A in ratione quæ componitur ex ratione  reciproca minimarum distantiarum filorum suorum AM, pN a centro rotæ, &  ratione directa pH ad pN; pondera idem valebunt ad rotam movendam, atq;  adeo se mutuo sustinebunt, ut quilibet experiri potest.    Pondus autem p planis illis duobus obliquis incumbens, rationem habet cunei  inter corporis fissi facies internas: & inde vires cunei & mallei  innotescunt: utpote cum vis qua pondus p urget planum pQ sit ad vim, qua  idem vel gravitate sua vel ictu mallei impellitur secundum lineam pH in  plano, ut pN ad pH; atq; ad vim qua urget planum alterum pG ut pN ad NH.  Sed & vis Cochleæ per similem virium divisionem colligitur; quippe quæ  cuneus est a vecte impulsus. Usus igitur Corollarij hujus latissime patet,  & late patendo veritatem ejus evincit, cum pendeat ex jam dictis Mechanica  tota ab Authoribus diversimode demonstrata. Ex hisce enim facile derivantur  vires Machinarum, quæ ex Rotis, Tympanis, Trochleis, Vectibus, radijs  volubilibus, nervis tensis & ponderibus directe vel oblique ascendentibus,  cæterisq; potentijs Mechanicis componi solent, ut & vires Nervorum ad  animalium ossa movenda.    Corol. III.        _Quantitas motus quæ colligitur capiendo summam motuum factorum ad      eandem partem, & differentiam factorum ad contrarias, non mutatur ab      actione corporum inter se._    Etenim actio eiq; contraria reactio æquales sunt per Legem 3, adeoq; per  legem 2, æquales in motibus efficiunt mutationes versus contrarias partes.  Ergo si motus fiunt ad eandem partem, quicquid additur motui corporis  fugientis subducetur motui corporis insequentis sic, ut summa maneat eadem  quæ prius. Sin corpora obviam eant, æqualis erit subductio de motu  utriusq;, adeoq; differentia motuum factorum in contrarias partes manebit  eadem.    Ut si corpus sphæricum A sit triplo majus corpore sphærico B, habeatq; duas  velocitatis partes, et B sequatur in eadem recta cum velocitatis partibus  decem, adeoq; motus ipsius A sit ad motum ipsius B ut sex ad decem;  ponantur motus illis esse partium sex & decem, & summa erit partium  sexdecim. In corporum igitur concursu, si corpus A lucretur motus partes  tres vel quatuor vel quinq; corpus B amittet partes totidem, adeoq; perget  corpus A post reflexionem cum partibus novem vel decem vel undecim; & B cum  partibus septem vel sex vel quinq; existente semper summa partium sexdecim  ut prius. Sin corpus A lucretur partes novem vel decem vel undecim vel  duodecim, adeoq; progrediatur post concursum cum partibus quindecim vel  sexdecim vel septendecim vel octodecim; corpus B amittendo, tot partes quot  A lucratur, vel progredietur cum una parte, amissis partibus novem, vel  quiescet amisso motu suo progressivo partium decem, vel regredietur cum una  parte amisso motu suo & (ut ita dicam) una parte amplius, vel regredietur  cum partibus duabus ob detractum motum progressivum partium duodecim. Atq;  ita summæ motuum conspirantium 15 + 1 vel 16 + 0, differentiæ contrariorum  17 - 1 & 18 - 2 semper erunt partium sexdecim ut ante concursum &  reflexionem. Cognitis autem motibus quibuscum corpora post reflexionem  pergent, invenietur cujusq; velocitas ponendo eam esse ad velocitatem ante  reflexionem ut motus post ad motum ante. Ut in casu ultimo, ubi corporis A  motus erat partium sex ante reflexionem; partium octodecim postea, &  velocitas partium duarum ante reflexionem; invenietur ejus velocitas  partium sex post reflexionem, dicendo, ut motus partes sex ante reflexionem  ad motus partes octodecim postea, ita velocitatis partes duæ ante  reflexionem ad velocitatis partes sex postea.    Quod si corpora vel non Sphærica vel diversis in rectis moventia incidant  in se mutuo oblique, & requirantur eorum motus post reflexionem,  cognoscendus est situs plani a quo corpora concurrentia tanguntur in puncto  concursus; dein corporis utriusq; motus (per Corol. 2.) distinguendus est  in duos, unum huic plano perpendicularem, alterum eidem parallelum: motus  autem paralleli, propterea quod corpora agant in se invicem secundum lineam  huic plano perpendicularem, retinendi sunt iidem post reflexionem atq;  antea, & motibus perpendicularibus mutationes æquales in partes contrarias  tribuendæ sunt sic, ut summa conspirantium & differentia contrariorum  maneat eadem quæ prius. Ex hujusmodi reflexionibus oriri etiam solent motus  circulares corporum circa centra propria. Sed hos casus in sequentibus non  considero, & nimis longum esset omnia huc spectantia demonstrare.

The whole future of the science seemed to be  theirs. The cessation of interest through a too speedy attainment of the  perfection towards which each spurred the other, appeared to be the only  danger it held in store for them. When all at once, a rival stood by  their side--not, indeed, menacing their progress, but threatening to  absorb their popularity.    The rise of Herschel was the one conspicuous anomaly in the astronomical  history of the eighteenth century. It proved decisive of the course of  events in the nineteenth. It was unexplained by anything that had gone  before; yet all that came after hinged upon it. It gave a new direction  to effort; it lent a fresh impulse to thought. It opened a channel for  the widespread public interest which was gathering towards astronomical  subjects to flow in.    Much of this interest was due to the occurrence of events calculated to  arrest the attention and excite the wonder of the uninitiated. The  predicted return of Halley's comet in 1759 verified, after an  unprecedented fashion, the computations of astronomers. It deprived such  bodies for ever of their portentous character; it ranked them as  denizens of the solar system. Again, the transits of Venus in 1761 and  1769 were the first occurrences of the kind since the awakening of  science to their consequence. Imposing preparations, journeys to remote  and hardly accessible regions, official expeditions, international  communications, all for the purpose of observing them to the best  advantage, brought their high significance vividly to the public  consciousness; a result aided by the facile pen of Lalande, in rendering  intelligible the means by which these elaborate arrangements were to  issue in an accurate knowledge of the sun's distance. Lastly, Herschel's  discovery of Uranus, March 13, 1781, had the surprising effect of utter  novelty. Since the human race had become acquainted with the company of  the planets, no addition had been made to their number. The event thus  broke with immemorial traditions, and seemed to show astronomy as still  young and full of unlooked-for possibilities.    Further popularity accrued to the science from the sequel of a career so  strikingly opened. Herschel's huge telescopes, his detection by their  means of two Saturnian and as many Uranian moons, his piercing scrutiny  of the sun, picturesque theory of its constitution, and sagacious  indication of the route pursued by it through space; his discovery of  stellar revolving systems, his bold soundings of the universe, his  grandiose ideas, and the elevated yet simple language in which they were  conveyed--formed a combination powerfully effective to those least  susceptible of new impressions. Nor was the evoked enthusiasm limited to  the British Isles. In Germany, Schroeter followed--_longo intervallo_--in  Herschel's track. Von Zach set on foot from Gotha that general  communication of ideas which gives life to a forward movement. Bode  wrote much and well for unlearned readers. Lalande, by his popular  lectures and treatises, helped to form an audience which Laplace himself  did not disdain to address in the _Exposition du Systeme du Monde_.    This great accession of public interest gave the impulse to the  extraordinarily rapid progress of astronomy in the nineteenth century.  Official patronage combined with individual zeal sufficed for the elder  branches of the science. A few well-endowed institutions could  accumulate the materials needed by a few isolated thinkers for the  construction of theories of wonderful beauty and elaboration, yet  precluded, by their abstract nature, from winning general applause. But  the new physical astronomy depends for its prosperity upon the favour of  the multitude whom its striking results are well fitted to attract. It  is, in a special manner, the science of amateurs. It welcomes the most  unpretending co-operation. There is no one \"with a true eye and a  faithful hand\" but can do good work in watching the heavens. And not  unfrequently, prizes of discovery which the most perfect appliances  failed to grasp, have fallen to the share of ignorant or ill-provided  assiduity.    Observers, accordingly, have multiplied; observatories have been founded  in all parts of the world; associations have been constituted for mutual  help and counsel. A formal astronomical congress met in 1789 at  Gotha--then, under Duke Ernest II. and Von Zach, the focus of German  astronomy--and instituted a combined search for the planet suspected to  revolve undiscovered between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The  Astronomical Society of London was established in 1820, and the similar  German institution in 1863. Both have been highly influential in  promoting the interests, local and general, of the science they are  devoted to forward; while functions corresponding to theirs have been  discharged elsewhere by older or less specially constituted bodies, and  new ones of a more popular character are springing up on all sides.    Modern facilities of communication have helped to impress more deeply  upon modern astronomy its associative character. The electric telegraph  gives a certain ubiquity which is invaluable to an observer of the  skies. With the help of a wire, a battery, and a code of signals, he  sees whatever is visible from any portion of our globe, depending,  however, upon other eyes than his own, and so entering as a unit into a  widespread organisation of intelligence. The press, again, has been a  potent agent of co-operation. It has mainly contributed to unite  astronomers all over the world into a body animated by the single aim of  collecting \"particulars\" in their special branch for what Bacon termed a  History of Nature, eventually to be interpreted according to the  sagacious insight of some one among them gifted above his fellows. The  first really effective astronomical periodical was the _Monatliche  Correspondenz_, started by Von Zach in the year 1800. It was followed in  1822 by the _Astronomische Nachrichten_, later by the _Memoirs_ and  _Monthly Notices_ of the Astronomical Society, and by the host of varied  publications which now, in every civilised country, communicate the  discoveries made in astronomy to divers classes of readers, and so  incalculably quicken the current of its onward flow.    Public favour brings in its train material resources. It is represented  by individual enterprise, and finds expression in an ample liberality.  The first regular observatory in the Southern Hemisphere was founded at  Paramatta by Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane in 1821. The Royal  Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope was completed in 1829. Similar  establishments were set to work by the East India Company at Madras,  Bombay, and St. Helena, during the first third of the nineteenth  century. The organisation of astronomy in the United States of America  was due to a strong wave of popular enthusiasm. In 1825 John Quincy  Adams vainly urged upon Congress the foundation of a National  Observatory; but in 1843 the lectures on celestial phenomena of Ormsby  MacKnight Mitchel stirred an impressionable audience to the pitch of  providing him with the means of erecting at Cincinnati the first  astronomical establishment worthy the name in that great country. On the  1st of January, 1882, no less than one hundred and forty-four were  active within its boundaries.    The apparition of the great comet of 1843 gave an additional fillip to  the movement. To the excitement caused by it the Harvard College  Observatory--called the \"American Pulkowa\"--directly owed its origin;  and the example was not ineffective elsewhere. The United States Naval  Observatory was built in 1844, Lieutenant Maury being its first  Director. Corporations, universities, municipalities, vied with each  other in the creation of such institutions; private subscriptions poured  in; emissaries were sent to Europe to purchase instruments and to  procure instruction in their use. In a few years the young Republic was,  in point of astronomical efficiency, at least on a level with countries  where the science had been fostered since the dawn of civilisation.    A vast widening of the scope of astronomy has accompanied, and in part  occasioned, the great extension of its area of cultivation which our age  has witnessed. In the last century its purview was a comparatively  narrow one. Problems lying beyond the range of the solar system were  almost unheeded, because they seemed inscrutable. Herschel first showed  the sidereal universe as accessible to investigation, and thereby  offered to science new worlds--majestic, manifold, \"infinitely infinite\"  to our apprehension in number, variety, and extent--for future conquest.  Their gradual appropriation has absorbed, and will long continue to  absorb, the powers which it has served to develop.    But this is not the only direction in which astronomy has enlarged, or  rather has levelled, its boundaries. The unification of the physical  sciences is perhaps the greatest intellectual feat of recent times. The  process has included astronomy; so that, like Bacon, she may now be said  to have \"taken all knowledge\" (of that kind) \"for her province.\" In  return, she proffers potent aid for its increase. Every comet that  approaches the sun is the scene of experiments in the electrical  illumination of rarefied matter, performed on a huge scale for our  benefit. The sun, stars, and nebulae form so many celestial laboratories,  where the nature and mutual relations of the chemical \"elements\" may be  tried by more stringent tests than sublunary conditions afford. The laws  of terrestrial magnetism can be completely investigated only with the  aid of a concurrent study of the face of the sun. The solar spectrum  will perhaps one day, by its recurrent modifications, tell us "]]]
