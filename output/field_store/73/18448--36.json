But, since that period, chemistry has undergone so complete a  revolution, that, from an obscure and mysterious art, it is now become a  regular and beautiful science, to which art is entirely subservient. It  is true, however, that we are indebted to the alchemists for many very  useful discoveries, which sprung from their fruitless attempts to make  gold, and which, undoubtedly, have proved of infinitely greater  advantage to mankind than all their chimerical pursuits.    The modern chemists, instead of directing their ambition to the vain  attempt of producing any of the original substances in nature, rather  aim at analysing and imitating her operations, and have sometimes  succeeded in forming combinations, or effecting decompositions, no  instances of which occur in the chemistry of Nature. They have little  reason to regret their inability to make gold, whilst, by their  innumerable inventions and discoveries, they have so greatly stimulated  industry and facilitated labour, as prodigiously to increase the  luxuries as well as the necessaries of life.    EMILY.    But, I do not understand by what means chemistry can facilitate labour;  is not that rather the province of the mechanic?    MRS. B.    There are many ways by which labour may be rendered more easy,  independently of mechanics; but even the machine, the most wonderful in  its effects, the Steam-engine, cannot be understood without the  assistance of chemistry. In agriculture, a chemical knowledge of the  nature of soils, and of vegetation, is highly useful; and, in those arts  which relate to the comforts and conveniences of life, it would be  endless to enumerate the advantages which result from the study of this  science.    CAROLINE.    But, pray, tell us more precisely in what manner the discoveries of  chemists have proved so beneficial to society?    MRS. B.    That would be an injudicious anticipation; for you would not comprehend  the nature of such discoveries and useful applications, as well as you  will do hereafter. Without a due regard to method, we cannot expect to  make any progress in chemistry. I wish to direct your observations  chiefly to the chemical operations of Nature; but those of Art are  certainly of too high importance to pass unnoticed. We shall therefore  allow them also some share of our attention.    EMILY.    Well, then, let us now set to work regularly. I am very anxious to  begin.    MRS. B.    The object of chemistry is to obtain a knowledge of the intimate nature  of bodies, and of their mutual action on each other. You find therefore,  Caroline, that this is no narrow or confined science, which comprehends  every thing material within our sphere.    CAROLINE.    On the contrary, it must be inexhaustible; and I am a loss to conceive  how any proficiency can be made in a science whose objects are so  numerous.    MRS. B.    If every individual substance were formed of different materials, the  study of chemistry would, indeed, be endless; but you must observe that  the various bodies in nature are composed of certain elementary  principles, which are not very numerous.    CAROLINE.    Yes; I know that all bodies are composed of fire, air, earth, and water;  I learnt that many years ago.    MRS. B.    But you must now endeavour to forget it. I have already informed you  what a great change chemistry has undergone since it has become a  regular science. Within these thirty years especially, it has  experienced an entire revolution, and it is now proved, that neither  fire, air, earth, nor water, can be called elementary bodies. For an  elementary body is one that has never been decomposed, that is to say,  separated into other substances; and fire, air, earth, and water, are  all of them susceptible of decomposition.    EMILY.    I thought that decomposing a body was dividing it into its minutest  parts. And if so, I do not understand why an elementary substance is not  capable of being decomposed, as well as any other.    MRS. B.    You have misconceived the idea of _decomposition_; it is very different  from mere _division_. The latter simply reduces a body into parts, but  the former separates it into the various ingredients, or materials, of  which it is composed. If we were to take a loaf of bread, and separate  the several ingredients of which it is made, the flour, the yeast, the  salt, and the water, it would be very different from cutting or  crumbling the loaf into pieces.    EMILY.    I understand you now very well. To decompose a body is to separate from  each other the various elementary substances of which it consists.    CAROLINE.    But flour, water, and other materials of bread, according to our  definition, are not elementary substances?    MRS. B.    No, my dear; I mentioned bread rather as a familiar comparison, to  illustrate the idea, than as an example.    The elementary substances of which a body is composed are called the  _constituent_ parts of that body; in decomposing it, therefore, we  separate its constituent parts. If, on the contrary, we divide a body by  chopping it to pieces, or even by grinding or pounding it to the finest  powder, each of these small particles will still consist of a portion of  the several constituent parts of the whole body: these are called the  _integrant_ parts; do you understand the difference?    EMILY.    Yes, I think, perfectly. We _decompose_ a body into its _constituent_  parts; and _divide_ it into its _integrant_ parts.    MRS. B.    Exactly so. If therefore a body consists of only one kind of substance,  though it may be divided into its integrant parts, it is not possible to  decompose it. Such bodies are therefore called _simple_ or _elementary_,  as they are the elements of which all other bodies are composed.  _Compound bodies_ are such as consist of more than one of these  elementary principles.    CAROLINE.    But do not fire, air, earth, and water, consist, each of them, but of  one kind of substance?    MRS. B.    No, my dear; they are every one of them susceptible of being separated  into various simple bodies. Instead of four, chemists now reckon upwards  of forty elementary substances. The existence of most of these is  established by the clearest experiments; but, in regard to a few of  them, particularly the most subtle agents of nature, _heat_, _light_,  and _electricity_, there is yet much uncertainty, and I can only give  you the opinion which seems most probably deduced from the latest  discoveries. After I have given you a list of the elementary bodies,  classed according to their properties, we shall proceed to examine each  of them separately, and then consider them in their combinations with  each other.    Excepting the more general agents of nature, heat, light, and  electricity, it would seem that the simple form of bodies is that of a  metal.    CAROLINE.    You astonish me! I thought the metals were only one class of minerals,  and that there were besides, earths, stones, rocks, acids, alkalies,  vapours, fluids, and the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.    MRS. B.    You have made a tolerably good enumeration, though I fear not arranged  in the most scientific order. All these bodies, however, it is now  strongly believed, may be ultimately resolved into metallic substances.  Your surprise at this circumstance is not singular, as the decomposition  of some of them, which has been but lately accomplished, has excited the  wonder of the whole philosophical world.    But to return to the list of simple bodies--these being usually found in  combination with oxygen, I shall class them according to their  properties when so combined. This will, I think, facilitate their future  investigation.    EMILY.    Pray what is oxygen?    MRS. B.    A simple body; at least one that is supposed to be so, as it has never  been decomposed. It is always found united with the negative  electricity. It will be one of the first of the elementary bodies whose  properties I shall explain to you, and, as you will soon perceive, it is  one of the most important in nature; but it would be irrelevant to enter  upon this subject at present. We must now confine our attention to the  enumeration and classification of the simple bodies in general. They may  be arranged as follows:    CLASS I.    _Comprehending the imponderable agents, viz._      HEAT or CALORIC,    LIGHT,    ELECTRICITY.    CLASS II.    _Comprehending agents capable of uniting with inflammable bodies, and in  most instances of effecting their combustion._      OXYGEN,    CHLORINE,    IODINE.*        [Footnote *: It has been questioned by some eminent chemists,      whether these two last agents should not be classed among the      inflammable bodies, as they are capable of combining with oxygen,      as well as with inflammable bodies. But they seem to be more      distinctly characterised by their property of supporting      combustion than by any other quality.]    CLASS III.    _Comprehending bodies capable of uniting with oxygen, and, forming with  it various compounds. This class may be divided as follows:_    DIVISION 1.      HYDROGEN, _forming_ water.    DIVISION 2.    _Bodies forming acids._      NITROGEN,    _forming_ nitric acid.    SULPHUR,     _forming_ sulphuric acid.    PHOSPHORUS,  _forming_ phosphoric acid.    CARBON,      _forming_ carbonic acid.    BORACIUM,    _forming_ boracic acid.    FLUORIUM,    _forming_ fluoric acid.    MURIATIUM,   _forming_ muriatic acid.    DIVISION 3.    _Metallic bodies forming alkalies._      POTASSIUM,  _forming_ potash.    SODIUM,     _forming_ soda.    AMMONIUM,   _forming_ ammonia.    DIVISION 4.    _Metallic bodies forming earths._      CALCIUM, _or metal forming_ lime.    MAGNIUM,    _forming_ magnesia.    BARIUM,     _forming_ barytes.    STRONTIUM,  _forming_ strontites.    SILICIUM,   _forming_ silex.

We can let feature producers know that we attach      greater importance to it than ever; but we cannot make it more      explicit or more prominent in a feature than the producers have.      (After all, no convention in the field of dramatic fiction, in any      medium, is stronger or better understood than the convention which      distinguishes hero and villain and makes the first triumph over the      second.)        \"As regards (2), this extends a practice in accordance with which,      since 1952, one or another of the senior women officers of the      Service has been used as a referee, when auditioning officers have      been in doubt about the proper classification and placement of      features.        \"It may be said in summary, then, that the principles, methods, and      practice of the Service are in general commended; that they are in      no respect criticized severely and in no respect without express      qualification; and that the Committee suggests or recommends no new      purpose, no new method, but only the closer application of methods      already well tried to a purpose which events have made weightier      and more urgent.        \"Nevertheless, it has appeared to be desirable to consider what      action could and should be taken in accordance with what appears to      be the spirit of the Committee's comments and recommendations on      Broadcasting rather than with their letter. This has been done, and      in what follows I wish to offer some comments and explanations, to      review action taken as soon as the report was available and later      decisions now being carried out, and to ask for further direction.\"            \"_Action: Immediate and Continuing:_            \"(i) After the report had been studied Station Managers and          other responsible officers were asked to take interim action to          ensure that the spirit of the Committee's conclusions in regard          to a certain type of song was reflected in their programmes.          They were also asked to let us know, with reasons, of any          serial features running at their stations which they think          should be considered for withdrawal or later time placement.            \"(ii) Two married women of senior status on our staff have been          selected to sit in alternation on the Standard Recordings          Purchasing Committee and the Features Purchasing Committee.          They will not be able to hear with every auditioning officer          all episodes of features or all single recordings of songs. To          duplicate auditioning staff for this purpose would require the          full-time service of five or six married women. Either one,          however, will with the Committee study reports, agreeing to          acceptance or rejection, and help to guide auditioning and          purchasing policy. Doubtful cases brought up by auditioning          officers will be heard by them as well as by other senior          officers.            \"(iii) The time allotted to features classified as suitable for          playing when large audiences of children may be expected to be          listening has been from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.; it is now to be from          4 p.m. to 8 p.m. There may be differences of opinion from time          to time on suitability of features for this classification as          we have a considerable number of public judges of our          decisions, but we shall do our best. All auditioning officers          will be fully alert to their responsibility.            \"(iv) Opportunity was taken at a conference in Wellington at          the end of last month of the senior programme organizers of all          stations throughout the country to discuss fully their          responsibilities towards the matters raised in the Committee's          report. They also discussed the draft of a revised code of          instructions to auditioning officers and others, and this code          is now being circulated.            \"(v) An extension of present procedure on popular song records          was decided upon for Head Office auditioning officers. Records          will be wholly rejected, or passed for general use, or passed          with the reservation that they are to be programmed with          special care (i.e., as to time placement, frequency, etc.).\"            \"The following further action is to be taken:            \"(i) The issue of the code referred to above will give effect          to the Service's desire for the consistent wholesomeness of          programmes, the need to aim constantly to maintain standards in          programmes of all kinds at the highest appropriate level, and          the need to exercise discretion in programming material which          might be rendered objectionable by repetition, inappropriate          time placement, or standard and style of performance.            \"(ii) Some of the dramatic features at present running will be          reauditioned if it is thought that they may be out of tune with          the present atmosphere or the revised time classification. Even          with additional assistance this task may take about six months.          There may be some financial loss if many episodes are to be          discarded or if the withdrawal of episodes or alteration of          time classification creates difficulties in providing          replacement programmes at short notice for sponsors. It is          relevant here to note the difference between ourselves and film          or book censors. After censoring we must ourselves face the          financial result of our actions and the administrative          difficulty of finding substitute and less objectionable          material.            \"(iii) Suppliers of transcribed programmes in Australia are to          be advised of the implications of the report so far as it is          likely to affect our future purchasing policy.            \"There has been a tendency amongst our critics (I do not refer          here to the Committee) to make insufficient allowance for the          considerable part played by broadcasting in serving the public          good in the spheres of information, education, the arts,          and community services. As Sir William Haley, formerly          Director-General of the B.B.C. and now Editor of the _Times_          said in a recent lecture on _The Public Influence of          Broadcasting and the Press_: 'It is, of course, possible to          counter all this by raising one's eyebrows at some of the          variety programmes. They are the other side of the medal. But          one must look at the whole'.\"    Our conclusions as a Committee are as follows:        (1) The officers of the New Zealand Broadcasting Service have      studied in a properly co-operative spirit the suggestions and      recommendations of the Mazengarb Committee, and that        (2) They are alive to the responsibilities that rest upon them as a      Department of State charged with the task of operating a most      important medium of public entertainment, information and      instruction, and that        (3) They have, over the years, worked out for themselves a code of      procedure under which a high and commendable standard of      broadcasting has been, and is being, maintained, and that        (4) They are taking all reasonable and practicable steps to give      effect to the suggestions put forward by the Mazengarb Committee,      and that        (5) We express the hope that the utmost vigilance should be      exercised over the choice, content, and timing of      programmes--especially over those designed for the extended hours      set apart for juvenile listeners--and that every effort be made to      maintain the high standard that the Service has set for itself. We      recommend, too, that during the hours set apart for children there      should be a complete absence of features that can fairly be      regarded as being unsuitable for or injurious to young people.      (_d_) Censoring Authorities    On this point we cite a paragraph from a memorandum placed  before us by the Secretary for the Department of Internal Affairs. It  reads as follows:        \"A further recommendation contained in the report is to the      following effect:            \"'Any Departments concerned with censorship should maintain a          liaison to produce as far as possible a uniform interpretation          of public opinion and taste.'        \"In the view of this Department the objective of the recommendation      is good and should be followed up by appropriate action. There are      several Departments concerned from different angles, and it would      seem that the recommendation could best be implemented by whichever      Department is charged with the general oversight of matters      relating to moral delinquency. It would then be merely a matter of      administrative action for that Department to call periodical      meetings of the appropriate officers concerned with censorship.\"    We, as a Committee, agree with the view expressed above, and  recommend it to the Government for consideration.      (_e_) Department of Education    (i) _Relative Functions of Public Health Nurses and Visiting  Teachers._--The duties of visiting teachers were laid down quite  specifically in an official circular in 1953. Senior officers of the  two Departments discussed the relative functions of public health  nurses and visiting teachers very fully soon after the publication of  the report.
