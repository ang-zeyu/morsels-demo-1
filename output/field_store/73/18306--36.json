The weather, we are told, was exceedingly  cold, the thermometer falling as low as minus 22 deg. F. After speaking of  the various arduous labours the natives are engaged in, Captain Carey  describes the physique and diet of natives in the vicinity of  Niu-Chwang as follows: 'The men accompanying the carts were all very big  and of great strength, and it was obvious that none but exceptionally  strong and hardy men could withstand the hardships of their long march,  the intense cold, frequent blizzards, and the work of forcing their  queer team along in spite of everything. One could not help wondering  what these men lived on, and I found that the chief article was beans,  which, made into a coarse cake, supplied food for both men and animals.  I was told by English merchants who travelled in the interior, that  everywhere they found the same powerful race of men, living on beans and  rice--in fact, vegetarians. Apparently they obtain the needful proteid  and fat from the beans; while the coarse once-milled rice furnishes them  with starch, gluten, and mineral salts, etc. Spartan fare, indeed, but  proving how easy it is to sustain life without consuming flesh-food.'    So far, then, as the physical condition of those nations who are  practically vegetarian is concerned, we have to conclude that practice  tallies with theory. Science teaches that man should live on a non-flesh  diet, and when we come to consider the physique of those nations and men  who do so, we have to acknowledge that their bodily powers and their  health equal, if not excel, those of nations and men who, in part,  subsist upon flesh. But it is interesting to go yet further. It has  already been stated that mind and body are inseparable; that one reacts  upon the other: therefore it is not irrelevant, in passing, to observe  what mental powers are possessed by those races and individuals who  subsist entirely upon the products of the vegetable kingdom.    When we come to consider the mentality of the Oriental races we  certainly have to acknowledge that Oriental culture--ethical,  metaphysical, and poetical--has given birth to some of the grandest and  noblest thoughts that mankind possesses, and has devised philosophical  systems that have been the comfort and salvation of countless millions  of souls. Anyone who doubts the intellectual and ethical attainments of  that remarkable nation of which we in the West know so little--the  Chinese--should read the panegyric written by Sir Robert Hart, who, for  forty years, lived among them, and learnt to love and venerate them as  worthy of the highest admiration and respect. Others have written in  praise of the people of Burma. Speaking of the Burman, a traveller  writes: 'He will exercise a graceful charity unheard of in the West--he  has discovered how to make life happy without selfishness and to combine  an adequate power for hard work with a corresponding ability to enjoy  himself gracefully ... he is a philosopher and an artist.'    Speaking of the Indian peasant a writer in an English journal says: 'The  ryot lives in the face of Nature, on a simple diet easily procured, and  inherits a philosophy, which, without literary culture, lifts his spirit  into a higher plane of thought than other peasantries know of.  Abstinence from flesh food of any kind, not only gives him pure blood  exempt from civilized diseases but makes him the friend and not the  enemy, of the animal world around.'    Eastern literature is renowned for its subtle metaphysics. The higher  types of Orientals are endowed with an extremely subtle intelligence, so  subtle as to be wholly unintelligible to the ordinary Westerner. It is  said that Pythagoras and Plato travelled in the East and were initiated  into Eastern mysticism. The East possesses many scriptures, and the  greater part of the writings of Eastern scholars consist of commentaries  on the sacred writings. Among the best known monumental philosophical  and literary achievements maybe mentioned the _Tao Teh C'hing_; the  _Zend Avesta;_ the _Three Vedas_; the _Brahmanas_; the _Upanishads;_ and  the _Bhagavad-gita_, that most beautiful 'Song Celestial' which for  nearly two thousand years has moulded the thoughts and inspired the  aspirations of the teeming millions of India.    As to the testimony of individuals it is interesting to note that some  of the greatest philosophers, scientists, poets, moralists, and many men  of note, in different walks of life, in past and modern times, have, for  various reasons, been vegetarians, among whom have been named the  following:--      Manu    Zoroaster    Pythagoras    Zeno    Buddha    Isaiah    Daniel    Empedocles    Socrates    Plato    Aristotle    Porphyry    John Wesley    Franklin    Goldsmith    Ray    Paley    Isaac Newton    Jean Paul Richter    Schopenhauer    Byron    Gleizes    Hartley    Rousseau    Iamblichus    Hypatia    Diogenes    Quintus Sextus    Ovid    Plutarch    Seneca    Apollonius    The Apostles      Matthew      James      James the Less      Peter    The Christian Fathers      Clement      Tertullian      Origen      Chrysostom      St. Francis d'Assisi    Cornaro    Leonardo da Vinci    Milton    Locke    Spinoza    Voltaire    Pope    Gassendi    Swedenborg    Thackeray    Linnaeus    Shelley    Lamartine    Michelet    William Lambe    Sir Isaac Pitman    Thoreau    Fitzgerald    Herbert Burrows    Garibaldi    Wagner    Edison    Tesla    Marconi    Tolstoy    George Frederick Watts    Maeterlinck    Vivekananda    General Booth    Mrs. Besant    Bernard Shaw    Rev. Prof. John E. B. Mayor    Hon. E. Lyttelton    Rev. R. J. Campbell    Lord Charles Beresford    Gen. Sir Ed. Bulwer    etc., etc., etc.    The following is a list of the medical and scientific authorities who  have expressed opinions favouring vegetarianism:--      M. Pouchet    Baron Cuvier    Linnaeus    Professor Laurence, F.R.S.    Sir Charles Bell, F.R.S.    Gassendi    Flourens    Sir John Owen    Professor Howard Moore    Sylvester Graham, M.D.    John Ray, F.R.S.    Professor H. Schaafhausen    Sir Richard Owen, F.R.S.

Dr. Robert Perks, M.D., F.R.C.S.    Dr. Kellogg, M.D.    Harry Campbell, M.D.    Dr. Olsen    etc., etc.    Before concluding this section it might be pointed out that the curious  prejudice which is always manifested when men are asked to consider any  new thing is as strongly in evidence against food reform as in other  innovations. For example, flesh-eating is sometimes defended on the  ground that vegetarians do not look hale and hearty, as healthy persons  should do. People who speak in this way probably have in mind one or two  acquaintances who, through having wrecked their health by wrong living,  have had to abstain from the 'deadly decoctions of flesh' and adopt a  simpler and purer dietary. It is not fair to judge meat abstainers by  those who have had to take to a reformed diet solely as a curative  measure; nor is it fair to lay the blame of a vegetarian's sickness on  his diet, as if it were impossible to be sick from any other cause. The  writer has known many vegetarians in various parts of the world, and he  fails to understand how anyone moving about among vegetarians, either in  this country or elsewhere, can deny that such people look as healthy and  cheerful as those who live upon the conventional omnivorous diet.    If a vegetarian, owing to inherited susceptibilities, or incorrect  rearing in childhood, or any other cause outside his power to prevent,  is sickly and delicate, is it just to lay the blame on his present  manner of life? It would, indeed, seem most reasonable to assume that  the individual in question would be in a much worse condition had he not  forsaken his original and mistaken diet when he did. The writer once  heard an acquaintance ridicule vegetarianism on the ground that Thoreau  died of pulmonary consumption at forty-five! One is reminded of Oliver  Wendell Holmes' witty saying:--'The mind of the bigot is like the pupil  of the eye: the more it sees the light, the more it contracts.'    In conclusion, there is, as we have seen in our review of typical  vegetarian peoples and classes throughout the world, the strongest  evidence that those who adopt a sensible non-flesh dietary, suited to  their own constitution and environment, are almost invariably healthier,  stronger, and longer-lived than those who rely chiefly upon flesh-meat  for nutriment.          III    ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS      The primary consideration in regard to the question of diet should be,  as already stated, the hygienic. Having shown that the non-flesh diet is  the more natural, and the more advantageous from the point of view of  health, let us now consider which of the two--vegetarianism or  omnivorism--is superior from the ethical point of view.    The science of ethics is the science of conduct. It is founded,  primarily, upon philosophical postulates without which no code or system  of morals could be formulated. Briefly, these postulates are, (a), every  activity of man has as its deepest motive the end termed Happiness, (b)  the Happiness of the individual is indissolubly bound up with the  Happiness of all Creation. The truth of (a) will be evident to every  person of normal intelligence: all arts and systems aim consciously, or  unconsciously, at some good, and so far as names are concerned everyone  will be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22832"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Canterbury [2nd ed.] (#4)"],[1,"thither from Sandwich to  return thanks to God and St. Thomas. After him all the English kings and  all the Continental potentates who visited the shores of Britain, paid due  homage, and doubtless made due offering, at the shrine of the sainted  archbishop. The crown of Scotland was presented in A.D. 1299 by Edward  Longshanks, and Henry V. gave thanks here after his victory over the  French at Agincourt. Emperors, both of the east and west, humbled  themselves before the relics of the famous English martyr. Henry VIII. and  the Emperor Charles V. came together at Whitsuntide, A.D. 1520, in more  than royal splendour, and with a great retinue of English and Spanish  noblemen, and worshipped at the shrine which had then reached the zenith  of its glory.    But though the stately stories of these royal progresses to the tomb of  the martyred archbishop strike the imagination vividly, yet the picture  presented by Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" is in reality much more  impressive. For we find there all ranks of society alike making the  pilgrimage--the knight, the yeoman, the prioress, the monk, the friar, the  merchant, the scholar from Oxford, the lawyer, the squire, the tradesman,  the cook, the shipman, the physician, the clothier from Bath, the priest,  the miller, the reeve, the manciple, the seller of indulgences, and,  lastly, the poet himself--all these various sorts and conditions of men  and women we find journeying down to Canterbury in a sort of motley  caravan. Foreign pilgrims also came to the sacred shrine in great numbers.  A curious record, preserved in a Latin translation, of the journey of a  Bohemian noble, Leo von Rotzmital, who visited England in 1446, gives a  quaint description of Canterbury and its approaches. \"Sailing up the  Channel,\" the narrator writes, \"as we drew near to England we saw lofty  mountains full of chalk. These mountains seem from a distance to be clad  with snows. On them lies a citadel, built by devils, '_a Cacodaemonibus  extructa_,' so stoutly fortified that its peer could not be found in any  province of Christendom. Passing by these mountains and citadel we put in  at the city of Sandwich (_Sandvicum_).... But at nothing did I marvel more  greatly than at the sailors climbing up the masts and foretelling the  distance, and approach of the winds, and which sails should be set and  which furled. Among them I saw one sailor so nimble that scarce could any  man be compared with him.\" Journeying on to Canterbury, our pilgrim  proceeds: \"There we saw the tomb and head of the martyr. The tomb is of  pure gold, and embellished with jewels, and so enriched with splendid  offerings that I know not its peer. Among other precious things upon it is  beholden the carbuncle jewel, which is wont to shine by night, half a  hen's egg in size. For that tomb has been lavishly enriched by many kings,  princes, wealthy traders, and other righteous men.\"    Such was Canterbury Cathedral in the middle ages, the resort of emperors,  kings, and all classes of humble folk, English and foreign. It was in the  spring chiefly, as Chaucer tells us, that        \"Whanne that April with his showres sote      The droughte of March hath perced to the rote,      And bathed every veine in swiche licour,      Of whiche vertue engendred is the flour;      When Zephyrus eke with his sote brethe      Enspired hath in every holt and hethe      The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne      Hath in the Ram his halfe cours yronne,      And smale foules maken melodie      That slepen alle night with open eye,      So priketh hem nature in hir corages;      Than longen folk to gon on pilgrimages      And palmeres for to seken strange strondes      To serve hauves couthe in sondry londes;      And specially from every shires ende      Of Englelonde, to Canterbury they wende      The holy blissful martyr for to seke,      That hem hath holpen when that they were seke.\"    The miracles performed by the bones of the blessed martyr are stated by  contemporary writers to have been extraordinarily numerous. We have it on  the authority of Gervase that two volumes full of these marvels were  preserved at Canterbury, and in those days a volume meant a tome of  formidable dimensions; but scarcely any record of these most interesting  occurrences has been preserved. At the time of Henry VIII.'s quarrel with  the dead archbishop--of which more anon--the name of St. Thomas and all  account of his deeds was erased from every book that the strictest  investigation could lay hands on. So thoroughly was this spiteful edict  carried out that the records of the greatest of English saints are  astonishingly meagre. A letter, however, has been preserved, written about  A.D. 1390 by Richard II. to congratulate the then archbishop, William  Courtenay, on a fresh miracle performed by St. Thomas: \"_Litera domini  Regis graciosa missa domino archiepiscopo, regraciando sibi de novo  miraculo Sancti Thome Martiris sibi denunciato._\" The letter refers, in  its quaint Norman-French, to the good influence that will be exercised by  such a manifestation, as a practical argument against the \"various enemies  of our faith and belief\"--_noz foie et creaunce ount plousours enemys_.  These were the Lollards, and the pious king says that he hopes and  believes that they will be brought back to the right path by the effect  of this miracle, which seems to have been worked to heal a distinguished  foreigner--_en une persone estraunge_.    Another document (dated A.D. 1455) preserves the story of the miraculous  cure of a young Scotsman, from Aberdeen, _Allexander Stephani filius in  Scocia, de Aberdyn oppido natus_. Alexander was lame, _pedibus contractus_,  from his birth, we are told that after twenty-four years of pain and  discomfort--_vigintiquatuor annis penaliter laborabat_--he made a  pilgrimage to Canterbury, and there \"the sainted Thomas, the divine  clemency aiding him, on the second day of the month of May did straightway  restore his legs and feet, _bases et plantas_, to the same Alexander.\"    Other miracles performed by the saint are pictured in the painted windows  of Trinity Chapel, of which we shall treat fully later on. The fame of the  martyr spread through the whole of Christendom. Stanley tells us that  \"there is probably no country in Europe which does not exhibit traces of  Becket. A tooth of his is preserved in the church of San Thomaso  Cantuariense at Verona, part of an arm in a convent at Florence, and  another part in the church of St. Waldetrude at Mons; in Fuller's time  both arms were displayed in the English convent at Lisbon; while Bourbourg  preserves his chalice, Douay his hair shirt, and St. Omer his mitre. The  cathedral of Sens contains his vestments and an ancient altar at which he  said mass. His story is pictured in the painted windows at Chartres, and  Sens, and St. Omer, and his figure is to be seen in the church of Monreale  at Palermo.\"    In England almost every county contained a church or convent dedicated to  St. Thomas. Most notable of these was the abbey of Aberbrothock, raised,  within seven years after the martyrdom, to the memory of the saint by  William the Lion, king of Scotland. William had been defeated by the  English forces on the very day on which Henry II. had done penance at the  tomb, and made his peace with the saint, and attributing his misfortunes  to the miraculous influence of St. Thomas, endeavoured to propitiate him  by the dedication of this magnificent abbey. A mutilated image of the  saint has been preserved among the ruins of the monastery. This is perhaps  the most notable of the gifts to St. Thomas. The volume of the offerings  which were poured into the Canterbury coffers by grateful invalids who  had been cured of their ailments, and by others who, like the Scotch king,  were anxious to propitiate the power of the saint, must have been  enormous. We know that at the beginning of the sixteenth century the  yearly offerings, though their sums had already greatly diminished, were  worth about L4,000, according to the present value of money.    The story of the fall of the shrine and the overthrow of the power of the  martyr is so remarkable and was so implicitly believed at the time, that  it cannot be passed over in spite of the doubts which modern criticism  casts on its authenticity. It is said that in April, A.D. 1538, a writ of  summons was issued in the name of King Henry VIII. against Thomas Becket,  sometime Archbishop of Canterbury, accusing him of treason, contumacy, and  rebellion. This document was read before the martyr's tomb, and thirty  days were allowed for his answer to the summons. As the defendant did not  appear, the suit was formally tried at Westminster. The Attorney General  held a brief for Henry II., and the deceased defendant was represented by  an advocate named by Henry VIII. Needless to relate, judgment was given in  favour of Henry II., and the condemned Archbishop was ordered to have his  bones burnt and all his gorgeous offerings escheated to the Crown. The  first part of the sentence was remitted and Becket's body was buried, but  he was deprived of the title of Saint, his images were destroyed  throughout the kingdom, and his name was erased from all books. The shrine  was destroyed, and the gold and jewels thereof were taken away in  twenty-six carts. Henry VIII. himself wore the Regale of France in a ring  on his thumb. Improbable as the story of Becket's trial may seem, such a  procedure was strictly in accordance with the forms of the Roman Catholic  Church, of which Henry still at that time professed himself a member:  moreover it is not without authentic parallels in history: exactly the  same measures of reprisal had been taken against Wycliffe at Lutterworth;  and Queen Mary shortly afterwards acted in a similar manner towards Bucer  and Fagius at Cambridge.    The last recorded pilgrim to the shrine of St. Thomas was Madame de"]]]
