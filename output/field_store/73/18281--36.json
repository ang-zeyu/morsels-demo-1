[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#4)"],[1," came before me,  saying--Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem  all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it;  wherefore give me thine honor. But, behold, my Beloved son, which was my  Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be  done, and the glory be thine forever. Wherefore, because that Satan  rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I,  the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine  own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should  be cast down; and he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of  all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his  will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.\"[10]    Thus it is shown that prior to the placing of man upon the earth, how  long before we do not know, Christ and Satan, together with the hosts of  the spirit-children of God, existed as intelligent individuals,[11]  possessing power and opportunity to choose the course they would pursue  and the leaders whom they would follow and obey.[12] In that great  concourse of spirit-intelligences, the Father's plan, whereby His  children would be advanced to their second estate, was submitted and  doubtless discussed. The opportunity so placed within the reach of the  spirits who were to be privileged to take bodies upon the earth was so  transcendently glorious that those heavenly multitudes burst forth into  song and shouted for joy.[13]    Satan's plan of compulsion, whereby all would be safely conducted  through the career of mortality, bereft of freedom to act and agency to  choose, so circumscribed that they would be compelled to do right--that  one soul would not be lost--was rejected; and the humble offer of Jesus  the First-born--to assume mortality and live among men as their Exemplar  and Teacher, observing the sanctity of man's agency but teaching men to  use aright that divine heritage--was accepted. The decision brought war,  which resulted in the vanquishment of Satan and his angels, who were  cast out and deprived of the boundless privileges incident to the mortal  or second estate.    In that august council of the angels and the Gods, the Being who later  was born in flesh as Mary's Son, Jesus, took prominent part, and there  was He ordained of the Father to be the Savior of mankind. As to time,  the term being used in the sense of all duration past, this is our  earliest record of the Firstborn among the sons of God; to us who read,  it marks the beginning of the written history of Jesus the Christ.[14]    Old Testament scriptures, while abounding in promises relating to the  actuality of Christ's advent in the flesh, are less specific in  information concerning His antemortal existence. By the children of  Israel, while living under the law and still unprepared to receive the  gospel, the Messiah was looked for as one to be born in the lineage of  Abraham and David, empowered to deliver them from personal and national  burdens, and to vanquish their enemies. The actuality of the Messiah's  status as the chosen Son of God, who was with the Father from the  beginning, a Being of preexistent power and glory, was but dimly  perceived, if conceived at all, by the people in general; and although  to prophets specially commissioned in the authorities and privileges of  the Holy Priesthood, revelation of the great truth was given,[15] they  transmitted it to the people rather in the language of imagery and  parable than in words of direct plainness. Nevertheless the testimony of  the evangelists and the apostles, the attestation of the Christ Himself  while in the flesh, and the revelations given in the present  dispensation leave us without dearth of scriptural proof.    In the opening lines of the Gospel book written by John the apostle, we  read: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the word was with God, and the  word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were  made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.... And  the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory,  the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and  truth.\"[16]    The passage is simple, precise and unambiguous. We may reasonably give  to the phrase \"In the beginning\" the same meaning as attaches thereto in  the first line of Genesis; and such signification must indicate a time  antecedent to the earliest stages of human existence upon the earth.  That the Word is Jesus Christ, who was with the Father in that beginning  and who was Himself invested with the powers and rank of Godship, and  that He came into the world and dwelt among men, are definitely  affirmed. These statements are corroborated through a revelation given  to Moses, in which he was permitted to see many of the creations of God,  and to hear the voice of the Father with respect to the things that had  been made: \"And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is  mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth.\"[17]    John the apostle repeatedly affirms the preexistence of the Christ and  the fact of His authority and power in the antemortal state.[18] To the  same effect is the testimony of Paul[19] and of Peter. Instructing the  saints concerning the basis of their faith, the last-named apostle  impressed upon them that their redemption was not to be secured through  corruptible things nor by the outward observance of traditional  requirements, \"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb  without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the  foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for  you.\"[20]    Even more impressive and yet more truly conclusive are the personal  testimonies of the Savior as to His own pre-existent life and the  mission among men to which He had been appointed. No one who accepts  Jesus as the Messiah can consistently reject these evidences of His  eternal nature. When, on a certain occasion, the Jews in the synagogue  disputed among themselves and murmured because of their failure to  understand aright His doctrine concerning Himself, especially as  touching His relationship with the Father, Jesus said unto them: \"For I  came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that  sent me.\" And then, continuing the lesson based upon the contrast  between the manna with which their fathers had been fed in the  wilderness and the bread of life which He had to offer, He added: \"I am  the living bread which came down from heaven,\" and again declared \"the  living Father hath sent me.\" Not a few of the disciples failed to  comprehend His teachings; and their complaints drew from Him these  words: \"Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man  ascend up where he was before?\"[21]    To certain wicked Jews, wrapped in the mantle of racial pride, boastful  of their descent through the lineage of Abraham, and seeking to excuse  their sins through an unwarranted use of the great patriarch's name, our  Lord thus proclaimed His own preeminence: \"Verily, verily, I say unto  you, Before Abraham was, I am.\"[22] The fuller significance of this  remark will be treated later; suffice it in the present connection to  consider this scripture as a plain avowal of our Lord's seniority and  supremacy over Abraham. But as Abraham's birth had preceded that of  Christ by more than nineteen centuries, such seniority must have  reference to a state of existence antedating that of mortality.    When the hour of His betrayal was near, in the last interview with the  apostles prior to His agonizing experience in Gethsemane, Jesus  comforted them saying: \"For the Father himself loveth you, because ye  have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. I came forth  from the Father, and am come into the world again, I leave the world,  and go to the Father.\"[23] Furthermore, in the course of upwelling  prayer for those who had been true to their testimony of His  Messiahship, He addressed the Father with this solemn invocation: \"And  this is the life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,  and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee on the  earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O  Father glorify thou with thine own self with the glory which I had with  thee before the world was.\"[24]    Book of Mormon scriptures are likewise explicit in proof of the  preexistence of the Christ and of His foreappointed mission. One only of  the many evidences therein found will be cited here. An ancient prophet,  designated in the record as the brother of Jared,[25] once pleaded with  the Lord in special supplication: \"And the Lord said unto him, Believest  thou the words which I shall speak? And he answered, Yea, Lord, I know  that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not  lie. And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord shewed himself  unto him, and said, Because thou knowest these things, ye are redeemed  from the fall: therefore ye are brought back into my presence; therefore  I shew myself unto you. Behold, I am he who was prepared from the  foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ.  I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have light, and  that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall  become my sons and my daughters. And never have I shewed myself unto man  whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast.  Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men  were created in the beginning, after mine own image. Behold, this body,  which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created  after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the  spirit, will I appear unto my people in the flesh.\"[26]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22544"],[0,"A World is Born (#4)"],[1,"echoing  clamor of footsteps, and the glare of torches on the wall of a  cross-passage ahead.    Voices came to Gray, distorted by the rock vaults.    \"I'm sure I heard them, just then.\" It was Jill's voice.    \"Yeah.\" That was Dio. \"The trouble is, where?\"    The footsteps halted. Then, \"Let's try this passage. We don't want to  get too far into this maze.\"    Caron's leader blasphemed softly and dodged into a side tunnel. The man  next to Gray stumbled and cried out with pain as he struck the wall, and  a shout rose behind them.    The leader broke into a run, twisting, turning, diving into the maze of  smaller tunnels. The sounds of pursuit faded, were lost in the tomblike  silence of the caves. One of the men laughed.    \"We sure lost 'em!\"    \"Yeah,\" said the leader. \"We lost 'em, all right.\" Gray caught the note  of panic in his voice. \"We lost the markers, too.\"    \"You mean...?\"    \"Yeah. Turning off like that did it. Unless we can find that marked  tunnel, we're sunk!\"    Gray, silent in the shadows, laughed a bitter, ironic laugh.           *       *       *       *       *    They went on, stumbling down endless black halls, losing all track of  branching corridors, straining to catch the first glint of saving light.  Once or twice they caught the echoes of Dio's party, and knew that they,  too, were lost and wandering.    Then, quite suddenly, they came out into a vast gallery, running like a  subway tube straight to left and right. A wind tore down it, hot as a  draught from the burning gates of Hell.    It was a moment before anyone grasped the significance of that wind.  Then someone shouted,    \"We're saved! All we have to do is walk against it!\"    They turned left, almost running in the teeth of that searing blast. And  Gray began to notice a peculiar thing.    The air was charged with electricity. His clothing stiffened and  crackled. His hair crawled on his head. He could see the faint  discharges of sparks from his companions.    Whether it was the effect of the charged air, or the reaction from the  nervous strain of the past hours, Mel Gray began to be afraid.    Weary to exhaustion, they struggled on against the burning wind. And  then they blundered out into a cave, huge as a cathedral, lighted by a  queer, uncertain bluish light.    Gray caught the sharp smell of ozone. His whole body was tingling with  electric tension. The bluish light seemed to be in indeterminate lumps  scattered over the rocky floor. The rush of the wind under that  tremendous vault was terrifying.    They stopped, Gray keeping to the background. Now was the time to evade  his unconscious helpers. The moment they reached daylight, he'd be  discovered.    Soft-footed as a cat, he was already hidden among the heavy shadows of  the fluted walls when, he heard the voices.    They came from off to the right, a confused shout of men under fearful  strain, growing louder and louder, underscored with the tramp of  footsteps. Lights blazed suddenly in the cathedral dark, and from the  mouth of a great tunnel some hundred yards away, the men of the Project  poured into the cave.    And then, sharp and high and unexpected, a man screamed.           *       *       *       *       *    The lumps of blue light were moving. And a man had died. He lay on the  rock, his flesh blackened jelly, with a rope of glowing light running  from the metal of his gun butt to the metal buttons on his cap.    All across the vast floor of that cavern the slow, eerie ripple of  motion grew. The scattered lumps melted and flowed together, converging  in wavelets of blue flame upon the men.    The answer came to Gray. Those things were some form of energy-life,  born of the tremendous electric tensions on Mercury. Like all  electricity, they were attracted to metal.    In a sudden frenzy of motion, he ripped off his metal-framed goggles,  his cap and gun-belt. The Moultons forbade metal because of the danger  of lightning, and his boots were made of rubber, so he felt reasonably  safe, but a tense fear ran in prickling waves across his skin.    Guns began to bark, their feeble thunder all but drowned in the vast  rush of the wind. Bullets struck the oncoming waves of light with no  more effect than the eruption of a shower of sparks. Gray's attention,  somehow, was riveted on Jill, standing with Dio at the head of her men.    She wore ordinary light slippers, having been dressed only for indoors.  And there were silver ornaments at waist and throat.    He might have escaped, then, quite unnoticed. Instead, for a reason even  he couldn't understand, he ran for Jill Moulton.    The first ripples of blue fire touched the ranks of Dio's men. Bolts of  it leaped upward to fasten upon gun-butts and the buckles of the  cartridge belts. Men screamed, fell, and died.    An arm of the fire licked out, driving in behind Dio and the girl. The  guns of Caron's four remaining men were silent, now.    Gray leaped over that hissing electric surf, running toward Jill. A  hungry worm of light reared up, searching for Dio's gun. Gray's hand  swept it down, to be instantly buried in a mass of glowing ropes. Dio's  hatchet face snarled at him in startled anger.    Jill cried out as Gray tore the silver ornaments from her dress. \"Throw  down the guns!\" he yelled. \"It's metal they want!\"    He heard his name shouted by men torn momentarily from their own terror.  Dio cried, \"Shoot him!\" A few bullets whined past, but their immediate  fear spoiled both aim and attention.    Gray caught up Jill and began to run, toward the tube from which the  wind howled in the cave. Behind him, grimly, Dio followed.    The electric beasts didn't notice him. His insulated feet trampled  through them, buried to the ankle in living flame, feeling queer tenuous  bodies break and reform.    The wind met them like a physical barrier at the tunnel mouth. Gray put  Jill down. The wind strangled him. He tore off his coat and wrapped it  over the girl's head, using his shirt over his own. Jill, her black  curls whipped straight, tried to fight back past him, and he saw Dio  coming, bent double against the wind.    He saw something else. Something that made him grab Jill and point, his  flesh crawling with swift, cold dread.           *       *       *       *       *    The electric beasts had finished their pleasure. The dead were cinders  on the rock. The living had run back into the tunnels. And now the blue  sea of fire was flowing again, straight toward the place where they  stood.    It was flowing fast, and Gray sensed an urgency, an impersonal haste, as  though a command had been laid upon those living ropes of flame.    The first dim rumble of thunder rolled down the wind. Gripping Jill,  Gray turned up the tunnel.    The wind, compressed in that narrow throat of rock, beat them blind and  breathless, beat them to their bellies, to crawl. How long it took them,  they never knew.    But Gray caught glimpses of Dio the Martian crawling behind them, and  behind him again, the relentless flow of the fire-things.    They floundered out onto a rocky slope, fell away beneath the suck of  the wind, and lay still, gasping. It was hot. Thunder crashed abruptly,  and lightning flared between the cliffs.    Gray felt a contracting of the heart. There were no cables.    Then he saw it--the small, fast fighter flying below them on a flat  plateau. A cave mouth beside it had been closed with a plastic door. The  ship was the one that had followed them. He guessed at another one  behind the protecting door.    Raking the tumbled blond hair out of his eyes, Gray got up.    Jill was still sitting, her black curls bowed between her hands. There  wasn't much time, but Gray yielded to impulse. Pulling her head back by  the silken hair, he kissed her.    \"If you ever get tired of virtue, sweetheart, look me up.\" But somehow  he wasn't grinning, and he ran down the slope.    He was almost to the open lock of the ship when things began to happen.  Dio staggered out of the wind-tunnel and sagged down beside Jill. Then,  abruptly, the big door opened.    Five men came out--one in pilot's costume, two in nondescript apparel,  one in expensive business clothes, and the fifth in dark prison garb.    Gray recognized the last two. Caron of Mars and the errant Ward.    They were evidently on the verge of leaving. But they looked cheerful.  Caron's sickly-sweet face all but oozed honey, and Ward was grinning his  rat's grin.    Thunder banged and rolled among the rocks. Lightning flared in the  cloudy murk. Gray saw the hull of a second ship beyond the door. Then  the newcomers had seen him, and the two on the slope.    Guns ripped out of holsters. Gray's heart began to pound slowly. He, and  Jill and Dio, were caught on that naked slope, with the flood of  electric death at their backs.    His Indianesque face hardened. Bullets whined round him as he turned  back up the slope, but he ran doubled over, putting all his hope in the  tricky, uncertain light.    Jill and the Martian crouched stiffly, not knowing where to turn. A  flare of lightning showed Gray the first of the firethings, flowing out  onto the ledge, hidden from the men below.    \"Back into the cave!\" he yelled. His urgent hand fairly lifted Dio. The  Martian glared at him, then obeyed. Bullets snarled against the rock.  The light was too bad for accurate shooting, but luck couldn't stay with  them forever.    Gray glanced over his shoulder as they scrambled up on the ledge. Caron  waited by his ship. Ward and the others were charging the slope. Gray's  teeth gleamed in a cruel grin.    Sweeping Jill into his arms, he stepped into the lapping flow of fire.  Dio swore viciously, but he followed. They started toward the cave  mouth, staggering in the rush of the wind.    \"For God's sake, don't fall,\" snapped Gray. \"Here they come!\"    The pilot and one of the nondescript men were the first over. They were  into the river of fire before they knew, it,"]]]
