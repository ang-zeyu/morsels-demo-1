[Illustr"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24923"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Vol. I. (#4)"],[1," of Hybridity; and, lastly, the absence, at the present  time and in our geological formations, of innumerable links connecting all  allied species. Although some of these difficulties are of great weight, we  shall see that many of them are explicable on the theory of natural  selection, and are otherwise inexplicable.    In scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis, and  if it explains various large and independent classes of facts it rises to  the rank of a well-grounded theory. The {9} undulations of the ether and  even its existence are hypothetical, yet every one now admits the  undulatory theory of light. The principle of natural selection may be  looked at as a mere hypothesis, but rendered in some degree probable by  what we positively know of the variability of organic beings in a state of  nature,--by what we positively know of the struggle for existence, and the  consequent almost inevitable preservation of favourable variations,--and  from the analogical formation of domestic races. Now this hypothesis may be  tested,--and this seems to me the only fair and legitimate manner of  considering the whole question,--by trying whether it explains several  large and independent classes of facts; such as the geological succession  of organic beings, their distribution in past and present times, and their  mutual affinities and homologies. If the principle of natural selection  does explain these and other large bodies of facts, it ought to be  received. On the ordinary view of each species having been independently  created, we gain no scientific explanation of any one of these facts. We  can only say that it has so pleased the Creator to command that the past  and present inhabitants of the world should appear in a certain order and  in certain areas; that He has impressed on them the most extraordinary  resemblances, and has classed them in groups subordinate to groups. But by  such statements we gain no new knowledge; we do not connect together facts  and laws; we explain nothing.    In a third work I shall try the principle of natural selection by seeing  how far it will give a fair explanation of the several classes of facts  just alluded to. It was the consideration of these facts which first led me  to take up the present subject. When I visited, during the voyage of H.M.S.  _Beagle_, the Galapagos Archipelago, situated in the Pacific Ocean about  500 miles from the shore of South America, I found myself surrounded by  peculiar species of birds, reptiles, and plants, existing nowhere else in  the world. Yet they nearly all bore an American stamp. In the song of the  mocking-thrush, in the harsh cry of the carrion-hawk, in the great  candlestick-like opuntias, I clearly perceived the neighbourhood of  America, though the islands were separated by so many miles of ocean from  the mainland, and differed much from it in their geological {10}  constitution and climate. Still more surprising was the fact that most of  the inhabitants of each separate island in this small archipelago were  specifically different, though most closely related to each other. The  archipelago, with its innumerable craters and bare streams of lava,  appeared to be of recent origin; and thus I fancied myself brought near to  the very act of creation. I often asked myself how these many peculiar  animals and plants had been produced: the simplest answer seemed to be that  the inhabitants of the several islands had descended from each other,  undergoing modification in the course of their descent; and that all the  inhabitants of the archipelago had descended from those of the nearest  land, namely America, whence colonists would naturally have been derived.  But it long remained to me an inexplicable problem how the necessary degree  of modification could have been effected, and it would have thus remained  for ever, had I not studied domestic productions, and thus acquired a just  idea of the power of Selection. As soon as I had fully realized this idea,  I saw, on reading Malthus on Population, that Natural Selection was the  inevitable result of the rapid increase of all organic beings; for I was  prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence by having long studied  the habits of animals.    Before visiting the Galapagos I had collected many animals whilst  travelling from north to south on both sides of America, and everywhere,  under conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive,  American forms were met with--species replacing species of the same  peculiar genera. Thus it was when the Cordilleras were ascended, or the  thick tropical forests penetrated, or the fresh waters of America searched.  Subsequently I visited other countries, which in all the conditions of life  were incomparably more like to parts of South America, than the different  parts of that continent were to each other; yet in these countries, as in  Australia or Southern Africa, the traveller cannot fail to be struck with  the entire difference of their productions. Again the reflection was forced  on me that community of descent from the early inhabitants or colonists of  South America would alone explain the wide prevalence of American types of  structure throughout that immense area.    To exhume with one's own hands the bones of extinct and {11} gigantic  quadrupeds brings the whole question of the succession of species vividly  before one's mind; and I had found in South America great pieces of  tesselated armour exactly like, but on a magnificent scale, that covering  the pigmy armadillo; I had found great teeth like those of the living  sloth, and bones like those of the cavy. An analogous succession of allied  forms had been previously observed in Australia. Here then we see the  prevalence, as if by descent, in time as in space, of the same types in the  same areas; and in neither case does the similarity of the conditions by  any means seem sufficient to account for the similarity of the forms of  life. It is notorious that the fossil remains of closely consecutive  formations are closely allied in structure, and we can at once understand  the fact if they are likewise closely allied by descent. The succession of  the many distinct species of the same genus throughout the long series of  geological formations seems to have been unbroken or continuous. New  species come in gradually one by one. Ancient and extinct forms of life  often show combined or intermediate characters, like the words of a dead  language with respect to its several offshoots or living tongues. All these  and other such facts seemed to me to point to descent with modification as  the method of production of new groups of species.    The innumerable past and present inhabitants of the world are connected  together by the most singular and complex affinities, and can be classed in  groups under groups, in the same manner as varieties can be classed under  species and sub-varieties under varieties, but with much higher grades of  difference. It will be seen in my third work that these complex affinities  and the rules for classification receive a rational explanation on the  principle of descent, together with modifications acquired through natural  selection, entailing divergence of character and the extinction of  intermediate forms. How inexplicable is the similar pattern of the hand of  a man, the foot of a dog, the wing of a bat, the flipper of a seal, on the  doctrine of independent acts of creation! how simply explained on the  principle of the natural selection of successive slight variations in the  diverging descendants from {12} a single progenitor! So it is, if we look  to the structure of an individual animal or plant, when we see the fore and  hind limbs, the skull and vertebrae, the jaws and legs of a crab, the  petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, built on the same type or  pattern. During the many changes to which in the course of time all organic  beings have been subjected, certain organs or parts have occasionally  become at first of little use and ultimately superfluous; and the retention  of such parts in a rudimentary and utterly useless condition can, on the  descent-theory, be simply understood. On the principle of modifications  being inherited at the same age in the child, at which each successive  variation first appeared in the parent, we shall see why rudimentary parts  and organs are generally well developed in the individual at a very early  age. On the same principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, and on the  principle of variations not generally supervening at a very early period of  embryonic growth (and both these principles can be shown to be probable  from direct evidence), that most wonderful fact in the whole round of  natural history, namely, the similarity of members of the same great class  in their embryonic condition,--the embryo, for instance, of a mammal, bird,  reptile, and fish being barely distinguishable,--becomes simply  intelligible.    It is the consideration and explanation of such facts as these which has  convinced me that the theory of descent with modification by means of  natural selection is in the main true. These facts have as yet received no  explanation on the theory of independent Creations; they cannot be grouped  together under one point of view, but each has to be considered as an  ultimate fact. As the first origin of life on this earth, as well as the  continued life of each individual, is at present quite beyond the scope of  science, I do not wish to lay much stress on the greater simplicity of the  view of a few forms, or of only one form, having been originally created,  instead of innumerable miraculous creations having been necessary at  innumerable periods; though this more simple view accords well with  Maupertuis's philosophical axiom \"of least action.\"    In considering how far the theory of natural selection may be {13}  extended,--that is,"]]]
