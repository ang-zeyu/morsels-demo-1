In a letter to Kepler, dated in  1597, he distinctly states that he _had, many years ago, adopted the  opinions of Copernicus_; but that _he had not yet dared to publish his  arguments in favour of them, and his refutation of the opposite  opinions_. These facts would leave us to place Galileo's conversion  somewhere between 1593 and 1597, although _many_ years cannot be said  to have elapsed between these two dates.         [7] The authenticity of this work has been doubted. It was printed       at Rome, in 1656, from a MS. in the library of Somaschi, at Venice.       See Opere di Galileo, tom. vii. p. 427.    At this early period of Galileo's life, in the year 1593, he met with an  accident which had nearly proved fatal. A party at Padua, of which he  was one, were enjoying, at an open window, a current of air, which was  artificially cooled by a fall of water. Galileo unfortunately fell  asleep under its influence; and so powerful was its effect upon his  robust constitution, that he contracted a severe chronic disorder,  accompanied with acute pains in his body, and loss of sleep and  appetite, which attacked him at intervals during the rest of his life.  Others of the party suffered still more severely, and perished by their  own rashness.    Galileo's reputation was now widely extended over Europe. The Archduke  Ferdinand (afterwards Emperor of Germany), the Landgrave of Hesse, and  the Princes of Alsace and Mantua, honoured his lectures with their  presence; and Prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden also received  instructions from him in mathematics, during his sojourn in Italy.    When Galileo had completed the first period of his engagement at Padua,  he was re-elected for other six years, with an increased salary of 320  florins. This liberal addition to his income is ascribed by Fabbroni to  the malice of one of his enemies, who informed the Senate that Galileo  was living in illicit intercourse with Marina Gamba. Without inquiring  into the truth of the accusation, the Senate is said to have replied,  that if \"he had a family to support, he had the more need of an  increased salary.\" It is more likely that the liberality of the republic  had been called forth by the high reputation of their professor, and  that the terms of their reply were intended only to rebuke the malignity  of the informer. The mode of expression would seem to indicate that one  or more of Galileo's children had been born previous to his re-election  in 1598; but as this is scarcely consistent with other facts, we are  disposed to doubt the authenticity of Fabbroni's anecdote.    The new star which attracted the notice of astronomers in 1604, excited  the particular attention of Galileo. The observations which he made upon  it, and the speculations which they suggested, formed the subject of  three lectures, the beginning of the first of which only has reached  our times. From the absence of parallax, he proved that the common  hypothesis of its being a meteor was erroneous, and that, like the fixed  stars, it was situated far beyond the bounds of our own system. The  popularity of the subject attracted crowds to his lecture-room; and  Galileo had the boldness to reproach his hearers for taking so deep an  interest in a temporary phenomenon, while they overlooked the wonders of  creation which were daily presented to their view.    In the year 1606, Galileo was again appointed to the professorship at  Padua, with an augmented stipend of 520 florins. His popularity had now  risen so high, that his audience could not be accommodated in his  lecture-room; and even when he had assembled them in the school of  medicine, which contained 1000 persons, he was frequently obliged to  adjourn to the open air.    Among the variety of pursuits which occupied his attention, was the  examination of the properties of the loadstone. In 1607, he commenced  his experiments; but, with the exception of a method of arming  loadstones, which, according to the report of Sir Kenelm Digby, enabled  them to carry twice as much weight as before, he does not seem to have  made any additions to our knowledge of magnetism. He appears to have  studied with care the admirable work of our countryman, Dr Gilbert, \"De  Magnete,\" which was published in 1600; and he recognised in the  experiments and reasonings of the English philosopher the principles of  that method of investigating truth which he had himself adopted. Gilbert  died in 1603, in the 63d year of his age, and probably never read the  fine compliment which was paid to him by the Italian philosopher--\"I  extremely praise, admire, and envy this author.\"          CHAPTER II.         _Cosmo, Grand Duke of Tuscany, invites Galileo to Pisa--Galileo       visits Venice in 1609, where he first hears of the Telescope--He       invents and constructs one, which excites a great       sensation--Discovers Mountains in the Moon, and Forty Stars in the       Pleiades--Discovers Jupiter's Satellites in 1610--Effect of this       discovery on Kepler--Manner in which these discoveries were       received--Galileo appointed Mathematician to Cosmo--Mayer claims       the discovery of the Satellites of Jupiter--Harriot observes them       in England in October 1610._      In the preceding chapter we have brought down the history of Galileo's  labours to that auspicious year in which he first directed the telescope  to the heavens. No sooner was that noble instrument placed in his hands,  than Providence released him from his professional toils, and supplied  him with the fullest leisure and the amplest means for pursuing and  completing the grandest discoveries.    Although he had quitted the service and the domains of his munificent  patron, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, yet he maintained his connection with  the family, by visiting Florence during his academic vacations, and  giving mathematical instruction to the younger branches of that  distinguished house. Cosmo, who had been one of his pupils, now  succeeded his father Ferdinand; and having his mind early imbued with a  love of knowledge, which had become hereditary in his family, he felt  that the residence of Galileo within his dominions, and still more his  introduction into his household, would do honour to their common  country, and reflect a lustre upon his own name. In the year 1609,  accordingly, Cosmo made proposals to Galileo to return to his original  situation at Pisa. These overtures were gratefully received; and in the  arrangements which Galileo on this occasion suggested, as well as in the  manner in which they were urged, we obtain some insight into his temper  and character. He informs the correspondent through whom Cosmo's offer  was conveyed, that his salary of 520 florins at Padua would be increased  to as many crowns at his re-election, and that he could enlarge his  income to any extent he pleased, by giving private lectures and  receiving pupils. His public duties, he stated, occupied him only sixty  half-hours in the year; but his studies suffered such interruptions from  his domestic pupils and private lectures, that his most ardent wish was  to be relieved from them, in order that he might have sufficient rest  and leisure, before the close of his life, to finish and publish those  great works which he had projected. In the event, therefore, of his  returning to Pisa, he hoped that it would be the first object of his  serene highness to give him leisure to complete his works without the  drudgery of lecturing. He expresses his anxiety to gain his bread by his  writings, and he promises to dedicate them to his serene master. He  enumerates, among these books, two on the system of the universe, three  on local motion, three books of mechanics, two on the demonstration of  principles, and one of problems; besides treatises on sound and speech,  on light and colours, on the tides, on the composition of continuous  quantity, on the motions of animals, and on the military art. On the  subject of his salary, he makes the following curious observations:--    \"I say nothing,\" says he, \"on the amount of my salary; being convinced  that, as I am to live upon it, the graciousness of his highness would  not deprive me of any of those comforts, of which, however, I feel the  want of less than many others; and, therefore, I say nothing more on the  subject. Finally, on the title and profession of my service, I should  wish that, to the title of mathematician, his highness would add that of  philosopher, as I profess to have studied a greater number of years in  philosophy, than months in pure mathematics; and how I have profited by  it, and if I can or ought to deserve this title, I may let their  highnesses see, as often as it shall please them to give me an  opportunity of discussing such subjects in their presence with those who  are most esteemed in this knowledge.\"    During the progress of this negotiation, Galileo went to Venice, on a  visit to a friend, in the month of April or May 1609. Here he learned,  from common rumour, that a Dutchman had presented to prince Maurice of  Nassau an optical instrument, which possessed the singular property of  causing distant objects to appear nearer the observer. This Dutchman was  Hans or John Lippershey, who, as has been clearly proved by the late  Professor Moll of Utrecht,[8] was in the possession of a telescope made  by himself so early as 2d October 1608. A few days afterwards, the truth  of this report was confirmed by a letter which Galileo received from  James Badorere at Paris, and he immediately applied himself to the  consideration of the subject. On the first night after his return to  Padua, he found, in the doctrines of refraction, the principle which he  sought. He placed at the ends of a leaden tube two spectacle glasses,  both of which were plain on one side, while one of them had its other  side convex, and the other its second"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26005"],[0,"Armour's Monthly Cook Book, Volume 2, No. 12, October 1913 (#4)"],[1,"from Armour's Chicken Bouillon Cubes),  one half teaspoon of salt, a pinch of celery salt, one cup of Armour's  Veribest Boned Chicken, two teaspoons of granulated gelatine, two  tablespoons of cold water, one cup of beaten cream, one tablespoon of  chopped olives, and whites of two eggs.

[Illustration: Prize Story]    Saving Steps in the Kitchen      The kitchen should be characterized by cleanliness, system and order.  Two maxims that will help save steps are: \"A place for everything, and  everything in its place;\" and \"Plan your work, then work your plan.\"    1. Arrange kitchen as conveniently and systematically as possible. Walls  and floors should be easily cleaned. No superfluous furnishings or  worn-out utensils should be tolerated. Arrange stove, sink, shelves,  table or kitchen cabinet near together and in logical order, so that in  preparing a dish one can move from raw material at table or cabinet  around to the washed dish at sink. Have shelves and hooks within easy  reach. Have drain-board and shelves for dishes convenient to sink. Keep  stove lifters and cloths for managing hot dishes upon hooks near stove.  Arrange those utensils and raw materials in constant use close at hand,  placing utensils used in same kind of work together. In storeroom and  pantry arrange shelves in certain order, with things seldom used on  highest shelves and those used oftener on lower shelves. Place together  ingredients used for salad-making, as vinegar, mustard, etc.; things  used in laundry together, etc. Other groups will suggest themselves.  Keep all groceries possible in air-tight labelled cans or glass jars.    2. Stock your kitchen with as many labor-saving devices as you can  afford, making sure they are suited to your needs. Keep all utensils and  tools in good repair. Glass oven-doors, small tables upon rollers which  can be wheeled into dining room, indexed cook books and clipping-files  are step-savers.    3. Plan each day's work ahead and have materials and utensils for that  day's work handy.    4. Do all kitchen work in a certain order, using that routine which  experience has proved best.    5. Think before you step. When in storeroom or pantry bring as many  needed articles as possible at one time. Baskets and waiters are great  helps here. In preparing a certain dish first gather together all  necessary ingredients and utensils. Do not begin work until everything  is ready. When possible prepare several things for the stove at once.    6. Clean and straighten as you go, replacing disarranged utensils, etc.  Have plenty of hot water handy, placing in soak those articles which  cannot be washed immediately. While preparing one meal do as much as  possible toward getting the next ready. If meals are planned ahead, many  things for supper can be cooked with the noon-day meal, also the  breakfast cereal. After each meal leave everything ship-shape for the  next.         MRS. L. H. MCRAVEN, MERIDIAN, MISS.        \"_Nobody knows the work it takes        To keep the home together;      Nobody knows the steps it takes,        Nobody knows but Mother._\"           *       *       *       *       *    _Keep a small market basket handy.
