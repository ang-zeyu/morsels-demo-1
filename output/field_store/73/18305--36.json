Both anger and fear make it do that. But there is only one  thing that can make the hair on the head of Farmer Brown's boy rise, and  as it isn't anger, of course it must be fear.    It never had happened before. You see, there isn't much of anything that  Farmer Brown's boy is really afraid of. Perhaps he wouldn't have been  afraid this time if it hadn't been for the surprise of what he found.  You see when he had found the heads of those trout on the bank he knew  right away that some one else had been fishing, and that was why he  couldn't catch any; but it didn't seem possible that little Billy Mink  could have eaten all those trout, and Farmer Brown's boy didn't once  think of Little Joe Otter, and so he was very, very much puzzled.    He was turning it all over in his mind and studying what it could mean,  when he came to a little muddy place on the bank of the Laughing Brook,  and there he saw something that made his eyes look as if they would pop  right out of his head, and it was right then that he felt his hair rise.  Anyway, that is what he said when he told about it afterward. What was  it he saw? What do you think? Why, it was a footprint in the soft mud.  Yes, Sir, that's what it was, and all it was. But it was the biggest  footprint Farmer Brown's boy ever had seen, and it looked as if it had  been made only a few minutes before. It was the footprint of Buster  Bear.    Now Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that Buster Bear had come down to the  Green Forest to live. He never had heard of a Bear being in the Green  Forest. And so he was so surprised that he had hard work to believe his  own eyes, and he had a queer feeling all over,--a little chilly feeling,  although it was a warm day. Somehow, he didn't feel like meeting Buster  Bear. If he had had his terrible gun with him, it might have been  different. But he didn't, and so he suddenly made up his mind that he  didn't want to fish any more that day. He had a funny feeling, too, that  he was being watched, although he couldn't see any one. He _was_ being  watched. Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear were watching him and taking  the greatest care to keep out of his sight.    All the way home through the Green Forest, Farmer Brown's boy kept  looking behind him, and he didn't draw a long breath until he reached  the edge of the Green Forest. He hadn't run, but he had wanted to.    \"Huh!\" said Buster Bear to Little Joe Otter, \"I believe he was afraid!\"    And Buster Bear was just exactly right.          IX    LITTLE JOE OTTER HAS GREAT NEWS TO TELL      Little Joe Otter was fairly bursting with excitement. He could hardly  contain himself. He felt that he had the greatest news to tell since  Peter Rabbit had first found the tracks of Buster Bear in the Green  Forest. He couldn't keep it to himself a minute longer than he had to.  So he hurried to the Smiling Pool, where he was sure he would find Billy  Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, and  he hoped that perhaps some of the little people who live in the Green  Forest might be there too. Sure enough, Peter Rabbit was there on one  side of the Smiling Pool, making faces at Reddy Fox, who was on the  other side, which, of course, was not at all nice of Peter. Mr. and Mrs.  Redwing were there, and Blacky the Crow was sitting in the Big  Hickory-tree.    Little Joe Otter swam straight to the Big Rock and climbed up to the  very highest part. He looked so excited, and his eyes sparkled so, that  every one knew right away that something had happened.    \"Hi!\" cried Billy Mink. \"Look at Little Joe Otter! It must be that for  once he has been smarter than Buster Bear.\"    Little Joe made a good-natured face at Billy Mink and shook his head.  \"No, Billy,\" said he, \"you are wrong, altogether wrong. I don't believe  anybody can be smarter than Buster Bear.\"    [Illustration: Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter.  _Page 45._]    Reddy Fox rolled his lips back in an unpleasant grin. \"Don't be too  sure of that!\" he snapped. \"I'm not through with him yet.\"    \"Boaster! Boaster!\" cried Peter Rabbit.    Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter. \"I'm not through with you  either, Peter Rabbit!\" he snarled. \"You'll find it out one of these fine  days!\"      \"Reddy, Reddy, smart and sly,    Couldn't catch a buzzing fly!\"    taunted Peter.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog in his deepest, gruffest voice. \"We  know all about that. What we want to know is what Little Joe Otter has  got on his mind.\"    \"It's news--great news!\" cried Little Joe.    \"We can tell better how great it is when we hear what it is,\" replied  Grandfather Frog testily. \"What is it?\"    Little Joe Otter looked around at all the eager faces watching him, and  then in the slowest, most provoking way, he drawled: \"Farmer Brown's boy  is afraid of Buster Bear.\"    For a minute no one said a word. Then Blacky the Crow leaned down from  his perch in the Big Hickory-tree and looked very hard at Little Joe as  he said:    \"I don't believe it. I don't believe a word of it. Farmer Brown's boy  isn't afraid of any one who lives in the Green Forest or on the Green  Meadows or in the Smiling Pool, and you know it. We are all afraid of  him.\"    Little Joe glared back at Blacky. \"I don't care whether you believe it  or not; it's true,\" he retorted. Then he told how early that very  morning he and Buster Bear had been fishing together in the Laughing  Brook, and how Farmer Brown's boy had been fishing there too, and hadn't  caught a single trout because they had all been caught or frightened  before he got there. Then he told how Farmer Brown's boy had found a  footprint of Buster Bear in the soft mud, and how he had stopped fishing  right away and started for home, looking behind him with fear in his  eyes all the way.    \"Now tell me that he isn't afraid!\" concluded Little Joe. \"For once he  knows just how we feel when he comes prowling around where we are. Isn't  that great news? Now we'll get even with _him_!\"    \"I'll believe it when I see it for myself!\" snapped Blacky the Crow.          X    BUSTER BEAR BECOMES A HERO      The news that Little Joe Otter told at the Smiling Pool,--how Farmer  Brown's boy had run away from Buster Bear without even seeing him,--soon  spread all over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, until  every one who lives there knew about it. Of course, Peter Rabbit helped  spread it. Trust Peter for that! But everybody else helped too. You see,  they had all been afraid of Farmer Brown's boy for so long that they  were tickled almost to pieces at the very thought of having some one in  the Green Forest who could make Farmer Brown's boy feel fear as they  had felt it. And so it was that Buster Bear became a hero right away to  most of them.    A few doubted Little Joe's story. One of them was Blacky the Crow.  Another was Reddy Fox. Blacky doubted because he knew Farmer Brown's boy  so well that he couldn't imagine him afraid. Reddy doubted because he  didn't want to believe. You see, he was jealous of Buster Bear, and at  the same time he was afraid of him. So Reddy pretended not to believe a  word of what Little Joe Otter had said, and he agreed with Blacky that  only by seeing Farmer Brown's boy afraid could he ever be made to  believe it. But nearly everybody else believed it, and there was great  rejoicing. Most of them were afraid of Buster, very much afraid of him,  because he was so big and strong. But they were still more afraid of  Farmer Brown's boy, because they didn't know him or understand him, and  because in the past he had tried to catch some of them in traps and had  hunted some of them with his terrible gun.    So now they were very proud to think that one of their own number  actually had frightened him, and they began to look on Buster Bear as a  real hero. They tried in ever so many ways to show him how friendly they  felt and went quite out of their way to do him favors. Whenever they met  one another, all they could talk about was the smartness and the  greatness of Buster Bear.    \"Now I guess Farmer Brown's boy will keep away from the Green Forest,  and we won't have to be all the time watching out for him,\" said Bobby  Coon, as he washed his dinner in the Laughing Brook, for you know he is  very neat and particular.    \"And he won't dare set any more traps for me,\" gloated Billy Mink.    \"Ah wish Brer Bear would go up to Farmer Brown's henhouse and scare  Farmer Brown's boy so that he would keep away from there. It would be a  favor to me which Ah cert'nly would appreciate,\" said Unc' Billy Possum  when he heard the news.    \"Let's all go together and tell Buster Bear how much obliged we are for  what he has done,\" proposed Jerry Muskrat.    \"That's a splendid idea!\" cried Little Joe Otter. \"We'll do it right  away.\"    \"Caw, caw caw!\" broke in Blacky the Crow. \"I say, let's wait and see for  ourselves if it is all true.\"    \"Of course it's true!\" snapped Little Joe Otter. \"Don't you believe I'm  telling the truth?\"    \"Certainly, certainly. Of course no one doubts your word,\" replied  Blacky, with the utmost politeness. \"But you say yourself that Farmer  Brown's boy didn't see Buster Bear, but only his footprint. Perhaps he  didn't know whose it was, and if he had he wouldn't have been afraid.  Now I've got a plan by which we can see for ourselves if he really is  afraid of Buster Bear.\"    \"What is it?\" asked Sammy Jay eagerly.    Blacky the Crow shook his head and winked. \"That's telling,\" said he. \"I  want to think it over. If you meet me at the Big Hickory-tree at sun-up  to-morrow morning, and get everybody else to come that you can, perhaps  I will tell you.\"          XI    BLACKY THE CROW TELLS HIS PLAN        Blacky is a dreamer!

[9] _Antiquities_, book viii. 2. Whiston's transl.    The Jewish ideas of good or at least evil spirits or angels were  acquired during their forced residence in Babylon, whether under  Assyrian or Persian government. At least 'Satan' is first  discovered unmistakably in a personal form in the poem of Job, a  work pronounced by critics to have been composed after the  restoration. In the Mosaic cosmogony and legislation, the writer  introduces not, expressly or impliedly, the existence of an evil  principle, unless the serpent of the Paradisaic account, which  has been rather arbitrarily so metamorphosed, represents it;[10]  while the expressions in books vulgarly reputed before the  conquest are at least doubtful. From this time forward (from the  fifth century B.C.), says a German demonologist, as the Jews  lived among the admirers of Zoroaster, and thus became acquainted  with their doctrines, are found, partly in contradiction to the  earlier views of their religion, many tenets prevailing amongst  them the origin of which it is impossible to explain except by  the operation of the doctrines of Zoroaster: to these belongs the  general acceptance of the theory of Satan, as well as of good and  bad angels.[11] Under Roman government or vassalage, sorceric  practices, as they appear in the Christian scriptures, were much  in vogue. Devils or demons, and the 'prince of the devils,'  frequently appear; and the _demoniacs_ may represent the victims  of witchcraft. The Talmud, if there is any truth in the  assertions of the apologists of witchcraft, commemorates many of  the most virtuous Jews accused of the crime and executed by the  procurator of Judea.[12] Exorcism was a very popular and  lucrative profession.[13] Simon Magus the magician (_par  excellence_), the impious pretender to miraculous powers, who  'bewitched the people of Samaria by his sorceries,' is celebrated  by Eusebius and succeeding Christian writers as the fruitful  parent of heresy and sorcery.      [10] Some ingenious remarks on the subject of the serpent,    &c., may be found in _Eastern Life_, part ii. 5, by H.    Martineau.      [11] Horst, quoted in Ennemoser's _History of Magic_. It has    been often remarked as a singular phenomenon, that the    'chosen people,' so prompt in earlier periods on every    occasion to idolatry and its cruel rites, after its    restoration under Persian auspices, has been ever since    uniformly opposed, even fiercely, to any sign contrary to the    unity of the Deity. But the Magian system was equally averse    to idolatry.      [12] Bishop Jewell (_Apology for the Church of England_)    states that Christ was accused by the malice of his    countrymen of being a juggler and wizard--_praestigiator et    maleficus_. In the apostolic narrative and epistles, sorcery,    witchcraft, &c., are crimes frequently described and    denounced. The Sadducean sect alone denied the existence of    demons.      [13] The common belief of the people of Palestine in the    transcendent power of exorcism is illustrated by a miracle    of this sort, gravely related by Josephus. It was exhibited    before Vespasian and his army. 'He [Eleazar, one of the    professional class] put a ring that had a root of one of    those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the    demoniac; after which he drew out the demon through his    nostrils: and when the man fell down immediately he adjured    him to return into him no more, making still mention of    Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed.    And when Eleazar would demonstrate to the spectators that he    had such power, he set a little way off a cup or basin full    of water, and commanded the demon as he went out of the man    to overturn it, and thereby to let the spectators know he    had left the man.' This performance was received with    contempt or credulity by the spectators according to their    faith: but the credulity of the believers could hardly    exceed that of a large number of educated people, who in our    own generation detect in the miracles of animal magnetism,    or the legerdemain of jugglers, an infernal or supernatural    agency.    That witchcraft, or whatever term expresses the criminal  practice, prevailed among the worshippers of Jehovah, is evident  from the repeated anathemas both in their own and the Christian  scriptures, not to speak of traditional legends; but the Hebrew  and Greek expressions seem both to include at least the use of  drugs and perhaps of poison.[14] The Jewish creed, as exposed in  their scriptures, has deserved a fame it would not otherwise  have, because upon it have been founded by theologians, Catholic  and Protestant, the arguments and apology for the reality of  witchcraft, derived from the sacred writings, with an ingenuity  only too common and successful in supporting peculiar prejudices  and interests even of the most monstrous kind.[15]      [14] _Chashaph_ and _Pharmakeia._ Biblical critics are    inclined, however, to accept in its strict sense the    translation of the Jacobian divines. 'Since in the LXX.,'    says Parkhurst, the lexicographer of the N.T., 'this noun    [pharmakeia] and its relatives always answer to some Hebrew    word that denotes some kind of their magical or conjuring    tricks; and since it is too notorious to be insisted upon,    that such infernal practices have always prevailed, and do    still prevail in idolatrous countries, I prefer the other    sense of incantation.'      [15] A sort of ingenuity much exercised of late by 'sober    brows approving with a text' the institution of slavery:    _divine_, according to them; _the greatest evil that afflicts    mankind_, according to Alexander von Humboldt. See _Personal    Narrative_.    In examining the phenomenon as it existed among the Greeks and  Romans, it will be remarked that, while the Greeks seem to have  mainly adopted the ideas of the East, the Roman superstition was  of Italian origin. Their respective expressions for the  predictive or presentient faculty (_manteia_ and _divinatio_), as  Cicero is careful to explain, appear to indicate its different  character with those two peoples: the one being the product of a  sort of madness, the other an elaborate and divine skill. Greek  traditions made them believe that the magic science was brought  from Egypt or Asia by their old philosophic and legislating  sages. Some of the most eminent of the founders of philosophic  schools were popularly accused of encouraging it. Pythagoras (it  is the complaint of Plato) is said to have introduced to his  countrymen an art derived from his foreign travels; a charge  which recalls the names of Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, Galileo,  and others, who had to pay the penalty of a premature knowledge  by the suspicion of their cotemporaries. Xenophanes is said  to be the only one of the philosophers who admitted the existence  or providence of the gods, and at the same time entirely  discredited divination. Of the Stoics, Panaetius was the only one  who ventured even to doubt. Some gave credit to one or two  particular modes only, as those of dreams and frenzy; but for the  most part every form of this sort of divine revelation was  implicitly received.[16]      [16] Cicero, in his second book _De Divinatione_, undertakes    to refute the arguments of the Stoics, 'the force of whose    mind, being all turned to the side of morals, unbent itself    in that of religion.' The divining faculty is divisible    generally into the artificial and the natural.    The science of magic proper is developed in the later schools of  philosophy, in which Oriental theology or demonology was largely  mixed. Apollonius of Tyana, a modern Pythagorean, is the most  famous magician of antiquity. This great miracle-worker of  paganism was born at the commencement of the Christian era; and  it has been observed that his miracles, though quite independent  of them, curiously coincide both in time and kind with the  Christian.[17] According to his biographer Philostratus, this  extraordinary man (whose travels and researches extended, we are  assured, over the whole East even into India, through Greece,  Italy, Spain, northern Africa, Ethiopia, &c.) must have been in  possession of a scientific knowledge which, compared with that of  his cotemporaries, might be deemed almost supernatural.  Extraordinary attainments suggested to him in later life to  excite the awe of the vulgar by investing himself with magical  powers. Apollonius is said to have assisted Vespasian in his  struggle for the throne of the Caesars; afterwards, when accused  of raising an insurrection against Domitian, and when he had  given himself up voluntarily to the imperial tribunal at Rome, he  escaped impending destruction by the exertion of his superhuman  art.      [17] The proclamation of the birth of Apollonius to his    mother by Proteus, and the incarnation of Proteus himself,    the chorus of swans which sang for joy on the occasion, the    casting out of devils, raising the dead, and healing the    sick, the sudden appearances and disappearances of    Apollonius, his adventures in the cave of Trophonius, and    the sacred voice which called him at his death, to which may    be added his claim as a teacher having authority to reform    the world, 'cannot fail to suggest,' says a writer in the    _Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography_, &c., ed. by Dr.    W. Smith, 'the parallel passages in the Gospel history.'    Of the incantations, charms, and magic compounds in the practice  of Greek witchcraft, numerous examples occur in the tragic and  comic poetry of Greece; and the _philtres_, or love-charms, of  Theocritus are well"]]]
