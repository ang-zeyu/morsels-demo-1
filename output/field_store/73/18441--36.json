[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#4)"],[1," separation was followed by similar demonstrations of sorrow,  which, however, again yielded to time. Three years passed, and the  wolf was living happily in company with a dog, which had been placed  with him, when his master again returned, and again the long-lost but  still-remembered voice was instantly replied to by the most impatient  cries, which were redoubled as soon as the poor animal was set at  liberty; when, rushing to his master, he threw his fore-feet on his  shoulders, licking his face with the most lively joy, and menacing his  keepers, who offered to remove him, and towards whom, not a moment  before, he had been showing every mark of fondness.    A third separation, however, seemed to be too much for this faithful  animal's temper. He became gloomy, desponding, refused his food, and  for a long time his life appeared in great danger. His health at last  returned, but he no longer suffered the caresses of any but his  keepers, and towards strangers manifested the original savageness of  his species.    Mr. Bell, in his \"History of Quadrupeds,\" mentions a curious fact,  which, I think, still more strongly proves the alliance of the dog  with the wolf, and is indeed exactly similar to what is frequently  done by dogs when in a state of domestication. He informs us, that he  \"remembers a bitch-wolf at the Zoological Gardens, which would always  come to the front bars of her den to be caressed as soon as he, or any  other person whom she knew, approached. When she had pups, she used to  bring them in her mouth to be noticed; and so eager, in fact, was she  that her little ones should share with her in the notice of her  friends, that she killed all of them in succession by rubbing them  against the bars of her den, as she brought them forwards to be  fondled.\"    Other instances might be mentioned of the strong attachment felt by  wolves to those who have treated them kindly, but I will now introduce  some remarks on the anatomical affinities between the dog, the fox,  and the wolf, which serve to prove that the dog is of a breed distinct  from either of the last-mentioned animals.    It must, in fact, be always an interesting matter of inquiry  respecting the descent of an animal so faithful to man, and so  exclusively his associate and his friend, as the dog. Accordingly,  this question has been entertained ever since Natural History took the  rank of a science. But the origin of the dog is lost in antiquity. We  find him occupying a place in the earliest pagan worship; his name has  been given to one of the first-mentioned stars of the heavens, and his  effigy may be seen in some of the most ancient works of art. Pliny was  of opinion that there was no domestic animal without its unsubdued  counterpart, and dogs are known to exist absolutely wild in various  parts of the old and new world. The Dingo of New Holland, a  magnificent animal of this kind, has been shown to be susceptible of  mutual attachment in a singular degree, though none of the experiments  yet made have proved that he is capable, like the domestic dog, of a  similar attachment to man. The parentage of the wild dogs has been  assigned to the tame species, strayed from the dominion of their  masters. This, however, still remains a question, and there is reason  to believe that the wild dog is just as much a native of the  wilderness as the lion or tiger. If there be these doubts about an  animal left for centuries in a state of nature, how can we expect to  unravel the difficulties accumulated by ages of domestication? Who  knows for a certainty the true prototype of the goat, the sheep, or  the ox? To the unscientific reader such questions might appear idle,  as having been settled from time immemorial; yet they have never been  finally disposed of. The difficulty, as with the dog, may be connected  with modifications of form and colour, resulting from the  long-continued interference of man with the breed and habits of  animals subjected to his sway.    Buffon was very eloquent in behalf of the claim of the sheep-dog to be  considered as the true ancestor of all the other varieties. Mr. Hunter  would award this distinction to the wolf; supposing also that the  jackal is the same animal a step further advanced towards  civilization, or perhaps the dog returned to its wild state. As the  affinity between wolf, jackal, fox, and dog, cannot fail to attract  the notice of the most superficial observer; so he may ask if they do  not all really belong to one species, modified by varieties of  climate, food, and education? If answered in the negative, he would  want to know what constitutes a species, little thinking that this  question, apparently so simple, involves one of the nicest problems in  natural history. Difference of form will scarcely avail us here, for  the pug, greyhound, and spaniel, are wider apart in this respect, than  many dogs and the wild animals just named. It has often been said that  these varieties in the dog have arisen from artificial habits and  breeding through a long succession of years. This seems very like mere  conjecture. Can the greyhound be trained to the pointer's scent or the  spaniel to the bulldog's ferocity? But admitting the causes assigned  to be adequate to the effects, then the forms would be temporary, and  those of a permanent kind only would serve our purpose. Of this nature  is the shape of the pupil of the eye, which may be noticed somewhat  particularly, not merely to make it plain to those who have never  thought on the subject, but with the hope of leading them to  reflections on this wondrous inlet to half our knowledge, the more  especially as the part in question may be examined by any one in his  own person by the help of a looking-glass. In the front of the eye  then, just behind the transparent surface, there is a sort of curtain  called the _iris_, about the middle of which is a round hole. This is  the pupil, and you will observe that it contracts in a strong light,  and dilates in a weaker one, the object of which is to regulate the  quantity of light admitted into the eye. Now the figure of the pupil  is not the same in all animals. In the horse it is oval; in the wolf,  jackal, and dog, it is round, like our own, however contracted; but in  the fox, as in the cat, the pupil contracts vertically into an  elongated figure, like the section of a lens, and even to a sort of  slit, if the light be very strong.    This is a permanent character, not affected, as far as is at present  known, by any artificial or natural circumstances to which the dog has  been subjected. Naturalists, therefore, have seized upon this  character as the ground for a division of animals of the dog kind, the  great genus _Canis_ of Linnaeus, into two groups, the diurnal and  nocturnal; not to imply that these habits necessarily belong to all  the individuals composing either of these divisions, for that would be  untrue, but simply that the figure of the pupils corresponds with that  frequently distinguishing day-roaming animals from those that prowl  only by night. It is remarkable that a more certain and serviceable  specific distinction is thus afforded by a little anatomical point,  than by any of the more obvious circumstances of form, size, or  colour. Whether future researches into the minute structure of animals  may not discover other means to assist the naturalist in  distinguishing nearly allied species, is a most important subject for  inquiry, which cannot be entertained here. But to encourage those who  may be disposed to undertake it, I must mention the curious fact, that  the group to which the camel belongs is not more certainly indicated  by his grotesque and singular figure than by the form of the red  particles which circulate in his blood. And here again the inherent  interest of the matter will lead me to enter a little into  particulars, which may engage any one who has a good microscope in a  most instructive course of observations, not the least recommendation  of which is, that a just and pleasing source of recreation may be thus  pursued by evening parties in the drawing-room, since the slightest  prick of the finger will furnish blood enough for a microscopic  entertainment, and you may readily procure a little more for  comparison from any animal.    Now the redness of the blood is owing to myriads of minute objects in  which the colour of the vital fluid resides. They were formerly called  globules, but as they are now known to be flattened and disc-like,  they are more properly termed particles or corpuscles. Their form is  wonderfully regular, and so is their size within certain limits; in  birds, reptiles, or fishes, the corpuscles are oval. They are circular  in man, and all other mammalia, except in the camel tribe, in which  the corpuscles are oval, though much smaller than in the lower  animals. Thus, in the minutest drop of blood, any one of the camel  family can be surely distinguished from all other animals, even from  its allies among the ruminants; and what is more to our purpose,  in pursuing this inquiry, Mr. Gulliver has found that the  blood-corpuscles of the dog and wolf agree exactly, while those of all  the true foxes are slightly though distinctly smaller.    These curious facts are all fully detailed in Mr. Gulliver's Appendix  to the English version of Gerber's Anatomy, but I think that they are  now for the first time enlisted into the service of Natural History.    Thus we dismiss the fox as an alien to the dog, or, at all events, as  a distinct species. Then comes the claim of the wolf as the true  original of the dog. Before considering this, let us revert to the  question of what constitutes a species. Mr. Hunter was of opinion that  it is the power of breeding together and of continuing the breed with  each other; that this is partially the case between the dog and the  wolf is certain, for Lord Clanbrassil and Lord Pembroke proved the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#4)"],[1," eight consecutive  spot-periods the spots were most numerous when Jupiter was farthest from  the sun, and it is only by going back to the periods preceding these  eight that we find a time when the reverse happened, the spots being  most numerous when Jupiter was nearest to the sun. So with various other  periods which the ingenuity of Messrs. De la Rue and Balfour Stewart has  detected, and which, under the closest scrutiny, exhibit almost exact  agreement for many successive periods, preceded and followed by almost  exact disagreement. Here, again, the captious may argue that such  alternate agreements and disagreements may be noted in every case where  two periods are not very unequal, whether there be any connection  between them or not; but much more frequently when there is no  connection: and that the only evidence really proving a connection  between planetary motions and the solar spots would be constant  agreement between solar spot periods and particular planetary periods.  But the progress of science, and especially the possible erection of a  new observatory for finding out ('for a consideration') how sun-spots  affect the weather, etc., ought not to be interfered with by captious  reasoners in this objectionable manner. Nor need any other answer be  given them. Seeing, then, that sun-spots manifestly affect the weather  and the seasons, while the planets rule the sun-spots, it is clear that  the planets really rule the seasons. And again, seeing that the planets  rule the seasons, while the seasons largely affect the well-being of men  and nations (to say nothing of animals), it follows that the planets  influence the fates of men and nations (and animals). _Quod erat  demonstrandum._    Let us return, however, to the more reasonable astrology of the  ancients, and enquire into some of the traditions which Bacon considered  worthy of attention in framing the precepts of a sound and just  astrology.    It was natural that the astrologers of old should regard the planetary  influences as depending in the main on the position of the celestial  bodies on the sky above the person or place whose fortunes were in  question. Thus two men at the same moment in Rome and in Persia would by  no means have the same horoscope cast for their nativities, so that  their fortunes, according to the principles of judicial astrology, would  be quite different. In fact it might happen that two men, born at the  same instant of time, would have all the principal circumstances of  their lives contrasted--planets riding high in the heavens of one being  below the horizon of the other, and _vice versa_.    The celestial sphere placed as at the moment of the native's birth was  divided into twelve parts by great circles supposed to pass through the  point overhead, and its opposite, the point vertically beneath the feet.  These twelve divisions were called 'houses.'    Their position is illustrated in the following figure, taken from  Raphael's Astrology.    [Illustration:      Particular Significations    OF THE    _Twelve Celestial Houses_,    According to various    Astrological Authors.      Sun-rise.      Cusp of the    _Ascendant_.

FRIENDS      Cusp of the    _Twelfth House_.      ENEMIES    ]    The first, called the Ascendant House, was the portion rising above the  horizon at the east. It was regarded as the House of Life, the planets  located therein at the moment of birth having most potent influence on  the life and destiny of the native. Such planets were said to rule the  ascendant, being in the ascending house; and it is from this usage that  our familiar expression that such and such an influence is 'in the  ascendant' is derived. The next house was the House of Riches, and was  one-third of the way from the east below the horizon towards the place  of the sun at midnight. The third was the House of Kindred, short  journeys, letters, messages, etc. It was two-thirds of the way towards  the place of the midnight sun. The fourth was the House of Parents, and  was the house which the sun reached at midnight. The fifth was the House  of Children and Women, also of all sorts of amusements, theatres,  banquets, and merry-making. The sixth was the House of Sickness. The  seventh was the House of Love and Marriage. These three houses (the  fifth, sixth, and seventh) followed in order from the fourth, so as to  correspond to the part of the sun's path below the horizon, between his  place at midnight and his place when descending in the west. The  seventh, opposite to the first, was the Descendant. The eighth house was  the first house above the horizon, lying to the west, and was the House  of Death. The ninth house, next to the mid-heaven on the west, was the  House of Religion, science, learning, books, and long voyages. The  tenth, which was in the mid-heaven, or region occupied by the sun at  midday, was the House of Honour, denoting credit, renown, profession or  calling, trade, preferment, etc. The eleventh house, next to the  mid-heaven on the east, was the House of Friends. Lastly, the twelfth  house was the House of Enemies.    The houses were not all of equal potency. The _angular_ houses, which  are the first, the fourth, the seventh, and the tenth--lying east,  north, west, and south--were first in power, whether for good or evil.  The second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh houses were called _succedents_,  as following the angular houses, and next to them in power. The  remaining four houses--viz. the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth  houses--were called _cadents_, and were regarded as weakest in  influence. The houses were regarded as alternately masculine and  feminine: the first, third, fifth, etc., being masculine; while the  second, fourth, sixth, etc., were feminine.    The more particular significations of the various houses are shown in  the accompanying figure from the same book.

The position of the planets at the moment  of the native's birth, in the several houses, determined his fortunes  with regard to the various matters associated with these houses. Thus  planets of good influence in the native's ascendant, or first house,  signified generally a prosperous life; but if at the same epoch a planet  of malefic influence was in the seventh house, then the native, though  on the whole prosperous, would be unfortunate in marriage. A good planet  in the tenth house signified good fortune and honour in office or  business, and generally a prosperous career as distinguished from a  happy life; but evil planets in the ninth house would suggest to the  native caution in undertaking long voyages, or entering upon religious  or scientific controversies.
