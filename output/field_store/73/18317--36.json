To be alone in a crowd is very solitary. In the woods, I feel  sympathy with the trees and birds, in whose company I take delight, but  experience no pleasure in a strange crowd. I hope you are all well and  will continue so, and, therefore, must again urge you to be very prudent  and careful of those dear children. If I could only get a squeeze at  that little fellow, turning up his sweet mouth to 'keese baba!' You  must not let him run wild in my absence, and will have to exercise  firm authority over all of them. This will not require severity or even  strictness, but constant attention and an unwavering course. Mildness  and forbearance will strengthen their affection for you, while it will  maintain your control over them.\"    In a letter to one of his sons he writes as follows:    \"I cannot go to bed, my dear son, without writing you a few lines,  to thank you for your letter, which gave me great pleasure....You and  Custis must take great care of your kind mother and dear sisters when  your father is dead. To do that you must learn to be good. Be true,  kind and generous, and pray earnestly to God to enable you to keep His  Commandments 'and walk in the same all the days of your life.' I hope to  come on soon to see that little baby you have got to show me. You must  give her a kiss for me, and one to all the children, to your mother, and  grandmother\"    The expression of such sentiments as these was common to my father all  through his life, and to show that it was all children, and not his own  little folk alone that charmed and fascinated him, I quote from a letter  to my mother:    \"...I saw a number of little girls all dressed up in their white frocks  and pantalets, their hair plaited and tied up with ribbons, running and  chasing each other in all directions. I counted twenty-three nearly the  same size. As I drew up my horse to admire the spectacle, a man appeared  at the door with the twenty-fourth in his arms.    \"'My friend,' said I, 'are all these your children?'    \"'Yes,' he said, 'and there are nine more in the house, and this is the  youngest.'    \"Upon further inquiry, however, I found that they were only temporarily  his, and that they were invited to a party at his house. He said,  however, he had been admiring them before I came up, and just wished  that he had a million of dollars, and that they were all his in reality.  I do not think the eldest exceeded seven or eight years old. It was the  prettiest sight I have seen in the west, and, perhaps, in my life....\"    As Superintendent of the Military Academy at West Point my father had  to entertain a good deal, and I remember well how handsome and grand he  looked in uniform, how genial and bright, how considerate of everybody's  comfort of mind and body. He was always a great favourite with the  ladies, especially the young ones. His fine presence, his gentle,  courteous manners and kindly smile put them at once at ease with him.    Among the cadets at this time were my eldest brother, Custis, who  graduated first in his class in 1854, and my father's nephew, Fitz. Lee,  a third classman, besides other relatives and friends. Saturday being a  half-holiday for the cadets, it was the custom for all social events in  which they were to take part to be placed on that afternoon or evening.  Nearly every Saturday a number of these young men were invited to our  house to tea, or supper, for it was a good, substantial meal. The misery  of some of these lads, owing to embarrassment, possibly from awe of the  Superintendent, was pitiable and evident even to me, a boy of ten or  eleven years old. But as soon as my father got command, as it were, of  the situation, one could see how quickly most of them were put at  their ease. He would address himself to the task of making them feel  comfortable and at home, and his genial manner and pleasant ways at once  succeeded.    In the spring of '53 my grandmother, Mrs. Custis, died. This was the  first death in our immediate family. She was very dear to us, and was  admired, esteemed and loved by all who had ever known her. Bishop Meade,  of Virginia, writes of her:    \"Mrs. Mary Custis, of Arlington, the wife of Mr. Washington Custis,  grandson of Mrs. General Washington was the daughter of Mr. William  Fitzhugh, of Chatham. Scarcely is there a Christian lady in our land  more honoured than she was, and none more loved and esteemed. For good  sense, prudence, sincerity, benevolence, unaffected piety, disinterested  zeal in every good work, deep humanity and retiring modesty--for all the  virtues which adorn the wife, the mother, and the friend--I never knew  her superior.\"    In a letter written to my mother soon after this sad event my father  says:    \"May God give you strength to enable you to bear and say, 'His will  be done.' She has gone from all trouble, care and sorrow to a holy  immortality, there to rejoice and praise forever the God and Saviour  she so long and truly served. Let that be our comfort and that our  consolation. May our death be like hers, and may we meet in happiness in  Heaven.\"    In another letter about the same time he writes:    \"She was to me all that a mother could be, and I yield to none in  admiration for her character, love for her virtues, and veneration for  her memory.\"    At this time, my father's family and friends persuaded him to allow R.  S. Weir, Professor of Painting and Drawing at the Academy, to paint  his portrait. As far as I remember, there was only one sitting, and the  artist had to finish it from memory or from the glimpses he obtained as  his subject in the regular course of their daily lives at \"The Point.\"  This picture shows my father in the undress uniform of a Colonel of  Engineers [His appointment of Superintendent of the Military Academy  carried with it the temporary rank of Colonel of Engineers], and  many think it a very good likeness. To me, the expression of strength  peculiar to his face is wanting, and the mouth fails to portray that  sweetness of disposition so characteristic of his countenance. Still,  it was like him at that time. My father never could bear to have his  picture taken, and there are no likenesses of him that really give his  sweet expression. Sitting for a picture was such a serious business with  him that he never could \"look pleasant.\"    In 1855 my father was appointed to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the  Second Cavalry, one of the two regiments just raised. He left West Point  to enter upon his new duties, and his family went to Arlington to live.  During the fall and winter of 1855 and '56, the Second Cavalry was  recruited and organised at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, under the  direction of Colonel Lee, and in the following spring was marched to  western Texas, where it was assigned the duty of protecting the settlers  in that wild country.    I did not see my father again until he came to my mother at Arlington  after the death of her father, G. W. P. Custis, in October 1857. He took  charge of my mother's estate after her father's death, and commenced at  once to put it in order--not an easy task, as it consisted of several  plantations and many negroes. I was at a boarding-school, after  the family returned to Arlington, and saw my father only during the  holidays, if he happened to be at home. He was always fond of farming,  and took great interest in the improvements he immediately began at  Arlington relating to the cultivation of the farm, to the buildings,  roads, fences, fields, and stock, so that in a very short time the  appearance of everything on the estate was improved. He often said that  he longed for the time when he could have a farm of his own, where  he could end his days in quiet and peace, interested in the care and  improvement of his own land. This idea was always with him. In a letter  to his son, written in July, '65, referring to some proposed indictments  of prominent Confederates, he says:    \"...As soon as I can ascertain their intention toward me, if not  prevented, I shall endeavour to procure some humble, but quiet abode  for your mother and sisters, where I hope they can be happy. As I before  said, I want to get in some grass country where the natural product of  the land will do much for my subsistence....\"    Again in a letter to his son, dated October, 1865, after he had accepted  the presidency of Washington College, Lexington, Virginia:    \"I should have selected a more quiet life and a more retired abode than  Lexington. I should have preferred a small farm, where I could have  earned my daily bread.\"    About this time I was given a gun of my own and was allowed to go  shooting by myself. My father, to give me an incentive, offered a reward  for every crow-scalp I could bring him, and, in order that I might get  to work at once, advanced a small sum with which to buy powder and shot,  this sum to be returned to him out of the first scalps obtained. My  industry and zeal were great, my hopes high, and by good luck I did  succeed in bagging two crows about the second time I went out. I showed  them with great pride to my father, intimating that I should shortly be  able to return him his loan, and that he must be prepared to hand over  to me very soon further rewards for my skill. His eyes twinkled, and his  smile showed that he had strong doubts of my making an income by killing  crows, and he was right, for I never killed another, though I tried hard  and long.    I saw but little of my father after we left West Point. He went to  Texas, as I have stated, in '55 and remained until the fall of '57, the  time of my grandfather's death. He was then at Arlington about a year.  Returning to his regiment, he remained in Texas until the autumn of '59,  when he came again to Arlington, having applied for leave in order to  finish the settling of my grandfather's estate. During this visit he  was selected by the Secretary of War to suppress the famous \"John Brown"]]]
