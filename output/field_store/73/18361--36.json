[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24350"],[0,"Kerfol (#4)"],[1,"must  have sent a smile around the court. She said it was because she was  lonely and wanted to talk with the young man. Was this the only reason?  she was asked; and replied: \"Yes, by the Cross over your Lordships'  heads.\" \"But why at midnight?\" the court asked. \"Because I could see him  in no other way.\" I can see the exchange of glances across the ermine  collars under the Crucifix.    Anne de Cornault, further questioned, said that her married life had  been extremely lonely: \"desolate\" was the word she used. It was true  that her husband seldom spoke harshly to her; but there were days  when he did not speak at all. It was true that he had never struck or  threatened her; but he kept her like a prisoner at Kerfol, and when he  rode away to Morlaix or Quimper or Rennes he set so close a watch on  her that she could not pick a flower in the garden without having a  waiting-woman at her heels. \"I am no Queen, to need such honours,\" she  once said to him; and he had answered that a man who has a treasure does  not leave the key in the lock when he goes out. \"Then take me with you,\"  she urged; but to this he said that towns were pernicious places, and  young wives better off at their own firesides.    \"But what did you want to say to Herve de Lanrivain?\" the court asked;  and she answered: \"To ask him to take me away.\"    \"Ah--you confess that you went down to him with adulterous thoughts?\"    \"Then why did you want him to take you away?\"    \"Because I was afraid for my life.\"    \"Of whom were you afraid?\"    \"Of my husband.\"    \"Why were you afraid of your husband?\"    \"Because he had strangled my little dog.\"    Another smile must have passed around the courtroom: in days when any  nobleman had a right to hang his peasants--and most of them exercised  it--pinching a pet animal's wind-pipe was nothing to make a fuss about.    At this point one of the Judges, who appears to have had a certain  sympathy for the accused, suggested that she should be allowed to  explain herself in her own way; and she thereupon made the following  statement.    The first years of her marriage had been lonely; but her husband had  not been unkind to her. If she had had a child she would not have been  unhappy; but the days were long, and it rained too much.    It was true that her husband, whenever he went away and left her,  brought her a handsome present on his return; but this did not make up  for the loneliness. At least nothing had, till he brought her the little  brown dog from the East: after that she was much less unhappy. Her  husband seemed pleased that she was so fond of the dog; he gave her  leave to put her jewelled bracelet around its neck, and to keep it  always with her.    One day she had fallen asleep in her room, with the dog at her feet, as  his habit was. Her feet were bare and resting on his back. Suddenly she  was waked by her husband: he stood beside her, smiling not unkindly.    \"You look like my great-grandmother, Juliane de Cornault, lying in the  chapel with her feet on a little dog,\" he said.    The analogy sent a chill through her, but she laughed and answered:  \"Well, when I am dead you must put me beside her, carved in marble, with  my dog at my feet.\"    \"Oho--we'll wait and see,\" he said, laughing also, but with his black  brows close together. \"The dog is the emblem of fidelity.\"    \"And do you doubt my right to lie with mine at my feet?\"    \"When I'm in doubt I find out,\" he answered. \"I am an old man,\" he  added, \"and people say I make you lead a lonely life. But I swear you  shall have your monument if you earn it.\"    \"And I swear to be faithful,\" she returned, \"if only for the sake of  having my little dog at my feet.\"    Not long afterward he went on business to the Quimper Assizes; and while  he was away his aunt, the widow of a great nobleman of the duchy, came  to spend a night at Kerfol on her way to the _pardon_ of Ste. Barbe.  She was a woman of piety and consequence, and much respected by Yves de  Cornault, and when she proposed to Anne to go with her to Ste. Barbe no  one could object, and even the chaplain declared himself in favour of  the pilgrimage. So Anne set out for Ste. Barbe, and there for the first  time she talked with Herve de Lanrivain. He had come once or twice to  Kerfol with his father, but she had never before exchanged a dozen words  with him. They did not talk for more than five minutes now: it was under  the chestnuts, as the procession was coming out of the chapel. He said:  \"I pity you,\" and she was surprised, for she had not supposed that any  one thought her an object of pity. He added: \"Call for me when you need  me,\" and she smiled a little, but was glad afterward, and thought often  of the meeting.    She confessed to having seen him three times afterward: not more. How  or where she would not say--one had the impression that she feared to  implicate some one. Their meetings had been rare and brief; and at the  last he had told her that he was starting the next day for a foreign  country, on a mission which was not without peril and might keep him for  many months absent. He asked her for a remembrance, and she had none  to give him but the collar about the little dog's neck. She was sorry  afterward that she had given it, but he was so unhappy at going that she  had not had the courage to refuse.    Her husband was away at the time. When he returned a few days later he  picked up the animal to pet it, and noticed that its collar was missing.  His wife told him that the dog had lost it in the undergrowth of the  park, and that she and her maids had hunted a whole day for it. It was  true, she explained to the court, that she had made the maids search for  the necklet--they all believed the dog had lost it in the park....    Her husband made no comment, and that evening at supper he was in his  usual mood, between good and bad: you could never tell which. He talked  a good deal, describing what he had seen and done at Rennes; but now  and then he stopped and looked hard at her, and when she went to bed she  found her little dog strangled on her pillow. The little thing was  dead, but still warm; she stooped to lift it, and her distress turned to  horror when she discovered that it had been strangled by twisting twice  round its throat the necklet she had given to Lanrivain.    The next morning at dawn she buried the dog in the garden, and hid the  necklet in her breast. She said nothing to her husband, then or later,  and he said nothing to her; but that day he had a peasant hanged for  stealing a faggot in the park, and the next day he nearly beat to death  a young horse he was breaking.    Winter set in, and the short days passed, and the long nights, one by  one; and she heard nothing of Herve de Lanrivain. It might be that  her husband had killed him; or merely that he had been robbed of the  necklet. Day after day by the hearth among the spinning maids, night  after night alone on her bed, she wondered and trembled. Sometimes at  table her husband looked across at her and smiled; and then she felt  sure that Lanrivain was dead. She dared not try to get news of him, for  she was sure her husband would find out if she did: she had an idea that  he could find out anything. Even when a witchwoman who was a noted seer,  and could show you the whole world in her crystal, came to the castle  for a night's shelter, and the maids flocked to her, Anne held back.    The winter was long and black and rainy. One day, in Yves de Cornault's  absence, some gypsies came to Kerfol with a troop of performing dogs.  Anne bought the smallest and cleverest, a white dog with a feathery coat  and one blue and one brown eye. It seemed to have been ill-treated by  the gypsies, and clung to her plaintively when she took it from them.  That evening her husband came back, and when she went to bed she found  the dog strangled on her pillow.    After that she said to herself that she would never have another dog;  but one bitter cold evening a poor lean greyhound was found whining at  the castle-gate, and she took him in and forbade the maids to speak of  him to her husband. She hid him in a room that no one went to, smuggled  food to him from her own plate, made him a warm bed to lie on and petted  him like a child.    Yves de Cornault came home, and the next day she found the greyhound  strangled on her pillow. She wept in secret, but said nothing, and  resolved that even if she met a dog dying of hunger she would never  bring him into the castle; but one day she found a young sheepdog, a  brindled puppy with good blue eyes, lying with a broken leg in the snow  of the park. Yves de Cornault was at Bennes, and she brought the dog  in, warmed and fed it, tied up its leg and hid it in the castle till  her husband's return. The day before, she gave it to a peasant woman  who lived a long way off, and paid her handsomely to care for it and say  nothing; but that night she heard a whining and scratching at her door,  and when she opened it the lame puppy, drenched and shivering, jumped up  on her with little sobbing barks. She hid him in her bed, and the next  morning was about to have him taken back to the peasant woman when she  heard her husband ride into the court. She shut the dog in a chest, and  went down to receive him. An hour or two later, when she returned to her  room, the puppy lay strangled on her pillow....    After that she dared not make a pet of any other dog; and her loneliness  became almost unendurable. Sometimes, when she crossed the court of  the castle, and thought no one was looking, she stopped to pat the old  pointer at the gate. But one day as she was caressing him her husband  came out of the chapel; and the next day the old dog was gone....    This curious narrative was not told in one sitting of the court, or  received without impatience and incredulous comment. It was plain that  the Judges were surprised by its puerility, and that it did not help"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24384"],[0,"365 Luncheon Dishes: A Luncheon Dish for Every Day in the Year (#4)"],[1,"of this butter in the centre of each kidney  and serve hot.      10.--Beefsteak and Kidney Pudding.
