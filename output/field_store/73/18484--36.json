Four thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven of the last  yug expired in eighteen hundred and forty-three. The incredibility of  their chronology will be seen at a glance, if you recollect that it is  claimed that one of their sovereigns lived through the whole of the first  yug. Veda is a generic name for their four oldest and most sacred books,  containing simply a revelation directly from Brahma.    Many unbelievers in this, and the old world, who have set themselves  against our Bible, have indorsed the Vedas as scientific, without so much  as having read or known one line in them. These Vedas profess to go back  through _maha yugs_ of 4,320,000 years of men. A thousand of these _maha_  yugs, or 4,320,000,000 of years make a _kalpa_, or one day of the life of  Brahma, and his night is of equal length; a hundred such days and nights  measure the time of his life.    These books give, as facts, seven great continents, separated by that many  rivers and seven mountain-chains four hundred thousand miles high. They  record a hundred sons to one king, ten thousand to another, and sixty  thousand to another. These kings were in no danger from violating the  command to \"multiply and replenish the earth;\" but there is one  difficulty, at least, about the records concerning the seventy thousand  and one hundred sons born to these three kings, and that is this, the  records say: They were all born in a pumpkin and nourished in pans of  milk, reduced to ashes by the curse of a sage, and restored to life by the  waters of the Ganges. Those same sacred books say: The moon is fifty  thousand leagues higher than the sun, and that it shines by its own light  and animates our body; they say, the sun goes behind the Someyra Mountains  and this makes the night; they say, these mountains are many thousand  miles high, and are situated in the middle of our earth; they say, our  earth is flat and triangular, having seven stories, each one of peculiar  beauty, having its own inhabitants, and each one having a sea. The first  story of earth, they say, is composed of _honey_, the second is composed  of _sugar_, the third of _butter_, the fourth of _wine_; and the whole  thing is carried upon the heads of elephants, and when these shake  themselves earthquakes are produced. Among the astronomical calculations  which confirm all this there are accounts of floods of waters rising to  the Polar star. How is that for a flood?    Infidel, if you read this, and remember that you have been guilty of  foisting the Vedas against the Hebrew Scriptures, hide your face and do it  no more. The Hindoos worship cats and monkeys and holy bulls and sticks  and stones. They are yet sacrificing their infants in that sacred river,  _Ganges_. The car of Juggernaut, 'tis said, is yet rolling on its bloody  wheels, and women are yet burned upon the dead bodies of their husbands.  What is the trouble with those unfortunates? Well, they enjoy freedom from  the Bible, freedom from the Bible God, and freedom from the Protestant and  Catholic clergy--the freedom that the infidels of the United States concern  themselves so much about. Give them what they plead for and it will not be  long until they will have more hell than they will love or worship.  Infidels boast of the worth of the writings of Confucius and the religion  of the Chinese. Let us look after their condition. Here it is, as given in  the Universal Vocabulary. As they are esteemed by unbelievers so ancient  as to put to shame all others pretending to antiquity, we must be allowed  to make the test of their religious and scientific tree by its fruits.  First. \"If a person be suspected of treason he is put to death in a slow  and painful manner, all his relations in the first degree are beheaded,  his female relations sold into slavery, and all his connections residing  in his house are put to death. If a physician treat the case of a patient  in any way different from established rules, and the patient dies, he is  treated as guilty of homicide, though, if on his trial it be shown that it  was a mere error, he is redeemed from death, but must quit his practice  forever. When a debtor is unable to meet the demand of his creditor he  receives thirty blows, and the same number may be repeated from time to  time till the debt is paid. In case the creditor violently seize the  debtor's goods he is liable to eighty blows. In order to the collection of  debts, it is customary for creditors to enter the houses of their debtors  on the first day of the year and pronounce their claims with a loud voice,  and continue there until they are reimbursed. It is said that this teazing  proves a successful method of collecting debts; inasmuch as the debtor,  fearing that something may befall the creditor while in his house, and,  therefore, suspicion fall on him, he is moved to use all possible  endeavors to answer the demand. Women are sold in marriage and the highest  bidder takes them. Their government is patriarchial and despotic. The  emperor is styled Holy Son of Heaven, Sole Governor of the Earth. Their  religion is paganism.\"    Zell's Encyclopedia gives the following items as true to-day: \"Their  husbandry is, to a great extent, nullified by the rude and ill-adapted  implements employed therefor, and also by the smallness of the farms.  Hence, agriculture, as scientifically considered, is but little advanced.\"  The form of government is strictly patriarchial. The emperor, who bears  the various euphuistic titles of the \"Brother of the Sun and Moon.\"  _Teen-tsye_, or the \"Sun of Heaven;\" _Ta-hwang-li_, or the \"Great  Emperor;\" and _Wansuy-yay_, or the \"Lord of a Myriad Years,\" is regarded  as the father of his people, and has unlimited power over all his  subjects. The emperor is spiritual as well as temporal sovereign, and as  high priest of the empire, can alone, with his immediate representatives  and ministers, perform the great religious ceremonies. The bamboo, as the  chief instrument of government, is applied without distinction, to the  highest and lowest Chinese.    The imperial palaces are of great extent, consisting of a series of  courts, with galleries and halls of audience beautifully painted. The  temples differ greatly in form and size. The ordinary temples or  _joss-houses_, consist each of one chamber _containing an idol_. This,  gentle reader, is the store-house of pagan idolatry to which some  unbelievers in Indiana and elsewhere resort for names or titles by which  to designate the houses of Christian worship in our own country. How would  those men like to emigrate to China, where they could have a language that  suits their taste, and a literature and religion about which they have  boasted so much? If Chinese government, religion, and literature and  science be so old as is claimed by Chinamen, and by infidels in our  country, and its age be the cause of its great superiority in religion and  science, may we not thank the Lord that we are young?            ANCIENT COSMOGONIES.      The Mosaic method found in the first chapter of the book of Genesis is not  the method of physical science; this seeks, by induction, after laws,  principles and causes, stepping backwards step by step, seeking, by the  light of physical science, the character of that unit which lies at the  base of the whole series of all created things. \"The world by wisdom knew  not God.\" The truth of this statement is monumented by the literature of  the unbelievers of the nineteenth century. To-day, men who refuse Bible  instruction talk of the unknown and the unknowable, thus conceding that  their efforts as naturalists, or \"natural men,\" are not sufficient in  their results to disclose the character of the great first cause. The same  great failure has been, and ever will be, made by all mere naturalists. In  view of this fact it is well that Moses gives us at once the great first  cause in the phrase, \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the  earth.\" There is in this sentence no limitation of time, so there is room  here for astronomical ages, cycle upon cycle. There was time enough in  that beginning for the present system of planets to be arranged from a  single nebulous mass. In it we have a picture of matter in a crude  condition, without fixedness of form, surrounded with darkness. Then comes  the commencement of the great work of preparing our planet for the home of  man, by the spirit of God moving over the chaos. There is nothing in this  statement that should perplex any man, unless he is that fool who \"says in  his heart there is no God.\" If the chaos here described was matter in a  rare, gaseous condition, floating in space, molecular motion produced by  the spirit of God brooding over it, and a chemical change producing  electricity may have given the light called the first day.    Here is that troublesome word _day_. Why should it give trouble to any  scientist? It is a part of his duty to know that neither this word nor the  context in the first chapter of Genesis, nor biblical usage, requires us  to limit the term to a period of twenty-four hours. But the context does  limit it, in its first occurrence, to an indefinite period of _light_.  \"GOD CALLED THE LIGHT DAY!\" In the fourth verse of the second chapter the  word is used to cover the whole period of time past, both the beginning  and the subsequent six work-days of the Almighty, thus: \"These are the  generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, IN THE  DAY when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.\" This is no modern  invention, gotten up to serve a purpose; for Augustine so understood this  matter in the fourth century. He called them \"ineffable days,\" describing  them as alternate pauses in the work of God. Such was the interpretation  given by the first Christians. Why should we try to measure this term day,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28075"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, March, 1880 (#4)"],[1," to reason from your own conscious  knowledge upon the line of physical elements, as well as space and  duration, to the ideas of infinite matter, space, and duration. Do you not  know that there is also a line of vital and mental forces? Why is it that  you do not consider men equally scientific who reason upon that line from  conscious knowledge to the idea of an ever-living, all-powerful  intelligence? Power is a matter of conscious knowledge. Can you set limits  to it? No, never! Then power is infinite. Let us ever remember there is no  life without antecedent life; no mind without antecedent mind; and no  matter without antecedent substance. Where does power come from? Can you  tell? If you are a Theist you can. If you are an Atheist you can't.  Unbelievers say the Infinite One, if there be such, can not be revealed to  man. This conclusion is rested upon the assumption that the finite can not  comprehend the infinite. This is regarded as a complete overthrow of  revealed religion. Can nothing be revealed to me unless I can comprehend  it? Can I know nothing without comprehending it? I know load-stone, but do  I comprehend it? I know electricity, but do I comprehend it? I am  conscious of life and mind, but do I comprehend either? We know that  matter, of itself, is inert, dead, and yet it lives. But this is our  difficulty: How does it come to live? We know it lives, but do we  comprehend the fact? We know enough about a great many incomprehensible  things for all practical purposes. Do you unbelievers know the _unknown_?  If you don't, might it not be well to quit talking about it? Your language  is at fault. You are no more competent to talk about the _unknown_ than we  Christians. Turn that word _unknown_ out of doors and adopt the word  _incomprehensible_, and then talk about it, for it is revealed to all who  talk about it. You and I apprehend the INFINITE ONE. You talk about  infinite space, infinite duration, infinite substance. Yes, and I talk  about infinite life, infinite power and infinite mind. We all know there  are infinities in existence. We apprehend them, knowing enough about them  for all practical life purposes. You talk about the infinities known in  science, and I talk about the infinities known in religion. After all our  reasoning may it not be true that mind is infinite in its capacities? May  it not, in the future, comprehend many things which are now  incomprehensible? My increase of knowledge, consequent upon the capacities  of my mind, enables me to comprehend a great deal that I could not  comprehend a few years ago. If I could not have apprehended those things  prior to comprehending them, I never would have learned enough about them  to comprehend them. I always apprehend a thing, know it is, before I begin  to investigate it. Now, I know God, but I do not comprehend him. He is too  great in his majesty for my present knowledge. I may never comprehend him,  still I apprehend him and know enough for all practical life purposes. I  believe that I shall know a great deal more about him in the future; yes,  more even in this life, if I am only faithful in \"going on to know the  Lord.\"            MATERIALISM IN ITS BEARINGS UPON PERSON AND PERSONALITY.      Personality is individuality, existing in itself, but with a nature as its  ground.--_Coleridge._    Paley says: The seat of intellect is a person.    Lock says: Person stands for a thinking, intelligent being, that has  reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, ... which it  does only by that consciousness which is inseparable from thinking, and as  it seems to me essential to it, it being impossible for any one to  perceive without perceiving that he does perceive.    Henry Taylor says: The quality of intelligence is essential in order to  person. That which is not intelligent we call a thing, and that which is  intelligent we call a person. By the word person we therefore mean a thing  or substance that is intelligent, or a conscious being; including in the  word the idea both of the substance and its properties together.    Oldfield says: Person is a subsisting substance or \"_suppositum_,\" endued  with reason as a man is, that is capable of religion.    Thompson says: Person as, applied to Deity, expresses the definite and  certain truth that God is a living being and not a dead material energy.    Jouffroy says: Personality, in jurisprudence, denotes the capacity of  rights and obligations which belong to an intelligent will.    A person is a being who is intelligent and free. Every spiritual and moral  agent, every cause which is in possession of responsibility and  consciousness, is a person.    Webster says: Person is an individual human being consisting of body and  soul. We apply the word to living beings possessed of a rational nature;  the body when dead is not called a person.    The Biblical ground nature of the word person is in these words: \"What man  knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of man which is in him.\"    Intelligence is an essential attribute of person, but it is not a property  of matter. If intelligence is a property of matter, then the distinction  between person and thing is of a necessity a distinction without a  difference. But no greater absurdity could possess the human mind for one  moment than the thought that intelligence is a property or quality of  matter. Nothing short of the fact expressed in Bible language that the  spirit of man is a gift from God, will account for the distinction between  person and thing. Man in his physical nature is enslaved to the laws of  physical nature in common with all organized things; is subject to the  laws that control matter. The law of organic existence is such that he can  not live without a continual supply of food, which the nutritive process  continually provides in order to make up for the wastage consequent upon  disintegration of parts. But there are impassible limits fixed to the  nutritive process by the most certain of all laws, viz: those of gravity  and chemical action. To abolish these laws would insure the destruction of  all organic existence, because it would be the abrogation of the essential  conditions of organized being. Yet it is true that when a certain point is  reached a change and dissolution of the molecules always takes place, and  this change is the sure introduction of death. Hence, nothing short of  union with God, through his own appointed means, by which he brings his  own omnipotence to bear for the purpose of controlling the essential  condition of organic existence, could ever be an antidote of death. Man in  his original innocence enjoyed such means in the fruit of the tree of  life. Being removed from this he dies by the essential laws of his  existence. So man in his physical nature is enslaved in common with all  things that are under the reign of physical laws. Yet he is a free  intelligence. He is conscious of his freedom. There is in his history an  abundance of evidence to demonstrate his freedom. There is also a  sufficient amount of evidence to demonstrate the slavery of his physical  nature. But why refer to evidence here? These are facts of consciousness.  Man's personality is, in view of all that has been said, grounded upon his  mental or spiritual nature, which was always free, otherwise his identity  is lost forever in the grave. I have said, if the attributes of person are  properties of matter, there is no distinction between persons and things;  in such a case persons would be things and things would be persons. Here  it is easy to see that the materialistic philosophy upon the subject of  man's identity changes the ground nature of personality, and destroys all  distinction between persons and things.            WAS IT RIGHT?      Scientists are the last men upon the earth that should deal unfairly with  the Bible. They profess to investigate, to analyze, to demonstrate. In one  word, they profess to be in the lead of thought in a very progressive age;  therefore we expect just a little more from them than from the  unscientific. But, alas! many of them are mere socialists, and many who  are scientists have never investigated the Bible, do not understand its  facts, and are also averse to its claims.    \"Science takes account of phenomenon, and seeks to understand its law.\"  Now let us apply the test to some of the objectionable facts of the Bible,  and note the result.    Moses said to the children of Israel, Understand, therefore, this day,  that the Lord thy God is he who goeth over before thee. As a consuming  fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face;  so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them quickly, as the Lord hath  said unto thee. Deut. 9: 3. This language has reference to the inhabitants  of the land of Canaan. Their wickedness appears in the following  quotations. Deut. 12: 29, 31. When the Lord thy God shall cut off the  nations from before thee, take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by  following them, and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How  did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou shalt  not do so unto the Lord thy God: for _every abomination_ to the Lord,  which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and  their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. The destruction  of these idolators, who were burning their own sons and daughters in the  fire, furnishes unbelievers and skeptics with a great deal of capital,  which can be used with ignorance, but not with intelligence.    What was the law governing in the case? The answer is in these words: The  course of conduct which is for the greatest good of the greatest number is  right. This law is known in the science of civil government. It has its  place in the history of all civil governments. Without it we are unable to  account for the facts known in the history of our own government. It"]]]
