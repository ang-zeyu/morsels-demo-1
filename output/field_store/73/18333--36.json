Some king remarked that he would  not tell a lie for any reward less than an empire. It is not uncommon in  our world for a man to sell out all his honor and hopes for a score or a  half score of dollars.    8. PRISONS OVERFLOWING.--Our prisons are all full to overflowing of those  who took no thought of honor. They have not waited for an empire to be  offered them before they would violate the sacred rights of man, but many  of them have even murdered for a cause that would not have justified even  an exchange of words.    9. INTEGRITY THE PRIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT.--If integrity were made the pride  of the government, the love of it would soon spring up among the people. If  all fraudulent men should go straight to jail, pitilessly, and if all the  most rigid characters were sought out for all political and commercial  offices, there would soon come a popular honesty just as there has come a  love of reading or of art. It is with character as with any new  article--the difficulty lies in its first introduction.    10. A NEW VIRTUE.--May a new virtue come into favor, all our high rewards,  those from the ballot-box, those from employers, the rewards of society,  the rewards of the press, should be offered only to the worthy. A few years  of rewarding the worthy would result in a wonderful zeal in the young to  build up, not physical property, but mental and spiritual worth.    [Illustration: AN ARAB PRINCESS.]    11. BLESSING THE FAMILY GROUP.--No young man or young woman can by industry  and care reach an eminence in study or art or character, without blessing  the entire family group. We have all seen that the father and mother feel  that all life's care and labor were at last perfectly rewarded in the  success of their child. But had the child been reckless or indolent, all  this domestic joy--the joy of a large group--would have been blighted  forever.    12. AN HONORED CHILD.--There have been triumphs at old Rome, where victors  marched along with many a chariot, many an elephant, and many spoils of the  East; and in all times money has been lavished in the efforts of States to  tell their pleasure in the name of some general; but more numerous and  wide-spread and beyond expression, by chariot or cannon or drum, have been  those triumphal {20} hours, when some son or daughter has returned to the  parental hearth beautiful in the wreaths of some confessed excellence,  bearing a good name.    13. RICH CRIMINALS.--We looked at the utter wretchedness of the men who  threw away reputation, and would rather be rich criminals in exile than be  loved friends and persons at home.    14. AN EMPTY, OR AN EVIL NAME.--Young and old cannot afford to bear the  burden of an empty or an evil name. A good name is a motive of life. It is  a reason for that great encampment we call an existence. While you are  building the home of to-morrow, build up also that kind of soul that can  sleep sweetly on home's pillow, and can feel that God is not near as an  avenger of wrong, but as the Father not only of the verdure and the  seasons, but of you. Live a pure life and bear a good name, and your reward  will be sure and great.           *       *       *       *       *      {21}    The Mother's Influence.      Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you,    Many a Summer the grass has grown green,    Blossomed and faded, our faces between;    Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,    Long I to-night for your presence again.--_Elizabeth Akers Allen._      A mother is a mother still,    The holiest thing alive.--_Coleridge._                              There is none,    In all this cold and hollow world, no fount    Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within    A mother's heart.--_Mrs. Hemans._      And all my mother came into mine eyes,    And gave me up to tears.--_Shakespeare._           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: A PRAYERFUL AND DEVOTED MOTHER.]    1. HER INFLUENCE.--It is true to nature, although it be expressed in a  figurative form, that a mother is both the morning and the evening star of  life. The light of her eye is always the first to rise, and often the last  to set upon man's day of trial. She wields a power more decisive far than  syllogisms in argument or courts of last appeal in authority.    2. HER LOVE.--Mother! ecstatic sound so twined round our hearts that they  must cease to throb ere we forget it; 'tis our first love; 'tis part of  religion. Nature has set the mother upon such a pinnacle that our infant  eyes and arms are first uplifted to it; we cling to it in manhood; we  almost worship it in old age.    3. HER TENDERNESS.--Alas! how little do we appreciate a mother's tenderness  while living. How heedless are we in youth of all her anxieties and  kindness! But when she is dead and gone, when the cares and coldness of the  world come withering to our hearts, when we experience for ourselves how  hard it is to find true sympathy, how few to love us, how few will befriend  us in misfortune, then it is that we think of the mother we have lost.    4. HER CONTROLLING POWER.--The mother can take man's whole nature under her  control. She becomes what she has been called, \"The Divinity of Infancy.\"  Her smile is its sunshine, her word its mildest law, until sin and the  world have steeled the heart.    {22} 5. THE LAST TIE.--The young man who has forsaken the advice and  influence of his mother has broken the last cable and severed the last tie  that binds him to an honorable and upright life. He has forsaken his best  friend, and every hope for his future welfare may be abandoned, for he is  lost forever. If he is faithless to mother, he will have but little respect  for wife and children.    6. HOME TIES.--The young man or young woman who love their home and love  their mother can be safely trusted under almost any and all circumstances,  and their life will not be a blank, for they seek what is good. Their  hearts will be ennobled, and God will bless them.           *       *       *       *       *      {23}    Home Power.        \"The mill-streams that turn the clappers of the world arise in solitary      places.\"--HELPS.     \"Lord! with what care hast Thou begirt us round!    Parents first season us. Then schoolmasters    Deliver us to laws. They send us bound    To rules of reason.\"--GEORGE HERBERT.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: HOME AMUSEMENT.]    1. SCHOOL OF CHARACTER.--Home is the first and most important school of  character. It is there that every human being receives his best moral  training, or his worst, for it is there that he imbibes those principles of  conduct which endure through manhood, and cease only with life.    2. HOME MAKES THE MAN.--It is a common saying, \"Manners make the man;\" and  there is a second, that \"Mind makes the man;\" but truer than either is a  third, that \"Home makes the man.\" For the home-training includes not only  manners and mind, but character. It is mainly in the home that the heart is  opened, the habits are formed, the intellect is awakened, and character  moulded for good or for evil.    {24}    3. GOVERN SOCIETY.--From that source, be it pure or impure, issue the  principles and maxims that govern society. Law itself is but the reflex of  homes. The tiniest bits of opinion sown in the minds of children in private  life afterwards issue forth to the world, and become its public opinion;  for nations are gathered out of nurseries, and they who hold the  leading-strings of children may even exercise a greater power than those  who wield the reins of government.    4. THE CHILD IS FATHER OF THE MAN.--The child's character is the nucleus of  the man's; all after-education is but superposition; the form of the  crystal remains the same. Thus the saying of the poet holds true in a large  degree, \"The child is father of the man;\" or as Milton puts it, \"The  childhood shows the man, as morning shows the day.\" Those impulses to  conduct which last the longest and are rooted the deepest, always have  their origin near our birth. It is then that the germs of virtues or vices,  of feelings or sentiments, are first implanted which determine the  character of life.    5. NURSERIES.--Thus homes, which are nurseries of children who grow up into  men and women, will be good or bad according to the power that governs  them. Where the spirit of love and duty pervades the home, where head and  heart bear rule wisely there, where the daily life is honest and virtuous,  where the government is sensible, kind, and loving, then may we expect from  such a home an issue of healthy, useful, and happy beings, capable as they  gain the requisite strength, of following the footsteps of their parents,  of walking uprightly, governing themselves wisely, and contributing to the  welfare of those about them.    6. IGNORANCE, COARSENESS, AND SELFISHNESS.--On the other hand, if  surrounded by ignorance, coarseness, and selfishness, they will  unconsciously assume the same character, and grow up to adult years rude,  uncultivated, and all the more dangerous to society if placed amidst the  manifold temptations of what is called civilized life. \"Give your child to  be educated by a slave,\" said an ancient Greek, \"and, instead of one slave,  you will then have two.\"    7. MATERNAL LOVE.--Maternal love is the visible providence of our race. Its  influence is constant and universal. It begins with the education of the  human being at the outstart of life, and is prolonged by virtue of the  powerful influence which every good mother exercises over her children  through life. When launched into the world, each to take part in its  labors, anxieties, and trials, they still turn {25} to their mother for  consolation, if not for counsel, in their time of trouble and difficulty.  The pure and good thoughts she has implanted in their minds"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel! (#4)"],[1,"you?\" He greeted the great  racer. \"Now that's the sort of stuff we need! Give us another chase  across the Ohio clean up to Canada with a few like him under us. Sweep  'em clean and get going! The General wants to see the catch before  noon.\"    Drew watched the mounts being led down the lane. Beautiful, yes, but to  his mind not one of them was the equal of the gray colt he had seen at  Red Springs. Now that was a horse! And he was not tempted now to strip  his saddle off Shawnee and transfer to any one of the princes of equine  blood passing him by. He knew the roan, and Shawnee knew his job. Knows  more about the work than I do sometimes, Drew thought.    \"You, Rennie!\"    Drew swung Shawnee to the left as Quirk hailed him.    \"Take point out on the road. Just like some stubborn Yankee to try and  cut away a nice little catch like this.\"    \"Yes, sir.\" Drew merely sketched a salute; discipline was always free  and easy in the Scouts.    The day was warm. He was glad he had managed to find a lightweight shirt  back at the warehouse in town. If they didn't win Lexington to keep, at  least all of the raiders were going to ride out well-mounted, with boots  on their feet and whole clothing on their backs. The Union  quartermasters did just fine by Morgan's boys, as always.    Shawnee's ears went forward alertly, but Drew did not need that signal  of someone's approaching. He backed into the shadow-shade of a tree and  sat tense, with Colt in hand.    A horse nickered. There was the whirr of wheels. Drew edged Shawnee out  of cover and then quickly holstered his weapon, riding out to bring to a  halt the carriage horse between the shafts of an English dogcart.    He pulled off his dust-grayed hat. \"Good mornin', Aunt Marianna.\"    Such a polite greeting--the same words he would have used three years  ago had they met in the hall of Red Springs on their way to breakfast.  He wanted to laugh, or was it really laughter which lumped in his  throat?    Her momentary expression of outrage faded as she leaned forward to study  his face, and she relaxed her first half-threatening grip on her whip.  Though Aunt Marianna had never been a beauty, her present air of  assurance and authority became her, just as the smart riding habit was  better suited to her somewhat angular frame than the ruffles and bows of  the drawing room.    \"Drew!\" Her recognition of his identity had come more slowly than  Boyd's, and it sounded almost wary.    \"At your service, ma'am.\" He found himself again using the graces of  another way of life, far removed from his sweat-stained shirt and  patched breeches. He shot a glance over his shoulder, making sure they  were safely alone on that stretch of highway. After all, one horse among  so many would be no great loss to his commander. \"You'd better turn  around. The boys'll have Lady Jane out of the shaft before you get into  Lexington if you keep on. And the Yankees are still pepperin' the place  with round shot.\" He wondered why she was driving without a groom, but  did not quite dare to ask.    \"Drew, is Boyd here with you?\"    \"Boyd?\"    \"Don't be evasive with me, boy!\" She rapped that out with an officer's  snap. \"He left a note for Merry--two words misspelled and a big  blot--all foolishness about joining Morgan. Said you had been to Red  Springs, and he was going along. Why did you do it, Drew? Cousin  Merry ... after Sheldon, she can't lose Boyd, too! To put such a wild  idea into that child's head!\"    Drew's lips thinned into a half grimace. He was still cast in the role  of culprit, it seemed. \"I didn't influence Boyd to do anything, Aunt  Marianna. I told him I wouldn't take him with me, and I meant it. If he  ran away, it was his own doin'.\"    She was still measuring him with that intent look as if he were a  slightly unsatisfactory colt being put through his paces in the training  paddock.    \"Then you'll help me get him back home?\" That was more a statement than  a question, delivered in a voice which was all Mattock, enough to awaken  by the mere sound all the old resistance in him.    He nodded at the Lexington road. \"There are several thousand men ahead  there, ma'am. Hunting Boyd out if he wants to hide from me--and he  will--is impossible. He's big enough to pass a recruiter; they ain't too  particular about age these days. And he'll stay just as far from me as  he can until he is sworn in. He already knows how I feel about his  enlistin'.\"    Her gloved hands tightened on the reins. \"If I could see John Morgan  himself--\"    \"_If_ you could get to Lexington and find him--\"    \"But Boyd's just a child. He hasn't the slightest idea of war except the  stories he hears ... no idea of what could happen to him, or what this  means to Merry. All this criminal nonsense about being a soldier--sabers  and spurs, and dashing around behind a flag, the wrong flag, too--\" She  caught her breath in an unusual betrayal of emotion. And now she studied  Drew with some deliberation, noting his thinness, itemizing his  shabbiness.    He smiled tiredly. \"No, I ain't Boyd's idea of a returnin' hero, am I?\"  he agreed with her unspoken comment. \"Also, we Rebs don't use sabers;  they ain't worth much in a real skirmish.\"    She flushed. \"Drew, why did you go? Was it all because of Father? I know  he made it hard for you.\"    \"You know--\" Drew regarded a circling bird in the section of sky above  her head--\"some day I hope I'll discover just what kind of a no-account  Hunt Rennie was, to make his son so unacceptable. Most of the Texans  I've ridden with in the army haven't been so bad; some of them are  downright respectable.\"    \"I don't know.\" Again she flushed. \"It was a long time ago when it all  happened. I was just a little girl. And Father, well, he has very strong  prejudices. But, Drew, for you to go against everything you'd been  taught, to turn Rebel--that added to his bitterness. And now Boyd is  trying to go the same way. Isn't there something you can do? I can't  stand to see that look in Merry's eyes. If we can just get Boyd home  again----\"    \"Don't hope too much.\" Drew was certain that nothing Marianna Forbes  could do was going to lead Boyd Barrett back home again. On the other  hand, if the boy had not formally enlisted, perhaps the rigors of one of  the General's usual cross-country scrambles might be disillusioning.  But, having tasted the quality of Boyd's stubbornness in the past, Drew  doubted that. For long months he had been able to cut right out of his  life Red Springs and all it stood for; now it was trying to put reins on  him again. He shifted his weight in the saddle.    \"He's been restless all spring,\" his aunt continued. \"We might have  known that, given an opportunity like this, the boy would do something  wild. Only the waste, the sinful waste! I can't go back and face Merry  without trying something--anything! Can't you ... Drew?\"    \"I don't know.\" He couldn't harden himself to tell her the truth. \"I'll  try,\" he promised vaguely.    \"Drew--\" A change in tone brought his attention back to her. She looked  disturbed, almost embarrassed. \"Have you had a hard time? You look  so ... so thin and tired. Is there anything you need?\"    He flinched from any such attack on the shell he had built against the  intrusion of Red Springs, for a second or two feeling once more the rasp  across raw nerves. \"We don't get much time for sleep when the General's  on the prod. Horse stealin' and such keeps us a mite busy, accordin' to  your Yankee friends. And we have to pay our respects to them, just to  keep them reminded that this is Morgan country. I'll warn you again,  Aunt Marianna, keep Lady Jane out of Lexington today--if you want to  keep _her_.\" He gathered up his reins. \"Boyd told me about Grandfather,\"  he added in a rush. \"I'm sorry.\" And he was, he told himself, sorry for  Aunt Marianna, who had to stay at Red Springs now, and even a little in  an impersonal way for the old man, who must find inactivity a worse  prison than any stone-walled room. But it was being polite about a  stranger. \"Major Forbes ... he's all right?\"    \"Yes. Only, Drew--\" Again the urgency in her voice held him against his  will, \"Boyd....\"    He was saved further evasion by a carrying whistle from down the road,  the signal to pull in pickets. Pursing his own lips, he answered.    \"I have to go. I'll do what I can.\" He set Shawnee pounding along the  pike, and he did not look back.    If he were ever to fulfill his promise to locate Boyd, that would have  to come later. Quirk's horse catch delivered, the scouts were on the  move again, on the Georgetown road, riding at a pace which suggested  they must keep ahead of a boiling wasp's nest of Yankees. There was an  embarrassment of blue-coat prisoners on the march between two lines of  gray uniforms, and pockets of the enemy such as that at Fort Clay were  left behind. The strike northward took on a feverish drive.    Georgetown with its streets full of women and cheering males, too old or  too young to be riding with the columns. Mid-afternoon, Friday, and the  heat rising from the pavement as only June heat could. Then they reached  the Frankfort road, and the main command halted. The scouts ate in the  saddle as they fanned out along the Frankfort pike, pushing toward  Cynthiana. Sam Croxton strode back from filling his canteen at a  farmyard well and scowled at Drew, who had dismounted and loosened cinch  to cool Shawnee's back.    \"Cynthiana, now. I'm beginnin' to wonder, Rennie, if we know just which  way we are goin'.\"    Drew shrugged. \"Might be a warm reception waitin' us there. Drake  figures about five hundred Yankees on the spot, and trains comin' in  with more all the time.\"    Sighing, Croxton rubbed his hand across his freckled face, smearing road  dust and sweat into a gritty mask. \"Me--I could do with four or five  hours' sleep, right down here in the road. Always providin' no blue  belly'd trot along to stir me up. Seems like"]]]
