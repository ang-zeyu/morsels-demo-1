He  repeated his cries, ran to the door, looked back to see if any one  followed him, returned to his master's friend, pulled him by the sleeve,  and with dumb eloquence entreated him to go with him.    Struck by these actions, the company decided to follow the dog, who led  them to a tree where he began scratching the earth and howling. On  digging, the body of the unhappy man was found.    Some time after, the dog accidentally met the assassin; when instantly  seizing him by the throat, he was with great difficulty compelled to quit  his prey. As the dog continued to pursue and attack his master's murderer,  although docile to all others, his behaviour began to attract notice and  comment.    At length the affair reached the king's ear, who sent for the dog, who  appeared extremely gentle till he saw the murderer, when he ran fiercely  towards him, growling at and attacking him as usual.    The king, struck with such a collection of circumstantial evidence,  determined to refer the decision to the chance of battle; in other words,  he gave orders for a combat between the assassin and the dog. The lists  were appointed, and the man was allowed for his weapon a great cudgel.    An empty cask was given to the dog as a place of retreat, to enable him to  recover breath. The dog finding himself at liberty ran around his  adversary, avoiding his blows, and menacing him on every side, till his  strength was exhausted; then springing forward, he gripped him by the  throat, threw him on the ground, and obliged him to confess before the  king and the whole court. The assassin was afterwards convicted and  beheaded.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXIV.    The Bear and Child.      Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, had a bear called Marco, of the sagacity and  sensibility of which we have the following remarkable instance. During a  severe winter, a boy, ready to perish with cold, thought proper to enter  Marco's hut, without reflecting on the danger which he ran in exposing  himself to the mercy of the animal which occupied it. Marco, however,  instead of doing any injury to the child, took him between his paws, and  warmed him by pressing him to his breast until the next morning, when he  suffered him to depart. The boy returned in the evening to the hut, and  was received with the same affection. For several days he had no other  retreat, and it added not a little to his joy, to perceive that the bear  regularly reserved part of his food for him. A number of days passed in  this manner without the servants knowing anything of the circumstance. At  length, when one of them came one day to bring the bear his supper, rather  later than ordinary, he was astonished to see the animal roll his eyes in  a furious manner, and seeming as if he wished him to make as little noise  as possible, for fear of awaking the child, whom he clasped to his breast.  The animal, though ravenous, did not appear the least moved with the food  which was placed before him. The report of this extraordinary circumstance  was soon spread at court, and reached the ears of Leopold; who, with part  of his courtiers, was desirous of being satisfied of the truth of Marco's  generosity. Several of them passed the night near his hut, and beheld with  astonishment that the bear never stirred as long as his guest showed an  inclination to sleep. At dawn the child awoke, was very much ashamed to  find himself discovered, and, fearing that he would be punished for his  rashness, begged pardon. The bear, however, caressed him, and endeavoured  to prevail on him to eat what had been brought to him the evening before,  which he did at the request of the spectators, who conducted him to the  prince. Having learned the whole story, Leopold ordered care to be taken  of the little boy, who would doubtless have soon made his fortune, had he  not died a short time after.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXV.    The Dolphin.      In the reign of Augustus Caesar there was a dolphin in the Lucrine lake,  which formed a most romantic attachment to a poor man's son. The boy had  to go every day from Baiae to Puteoli to school, and such were the friendly  terms on which he had got with the dolphin, that he had only to wait by  the banks of the lake and cry, _Simo_, _Simo_, the name he had given to  the animal, when, lo! Simo came scudding to the shore, let fall the sharp  prickles of his skin, and gently offered his back for the boy to mount  upon. The boy, nothing afraid, used to mount instantly, when the dolphin,  without either rein or spur, would speed across the sea to Puteoli, and  after landing the young scholar, wait about the vicinity till he was  returning home, when it would again perform the same sort of civil  service. The boy was not ungrateful for such extraordinary favour, and  used every day to bring a good store of victuals for Simo, which the  animal would take from his hand in the most tame and kindly manner  imaginable. For several years this friendly intercourse was kept up; it  was, in fact, only terminated by the death of the boy; when, as the story  goes, the dolphin was so affected at seeing him return no more, that it  threw itself on the shore, and died, _as was thought_, of very grief and  sorrow!    [Illustration: 'BUT PAST BELIEF, A DOLPHIN'S ARCHED BACK PRESERVED ARION  FROM HIS DESTINED WRACK; SECURE HE SITS, AND WITH HARMONIOUS STRAINS  REQUITES THE BEARER FOR HIS FRIENDLY PAINS.']          ANECDOTE XXVI.    The Death of Antiochus Revenged.      When Antiochus was slain in battle by Centaretrius the Galatian, the  victor exultingly leaped on the back of the fallen king's horse; but he  had no sooner done so, than the animal, as if sensible that it was  bestrode by the slayer of his master, instantly exhibited signs of the  greatest fury, and bounding forwards to the top of a lofty rock, with a  speed which defied every attempt of Centaretrius to disengage himself,  leaped with him over the precipice, at the foot of which both were found  dashed to pieces.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXVII.    Mice as Navigators.      Although there are few who would dispute the cleverness and sagacity of  the larger animals, it is doubtful if there are many who credit the mouse  with even average intelligence. The following instance may go far to raise  our humble friend in the popular estimation; more especially as it has  been vouched for by eye-witnesses. In countries where berries are but  thinly dispersed, these little animals are obliged to cross rivers to make  their distant forages. In returning with their booty to their magazines,  they are obliged to recross the stream; in doing which they show an  ingenuity little short of marvellous. The party, which consists of from  six to ten, select a water-lily leaf, or some other floating substance, on  which they place the berries on a heap in the middle; then, by their  united force, bring it to the water's edge, and after launching it, embark  and place themselves round the heap, with their heads joined over it, and  their backs to the water. In this manner they drift down the stream, until  they reach the opposite shore, when they unload their cargo, which they  store away for the proverbial rainy day.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXVIII.    A Calculating Crow.      A carrion crow, perceiving a brood of fourteen chickens under the care of  the parent-hen, on a lawn, picked up one; but on a young lady opening the  window and giving an alarm, the robber dropped his prey. In the course of  the day, however, the plunderer returned, accompanied by thirteen other  crows, when every one seized his bird, and carried off the whole brood at  once.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXIX.    Porus Saved by his Elephant.      King Porus, in a battle with Alexander the Great, being severely wounded,  fell from the back of his elephant. The Macedonian soldiers, supposing him  dead, pushed forward, in order to despoil him of his rich clothing and  accoutrements; but the faithful elephant, standing over the body of its  master, boldly repelled every one who dared to approach, and while the  enemy stood at bay, took the bleeding Porus up with his trunk, and placed  him again on his back. The troops of Porus came by this time to his  relief, and the king was saved; but the elephant died of the wounds which  it had received in the heroic defence of its master.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXX.    Drawing Water.      Some years ago, an ass was employed at Carisbrook Castle, in the Isle of  Wight, in drawing water by a large wheel from a very deep well, supposed  to have been sunk by the Romans. When the keeper wanted water, he would  say to the ass, \"Tom, my boy, I want water; get into the wheel, my good  lad;\" which Thomas immediately performed with an alacrity and sagacity  that would have done credit to a nobler animal; and no doubt he knew the  precise number of times necessary for the wheel to revolve upon its axis,  to complete his labour, because every time he brought the bucket to the  surface of the well, he constantly stopped and turned round his honest  head to observe the moment when his master laid hold of the bucket to draw  it towards him, because he had then a nice evolution to make, either to  recede or to advance a little. It was pleasing to observe with what  steadiness and regularity the poor animal performed his labour.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXI.    The Broken Heart.      During the French Revolution M. des R----, an ancient magistrate and most  estimable man, was condemned to death on the charge of conspiracy and  thrown into prison. M. des R---- had a water spaniel, which had been  brought up by him, and had never quitted him. Refused admission to the  prison, he returned to his master's house, and found it shut; he took  refuge with a neighbour.

Do not think with yourselves, that I know not how  much it is increased with you, within these six-score years: I know it  well: and yet I say greater then than now; whether it was, that the  example of the ark, that saved the remnant of men from the universal  deluge, gave men confidence to adventure upon the waters; or what it  was; but such is the truth.  The Phoenicians, and especially the  Tyrians, had great fleets.  So had the Carthaginians their colony,  which is yet further west.  Toward the east the shipping of Egypt and  of Palestine was likewise great.  China also, and the great Atlantis,  (that you call America,) which have now but junks and canoes, abounded  then in tall ships.  This island, (as appeareth by faithful registers  of those times,) had then fifteen hundred strong ships, of great  content.  Of all this, there is with you sparing memory, or none; but  we have large knowledge thereof.    \"At that time, this land was known and frequented by the ships and  vessels of all the nations before named.  And (as it cometh to pass)  they had many times men of other countries, that were no sailors, that  came with them; as Persians, Chaldeans, Arabians; so as almost all  nations of might and fame resorted hither; of whom we have some stirps,  and little tribes with us at this day.  And for our own ships, they  went sundry voyages, as well to your straits, which you call the  Pillars of Hercules, as to other parts in the Atlantic and Mediterrane  Seas; as to Paguin, (which is the same with Cambaline,) and Quinzy,  upon the Oriental Seas, as far as to the borders of the East Tartary.    \"At the same time, and an age after, or more, the inhabitants of the  great Atlantis did flourish.  For though the narration and description,  which is made by a great man with you; that the descendants of Neptune  planted there; and of the magnificent temple, palace, city, and hill;  and the manifold streams of goodly navigable rivers, (which as so many  chains environed the same site and temple); and the several degrees of  ascent, whereby men did climb up to the same, as if it had been a scala  coeli, be all poetical and fabulous: yet so much is true, that the said  country of Atlantis, as well that of Peru, then called Coya, as that of  Mexico, then named Tyrambel, were mighty and proud kingdoms in arms,  shipping and riches: so mighty, as at one time (or at least within the  space of ten years) they both made two great expeditions; they of  Tyrambel through the Atlantic to the Mediterrane Sea; and they of Coya  through the South Sea upon this our island: and for the former of  these, which was into Europe, the same author amongst you (as it  seemeth) had some relation from the Egyptian priest whom he cited.  For  assuredly such a thing there was.  But whether it were the ancient  Athenians that had the glory of the repulse and resistance of those  forces, I can say nothing: but certain it is, there never came back  either ship or man from that voyage.  Neither had the other voyage of  those of Coya upon us had better fortune, if they had not met with  enemies of greater clemency.  For the king of this island, (by name  Altabin,) a wise man and a great warrior, knowing well both his own  strength and that of his enemies, handled the matter so, as he cut off  their land-forces from their ships; and entoiled both their navy and  their tamp with a greater power than theirs, both by sea and land: arid  compelled them to render themselves without striking stroke and after  they were at his mercy, contenting himself only with their oath that  they should no more bear arms against him, dismissed them all in safety.    \"But the divine revenge overtook not long after those proud  enterprises.  For within less than the space of one hundred years, the  great Atlantis was utterly lost and destroyed: not by a great  earthquake, as your man saith; (for that whole tract is little subject  to earthquakes;) but by a particular' deluge or inundation; those  countries having, at this day, far greater rivers and far higher  mountains to pour down waters, than any part of the old world.  But it  is true that the same inundation was not deep; not past forty foot, in  most places, from the ground; so that although it destroyed man and  beast generally, yet some few wild inhabitants of the wood escaped.  Birds also were saved by flying to the high trees and woods.  For as  for men, although they had buildings in many places, higher than the  depth of the water, yet that inundation, though it were shallow, had a  long continuance; whereby they of the vale that were not drowned,  perished for want of food and other things necessary.    \"So as marvel you not at the thin population of America, nor at the  rudeness and ignorance of the people; for you must account your  inhabitants of America as a young people; younger a thousand years, at  the least, than the rest of the world: for that there was so much time  between the universal flood and their particular inundation.  For the  poor remnant of human seed, which remained in their mountains, peopled  the country again slowly, by little and little; and being simple and  savage people, (not like Noah and his sons, which was the chief family  of the earth;) they were not able to leave letters, arts, and civility  to their posterity; and having likewise in their mountainous  habitations been used (in respect of the extreme cold of those regions)  to clothe themselves with the skins of tigers, bears, and great hairy  goats, that they have in those parts; when after they came down into  the valley, and found the intolerable heats which are there, and knew  no means of lighter apparel, they were forced to begin the custom of  going naked, which continueth at this day.  Only they take great pride  and delight in the feathers of birds; and this also they took from  those their ancestors of the mountains, who were invited unto it by the  infinite flights of birds that came up to the high grounds, while the  waters stood below.  So you see, by this main accident of time, we lost  our traffic with the Americans, with whom of, all others, in regard  they lay nearest to us, we had most commerce.    \"As for the other parts of the world, it is most manifest that in the  ages following (whether it were in respect of wars, or by a natural  revolution of time,) navigation did every where greatly decay; and  specially far voyages (the rather by the use of galleys, and such  vessels as could hardly brook the ocean,) were altogether left and  omitted.  So then, that part of intercourse which could be from other  nations to sail to us, you see how it hath long since ceased; except it  were by some rare accident, as this of yours.  But now of the cessation  of that other part of intercourse, which might be by our sailing to  other nations, I must yield you some other cause.  For I cannot say (if  I shall say truly,) but our shipping, for number, strength, mariners,  pilots, and all things that appertain to navigation, is as great as  ever; and therefore why we should sit at home, I shall now give you an  account by itself: and it will draw nearer to give you satisfaction to  your principal question.    \"There reigned in this land, about nineteen hundred years ago, a king,  whose memory of all others we most adore; not superstitiously, but as a  divine instrument, though a mortal man; his name was Solamona: and we  esteem him as the lawgiver of our nation.  This king had a large heart,  inscrutable for good; and was wholly bent to make his kingdom and  people happy.  He therefore, taking into consideration how sufficient  and substantive this land was to maintain itself without any aid (at  all) of the foreigner; being five thousand six hundred miles in  circuit, and of rare fertility of soil in the greatest part thereof;  and finding also the shipping of this country might be plentifully set  on work, both by fishing and by transportations from port to port, and  likewise by sailing unto some small islands that are not far from us,  and are under the crown and laws of this state; and, recalling into his  memory the happy and flourishing estate wherein this land then was; so  as it might be a thousand ways altered to the worse, but scarce any one  way to the better; thought nothing wanted to his noble and heroical  intentions, but only (as far as human foresight might reach) to give  perpetuity to that which was in his time so happily established.  Therefore amongst his other fundamental laws of this kingdom, he did  ordain the interdicts and prohibitions which we have touching entrance  of strangers; which at that time (though it was after the calamity of  America) was frequent; doubting novelties, and commixture of manners.  It is true, the like law against the admission of strangers without  licence is an ancient law in the kingdom of China, and yet continued in  use.  But there it is a poor thing; and hath made them a curious,  ignorant, fearful, foolish nation.  But our lawgiver made his law of  another temper.  For first, he hath preserved all points of humanity,  in taking order and making provision for the relief of strangers  distressed; whereof you have tasted.\"    At which speech (as reason was) we all rose up and bowed ourselves. He  went on.    \"That king also, still desiring to join humanity and policy together;  and thinking it against humanity, to detain strangers here against  their wills, and against policy that they should return and discover  their knowledge of this estate, he took this course: he did ordain that  of the strangers that should be permitted to land, as many (at all  times) might depart as would; but as many as would stay should have  very good conditions and means to live from the state.  Wherein he saw  so far, that now in so many ages since the prohibition, we have memory  not of one ship that ever returned, and but of thirteen persons only,  at several times, that chose to "]]]
