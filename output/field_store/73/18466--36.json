The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout  the entry:       acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish  and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid  rain).       acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly  to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH  scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered  alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note  - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in  New England.       aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas,  smoke, or fog.       afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by  planting trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on  areas that have been cut or destroyed by fire.       asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly  used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic  in particulate form.       biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.       bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence,  abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.       biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given  area or volume.       carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon  (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere,  ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.       catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited  freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.       DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was  banned in the US in 1972.       defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.       deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,  and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without  planting new growth.       desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or  semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive  soils, or climate change.       dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,  shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.       drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is  generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often  results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-  commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the  ocean clean.\"       ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of  organisms and their specific environments.       effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial  waste which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting  it.       endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.       freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.       greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the  lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary  greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.       groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth  often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the  source for wells and natural springs.       Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly  and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it  forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders  economic resources.       Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 145,000 Inuits  of Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental  issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the  focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of  pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.       metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.       noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.       overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than  it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.       ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.       poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern  with respect to endangered or threatened species.       pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.       potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.       salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water  becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse  process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by  evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.       siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become  clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil  erosion.       slash-and-burn "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#4)"],[1,"disease in the family.  They gave up all hope of recovery. Indeed, his state grew worse and  worse; he felt an unconquerable aversion for every kind of food, and the  vomiting was incessant. The last three days of his life he complained  that a fire was burning in his breast, and the flames that burned within  seemed to blaze forth at his eyes, the only part of his body that  appeared to live, so like a corpse was all the rest of him. On the 17th  of June 1670 he died: the poison had taken seventy-two days to complete  its work. Suspicion began to dawn: the lieutenant's body was opened, and  a formal report was drawn up. The operation was performed in the  presence of the surgeons Dupre and Durant, and Gavart, the apothecary,  by M. Bachot, the brothers' private physician. They found the stomach  and duodenum to be black and falling to pieces, the liver burnt and  gangrened. They said that this state of things must have been produced  by poison, but as the presence of certain bodily humours sometimes  produces similar appearances, they durst not declare that the  lieutenant's death could not have come about by natural causes, and he  was buried without further inquiry.    It was as his private physician that Dr. Bachot had asked for the  autopsy of his patient's brother. For the younger brother seemed to have  been attacked by the same complaint, and the doctor hoped to find from  the death of the one some means for preserving the life of the other.  The councillor was in a violent fever, agitated unceasingly both in body  and mind: he could not bear any position of any kind for more than a few  minutes at a time. Bed was a place of torture; but if he got up, he  cried for it again, at least for a change of suffering. At the end of  three months he died. His stomach, duodenum, and liver were all in the  same corrupt state as his brother's, and more than that, the surface of  his body was burnt away. This, said the doctors; was no dubious sign of  poisoning; although, they added, it sometimes happened that a  'cacochyme' produced the same effect. Lachaussee was so far from being  suspected, that the councillor, in recognition of the care he had  bestowed on him in his last illness, left him in his will a legacy of a  hundred crowns; moreover, he received a thousand francs from  Sainte-Croix and the marquise.    So great a disaster in one family, however, was not only sad but  alarming. Death knows no hatred: death is deaf and blind, nothing more,  and astonishment was felt at this ruthless destruction of all who bore  one name. Still nobody suspected the true culprits, search was  fruitless, inquiries led nowhere: the marquise put on mourning for her  brothers, Sainte-Croix continued in his path of folly, and all things  went on as before. Meanwhile Sainte-Croix had made the acquaintance of  the Sieur de Saint Laurent, the same man from whom Penautier had asked  for a post without success, and had made friends with him. Penautier had  meanwhile become the heir of his father-in-law, the Sieur Lesecq, whose  death had most unexpectedly occurred; he had thereby gained a second  post in Languedoc and an immense property: still, he coveted the place  of receiver of the clergy. Chance now once more helped him: a few days  after taking over from Sainte-Croix a man-servant named George, M. de  Saint-Laurent fell sick, and his illness showed symptoms similar to  those observed in the case of the d'Aubrays, father and sons; but it was  more rapid, lasting only twenty-four hours. Like them, M. de  Saint-Laurent died a prey to frightful tortures. The same day an officer  from the sovereign's court came to see him, heard every detail connected  with his friend's death, and when told of the symptoms said before the  servants to Sainfray the notary that it would be necessary to examine  the body. An hour later George disappeared, saying nothing to anybody,  and not even asking for his wages. Suspicions were excited; but again  they remained vague. The autopsy showed a state of things not precisely  to be called peculiar to poisoning cases the intestines, which the fatal  poison had not had time to burn as in the case of the d'Aubrays, were  marked with reddish spots like flea-bites. In June Penautier obtained  the post that had been held by the Sieur de Saint-Laurent.    But the widow had certain suspicions which were changed into something  like certainty by George's flight. A particular circumstance aided and  almost confirmed her doubts. An abbe who was a friend of her husband,  and knew all about the disappearance of George, met him some days  afterwards in the rue des Masons, near the Sorbonne. They were both on  the same side, and a hay-cart coming along the street was causing a  block. George raised his head and saw the abbe, knew him as a friend of  his late master, stooped under the cart and crawled to the other side,  thus at the risk of being crushed escaping from the eyes of a man whose  appearance recalled his crime and inspired him with fear of punishment.  Madame de Saint-Laurent preferred a charge against George, but though he  was sought for everywhere, he could never be found. Still the report of  these strange deaths, so sudden and so incomprehensible, was bruited  about Paris, and people began to feel frightened. Sainte-Croix, always  in the gay world, encountered the talk in drawing-rooms, and began to  feel a little uneasy. True, no suspicion pointed as yet in his  direction; but it was as well to take precautions, and Sainte-Croix  began to consider how he could be freed from anxiety. There was a post  in the king's service soon to be vacant, which would cost 100,000  crowns; and although Sainte-Croix had no apparent means, it was rumoured  that he was about to purchase it. He first addressed himself to  Belleguise to treat about this affair with Penautier. There was some  difficulty, however, to be encountered in this quarter. The sum was a  large one, and Penautier no longer required help; he had already come  into all the inheritance he looked for, and so he tried to throw cold  water on the project.    Sainte-Croix thus wrote to Belleguise:    \"DEAR FRIEND,--Is it possible that you need any more talking to about  the matter you know of, so important as it is, and, maybe, able to give  us peace and quiet for the rest of our days! I really think the devil  must be in it, or else you simply will not be sensible: do show your  common sense, my good man, and look at it from all points of view; take  it at its very worst, and you still ought to feel bound to serve me,  seeing how I have made everything all right for you: all our interests  are together in this matter. Do help me, I beg of you; you may feel sure  I shall be deeply grateful, and you will never before have acted so  agreeably both for me and for yourself. You know quite enough about it,  for I have not spoken so openly even to my own brother as I have to you.  If you can come this afternoon, I shall be either at the house or quite  near at hand, you know where I mean, or I will expect you tomorrow  morning, or I will come and find you, according to what you  reply.--Always yours with all my heart.\"    The house meant by Sainte-Croix was in the rue des Bernardins, and the  place near at hand where he was to wait for Belleguise was the room he  leased from the widow Brunet, in the blind alley out of the Place  Maubert. It was in this room and at the apothecary Glazer's that  Sainte-Croix made his experiments; but in accordance with poetical  justice, the manipulation of the poisons proved fatal to the workers  themselves. The apothecary fell ill and died; Martin was attacked by  fearful sickness, which brought, him to death's door. Sainte-Croix was  unwell, and could not even go out, though he did not know what was the  matter. He had a furnace brought round to his house from Glazer's, and  ill as he was, went on with the experiments. Sainte-Croix was then  seeking to make a poison so subtle that the very effluvia might be  fatal. He had heard of the poisoned napkin given to the young dauphin,  elder brother of Charles VII, to wipe his hands on during a game of  tennis, and knew that the contact had caused his death; and the still  discussed tradition had informed him of the gloves of Jeanne d'Albret;  the secret was lost, but Sainte-Croix hoped to recover it. And then  there happened one of those strange accidents which seem to be not the  hand of chance but a punishment from Heaven. At the very moment when  Sainte-Croix was bending over his furnace, watching the fatal  preparation as it became hotter and hotter, the glass mask which he wore  over his face as a protection from any poisonous exhalations that might  rise up from the mixture, suddenly dropped off, and Sainte-Croix dropped  to the ground as though felled by a lightning stroke. At supper-time,  his wife finding that he did not come out from his closet where he was  shut in, knocked at the door, and received no answer; knowing that her  husband was wont to busy himself with dark and mysterious matters, she  feared some disaster had occurred. She called her servants, who broke in  the door. Then she found Sainte-Croix stretched out beside the furnace,  the broken glass lying by his side. It was impossible to deceive the  public as to the circumstances of this strange and sudden death: the  servants had seen the corpse, and they talked. The commissary Picard was  ordered to affix the seals, and all the widow could do was to remove the  furnace and the fragments of the glass mask.    The noise of the event soon spread all over Paris. Sainte-Croix was  extremely well known, and the, news that he was about to purchase a post  in the court had made him known even more widely. Lachaussee was one of  the first to learn of his master's death; and hearing that a seal had  been set upon his room, he hastened to put in an objection in these  terms:    \"Objection of Lachaussee, who"]]]
