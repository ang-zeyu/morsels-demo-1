[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28287"],[0,"The Lady of the Lake (#4)"],[1,"as _Waverley_ in the spring of 1814--an event \"memorable  in the annals of British literature; in the annals of British  bookselling thrice and four times memorable.\" The popularity of the  metrical romances dwindled to insignificance before the enthusiasm with  which this prose romance was received. A moment before quietly resolved  to give up his place in the world's eye, and to live the life of an  obscure country gentleman, Scott found himself launched once more on the  tide of brave fortunes. The Ballantyne publishing and printing houses  ceased to totter, and settled themselves on what seemed the firmest of  foundations. At Abbotsford, buying, planting, and building began on a  greater scale than had ever been planned in its owner's most sanguine  moments.    The history of the next eleven years in Scott's life is the history, on  the one hand, of the rapidly-appearing novels, of a fame gradually  spreading outward from Great Britain until it covered the civilized  world--a fame increased rather than diminished by the _incognito_ which  the \"author of _Waverley_\" took great pains to preserve even after the  secret had become an open one; on the other hand, of the large-hearted,  hospitable life at Abbotsford, where, in spite of the importunities of  curious and ill-bred tourists, bent on getting a glimpse of the \"Wizard  of the North,\" and in spite of the enormous mass of work, literary and  official, which Scott took upon himself to perform, the atmosphere of  country leisure and merriment was somehow miraculously preserved. This  life of the hearty prosperous country laird was the one toward the  realization of which all Scott's efforts were directed; it is worth  while, therefore, to see as vividly as may be, what kind of life that  was, that we may the better understand what kind of man he was who cared  for it. The following extract from Lockhart's _Life of Scott_ gives us  at least one very characteristic aspect of the Abbotsford world:         \"It was a clear, bright September morning, with a sharpness in the       air that doubled the animating influence of the sunshine; and all       was in readiness for a grand coursing-match on Newark Hill. The       only guest who had chalked out other sport for himself was the       staunchest of anglers, Mr. Rose; but he, too, was there on his       _shelty_, armed with his salmon-rod and landing-net.... This little       group of Waltonians, bound for Lord Somerville's preserve, remained       lounging about, to witness the start of the main cavalcade. Sir       Walter, mounted on Sibyl, was marshalling the order of procession       with a huge hunting-whip; and among a dozen frolicsome youths and       maidens, who seemed disposed to laugh at all discipline, appeared,       each on horseback, each as eager as the youngest sportsman in the       troop, Sir Humphrey Davy, Dr. Wollaston, and the patriarch of       Scottish belles-lettres, Henry Mackenzie.... Laidlow (the steward       of Abbotsford) on a strong-tailed wiry Highlander, yclept Hoddin       Grey, which carried him nimbly and stoutly, although his feet       almost touched the ground, was the adjutant. But the most       picturesque figure was the illustrious inventor of the safety-lamp       (Sir Humphrey Davy) ... a brown hat with flexible brim, surrounded       with line upon line of catgut, and innumerable fly-hooks; jackboots       worthy of a Dutch smuggler, and a fustian surtout dabbled with the       blood of salmon, made a fine contrast with the smart jacket,       white-cord breeches, and well-polished jockey-boots of the less       distinguished cavaliers about him. Dr. Wollaston was in black; and       with his noble serene dignity of countenance might have passed for       a sporting archbishop. Mr. Mackenzie, at this time in the       seventy-sixth year of his age, with a hat turned up with green,       green spectacles, green jacket, and long brown leathern gaiters       buttoned upon his nether anatomy, wore a dog-whistle round his       neck.... Tom Purdie (one of Scott's servants) and his subalterns       had preceded us by a few hours with all the grey-hounds that could       be collected at Abbotsford, Darnick, and Melrose; but the giant       Maida had remained as his master's orderly, and now gamboled about       Sibyl Grey barking for mere joy like a spaniel puppy.         \"The order of march had all been settled, when Scott's daughter       Anne broke from the line, screaming with laughter, and exclaimed,       'Papa, papa, I knew you could never think of going without your       pet!' Scott looked round, and I rather think there was a blush as       well as a smile upon his face, when he perceived a little black pig       frisking about his pony, evidently a self-elected addition to the       party of the day. He tried to look stern, and cracked his whip at       the creature, but was in a moment obliged to join in the general       cheers. Poor piggy soon found a strap round its neck, and was       dragged into the background; Scott, watching the retreat, repeated       with mock pathos, the first verse of an old pastoral song--           What will I do gin my hoggie die?         My joy, my pride, my hoggie!         My only beast, I had na mae,         And wow, but I was vogie!         --the cheers were redoubled--and the squadron moved on.\"    Let us supplement this with one more picture, from the same hand,  showing Scott in a little more intimate light. The passage was written  in 1821, after Lockhart had married Scott's eldest daughter, and gone  to spend the summer at Chiefswood, a cottage on the Abbotsford estate:         \"We were near enough Abbotsford to partake as often as we liked of       its brilliant and constantly varying society; yet could do so       without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit which       the daily reception of new-comers entailed upon all the family,       except Scott himself. But in truth, even he was not always proof       against the annoyances connected with such a style of open       house-keeping.... When sore beset at home in this way, he would       every now and then discover that he had some very particular       business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate, and       craving the indulgence of his guests overnight, appear at the cabin       in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the morning. The       clatter of Sibyl Grey's hoofs, the yelping of Mustard and Spice,       and his own joyous shout of _reveillee_ under our windows, were the       signal that he had burst his toils, and meant for that day to 'take       his ease in his inn.' On descending, he was found to be seated with       all his dogs and ours about him, under a spreading ash that       overshadowed half the bank between the cottage and the brook,       pointing the edge of his woodman's axe, and listening to Tom       Purdie's lecture touching the plantation that most needed thinning.       After breakfast he would take possession of a dressing-room       upstairs, and write a chapter of _The Pirate_; and then, having       made up and despatched his packet for Mr. Ballantyne, away to join       Purdie wherever the foresters were at work ... until it was time to       rejoin his own party at Abbotsford or the quiet circle of the       cottage. When his guests were few and friendly, he often made them       come over and meet him at Chiefswood in a body towards evening....       He was ready with all sorts of devices to supply the wants of a       narrow establishment; he used to delight particularly in sinking       the wine in a well under the _brae_ ere he went out, and hauling up       the basket just before dinner was announced,--this primitive device       being, he said, what he had always practised when a young       housekeeper, and in his opinion far superior in its results to any       application of ice; and in the same spirit, whenever the weather       was sufficiently genial, he voted for dining out of doors       altogether.\"    Few events of importance except the successive appearances of \"our  buiks\" as Tom Purdie called his master's novels, and an occasional visit  to London or the continent, intervened to break the busy monotony of  this Abbotsford life. On one of these visits to London, Scott was  invited to dine with the Prince Regent, and when the prince became King  George IV, in 1820, almost the first act of his reign was to create  Scott a baronet. Scott accepted the honor gratefully, as coming, he  said, \"from the original source of all honor.\" There can well be two  opinions as to whether this least admirable of English kings constituted  a very prime fountain of honor, judged by democratic standards; but to  Scott's mind, such an imputation would have been next to sacrilege. The  feudal bias of his mind, strong to start with, had been strengthened by  his long sojourn among the visions of a feudal past; the ideals of  feudalism were living realities to him; and he accepted knighthood from  his king's hand in exactly the same spirit which determined his attitude  of humility towards his \"chief,\" the Duke of Buccleugh, and which  impelled him to exhaust his genius in the effort to build up a great  family estate.    There were already signs that the enormous burden of work under which he  seemed to move so lightly, was telling on him. _The Bride of  Lammermoor_, _The Legend of Montrose_, and _Ivanhoe_, had all of them  been dictated between screams of pain, wrung from his lips by a chronic  cramp of the stomach. By the time he reached _Redgauntlet_ and _St.  Ronan's Well_, there began to be heard faint murmurings of discontent  from his public, hints that he was writing too fast, and that the noble  wine he had poured them for so long was growing at last a trifle watery.  To add to these causes of uneasiness, the commercial ventures in which  he was interested drifted again into a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28297"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, May, 1880 (#4)"],[1,"far as it is known in all its general laws and in all its  parts, we proceed from these prefatory considerations to other matters  still more intimately introductory to our design.    It is essentially preliminary to a clear and forcible display of the  reasonableness and certainty of our faith in Jesus Christ as the author of  immortality to man, that we ascertain the proper ground on which the  modern skeptic, of whatever creed, stands when he avows his opposition to  the gospel. That we may duly estimate the strength of his opposition, we  must not only enumerate his objections or arguments, but we must exactly  ascertain the exact position which he occupies. Does he stand within a  fortified castle, or in the open field? Presents he himself to our view in  a stronghold, well garrisoned with the invincible forces of logic, of  science, and of fact? or defies he armies and the artillery of light,  relying wholly upon himself, his own experience, without a shield, without  an ally, without science, without history, and consequently a single fact  to oppose?    That we may, then, truly and certainly ascertain his precise attitude,  before we directly address him, we shall accurately survey his whole  premises. Does he say that he _knows_ the gospel to be false? No, he can  not; for he was not in Judea in the days of the evangelical drama. He,  therefore, could not test the miracles, or sensible demonstrations, by any  of his senses; nor prove to himself that Jesus rose not from the dead.  Speaking in accordance with the evidence of sense, of consciousness, and  of experience, he can not say that he _knows_ the gospel to be a cunningly  devised fable. He has not, then, in all his premises _knowledge_, in its  true and proper meaning, to oppose to the Christian's faith or hope. What  remains?    Can he say, in truth, that he _believes_ the gospel to be false? He can  not; because belief without testimony is impossible; and testimony that  the gospel facts did not occur is not found extant on earth in any  language or nation under heaven. No contemporaneous opposing testimony has  ever been heard of, except in one instance, the sleeping and incredible  testimony of the Roman guard, which has a lie stamped indelibly on its  forehead: \"His disciples stole his dead body while we were asleep.\" He  that can believe this is not to be reasoned with. We repeat it with  emphasis, that no living man can say, according to the English Dictionary,  that he _believes_ the gospel to be false.    Alike destitute of knowledge and of faith to oppose to the testimony of  apostles, prophets, and myriads of contemporaneous witnesses, what has the  skeptic to present against the numerous and diversified evidences of the  gospel? Nothing in the universe but his _doubts_. He can, in strict  conformity to language and fact, only say, he doubts whether it be true.  He is, then, legitimately no more than an inmate of Doubting Castle. His  fortification is built up of doubts and misgivings, cemented by antipathy.  Farther than this the powers of nature and of reason can not go.    How far these doubts are rational, scientific, and modest, may yet appear  in the sequel; meanwhile, we only survey the premises which the infidel  occupies, and the forces he has to bring into the action. These, may we  not say, are already logically ascertained to be an army of doubts only.    Some talk of the immodesty, others of the folly, others of the  maliciousness of the unbeliever; but not to deal in harsh or uncourteous  epithets, may we not say, that it is most unphilosophic to dogmatize  against the gospel on the slender grounds of sheer dubiety. No man,  deserving the name of a _philosopher_, can ever appear among the crusading  forces of pamphleteers and declaimers against the faith of Christians, for  two of the best reasons in the world; he has nothing better to substitute  for the motives, the restraining fears to the wicked, and the animating  hopes to the righteous, which the gospel tenders; and he has nothing to  oppose to its claims but the weakness and uncertainty of his doubts.  Franklin was a philosopher, but Paine was a madman. The former doubted,  but never dogmatized--never opposed the gospel, but always discountenanced  and discouraged the infidel; the latter gave to his doubts the authority  of oracles, and madly attempted to silence the Christian's artillery by  the licentious scoffings of the most extravagant and unreasonable  skepticism.    Modesty is the legitimate daughter of true philosophy; but dogmatism,  unless the offspring of infallible authority, is the ill-bred child of  ignorance and arrogance. Every man, then, who seeks to make proselytes to  his skepticism by converting his doubts into arguments, is anything but a  philosopher or a philanthropist.    One of the most alarming signs of this age is the ignorance and  recklessness of the youthful assailants of the Bible. Our cities, villages  and public places of resort are thronged with swarms of these Lilliputian  volunteers in the cause of skepticism. Apprenticed striplings, and sprigs  of law and physic, whose whole reading of standard authors on general  science, religion, or morality, in ordinary duodecimo, equals not the  years of their unfinished, or just completed minority, imagine that they  have got far in advance of the vulgar herd, and are both philosophers and  gentlemen if they have learned at second hand, a few scoffs and sneers at  the Bible, from Paine, Voltaire, Bolingbroke, or Hume. One would think,  could he listen to their impudence, that Bacon, Newton, Locke, and all the  great masters of science, were very pigmies, and that they themselves were  sturdy giants of extraordinary stature in all that is intellectual,  philosophic and learned. These would-be baby demagogues are a public  nuisance to society, whose atheistic breath not unfrequently pollutes the  whole atmosphere around them, and issues in a moral pestilence among that  class who regard a fine hat and a cigar as the infallible criteria of a  gentleman and scholar.    These creatures have not sense enough to doubt, nor to think sedately on  any subject; and therefore, we only notice them while defining the ground  occupied by the unbelievers of this generation. They prudently call  themselves skeptics, but imprudently carry their opposition to the Bible,  beyond all the bounds embraced in their own definitions of skepticism. A  skeptic can only _doubt_, never _oppugn_ the gospel. He becomes an  atheist, or an infidel, bold and dogmatic, as soon as he opens his mouth  against the Bible.    Were we philosophically to class society as it now exists in this country  in reference to the gospel, we should have believers, unbelievers, and  skeptics. We would find some who have voluntarily received the apostolic  testimony as true; others who have rejected it as false; and a third class  who simply doubt, and neither receive nor reject it as a communication  from heaven. But, though, unbelievers, while they call themselves  skeptics, often wage actual war against the faith and hope of Christians,  still their actual rejection of the gospel has no other foundation than  pure aversion to its restraints and some doubts as to its authenticity.  The quagmire of their own doubts, be it distinctly remembered, is the sole  ground occupied by all the opponents of the gospel, whether they style  themselves antitheists, atheists, theists, unbelievers, or  skeptics.--_Alexander Campbell, in 1835._            INFIDELITY, AND THE FRENCH AND AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS IN THEIR RELATIONS TO  THOMAS PAINE.      Infidels can not free themselves from the bands which tie the universe to  its God. Every effort has been fruitless. Not one writer among all their  hosts has been lucky enough to avoid the use of Christian terms that are  in direct antagonism with their speculation and positions. It will be  interesting to review, occasionally, their literature.    Speaking of Thomas Paine, Mr. Ingersoll says: \"Every American with the  DIVINE mantle of charity, should cover all his faults.\" What use has Col.  Ingersoll or any other infidel for the word DIVINE? The term is thus  defined: Pertaining to the true God; (from the Latin DIVINUS; from DEUS, a  god) proceeding from God; appropriated to God; or celebrating His praise;  excellent in the supreme degree; apparently above what is human; godlike;  heavenly; holy; sacred; spiritual. As a noun: one versed in divine things  or divinity; a theologian; a minister of the gospel; a priest; a  clergyman. _Zell's Encyclopedia._    Again, Mr. Ingersoll says, \"Upon the head of his father, GOD had never  poured the DIVINE petroleum of _authority_.\" So much the better for the  race. What would infidels do if they had the authority? \"Hume is called a  model man, a man as nearly perfect as the nature of human frailty will  permit.\" He maintained that pleasure or profit is the test of morals; that  \"the lack of honesty is of a piece with the lack of strength of body;\"  that \"suicide is lawful and commendable;\" that \"female infidelity, when  known, is a small thing; when unknown, nothing;\" \"that adultery must be  practiced if men would obtain all the advantages of this life; and that if  generally practiced it would, in time, cease to be scandalous, and if  practiced frequently and secretly would come to be thought no crime at  all.\"    Lord Herbert taught that the \"indulgence of lust and anger is no more to  be blamed than thirst or drowsiness.\"    Voltaire contended \"for the unlimited gratification of the sexual  appetites, and was a sensualist of the lowest type; nevertheless he had  the amazing good sense to wish that he had never been born.\"    Rousseau was, by his confession, a habitual liar and thief, and debauchee;  a man so utterly vile that he took advantage of the hospitality of friends  to plot their domestic ruin; a man so destitute of natural affection that  he committed his"]]]
