It is useful in \"applique\" from the many beautiful  tones of colour it takes. As a ground for silk or gold embroidery it  is also very good.      [Decoration]    TEXTILE FABRICS.    GOLD AND SILVER CLOTH.    _Cloth of Gold or Silver_ is made of threads of silk woven with metal,  which is thrown to the surface. In its best form it is extremely  expensive, varying from L4 to L6 per yard, according to the weight of  gold introduced. Cloth of silver is generally L3 the yard.           *       *       *       *       *    Inferior kinds of these cloths are made in which silk largely  predominates, and shows plainly on the surface. They are frequently  woven in patterns, such as diaper or diagonal lines, with a tie of red  silk, in imitation of the diaper patterns of couched embroidery.    They are chiefly used in ecclesiastical or heraldic embroidery; their  great expense preventing their general use.          [Decoration]    CHAPTER III.    STITCHES USED IN HAND EMBROIDERY AS TAUGHT AT THE ROYAL SCHOOL OF  ART-NEEDLEWORK.      To avoid pulling or puckering the work, care should be taken--firstly,  that the needle is not too small, so as to require any force in  drawing it through the material; secondly, the material must be held  in a convex position over the fingers, so that the crewel or silk in  the needle shall be looser than the ground; and thirdly, not to use  too long needlefuls. These rules apply generally to all handworked  embroideries.      STITCHES.    _Stem Stitch._--The first stitch which is taught to a beginner is  \"stem stitch\" (wrongly called also, \"crewel stitch,\" as it has no  claim to being used exclusively in crewel embroidery). It is most  useful in work done in the hand, and especially in outlines of  flowers, unshaded leaves, and arabesque, and all conventional designs.    [Illustration: No. 1.--STEM STITCH.]    It may be best described as a long stitch forward on the surface, and  a shorter one backward on the under side of the fabric, the stitches  following each other almost in line from left to right. The effect on  the wrong side is exactly that of an irregular back-stitching used by  dressmakers, as distinguished from regular stitching. A leaf worked in  outline should be begun at the lower or stalk end, and worked round  the right side to the top, taking care that the needle is to the left  of the thread as it is drawn out. When the point of the leaf is  reached, it is best to reverse the operation in working down the left  side towards the stalk again, so as to keep the needle to the right of  the thread instead of to the left, as in going up.    [Illustration: No. 2.]    The reason of this will be easily understood: we will suppose the leaf  to have a slightly serrated edge (and there is no leaf in nature with  an absolutely smooth one). It will be found that in order to give this  ragged appearance, it is necessary to have the points at which the  insertions of the needle occur on the outside of the leaf: whereas if  the stem stitch were continued down the left side, exactly in the same  manner as in ascending the right, we should have the ugly anomaly of a  leaf outlined thus:--    [Illustration: No. 3.]    If the leaf is to be worked \"solidly,\" another row of stem stitching  must be taken up the centre of it (unless it be a very narrow leaf),  to the top. The two halves of the leaf must then be filled in,  separately, with close, even rows of stem stitch, worked in the  ordinary way, with the needle to the left of the thread. This will  prevent the ugly ridge which remains in the centre, if it is worked  round and round the inside of the outline. Stem stitch must be varied  according to the work in hand. If a perfectly even line is required,  care must be taken that the direction of the needle when inserted is  in a straight line with the preceding stitch. If a slight serrature is  required, each stitch must be sloped a little by inserting the needle  at a slight angle, as shown in the illustration. The length of the  surface stitches must vary to suit the style of each piece of  embroidery.           *       *       *       *       *    _Split Stitch_ is worked like ordinary \"stem,\" except that the needle  is always brought up _through_ the crewel or silk, which it splits, in  passing.    The effect is to produce a more even line than is possible with the  most careful stem stitch. It is used for delicate outlines. Split  stitch is rarely used in hand embroidery, being more suitable for  frame work: but has been described here as being a form of stem  stitch. The effect is somewhat like a confused chain stitch.           *       *       *       *       *    _Satin Stitch_--_French Plumetis_--is one of those chiefly used in  white embroidery, and consists in taking the needle each time back  again almost to the spot from which it started, so that the same  amount of crewel or silk remains on the back of the work as on the  front. This produces a surface as smooth as satin: hence its name. It  is chiefly used in working the petals of small flowers, such as  \"Forget-me-nots,\" and in arabesque designs where a raised effect is  wanted in small masses.    [Illustration: No. 4.--SATIN STITCH.]           *       *       *       *       *    _Blanket Stitch_ is used for working the edges of table-covers,  mantel valances, blankets, &c., or for edging any other material. It  is simply a button-hole stitch, and may be varied in many ways by  sloping the stitches alternately to right and left; by working two or  three together, and leaving a space between them and the next set; or  by working a second row round the edge of the cloth over the first  with a different shade of wool.    [Illustration: No. 5.--BLANKET STITCH.]           *       *       *       *       *    _Knotted Stitch_, or _French Knot_, is used for the centres of such  flowers as the daisy or wild rose, and sometimes for the anthers of  others. The needle is brought up at the exact spot where the knot is  to be: the thread is held in the left hand, and twisted once or twice  round the needle, the point of which is then passed through the  fabric close to the spot where it came up: the right hand draws it  underneath, while the thumb of the left keeps the thread in its place  until the knot is secure. The knots are increased in size according to  the number of twists round the needle. When properly made, they should  look like beads, and lie in perfectly even and regular rows.    [Illustration: No. 6.--KNOTTED STITCH, or FRENCH KNOT.]    This stitch is very ancient, and does not seem confined to any  country, and the Chinese execute large and elaborate pieces of  embroidery in it, introducing beautiful shading. A curious specimen of  very fine knotting stitch was exhibited at the Royal School in 1878,  probably of French workmanship. It was a portrait of St. Ignatius  Loyola, not more than six inches in length, and was entirely executed  in knots of such fineness, that without a magnifying glass it was  impossible to discover the stitches. This, however, is a _tour de  force_, and not quoted as worthy of imitation.    There is one variety of this stitch, in which the thread is twisted a  great many times round the needle, so as to form a sort of curl  instead of a single knot. This is found in many ancient embroideries,  where it is used for the hair of saints and angels in ecclesiastical  work.    Knotted stitch was also employed largely in all its forms in the  curious and ingenious but ugly style in vogue during the reign of  James I., when the landscapes were frequently worked in cross, or  feather stitch, while the figures were raised over stuffing, and  dressed, as it were, in robes made entirely in point lace, or  button-hole stitches, executed in silk. The foliage of the trees and  shrubs which we generally find in these embroidered pictures, as well  as the hair in the figures, were worked in knotted stitches of varying  sizes, while the faces were in tent stitch or painted on white silk,  and fastened on to the canvas or linen ground.    [Illustration: No. 7.--BULLION KNOT.]    Another variety of knotting, which is still occasionally used,  resembles _bullion_, being made into a long roll. A stitch of the  length of the intended roll is taken in the material, the point of the  needle being brought to the surface again in the same spot from which  the thread originally started; the thread is then twisted eight or ten  times round the point of the needle, which is drawn out carefully  through the tunnel formed by the twists, this being kept in its place  by the left thumb. The point of the needle is then inserted once more  in the same place as it first entered the material, the long knot or  roll being drawn so as to lie evenly between the points of insertion  and re-appearance, thus treating the twisted thread as if it were  bullion or purl.           *       *       *       *       *    _Chain Stitch_ is but little used in embroidery now, although it may  sometimes be suitable for lines. It is made by taking a stitch from  right to left, and before the needle is drawn out the thread is  brought round towards the worker, and under the point of the needle.    [Illustration: No. 8.--CHAIN STITCH.]    The next stitch is taken from the point of the loop thus formed  forwards, and the thread again kept under the point, so that a regular  chain is formed on the surface of the material.    This chain stitch was much employed for ground patterns in the  beautiful gold-coloured work on linen for dress or furniture which  prevailed from the time of James I. to the middle of the eighteenth  century. It gave the appearance of quilting when worked on linen in  geometrical designs, or in fine and often-repeated arabesques.  Examples of it come to us from Germany and Spain, in which the design  is embroidered in satin stitch, or entirely filled in with solid  chain "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24968"],[0,"Behind the Scenes (#4)"],[1,"had  conspired against me were not viewed in a light to reflect much credit  upon them.    The savage efforts to subdue my pride were not the only things that  brought me suffering and deep mortification during my residence at  Hillsboro'. I was regarded as fair-looking for one of my race, and for  four years a white man--I spare the world his name--had base designs  upon me. I do not care to dwell upon this subject, for it is one that is  fraught with pain. Suffice it to say, that he persecuted me for four  years, and I--I--became a mother. The child of which he was the father  was the only child that I ever brought into the world. If my poor boy  ever suffered any humiliating pangs on account of birth, he could not  blame his mother, for God knows that she did not wish to give him life;  he must blame the edicts of that society which deemed it no crime to  undermine the virtue of girls in my then position.    Among the old letters preserved by my mother I find the following,  written by myself while at Hillsboro'. In this connection I desire to  state that Rev. Robert Burwell is now living[A] at Charlotte, North  Carolina:--        \"HILLSBORO', April 10, 1838.        \"MY DEAR MOTHER:--I have been intending to write to you for a      long time, but numerous things have prevented, and for that      reason you must excuse me.        \"I thought very hard of you for not writing to me, but hope      that you will answer this letter as soon as you receive it,      and tell me how you like Marsfield, and if you have seen any      of old acquaintances, or if you yet know any of the      brick-house people who I think so much of. I want to hear of      the family at home very much, indeed. I really believe you      and all the family have forgotten me, if not I certainly      should have heard from some of you since you left Boyton, if      it was only a line; nevertheless I love you all very dearly,      and shall, although I may never see you again, nor do I ever      expect to. Miss Anna is going to Petersburgh next winter, but      she says that she does not intend take me; what reason she      has for leaving me I cannot tell. I have often wished that I      lived where I knew I never could see you, for then I would      not have my hopes raised, and to be disappointed in this      manner; however, it is said that a bad beginning makes a good      ending, but I hardly expect to see that happy day at this      place. Give my love to all the family, both white and black.      I was very much obliged to you for the presents you sent me      last summer, though it is quite late in the day to be      thanking for them. Tell Aunt Bella that I was very much      obliged to her for her present; I have been so particular      with it that I have only worn it once.        \"There have been six weddings since October; the most      respectable one was about a fortnight ago; I was asked to be      the first attendant, but, as usual with all my expectations,      I was disappointed, for on the wedding-day I felt more like      being locked up in a three-cornered box than attending a      wedding. About a week before Christmas I was bridesmaid for      Ann Nash; when the night came I was in quite a trouble; I did      not know whether my frock was clean or dirty; I only had a      week's notice, and the body and sleeves to make, and only one      hour every night to work on it, so you can see with these      troubles to overcome my chance was rather slim. I must now      close, although I could fill ten pages with my griefs and      misfortunes; no tongue could express them as I feel; don't      forget me though; and answer my letters soon. I will write      you again, and would write more now, but Miss Anna says it is      time I had finished. Tell Miss Elizabeth that I wish she      would make haste and get married, for mistress says that I      belong to her when she gets married.        \"I wish you would send me a pretty frock this summer; if you      will send it to Mrs. Robertson's Miss Bet will send it to me.        \"Farewell, darling mother.          \"Your affectionate daughter,        \"ELIZABETH HOBBS.\"    [Footnote A: March, 1868.]          CHAPTER III    HOW I GAINED MY FREEDOM      The years passed and brought many changes to me, but on these I will not  dwell, as I wish to hasten to the most interesting part of my story. My  troubles in North Carolina were brought to an end by my unexpected  return to Virginia, where I lived with Mr. Garland, who had married Miss  Ann[e] Burwell, one of my old master's daughters. His life was not a  prosperous one, and after struggling with the world for several years he  left his native State, a disappointed man. He moved to St. Louis, hoping  to improve his fortune in the West; but ill luck followed him there, and  he seemed to be unable to escape from the influence of the evil star of  his destiny. When his family, myself included, joined him in his new  home on the banks of the Mississippi, we found him so poor that he was  unable to pay the dues on a letter advertised as in the post-office for  him. The necessities of the family were so great, that it was proposed  to place my mother out at service. The idea was shocking to me. Every  gray hair in her old head was dear to me, and I could not bear the  thought of her going to work for strangers. She had been raised in the  family, had watched the growth of each child from infancy to maturity;  they had been the objects of her kindest care, and she was wound round  about them as the vine winds itself about the rugged oak. They had been  the central figures in her dream of life--a dream beautiful to her,  since she had basked in the sunshine of no other. And now they proposed  to destroy each tendril of affection, to cloud the sunshine of her  existence when the day was drawing to a close, when the shadows of  solemn night were rapidly approaching. My mother, my poor aged mother,  go among strangers to toil for a living! No, a thousand times no! I  would rather work my fingers to the bone, bend over my sewing till the  film of blindness gathered in my eyes; nay, even beg from street to  street. I told Mr. Garland so, and he gave me permission to see what I  could do. I was fortunate in obtaining work, and in a short time I had  acquired something of a reputation as a seamstress and dress-maker. The  best ladies in St. Louis were my patrons, and when my reputation was  once established I never lacked for orders. With my needle I kept bread  in the mouths of seventeen persons for two years and five months. While  I was working so hard that others might live in comparative comfort, and  move in those circles of society to which their birth gave them  entrance, the thought often occurred to me whether I was really worth my  salt or not; and then perhaps the lips curled with a bitter sneer. It  may seem strange that I should place so much emphasis upon words  thoughtlessly, idly spoken; but then we do many strange things in life,  and cannot always explain the motives that actuate us. The heavy task  was too much for me, and my health began to give way. About this time  Mr. Keckley, whom I had met in Virginia, and learned to regard with more  than friendship, came to St. Louis. He sought my hand in marriage, and  for a long time I refused to consider his proposal; for I could not bear  the thought of bringing children into slavery--of adding one single  recruit to the millions bound to hopeless servitude, fettered and  shackled with chains stronger and heavier than manacles of iron. I made  a proposition to buy myself and son; the proposition was bluntly  declined, and I was commanded never to broach the subject again. I would  not be put off thus, for hope pointed to a freer, brighter life in the  future. Why should my son be held in slavery? I often asked myself. He  came into the world through no will of mine, and yet, God only knows how  I loved him. The Anglo-Saxon blood as well as the African flowed in his  veins; the two currents commingled--one singing of freedom, the other  silent and sullen with generations of despair. Why should not the  Anglo-Saxon triumph--why should it be weighed down with the rich blood  typical of the tropics? Must the life-current of one race bind the other  race in chains as strong and enduring as if there had been no  Anglo-Saxon taint? By the laws of God and nature, as interpreted by  man, one-half of my boy was free, and why should not this fair  birthright of freedom remove the curse from the other half--raise it  into the bright, joyous sunshine of liberty? I could not answer these  questions of my heart that almost maddened me, and I learned to regard  human philosophy with distrust. Much as I respected the authority of my  master, I could not remain silent on a subject that so nearly concerned  me. One day, when I insisted on knowing whether he would permit me to  purchase myself, and what price I must pay for myself, he turned to me  in a petulant manner, thrust his hand into his pocket, drew forth a  bright silver quarter of a dollar, and proffering it to me, said:    \"Lizzie, I have told you often not to trouble me with such a question.  If you really wish to leave me, take this: it will pay the passage of  yourself and boy on the ferry-boat, and when you are on the other side  of the river you will be free. It is the cheapest way that I know of to  accomplish what you desire.\"    I looked at him in astonishment, and earnestly replied: \"No, master, I  do not wish to be free in such a manner. If such had been my wish, I  should never have troubled you about obtaining your consent to my  purchasing myself. I can cross the river any day, as you well know, and  have frequently done so, but will never leave you in such a manner. By  the laws of the land I am your slave--you are my master, and I will only  be free by such means as the laws of the country provide.\" He expected  this answer,"]]]
