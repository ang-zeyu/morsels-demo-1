It is a gratifying sign  that one of the most prominent theorists of the time, an American  scholar, A.J. Goodrich, is adopting some such attitude toward music.  He carries dogma to the minimum, and accepts success in the individual  instance as sufficient authority for overstepping any general  principle. He refers to a contemporary American composer for authority  and example of some successful unconventionality with the same respect  with which he would quote a European's disregard of convention. His  pioneering is watched with interest abroad as well as here.    Worthy of mention along with Mr. Goodrich' original work is the effort  of Homer A. Norris to instil French ideas of musical theory. As a  counterweight to the German monopoly of our attention, his influence  is to be cordially welcomed.    Now that Americanism is rife in the land, some of the glowing interest  in things national might well be turned toward an art that has been  too much and too long neglected among us.    The time has come to take American music seriously. The day for  boasting is not yet here,--if indeed it ever comes; but the day of  penitent humility is surely past.    A student of the times, Mr. E.S. Martin, shortly before the Spanish  War, commented on the radical change that had come over the spirit of  American self-regard. We were notorious in the earlier half of the  century for boasting, not only of the virtues we indubitably had, but  of qualities that existed solely in our own imagination. We sounded  our barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. A century of almost  unanimous European disapproval, particularly of our artistic estate,  finally converted us from this attitude to one of deprecation almost  abject. Having learned the habit of modesty, it has clung to us even  now, when some of the foremost artists in the world are Americans.    Modesty, is, of course, one of the most beautiful of the virtues, but  excess is possible and dangerous. As Shakespeare's Florio's Montaigne  has it: \"We may so seize on vertue, that if we embrace it with an  over-greedy and violent desire, it may become vitious.\" In the case of  the American composer it is certainly true that we \"excessively  demeane ourselves in a good action.\" If, then, the glory of our late  successes in the field of battle shall bring about a recrudescence of  our old vanity, it will at least have its compensations.    Meanwhile, the American artist, having long ago ceased to credit  himself with all the virtues, has been for years earnestly working out  his own salvation in that spirit of solemn determination which makes  it proverbial for the American to get anything he sets his heart on.  He has submitted himself to a devout study of the Old Masters and the  New; he has made pilgrimage after pilgrimage to the ancient temples of  art, and has brought home influences that cannot but work for good.  The American painter has won more European acceptance than any of our  other artists, though this is partly due to his persistence in  knocking at the doors of the Paris salons, and gaining the universal  prestige of admission there. There is, unfortunately, no such place  to focus the attention of the world on a musician. Yet, through the  success of American musical students among their rivals abroad;  through the concerts they are giving more and more frequently in  foreign countries; through the fact that a number of European music  houses are publishing increasing quantities of American compositions,  he is making his way to foreign esteem almost more rapidly than at  home.    A prominent German critic, indeed, has recently put himself on record  as accepting the founding of an American school of music as a _fait  accompli_. And no student of the times, who will take the trouble to  seek the sources of our art, and observe its actual vitality, need be  ashamed of looking at the present state of music in America with a  substantial pride and a greater hope for the future.          CHAPTER II.    THE INNOVATORS.      _Edward Alexander MacDowell._    [Illustration: Autograph of Edward MacDowell]    The matter of precedence in creative art is as hopeless of solution as  it is unimportant. And yet it seems appropriate to say, in writing of  E.A. MacDowell, that an almost unanimous vote would grant him rank as  the greatest of American composers, while not a few ballots would  indicate him as the best of living music writers.    But this, to repeat, is not vital, the main thing being that MacDowell  has a distinct and impressive individuality, and uses his profound  scholarship in the pursuit of novelty that is not cheaply sensational,  and is yet novelty. He has, for instance, theories as to the textures  of sounds, and his chord-formations and progressions are quite his  own.    His compositions are superb processions, in which each participant is  got up with the utmost personal splendor. His generalship is great  enough to preserve the unity and the progress of the pageant. With him  no note in the melody is allowed to go neglected, ill-mounted on  common chords in the bass, or cheap-garbed in trite triads. Each tone  is made to suggest something of its multitudinous possibilities.  Through any geometrical point, an infinite number of lines can be  drawn. This is almost the case with any note of a melody. It is the  recognition and the practice of this truth that gives the latter-day  schools of music such a lusciousness and warmth of harmony. No one is  a more earnest student of these effects than MacDowell.    He believes that it is necessary, at this late day, if you would have  a chord \"bite,\" to put a trace of acid in its sweetness. With this  clue in mind, his unusual procedures become more explicable without  losing their charm.    New York is rather the Mecca than the birthplace of artists, but it  can boast the nativity of MacDowell, who improvised his first songs  here December 18, 1861. He began the study of the piano at an early  age. One of his teachers was Mme. Teresa Carreno, to whom he has  dedicated his second concerto for the piano.    In 1876 he went to Paris and entered the Conservatoire, where he  studied theory under Savard, and the piano under Marmontel. He went to  Wiesbaden to study with Ehlert in 1879, and then to Frankfort, where  Carl Heyman taught him piano and Joachim Raff composition. The  influence of Raff is of the utmost importance in MacDowell's music,  and I have been told that the great romancist made a _protege_ of him,  and would lock him in a room for hours till he had worked out the most  appalling musical problems. Through Raff's influence he became first  piano teacher at the Darmstadt Conservatorium in 1881. The next year  Raff introduced him to Liszt, who became so enthusiastic over his  compositions that he got him the honor of playing his first piano  suite before the formidable _Allgemeiner Deutscher Musik Verein_,  which accorded him a warm reception. The following years were spent in  successful concert work, till 1884, when MacDowell settled down to  teaching and composing in Wiesbaden. Four years later he came to  Boston, writing, teaching, and giving occasional concerts. Thence he  returned to New York, where he was called to the professorship of  music at Columbia University. Princeton University has given him that  unmusical degree, Mus. Doc.    MacDowell has met little or none of that critical recalcitrance that  blocked the early success of so many masters. His works succeeded from  the first in winning serious favor; they have been much played in  Germany, in Vienna, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, and Paris, one of them  having been performed three times in a single season at Breslau.    MacDowell's Scotch ancestry is always telling tales on him. The  \"Scotch snap\" is a constant rhythmic device, the old scale and the old  Scottish cadences seem to be native to his heart. Perhaps one might  find some kinship between MacDowell and the contemporary Glasgow  school of painters, that clique so isolated, so daring, and yet so  earnest and solid. Says James Huneker in a monograph published some  years ago: \"His coloring reminds me at times of Grieg, but when I  tracked the resemblance to its lair, I found only Scotch, as Grieg's  grand-folk were Greggs, and from Scotland. It is all Northern music  with something elemental in it, and absolutely free from the heavy,  languorous odors of the South or the morbidezza of Poland.\"    Some of MacDowell's most direct writing has been in the setting of the  poems of Burns, such as \"Deserted\" (\"Ye banks and braes o' bonnie  Doon,\" op. 9), \"Menie,\" and \"My Jean\" (op. 34). These are strongly  marked by that ineffably fine melodic flavor characteristic of  Scottish music, while in the accompaniments they admit a touch of the  composer's own individuality. In his accompaniments it is noteworthy  that he is almost never strictly contramelodic.    The songs of opera 11 and 12 have a decided Teutonism, but he has  found himself by opus 40, a volume of \"Six Love Songs,\" containing  half a dozen flawless gems it is a pity the public should not know  more widely. A later book, \"Eight Songs\" (op. 47), is also a cluster  of worthies. The lilt and sympathy of \"The Robin Sings in the  Apple-tree,\" and its unobtrusive new harmonies and novel effects, in  strange accord with truth of expression, mark all the other songs,  particularly the \"Midsummer Lullaby,\" with its accompaniment as  delicately tinted as summer clouds. Especially noble is \"The Sea,\"  which has all the boom and roll of the deep-brooding ocean.    His collections of flower-songs (op. 26) I confess not liking. Though  they are not without a certain exquisiteness, they seem overdainty  and wastefully frail, excepting, possibly, the \"Clover\" and the  \"Blue-bell.\" It is not at all their brevity, but their triviality,  that vexes an admirer of the large ability that labored over them.  They are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#4)"],[1,"  To those who have carefully examined the introduction and table of  contents, I am now prepared to give the following general direction;  _Fix upon a high standard of character._ To be _thought_ well of, is  not sufficient. The point you are to aim at, is, the greatest possible  degree of usefulness.    Some may think there is danger of setting _too high_ a standard of  action. I have heard teachers contend that a child will learn to write  much faster by having an _inferior copy_, than by imitating one which  is comparatively perfect; 'because,' say they, 'a pupil is liable to be  discouraged if you give him a _perfect_ copy; but if it is only a  little in advance of his own, he will take courage from the belief that  he shall soon be able to equal it.' I am fully convinced, however, that  this is not so. The _more_ perfect the copy you place before the child,  provided it be _written_, and not _engraved_, the better. For it must  always be _possible_ in the nature of things, for the child to imitate  it; and what is not absolutely impossible, every child may reasonably  be expected to aspire after, on the principle, that whatever man _has  done_, man _may_ do.    So in human conduct, generally; whatever is possible should be aimed  at. Did my limits permit, I might show that it is a part of the divine  economy to place before his rational creatures a perfect standard of  action, and to make it their duty to come up to it.    He who only aims at _little_, will _accomplish_ but little. _Expect_  great things, and _attempt_ great things. A neglect of this rule  produces more of the difference in the character, conduct, and success  of men, than is commonly supposed. Some start in life without any  leading object at all; some with a low one; and some aim high:--and  just in proportion to the elevation at which they aim, will be their  progress and success. It is an old proverb that he who aims at the sun,  will not reach it, to be sure, but his arrow will fly higher than if he  aims at an object on a level with himself. Exactly so is it, in the  formation of character, except in one point. To reach the sun with a  arrow is an impossibility, but a youth may aim high without attempting  impossibilities.    Let me repeat the assurance that, as a general rule, _you may be  whatever you will resolve to be_. Determine that you will be useful in  the world, and you _shall_ be. Young men seem to me utterly unconscious  of what they are capable of being and doing. Their efforts are often  few and feeble, because they are not awake to a full conviction that  any thing great or distinguished is in their power.    But whence came en Alexander, a Caesar, a Charles XII, or a Napoleon? Or  whence the better order of spirits,--a Paul, an Alfred, a Luther, a  Howard, a Penn, a Washington? Were not these men once like yourselves?  What but self exertion, aided by the blessing of Heaven, rendered these  men so conspicuous for usefulness? Rely upon it,--what these men once  _were_, you _may be_. Or at the least, you may make a nearer approach  to them, than you are ready to believe. Resolution is almost omnipotent.  Those little words, _try_, and _begin_, are sometimes great in their  results. 'I can't,' never accomplished any thing;--'I will try,' has  achieved wonders.    This position might be proved and illustrated by innumerable facts; but  one must suffice.    A young man who had wasted his patrimony by profligacy, whilst standing,  one day, on the brow of a precipice from which he had determined to  throw himself, formed the sudden resolution to regain what he had lost.  The purpose thus formed was kept; and though he began by shoveling a  load of coals into a cellar, for which he only received twelve and a  half cents, yet he proceeded from one step to another till he more than  recovered his lost possessions, and died worth sixty thousand pounds  sterling.    You will derive much advantage from a careful perusal of the lives of  eminent individuals, especially of those who were _good_ as well as  great. You will derive comparatively little benefit from reading the  lives of those scourges of their race who have drenched the earth in  blood, except so far as it tends to show you what an immense blessing  they _might_ have been to the world, had they devoted to the work of  human improvement those mighty energies which were employed in human  destruction. Could the physical and intellectual energy of Napoleon,  the order and method of Alfred, the industry, frugality, and wisdom of  Franklin and Washington, and the excellence and untiring perseverance  of Paul, and Penn, and Howard, be united in each individual of the  rising generation, who can set limits to the good, which they might,  and inevitably would accomplish! Is it too much to hope that some  happier age will witness the reality? Is it not even probable that the  rising generation may afford many such examples?      SECTION II. _On Motives to action._    Not a few young men either have no fixed principles, no governing  motive at all, or they are influenced by those which are low and  unworthy. It is painful to say this, but it is too true. On such, I  would press the importance of the following considerations.    Among the motives to action which I would present, the first is a  regard to _your own happiness_. To this you are by no means indifferent  at present. Nay, the attainment of happiness is your primary object.  You seek it in every desire, word, and action. But you sometimes  mistake the road that leads to it, either for the want of a friendly  hand to guide you, or because you refuse to be guided. Or what is most  common, you grasp at a smaller good, which is near, and apparently  certain, and in so doing cut yourselves off from the enjoyment of a  good which is often infinitely greater, though more remote.    Let me urge, in the second place, a regard for the family to which you  belong. It is true you can never fully know, unless the bitterness of  ingratitude should teach you, the extent of the duty you owe to your  relatives; and especially to your parents. You _cannot_ know--at least  till you are parents yourselves,--how their hearts are bound up in  yours. But if you do not _in some measure_ know it, till this late  period, you are not fit to be parents.    In the third place, it is due to society, particularly to the  neighborhood or sphere in which you move, and to the _associations_ to  which you may belong, that you strive to attain a very great elevation  of character. Here, too, I am well aware that it is impossible, at your  age, to perceive fully, how much you have it in your power to  contribute, if you will, to the happiness of those around you; and here  again let me refer you to the advice and guidance of aged friends.    But, fourthly, it is due to the nation and age to which you belong,  that you fix upon a high standard of character. This work is intended  for American youth. _American!_ did I say? This word, alone, ought to  call forth all your energies, and if there be a slumbering faculty  within you, arouse it to action. Never, since the creation, were the  youth of any age or country so imperiously called upon to exert  themselves, as those whom I now address. Never before were there so  many important interests at stake. Never were such immense results  depending upon a generation of men, as upon that which is now  approaching the stage of action. These rising millions are destined,  according to all human probability, to form by far the greatest nation  that ever constituted an entire community of freemen, since the world  began. To form the character of these millions involves a greater  amount of responsibility, individual and collective, than any other  work to which humanity has ever been called. And the reasons are, it  seems to me, obvious.    Now it is for you, my young friends, to determine whether these weighty  responsibilities shall be fulfilled. It is for you to decide whether  this _greatest_ of free nations shall, at the same time, be the _best_.  And as every nation is made up of individuals, you are each, in  reality, called upon daily, to settle this question: 'Shall the United  States, possessing the most ample means of instruction within the reach  of nearly all her citizens, the happiest government, the healthiest of  climates, the greatest abundance of the best and most wholesome  nutriment, with every other possible means for developing all the  powers of human nature, be peopled with the most vigorous, powerful,  and happy race of human beings which the world has ever known?'    There is another motive to which I beg leave, for one moment, to direct  your attention. You are bound to fix on a high standard of action, from  the desire of obeying the will of God. _He_ it is who has cast your lot  in a country which--all things considered--is the happiest below the  sun. _He_ it is who has given you such a wonderful capacity for  happiness, and instituted the delightful relations of parent and child,  and brother and sister, and friend and neighbor. I might add, _He_ it  is, too, who has given you the name _American_,--a name which alone  furnishes a passport to many civilized lands, and like a good  countenance, or a becoming dress, prepossesses every body in your  favor.    But what young man is there, I may be asked, who is not influenced more  or less, by all the motives which have been enumerated? Who is there  that does not seek his own happiness? Who does not desire to please his  parents and other relatives, his friends and his neighbors? Who does  not wish to be distinguished for his attachment to country and to  liberty? Nay, who has not even some regard, in his conduct, to the will  of God?    I grant that many young men, probably the most of those into whose  hands this book will be likely to fall, are influenced, more or less,  by all these considerations. All pursue their own happiness, no"]]]
