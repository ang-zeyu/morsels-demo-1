Excuse my being so patronising. You say you don't  know me, but when you do you'll discover what a worship I have for  propriety.\"    \"You're not conventional?\" Isabel gravely asked.    \"I like the way you utter that word! No, I'm not conventional: I'm  convention itself. You don't understand that?\" And he paused a moment,  smiling. \"I should like to explain it.\" Then with a sudden, quick,  bright naturalness, \"Do come back again,\" he pleaded. \"There are so many  things we might talk about.\"    She stood there with lowered eyes. \"What service did you speak of just  now?\"    \"Go and see my little daughter before you leave Florence. She's alone at  the villa; I decided not to send her to my sister, who hasn't at all my  ideas. Tell her she must love her poor father very much,\" said Gilbert  Osmond gently.    \"It will be a great pleasure to me to go,\" Isabel answered. \"I'll tell  her what you say. Once more good-bye.\"    On this he took a rapid, respectful leave. When he had gone she stood  a moment looking about her and seated herself slowly and with an air of  deliberation. She sat there till her companions came back, with  folded hands, gazing at the ugly carpet. Her agitation--for it had not  diminished--was very still, very deep. What had happened was something  that for a week past her imagination had been going forward to meet; but  here, when it came, she stopped--that sublime principle somehow broke  down. The working of this young lady's spirit was strange, and I can  only give it to you as I see it, not hoping to make it seem altogether  natural. Her imagination, as I say, now hung back: there was a last  vague space it couldn't cross--a dusky, uncertain tract which looked  ambiguous and even slightly treacherous, like a moorland seen in the  winter twilight. But she was to cross it yet.        CHAPTER XXX    She returned on the morrow to Florence, under her cousin's escort, and  Ralph Touchett, though usually restive under railway discipline, thought  very well of the successive hours passed in the train that hurried  his companion away from the city now distinguished by Gilbert Osmond's  preference--hours that were to form the first stage in a larger scheme  of travel. Miss Stackpole had remained behind; she was planning a little  trip to Naples, to be carried out with Mr. Bantling's aid. Isabel was  to have three days in Florence before the 4th of June, the date of Mrs.  Touchett's departure, and she determined to devote the last of these  to her promise to call on Pansy Osmond. Her plan, however, seemed for  a moment likely to modify itself in deference to an idea of Madame  Merle's. This lady was still at Casa Touchett; but she too was on the  point of leaving Florence, her next station being an ancient castle  in the mountains of Tuscany, the residence of a noble family of that  country, whose acquaintance (she had known them, as she said, \"forever\")  seemed to Isabel, in the light of certain photographs of their immense  crenellated dwelling which her friend was able to show her, a precious  privilege. She mentioned to this fortunate woman that Mr. Osmond had  asked her to take a look at his daughter, but didn't mention that he had  also made her a declaration of love.    \"Ah, comme cela se trouve!\" Madame Merle exclaimed. \"I myself have been  thinking it would be a kindness to pay the child a little visit before I  go off.\"    \"We can go together then,\" Isabel reasonably said: \"reasonably\" because  the proposal was not uttered in the spirit of enthusiasm. She had  prefigured her small pilgrimage as made in solitude; she should like  it better so. She was nevertheless prepared to sacrifice this mystic  sentiment to her great consideration for her friend.    That personage finely meditated. \"After all, why should we both go;  having, each of us, so much to do during these last hours?\"    \"Very good; I can easily go alone.\"    \"I don't know about your going alone--to the house of a handsome  bachelor. He has been married--but so long ago!\"    Isabel stared. \"When Mr. Osmond's away what does it matter?\"    \"They don't know he's away, you see.\"    \"They? Whom do you mean?\"    \"Every one. But perhaps it doesn't signify.\"    \"If you were going why shouldn't I?\" Isabel asked.    \"Because I'm an old frump and you're a beautiful young woman.\"    \"Granting all that, you've not promised.\"    \"How much you think of your promises!\" said the elder woman in mild  mockery.    \"I think a great deal of my promises. Does that surprise you?\"    \"You're right,\" Madame Merle audibly reflected. \"I really think you wish  to be kind to the child.\"    \"I wish very much to be kind to her.\"    \"Go and see her then; no one will be the wiser. And tell her I'd have  come if you hadn't. Or rather,\" Madame Merle added, \"DON'T tell her. She  won't care.\"    As Isabel drove, in the publicity of an open vehicle, along the winding  way which led to Mr. Osmond's hill-top, she wondered what her friend had  meant by no one's being the wiser. Once in a while, at large intervals,  this lady, whose voyaging discretion, as a general thing, was rather of  the open sea than of the risky channel, dropped a remark of ambiguous  quality, struck a note that sounded false. What cared Isabel Archer for  the vulgar judgements of obscure people? and did Madame Merle suppose  that she was capable of doing a thing at all if it had to be sneakingly  done? Of course not: she must have meant something else--something which  in the press of the hours that preceded her departure she had not had  time to explain. Isabel would return to this some day; there were sorts  of things as to which she liked to be clear. She heard Pansy strumming  at the piano in another place as she herself was ushered into Mr.  Osmond's drawing-room; the little girl was \"practising,\" and Isabel was  pleased to think she performed this duty with rigour. She immediately  came in, smoothing down her frock, and did the honours of her father's  house with a wide-eyed earnestness of courtesy. Isabel sat there half an  hour, and Pansy rose to the occasion as the small, winged fairy in the  pantomime soars by the aid of the dissimulated wire--not chattering, but  conversing, and showing the same respectful interest in Isabel's affairs  that Isabel was so good as to take in hers. Isabel wondered at her;  she had never had so directly presented to her nose the white flower  of cultivated sweetness. How well the child had been taught, said our  admiring young woman; how prettily she had been directed and fashioned;  and yet how simple, how natural, how innocent she had been kept! Isabel  was fond, ever, of the question of character and quality, of sounding,  as who should say, the deep personal mystery, and it had pleased her,  up to this time, to be in doubt as to whether this tender slip were not  really all-knowing. Was the extremity of her candour but the perfection  of self-consciousness? Was it put on to please her father's visitor,  or was it the direct expression of an unspotted nature? The hour that  Isabel spent in Mr. Osmond's beautiful empty, dusky rooms--the windows  had been half-darkened, to keep out the heat, and here and there,  through an easy crevice, the splendid summer day peeped in, lighting a  gleam of faded colour or tarnished gilt in the rich gloom--her interview  with the daughter of the house, I say, effectually settled this  question. Pansy was really a blank page, a pure white surface,  successfully kept so; she had neither art, nor guile, nor temper, nor  talent--only two or three small exquisite instincts: for knowing a  friend, for avoiding a mistake, for taking care of an old toy or a new  frock. Yet to be so tender was to be touching withal, and she could  be felt as an easy victim of fate. She would have no will, no power to  resist, no sense of her own importance; she would easily be mystified,  easily crushed: her force would be all in knowing when and where to  cling. She moved about the place with her visitor, who had asked leave  to walk through the other rooms again, where Pansy gave her judgement on  several works of art. She spoke of her prospects, her occupations, her  father's intentions; she was not egotistical, but felt the propriety  of supplying the information so distinguished a guest would naturally  expect.    \"Please tell me,\" she said, \"did papa, in Rome, go to see Madame  Catherine? He told me he would if he had time. Perhaps he had not time.  Papa likes a great deal of time. He wished to speak about my education;  it isn't finished yet, you know. I don't know what they can do with me  more; but it appears it's far from finished. Papa told me one day he  thought he would finish it himself; for the last year or two, at the  convent, the masters that teach the tall girls are so very dear. Papa's  not rich, and I should be very sorry if he were to pay much money for  me, because I don't think I'm worth it. I don't learn quickly enough,  and I have no memory. For what I'm told, yes--especially when it's  pleasant; but not for what I learn in a book. There was a young girl who  was my best friend, and they took her away from the convent, when she  was fourteen, to make--how do you say it in English?--to make a dot. You  don't say it in English? I hope it isn't wrong; I only mean they wished  to keep the money to marry her. I don't know whether it is for that that  papa wishes to keep the money--to marry me. It costs so much to marry!\"  Pansy went on with a sigh; \"I think papa might make that economy. At  any rate I'm too young to think about it yet, and I don't care for any  gentleman; I mean for any but him. If he were not my papa I should like  to marry him; I would rather be his daughter than the wife of--of some  strange person. I miss him very much, but not so much as you might  think, for I've been so much away from him. Papa has always"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#4)"],[1,"up gigantic tides. Pyrrus' two satellites, Samas and  Bessos, combine at times to pull the oceans up into thirty meter tides.  And until you've seen one of these tides lap over into an active volcano  you've seen nothing.    \"Heavy elements are what brought us to Pyrrus--and these same elements  keep the planet at a volcanic boil. There have been at least thirteen  super-novas in the immediate stellar neighborhood. Heavy elements can be  found on most of their planets of course--as well as completely  unbreathable atmospheres. Long-term mining and exploitation can't be  done by anything but a self-sustaining colony. Which meant Pyrrus. Where  the radioactive elements are locked in the planetary core, surrounded by  a shell of lighter ones. While this allows for the atmosphere men need,  it also provides unceasing volcanic activity as the molten plasma forces  its way to the surface.\"    For the first time Jason was silent. Trying to imagine what life could  be like on a planet constantly at war with itself.    \"I've saved the best for last,\" Kerk said with grim humor. \"Now that you  have an idea of what the environment is like--think of the kind of life  forms that would populate it. I doubt if there is one off-world species  that would live a minute. Plants and animals on Pyrrus are _tough_. They  fight the world and they fight each other. Hundreds of thousands of  years of genetic weeding-out have produced things that would give even  an electronic brain nightmares. Armor-plated, poisonous, claw-tipped and  fanged-mouthed. That describes everything that walks, flaps or just sits  and grows. Ever see a plant with teeth--that bite? I don't think you  want to. You'd have to be on Pyrrus and that means you would be dead  within seconds of leaving the ship. Even I'll have to take a refresher  course before I'll be able to go outside the landing buildings. The  unending war for survival keeps the life forms competing and changing.  Death is simple, but the ways of dealing it too numerous to list.\"    Unhappiness rode like a weight on Kerk's broad shoulders. After long  moments of thought he moved visibly to shake it off. Returning his  attention to his food and mopping the gravy from his plate, he voiced  part of his feelings.    \"I suppose there is no logical reason why we should stay and fight this  endless war. Except that Pyrrus is our home.\" The last piece of  gravy-soaked bread vanished and he waved the empty fork at Jason.    \"Be happy you're an off-worlder and will never have to see it.\"    \"That's where you're wrong.\" Jason said as calmly as he could. \"You see,  I'm going back with you.\"          IV.      \"Don't talk stupidly,\" Kerk said as he punched for a duplicate order of  steak. \"There are much simpler ways of committing suicide. Don't you  realize that you're a millionaire now? With what you have in your pocket  you can relax the rest of your life on the pleasure planets. Pyrrus is a  death world, not a sightseeing spot for jaded tourists. I cannot permit  you to return with me.\"    Gamblers who lose their tempers don't last long. Jason was angry now.  Yet it showed only in a negative way. In the lack of expression on his  face and the calmness of his voice.    \"Don't tell me what I can or cannot do, Kerk Pyrrus. You're a big man  with a fast gun--but that doesn't make you my boss. All you can do is  stop me from going back on your ship. But I can easily afford to get  there another way. And don't try to tell me I want to go to Pyrrus for  sightseeing when you have no idea of my real reasons.\"    Jason didn't even try to explain his reasons, they were only half  realized and too personal. The more he traveled, the more things looked  the same to him. The old, civilized planets sank into a drab similarity.  Frontier worlds all had the crude sameness of temporary camps in a  forest. Not that the galactic worlds bored him. It was just that he had  found their limitations--yet had never found his own. Until he met Kerk  he had acknowledged no man his superior, or even his equal. This was  more than egotism. It was facing facts. Now he was forced to face the  fact that there was a whole world of people who might be superior to  him. Jason could never rest content until he had been there and seen for  himself. Even if he died in the attempt.    None of this could be told to Kerk. There were other reasons he would  understand better.    \"You're not thinking ahead when you prevent me from going to Pyrrus,\"  Jason said. \"I'll not mention any moral debt you owe me for winning that  money you needed. But what about the next time? If you needed that much  lethal goods once, you'll probably need it again some day. Wouldn't it  be better to have me on hand--old tried and true--than dreaming up some  new and possibly unreliable scheme?\"    Kerk chewed pensively on the second serving of steak. \"That makes sense.  And I must admit I hadn't thought of it before. One failing we Pyrrans  have is a lack of interest in the future. Staying alive day by day is  enough trouble. So we tend to face emergencies as they arrive and let  the dim future take care of itself. You can come. I hope you will still  be alive when we need you. As Pyrran ambassador to a lot of places I  officially invite you to our planet. All expenses paid. On the condition  you obey completely all our instructions regarding your personal  safety.\"    \"Conditions accepted,\" Jason said. And wondered why he was so cheerful  about signing his own death warrant.    Kerk was shoveling his way through his third dessert when his alarm  watch gave a tiny hum. He dropped his fork instantly and stood up. \"Time  to go,\" he said. \"We're on schedule now.\" While Jason scrambled to his  feet, he jammed coins into the meter until the _paid_ light came on.  Then they were out the door and walking fast.    Jason wasn't at all surprised when they came on a public escalator just  behind the restaurant. He was beginning to realize that since leaving  the Casino their every move had been carefully planned and timed.  Without a doubt the alarm was out and the entire planet being searched  for them. Yet so far they hadn't noticed the slightest sign of pursuit.  This wasn't the first time Jason had to move just one jump ahead of the  authorities--but it was the first time he had let someone else lead him  by the hand while he did it. He had to smile at his own automatic  agreement. He had been a loner for so many years that he found a certain  inverse pleasure in following someone else.    \"Hurry up,\" Kerk growled after a quick glance at his watch. He set a  steady, killing pace up the escalator steps. They went up five levels  that way--without seeing another person--before Kerk relented and let  the escalator do the work.    Jason prided himself on keeping in condition. But the sudden climb,  after the sleepless night, left him panting heavily and soaked with  sweat. Kerk, cool of forehead and breathing normally, didn't show the  slightest sign that he had been running.    They were at the second motor level when Kerk stepped off the slowly  rising steps and waved Jason after him. As they came through the exit to  the street a car pulled up to the curb in front of them. Jason had  enough sense not to reach for his gun. At the exact moment they reached  the car the driver opened the door and stepped out. Kerk passed him a  slip of paper without saying a word and slipped in behind the wheel.  There was just time for Jason to jump in before the car pulled away. The  entire transfer had taken less than three seconds.    There had been only a glimpse of the driver in the dim light, but Jason  had recognized him. Of course he had never seen the man before, but  after knowing Kerk he couldn't mistake the compact strength of a native  Pyrran.    \"That was the receipt from Ellus you gave him,\" Jason said.    \"Of course. That takes care of the ship and the cargo. They'll be  off-planet and safely away before the casino check is traced to Ellus.  So now let's look after ourselves. I'll explain the plan in detail so  there will be no slip-ups on your part. I'll go through the whole thing  once and if there are any questions you'll ask them when I'm finished.\"    The tones of command were so automatic that Jason found himself  listening in quiet obedience. Though one part of his mind wanted him to  smile at the quick assumption of his incompetence.    Kerk swung the car into the steady line of traffic heading out of the  city to the spaceport. He drove easily while he talked.    \"There is a search on in the city, but we're well ahead of that. I'm  sure the Cassylians don't want to advertise their bad sportsmanship so  there won't be anything as crude as a roadblock. But the port will be  crawling with every agent they have. They know once the money gets  off-planet it is gone forever. When we make a break for it they will be  sure we still have the goods. So there will be no trouble with the  munition ship getting clear.\"    Jason sounded a little shocked. \"You mean you're setting us up as clay  pigeons to cover the take-off of the ship.\"    \"You could put it that way. But since we have to get off-planet anyway,  there is no harm in using our escape as a smokescreen. Now shut up until  I've finished, like I told you. One more interruption and I dump you by  the road.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jason was sure he would. He listened intently--and quietly--as Kerk  repeated word for word what he had said before, then continued.    \"The official car gate will probably be wide open with the traffic  through it. And a lot of the agents will be in plain clothes. We might  even get onto the field without being recognized, though I doubt it. It  is of no importance. We will drive through the gate and to the take-off  pad. The _Pride of Darkhan_, for which we hold tickets, will be sounding  its two-minute siren and unhooking the gangway. By the time we get to  our seats "]]]
