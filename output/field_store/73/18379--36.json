The exposure required is  ascertained by a trial or two, but roughly speaking is about one-twentieth  that of a rapid plate. After development in the usual way--it being  carried only a little further than usual--and after fixing, washing and  drying, the paper negative can be spotted or retouched, after which it is  waxed.          CHAPTER IV    ENLARGING--DAYLIGHT METHODS      In taking up enlarging a full knowledge of what has been said as to the  manipulation of bromide paper will be necessary, as the principles  governing exposure apply here as in contact printing, errors being even  more serious, owing to the greater waste of material.    For the illuminant used in enlarging, we may employ either daylight or  artificial light. The former is cheap, but variable; the first cost of the  latter is quite a little sum, but the light is uniform. A daylight  enlarging apparatus can be made for a dollar or two, and hence is within  the reach of all; and if the process be given up, the loss is not serious.    If the cost is of little or no moment, very serviceable enlarging cameras  can be bought for about twenty-five dollars. Such a camera is adapted for  reducing as well as enlarging, and so will be found useful for lantern  slide making, copying, etc. As a matter of fact, few things are as useful  to the amateur as a good enlarging outfit.    We will first consider enlarging by daylight with home-made apparatus. For  this purpose a room with at least one window will be needed. It should  preferably be convenient to the dark-room. If the window of this room  commands a view unobstructed by buildings, trees or the like, so much the  better. I personally prefer a south light. With this one can get soft  enlargements from the most contrasty negatives, while by shielding the  negatives from the direct rays of the sun we can work from negatives which  are quite flat and lacking in contrasts.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    But whatever the room chosen, all windows but the one at which we are to  work must be blocked up. This can be done by heavy dark curtains, or by  specially constructed frames covered with light-tight material and made to  fit closely in the windows. If there are any transoms these should  likewise be covered. White light entering under the doors can be shut out  by placing a rug along the bottom of the door. Care must be taken that the  window-frames fit closely, as the light from openings at the windows would  soon fog a sheet of bromide paper if it fell upon it even for a few  moments.    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    Assuming that the room chosen can be made practically light-tight, we will  need some arrangement to hold the negative. The details of a box for this  purpose can best be shown by a diagram (Fig. 3). ABCD is a strong and  neatly made box open at both ends, and about two inches larger each way  than the largest negative from which enlargements are to be made. E  represents a section of a board which forms part of a window frame, a  general view of which is given in Fig. 4. Reverting to Fig. 3, F is an  opening cut in the side of the negative box two inches or a little less  from the back of the box, AD, and wide enough to admit the free passage of  a negative in a kit or other holder. On the inside of the box are tacked  strips, GGGG, to serve as a guide to the kit when placing it in the box.  An opening similar to F should be made in the other side of the box to  permit lateral adjustments when we come to use the apparatus, besides  enabling us to put the negative in or withdraw it from either side. A  convenient modification of the strips, G, is found by placing the front  ones a short distance further forward, to wit, toward BC, as they are  shown in the cut (Fig. 3), and tacking to them a piece of watch spring, H,  this then serving both as a guide and as a means of pressing the kit or  negative holder against the other strips, GG (Fig. 5).    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    J is a sheet of ground-glass, which is tacked over the opening when the  box is firmly set in the board, E. It is well to have this ground-glass  fixed in place so that it can be readily removed if desired.    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    The necessity for having the box at least two inches larger each way than  the largest negative from which enlargements are to be made is shown in  Fig. 6. Here AB represents the negative in place, CA, DB and EG represent  rays of light entering the box. It will be seen that the rays CA and DB  strike the ground-glass at an angle, but nevertheless at an angle which  results in their passing through it in a considerable degree. They strike  the negative AB, but if the negative were the full size of the box, to wit  FG, it will be seen that while the section AB would be fully lighted, the  sections AF and BG would receive no oblique rays at all, and hence the  negative would not be even approximately uniformly lighted. This point is  too often overlooked in the construction of apparatus of this character,  but is necessary in all cases of daylight enlarging and especially when  direct sunlight is used. Now with the negative box in place, some  arrangement must be made for holding the lens, which can be the lens used  for making the negative. This for enlargements of a fixed size from  negatives of a given size can be accomplished by simply extending the  section BGGC Fig. 3, to a proper distance and placing the lens in the end  of it; but this permits too little opportunity for adjustments and is not  advisable. A double box, one sliding within the other, would be better,  but still not quite satisfactory. It is far better to adapt one's camera  to the apparatus, and this can always be done; it being very simple with a  reversible back camera, which can be backed right up to the opening, and  more difficult but always possible with others. Fig. 7 shows the entire  apparatus in place, and the manner in which it is used. AB is the window  board, C is the negative box, D is the camera adjusted to the latter, E is  the enlarging screen on an easel to hold the bromide paper, and F is the  reflector. The screen on the easel can be made either to rest on the floor  or on a table. It can be made to run on a track or otherwise, and it can  also be made so as to admit of either vertical or lateral adjustment or  both, or it can be nothing more than an ordinary box set on a table. But  however constructed it must be considerably larger than the largest sheet  of bromide paper which is to be used, thus allowing for nearly all  necessary adjustments of the paper. It is preferably covered with white  paper or fine blotter to aid in focusing. The reflector F is considerably  larger than the negative-box, and adjusted at an angle which will reflect  the light from the sky or sun evenly upon the ground glass. It is best  covered with good white blotting paper. G is a hood which I have found  useful in sunlight enlarging, especially in summer when the sun is almost  overhead. It is placed on the outside of the window-frame, some distance  above the ground-glass, and shields the latter from the direct rays of the  sun, which would otherwise cause uneven illumination owing to their too  great obliquity. The direct sun on the white reflector will give a light  of high intensity. In winter, however, when the sun is low, it will fall  directly on the ground-glass, and this, if the negative box be constructed  as advised, is not objectionable, but on the contrary an advantage. In  Fig. 4 the opening, FGHI, represents a sheet of ruby glass, and can be  screened while focusing if found to interfere with the worker's  convenience in that operation.    [Illustration: Fig. 7]    The apparatus as sketched will suffice for all ordinary work.  Modifications of it will depend upon the ingenuity of the man who attempts  to design or construct one. It should be noted that the distance of the  ground-glass from the negative has its influence in the strength of the  light, and it is better to have this distance not over two inches. If less  than one inch, however, the diffusion of light is not so good. When the  light is weak the ground-glass can be removed entirely; the negative will  thus be viewed directly against the white reflector. Very strong negatives  giving undue contrasts may also be dealt with in this way. Or, if the  light is too strong for flat negatives, the reflector can be removed  entirely, or to the same end a sheet of yellow glass can be substituted  for the ground-glass, thus increasing contrasts. In fact, a very useful  and easily arranged modification of the negative-box consists of an  opening in the top of the box inside the room through which can be dropped  an extra sheet of ground-glass or opal to cut down the light, or of yellow  glass to increase contrast. This opening should be at the point K, Fig. 3.    I have referred to a kit as being the proper arrangement for holding the  negative. This, after much tribulation in working with home-made  contrivances, I have found to be the best arrangement. They come a size or  two larger than the negative with which they are to be used, and can  easily be cut down to the proper dimensions. With it, also, other kits to  hold smaller negatives can readily be used. It is also simple with them to  fasten the negatives in place. If they extend beyond the box on either  side so much the better; greater lateral adjustment can then be made. The  negative box, Fig. 3, is best painted dead black inside in the section  GBCG, and white in the section AGGD. The reasons for this will be obvious  at a glance.    In enlarging from films it is well to place them between two sheets of  glass of proper size, and fasten the whole in the kit or negative-holder.  For this purpose use thin glass without flaws or scratches. If the films  are smaller than the opening in the kit, it is well to paste a black mat  on one of the glasses, when, after proper adjustment,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24647"],[0,"The Standard Operaglass (#4)"],[1,"  In the midst of this scene Mesrur, messenger  of the Calif, appears, to find out whether Fatima is really dead.  The  Calif and his wife having each received news of the death of the  other's favorite, want to know, who it was, that died, and--if both are  dead--who died first.  The Calif affirms, that it is Fatima--his wife,  that it is Abu Hassan.  They have made a bet, and Mesrur, seeing Fatima  lying motionless on the divan, covered with the brocade, and her  husband in evident distress beside her, runs away to convey the tidings  to the Calif.  He is hardly gone, when Zobeide's nurse, Zemrud comes on  a similar errand from her mistress.  Fatima, who has just covered her  husband with {3} the brocade, receives her with tears and laments, and  the nurse departs triumphantly.    Hassan presently comes to life again but he and Fatima are not long  permitted to congratulate one another on the success of their scheme,  for the arrival of the Calif with his wife is pompously announced.  Both throw themselves on the divans, covering themselves, and so the  august couple finds them dead.  The Calif, much afflicted by the sight,  offers 1000 gold pieces to anyone, who can tell him, which of the two  died first.  No sooner does Hassan hear this than tearing aside his  cover, he throws himself at the Calif's feet, crying out: \"It was I,  who died first!\" at the same time craving the Calif's pardon together  with the gold pieces.  Fatima is also speedily resuscitated and the  Calif pardons his favorites, Hassan meanwhile asserting, that he only  died badly, in order to live better.  Omar, who has paid their bills in  the hope of winning Fatima's love, is driven away in disgrace.          L'AFRICAINE.    Opera in five acts by MEYERBEER.    Text by E. SCRIBE, translated by GUMPERT.      L'Africaine, one of the Maestro's last operas (1865), unites in itself  all the strength and at the same time all the weakness of Meyerbeer's  composition.    The music is easy flowing and enthralls us with its delicious melodies;  but it only appeals to our senses, and nobler thoughts are altogether  {4} wanting.  Nevertheless the opera finds favor by reason of these  advantages, which are supplemented by an interesting, though rather  improbable libretto.    The famous Portuguese navigator Vasco de Gama (born in 1469) is the  hero, though he does not appear in the best possible light, and is by  no means strictly historical.    The first scene is laid in Lisbon.  Donna Ines, Admiral Diego's  daughter is to give her hand to Don Pedro, a counsellor of King  Emmanuel of Portugal.  But she has pledged her faith to Vasco de Gama,  who has been sent with Diaz, the navigator, to double the Cape, in  order to seek for a new land, containing treasures, similar to those  discovered by Columbus.  Reports have reached Lisbon, that the whole  fleet has been destroyed, when suddenly Vasco de Gama appears before  the assembled council of state.    He eloquently describes the dangers of the unknown seas near the Cape  and gives an account of the shipwreck, from which he alone has escaped.  He then places his maps before the council, endeavouring to prove, that  beyond Africa there is another country, yet to be explored and  conquered.    Vasco has on his way home picked up a man and a woman of an unknown  race.  Those slaves however stubbornly refuse to betray the name of  their country, and a lively debate ensues between the Grand Inquisitor  and the younger more enlightened members of the council, as to the  course, which should be adopted with Vasco.  At last, owing to {5} the  irritation caused by his violent reproaches, fanaticism is victorious,  and instead of being furnished with a ship to explore those unknown  lands, he is thrown into prison, on the plea of his being a heretic,  for having maintained the existence of countries which were not  mentioned in the Holy Scriptures.    The second act takes place in a cell of the Inquisition, in which Vasco  has been languishing for a month past, in the company of the strange  slaves Nelusco and Selica.  The latter has lost her heart to the proud  Portuguese, who saved her and her companion from a slave-ship.  But  Vasco is only thinking of Ines, and Nelusco, who honors in Selica not  only his Queen, but the woman of his love, tries to stab Vasco--the  Christian, whom he hates with a deadly hatred.  Selica hinders him and  rouses the sleeping Vasco, who has been dreaming of and planning his  voyage to the unknown country.    Selica now shows him on the map the way to her native isle, and he vows  her eternal gratitude.  His liberty is indeed near at hand, for hardly  has he given his vow, than Ines steps in to announce that Vasco is  free.  She has paid dearly for her lover's deliverance however, for she  has given her hand to Vasco's rival Don Pedro, who, having got all  Vasco's plans and maps, is commissioned by government, to set out on  the voyage of discovery.    Ines has been told, that Vasco has forgotten her for Selica the slave.  In order to prove his fidelity, our ungrateful hero immediately  presents {6} her with the two slaves, and Don Pedro resolves to make  use of them for his exploration.    In the third act we are on board of Don Pedro's ship in the Indian  seas.  Donna Ines is with her husband and Nelusco has been appointed  pilot.  Don Alvar, a member of the council and Don Pedro's friend,  warns the latter, that Nelusco is meditating treason, for they have  already lost two ships; but Pedro disregards the warning.  A typhoon  arises, and Nelusco turns the ship again northward.  But Vasco has  found means to follow them on a small sailing vessel; he overtakes them  and knowing the spot well where Diaz was shipwrecked, he entreats them  to change their course, his only thought being Donna Ines' safety.  But  Pedro, delighted to have his rival in his power, orders him to be bound  and shot.  Ines hearing his voice, invokes her husband's mercy.  Just  then the tempest breaks out, the vessel strikes upon a rock and the  cannibals inhabiting the neighboring country leap on board to liberate  their Queen Selica and to massacre the whole crew, in the fulfilment of  which intention they are however arrested by Selica.    In the following acts Selica resides as Queen on the Isle of  Madagascar.  The people render her homage, but her priests demand the  strangers' lives as a sacrifice to their gods, while the women are  condemned to inhale the poisoned perfume of the Manzanillo-tree.--In  order to save Vasco Selica proclaims him her husband and takes Nelusco  {7} as witness, swearing to him that if Vasco is sacrificed she will  die with him.  Nelusco, whose love for his Queen is greater even than  his hatred for Vasco, vouches for their being man and wife, and the  people now proceed to celebrate the solemn rites of marriage.    Vasco, at last recognizing Selica's great love, and believing Ines  dead, once more vows eternal fidelity to her, but alas, hearing the  voice of Ines, who is about to be led to death, he turns pale and  Selica but too truly divines the reason.    In the fifth act Selica is resolved to put her rival to death.  She  sends for her, but perceiving Ines' love, her wrath vanishes, her  magnanimity soars above her hatred of the Christians, and she orders  Nelusco to bring Ines and Vasco on board of a ship about to sail for  Portugal.    Selica herself, unable to endure life without her beloved-one, proceeds  to the Cape, where the Manzanillo-tree spreads his poisonous  shade.--Her eyes fastened on the vast ocean and on the white sail of  the retiring vessel, she inhales the sweet but deadly perfume of the  blossoms and the returning Nelusco finds her dying, while an unseen  chorus consoles her with the thought that in Love's eternal domain all  are equal.          {8}    AIDA.    Grand romantic Opera in four acts by GIUSEPPE VERDI.    Text by ANTONIO GHISLANZONI.  Translated into German by S. SCHANZ.  English version by KENNEY.      This opera owes its great popularity not only to its brilliant music  and skilful instrumentation, but also to its really magnificent outfit  and decorations.  Aida ranks among the best operas of Verdi.  The plot  is taken from old Egypt; and the music, with its eastern and somewhat  sensuous coloring is exquisitely adapted to the scenery.    The scene of action is alternately Memphis and Thebes and the story  belongs to the period when the Pharaohs sat on the throne.    In the first act we see the King's palace at Memphis.  Ramphis, the  Highpriest of Pharaoh announces to the Egyptian General Radames, that  the Ethiopians are in revolt and that the goddess Isis has decided who  shall be leader of the army sent out against them.  Radames secretly  hopes to be the elected, in order to win the Ethiopian slave Aida, whom  he loves, not knowing that she is a King's daughter.    Enter Amneris, daughter of Pharaoh.  She loves Radames without his  knowledge and so does Aida.  Amneris, suspecting this, swears to avenge  herself, should her suspicion prove correct.    The King's messenger announces, that Amonasro, the Ethiopian King  (Aida's father), is marching to the capital, and that Radames is chosen  to conquer the foe.  Radames goes to the temple {9} to invoke the  benediction of the goddess and to receive the sacred arms.    In the second act Amneris, in order to test Aida's feelings, tells her,  that Radames fell in battle, and finds her doubts confirmed by Aida's  terror.  Amneris openly threatens her rival, and both hasten to receive  the soldiers, who return victorious.  In Radames' suite walks King  Amonasro, who has been taken prisoner, disguised as a simple officer.  Aida recognizes her father, and Amonasro telling his conqueror, that  the Ethiopian King has fallen, implores his clemency.  Radames, seeing  Aida in tears, adds his entreaties to those of the Ethiopian; and  Pharaoh decides to set the prisoners free, with the exception of"]]]
