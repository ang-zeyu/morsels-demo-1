The strong are going forward, the magnanimous feel more deeply, the  proud rise higher, and yet will you not lay down the cedar in order that  it may not outgrow the grass?    Or will you not spread your wings over mediocrity, or will you not  shield indifference, and protect the gray and uniformly fleeced herd?           *       *       *    You frighten me.    As conquerors you might become the bureaucracy: to dole out to everybody  his morsel, as is the usage in the poor-house; to arrange work for  everybody as it is done in the galleys. And you will thus crush the  creator of new worlds--the free human will, and fill up with earth the  purest spring of human happiness--human initiative, the power which  braves one against thousands, against peoples, and against generations?  And you will systematize life and bid it to remain on the level of the  crowd.    And will you not be occupied with regulations: registrating, recording,  estimating--or will you not prescribe how fast and how often the human  pulse must beat, how far the human eye may look ahead, how much the ear  may perceive, and what kinds of dreams the languishing heart may  entertain?           *       *       *    With joy in my heart I look at you when you tear down the gates of  Sodom, but my heart trembles at the same time, fearing that you might  erect on its ruins new ones--more chilling and darker ones.    There will be no houses without windows; but fog will envelop the  souls....    There will be no empty stomachs, but souls will starve. No ear will hear  cries of woe, but the eagle--the human intellect--will stand at the  trough with clipped wings together with the cow and the ox.    And justice, which has accompanied you on the thorny and bloody path to  victory, will forsake you, and you will not be aware of it, for  conquerors and tyrants are always blind. You will conquer and dominate.  And you will plunge into injustice, and you will not feel the quagmire  under your feet.... Every tyrant thinks he stands on firm ground so long  as he has not been vanquished.    And you will build prisons for those who dare to stretch out their  hands, pointing to the abyss into which you sink; you will tear out the  tongues of the mouths that warn you against those who come after you, to  destroy you and your injustice....    Cruelly will you defend the equality of rights of the herd to use the  grass under its feet and the salt in the ground,--and your enemies will  be the free individuals, the overmen, the ingenious inventors, the  prophets, the saviors, the poets and artists.           *       *       *    Everything that comes to pass occurs in space and time.... The present  is the existing: the stable, the firm, and therefore the rigid and  frozen--the to-day, which will and must perish....    Time is change--it varies and develops; it is the eternally sprouting,  the blossoming, the eternal morning....    And as your \"morning,\" to which you aspire, will become the \"to-day,\"  you will become the upholders of the \"yesterday,\" of that which is  lifeless--dead. You will trample the sproutings of to-morrow and destroy  its blossoms, and pour streams of cold water upon the heads that nestle  your prophecies, your dreams, and your new hopes.    The to-day is unwilling to die, bloody is every sunset....    I yearn and hope for your victory, but I fear and tremble for your  victory.    You are my hope, and you are my fear.

He was on an agitation  trip, and when he reached Cincinnati he took sick with erysipelas and  died within a few days, surrounded by his comrades.    Shortly before that he had the fortune to taste of the kindness and good  breeding of the police once more. Some friends in Philadelphia arranged  a meeting to celebrate Most's sixtieth birthday. He was one of the  speakers; but the police of that city interpreted the American  Constitution, which speaks of the right to free speech and assembly, as  giving the right to forcibly disperse the meeting.    Conscious misrepresentation and ignorance, the twin angels that hover  over the throne of the newspaper kingdom of this country, have made John  Most a scarecrow. Organized police authorities and police justices that  can neither be accused of a surplus of intelligence nor even of the  shadow of love of fairness, made him their target whenever they felt the  great calling to save their country from disaster. Naturally the mob of  law-abiding citizens must be assured from time to time that their  masters have a sacred duty to perform, that they earn the right of  graft.    Most was born at Augsburg, Bavaria, February 5, 1846. According to his  memoirs, he early found it necessary to resist the tyranny of a  stepmother and the miserable treatment of his master. As a bookbinder  apprentice, at a very early age, he took to his heels and went on the  road of the world, where he soon came in contact with revolutionary  ideas in the labor movement that greatly inspired him and urged him to  read and study. It might be more appropriately said that he developed a  ravenous appetite for knowledge and research of all the works of human  science.    At that time socialistic ideas had just begun to exercise great  influence upon the thinking mind of the European continents. The zeal  and craving for knowledge displayed by the working people of those days  can hardly be properly estimated, especially by the proletariat of this  country, whose literature and source of knowledge chiefly consists of  the daily papers. Workingmen, who worked ten and twelve hours in  factories and shops, spent their evenings in study and reading of  economic, political and philosophic works--Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl  Marx, Engels, Bakunin and, later, Kropotkin; also Henry George's  \"Progress and Poverty.\" Added to these were the works of the  materialistic-natural science schools, such as Darwin, Huxley,  Molleschot, Karl Vogt, Ludwig Buechner, Haeckel, that constituted the  mental diet of a large number of workingmen of that period. Just as the  revolutionary economists were hailed as the liberators of physical  slavery, so were the materialistic, naturalistic sciences accepted as  the saviors from mental narrowness and darkness.    Most was untiring in his work of popularizing these ideas, and as he  could quickly grasp things he was tremendously successful in simplifying  scientific books into pamphlets and essays, accessible to the ordinary  intelligence of the working people. He possessed a marvelous memory, and  once he got hold of an amount of data he could easily avail himself of  it at any moment. This was particularly true in the domain of history,  with its compilation of bloodcurdling events, from which he drew his  conclusions of how the human race ought _not to live_.    Together with his journalistic activity, he combined oral propaganda.  His power of delivery was marvelous, and those who heard him in his  early days will understand why the powers of the world stood in awe  before him. He not only had a very convincing way, but he succeeded in  keeping his audiences spellbound or to bring them up to the highest  pitch of enthusiasm.    The scene of his first great activity was in Vienna, where he was soon  met with many indictments and persecutions from the authorities, who  mercilessly pursued him for the rest of his life. After a term of  imprisonment in several American prisons, he went to Germany, where he  became the editor of the \"Free Press\" in Berlin, but his original and  biting criticism of bureaucracy again brought him in conflict with the  powers that be. The Berlin prison, Ploetzensee, soon closed its doors on  the culprit. Even to-day those who visit that famous institution of  civilization are still shown Most's cell.    At that time Bismarck carried an unsuccessful battle against the power  of the Catholic Church, eager to subordinate her to the State authority.  It happened that the famous leader of the Catholic party, Majunke, was  sent for a term of imprisonment to Ploetzensee. When the prisoners were  led out for their daily walk, the leader of the Reds, John Most, met the  leader of the Blacks, Majunke. The situation was comical enough to cause  amusement to both; both being brilliant, they found enough interesting  material for conversation, which helped them over the dreariness and  monotony of prison life.    Several years later Bismarck succeeded in enacting the muzzle law  against Social Democracy, which destroyed the freedom of the press and  assembly. The question arose then what could be done.    Most had been elected to the Reichstag, representing the famous factory  town Chemnitz, but his experience in Parliament only served him to  despise the representative system and professional lawmaking more than  ever.    When leaders of Social Democracy, like Bebel and Liebknecht, thought it  more expedient to adapt themselves to conditions, Most went to London,  where he continued his revolutionary literary crusade in the \"Freiheit.\"  He came in contact with Karl Marx, Engels and various other refugees who  lived in England. Marx assured Most that his sharp pen in the \"Freiheit\"  was not likely to cause him any trouble in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27137"],[0,"The Scholfield Wool-Carding Machines (#4)"],[1," fibers from the  faster moving main cylinder, carding the fibers on contact. A stripping  action takes place when the wires of the worker roller meet the points  of the stripper roller in a \"point to back\" action. This arrangement is  used to remove the wool from the worker and put it back on the wire  teeth of the main cylinder. Illustrated in W. Van Bergen and H.R.  Mauersberger, _American wool handbook_, New York, 1948, p. 451.    [4] The doffer comb, a serrated metal plate the length of the rollers,  removes the carded fibers from the last roller or doffer.    [5] This was no great disadvantage at this time, as wool was still being  spun on the spinning wheel. The mechanical spinning of woolen yarns was  an obstinate problem that was not solved until 1815-1820. It then was  necessary to piece these 24-inch slivers together before they could be  spun until 1826, when a device for the doffing of carded wool in a  continuous sliver was perfected by an American, John Goulding, and  patented by him.

Bringing neither plans nor models with him  from which to build the machines, he relied instead on his detailed  knowledge of their construction. England prohibited the export of  textile machines, models, and plans, and even attempted to prevent  skilled artisans from leaving the country. George S.
