From this point work until you have completed  the 183d row, increasing at beginning of 172d, 176th and 180th rows by  knitting in the back, then in the front of the 2d stitch. You should  then have 20 stitches on the needle. Knit one plain row (the 184th) and  bind off.    Right front: Begin like left front, doing 12 plain rows.    13. Knit 10, * knit 2, purl 2, repeat from * to end, knitting last  stitch.    14. Knit 2, purl 2, repeat until 11 stitches remain, purl 1, knit 10.  Repeat last two rows until you have 27 rows in all.    28. Knit as usual until you have the 10 border stitches remaining, knit  3, bind off 3, knit 4.    29. Knit 4, cast on 3, knit 3, and continue as usual. This forms the  buttonhole. Make five buttonholes at equal distances apart, and begin  the narrowing for collar in the 11th row, continuing like left front.    Back: Cast on 79 stitches and knit 12 rows plain; then work in the  pattern until you have 120 rows in all, which brings the work to the  armhole.    121. Bind off 2 stitches and knit remainder as usual, taking care to  keep the pattern. Repeat this row seven times, when you will have taken  8 stitches from each side. Knit 48 rows in pattern on the remaining 63  stitches.    177, 178. Knit in pattern until within 7 stitches of the end; turn,  leaving these stitches on left-hand needle without knitting.    179, 180. Knit in pattern to within 13 stitches of the end (including  the 7 stitches previously left), turn.    181, 182. Knit in pattern to within 19 stitches of end, turn.    183. Knit 4, narrow, (knit 5, narrow) twice, knit rest plain, to end of  needle.    184. Knit plain entirely across, and bind off.    Sleeves. Cast on 97 stitches.    1.

Continue to knit in pattern, decreasing at beginning and end of  every 8th row until 73 stitches remain, then knit without decreasing  until you have 120 rows, counting from the 15th row.    Take the smaller needles and commence the cuff on the sleeve-stitches as  follows: Slip 1, (narrow, knit 2) 3 times, (narrow, knit 1) 14 times,  narrow, knit 2, to end of row.    Repeat last 3 rows until you end with 2 stitches and bind off.    Pockets.--With the larger needles cast on 23 stitches.    1. Knit 1, * knit 2, purl 2, repeat from * across, ending with knit 2.    2. Slip 1, * purl 2, knit 2, repeat, ending with purl 1, knit 1.    3. Slip 1, * knit 2, purl 2, repeat, ending with knit 2.    Repeat last two rows until you have 32 rows in pattern, then knit 10  rows plain for top of pocket and bind off.    To make up the coat, first press the border of fronts; stretch into  shape, pin to an ironing-board, cover with a damp cloth and press with a  fairly hot iron until the cloth is dry. This will prevent the coat from  drawing up, as the ribs are inclined to do. For sewing, use a  blunt-pointed needle to avoid splitting the wool. Sew up the side and  shoulder-seams, taking a stitch from each edge and keeping the edges  perfectly even, being careful not to draw the sewing-yarn so tightly as  to pucker the seam in the least. Sew up the sleeves, and place the  sleeve-seam an inch to the front of the side-seam, easing in any fulness  there is around the top. Place the center of collar at center of back  before sewing on; this must be done on right side of coat, and the  collar turned over. Sew on the pockets, matching the ridges, and sew on  five pearl or bone buttons, about three-fourths of an inch in diameter,  to correspond with the buttonholes, placing a small pearl button at the  back of the larger one on wrong side of coat and sewing through both  together.    This coat measures twenty-six inches from shoulder to hem. It may easily  be made longer, if desired, but the model is an excellent one for  ordinary wear, and very \"natty,\" and it has the merit of being quickly  knitted.    As has been suggested, a good way to do, when knitting a sweater in any  stitch, is to have a pattern and work to fit that. First, have a coat  cut from any old cloth, and of any style desired. Seam it up and try it  on, having it fitted nicely, then cut along the seam and take apart.  Fasten the different parts on a smooth surface by means of thumbtacks  and knit to measure, without stretching your work.          Ladies' Sweater      [Illustration: Ladies' Sweater]    This sweater requires five skeins of knitting-worsted, and four balls of  Angora; electric blue for the body of the garment, and gray Angora were  combined in the model, but other colors may be chosen at pleasure. The  work is done in plain knitting, back and forth, with ribbed belt. With  the knitting-worsted and No. 5 needles, cast on 119 stitches for the  back, which will measure about twenty-four inches, and knit 48 ribs, or  96 rows. Next row, * narrow, knit 4; repeat from *. Then change to No.  12 steel needles and do 20 rows in triple rib (knit 3, purl 3) for the  belt. Change to No. 5 needles and knit 20 ribs; then decrease 1 stitch  at end of needle every other row five times. Knit 29 ribs plain, or  without decreasing. Next row, knit 34 stitches, slip them on to a spare  needle, bind off 21 stitches for neck, and on the remaining 34 stitches,  knit 4 ribs; then cast on 30 stitches at the neck, knit 29 ribs,  increase 1 stitch at armhole every other row five times, and knit 22  ribs plain. Change to the steel needles, and work the belt as directed  for the back, (purl 3, knit 3,) starting from front edge. Having  completed the belt--20 rows of triple rib--change to No. 5 needles; *  knit 4, increase 1 stitch, repeat from *. Then knit 48 ribs and bind off  on the wrong side. Knit the other front to correspond, omitting  buttonholes if these are used.    For the sleeve: Working on right side of sweater, pick up 1 stitch on  each rib around the armhole, 72 stitches in all; knit 8 ribs, then  decrease 1 stitch at each end of needle every 8th rib, eight times.  Change to steel needles and knit 12 ribs for the wrist; change to the  larger (No. 5) needles, * knit 4, narrow; repeat across, then knit 12  ribs, join the Angora, knit 7 ribs, and bind off.    Collar: Using No. 5 needles and the knitting-worsted, cast on 65  stitches; knit 28 ribs. Join the Angora wool, knit 11 rows, increasing 1  stitch at each end of needle every other row, and bind off. Working on  right side of collar pick up 1 stitch on each rib at the side, knit 11  rows, increasing 1 stitch every other row toward the corner and keeping  the neck edge even, and bind off. Make the other side of collar to  correspond and sew up the mitered corners. The border of Angora wool may  be as much wider as one chooses to make it by adding more rows or ribs.    Two large buttons covered with the knitting-worsted--either knitted or  crocheted--and furnished with a loop sewed on each side, are used to  fasten the belt.    For the buttons: Using a bone hook which will carry the yarn, make a  chain of 3 stitches, turn, and in 2d stitch of chain make 8 doubles; in  next round make 2 doubles in each stitch, working in both veins so there  will be no rib; then make 1 double in 1st stitch, 2 in next, and repeat.  Continue to work around and around until you have a circle which will  cover the button-mold--5 rounds in all were required for top of buttons  used on model, work around without widening, slip in the mold, then *  miss 1, a double in next, and repeat until the cover is closed. If  preferred, knit a tiny square as you did the body of the garment; and  use this to cover the mold, drawing it snugly over, and fastening  underneath. For the loop, make a chain of 30 stitches, turn and make a  double in each stitch; fasten securely beneath the button.          Ladies' Knitted Gloves with Fancy Backs      [Illustration: Ladies' Knitted Gloves with Fancy Backs]    Use No. 16 steel needles, with Spanish knitting-yarn or worsted. Cast on  57 stitches.    1. Purl 2, slip and bind, (over, knit 1) 5 times, over, narrow, purl 2,  knit 6; repeat twice.    2. Purl 2, knit 13, purl 2, knit 6; repeat.    3. Purl 2, slip and bind, knit 9, narrow, purl 2, knit 6; repeat.    4. Purl 2, slip and bind, knit 7, narrow, purl 2, knit 6; repeat.    5. Same as 4th row.    6. Purl 2, slip and bind, (over, knit 1) 5 times, over, narrow, purl 2,  take 3 of the 6 stitches off on a separate needle, hold this at back of  work, knit next 3 stitches, then knit the 3 on separate needle; repeat.    Continue in pattern, twisting the \"cable\" as directed every 6th row,  until the wrist is seven patterns in length. Then carry one cable up  back of hand, with an openwork stripe each side, and knit plain across  palm.    Commence thumb at top of wrist. As the gloves are right and left, care  must be taken in starting the thumb so that both will not be for the  same hand.

The senate decreed them public thanks,  ordered the men to give place to them upon all occasions, caused an  altar to be erected for them on the spot where the mother had softened  her son, and the wife her husband; and the sex were permitted to add  another ornament to their head-dress.    The Roman women saved the city a second time, when besieged by Brennus.  They gave up all their gold as its ransom. For that instance of their  generosity, the senate granted them the honor of having funeral orations  pronounced in the rostrum, in common with patriots and heroes.    After the battle of Cannae, when Rome had no other treasures but the  virtues of her citizens, the women sacrificed both their jewels and  their gold. A new decree rewarded their zeal.    Valerius Maximus who lived in the reign of Tiberius, informs us that, in  the second triumvirate, the three assassins who governed Rome thirsting  after gold, no less than blood, and having already practised every  species of robbery, and worn out every method of plunder; resolved _to  tax the women_. They imposed a heavy contribution upon each of them. The  women sought an orator to defend their cause, but found none. Nobody  would reason against those who had the power of life and death. The  daughter of the celebrated Hortensius alone appeared. She revived the  memory of her father's abilities, and supported with intrepidity her own  cause and that of her sex. The ruffians blushed and revoked their  orders.    Hortensia was conducted home in triumph, and had the honor of having  given, in one day, an example of courage to men, a pattern of eloquence  to women, and a lesson of humanity to tyrants.    During upwards of six hundred years, the _virtues_ had been found  sufficient to please. They now found it necessary to call in the  _accomplishments_. They were desirous to join admiration to esteem,  'till they learned to exceed esteem itself. For in all countries, in  proportion as the love of virtue diminishes, we find the love of talents  to increase.    A thousand causes concurred to produce this revolution of manners among  the Romans. The vast inequality of ranks, the enormous fortunes of  individuals, the ridicule, affixed by the imperial court to moral ideas,  all contributed to hasten the period of corruption.    There were still, however, some great and virtuous characters among the  Roman women. Portia, the daughter of Cato, and wife of Brutus, showed  herself worthy to be associated with the first of human kind, and  trusted with the fate of empires. After the battle of Phillippi, she  would neither survive liberty nor Brutus, but died with the bold  intrepidity of Cato.    The example of Portia was followed by that of Arria, who seeing her  husband hesitating and afraid to die, in order to encourage him, pierced  her own breast, and delivered to him the dagger with a smile.    Paulinia too, the wife of Seneca, caused her veins to be opened at the  same time with her husband's, but being forced to live, during the few  years which she survived him, \"she bore in her countenance,\" says  Tacitus, \"the honorable testimony of her love, a _paleness_, which  proved that part of her blood had sympathetically issued with the blood  of her spouse.\"    To take notice of all the celebrated women of the empire, would much  exceed the bounds of the present undertaking. But the empress Julia the  wife of Septimius Severus, possessed a species of merit so very  different from any of those already mentioned, as to claim particular  attention.    This lady was born in Syria, and a daughter of a priest of the sun. It  was predicted that she would rise to sovereign dignity; and her  character justified the prophecy.    Julia, while on the throne, loved, or pretended passionately to love,  letters. Either from taste, from a desire to instruct herself, from a  love of renown, or possibly from all these together, she spent her life  with philosophers. Her rank of empress would not, perhaps, have been  sufficient to subdue those bold spirits; but she joined to that the more  powerful influences of wit and beauty. These three kinds of empire  rendered less necessary to her that which consists only in art; and  which, attentive to their tastes and their weaknesses, govern great  minds by little means.    It is said she was a philosopher. Her philosophy, however, did not  extend so far as to give chastity to her manners. Her husband, who did  not love her, valued her understanding so much, that he consulted her  upon all occasions. She governed in the same manner under his son.    Julia was, in short, an empress and a politician, occupied at the same  time about literature, and affairs of state, while she mingled her  pleasures freely with both. She had courtiers for her lovers, scholars  for her friends, and philosophers for her counsellors. In the midst of a  society, where she reigned and was instructed. Julia arrived at the  highest celebrity; but as among all her excellencies, we find not those  of her sex, the virtues of a woman, our admiration is lost in blame. In  her life time she obtained more praise than respect; and posterity,  while it has done justice to her talents and her accomplishments, has  agreed to deny her esteem.      LAWS AND CUSTOMS RESPECTING THE ROMAN WOMEN.    The Roman women, as well as the Grecian, were under perpetual  guardianship; and were not at any age, nor in any condition, ever  trusted with the management of their own fortunes.    Every father had power of life and death over his own daughters: but  this power was not restricted to daughters only; it extended also to  sons.    The Oppian law prohibited women from having more than half an ounce of  gold employed in ornamenting their persons, from wearing clothes of  divers colors, and from riding in chariots, either in the city, or a  thousand paces round it.    They were strictly forbid to use wine, or even to have in their  possession the key of any place where it was kept. For either of these  faults they were liable to be divorced by their husbands. So careful  were the Romans in restraining their women from wine, that they are  supposed to have first introduced the custom of saluting their female  relations and acquaintances, on entering the house of a friend or  neighbor, that they might discover by their breath, whether they had  tasted any of that liquor.    This strictness, however, began in time to be relaxed; until at last,  luxury becoming too strong for every law, the women indulged themselves  in equal liberties with the men.    But such was not the case in the earlier ages of Rome. Romulus even  permitted husbands to kill their wives, if they found them drinking  wine.    Fabius Pictor relates, that the parents of a Roman lady, having detected  her picking the lock of a chest which contained some wine, shut her up  and starved her to death.    Women were liable to be divorced by their husbands almost at pleasure,  provided the portion was returned which they had brought along with  them. They were also liable to be divorced for barrenness, which, if it  could be construed into a fault, was at least the fault of nature, and  might sometimes be that of the husband.    A few sumptuary laws, a subordination to the men, and a total want of  authority, do not so much affect the sex, as to be coldly and  indelicately treated by their husbands.    Such a treatment is touching them in the tenderest part. Such, however  we have reason to believe, they often met with from the Romans, who had  not learned, as in modern times to blend the rigidity of the patriot,  and roughness of the warrior, with that soft and indulging behavior, so  conspicuous in our modern patriots and heroes.    Husbands among the Romans not only themselves behaved roughly to their  wives, but even sometimes permitted their servants and slaves to do the  same. The principal eunuch of Justinian the Second, threatened to  chastise the Empress, his master's wife, in the manner that children are  chastised at school, if she did not obey his orders.    With regard to the private diversions of the Roman ladies, history is  silent. Their public ones, were such as were common to both sexes; as  bathing, theatrical representations, horse-races, shows of wild beasts,  which fought against one another, and sometimes against men, whom the  emperors, in the plenitude of their despotic power, ordered to engage  them.    The Romans, of both sexes, spent a great deal of time at the baths;  which at first, perhaps, were interwoven with their religion, but at  last were only considered as refinements in luxury. They were places of  public resort, where people met with their acquaintances and friends,  where public libraries were kept for such as chose to read, and where  poets recited their works to such as had patience to hear.    In the earlier periods of Rome, separate baths were appropriated to each  sex. Luxury, by degrees getting the better of decency, the men and women  at last bathed promiscuously together. Though this indecent manner of  bathing was prohibited by the emperor Adrian; yet, in a short time,  inclination overcame the prohibition; and, in spite of every effort,  promiscuous bathing continued until the time of Constantine, who, by the  coercive force of the legislative authority, and the rewards and  terrors of the Christian religion, put a final stop to it.      WOMAN IN SAVAGE LIFE.    Man, in a state of barbarity, equally cruel and indolent, active by  necessity, but naturally inclined to repose, is acquainted with little  more than the physical effects of love; and having none of those moral  ideas which only can soften the empire of force, he is led to consider  it as his supreme law, subjecting to his despotism those whom reason had  made his equals,"]]]
