I never feel that I am truly back on the open range till  I hear their call and see the Prairie-dogs once more upon their mounds.  As you travel up the Yellowstone Valley from Livingstone to Gardiner you  may note in abundance this \"dunce of the plains.\" The \"dog-towns\" are  frequent along the railway, and at each of the many burrows you see from  one to six of the inmates. As you come near Gardiner there is a steady  rise of the country, and somewhere near the edge of the Park the  elevation is such that it imposes one of those mysterious barriers to  animal extension which seem to be as impassable as they are invisible.  The Prairie-dog range ends near the Park gates. General George S.  Anderson tells me, however, that individuals are occasionally found on  the flats along the Gardiner River, but always near the gate, and never  elsewhere in the Park. On this basis, then, the Prairie-dog is entered  as a Park animal.    [Illustration]    It is, of course, a kind of Ground-squirrel. The absurd name \"dog\"  having been given on account of its \"bark.\" This call is a high-pitched  \"yek-yek-yek-yeeh,\" uttered as an alarm cry while the creature sits up  on the mound by its den, and every time it \"yeks\" it jerks up its tail.  Old timers will tell you that the Prairie-dog's voice is tied to its  tail, and prove it by pointing out that one is never raised without the  other.    As we have seen, the Coyote looks on the dog-town much as a cow does on  a field of turnips or alfalfa--a very proper place, to seek for  wholesome, if commonplace, sustenance. But Coyotes are not the only  troubles in the life of Yek-yek.    Ancient books and interesting guides will regale the traveller with most  acceptable stories about the Prairie-dog, Rattlesnake, and the Burrowing  Owl, all living in the same den on a basis of brotherly love and  Christian charity; having effected, it would seem, a limited partnership  and a most satisfactory division of labour: the Prairie-dog is to dig  the hole, the Owl to mount sentry and give warning of all danger, and  the Rattler is to be ready to die at his post as defender of the  Prairie-dog's young. This is pleasing if true.    There can be no doubt that at times all three live in the same burrow,  and in dens that the hard-working rodent first made. But the simple fact  is that the Owl and the Snake merely use the holes abandoned (perhaps  under pressure) by the Prairie-dog; and if any two of the three  underground worthies happen to meet in the same hole, the fittest  survives. I suspect further that the young of each kind are fair game  and acceptable, dainty diet to each of the other two.    [Illustration]    Farmers consider Prairie-dogs a great nuisance; the damage they do to  crops is estimated at millions per annum. The best way to get rid of  them, practically the only way, is by putting poison down each and every  hole in the town, which medieval Italian mode has become the accepted  method in the West.    Poor helpless little Yek-yek, he has no friends; his enemies and his  list of burdens increase. The prey of everything that preys, he yet  seems incapable of any measure of retaliation. The only visible joy in  his life is his daily hasty meal of unsucculent grass, gathered between  cautious looks around for any new approaching trouble, and broken by so  many dodges down the narrow hole that his ears are worn off close to his  head. Could any simpler, smaller pleasure than his be discovered? Yet he  is fat and merry; undoubtedly he enjoys his every day on earth, and is  as unwilling as any of us to end the tale. We can explain him only if we  credit him with a philosophic power to discover happiness within in  spite of all the cold unfriendly world about him.      THE WHISTLER IN THE ROCKS    [Illustration]    When the far-off squirrel ancestor of Yek-yek took to the plains for a  range, another of the family selected the rocky hills.    He developed bigger claws for the harder digging, redder colour for the  red-orange surroundings, and a far louder and longer cry for signalling  across the peaks and canyons, and so became the bigger, handsomer, more  important creature we call the Mountain Whistler, Yellow Marmot or  Orange Woodchuck.    In all of the rugged mountain parts of the Yellowstone one may hear his  peculiar, shrill whistle, especially in the warm mornings.    [Illustration]    You carefully locate the direction of the note and proceed to climb  toward it. You may have an hour's hard work before you sight the  orange-breasted Whistler among the tumbled mass of rocks that surround  his home, for it is a far-reaching sound, heard half a mile away at  times.    Those who know the Groundhog of the East would recognize in the Rock  Woodchuck its Western cousin, a little bigger, yellower, and brighter in  its colours, living in the rocks and blessed with a whistle that would  fill a small boy with envy. Now, lest the critical should object to the  combination name of \"Rock Woodchuck,\" it is well to remind them that  \"Woodchuck\" has nothing to do with either \"wood\" or \"chucking,\" but is  our corrupted form of an Indian name \"Ot-choeck,\" which is sometimes  written also \"We-jack.\"    In the ridge of broken rocks just back of Yancey's is a colony of the  Whistlers; and there as I sat sketching one day, with my camera at hand,  one poked his head up near me and gave me the pose that is seen in the  photograph.      THE PACK-RAT AND HIS MUSEUM    Among my school fellows was a boy named Waddy who had a mania for  collecting odds, ends, curios, bits of brass or china, shiny things,  pebbles, fungus, old prints, bones, business cards, carved peach stones,  twisted roots, distorted marbles, or freak buttons. Anything odd or  glittering was his especial joy. He had no theory about these things.  He did not do anything in particular with them. He found gratification  in spreading them out to gloat over, but I think his chief joy was in  the collecting. And when some comrade was found possessed of a novelty  that stirred his cupidity, the pleasure of planning a campaign to secure  possession, the working out of the details, and the glory of success,  were more to Waddy than any other form of riches or exploit.    [Illustration]    The Pack-rat is the Waddy of the mountains, or Waddy was the Pack-rat of  the school. Imagine, if you would picture the Pack-rat, a small creature  like a common rat, but with soft fur, a bushy tail, and soulful eyes,  living the life of an ordinary rat in the woods, except that it has an  extraordinary mania for collecting curios.    There can be little doubt that this began in the nest-building idea, and  then, because it was necessary to protect his home, cactus leaves and  thorny branches were piled on it. The instinct grew until to-day the  nest of a Pack-rat is a mass of rubbish from one to four feet high, and  four to eight feet across. I have examined many of these collections.  They are usually around the trunks in a clump of low trees, and consist  of a small central nest about eight inches across, warm and soft, with a  great mass of sticks and thorns around and over this, leaving a narrow  entrance well-guarded by an array of cactus spines; then on top of all,  a most wonderful collection of pine cones, shells, pebbles, bones,  scraps of paper and tin, and the skulls of other animals. And when the  owner can add to these works of art or vertu a brass cartridge, a buckle  or a copper rivet, his little bosom is doubtless filled with the same  high joy that any great collector might feel on securing a Raphael or a  Rembrandt.    I remember finding an old pipe in one Rat museum. Pistol cartridges are  eagerly sought after, so are saddle buckles, even if he has to cut them  surreptitiously from the saddle of some camper. And when any of these  articles are found missing it is usual to seek out the nearest Rat  house, and here commonly the stolen goods are discovered shamelessly  exposed on top. I remember hearing of a set of false teeth that were  lost in camp, but rescued in this very way.      A FREE TRADER    \"Pack\" is a Western word meaning \"carry,\" and thus the Rat that carries  off things is the \"Pack-rat.\" But it has another peculiarity. As though  it had a conscience disturbed by pilfering the treasure of another, it  often brings back what may be considered a fair exchange. Thus a  silver-plated spoon may have gone from its associate cup one night, but  in that cup you may find a long pine cone or a surplus nail, by which  token you may know that a Pack-rat has called and collected. Sometimes  this enthusiastic fancier goes off with food, but leaves something in  its place; in one case that I heard of, the Rat, either with a sense of  humour or a mistaken idea of food values, after having carried off the  camp biscuit, had filled the vacant dish with the round pellets known as  \"Elk sign.\" But evidently there is a disposition to deal fair; not to  steal, but to trade. For this reason the creature is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27901"],[0,"Jewish Literature and Other Essays (#4)"],[1,".--Who can  like him with mighty speech appall?--Compared with him the poets of his  time are without power--he, the small, alone is a tower.--The highest  round of poetry's ladder has he won.--Wisdom fondled him, eloquence hath  called him son--and clothing him with purple, said: 'Lo!--my first-born  son, go forth, to conquest go!'--His predecessors' songs are naught with  his compared--nor have his many followers better fared.--The later  singers by him were taught--the heirs they are of his poetic  thought.--But still he's king, to him all praise belongs--for Solomon's  is the Song of Songs.\"    By Gabirol's side stands Yehuda Halevi, probably the only Jewish poet  known to the reader of general literature, to whom his name, life, and  fate have become familiar through Heinrich Heine's _Romanzero_. His  magnificent descriptions of nature \"reflect southern skies, verdant  meadows, deep blue rivers, and the stormy sea,\" and his erotic lyrics  are chaste and tender. He sounds the praise of wine, youth, and  happiness, and extols the charms of his lady-love, but above and beyond  all he devotes his song to Zion and his people. The pearl of his poems        \"Is the famous lamentation      Sung in all the tents of Jacob,      Scattered wide upon the earth ...        Yea, it is the song of Zion,      Which Yehuda ben Halevy,      Dying on the holy ruins,      Sang of loved Jerusalem.\"[8]    \"In the whole compass of religious poetry, Milton's and Klopstock's not  excepted, nothing can be found to surpass the elegy of Zion,\" says a  modern writer, a non-Jew.[9] This soul-stirring \"Lay of Zion,\" better  than any number of critical dissertations, will give the reader a clear  insight into the character and spirit of Jewish poetry in general:        O Zion! of thine exiles' peace take thought,      The remnant of thy flock, who thine have sought!      From west, from east, from north and south resounds,      Afar and now anear, from all thy bounds,                And no surcease,                \"With thee be peace!\"        In longing's fetters chained I greet thee, too,      My tears fast welling forth like Hermon's dew--      O bliss could they but drop on holy hills!      A croaking bird I turn, when through me thrills      Thy desolate state; but when I dream anon,      The Lord brings back thy ev'ry captive son--                A harp straightway                To sing thy lay.        In heart I dwell where once thy purest son      At Bethel and Peniel, triumphs won;      God's awesome presence there was close to thee,      Whose doors thy Maker, by divine decree,            Opposed as mates            To heaven's gates.        Nor sun, nor moon, nor stars had need to be;      God's countenance alone illumined thee      On whose elect He poured his spirit out.      In thee would I my soul pour forth devout!      Thou wert the kingdom's seat, of God the throne,      And now there dwells a slave race, not thine own,            In royal state,            Where reigned thy great.        O would that I could roam o'er ev'ry place      Where God to missioned prophets showed His grace!      And who will give me wings? An off'ring meet,      I'd haste to lay upon thy shattered seat,            Thy counterpart--            My bruised heart.        Upon thy precious ground I'd fall prostrate,      Thy stones caress, the dust within thy gate,      And happiness it were in awe to stand      At Hebron's graves, the treasures of thy land,      And greet thy woods, thy vine-clad slopes, thy vales,      Greet Abarim and Hor, whose light ne'er pales,            A radiant crown,            Thy priests' renown.        Thy air is balm for souls; like myrrh thy sand;      With honey run the rivers of thy land.      Though bare my feet, my heart's delight I'd count      To thread my way all o'er thy desert mount,            Where once rose tall            Thy holy hall,        Where stood thy treasure-ark, in recess dim,      Close-curtained, guarded o'er by cherubim.      My Naz'rite's crown would I pluck off, and cast      It gladly forth. With curses would I blast      The impious time thy people, diadem-crowned,      Thy Nazirites, did pass, by en'mies bound            With hatred's bands,            In unclean lands.        By dogs thy lusty lions are brutal torn      And dragged; thy strong, young eaglets, heav'nward      borne,      By foul-mouthed ravens snatched, and all undone.      Can food still tempt my taste? Can light of sun            Seem fair to shine            To eyes like mine?        Soft, soft! Leave off a while, O cup of pain!      My loins are weighted down, my heart and brain,      With bitterness from thee. Whene'er I think      Of Oholah,[10] proud northern queen, I drink      Thy wrath, and when my Oholivah forlorn      Comes back to mind--'tis then I quaff thy scorn,            Then, draught of pain,            Thy lees I drain.        O Zion! Crown of grace! Thy comeliness      Hath ever favor won and fond caress.      Thy faithful lovers' lives are bound in thine;      They joy in thy security, but pine            And weep in gloom            O'er thy sad doom.        From out the prisoner's cell they sigh for thee,      And each in prayer, wherever he may be,      Towards thy demolished portals turns. Exiled,      Dispersed from mount to hill, thy flock defiled      Hath not forgot thy sheltering fold. They grasp      Thy garment's hem, and trustful, eager, clasp,                With outstretched arms,                Thy branching palms.        Shinar, Pathros--can they in majesty      With thee compare? Or their idolatry      With thy Urim and thy Thummim august?      Who can surpass thy priests, thy saintly just,                Thy prophets bold,                And bards of old?        The heathen kingdoms change and wholly cease--      Thy might alone stands firm without decrease,      Thy Nazirites from age to age abide,      Thy God in thee desireth to reside.      Then happy he who maketh choice of thee      To dwell within thy courts, and waits to see,                And toils to make,                Thy light awake.        On him shall as the morning break thy light,      The bliss of thy elect shall glad his sight,      In thy felicities shall he rejoice,      In triumph sweet exult, with jubilant voice,                O'er thee, adored,                To youth restored.    We have loitered long with Yehuda Halevi, and still not long enough, for  we have not yet spoken of his claims to the title philosopher, won for  him by his book _Al-Chazari_. But now we must hurry on to Moses ben  Ezra, the last and most worldly of the three great poets. He devotes his  genius to his patrons, to wine, his faithless mistress, and to  \"bacchanalian feasts under leafy canopies, with merry minstrelsy of  birds.\" He laments over separation from friends and kin, weeps over the  shortness of life and the rapid approach of hoary age--all in polished  language, sometimes, however, lacking euphony. Even when he strikes his  lyre in praise and honor of his people Israel, he fails to rise to the  lofty heights attained by his mates in song.    With Yehuda Charisi, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, the  period of the epigones sets in for Spanish-Jewish literature. In  Charisi's _Tachkemoni_, an imitation of the poetry of the Arab Hariri,  jest and serious criticism, joy and grief, the sublime and the trivial,  follow each other like tints in a parti-colored skein. His distinction  is the ease with which he plays upon the Hebrew language, not the most  pliable of instruments. In general, Jewish poets and philosophers have  manipulated that language with surprising dexterity. Songs, hymns,  elegies, penitential prayers, exhortations, and religious meditations,  generation after generation, were couched in the idiom of the psalmist,  yet the structure of the language underwent no change. \"The development  of the neo-Hebraic idiom from the ancient Hebrew,\" a distinguished  modern ethnographer justly says, \"confirms, by linguistic evidence, the  plasticity, the logical acumen, the comprehensive and at the same time  versatile intellectuality of the Jewish race. By the ingenious  compounding of words, by investing old expressions with new meanings,  and adapting the material offered by alien or related languages to its  own purposes, it has increased and enriched a comparatively meagre  treasury of words.\"[11]    Side by side with this cosmopolitanism, illustrated in the Haggada,  whose pages prove that nothing human is strange to the Jewish race, it  reveals, in its literary development, as notably in the Halacha, a  sharply defined subjectivity. Jellinek says: \"Not losing itself in the  contemplation of the phenomena of life, not devoting itself to any  subject unless it be with an ulterior purpose, but seeing all things in  their relation to itself, and subordinating them to its own boldly  asserted _ego_, the Jewish race is not inclined to apply its powers to  the solution of intricate philosophic problems, or to abstruse  metaphysical speculations. It is, therefore, not a philosophic race, and  its participation in the philosophic work of the world dates only from  its contact with the Greeks.\" The same author, on the other hand,  emphasizes the liberality, the broad sympathies, of the Jewish race, in  his statement that the Jewish mind, at its first meeting with Arabic  philosophy, absorbed it as a leaven into its intellectual life. The  product of the assimilation was--as early as the twelfth century, mark  you--a philosophic conception of life, whose broad liberality culminates  in the sentiment expressed by two most eminent thinkers: Christianity  and Islam are the precursors of a world-religion, the preliminary  conditions for the great religious system satisfying all men. Yehuda  Halevi and Moses Maimonides were the philosophers bold enough to utter  this thought of far-reaching significance.    The"]]]
