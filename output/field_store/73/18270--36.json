CASE XIII.    ---- Ferreira, aged seventeen months, died of '_Water in the  head_,'--_suckled until its death_.    For the five following cases I am indebted to the kindness of Mr.  William Griffith, an intelligent surgeon of Eaton-street, who, having  some time ago been apprised of my peculiar views, has since directed his  attention particularly to the subject. They completely confirm my  opinions, and will have more weight with the public than any additional  evidence I could adduce from my own practice.    In the letter inclosing these cases, Mr. Griffith writes thus--'from the  observations I have been enabled to make, I am led to believe that  disease almost invariably follows protracted suckling. I may add in  conclusion, that I perfectly concur with the views which you entertain  on the subject.'      CASES XIV. XV.    '---- Jackson, residing at ----, aged two years six months, who had been  kept _at the breast twenty-two months_, was in a dying state when I was  requested to see her. The pulse was preternaturally slow--great  stupor--dilatation of the pupils, and diastasis of the bones of the  head. In six hours from the time I first saw her she died, and the  mother was desirous that the head should be examined, having lost a  child previously, in what she considered a similar manner. On removing  the scalp I found the cranium very much enlarged and altered in shape.  Between the tunica arachnoides and pia mater, there was a quantity of  water effused;--the sides and upper surface of the brain were  exceedingly soft. In the lateral ventricles there were from six to eight  ounces of water. In answer to a few questions I asked the mother, she  stated that her former child was, during the _first ten months_ of its  life, _a plump, healthy infant_,--_after that period he altered_,--the  stomach, bowels, and _head became affected_, and, in the course of a few  months, he manifested similar symptoms to those which proved fatal in  the case of his sister. He was _suckled for twenty-one months_, and  _died_ at the age of _twenty-seven months_. The mother of these children  has one other child alive, and at my urgent request it was weaned at  _nine months_,--it is now _seventeen months old, and in excellent  health_.'      CASE XVI.    'Mrs. A----, of ----, had a little boy who at _ten months old_ had nine  teeth, which were cut with little or no difficulty:--_at this time he  was in good health_,--_he was allowed the breast until nineteen months,  and at the expiration of three months more, died of Hydrocephalus_.'      CASE XVII.    'Mrs. T---- lost a child of Hydrocephalus, and has an infant _now at the  breast seventeen months old_;--the little patient is frequently  suffering from _cerebral disturbance_. I have repeatedly advised the  mother to wean it--she objects, and gives the usual reason for allowing  it to remain at the breast--viz., that she does it to _prevent becoming  again enceinte_.'      CASE XVIII.    'This day, (August 13, 1831,) a little child labouring under _cerebral  disease_ was brought to me for advice, and he appeared certainly in a  most pitiable state; he is _two years four months old_ and is _now at  the breast_,--I do not think it possible for him to survive many days.'

The mother of the last mentioned child lost three previously, with  '_water in the head_:'--all these were suckled _more than eighteen  months_.      CASE XXIX.

CASE XXXIV.    Robert Selkirk, aged three years six months; admitted for  _Meningitis_--_suckled thirteen months_.      CASE XXXV.    The mother of the preceding child lost another of '_inflammation of the  brain_.'--This was _suckled more than one year_.      CASE XXXVI.

Sarah Ward, aged three years; admitted for Hooping-cough--_head much  affected_--_suckled one year and ten months_.      CASE XXXIX.    Thomas Donovan, aged two years two months; admitted for Hooping-cough,  with _an affection of the head_--_suckled twelve months_.      CASE XL.    Count ---- ----, aged about two years, came under my care, being then at  the breast. The head was large, fontanelle open--superficial veins more  apparent than natural. By my advice he was directly weaned, and rapidly  improved in health and appearance (the only medicine given being  occasional doses of castor oil). About twelve months afterwards, in  consequence of an imprudent exposure to cold, he was attacked with  Bronchitis, and Meningitis supervened. Leeches were applied to the head,  and other depletory measures actively employed, which were followed by  recovery.      CASE XLI.    ---- Sloggat, aged thirteen months, died of _Meningitis_ supervening  upon Pneumonia--_suckled until the time of its death_.      CASE XLII.    John Scott, aged eleven months; admitted for Hooping-cough, with a  _well-marked affection of the head_--_still at the breast_.      CASE XLIII.    ---- Scott, aged fifteen months,--died of 'Hooping-cough, with  convulsions,' _being then at the breast_.      CASE XLIV.    Isaac Berwick, aged one year two months, admitted for Hooping-cough,  _with an affection of the head_--_still at the breast_.      CASE XLV.    Frederick Cousins, aged three years four months, brought to me labouring  under Hooping-cough, with Meningitis, which latter terminated in  effusion. Calomel was then given every two hours, the stronger mercurial  ointment rubbed upon the temples, and blisters applied to the head. The  mercurial influence being established, a profuse discharge of urine  occurred; the pupils which had previously been _permanently_ dilated,  became once more obedient to light; sensibility was restored, and great  weakness appeared to be the only urgent symptom. The cough, however, now  returned, the head became again affected, and the child sunk. Upon  opening the head, about four ounces of fluid was found in the  ventricles[K]. This child was _suckled sixteen months_.      CASE XLVI.    Sarah Swann, aged four years six months, admitted for Hooping-cough with  convulsions,--_suckled one year_.      CASE XLVII.    Henry Harris, aged two years three months, admitted for Hooping-cough,  _with an affection_ of the head,--_suckled one year four months_.      CASE XLVIII.    Maria Hughes, aged two years, admitted for _Convulsions_ supervening  upon Hooping-cough--_suckled one year three months_.      CASE XLIX.    Thomas Benson, aged one year six months, admitted for Pneumonia, with  _well-marked affection of the head_--_suckled one year four months_.      CASE L.    Mary Kenner, aged six years, admitted for Hooping-cough, with  _well-marked affection of the head_--_suckled one year six months_.      CASE LI.    John Ennis, aged one year seven months, admitted for Bronchitis, to  which _a decided affection of the head succeeded_--_suckled one year_.      IV.    _Case of Meningitis produced in consequence "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#4)"],[1,"applied to Louis  XVIII. by the people.    Hitherto the government appeared to adhere to the resolution of  dealing out impartial justice to both parties, and of performing the  covenant which the new monarch had entered into with the nation. But  now he was bound by an influence which he could not withstand.  Ensnared by the machinations, the threats, and the fears of his  emigrant court, and perhaps believing that the new order of things was  incompatible with the stability of the Bourbon dynasty, the maxims of  his government underwent a total change. He was taught to consider the  equality of civil rights as a revolutionary conquest, the liberties of  the nation as an usurpation of the authority of the throne, the new  constitution as insulting the independence of the sovereign. It was  therefore determined that all \"dangerous characters[5]\" should be led  quietly out of all civil and military offices. The old trustworthy  nobility of the old kingdom were again to become the sole depositaries  of the power of the state: and by slow but sure degrees it was  resolved to cancel the royal charter, and either by fair means or by  foul, to place the nation again beneath the yoke of absolute power.                       [Footnote 5: This expression was one of those of                     which the ministers made the worst use. If they                     were told that any magistrate, any officer, any                     functionary, whom they had turned out, had                     fulfilled his duties with honour and distinction,                     that he was loved and regretted by the people, they                     answered, \"he is a dangerous character,\" and there                     was an end of the business.]    The government often appealed to the authority of the King's  predecessor on the throne--of Bonaparte. Bonaparte, it was said, had  acknowledged that it was dangerous to concede a representative  government to the people, and that it was fit and proper to rule them  despotically. But Napoleon, he who re-established the authority of  royalty, morality, and religion--who had re-organized society--who had  given tranquillity to France, at the same time that he rendered her  formidable to the world--he had earned his authority by his services  and his victories, and, if I may venture to use the expression, he had  acquired a legitimate right of despotism, which neither belonged, nor  could belong, to a Bourbon. Besides which, in spite of the real or  pretended despotism of the imperial government, it was still a  national government; a character wholly foreign to the Bourbon  government, and which it had no tendency to acquire.    The prognostics of the re-action which the ministers intended to bring  about were disclosed in all parts of the body politic. Alarm seized  even the Chamber of Deputies: it hastened to become the organ of the  uneasiness of the people, and to remind the King of the warranty which  he had given to the nation.    In the address, or rather in the protest presented by the chamber on  the 15th of June, the national representatives say, \"The charter  secures to the voice of truth every channel which leads to the throne,  since it consecrates the liberty of the press, and the right of  petition.    \"Amongst the guarantees which it contains, the nation will attend to  that which insures the responsibility of any minister who may betray  the confidence reposed in him by your Majesty, by trespassing on the  public or private rights insured by the constitutional charter.    \"By virtue of this charter, nobility in all future times will only  command the respect of the people as surrounded by proofs of honour  and glory, which the recollections of feudality will not have the  power of tarnishing.    \"The principles of civil liberty are founded upon the independence of  judicial authority, and the retention of trial by jury, that  invaluable guarantee of all our rights.\"    If the King had known the truth, this energetic address would have  attained its end. But the truth could not reach him. At first he  intended to bestow his personal confidence upon the greater part of  the leading \"notables\" of the revolution; but by means of  remonstrances and recriminations, another party contrived to place his  good sense again under the yoke of prejudice, and he surrounded  himself with old nobility alone, with men who had refused to obey the  constitution sanctioned by Louis XVI., because it destroyed their  privileges; and who, for the same reason, had refused to acknowledge  the new constitution, against which they had even dared to protest.  His companions were so blinded, so besotted by their presumption, that  they imagined that decrees and ordinances gave them the faculty of  overturning the edifice which the nation had erected during five and  twenty years of revolution. His confidents were those alone who,  instead of wishing to reveal to their sovereign the object of the  projects of the ministry, and of the faction which had rendered the  ministry their tools, had become the accomplices of ministerial guilt,  joint conspirators in the plot which was to destroy the royal charter.    The cabinet contained, however, some able and experienced statesmen.  They were convinced that instead of teasing the nation by holding out  the probability of the restoration of ancient privileges, it was the  duty of government to tranquillize the country by guaranteeing the  stability of the new system of polity. These ministers were aware of  the impolicy of attempting to re-establish the monarchy on its ancient  principles; because by such an attempt it would be deprived of the  only advantage which it possessed over the late government--that of  being liberal. And, lastly, they felt that if despotism and violence  had been the distinguishing characteristics of the government of  Napoleon, it was necessary that moderation and justice should be the  attributes of the government of a Bourbon.    But they had not sufficient authority or personal influence to enable  them to struggle against the emigrants, and the protectors of the  emigrant faction. In the council chamber their opinions, often well  concerted, and always benevolent, were sanctioned and approved. Out  of the council, each minister acted according to his own plans; and,  unfortunately, those departments which ramify most deeply into the  nation and its affairs were confided to men who seemed to think that  they were bound to irritate and sour the public mind.    General Dupont obtained the important office of minister of the war  department, as a reward due to his proscription. According to the  government party, the general had been proscribed by the Emperor. An  odious name was thus given to the lenient punishment which had been  inflicted upon Dupont, he who had shuffled off the allegiance which he  owed to his Emperor, and whose cowardice had surrendered into  captivity the legions intrusted to his command[6]. Weak, indolent,  irresolute, devoid of character and resources, he never had the wish  or the ability of becoming any thing else than the pliant functionary  of the court and the ruling courtiers.                       [Footnote 6: When Dupont capitulated to the                     Spaniards, the insurgents refused to acknowledge                     the Emperor. Dupont therefore only took the title                     of general in the French service.]    Another, the Abbe de Montesquiou, received the \"porte-feuille\" of the  home department. When a member of the Constituent Assembly he had  been honourably distinguished by his soft and persuasive eloquence.  The temperance of his public conduct seemed to be insured by his  personal character; he was a servant of the altar, his health was  delicate, he had lived long in quiet retirement. But Montesquiou,  meek, mild, and timid as long as he was in the background, became  scornful, angry, and overbearing the instant that he stepped into  power. He detested and despised the revolution--I may almost say, he  detested and despised the nation. This sentiment was the principle  which guided him. Montesquiou never deigned to inquire whether any  given portion of our polity was sound or useful, whether it had been  formed with difficulty, whether it could be modified, or ameliorated,  or fitted into existing circumstances. He only inquired into the date  of its institution--and the date decided the question.    A third, Dambray, the chancellor, and the chief law officer of the  nation, had distinguished himself in his youth as a Judge of  Parliament. His credit arose from his prudence and his principles no  less than from his talents. He had been long since recalled to his  country. During the reign of Napoleon he fulfilled the duties of a  citizen and a subject with zeal and fidelity. We never doubted but  that he would protect those constitutional forms of government under  which he had flourished in peace and honour. Scarcely, however, was  the Chancellor clothed in his robe, when he became the oppressor of  the magistracy, the antagonist of our new system of jurisprudence, and  the dull partisan of those slavish forms and barbarous customs and  oppressive edicts, which had been long since annihilated by reason,  liberty, and knowledge.    The trust reposed in this portion of the cabinet was a source of  unhappiness to the nation, but it was not the only one. Louis,  according to the promises held out on his restoration, was to reign in  person; and the more the French have ever been desirous to obey their  sovereign with cheerful alacrity, the greater is the repugnance which  they feel to submit to the orders of his minions. Dismay, therefore,  prevailed throughout the kingdom when we learnt that Louis, weakened  by an obstinate and painful disease, had entirely divested himself of  his royal authority in favour of Monsieur de Blacas. And how much more  painful did our"]]]
