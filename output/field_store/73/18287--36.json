Repeat the Antecedent in some new form, where there is any  ambiguity.* This is particularly useful after a negative: \"He said  that he would not even hear me, _which_ I confess I had expected.\"  Here the meaning may be, \"I had expected that he would,\" or \"that he  would not, hear me.\" Write, \"_a refusal_, or, _a favour_, that I  confess I had expected.\" See (38).      *11. Use particular for general terms.*--This is a most important  rule. Instead of \"I have neither the necessaries of life nor the means  of procuring them,\" write (if you can _with truth_), \"I have not a  crust of bread, nor a penny to buy one.\"    CAUTION.--There is a danger in this use. The meaning is vividly  expressed but sometimes may be exaggerated or imperfect. _Crust of  bread_ may be an exaggeration; on the other hand, if the speaker is  destitute not only of bread, but also of shelter and clothing, then  _crust of bread_ is an imperfect expression of the meaning.    In philosophy and science, where the language ought very often to be  inclusive and brief, general and not particular terms must be used.    *11 a. Avoid Verbal Nouns where Verbs can be used instead.* The  disadvantage of the use of Verbal Nouns is this, that, unless they are  immediately preceded by prepositions, they are sometimes liable to be  confounded with participles. The following is an instance of an  excessive use of Verbal Nouns:    \"The pretended confession of the secretary was only collusion to lay  the jealousies of the king's _favouring_ popery, which still hung upon  him, notwithstanding his _writing_ on the Revelation, and _affecting_  to enter on all occasions into controversy, _asserting_ in particular  that the Pope was Antichrist.\"    Write \"notwithstanding that he wrote and affected &c.\"      *12. Use a particular Person instead of a class.*    \"What is the splendour of _the greatest monarch_ compared with the  beauty of _a flower_?\" \"What is the splendour of Solomon compared with  the beauty of a daisy?\"    Under this head may come the forcible use of Noun for Adjective: \"This  fortress is _weakness_ itself.\"    An excess of this use is lengthy and pedantically bombastic, _e.g._,  the following paraphrase for \"in every British colony:\"--\"under Indian  palm-groves, amid Australian gum-trees, in the shadow of African  mimosas, and beneath Canadian pines.\"      *13. Use Metaphor instead of literal statement.*    \"The ship _ploughs_ the sea\" is clearer than \"the ship _cleaves_ the  sea,\" and shorter than \"the ship _cleaves_ the sea _as a plough  cleaves the land_.\"    Of course there are some subjects for which Metaphor should not be  used. See (14 _a_) and (14 _b_).      *14. Do not confuse Metaphor.*    \"In a moment the thunderbolt was upon them, _deluging_ their country  with invaders.\"    The following is attributed to Sir Boyle Roche: \"Mr. Speaker, I smell  a rat, I see him brewing in the air; but, mark me, I shall yet nip him  in the bud.\"    Some words, once metaphorical, have ceased to be so regarded. Hence  many good writers say \"_under_ these _circumstances_\" instead of \"_in_  these circumstances.\"    An excessive regard for disused metaphor savours of pedantry:  disregard is inelegant. Write, not, \"_unparalleled_ complications,\"  but \"_unprecedented_ complications;\" and \"_he threw light on_  obscurities,\" instead of \"_he unravelled_ obscurities.\"    *14 a. Do not introduce literal statement immediately after Metaphor.*    \"He was the father of Chemistry, and brother to the Earl of Cork.\"        \"He was a very thunderbolt of war,      And was lieutenant to the Earl of Mar.\"    *14 b. Do not use poetic metaphor to illustrate a prosaic subject.*  Thus, we may say \"a poet _soars_,\" or even, though rarely, \"a nation  _soars_ to greatness,\" but you could not say \"Consols _soared to_  94-1/2.\" Even commonplace subjects may be illustrated by metaphor: for  it is a metaphor, and quite unobjectionable, to say \"Consols  _mounted_, or _jumped_ to 94-1/2.\" But commonplace subjects must be  illustrated by metaphor that is commonplace.      ORDER OF WORDS IN A SENTENCE.    *15. Emphatic words must stand in emphatic positions; i.e. for the  most part, at the beginning or at the end of the sentence.* This rule  occasionally supersedes the common rules about position. Thus, the  place for an adverb, as a rule, should be between the subject and  verb: \"He _quickly_ left the room;\" but if _quickly_ is to be  emphatic, it must come at the beginning or end, as in \"I told him to  leave the room slowly, but he left _quickly_.\"    Adjectives, in clauses beginning with \"if\" and \"though,\" often come at  the beginning for emphasis: \"_Insolent_ though he was, he was silenced  at last.\"    *15 a. Unemphatic words must, as a rule, be kept from the end of the  sentence.* It is a common fault to break this rule by placing a short  and unemphatic predicate at the end of a long sentence.    \"To know some Latin, even if it be nothing but a few Latin roots, _is  useful_.\" Write, \"It is useful, &c.\"    So \"the evidence proves how kind to his inferiors _he is_.\"    Often, where an adjective or auxiliary verb comes at the end, the  addition of an emphatic adverb justifies the position, _e.g._ above,  \"is _very_ useful,\" \"he has _invariably_ been.\"    A short \"chippy\" ending, even though emphatic, is to be avoided. It is  abrupt and unrhythmical, _e.g._ \"The soldier, transfixed with the  spear, _writhed_.\" We want a _longer_ ending, \"fell writhing to the  ground,\" or, \"writhed in the agonies of death.\" A \"chippy\" ending is  common in bad construing from Virgil.    *Exceptions.*--Prepositions and pronouns attached to emphatic words  need not be moved from the end; _e.g._ \"He does no harm that I hear  _of_.\" \"Bear witness how I loved _him_.\"    *N.B. In all styles, especially in letter-writing, a final emphasis  must not be so frequent as to become obtrusive and monotonous.*    *15 b. An interrogation sometimes gives emphasis.* \"No one can doubt  that the prisoner, had he been really guilty, would have shown some  signs of remorse,\" is not so emphatic as \"Who can doubt, Is it  possible to doubt, &c.?\"    Contrast \"No one ever names Wentworth without thinking of &c.\" with  \"But Wentworth,--who ever names him without thinking of those harsh  dark features, ennobled by their expression into more than the majesty  of an antique Jupiter?\"      *16. The subject, if unusually emphatic, should often be removed from  the beginning of the sentence.* The beginning of the sentence is an  emphatic position, though mostly not so emphatic as the end. Therefore  the principal subject of a sentence, being emphatic, and being wanted  early in the sentence to tell us what the sentence is about, comes as  a rule, at or near the beginning: \"_Thomas_ built this house.\"    Hence, since the beginning is the _usual_ place for the subject, if we  want to emphasize \"Thomas\" _unusually_, we must remove \"Thomas\" from  the beginning: \"This house was built by _Thomas_,\" or \"It was _Thomas_  that built this house.\"    Thus, the emphasis on \"conqueror\" is not quite so strong in \"_A mere  conqueror_ ought not to obtain from us the reverence that is due to  the great benefactors of mankind,\" as in \"We ought not to bestow the  reverence that is due to the great benefactors of mankind, _upon a  mere conqueror_.\" Considerable, but less emphasis and greater  smoothness (19) will be obtained by writing the sentence thus: \"We  ought not to bestow upon a mere conqueror &c.\"    Where the same subject stands first in several consecutive sentences,  it rises in emphasis, and need not be removed from the beginning, even  though unusual emphasis be required:    \"The captain was the life and soul of the expedition. _He_ first  pointed out the possibility of advancing; _he_ warned them of the  approaching scarcity of provisions; _he_ showed how they might  replenish their exhausted stock &c.\"      *17. The object is sometimes placed before the verb for emphasis.*  This is most common in antithesis. \"_Jesus_ I know, and _Paul_ I know;  but who are ye?\" \"_Some_ he imprisoned, _others_ he put to death.\"    Even where there is no antithesis the inversion is not uncommon:    \"Military _courage_, the boast of the sottish German, of the frivolous  and prating Frenchman, of the romantic and arrogant Spaniard, he  neither possesses nor values.\"    This inversion sometimes creates ambiguity in poetry, _e.g._ \"The son  the father slew,\" and must be sparingly used"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22601"],[0,"Hiawatha and the Iroquois Confederation (#4)"],[1," the national council  reports the name of the candidate to the federal senate, in which resides  the power of ratifying or rejecting the choice of the nation; but the  power of rejection is rarely exercised, though that of expulsion for good  cause is not unfrequently exerted.  The new chief inherits the name of  his predecessor.  In this respect, as in some others, the resemblance of  the Great Council to the English House of Peers is striking.  As Norfolk  succeeds to Norfolk, so Tekarihoken succeeds Tekarihoken.  The great  names of Hiawatha and Atotarho are still borne by plain  farmer-councillors on the Canadian Reservation.    When the League was established, Hiawatha had been adopted by the Mohawk  nation as one of their chiefs.  The honor in which he was held by them is  shown by his position on the roll of councillors, as it has been handed  down from the earliest times.  As the Mohawk nation is the \"elder  brother,\" the names of its chiefs are first recited.  At the head of the  list is the leading Mohawk chief, Tekarihoken, who represents the noblest  lineage of the Iroquois stock.  Next to him, and second on the roll, is  the name of Hiawatha.  That of his great colleague, Dekanawidah, nowhere  appears.  He was a member of the first council; but he forbade his people  to appoint a successor to him.  \"Let the others have successors,\" he said  proudly, \"for others can advise you like them.  But I am the founder of  your league, and no one else can do what I have done.\"    The boast was not unwarranted.  Though planned by another, the structure  had been reared mainly by his labors.  But the Five Nations, while  yielding abundant honor to the memory of Dekanawidah, have never regarded  him with the same affectionate reverence which has always clung to the  name of Hiawatha.  His tender and lofty wisdom, his wide-reaching  benevolence, and his fervent appeals to their better sentiments, enforced  by the eloquence of which he was master, touched chords in the popular  heart which have continued to respond until this day.  Fragments of the  speeches in which he addressed the council and the people of the league  are still remembered and repeated.  The fact that the league only carried  out a part of the grand design which he had in view is constantly  affirmed.  Yet the failure was not due to lack of effort.  In pursuance  of his original purpose, when the league was firmly established, envoys  were sent to other tribes to urge them to join it or at least to become  allies.  One of these embassies penetrated to the distant Cherokees, the  hereditary enemies of the Iroquois nations.  For some reason with which  we are not acquainted--perhaps the natural suspicion or vindictive pride  of that powerful community--this mission was a failure.  Another,  despatched to the western Algonquins, had better success.  A strict  alliance was formed with the far-spread Ojibway tribes, and was  maintained inviolate for at least two hundred years, until at length the  influence of the French, with the sympathy of the Ojibways for the  conquered Hurons, undid to some extent, though not entirely, this portion  of Hiawatha's work.    His conceptions were beyond his time, and beyond ours; but their effect,  within a limited sphere, was very great.  For more than three centuries  the bond which he devised held together the Iroquois nations in perfect  amity.  It proved, moreover, as he intended, elastic.  The territory of  the Iroquois, constantly extending as their united strength made itself  felt, became the \"Great Asylum\" of the Indian tribes.  Of the conquered  Eries and Hurons, many hundreds were received and adopted among their  conquerors.  The Tuscaroras, expelled by the English from North Carolina,  took refuge with the Iroquois, and became the sixth nation of the League.  From still further south, the Tuteloes and Saponies, of Dakota stock,  after many wars with the Iroquois, fled to them from their other enemies,  and found a cordial welcome.  A chief still sits in the council as a  representative of the Tuteloes, though the tribe itself has been swept  away by disease, or absorbed in the larger nations.  Many fragments of  tribes of Algonquin lineage--Delawares, Nanticokes, Mohicans,  Mississagas,--sought the same hospitable protection, which never failed  them.  Their descendants still reside on the Canadian Reservation, which  may well be styled an aboriginal \"refuge of nations,\"--affording a  striking evidence in our own day of the persistent force of a great idea,  when embodied in practical shape by the energy of a master mind.    The name by which their constitution or organic law is known among them  is _kayanerenh_, to which the epitaph _kowa_ [Transcriber's note: the \"o\"  is the Unicode o-macron], \"great,\" is frequently added.  This word,  _kayanerenh_, is sometimes rendered \"law,\" or \"league,\" but its proper  meaning seems to be \"peace.\"  It is used in this sense by the  missionaries, in their translations of the scriptures and the  prayer-book.  In such expressions as \"the Prince of Peace,\" \"the author  of peace,\" \"give peace in our time,\" we find _kayanerenh_ employed with  this meaning.  Its root is _yaner_, signifying \"noble,\" or \"excellent,\"  which yields, among many derivatives, _kayanere_, \"goodness,\" and  _kayanerenh_, \"peace,\" or \"peacefulness.\"  The national hymn of the  confederacy, sung whenever their \"Condoling Council\" meets, commences  with a verse referring to their league, which is literally rendered, \"We  come to greet and thank the PEACE\" (_kayanerenh_).  When the list of  their ancient chiefs, the fifty original Councillors, is chanted in the  closing litany of the meeting, there is heard from time to time, as the  leaders of each clan are named, an outburst of praise, in the words--      \"This was the roll of you--    You that were joined in the work,    You that confirmed the work,      The GREAT PEACE.\" (_Kayanerenh-kowa._)    [Transcriber's note: the \"o\" in \"kowa\" is the Unicode o-macron.]      The regard of Englishmen for their Magna Charta and Bill of Rights, and  that of Americans for their national Constitution, seem weak in  comparison with the intense gratitude and reverence of the Five Nations  for the \"Great Peace\" which Hiawatha and his colleagues established for  them.    Of the subsequent life of Hiawatha, and of his death, we have no sure  information.  The records of the Iroquois are historical, and not  biographical.  As Hiawatha had been made a chief among the Mohawks, he  doubtless continued to reside with that nation.  A tradition, which is in  itself highly probable, represents him as devoting himself to the  congenial work of clearing away the obstructions in the streams which  intersect the country then inhabited by the confederated nations, and  which formed the chief means of communication between them.  That he  thus, in some measure, anticipated the plans of De Witt Clinton and his  associates, on a smaller scale, but with perhaps a larger statesmanship,  we may be willing enough to believe.  A wild legend, recorded by some  writers, but not told of him by the Canadian Iroquois, and apparently  belonging to their ancient mythology, gives him an apotheosis, and makes  him ascend to heaven in a white canoe.  It may be proper to dwell for a  moment on the singular complication of mistakes which has converted this  Indian reformer and statesman into a mythological personage.    When by the events of the Revolutionary war the original confederacy was  broken up, the larger portion of the people followed Brant to Canada.  The refugees comprised nearly the whole of the Mohawks, and the greater  part of the Onondagas and Cayugas, with many members of the other  nations.  In Canada their first proceeding was to reestablish, as far as  possible, their ancient league, with all its laws and ceremonies.  The  Onondagas had brought with them most of their wampum records, and the  Mohawks jealously preserved the memories of the federation, in whose  formation they had borne a leading part.  The history of the league  continued to be the topic of their orators whenever a new chief was  installed into office.  Thus the remembrance of the facts has been  preserved among them with much clearness and precision, and with very  little admixture of mythological elements.  With the fragments of the  tribes which remained on the southern side of the Great Lakes the case  was very different.  Except among the Senecas, who, of all the Five  Nations, had had least to do with the formation of the league, the  ancient families which had furnished the members of their senate, and  were the conservators of their history, had mostly fled to Canada or the  West.  The result was that among the interminable stories with which the  common people beguile their winter nights, the traditions of Atotarho and  Hiawatha became intermingled with the legends of their mythology.  An  accidental similarity, in the Onondaga dialect, between the name of  Hiawatha and that of one of their ancient divinities, led to a confusion  between the two, which has misled some investigators.  This deity bears,  in the sonorous Mohawk tongue, the name of Aronhiawagon, meaning \"the  Holder of the Heavens.\"  The early French missionaries, prefixing a  particle, made the name in their orthography, Tearonhiaouagon.  He was,  they tell us, \"the great god of the Iroquois.\"  Among the Onondagas of  the present day, the name is abridged to Taonhiawagi, or Tahiawagi.  The  confusion between this name and that of Hiawatha (which, in another form,  is pronounced Tayonwatha) seems to have begun more than a century ago;  for Pyrlaeus, the Moravian missionary, heard among the Iroquois  (according to Heckewelder) that the person who first proposed the league  was an ancient Mohawk, named Thannawege.  Mr. J. V. H. Clark, in his  interesting History of Onondaga, makes the name to have been originally  Ta-oun-ya-wat-ha, and"]]]
