[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26699"],[0,"The Woman and the Right to Vote (#4)"],[1," stupidities of that kind? If  that is the sort of respect and consideration that woman will lose if  she goes into politics, she ought to be very glad to get rid of it,  because all these empty phrases of gallantry are like the crowing of  the rooster who wishes to dazzle a silly hen on which he has designs.    And, tell me, how is it possible for weakness and ignorance to inspire  respect? As a matter of fact, when a little cooking, embroidering, and  music, and the knowledge of the catechism were deemed sufficient to  prepare a girl for married life, which was then the only career open  to woman, she was the recipient of great consideration and courtesy  from man. These, however, were not inspired by real respect, but  rather by a sentiment of chivalry, because man thought woman so weak  and ignorant that he deemed it his duty to show her that protection,  consideration, and courtesy which are due to weakness and ignorance. Is  this the opinion that our women want us to have of them? Respect is  a sentiment engendered by the idea of equality, and unless woman is  placed on the same level with man in the field of politics, we shall  continue to hear ignominious phrases such as \"But, woman, what do  you know about these things! You go and mind your own business!\"    Our women need not worry that if they are allowed to vote, they will  necessarily forfeit the consideration and courtesy accorded to them  at present, when they do not come into direct collision with man on  the field of politics, and that the men will then consider themselves  free to attack them as a rival whom they must overcome and destroy  for their own preservation. In the first place it is a mistake to  conclude that the participation of woman in public life will result  in rivalry between the sexes. The attraction and sympathy between man  and woman springs precisely from the difference in sex. If there were  only men or only women, there might be such a thing as our mutually  destroying each other, because there would be no purpose in life and  the human race would not reproduce itself. It is in the interest of  one sex not to destroy the other. On the other hand, politics is not  always a personal struggle. In its proper and loftiest sense it is a  struggle of ideas and principles, of theories and methods. Therefore,  if a man is pitted against a woman in the arena of politics, they  are certainly not compelled to engage in fisticuffs and kill each  other, but each will present his own views on the points at issue,  with more or less sound arguments in support of them. I do not believe  any man has the right to insult a woman because she is his opponent,  seeing that he has no such a right where a man is concerned. And  if in the heat of political strife such an insult should be passed,  has not woman the right to reply or to pay the offender back in his  own coin? This is a case where woman will be given an opportunity to  learn to be independent in judgment and action, seeing that certain  persons do not want woman to vote unless she possesses independence  of thought and action. I do not want, either, to give voice to the  suspicion that many men are against female suffrage because they fear  they might be worsted in a public debate, and what would then become  of the prestige of the strong sex?    In the second place, if woman wants man to adore and idolize her,  she can get him to do it whether she votes or not. Man does not  adore woman because she has less rights than he has; but he worships  her because woman is woman, the archetype of grace and beauty of  creation, and man will forever burn incense at the shrine of that  divinity. Remember that it has always been said that christianity  elevated the condition of woman and gave her greater rights, and yet  it is the Christian countries where woman is accorded the greatest  consideration and respect.    Suffrage will not detract from the beauty of the long tresses  of woman, nor will it make her cheeks and lips less rosy and the  curves of her body less graceful. On the contrary, it will lend her  an additional grace, that of being able to write a ballot in her  diminutive handwriting, and man will always feel for her that love,  tenderness, and adoration which grace and beauty will always inspire  all the world over. Hercules will always bow to Venus because she is  Venus, though Venus be a suffragist.    A political education will provide woman with new means for gaining the  respect and admiration of man. Woman will realize that her duty does  not merely consist in giving sons and daughters to the fatherland,  but in educating and training them in such a manner that from their  childhood on they will take interest in everything tending to improve  social conditions, and in inspiring them with the desire to devote  their efforts to a certain cause or party, for the best of their  people. Public opinion will become much broader and stronger when  it shall reflect the sentiments of our women, who are at present  a passive element where the duties of citizenship are concerned;  and when in her dark hours the nation shall need assistance, she will  receive it not only from her citizens, but also from her citizenesses,  who will not be ignorant and inexperienced in the tasks and duties  confronting the people, but will be accustomed to the discipline of  organization and to the calls of the public service.    There is no doubt, of course, that it is greatly to the advantage of  man to maintain woman in ignorance, not only with regard to politics,  but also where other matters are concerned. For one thing, it renders  it easier for man to satisfy his whims and make of woman a toy which he  can use or drop according to his fancy. She is obedient, submissive,  and resigned; she never discusses or argues; she obeys and serves  in silence, like a beautiful piece of furniture, differing from the  rest only in that she is animate; she is a delightful doll because  she can speak and has a little sense. I know that this is the ideal  of many men, for the only reason that it suits their convenience.    But that is not woman as she should be; the woman that our century has  redeemed from ignorance and slavery; the woman whom God has endowed  with an intellect, a will and a heart, hers to cultivate and perfect  in order that she may be not the servant of man, but his companion,  not the subject of the king, but the queen enthroned by his side,  to be his faithful and constant ally from the cradle to the grave,  in prosperity and adversity, not only in the intimacy of the home,  but also in the wide arena of public life. Man and woman were created  to mate and to understand and love each other, to work, suffer, and  struggle side by side for all that is good and beautiful in life,  to perpetuate the sovereignty of human couple on earth, and to make  it a place of happiness, free from tyranny and suffering and fit to  be inhabited by peaceful and intelligent beings and not by vultures  and wild beasts.    This is the mission of woman and man on earth as I understand and  conceive it. Until man and woman are placed on exactly the same  footing, until they stand on the same plane, so that there can be  an intimate communion of thoughts, ideas, and interests, life will  always be ominous and unhappy for one or for the other, and humanity  will never overcome the evils with which it is now struggling. God  made woman as perfect as man, and it is unjust to deprive her of any  of the benefits and advantages which man derives from science, arts,  and politics. Politics is a noble occupation, as it is the art or  science of making nations happy, and it is but just that woman should  contribute her share to the attainment of that happiness.    Is there any doubt that woman has faculties, sentiments, views,  and methods of doing things of her own, different from those of  man? How often has man, when he did not dare to do a thing, left it  to woman to do! She has a personality of her own and should, like  man, be given an opportunity to develop it; she should be given a  voice where her own interests are concerned, and should on her own  account face the risks incidental to life, venturing, experimenting,  and discovering things for herself instead of having man establish an  invariable rule of conduct for her and imposing upon her the methods  which she must follow.    Politics is no longer what it should be; it has become too masculine  and is brutal, selfish, and altogether too personal, because it  lacks the kindness, the self-denial, the altruism, and the spirit of  sacrifice which are characteristic qualities of the feminine sex. Why  should we not benefit by the energy of woman, by her impulses and  her views of things, in order to improve our practices and methods in  public life? Perhaps, politics will be chastened and purified to some  extent by the intervention and presence of woman, just as her presence  at any gathering makes man more careful in language and actions!    Like a number of other institutions that are now a thing of the past,  the monopoly exercised by man over the public functions is based on  force and violence, and in order to perpetuate this monopoly, its  supporters take shelter behind the wall of prejudice erected in the  course of the times under the protection of the established order of  things, and from there they hurl the shafts of satire and ridicule  upon all who demand that this violent condition cease. Ridicule is  the most powerful weapon now used against the woman who attempts to  obtain justice and the vindication of the rights of her sex, some of  which rights, such as that of governing the peoples, were not even  withheld from them in many of the primitive states.    The result is that many persons have a very queer idea of the  suffragist. She is represented as a woman who dislikes home work and  is absent from her home at all hours of the day and night.

As she read,  her face brightened.    \"Malicorne,\" cried she after having read it, \"In truth, you are a good  lad.\"    \"What for, mademoiselle?\"    \"Because you might have been paid for this commission, and you have  not.\" And she burst into a loud laugh, thinking to put the clerk out of  countenance; but Malicorne sustained the attack bravely.    \"I do not understand you,\" said he. It was now Montalais who was  disconcerted in her turn. \"I have declared my sentiments to you,\"  continued Malicorne. \"You have told me three times, laughing all the  while, that you did not love me; you have embraced me once without  laughing, and that is all I want.\"    \"All?\" said the proud and coquettish Montalais, in a tone through which  the wounded pride was visible.    \"Absolutely all, mademoiselle,\" replied Malicorne.    \"Ah!\"--And this monosyllable indicated as much anger as the young man  might have expected gratitude. He shook his head quietly.    \"Listen, Montalais,\" said he, without heeding whether that familiarity  pleased his mistress or not; \"let us not dispute about it.\"    \"And why not?\"    \"Because during the year which I have known you, you might have had me  turned out of doors twenty times if I did not please you.\"    \"Indeed; and on what account should I have had you turned out?\"    \"Because I have been sufficiently impertinent for that.\"    \"Oh, that,--yes, that's true.\"    \"You see plainly that you are forced to avow it,\" said Malicorne.    \"Monsieur Malicorne!\"    \"Don't let us be angry; if you have retained me, then it has not been  without cause.\"    \"It is not, at least, because I love you,\" cried Montalais.    \"Granted. I will even say, at this moment, I am certain that you hate  me.\"    \"Oh, you have never spoken so truly.\"    \"Well, on my part, I detest you.\"    \"Ah! I take the act.\"    \"Take it. You find me brutal and foolish; on my part I find you have a  harsh voice, and your face is too often distorted with anger. At this  moment you would allow yourself to be thrown out of that window rather  than allow me to kiss the tip of your finger; I would precipitate myself  from the top of the balcony rather than touch the hem of your robe. But,  in five minutes, you will love me, and I shall adore you. Oh, it is just  so.\"    \"I doubt it.\"    \"And I swear it.\"    \"Coxcomb!\"    \"And then, that is not the true reason. You stand in need of me, Aure,  and I of you. When it pleases you to be gay, I make you laugh; when it  suits me to be loving, I look at you. I have given you a commission  of lady of honor which you wished for; you will give me, presently,  something I wish for.\"    \"I will?\"    \"Yes, you will; but, at this moment, my dear Aure, I declare to you that  I wish for absolutely nothing, so be at ease.\"    \"You are a frightful man, Malicorne; I was going to rejoice at getting  this commission, and thus you quench my joy.\"    \"Good; there is no time lost,--you will rejoice when I am gone.\"    \"Go, then; and after--\"    \"So be it; but in the first place, a piece of advice.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Resume your good-humor,--you are ugly when you pout.\"    \"Coarse!\"    \"Come, let us tell the truth to each other, while we are about it.\"    \"Oh, Malicorne! Bad-hearted man!\"    \"Oh, Montalais! Ungrateful girl!\"    The young man leant with his elbow upon the window-frame; Montalais  took a book and opened it. Malicorne stood up, brushed his hat with his  sleeve, smoothed down his black doublet;--Montalais, though pretending  to read, looked at him out of the corner of her eye.    \"Good!\" cried she, furious; \"he has assumed his respectful air--and he  will pout for a week.\"    \"A fortnight, mademoiselle,\" said Malicorne, bowing.    Montalais lifted up her little doubled fist. \"Monster!\" said she; \"oh!  that I were a man!\"    \"What would you do to me?\"    \"I would strangle you.\"    \"Ah! very well, then,\" said Malicorne; \"I believe I begin to desire  something.\"    \"And what do you desire, Monsieur Demon? That I should lose my soul from  anger?\"    Malicorne was rolling his hat respectfully between his fingers; but, all  at once, he let fall his hat, seized the young girl by the shoulders,  pulled her towards him, and sealed her mouth with two lips that were  very warm, for a man pretending to so much indifference. Aure would have  cried out, but the cry was stifled in his kiss. Nervous and, apparently,  angry, the young girl pushed Malicorne against the wall.    \"Good!\" said Malicorne, philosophically, \"that's enough for six weeks.  Adieu, mademoiselle, accept my very humble salutation.\" And he made  three steps towards the door.    \"Well! no,--you shall not go!\" cried Montalais, stamping with her little  foot. \"Stay where you are! I order you!\"    \"You order me?\"    \"Yes; am I not mistress?\"    \"Of my heart and soul, without doubt.\"    \"A pretty property! _ma foi!_ The soul is silly and the heart dry.\"    \"Beware, Montalais, I know you,\" said Malicorne; \"you are going to fall  in love with your humble servant.\"    \"Well, yes!\" said she, hanging round his neck with childish indolence,  rather than with loving abandonment. \"Well, yes! for I must thank you at  least.\"    \"And for what?\"    \"For the commission; is it not my whole future?\"    \"And mine.\"    Montalais looked at him.    \"It is frightful,\" said she, \"that one can never guess whether you are  speaking seriously or not.\"    \"I cannot speak more seriously. I was going to Paris,--you are going  there,--we are going there.\"    \"And so it was for that motive only you have served me; selfish fellow!\"    \"What would you have me say, Aure? I cannot live without you.\"    \"Well! in truth, it is just so with me; you are, nevertheless, it must  be confessed, a very bad-hearted young man.\"    \"Aure, my dear Aure, take care! if you take to calling me names again,  you know the effect they produce upon me, and I shall adore you.\" And so  saying, Malicorne drew the young girl a second time towards him. But at  that instant a step resounded on the staircase. The young people were so  close, that they would have been surprised in the arms of each other, if  Montalais had not violently pushed Malicorne, with his back against  the door, just then opening. A loud cry, followed by angry reproaches,  immediately resounded. It was Madame de Saint-Remy who uttered the cry  and the angry words. The unlucky Malicorne almost crushed her between  the wall and the door she was coming in at.    \"It is again that good-for-nothing!\" cried the old lady. \"Always here!\"    \"Ah, madame!\" replied Malicorne, in a respectful tone; \"it is eight long  days since I was here.\"        Chapter III. In Which We at Length See the True Heroine of this History  Appear.    Behind Madame de Saint-Remy stood Mademoiselle de la Valliere. She heard  the explosion of maternal anger, and as she divined the cause of it,  she entered the chamber trembling, and perceived the unlucky Malicorne,  whose woeful countenance might have softened or set laughing whoever  observed it coolly. He had promptly intrenched himself behind a large  chair, as if to avoid the first attacks of Madame de Saint-Remy; he had  no hopes of prevailing with words, for she spoke louder than he, and  without stopping; but he reckoned upon the eloquence of his gestures.  The old lady would neither listen to nor see anything; Malicorne had  long been one of her antipathies. But her anger was too great not to  overflow from Malicorne on his accomplice. Montalais had her turn.    \"And you, mademoiselle; you may be certain I shall inform madame of what  is going on in the apartment of one of her ladies of honor?\"    \"Oh, dear mother!\" cried Mademoiselle de la Valliere, \"for mercy's sake,  spare--\"    \"Hold your tongue, mademoiselle, and do not uselessly trouble yourself  to intercede for unworthy people; that a young maid of honor like you  should be subjected to a bad example is, certes, a misfortune great  enough; but that you should sanction it by your indulgence is what I  will not allow.\"    \"But in truth,\" said Montalais, rebelling again, \"I do not know under  what pretense you treat me thus. I am doing no harm, I suppose?\"    \"And that great good-for-nothing, mademoiselle,\" resumed Madame de  Saint-Remy, pointing to Malicorne, \"is he here to do any good, I ask  you?\"    \"He is neither here for good nor harm, madame; he comes to see me, that  is all.\"    \"It is all very well! all very well!\" said the old lady. \"Her royal  highness shall be informed of it, and she will judge.\"    \"At all events, I do not see why,\" replied Montalais, \"it should be  forbidden M. Malicorne to have intentions towards me, if his intentions  are honorable.\"    \"Honorable intentions with such a face!\" cried Madame de Saint-Remy.    \"I thank you in the name of my face, madame,\" said Malicorne.    \"Come, my daughter, come,\" continued Madame de Saint-Remy; \"we will  go and inform madame that at the very moment she is weeping for her  husband, at the moment when we are all weeping for a master in this  old castle of Blois, the abode of grief, there are people who amuse  themselves with flirtations!\"    \"Oh!\" cried both the accused, with one voice.    \"A maid of honor! a maid of honor!\" cried the old lady, lifting her  hands towards heaven.    \"Well! it is"]]]
