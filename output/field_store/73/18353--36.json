She had learnt lessons when she felt inclined, and left them  undone when she was idle; and she had managed to make life in the  schoolroom such a purgatory that it had been difficult to persuade any  teacher to stay long at the Castle, and cope with so thankless a task  as her education.    It had been of little use to complain to her father, the only person in  the world whose authority she recognized; he was proud of his handsome  daughter, and, except when her temper crossed his own, was apt to  indulge her in most of her whims. Matters had at last, however, come to  a crisis. An act of more than usual assumption on Honor's part had  aroused Major Fitzgerald's utmost indignation, and had caused him  suddenly to decide that she was spoiling at home, and that the only  possible solution of the difficulty was to dispatch her to school as  soon as the necessary arrangements could be made for her departure.    The incident that led to this resolution was very characteristic of  Honor's headstrong, impulsive nature. She was passionately fond of  horses, and for some time had been anxious to possess a new pony. It  was not that she loved Pixie, her former favourite, any the less; but  he was growing old, and was now scarcely able to take a fence, or carry  her in mad career over the moors, being only fit for a sober trot on  the high road, or to draw her mother's Bath chair round the garden. To  obtain a strong, well-bred, fiery substitute for Pixie was the summit  of Honor's ambition. One day, when she was with her father at  Ballycroghan, she saw exactly the realization of her ideal. It was a  small black cob, which showed a trace of Arab blood in its arching  neck, slender limbs, and easy, springy motion. Though its bright eyes  proved its high spirit, it was nevertheless as gentle as a lamb, and  well accustomed to carrying a lady. Its owner, a local horse-dealer,  was anxious to sell it, and pressed Major Fitzgerald to take it as a  bargain. Honor simply fell in love with it on the spot. She ascertained  that its name was Firefly, and begged and besought her father to buy it  for her. But on this occasion he would not yield, even to her utmost  coaxing. He did not wish to keep another pony in the stable, and he  considered the price asked was excessive, and entirely beyond the  present limits of his purse.    \"No, Honor, it can't be done,\" he said. \"You must be content with poor  old Pixie. I have quite enough expenses just now, without running into  such an extravagance.\"    \"But couldn't I have it instead of something else?\" pleaded Honor.    \"There's nothing we could knock off, dear child,\" replied her father.    \"I could do without a governess,\" suggested Honor hopefully. \"I'd set  myself my own lessons, and learn them too. Oh, Daddy, darling, if we  gave up Miss Bury, wouldn't you have money enough to buy Firefly?\"    Major Fitzgerald laughed in spite of himself.    \"I consider Miss Bury a necessity, and not a luxury,\" he replied. \"A  governess is the very last person we could dispense with. I should like  to see you setting your own lessons! Remarkably short and easy ones  they would be! No, little woman, I'm afraid Firefly is an  impossibility, and you must just try to forget his existence.\"    Unfortunately, that was exactly what Honor could not do. She thought  continually about the beautiful black cob, and the more she dwelt on  her disappointment the more keenly she felt it. She considered, most  unreasonably, that her governess was the alternative of the pony, and  that if she were without the one she might possibly acquire the other.  Her behaviour had never been exemplary, but on the strength of this  grievance she grew so unruly, so disrespectful, and so absolutely  unmanageable that Miss Bury at length refused to teach her any longer,  and, after an interview with Major Fitzgerald in the library, packed  her boxes and returned home to England.    Honor viewed her exodus with keen delight. It seemed the removal of an  obstacle to her plan. She went in to luncheon determined to broach once  more the subject of Firefly, hoping this time to meet with better  success. She saw at once, however, from her father's face, that he was  not in a suitable mood to grant her any favour. He was much annoyed at  the governess's departure, for which he had the justice to blame Honor  alone; and he was worried with business matters.    \"That tiresome agent has not sent the telegram I expected,\" he  announced. \"I shall be obliged to go over to Cork, to consult my  solicitor. Tell Murphy to have the trap ready by two o'clock, and let  Holmes pack my bag. I shall probably be away until Friday evening.\"    As soon as her father had started for the station, Honor sauntered out  in the direction of the stables. It was one of her mother's bad days.  Mrs. Fitzgerald was confined to her room, therefore Honor, released  from Miss Bury's authority, felt herself her own mistress. Finding  Fergus, the groom, she ordered him to saddle Pixie, and make ready to  accompany her on a ride. Fergus was devoted to \"Miss Honor\", and would  never have dreamt of disputing any command she might give him; before  three o'clock, therefore, her pony was at the door, and, dressed in her  neat blue habit, she was ambling away in the direction of Ballycroghan.  It was a leisurely progress, for poor Pixie's gait was slow, in spite  of his best endeavours, and Honor loved him too well to urge him hard.    She was determined to call at the horse-dealer's, and to ascertain if  Firefly were still for sale. Perhaps, when her father returned home,  she might catch him at a favourable moment, and be able to cajole him  into changing his mind and buying the cob. Mr. O'Connor, the  horse-dealer, lived at a large farm on the way to the town, and, to  Honor's intense delight, the first object that met her eyes on  approaching the house was Firefly, feeding demurely in a paddock to the  left of the road. By an equally lucky chance Mr. O'Connor happened to  be at home, and came hurrying out at once when he saw \"one of the  quality\", as he expressed it, drawing bridle at his door.    \"Good afternoon! I see you still have the black cob,\" began Honor  eagerly.    \"Yes, missy,\" replied the horse-dealer, \"and I was thinking of sending  a message to your father about him this very day. It's the good fortune  to see you here! I've had a man over from Limerick who's anxious to  take him--a tradesman who'd run him in a light cart--but I didn't close  the bargain at once. I said to my wife: 'Firefly is too good a breed to  carry out groceries. I'd rather be for selling him to the Castle. Miss  Fitzgerald took the fancy for him, and I'll not be parting with him  till I've had word again from the Major.' Maybe his honour will be  wanting him, after all? But sure I must know at once, for the Limerick  man will be here at noon to-morrow, and I've promised to tell him one  way or another.\"    \"Could you possibly wait until Saturday?\" asked Honor.    The dealer shook his head.    \"I can't afford to miss a sale,\" he replied. \"I've had the cob on my  hands for some time; it's just eating its head off, and it's anxious I  am to get rid of it.\"    Honor was in a fever of excitement. Firefly, so spirited and so  aristocratic, whose delicately shaped limbs looked only fit for leaping  brooks, or cantering over the short grass on the uplands, to be sold to  a tradesman, and to run between the shafts of a cart that delivered  groceries! It seemed a degradation and an outrage. She could not dream  of allowing it; she must save him at any cost from such a fate.    \"Must you absolutely have an answer to-day?\" she asked.    \"Yes, missy. I fear I couldn't put off Sullivan any longer than noon  to-morrow. He's a touchy man, and ready to carry his business  elsewhere.\"    \"Very well, then, that settles the matter. We will take the cob. You  may send him over to the Castle this evening.\"    [Illustration: HONOR CONCLUDES THE PURCHASE OF FIREFLY]    Honor spoke in such a high-handed manner that the dealer never guessed  she was acting on her own authority. As she had made a special visit to  the farm, accompanied by her groom, he imagined she must have been  entrusted by Major Fitzgerald with full powers to buy the pony if she  wished.    \"Many thanks to you, missy! It's the fine mistress you'll make for  Firefly. My respects to his honour, and the price shall be the same as  I was asking him before.\"    The price! Honor had quite forgotten that. Weighed against Firefly's  possible future, it had seemed an unimportant detail. She remembered  now, however, that her father had considered it extravagant, and  declared he could not afford it. The thought was sufficient to check  her joy suddenly, and to send her home in a sober frame of mind that  was well justified by the sequel.    Major Fitzgerald's wrath, when he arrived on the Friday and found the  black cob installed in the stable, was more serious than his daughter  had ever experienced before.    \"It was a piece of unwarranted presumption!\" he declared. \"I shall not  allow you to keep the pony. It must be sent back to O'Connor's, and  resold at the first opportunity. As for you, the sooner you are packed  off to school the better. We have indulged you too much at home, and it  is time indeed that you learnt to submit to some kind of discipline.\"    The proposal to send her away to school was a terrible blow to Honor.  At first she appealed to her mother, begging her to plead with her  father and try to persuade him to alter his resolution. But Mrs.  Fitzgerald, while regretting to part with her troublesome daughter, was  so convinced of the wisdom of the proceeding that, instead of  interceding, she applauded her husband's decision.    \"I can't ever like England!\" sobbed Honor. \"I'd rather have our  mountains and lakes and bogs than all the grand streets and houses.

If the external quarrels of England were the immediate cause of the  foundation of Virginia, the two colonies which next make their  appearance owe their origin to her internal divisions. James I. and his  son Charles I., though by conviction much more genuine Protestants than  Elizabeth, were politically more disposed to treat the Catholics with  leniency. The paradox is not, perhaps, difficult to explain. Being more  genuinely Protestant they were more interested in the internecine  quarrels of Protestants, and their enemies in those internecine  quarrels, the Puritans, now become a formidable party, were naturally  the fiercest enemies of the old religion. This fact probably led the two  first Stuarts to look upon that religion with more indulgence. They  dared not openly tolerate the Catholics, but they were not unwilling to  show them such favour as they could afford to give. Therefore when a  Catholic noble, Lord Baltimore, proposed to found a new plantation in  America where his co-religionists could practise their faith in peace  and security, the Stuart kings were willing enough to grant his request.  James approved the project, his son confirmed it, and, under a Royal  Charter from King Charles I., Lord Baltimore established his Catholic  colony, which he called \"Maryland.\" The early history of this colony is  interesting because it affords probably the first example of full  religious liberty. It would doubtless have been suicidal for the  Catholics, situated as they were, to attempt anything like persecution,  but Baltimore and the Catholics of Maryland for many generations deserve  none the less honour for the consistency with which they pursued their  tolerant policy. So long as the Catholics remained in control all sects  were not only tolerated but placed on a footing of complete equality  before the law, and as a fact both the Nonconformist persecuted in  Virginia and the Episcopalian persecuted in New England frequently found  refuge and peace in Catholic Maryland. The English Revolution of 1689  produced a change. The new English Government was pledged against the  toleration of a Catholicism anywhere. The representative of the  Baltimore family was deposed from the Governorship and the control  transferred to the Protestants, who at once repealed the edicts of  toleration and forbade the practice of the Catholic religion. They did  not, however, succeed in extirpating it, and to this day many of the old  Maryland families are Catholic, as are also a considerable proportion of  the Negroes. It may further be noted that, though the experiment in  religious equality was suppressed by violence, the idea seems never to  have been effaced, and Maryland was one of the first colonies to  accompany its demand for freedom with a declaration in favour of  universal toleration.    At about the same time that the persecuted Catholics found a refuge in  Maryland, a similar refuge was sought by the persecuted Puritans. A  number of these, who had found a temporary home in Holland, sailed  thence for America in the celebrated _Mayflower_ and colonized New  England on the Atlantic coast far to the north of the plantations of  Raleigh and Baltimore. From this root sprang the colonies of  Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Rhode Island, and later the  States of New Hampshire and Maine. It would be putting it with ironical  mildness to say that the Pilgrim Fathers did not imitate the tolerant  example of the Catholic refugees. Religious persecution had indeed been  practised by all parties in the quarrels of the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries; but for much of the early legislation of the  Puritan colonies one can find no parallel in the history of European  men. Calvinism, that strange fierce creed which Wesley so correctly  described as one that gave God the exact functions and attributes of the  devil, produced even in Europe a sufficiency of madness and horror; but  here was Calvinism cut off from its European roots and from the reaction  and influence of Christian civilization. Its records read like those of  a madhouse where religious maniacs have broken loose and locked up their  keepers. We hear of men stoned to death for kissing their wives on the  Sabbath, of lovers pilloried or flogged at the cart's tail for kissing  each other at all without licence from the deacons, the whole  culminating in a mad panic of wholesale demonism and witchburning so  vividly described in one of the most brilliant of Mrs. Gaskell's  stories, \"Lois the Witch.\" Of course, in time the fanaticism of the  first New England settlers cooled into something like sanity. But a  strong Puritan tradition remained and played a great part in American  history. Indeed, if Lee, the Virginian, has about him something of the  Cavalier, it is still more curious to note that nineteenth-century New  England, with its atmosphere of quiet scholars and cultured tea parties,  suddenly flung forth in John Brown a figure whose combination of  soldierly skill with maniac fanaticism, of a martyr's fortitude with a  murderer's cruelty, seems to have walked straight out of the seventeenth  century and finds its nearest parallel in some of the warriors of the  Covenant.    The colonies so far enumerated owe their foundation solely to English  enterprise and energy; but in the latter half of the seventeenth century  foreign war brought to England a batch of colonies ready made. At the  mouth of the Hudson River, between Maryland and the New England  colonies, lay the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam. The first colonists  who had established themselves there had been Swedes, but from Sweden  its sovereignty had passed to Holland, and the issue of the Dutch wars  gave it to the English, by whom it was re-christened New York in honour  of the King's brother, afterwards James II. It would perhaps be  straining the suggestion already made of the persistent influences of  origins to see in the varied racial and national beginnings of New York  a presage of that cosmopolitan quality which still marks the greatest  of American cities, making much of it a patchwork of races and  languages, and giving to the electric stir of Broadway an air which  suggests a Continental rather than an English city, but it is more  plausible to note that New York had no original link with the Puritanism  of New England and of the North generally, and that in fact we shall  find the premier city continually isolated from the North, following a  tradition and a policy of its own.    With New Amsterdam was also ceded the small Dutch plantation of  Delaware, which lay between Maryland and the Atlantic, while England at  the same time established her claim to the disputed territory between  the two which became the colony of New Jersey.    Shortly after the cession of New Amsterdam William Penn obtained from  Charles II. a charter for the establishment of a colony to the north of  Maryland, between that settlement and the newly acquired territories of  New Jersey and New York. This plantation was designed especially as a  refuge for the religious sect to which Penn belonged, the Quakers, who  had been persecuted by all religious parties and especially savagely by  the Puritan colonists of New England. Penn, the most remarkable man that  ever professed the strange doctrines of that sect, was a favourite with  the King, who had a keen eye for character, and as the son of a  distinguished admiral he had a sort of hereditary claim upon the  gratitude of the Crown. He easily carried his point with Charles, and  himself supervised the foundations of the new commonwealth of  Pennsylvania. Two surveyors were sent out by royal authority to fix the  boundary between Penn's concession and the existing colony of  Maryland--Mr. Mason and Mr. Dixon by name. However elated these two  gentlemen may have been by their appointment to so responsible an  office, they probably little thought that their names would be  immortalized. Yet so it was to be. For the line they drew became the  famous \"Mason-Dixon\" line, and was to be in after years the frontier  between the Slave States and the Free.    In all that he did in the New World Penn showed himself not only a great  but a most just and wise man. He imitated, with happier issue, the  liberality of Baltimore in the matter of religious freedom, and to this  day the Catholics of Philadelphia boast of possessing the only Church in  the United States in which Mass has been said continuously since the  seventeenth century. But it is in his dealings with the natives that  Penn's humanity and honour stand out most conspicuously. None of the  other founders of English colonies had ever treated the Indians except  as vermin to be exterminated as quickly as possible. Penn treated them  as free contracting parties with full human rights. He bought of them  fairly the land he needed, and strictly observed every article of the  pact that he made with them. Anyone visiting to-day the city which he  founded will find in its centre a little strip of green, still unbuilt  upon, where, in theory, any passing Indians are at liberty to pitch  their camp--a monument and one of the clauses of Penn's celebrated  treaty.    In the same reign the settlement of the lands lying to the south of  Virginia had begun, under the charter granted by Charles II. to the Hyde  family, and the new plantations were called after the sovereign  \"Carolina.\" But their importance dates from the next century, when they  received the main stream of a new tide of immigration due to political  and economic causes.
