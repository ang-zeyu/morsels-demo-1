[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#4)"],[1," their bounds divide!\"    In a letter from Southey to Mr. Britton (dated in 1810, to which we have  already referred, and which Mr. Britton kindly submitted to us with  various other correspondence on the subject), he says, \"there can now be  no impropriety in mentioning what could not be said when the collected  edition of Chatterton's works was published,--that there was a taint of  insanity in his family. His sister was once confined; and this is a key  to the eccentricities of his life, and the deplorable rashness of his  death.\" Of this unhappy predisposition, indeed, he seems to have been  himself conscious, for \"in his last will and testament,\" written in  April, 1770, before he quitted Bristol, when he seems to have meditated  suicide--although, from the mock-heroic style of the document his  serious design may be questioned,--he writes, \"If I do a mad action, it  is conformable to every action of my life, which all savored of  insanity.\" His \"sudden fits of weeping, for which no reason could be  assigned,\" when a mere child, were but the preludes to those gloomy  forebodings which haunted him when a boy. His mother had said, \"she was  often apprehensive of his going mad.\"    And so,--the verdict having been pronounced, he was cast into  the burying-ground of Shoe Lane work-house--the paupers'  burying-ground,--the end, as far as his clayey tabernacle was concerned,  of all his dreamy greatness. When the ear was deaf to the worship of the  charmer, he received his meed of posthumous praise. Malone, Croft, Dr.  Knox, Wharton, Sherwin, Pye, Mrs. Cowley, Walter Scott, Haley,  Coleridge, Dermody, Wordsworth, Shelley, William Howitt, Keats, who  dedicated his \"Endymion\" to the memory of his fellow-genius; the burly  Johnson, whose praise seemed unintentional; the gentle and most  Christian poet, James Montgomery,--have each and all offered tributes to  his memory. Robert Southey, whose polished, strong and long unclouded  mind was a treasure-house of noble-thoughts, assisted Mr. Cottle in  providing for the poet's family by a collection of his works; and,  though last, not least, excellent John Britton has labored all his long  life to render justice to the poor boy's memory. To him, indeed, it was  mainly owing, that the cenotaph to which we have referred (and which now  lies mouldering in the Church vault), was erected in the graveyard of  Redcliffe Church, by subscription, of which the contributions of Bristol  were very small.[12]    Chatterton was another warning, not only                   \"Against self-slaughter      There is a prohibition so divine--\"    but that no mortal should ever abandon Hope! for a reverend  gentleman,--who was, in all things, what, unhappily, Horace Walpole was  not,--had actually visited Bristol, to seek out and aid the boy while he  lay dead in London.        \"Beware of desperate steps; the darkest day,      Live till to-morrow, will have passed away.\"    [Illustration: CHATTERTON'S MONUMENT.]    The knowledge of these facts cheered us as we set forth to the  neighborhood of Shoe-Lane to see the spot where he had been laid. Alas,  it is very hard to keep pace with the progress of London changes. After  various inquiries, we were told that Mr. Bentley's printing office  stands upon the ground of Shoe-Lane Workhouse. We ascended the steps  leading to this shifting emporium of letters, and found ourselves face  to face with a kind gentleman, who told us all he knew upon the subject,  which was, that the printing office stands--not upon the burying-ground  of Shoe-Lane Workhouse, where he had always understood Chatterton was  buried--but upon the church burial-ground. He showed us a very curious  basso-relievo, in cut-stone, of the Resurrection, which he assured us  had been \"time out of mind\" above the entrance to the Shoe-Lane  burying-place \"over the way,\" and which is now the site of Farrington  Market. This, when \"all the bones\" were moved to the old graveyard in  Gray's Inn Road, had come \"somehow\" into Mr. Bentley's possession.    We were told also that Mr. Taylor, another printer, had lived, before  the workhouse was pulled down, where his office-window looked upon the  spot pointed out as the grave of Chatterton, and that a stone, \"a rough  white stone,\" was remembered to have been \"set in a wall\" near the grave  with \"Thomas Chatterton\" and something else \"scratched\" into it.    We strayed back through the damp chill of the city's evening fog to the  market-place, hoping, even unconsciously, to stand beside the pit into  which the marvellous boy had been thrust; but we grew bewildered. And as  we stood upon the steps looking down upon the market--alone in feeling,  and unconscious of every thing but our own thoughts--St. Paul's bell  struck, full, loud, and clear; and, casting our eyes upward, we saw its  mighty dome through the murky atmosphere. We became still more \"mazed,\"  and fancied we were gazing upon the monument of Thomas Chatterton!    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Of Edward Colston, well and beautifully has William Howitt said,  \"You cannot help feeling the grand beneficence of those wealthy  merchants, who, like Edward Colston, make their riches do their generous  will for ever; who become thereby the actual fathers of their native  cities to all generations; who roll off, every year of the world's  progress, some huge stone of anxiety from the hearts of poor widows; who  clear the way before the unfriended, but active and worthy lad; who put  forth their invisible hands from the heaven of their rest, and become  the genuine guardian angels of the orphan race for ever and ever:  raising from those who would otherwise have been outcasts and ignorant  laborers, aspiring and useful men; tradesmen of substance; merchants the  true enrichers of their country, and fathers of happy families. How  glorious is such a lot! how noble is such an appropriation of wealth!  how enviable is such a fame! And amongst such men there were few more  truly admirable than Edward Colston! He was worthy to have been lifted  by Chatterton, to the side of the magnificent Canynge, and one cannot  help wondering that he says so little about this great benefactor of his  city.\"    [2] Our engraving shows this house, and Bristol Bridge, both memorable  as being connected with the earliest of Chatterton's fabrications.  Bristol Bridge was finished in September, 1768, and in the October  following Chatterton sent to \"Felix Farley's Bristol Journal,\" the  curiously detailed account of the ceremonial observances on opening the  ancient bridge at Bristol, 'taken from an Old Manuscript,' and which,  being his first printed forgery, led, by the attention it excited, to  the production of other work, and among them the Rowley Poems. At this  time he was in his 16th year; but some years before he had fabricated  Burgum's pedigree, and some poetry by a pretended ancestor of his, of  the alleged date of 1320, called \"The Romaunte of the Knyghte.\" The  house where Burgum lived, and where Chatterton first tried his powers of  deception, is the central one of the three seen above the bridge in our  cut.    [3] The place of Chatterton's birth has been variously stated: Mr. Dix,  in his \"Life of Chatterton,\" has mentioned _three_. His first being that  \"he was born on the 29th of November, in the year 1752, in a house  situated on Redcliff Hill, behind the shop now (1837) occupied by Mr.  Hasell, grocer,\" and which has since been destroyed. But in the appendix  to his volume is a communication stating that Mrs. Newton (Chatterton's  married sister) left a daughter who \"died in 1807, in the house where  Chatterton was born; I believe in the arch at Cathay,\" a street leading  from the church-yard to the river-side. But the most certain account  seems to be that of Mrs. Edkins (also printed by Dix) who \"went to  school to Chatterton's father, and was present when the son was born, at  the Pyle School.\" Now, as Chatterton was born about three months after  his father's death, and he had been for some years master of the school,  it is unlikely that his wife would be removed from the house she  inhabited until after her confinement, \"when,\" says Mrs. Edkins, \"she  went to a house opposite the upper gate on Redcliff Hill.\" The house  appropriated to the master of Pyle Street School is shown in our  engraving, it is at the back of the school, which faces the street, and  is approached by an open passage on one side of it leading into a small  court-yard, beyond which is a little garden. Over the door is inserted a  stone, inscribed, \"This house was erected by Giles Malpas, of St. Thomas  Parish, Gent., for the use of the master of this School, A. D. 1749.\"  The house has but two sitting rooms, one on each side of the door, that  to the right being the kitchen; and in one of them the dissolute father  of the Poet is said by Dix to have \"often passed the whole night roaring  out catches, with some of the lowest rabble of the parish.\" He was  succeeded in the office of Schoolmaster by Edmond Chard, who held it for  five years; and he was followed in 1757 by Stephen Love, who was master  twenty-one years, and to whom Mrs. Chatterton first sent her son for  education; and who, \"after exhausting the patience of his schoolmaster,  was sent back to his mother with the character of a stupid boy, and one  who was absolutely incapable of receiving instruction.\"    [4] This School, founded in 1708 by Edward Colston, Esq., is situated in  a street called St. Augustine's Back, behind the houses facing the  drawbridge. It is the mansion in which Queen Elizabeth was entertained  when she visited the city; and was purchased by Colston, because of its  applicability to his charitable purposes. Here the scholars are boarded,  lodged, and clothed, and are never permitted to be absent--except on  Saturdays and Saints' days, from one till seven. They are simply taught  reading, writing, and arithmetic. The school-room is on the first floor, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26198"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 8) (#4)"],[1,"         Major-General H. J.
