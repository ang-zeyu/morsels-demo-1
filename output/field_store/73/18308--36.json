He is not a fiction of  hieratic imagination, whom priests regale with hyperbolic flattery  qualified only by the lukewarmness of their belief in their own words.  He is a living personality in the faith of the people; the priests  only invent words to express the people's faith, and perhaps add to  the old legends some riddling fancies of their own. Many times they  tell us that after conquering Vritra and setting free the waters or  the kine Indra created the light, the dawn, or the sun; or they say  that he produced them without mentioning any fight with Vritra;  sometimes they speak of him as setting free \"the kine of the Morning,\"  which means that they understood the cows to signify the light of  morning, and it would seem also that they thought that the waters  mentioned in the story signified the rain. But why do they speak of  these acts as heroic deeds, exploits of a mighty warrior, in the same  tone and with the same epic fire as when they sing of Indra's battles  in times near to their own, real battles in which their own  forefathers, strong in their faith in the god, shattered the armies of  hostile Aryan tribes or the fortresses of dark-skinned natives? The  personality of Indra and the spirit in which his deeds are recounted  remind us of hero-sagas; the allegories which the poets read into them  are on the other hand quite in the style of the priest. How can we  explain the presence of these two voices? Besides, why should the  setting free of the rain or the daylight be a peculiarly heroic  attribute of Indra? Other gods are said to do the same things as part  of their regular duties: Parjanya, Mitra and Varuna, Dyaus, dispense  the rain, others the light.    The explanation is simple. Indra, it seems to me, is a god of just the  same sort as Zeus, whose nature and history I have already explained  according to my lights. In the far-away past Indra was simply a hero:  very likely he was once a chieftain on earth. The story of his great  deeds so fascinated the imagination of men that they worshipped his  memory and at last raised him to the rank of a chief god. Now they had  previously worshipped two very high gods; one of these was  Dyaush-pita, the Sky-father, of whom I have spoken before, and another  was Tvashta, the All-creator. So some of them, as the Rig-veda  proves, declared that Dyaus was the father of Indra, and others appear  to have given this honour to Tvashta, while others regarded Tvashta as  Indra's grandfather; and some even said that in order to obtain the  soma to inspire him to divine deeds Indra killed his father, which of  course is just an imaginative way of saying that Indra was made into a  god and worshipped in place of the elder god.    The puzzle now is solved. Indra has remained down to the time of the  Rig-veda true to his early nature, an epic hero and typical warrior;  but he has also borrowed from the old Sky-father the chief attributes  of a sky-spirit, especially the giving of rain and the making of  light, which the priests of the Rig-veda riddlingly describe as  setting free the waters and the cows. He bears the thunderbolt, as  does also Zeus; like Zeus, he has got it from the Sky-father, who had  likewise a thunderbolt, according to some Rigvedic poets, though  others say it was forged for him by Tvashta, his other father. I even  venture to think that there is a kernel of heroic legend in the story  of the slaying of Vritra; that at bottom it is a tale relating how  Indra with a band of brave fellows stormed a mountain hold surrounded  by water in which dwelt a wicked chieftain who had carried away the  cattle of his people, and that when Indra had risen to the rank of a  great god of the sky men added to this plain tale much mythical  decoration appropriate to his new quality, turning the comrades of  Indra into the storm-gods and interpreting the waters and cows to mean  rain and daylight. Since most of us are agreed that stories such as  that of Indra defeating Sambara for the benefit of Divodasa refer to  real events, it seems unnatural to suppose that the Vritra-legend is a  purely imaginary myth. We can thus explain why the ideas of Indra  setting free the rain and the light fit in so awkwardly with the  heroic element in the legend: for they are merely secondary  attributes, borrowed from the myths of other gods and mechanically  attached to Indra on his elevation in the pantheon. But we can explain  much more. There is a regular cycle of hero-saga connected with Indra  which is visible or half-visible at the back of some of the Vedic  hymns and of the priestly literature which is destined to follow them.    The truth is that the priests of the Rig-veda on the whole have not  quite made up their minds about Indra's merits, and we shall find them  a few generations hence equally uncertain. They praise his heroic  deeds lustily and admire his power immensely; but they are keenly  aware that he is a god with a past, and sometimes they dwell on that.  Their favourite method is to relate some of his former questionable  deeds in the form of a reproach, and then to turn the story to his  credit in some way or another; but as time goes on and the priests  think less and less of most of their gods, Indra's character will  steadily sink, and in the end we shall find him playing a subordinate  part, a debauched king in a sensuous paradise, popularly worshipped as  a giver of rain. But this is to anticipate. As yet Indra is to the  Rigvedic priests a very great god; but how did he become so? If we  read carefully the hymn RV. IV. xviii.[7] we see at the back of it a  story somewhat like this. Before he was born, Tvashta, Indra's  grandfather, knew that Indra would dispossess him of his sovereignty  over the gods, and therefore did his best to prevent his birth (cf.  RV. III. xlviii.); but the baby Indra would not be denied, and he  forced his way into the light of day through the side of his mother  Aditi, who seems to be the same as Mother Earth (cf. _Ved. Stud._, ii,  p. 86), killed his father, and drank Tvashta's soma, by which he  obtained divine powers. In v. 12 of this hymn Indra excuses himself by  saying that he was in great straits, and that then the soma was  brought to him by an eagle. What these straits were is indicated in  another hymn (IV. xxvii.), which tells us that he was imprisoned, and  escaped on the back of the eagle, which he compelled to carry him; the  watchman Krisanu shot an arrow at the bird, but it passed harmlessly  through its feathers. Evidently in the story Indra had a hard struggle  with rival gods. One poet says (RV. IV. xxx. 3): \"Not even all the  gods, O Indra, defeated thee, when thou didst lengthen days into  nights,\" which apparently refers also to some miracle like that  ascribed to Joshua. Another tradition (MS. I. vi. 12) relates that  while Indra and his brother Vivasvan were still unborn they declared  their resolve to oust the Adityas, the elder sons of their mother  Aditi; so the Adityas tried to kill them when born, and actually slew  Vivasvan, but Indra escaped. Another version (TS. II. iv. 13) says  that the gods, being afraid of Indra, bound him with fetters before he  was born; and at the same time Indra is identified with the Rajanya,  or warrior class, as its type and representative.[8] This last point  is immensely important, for it really clinches the matter. Not once,  but repeatedly, the priestly literature of the generations that will  follow immediately after that of the Rig-veda will be found to treat  Indra as the type of the warrior order.[9] They will describe an  imaginary coronation-ceremony of Indra, ending with these words:  \"Anointed with this great anointment Indra won all victories, found  all the worlds, attained the superiority, pre-eminence, and supremacy  over all the gods, and having won the overlordship, the paramount  rule, the self rule, the sovereignty, the supreme authority, the  kingship, the great kingship, the suzerainty in this world,  self-existing, self-ruling, immortal, in yonder world of heaven,  having attained all desires he became immortal.\"[10] Thus we see that  amidst the maze of obscure legends about Indra there are three points  which stand out with perfect clearness. They are, firstly, that Indra  was a usurper; secondly, that the older gods fought hard but vainly to  keep him from supreme divinity, and that in his struggle he killed his  father; and thirdly, that he was identified with the warrior class, as  opposed to the priestly order, or Brahmans. This antagonism to the  Brahmans is brought out very clearly in some versions of the tales of  his exploits. More than once the poets of the Rig-veda hint that his  slaying of Vritra involved some guilt, the guilt of _brahma-hatya_, or  slaughter of a being in whom the _brahma_, or holy spirit, was  embodied[11]; and this is explained clearly in a priestly tale (TS.  II. v. 2, 1 ff.; cf. SB. I. i. 3, 4, vi. 3, 8), according to which  Indra from jealousy killed Tvashta's son Visvarupa, who was chaplain  of the gods, and thus he incurred the guilt of _brahma-hatya_. Then  Tvashta held a soma-sacrifice; Indra, being excluded from it, broke up  the ceremony and himself drank the soma. The soma that was left over  Tvashta cast into one of the sacred fires and produced thereby from it  the giant Vritra, by whom the whole universe, including Agni and Soma,  was enveloped (cf. the later version in Mahabharata, V. viii. f.). By  slaying him Indra again became guilty of _brahma-hatya_; and some  Rigvedic poets hint that it was the consciousness of this sin which  made him flee away after the deed was done.    [Footnote 7: I follow in the interpretation of this hymn E. Sieg, _Die  Sagenstoffe des Rgveda_, i. p. 76 ff. Cf. on the subject _Ved. Stud._,  i. p. 211, ii. pp. 42-54. Charpentier, _Die Suparnasage_, takes a  somewhat different view of RV.

We made our morning Memorial  together (being all of us Christians bound on some sort of a  Christian pilgrimage), and after that we breakfasted and smoked  at ease while the mules grazed close by, and the driver boiled  his pot, and fed it with meal, and stirred and ladled out, and  ate in the fullness of time. My heart was very thankful. How much  better and kindlier one's lot seemed now fallen as it was once  again in this fair ground of a country at peace in Wartime. This  countryside pleased me ever so much better than British East or  German East this Mashonaland. There to north I remembered without  enthusiasm the tropical passions of the elements, I remembered  rather miserably some of the things that a state of war had  meant.    After breakfast, there was no hurry about our inspanning. But  when we had once got off we were soon up level with the farmhouse  on the hill's shoulder. We halted for friendship's sake, and  waited for the cups of coffee that we were assured would be soon  ready. Our host was Dutch-looking, but seemed British; I thought  rather narrowly British in his sympathies. He discussed the War  keenly and thoughtfully with my companion. He had two brothers in  German East, I knew, and he was soon asking me about them. But  our paths up that way had not converged. I could only tell him by  hearsay about the main advance, wherein they had been sharing,  and I had not. As I told, a dark handsome, gentle-voiced woman  brought our coffee out. Soon a shy little girl put her head round  the corner of the stoep, and withdrew' it again. I jumped down to  greet her. Then she agreed to come and shake hands with us both.  Her father colored up, and smiled as he told me of a great  scheme. A lady in town had offered to board this child. So kind,  wasn't it? She was of sturdy English make (her father's father  was an Essex man. I had been told). Her hair and eyes were very  dark; she looked ever so capable.    'Yes, very kind,' I murmured, but I was reflecting that the  lady's kindness might not be so very ill-rewarded. The child  might prove useful and cost little. She might give the sort of  help that is apt to be useful and costly in a country like ours.  'Yes,' said the father smiling, 'and she may get to the day  school that way, the lady says. We couldn't have nearly afforded  to send her into town otherwise. But now she's got her chance of  a regular school.' 'Oh, really,' said my friend. His kind ugly  face looked none too pleasant as he said it, I remember noticing  that.    Then he went to his mules to 'buckle' up a strap somewhere. I was  surprised to hear him cursing something under his breath. It was  not his manner, I thought, to curse straps or mules. We said  good-bye a very cordial one and then drove down towards the main  road. It winds through a vlei towards the town. We had got almost  to the big water-course so banked up in thirsty sand, when he  told me what he was cursing. He repeated his words deliberately:  'Damn it, damn it to hell,' he said. I protested faintly till he  made it clear to me what he was damning, then I recklessly  endorsed his damnation. For he was not cursing Heaven or  humanity; he was cursing that blessed Anglo-Dutch, or rather  Dutch-English, institution of South Africa, the color-bar. He had  been told by one of the managers that should the father apply for  admission to school on behalf of the child we had seen, he would  be certainly refused. The father was really much too poor to send  her away, he told me.    'They're ever so honest and hard-worked. They've put up a great  fight on mealie meal against bad seasons. They've pinched hard  for the child's poor little outfit. He's got into debt for it.  He's a Britisher, and has got two brothers fighting. Very  dubious, dark children have been admitted already, as presumably  Dutch. Dutch and colonials rule the roost here. And to leave  Christianity alone, where does British Imperialism come in? It's  risking spoiling a life, and the life of such a decent kid.'    Thereat he certainly condemned guiltily, as he should not have  condemned, Dutchmen and colonials, their churches, their social  order, and their sanctimony. 'Thank God I was at plebeian  Oxford,' he said, 'and was free to mix with colored men. This is  far more select, this dorp academy, with its elect Principal and  its supermen-managers.' We nearly had a row about his language.    We came over a rolling down towards the commonage. 'They've kept  free from fires here,' I said. 'Yes,' he said, 'but I'm doubtful  if their vigilance pays, if their game's worth the candle. I mean  if such absence of illumination is worth all their watching  about.' 'It saves waste of life.' I said, 'animal and vegetable,  if you can only keep the fires away.' I appealed to the wisdom of  our laws as well as to the argument of mercy which I appealed to  me. 'And you get that sort of thing.' he said, pointing to the  thick brown tufts of unappetizing feed. 'That's been going more  than a year, hasn't it? 'Oh for a wind and a fire,' say I.    We passed over the commonage, which showed very black with recent  fires. 'It looks rather knocked out,' I said. 'Yet not without  hope,' he answered. We were driving back about the same time next  fore-noon. A great fire was rushing wind-driven over that rolling  upland. 'At last,' he said. I sighed. A mile further on we came  into the smiling green vlei. 'This was black a while back,' he  said. 'Doesn't the fire help a bit after all? Who wants that  moldy stuffy old feed, isn't it parabolic of that fusty Dutch-Anglo  dorp and its prejudices? What are they meant for, and it?  'Fuel of fire,' say I.' I smiled indulgently. Since we had got  into town things had happened. We had had our memorial services  for the Dead that last night, and this same morning. It was the  week of All Hallows and All Souls, a time that often tempts me to  homesickness. One is apt to think of hazy, yellow-leaved, dreamy  times in old England just about then not to speak of old familiar  faces. That night of the first Service was very starry, and the  morning of the second Service was brilliantly clear, the rain  seemed to be very far away for the time being. People had come at  night rather well. Not to speak of one of the school managers  having died quite recently, news of one of our police's death out  scouting had leaked through from German East. I preached Paradise  to that attentive congregation in the iron-roofed church that  natives had been so discouraged from attending. I was glad one  straggled into the back seats I had battled for, just to  demonstrate one's principle of barring out the color-bar. It was  all very soul-soothing, thought I, that Memorial Evensong, the  stars outside, and the golden evening brightening in the west of  the hymn, and the lesson about white robes and palms, presumably  of victory or harvest-homing. My friend waited for me outside  under the lamp. 'Very fine,' he said in his grimmest way, 'the  Anglican view of hopeful souls turned promiscuously into a sort  of orchard and rose-garden with plenty of light to gild them, and  rest to wrap them.' I smiled. 'True enough in its way,' I said.  'There's another side doubtless, yet the preaching of that  doesn't appeal to me particularly. I don't want to work on  people's apprehensions. But don't let me stand in your light.  You're a lay reader with a bishop's license. You can preach and  welcome to-morrow morning.' 'Trust me not to refuse,' he said. 'I  don't want to play up to apprehensions exactly. I want to state  what seem to me to be relentless laws of cause and effect, and to  show the only way with any sort of hope in Christ that I happen  by faith to see.' So he had preached that morning. He preached  quite simply on the trying of every man's work, on the burning of  flimsy work, on the saving of the workman, yet so as by fire.  There was a small but select gathering in the Church of Saint  Tertullian; two of the school managers even were there. Surely I  had baited the trap, I thought guiltily as I looked upon them,  by my over-amiabilities of the night before.    Yet that side was true enough, the side I had preached. And was  not this side also true in its way? The preacher seemed at first  to be referring to my own obsession with the words 'resist not  evil,' my following of Tolstoy in my own evangel. He was warm in  his commendation. 'And yet,' he said, 'let us remember a just  God's resistance to evil. He resists and judges righteously,  where we may neither resist nor judge. If we agree not to resist  evil violently for Jesus' sake, yet ought we not to warn people  of their God's unrelenting resistance? While we would not obscure  the fear of our just God by the fear of us unjust men, let us  remember our just God!' He spoke of judgment and of purgation, of  what seemed to be indicated hereafter by the stupidity and  cruelty of people's prejudices in South Africa. He painted quite  luridly the purgation he anticipated as likely for such as would  dare to wreck a child's education, and possibly her life for a  color-scruple. He glowed and kindled. There was no mistaking his  drift. He painted the fires of purgation. He painted, too, their  presumable fuel, much as I believe old preachers limned the  flames of hell and their denizens. 'And it may lengthen out into  hell! Who knows?' he kept interjecting. 'Who knows but that that  prejudiced spirit you play with may be a damned spirit after all,  fuel for the fire that is not quenched, food for the worm that  does not die?'    T could not have preached happily on his lines, but for all that  I acknowledged that the thing might well be of God this bizarre  surprise at his preaching that was glassed in at least two of his  listeners' eyes. Did that sermon do any good? Let me anticipate!  The child came into town as a half-time servant. Somebody's"]]]
