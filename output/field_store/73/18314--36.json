Whether it entered into the  calculation of the eldest that she might be able to pick and choose a  husband from the number of young men who were certain to be on the shore  with speaking-trumpets to beg her to marry them, I do not pretend to  say, but it was then the case as now,--no girl could remain in the  colony without being asked to wed every day in the week till she made  her choice.    Having made up our minds to go, the next thing to be thought of was the  way to accomplish our objects.  Without hesitation, I determined to  perform the voyage in my own vessel.  She was a remarkably good sea  boat, and a fast sailer, and for her size was very roomy.  She was  called by a curious coincidence the _May Flower_, which was the name of  the vessel which carried over the first pilgrim fathers to America; and  certainly, when my vessel was named, I never contemplated attempting to  cross the ocean in her.  Although she was under sixty tons, I considered  that properly handled she was as well calculated to double the Cape as a  far larger vessel, and I felt sure from what I had heard, that if I got  her out safe to the colony she would fetch a high price.  If, however,  she was to be swamped--as my whole family and property would have gone  to the bottom at the same time--there would be no one left behind to  mourn our loss.  I do not mean to say that I for one moment thought we  should be lost, but still I knew that it was possible, and I reconciled  myself to the chance with that reflection.    The first thing I did was to haul up my vessel, and to give her a  thorough repair, then to refit her rigging, and to raise her bulwarks  somewhat, so as to make her snugger.  As she was from the first fitted  so as to be easily handled, her masts were short and very stout; and as  her hull was as strong as wood and iron could make it, she was in every  way suited for a long sea voyage.  As I had made up my mind to attempt  to carry out some sheep, I divided her hold into compartments, one as a  pen, another for hay and water, a third for implements of agriculture,  and a few select goods which I calculated would sell well, and  provisions for ourselves.  In the after part of the vessel were cabins  for my wife, myself, and my daughters, while the boys with the two men  who formed the crew were berthed forward.    Just as my preparations were ready my eldest son returned home from sea,  and delighted he was to find that his next voyage was to be made with  those he loved.    I was fortunate in disposing of my house and the heavier part of my  furniture to advantage, and the remainder I stowed away on board.  It is  extraordinary what number of things the little vessel held.  There were  numerous casks of water, salted meat, potatoes, bread, rice, and many  other sorts of provisions for six or seven months.  I had no wish to be  starved; then there was the hay for the sheep, which I got pressed into  very tight packages in a way since become common, and by the time the  sheep came on board there was not much space to spare, I can assure you.    When all was ready for sea, my wife and I and all my children took a  last farewell of the house where we had lived, and the neighbours we had  known so many years, and we then went to church to pray God for a safe  passage, and as soon as service was over we returned on board, and that  evening dropped down the Thames.  I have not yet said a word about the  sheep, for I did not take them on board till afterwards.  I was  acquainted with a man at Hamburg who understood sheep well, and to him I  had written to buy for me the two finest merino rams he could find, and  four ewes of the same breed.  I calculated that I could not carry hay  and water for more.  We had fine summer weather and a fair wind to carry  us across Channel, and when I put into Hamburg to take the sheep on  board, I found that my friend had not disappointed me; he had in truth  selected six magnificent animals, and I felt certain that if I could  carry them safely to the colony they would fetch a pretty high price.  Having filled up one water-cask, we again put to sea, and were now  fairly on our voyage.    We had a beautiful run down Channel, and indeed from first to last  Providence watched over us, nothing went wrong, and everything prospered  far more than we could have expected.  My wife and daughters turned out  capital sailors, and soon learned to take their turn at the helm, to  relieve my boys and our two men.  Both of these were characters in their  way.  Old Bob Hunt had sailed with me for many years in the coasting  trade, and a trusty hand he was, but he knew no more of the broad seas  than the child unborn, or of geography either; and when I told him that  I was thinking of going out to New Holland, he asked if I expected to  make the place in a week or so, as he supposed it wasn't very far from  Old Holland, where the people speak Dutch.  And when I told him that the  natives were as black as his shoe, and spoke a language no Christian man  could understand, he would scarcely believe me.    \"Never mind,\" he said, after a moment's thought, \"no one shall say I  deserted you because you were bound on a long voyage; if we were to be a  year about getting there I would go with you.  I shall leave behind no  more kith nor kin than you do, so that's settled.\"    Old Bob was a capital seaman, but what is strange, he never touched  liquor, nor smoked, nor over chewed tobacco.  He ate, too, as little as  any man I ever saw at his meals; and as for sleeping, it was difficult  to find him with his eyes shut.  The least noise would awake him, and if  the breeze freshened up a bit he was sure to be on deck in a moment to  see that all was right.  He was a most invaluable hand, and worth any  two other men I ever had.  In spite of his age Bob was active as a  monkey, and short and thin, and so occupied wonderfully little space in  the small craft; which was convenient, as also for another reason, for  his companion, Dick Nailor, was one of the biggest men I ever met, a  perfect giant, but gentle as a lamb, and with an excellent temper.  He  used to say that he and Bob together only took up their fair amount of  room.  If Bob was never seen asleep Dick was seldom found broad awake,  but he was keeping a bright look-out notwithstanding, and when roused up  he was active enough, and strong as a lion.  The children were very fond  of him.  He could take them all up in his arms and dance a hornpipe with  them hanging about him, as lightly as a young lady in satin shoes.    My eldest boy, Peter, named after me, was one of the steadiest fellows I  ever met.  At eighteen he was second officer of a ship, and might have  been entrusted with the command.  I was sorry to take him away from the  line he was following, and yet it was a great thing to have all my  family together.  He wished to come, and did not disappoint my  expectation.    Mark and John, my next boys, were always together, and yet very  different.  Mark was one of the merriest chaps you ever saw, and up to  all sorts of harmless pranks.  John looked like gravity itself, but that  arose from his eyes and the shape of his mouth; give him anything to  laugh at and he would indeed laugh heartily.  Mark was his chief object  of admiration.  He thought no one his equal, yet many people liked John  the most.  He was so humble and gentle, and never thought a thing about  himself.    My eldest girl, Mary, was like her elder brother as to steadiness and  discretion, just what an elder sister should be; so good-natured and  kind, too, it was pleasant to see her standing all the bothering the  young ones gave her without a word of complaint.  It was a valuable  quality in a person who was to be shut up for four or five months in a  small craft with a number of youngsters.  She was next to Peter in age,  and then came Susan, as kind-hearted, industrious a little creature as  ever lived, not very bright, but wanting to do right; and then the two  boys, and then Margaret, a bright-eyed, fair child, such a little dear;  then another boy, Tommy, always in a mess because he didn't know how to  keep out of one; and one more girl, Sarah Ann, and there you have the  whole lot of them; they, with their mother, a good woman if any one ever  deserved the name, with the two men and myself, made up the complement  of the human souls embarked on board the _May Flower_.    Then we had a dog, _Steadfast_, and a cat, _Duchess_, the only thing of  much rank aboard us; two fine cocks and ten hens for laying eggs,  besides a couple of dozen other fowls, to be eaten by my wife and the  girls.  We had a pair of pigeons, a pair of robins and sparrows, and a  hen lark--her mate died just as we were going on board--belonging to  Mark and John.  I don't think we had much else.  Yes, we had some  primrose, violets, snowdrops, daisies, and other roots and small plants,  which took up little space, to remind us of old England.    We sailed in the autumn, so as to arrive in the summer, and to get  housed before the rains set in.  We took our departure from Ashanto, and  shaped a course for Rio Janeiro, in the Brazils, there to take in a  further supply of water and fresh provisions.  Thence I hoped to carry  the trade wind across the Atlantic, and round the Cape, though I thought  it possible that I might have to touch at the Cape, unless we had an  unusually fast run, for water.  You see our little craft couldn't carry  enough for ourselves and the sheep for as long a time as we could have  wished, and yet you may depend on it we wasted none.  I have often  thought of the story of the poor Arab who, wishing to make the caliph  the most valuable present in his power, took him a skin bottle full of  muddy water from the desert.  He, when journeying across the desert  esteemed it of more value than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#4)"],[1,"his belly full  er 'simmons, en Brer Coon, he scoop up a 'bunnunce er frogs en  tadpoles. Dey amble long, dey did, des ez sociable ez a basket er  kittens, twel bimeby dey hear Mr. Dog talkin' ter hisse'f way off  in de woods.    \"'Spozen he runs up on us, Brer Possum, w'at you gwineter do?'  sez Brer Coon, sezee.

'Ef he run up onter me, I lay I give  'im one twis',' sezee.\"    \"Did the dog come?\" asked the little boy.    \"Go 'way, honey!\" responded the old man, in an impressive tone.  \"Go way! Mr. Dog, he come en he come a zoonin'. En he ain't wait  fer ter say howdy, nudder. He des sail inter de two un um. De  ve'y fus pas he make Brer Possum fetch a grin fum year ter year,  en keel over like he wuz dead.

You better b'leeve dat w'en Mr. Dog got a  chance to make hisse'f skase he tuck it, en w'at der wuz lef' un  him went skaddlin' thoo de woods like hit wuz shot outen a  muskit. En Brer Coon, he sorter lick his cloze inter shape en  rack off, en Brer Possum, he lay dar like he wuz dead, twel  bimeby he raise up sorter keerful like, en w'en he fine de coas'  cle'r he scramble up en scamper off like sumpin' was atter 'im.\"    Here Uncle Remus paused long enough to pick up a live coal of  fire in his fingers, transfer it to the palm of his hand, and  thence to his clay pipe, which he had been filling--a proceeding  that was viewed by the little boy with undisguised admiration.  The old man then proceeded:    \"Nex' time Brer Possum met Brer Coon, Brer Coon 'fuse ter 'spon'  ter his howdy, en dis make Brer Possum feel mighty bad, seein' ez  how dey useter make so many 'scurshuns tergedder.    \"'W'at make you hol' yo' head so high, Brer Coon?' sez Brer  Possum, sezee.    \"'I ain't runnin' wid cowerds deze days,' sez Brer Coon. 'W'en I  wants you I'll sen' fer you,' sezee.    \"Den Brer Possum git mighty mad.    \"'Who's enny cowerd?' sezee.    \"'You is,' sez Brer Coon, 'dat's who.

'W'y I want no mo 'feared dan you is dis minnit. W'at wuz  dey fer ter be skeered un?' sezee.

Git me in a row whar dey ain't no  ticklin' 'lowed, en I'm your man, sezee.    \"En down ter dis day\"--continued Uncle Remus, watching the  smoke from his pipe curl upward over the little boy's head--\"down  ter dis day, Brer Possum's bound ter s'render w'en you tech him  in de short ribs, en he'll laugh ef he knows he's gwineter be  smashed fer it.\"      IV. HOW MR. RABBIT WAS TOO SHARP FOR MR. FOX    \"UNCLE REMUS,\" said the little boy one evening, when he had  found the old man with little or nothing to do, \"did the fox kill  and eat the rabbit when he caught him with the Tar-Baby?\"    \"Law, honey, ain't I tell you 'bout dat?\" replied the old darkey,  chuckling slyly. \"I 'clar ter grashus I ought er tole you dat,  but old man Nod wuz ridin' on my eyeleds 'twel a leetle mo'n I'd  a dis'member'd my own name, en den on to dat here come yo mammy  hollerin' atter you.    \"W'at I tell you w'en I fus' begin? I tole you Brer Rabbit wuz a  monstus soon creetur; leas'ways dat's w'at I laid out fer ter  tell you. Well, den, honey, don't you go en make no udder  calkalashuns, kaze in dem days Brer Rabbit en his fambly wuz at  de head er de gang w'en enny racket wuz on han', en dar dey  stayed. 'Fo' you begins fer ter wipe yo' eyes 'bout Brer Rabbit,  you wait en see whar'bouts Brer Rabbit gwineter fetch up at. But  dat's needer yer ner dar.    \"W'en Brer Fox fine Brer Rabbit mixt up wid de Tar-Baby, he feel  mighty good, en he roll on de groun' en laff. Bimeby he up'n say,  sezee:    \"'Well, I speck I got you dis time, Brer Rabbit, sezee; 'maybe I  ain't, but I speck I is. You been runnin' roun' here sassin'  atter me a mighty long time, but I speck you done come ter de  een' er de row.

Nobody in de roun' worl'. You des tuck en jam  yo'se'f on dat Tar-Baby widout waitin' fer enny invite,' sez Brer  Fox, sezee, en dar you is, en dar you'll stay twel I fixes up a  bresh-pile and fires her up, kaze I'm gwineter bobby-cue you dis  day, sho,' sez Brer Fox, sezee.    \"Den Brer Rabbit talk mighty 'umble.    \"'I don't keer w'at you do wid me, Brer Fox,' sezee, 'so you  don't fling me in dat brier-patch. Roas' me, Brer Fox' sezee,  'but don't fling me in dat brierpatch,' sezee.    \"'Hit's so much trouble fer ter kindle a fier,' sez Brer Fox,  sezee, 'dat I speck I'll hatter hang you,' sezee.    \"'Hang me des ez high as you please, Brer Fox,' sez Brer Rabbit,  sezee, 'but do fer de Lord's sake don't fling me in dat brier-  patch,' sezee.    \"'I ain't got no string,' sez Brer Fox, sezee, 'en now I speck  I'll hatter drown you,' sezee.    \"'Drown me des ez deep ez you please, Brer Fox,' sez Brer Rabbit,  sezee, 'but do don't fling me in dat brier-patch,' sezee.    \"'Dey ain't no water nigh,' sez Brer Fox, sezee, 'en now I speck  I'll hatter skin you,' sezee.    \"'Skin me, Brer Fox,' sez Brer Rabbit, sezee, 'snatch out my  eyeballs, t'ar out my years by de roots, en cut off my legs,'  sezee, 'but do please, Brer Fox, don't fling me in dat brier-  patch,' sezee.    \"Co'se Brer Fox wanter hurt Brer Rabbit bad ez he kin, so he  cotch 'im by de behime legs en slung 'im right in de middle er de  brier-patch. Dar wuz a considerbul flutter whar Brer Rabbit  struck de bushes, en Brer Fox sorter hang 'roun' fer ter see w'at  wuz gwineter happen. Bimeby he hear somebody call 'im, en way up  de hill he see Brer Rabbit settin' crosslegged on a chinkapin log  koamin' de pitch outen his har wid a chip. Den Brer Fox know dat  he bin swop off mighty bad. Brer Rabbit wuz bleedzed fer ter  fling back some er his sass, en he holler out:    \"'Bred en bawn in a brier-patch, Brer Fox--bred en bawn in a  brier-patch!' en wid dat he skip out des ez lively ez a cricket  in de embers.\"      V.  THE STORY OF THE DELUGE AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT    \"ONE time,\" said Uncle Remus--adjusting his spectacles so as to  be able to see how to thread a large darning-needle with which he  was patching his coat--\"one time, way back yander, 'fo' you wuz  bomed, honey, en 'fo' Mars John er Miss Sally wuz bomed--way back  yander 'fo' enny un us wuz bomed, de animils en de creeturs  sorter 'lecshuneer roun' 'mong deyselves, twel at las' dey 'greed  fer ter have a 'sembly. In dem days,\" continued the old man,  observing a look of incredulity on the little boy's face, \"in dem  days creeturs had lots mo' sense dan dey got now; let 'lone dat,  dey had sense same like folks. Hit was tech en go wid um, too,  mon, en w'en dey make up der mines w'at hatter be done, 'twant  mo'n menshun'd 'fo, hit wuz done. Well, dey 'lected dat dey  hatter hol' er 'sembly fer ter sorter straighten out marters en  hear de complaints, en w'en de day come dey wuz on han'. De Lion,  he wuz dar, kase he wuz de king, en he hatter be der. De  Rhynossyhoss, he wuz dar, en de Elephant, he wuz dar, en de  Cammils, en de Cows, en plum' down ter de Crawfishes, dey wuz  dar. Dey wuz all dar. En w'en de Lion shuck his mane, en tuck his  seat in de big cheer, den de sesshun begun fer ter commence.    \"What did they do, Uncle Remus?\" asked the little boy.    \"I can't skacely call to mine 'zackly w'at dey did do, but dey  spoke speeches, en hollered, en cusst, en flung der langwidge  'roun' des like w'en yo' daddy wuz gwineter run fer de legislater  en got lef'. Howsomever, dey 'ranged der 'fairs, en splained der  bizness. Bimeby, w'ile dey wuz 'sputin' 'longer one er nudder, de  Elephant trompled on one er de Crawfishes.
