And I may add that frequent intercourse for  nearly forty years, and close official relations for more than ten, only  deepened and confirmed the impressions first made. A more familiar  acquaintance with his domestic, social, and religious life, a more  thorough knowledge of his mind and heart, constantly increased my  appreciation of his worth, my esteem for his character, and my affection  for his person.    Not a few misunderstood, undervalued, or misrepresented his public  conduct, but it will be found that those who knew him best, loved him  most, and that many who were constrained to differ from him, in his  management of public affairs, did full justice to the purity and  generosity of his motives, to the nobility, loftiness, and ultimate  success of his aims, and to the disinterestedness and value of his  varied and manifold labours for the country, and for the Church of  Christ.    As a _teacher_, he was earnest and efficient, eloquent and inspiring,  but he expected and exacted rather too much work from the average  student. His own ready and affluent mind sympathized keenly with the  apt, bright scholar, to whom his praise was warmly given, but he  scarcely made sufficient allowance for the dullness or lack of previous  preparation which failed to keep pace with him in his long and rapid  strides; hence his censures were occasionally severe. His methods of  examination furnished the very best kind of mental discipline, fitted  alike to cultivate the memory and to strengthen the judgment. All the  students revered him, but the best of the class appreciated him most.  His counsels were faithful and judicious; his admonitions paternal and  discriminating; his rebukes seldom administered, but scathingly severe.  No student ever left his presence, without resolving to do better, to  aim higher, and to win his approval.    His acceptance of the office of Chief Superintendent of Education, while  offering to him the sphere of his life's work, and giving to the country  the very service it needed--_the man for the place_--was a severe trial  to the still struggling College, and a bitter disappointment to some  young, ambitious hearts.    Into this new arena he entered with a resolute determination to succeed,  and he spared no pains, effort, or sacrifice to fit himself thoroughly  for the onerous duties of the office to which he had been appointed. Of  its nature, importance, and far-reaching results, he had a distinct,  vivid perception, and clearly realized and fully felt the  responsibilities it imposed. He steadfastly prosecuted his work with a  firm, inflexible will, unrelaxing tenacity of purpose, an amazing  fertility of expedient, an exhaustless amount of information, a most  wonderful skill in adaptation, a matchless ability in unfolding and  vindicating his plans, a rare adroitness in meeting and removing  difficulties--great moderation in success, and indomitable perseverance  under discouragement, calm patience when misapprehended, unflinching  courage when opposed,--until he achieved the consummation of his wishes,  the establishment of a system of public education second to none in its  efficiency and adaptation to the condition and circumstances of the  people. The system is a noble monument to the singleness of purpose, the  unwavering devotion, the tireless energy, the eminent ability, and the  administrative powers of Dr. Ryerson, and it will render his name a  familiar word for many generations in Canadian schools and homes; and  place him high in the list of the great men of other lands,  distinguished in the same field of labour. His entire administration of  the Department of Public Instruction was patient and prudent, vigorous  and vigilant, sagacious and successful.    He repeatedly visited Europe, not for mere recreation or personal  advantage, but for the advancement of the interests of religion and  education in the Province. During these tours, there were opened to him  the most extended fields of observation and enquiry, from which he  gathered ample stores of information which he speedily rendered  available for the perfecting, as far as practicable, the entire system  of Public Instruction.    A prominent figure in Canadian history for three score years, actively  and ceaselessly engaged in almost every department of patriotic and  philanthropic, Christian and literary, enterprise, Dr. Ryerson was a  strong tower in support or defence of every good cause, and no such  cause failed to secure the powerful aid of his advocacy by voice and  pen. His was truly a catholic and charitable spirit. Nothing human was  alien to him. A friend of all good men, he enjoyed the confidence and  esteem of all, even of those whose opinions or policy on public  questions he felt constrained to refute or oppose. He commanded the  respect, and secured the friendship of men of every rank, and creed, and  party. None could better appreciate his ability and magnanimity than  those who encountered him as an opponent, or were compelled to  acknowledge him as victor. His convictions were strong, his principles  firm, his purposes resolute, and he could, and did maintain them, with  chivalrous daring, against any and every assault.    In the heat of controversy, while repelling unworthy insinuations, his  indignation was sometimes roused, and his language not unfrequently was  fervid, and forcible, and scathingly severe, but seldom, if ever,  personally rancorous or bitter. When violently or vilely assailed his  sensitive nature keenly felt the wound, but though he earned many a  scar, he bore no malice.    _His intellectual powers_, of a high order, admirably balanced, and  invigorated by long and severe discipline, found their expression in  word and work, by pulpit, press, and platform, in the achievements of  self-denying, indefatigable industry, and in wise and lofty  statesmanship.    _His moral nature_ was elevated and pure. He was generous, sympathetic,  benevolent, faithful, trusting, and trustworthy. He rejoiced sincerely  in the weal, and deeply felt the woes of others, and his ready hand  obeyed the dictates of his loving, liberal heart.    _His religious life_ was marked by humility, consistency, and  cheerfulness. The simplicity of his faith in advanced life was  childlike, and sublime. His trust in God never faltered, and, at the end  of his course, his hopes of eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord,  were radiant and triumphant.    Dr. Ryerson was truly a great man, endowed with grand qualities of mind  and heart, which he consecrated to high and holy aims; and though, in  early life, and in his public career, beset with many difficulties, he  heroically achieved for himself, among his own people, a most enviable  renown. His work and his worth universally appreciated, his influence  widely acknowledged, his services highly valued, his name a household  word throughout the Dominion, and his memory a legacy and an  inspiration to future generations.    And while Canada owes more to him than any other of her sons, his fame  is not confined to the land of his birth, which he loved so well, and  served so faithfully, but in Britain and in the United States of America  his name is well known, and is classed with their own deserving  worthies.    Whatever judgment may be formed of some parts of his eventful and  distinguished career as a public man, there can be but one opinion as to  the eminent and valuable services he has rendered to his country, as a  laborious, celebrated pioneer preacher, an able ecclesiastical leader, a  valiant and veteran advocate of civil and religious liberty--as the  founder and administrator of a system of public education second to that  of no other land--as the President and life-long patron of Victoria  University, _whose oldest living alumnus_ will hold his memory dear to  life's close, when severed friends will be reunited; and whose  successive classes will revere as the first President and firm friend of  their Alma Mater, as the promoter of popular education, the ally of all  teachers, and an example to all young men.    I lay this simple wreath on the memorial of one, whom I found able and  helpful as _a teacher_ in my youth--wise and prudent as _an adviser_ in  after life--generous and considerate as _a superior officer_--tender and  true as a _friend_. He loved me, and was beloved by me. He doubtless had  his faults, but I cannot recall them; and very few, I venture to think,  will ever seek to mention them. The green turf which rests on his grave  covers them. His memory will live as one of the purest, kindest, best of  men. A patriot, a scholar, a Christian--the servant of God, the friend  of man.        \"Amicum perdere est damnorum maximum.\"    Yours, very faithfully, in bonds of truest friendship,    W. Ormiston.    To J. George Hodgins, Esq., LL.D., Toronto          THE STORY OF MY LIFE.          CHAPTER I.    1803-1825.    Sketch of Early Life.      I have several times been importuned to furnish a sketch of my life for  books of biography of public men, published both in Canada and the  United States; but I have uniformly declined, assigning as a reason a  wish to have nothing of the kind published during my lifetime. Finding,  however, that some circumstances connected with my early history have  been misapprehended and misrepresented by adversaries, and that my  friends are anxious that I should furnish some information on the  subject, and being now in the seventieth year of my age, I sit down in  this my Long Point Island Cottage, retired from the busy world, to give  some account of my early life, on this blessed Sabbath day, indebted to  the God of the Sabbath for all that I am,--morally, intellectually, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#4)"],[1,"azement, upon the threshold. In the ruinous  apartment, which was now but dimly lighted through a grated window, he  saw a huge screech-owl sitting on the floor. Big tears rolled down  from her large round eyes, and with ardent voice she sent her cries  forth from her crooked bill. As soon, however, as she espied the  Caliph and his Vizier, who meanwhile had crept softly up behind, she  raised a loud cry of joy. She neatly wiped away the tears with her  brown-striped wing, and to the great astonishment of both, exclaimed,  in good human Arabic,--    \"Welcome to you, storks! you are to me a good omen of deliverance,  for it was once prophesied to me that, through storks, a great piece  of good fortune is to fall to my lot.\"    When the Caliph recovered from his amazement, he bowed his long neck,  brought his slender feet into an elegant position, and said:  \"Screech-owl, after your words, I venture to believe that I see in you  a companion in misfortune. But, alas! this hope that through us thy  deliverance will take place, is groundless. Thou wilt, thyself,  realize our helplessness, when thou hearest our history.\"    The Screech-owl entreated him to impart it to her, and the Caliph,  raising himself up, related what we already know.          CHAPTER IV.      When the Caliph had told his history to the owl, she thanked him, and  said: \"Listen to my story, also, and hear how I am no less unfortunate  than thyself. My father is the king of India; I, his only, unfortunate  daughter, am called Lusa. That same sorcerer Kaschnur, who transformed  you, has plunged me also in this affliction. He came, one day, to my  father, and asked me in marriage for his son Mizra. My father,  however, who is a passionate man, cast him down the steps. The wretch  managed to creep up to me again under another form, and as I was on  one occasion taking the fresh air in my garden, clad as a slave, he  presented me a potion which changed me into this detestable figure. He  brought me hither, swooning through fear, and exclaimed in my ear with  awful voice, 'There shalt thou remain, frightful one, despised even by  beasts, until thy death, or till one, of his own free will, even  under this execrable form, take thee to wife. Thus revenge I myself  upon thee, and thy haughty father!'    \"Since then, many months have elapsed; alone and mournfully I live,  like a hermit, in these walls, abhorred by the world, an abomination  even to brutes. Beautiful nature is shut out from me; for I am blind  by day, and only when the moon sheds her wan light upon this ruin,  falls the shrouding veil from mine eye.\"    The owl ended, and again wiped her eyes with her wing, for the  narration of her wo had called forth tears. The Caliph was plunged in  deep meditation by the story of the Princess. \"If I am not altogether  deceived,\" said he, \"you will find that between our misfortunes a  secret connection exists; but where can I find the key to this  enigma?\"    The owl answered him, \"My lord! this also is plain to me; for once, in  early youth, it was foretold to me by a wise woman, that a stork would  bring me great happiness, and perhaps I might know how we may save  ourselves.\"    The Caliph was much astonished, and inquired in what way she meant.    \"The enchanter who has made us both miserable,\" said she, \"comes once  every month to these ruins. Not far from this chamber is a hall;  there, with many confederates, he is wont to banquet. Already I have  often watched them: they relate to one another their shameful  deeds--perhaps he might then mention the magic word which you have  forgotten.\"    \"Oh, dearest Princess!\" exclaimed the Caliph: \"tell us--when will he  come, and where is the hall?\"    The owl was silent a moment, and then said: \"Take it not unkindly, but  only on one condition can I grant your wish.\"    \"Speak out! speak out!\" cried Chasid. \"Command; whatever it may be, I  am ready to obey.\"    \"It is this: I would fain at the same time be free; this, however, can  only take place, if one of you offer me his hand.\" At this proposition  the storks seemed somewhat surprised, and the Caliph beckoned to his  attendant to step aside with him a moment. \"Grand-Vizier,\" said the  Caliph before the door, \"this is a stupid affair, but you can set it  all right.\"    \"Thus?\" rejoined he; \"that my wife, when I go home, may scratch my  eyes out? Besides, I am an old man, while you are still young and  unmarried, and can better give your hand to a young and beautiful  princess.\"    \"Ah! that is the point,\" sighed the Caliph, as he mournfully drooped  his wings: \"who told you she is young and fair? That is equivalent to  buying a cat in a sack!\" They continued to converse together for a  long time, but finally, when the Caliph saw that Mansor would rather  remain a stork than marry the owl, he determined sooner, himself, to  accept the condition. The owl was overjoyed; she avowed to them that  they could have come at no better time, since, probably, that very  night, the sorcerers would assemble together.    She left the apartment with the storks, in order to lead them to the  saloon; they went a long way through a gloomy passage, until at last a  very bright light streamed upon them through a half-decayed wall. When  they reached this place, the owl advised them to halt very quietly.  From the breach, near which they were standing, they could look down  upon a large saloon, adorned all around with pillars, and splendidly  decorated, in which many colored lamps restored the light of day. In  the midst of the saloon stood a round table, laden with various choice  meats. Around the table extended a sofa, on which eight men were  seated. In one of these men the storks recognised the very merchant,  who had sold them the magic powder. His neighbor desired him to tell  them his latest exploits; whereupon he related, among others, the  story of the Caliph and his Vizier.    \"What did you give them for a word?\" inquired of him one of the other  magicians.    \"A right ponderous Latin one--MUTABOR.\"          CHAPTER V.      When the storks heard this through their chasm in the wall, they  became almost beside themselves with joy. They ran so quickly with  their long feet to the door of the ruin, that the owl could scarcely  keep up with them. Thereupon spoke the Caliph to her: \"Preserver of my  life and that of my friend, in token of our eternal thanks for what  thou hast done for us, take me as thy husband.\" Then he turned to the  East: three times they bowed their long necks towards the sun, which  was even now rising above the mountains, and at the same moment  exclaimed \"MUTABOR!\" In a twinkling they were restored, and in the  excessive joy of their newly-bestowed life, alternately laughing and  weeping, were folded in each other's arms. But who can describe their  astonishment when they looked around? A beautiful woman, attired as a  queen, stood before them. Smiling, she gave the Caliph her hand, and  said, \"Know you your screech-owl no longer?\" It was she; the Caliph  was in such transports at her beauty and pleasantness, as to cry out,  that it was the most fortunate moment in his life, when he became a  stork.    The three now proceeded together to Bagdad. The Caliph found in his  dress, not only the box of magic powder, but also his money-bag. By  means thereof, he purchased at the nearest village what was necessary  for their journey, and accordingly they soon appeared before the gates  of the city. Here, however, the arrival of the Caliph excited great  astonishment. They had given out that he was dead, and the people were  therefore highly rejoiced to have again their beloved lord.    So much the more, however, burned their hatred against the impostor  Mizra. They proceeded to the palace, and caught the old magician and  his son. The old man the Caliph sent to the same chamber in the ruin,  which the princess, as a screech-owl, had inhabited, and there had  him hung; unto the son, however, who understood nothing of his  father's arts, he gave his choice,--to die, or snuff some of the  powder. Having chosen the latter, the Grand-Vizier presented him the  box. A hearty pinch, and the magic word of the Caliph converted him  into a stork. Chasid had him locked up in an iron cage, and hung in  his garden.    Long and happily lived Caliph Chasid with his spouse, the Princess;  his pleasantest hours were always those, when in the afternoon the  Vizier sought him; and whenever the Caliph was in a very good humor,  he would let himself down so far, as to show Mansor how he looked,  when a stork. He would gravely march along, with rigid feet, up and  down the chamber, make a clattering noise, wave his arms like wings,  and show how, in vain, he had prostrated himself to the East, and  cried out, MU--MU. To the Princess and her children, this imitation  always afforded great amusement: when, however, the Caliph clattered,  and bowed, and cried out, too long, then the Vizier would threaten him  that he would disclose to his spouse what had been proposed outside  the door of the Princess Screech-owl!

They rode almost all the night long, for it was refreshing and  starry, whereas the day was sultry. At last they arrived at a  convenient stopping-place; here they pitched their tents, and composed  themselves to rest. To the stranger the merchants attended, as a most  valued guest.
