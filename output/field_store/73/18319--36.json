[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#4)"],[1," not express her meaning clearly,  and reconstruction seemed necessary, no change was made. Singularly,  this was the case in the first sentence of the first letter.        I can easily imagine, dear M., the look of large wonder which      gleams from your astonished eyes when they fall upon the date of      this letter.    M. could be astonished but once, but the language used conveys the idea  of wonder arising each time the letter is read; then, again, it is the  place-name, and not the date, that is to cause wonder to gleam from  astonished eyes, as the context shows.    Where reconstruction was not needed to make the meaning clear, and this  could be done by the insertion of a word or phrase, or by some other  simple emendation, changes were generally made. The extract (post, p.  11) following is printed just as it appeared in the Pioneer.        As a frame to the graceful picture, on one side rose the Buttes,      that group of hills so piquant and saucy; and on the other tossing      to Heaven the everlasting whiteness of their snow wreathed      foreheads, stood, sublime in their very monotony, the glorious      Sierra Nevada.    Besides changes in capitalization and punctuation, the words, \"the  summits of,\" are inserted before \"the glorious Sierra.\" Compare Bret  Harte's lines,--        Above the pines the moon was slowly drifting,        The river sang below;      The dim Sierras, far beyond, uplifting        Their minarets of snow.    By the word \"Sierras\" the mountain-range called the Sierra Nevada is  not meant, but merely teeth-like summits thereof, which uplift their  snow-clad peaks, or \"minarets.\" The Spanish word \"sierra\" means, in  English, a saw, and also a ridge of mountains and craggy rocks.  \"Nevada\" means here, in connection with \"Sierra,\" snowy. Thus, \"the  snowy ridge of mountains and craggy rocks,\" or, to express the meaning  more clearly in English, the snowy serrated mountain-range. Bret  Harte's capitalization of \"Sierras\" may be safely challenged. The lines  are from his poem, Dickens in Camp.    The Buttes mentioned by Shirley are the Marysville Buttes. \"Butte\" is  French, and descriptive, and French trappers bestowed the name.    Shirley sometimes uses an adverb instead of an adjective. Thus on page  332, speaking of a tame frog on the bar at a rancho, she says,--        You cannot think how comically [comic] it looked hopping about the      bar, quite as much at home as a tame squirrel would have been.    An old San Francisco printer once heard a newspaperman say that this  little incident furnished the suggestion to Mark Twain for his Jumping  Frog of Calaveras, but, unfortunately, regarded the remark as of no  more importance than much other gossip current among printers and  newspapermen.    Shirley, like many another writer, used marks of quotation improperly,  when the language of the author cited was altered or adapted. Worse  than this are many instances of gross misquotation. In the former case,  the quotation-marks were deleted; in the latter, accuracy was the aim.    On page 79 quotation-marks are deleted, the language used being  adapted, thus, \"clothe themselves with curses as with a garment.\"  Compare Psalms cix, 18, \"He clothed himself with cursing like as with  his garment.\"    On page 101 a correction is made; thus, \"As thy day is, so shall thy  strength be\" (Deut. xxxiii, 25). In the Letters this read, \"As thy  days, so,\" etc.    On page 268 quotation-marks are deleted, as the language used is  adapted, and in a strict sense is also inaccurate; thus, \"The _woman_  tempted me, and I did eat.\" Compare Genesis iii, 12, 13.        12. And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she      gave me of the tree, and _I_ did eat.        13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou      hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did      eat.    Blunders and mistakes of all sorts might be set out, but it is not  deemed advisable to pursue this matter any further. It is, however,  necessary to say something further of THE PIONEER itself, and the  paper-cover title of the May, 1855, number is reprinted here, with an  outline drawing of the crude woodcut vignette printed in the original.  It was impossible to secure a satisfactory facsimile of the title. The  names of some of the agents of the magazine are of historical interest.          _The_ PIONEER    _or_    California Monthly Magazine      [Illustration]        _May, 1855_      SAN FRANCISCO  PUBLISHED _by_ LE COUNT & STRONG  Nos. 111 & 113 MONTGOMERY STREET    _For_ SALE _at all the_ BOOKSTORES _in the_ CITY    AGENTS    J.

Odd numbers  are sometimes found, but these are generally in a mutilated condition,  while the bound volumes lack the advertisements.    The first number was issued in January, 1854, and the last in December,  1855. The first letter of the Shirley series appeared in the initial  number, and the last one in the final issue. The magazine seems to have  been well received in the East, and the Eastern magazines reviewed it  very favorably.    Of Shirley herself it is not necessary to say much in this Foreword.  She was a typical Massachusetts girl, although born in New Jersey, the  residence of the family in the latter state being merely temporary, as  is clearly shown by her correspondence. A letter from Miss Katherine  Powell, librarian of the Amherst Town Library, sheds some light on the  early associations of Shirley. In part, she says,--        In spite of widespread inquiries, I have been able to get ... [but      little] concerning Louise Amelia Knapp Smith. There are no people      now living here who knew her even by hearsay. The records of      Amherst Academy show that she attended that institution in 1839 and      1840.... Miss Smith's name adds another to the long list of writers      who have lived here at one time or another, and Amherst Academy has      added many names to that list. Two of them--Emily Dickinson the      poet, and Emily Fowler Ford--were schoolmates of Miss Smith. Mrs.      Ford was the granddaughter of Noah Webster (an Amherst man [one of      the founders of Amherst College]) and daughter of Professor Fowler      [the phrenologist], who wrote several books. Eugene Field was, some      years later, a student of the old Academy, and in his poem, My      Playmates, he mentioned by their real names a number of his old      schoolmates. Helen Hunt Jackson was a contemporary of Miss Smith      here, and, although she did not attend the Academy, must have been      well known to her.    Amherst, it should be said, was the home-town of Shirley's family, and  to it she often fondly refers in the Letters. It is not cause for  wonder that she is not now remembered in Amherst. Her correspondence  shows that the members of the family, although devotedly attached to  one another, were inclined to disperse.    Mrs. Mary Viola Tingley Lawrence has kindly permitted the printing in  this volume of a paper prepared by her to be read before a literary  society, containing much that is interesting of Shirley's life. Mrs.  Lawrence is well known among the _literati_ of San Francisco. She was a  contributor to the old Overland. What is of more interest here is the  fact that she was a favorite pupil of Shirley, and later her most  intimate friend in California. It was from a selection of poetry  gathered by Mrs. Lawrence that Bret Harte obtained the larger portion  of his selection entitled \"Outcroppings\" (San Francisco, 1866), a  title, by the way, claimed by Mrs. Lawrence as her own.    Rich Bar and Indian Bar, in Butte County at the time the Shirley  Letters were written, are now in Plumas County, consequent upon a  change of the county boundary lines. There are two Rich Bars on the  Feather River, the minor one being on the Middle Fork, and oftentimes  mistaken for the one made famous by Shirley. James Graham Fair, one of  the earliest multimillionaires of California, and United States Senator  from Nevada, panned out his first sackful of gold at Rich Bar, and  probably at the time Shirley was writing her Letters. Many other men,  whose names are familiar to Californians, also delved into the earth at  this historic spot, which is now, in railroad \"literature,\" called  \"Rich.\" Like many another California clipped place-name, the new name  has not the glamour of the old, which, in the words of Shirley, was \"a  most taking name.\"    In closing this Foreword, the printer desires to emphasize the fact  that the typesetting and presswork of this book are entirely his own  work. No one acquainted with the methods employed in a legitimate  book-printing house will fail to recognize the fact that it is well  nigh impossible to print a _book_ without possession of the minute  technical knowledge essential in each department. Hence the most  skillful book-printer is distrustful of himself, unless supported by  experienced craftsmen, and more especially by time-tried proof-readers.  For many favors extended while the Letters were in press, thanks are  due, and are now acknowledged, to Milton J. Ferguson, the librarian of  the State Library at Sacramento, California, who was never-failing in  either service or patience.

Another was  Gifford, the son of Fred Garrison, after whom Fred Rover had been  named. There was also Walter Baxter, a son of Dan Baxter, who years  before had been an enemy of the older Rovers, but who had now reformed  and was doing very well.    Before coming to Colby Hall, Jack Rover had had a quarrel in New York  City with a tall, dudish youth, named Napoleon Martell. Nappy Martell,  as he was called by his cronies, was a cadet at the military academy,  and he and his crony, an overgrown bully named Slugger Brown, did what  they could to make trouble for the Rovers. But one of their  underhanded transactions was exposed, and they were sent away from the  academy for the time being.    As mentioned, Colby Hall was located about half a mile beyond Haven  Point. On the opposite side of the town was located Clearwater Hall,  a boarding school for girls. During a panic in a moving-picture  theater Jack and his cousins became acquainted with a number of these  girls, including Ruth Stevenson, May Powell, Alice Strobell, and Annie  Larkins. They found out that May was Spouter Powell's cousin, and the  whole crowd of young people soon became friends. Later on Mary and  Martha Rover became pupils at the girls' school.    Ruth Stevenson had an old uncle Barney, who in times past had had a  bitter quarrel with Ruth's parents. The Rover boys once went out  hunting, and on this occasion saved the old man's life, as related in  \"The Rover Boys on Snowshoe Island.\" For this the old man was  exceedingly grateful, and as a result he invited them to spend their  winter holidays on Snowshoe Island, a place which he said he owned and  of which he was very proud.    The boys traveled to this island and had many adventures while hunting  and otherwise. They found out that the father of Slogwell Brown,  always called Slugger by his comrades, was laying claim to the island.  This man, backed up by Asa Lemm, a discharged teacher of Colby Hall,  and backed up likewise by his son Slugger and Nappy Martell, did all  he could to take possession of the property. But the Rover boys  exposed the plot, and held the rascals at bay, and in the end old  Barney Stevenson's claim to the land was made safe. During the time on  the island Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell had stolen a tin box  containing some valuable papers from the old man, and for this they  had at first been threatened with arrest, but had been allowed to go  when Slugger's father gave up his claim to the place.    \"You think you're smart, don't you?\" Slugger Brown had grumbled to  Jack when he was ready to depart from Snowshoe Island. \"You just wait,  Jack Rover! I'm not going to forget you and your cousins in a hurry!\"    \"And I won't forget you either,\" Nappy Martell had added. \"We'll get  even with you when you least expect it.\"    But for quite a while now none of the Rovers had seen or heard  anything more of Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell. But they were  destined to hear more from these two unworthies, and in a most unusual  fashion.          CHAPTER III    THE AMMUNITION FACTORY EXPLOSIONS      \"Oh, I do hope Mary is safe!\" cried Martha Rover, as she and the  others ran toward where the automobiles which had brought them over to  Colby Hall from the girls' boarding school were standing.    \"So far those explosions haven't reached Clearwater Hall,\" answered  her brother Jack. \"But there is no telling what a real heavy explosion  may do.\"    \"That's just it!\" burst out his cousin Randy. \"For all we know, those  Hasley people may have a large quantity of TNT or some other high  explosive stored there, and if that should go up--good-night!\"    \"It would be fierce!\"    \"I think it's awful to allow those ammunition people to have their  works so close to a town,\" was Ruth Stevenson's comment.    _Boom! Boom!_    Two more explosions rent the air. Then followed a series of poppings  like the discharge of a machine gun.    \"Those must be some of the small shells going off,\" said Andy. \"Gosh,  what a shame they couldn't have held this back until the Fourth of  July!\" he added. Andy would probably have wanted to joke at his own  funeral.    The Rovers and their girl friends were soon seated in the automobiles  which they had used earlier in the day to bring the girls to Colby  Hall. With them went as many of the other cadets and their friends as  could pile into the machines or hang fast to the running boards. All  of the ball players went in their baseball outfits, not taking time to  change to their uniforms.    The Rovers and their friends were among the first to leave the  military institution, and for this reason they got away without any  trouble. They had scarcely departed when Captain Mapes Dale, the  military instructor attached to the school, appeared and forbade any  more of the cadets to leave the grounds.    \"There is no telling how dangerous those explosions may become,\" said  Captain Dale, \"and Colonel Colby thinks it is best that you remain  here where it is comparatively safe. Even as it is, we may have some  big shells coming this way.\"    The Hasley Shell Loading Company had been located on the opposite  shore of Clearwater Lake for a number of years previous to the opening  of the war in Europe. But at that time it had been only a small  concern, employing but a handful of men. A year after the opening of  hostilities, however, the plant had been enlarged, and now, since the  entrance of the United States into the war, the force of workmen had  been again doubled and many additional buildings had been erected,  some along the lake front and others in the hills further back. A spur  of the railroad had also been built to the plant, and on this were  numerous cars, all painted to show the dangerous nature of the freight  they were destined to carry.    On two different occasions the Rover boys and their chums had rowed  over to the vicinity of the shell-loading works to look at what was  going on. Guards around the works, however, had kept them from landing  or even getting within a reasonable distance of the place. This, they  knew, was done because the authorities feared that some spies might  try to get into the buildings with a view to blowing them up.    \"Gee, that certainly sounds like war!\" cried Andy, as the explosions  continued. There was a continual popping of small shells, punctured  every now and then by a decidedly heavier explosion.    \"My gracious! Look at that!\" burst out Jack a moment later.    What the oldest Rover boy referred to was a curious explosion of a  quantity of shells which seemed to go up in the form of an immense  sheaf of wheat. Thousands of small objects filled the air, flying off  in all directions of the compass.    \"I'll bet we'll get some of those over here!\" exclaimed Gif Garrison,  who was clinging to the running board of the machine.    And he was right. Only a few seconds later several small bits of metal  came down around them, two striking the hood of the automobile and one  falling into the tonneau on Ruth's lap.    It did not take those in the automobile long to cover the half mile  which lay between them and Haven Point, where the railroad station was  located. Here they found the town people in great excitement, and  learned that steps were already being taken to care for any of the  workmen who might be injured by the explosions.    \"Of course we have no idea yet how many people have been killed or  wounded,\" declared a policeman who gave the cadets this information.  \"We are all upset because we don't know how bad the explosions may  get. If they don't get any worse than they have been, we'll be  thankful.\"    The cadets and their girl friends did not remain long in Haven Point.  All were anxious to get to Clearwater Hall, to learn if that place was  much damaged. The girls' school was directly opposite the  shell-loading plant, and consequently more liable to suffer than the  town or Colby Hall.    \"Look at them getting away from that place, will you?\" cried Fred, who  had come as far as Haven Point on another automobile and then had  rejoined his cousins. He pointed to the lake, where a number of  rowboats and other craft were leaving the vicinity of the explosions.    \"You can't blame them for wanting to get away,\" returned Jack. \"It may  mean life or death to them.\"    \"Oh, I hope nobody has been killed!\" murmured Ruth.    \"I'm afraid, Ruth, that's too much to expect,\" answered Jack soberly.    \"Oh, I just think war is too horrible for anything!\" cried out Alice  Strobell, who was along.    \"I just wish they could sink all those Germans in their old  submarines!\" declared Annie Larkins who was also in the crowd.    \"I guess we'd all be willing to subscribe to that!\" cried Randy.    \"You just wait until Uncle Sam gets into this scrap,\" declared Jack.  \"We'll show 'em what's what!\"    \"How I wish I could go to the front,\" said Andy wistfully. \"It would  beat going to school all hollow.\"    \"Now that we've gone into the war, we'll have an army over there  before long,\" said Spouter. \"I suppose they'll send some of the  regulars over first, and then some of the national guard--of course  taken into the regular army--and after that we'll have the volunteers.  I suppose if Uncle Sam really wanted to do it, he could get together  several million men without half trying. And with an army like that,  properly trained and equipped, and transported to the battlefields of  Europe, we shall be sure to make a showing which will throw terror  into the hearts of----\"    \"Hurrah! Spouter is off again,\" broke in Randy.    \"Say, Spout! they ought to send you to the front to help talk the Huns  to death,\" put in Andy. \"Talk about gas and gas masks----\"    \"Aw say! you're always butting in when I've got something to say,\"  growled the lad who loved to talk.    There might have been a little friction right then and there, but  another explosion came from across Clearwater Lake, and all stopped to  gaze at the thick"]]]
