[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#4)"],[1," state--the species,  except for the cultivated forms, having gone into the irrecoverable  past. This is the case with the wild kindred of our bulls, horses,  sheep, and camels, there probably being none of the original wild  species of these groups now living, except those which have been more  or less completely subjugated by man, and then have returned to the  wilderness. The fact is, that with any large mammal the domestication  of the species tends to bring about the destruction of the remaining  wild forms. If we go back in fancy to the time when the dog was taken  in from the wilderness, we readily perceive how certainly the  subjugated individuals would have mingled with their wild kindred, so  that either the wild would have become tame or _vice versa_. The same  incompatibility which exists between slavery and freedom in our own  species in any given territory may be said to hold in the case of  captive animals. It is particularly on this account that I am disposed  to think that our races of dogs have been derived from one or more  original species of truly canine ancestors, the wild forms of which  have long since disappeared from the earth.    [Illustration: St. Bernard]    Although there are no species of wild dogs now in existence to which we  can refer the origin of our household friends, there are several known  to us only in their fossil state, from which they may possibly--indeed,  we may say probably--have been derived. These creatures are, of course,  represented only by their skeletons, and even these remains have only  been found in an imperfect state of preservation. It is evident,  however, that these extinct species, or at least certain of them, lived  down to the time when man had come upon the earth, and was beginning to  speculate on his surroundings for such company and help as he might win  therefrom. It may interest the reader to know that a species of American  dog existed in the Southern Appalachians down to a very recent  time--recent, at least, in a geological sense. The remains of one of  these animals were found by the writer in a cave in East Tennessee, near  Cumberland Gap. From the fragments of the skeleton, Mr. J. A. Allen has  described the species. The animal appears to have been of moderate  size, and, from the position of the bones, it seems tolerably certain  that it lived but a few centuries ago.    It is clearly a reasonable supposition that some of these primitive  canine species may have been far more domesticable than the existing  kindred of the dog--the wolves, foxes, jackals, or hyenas--differing  from their fiercer kindred much as the zebras do from the wild asses,  the one form being utterly undomesticable, and the other lending its  back almost willingly to the burdens which man chooses to impose. It  seems likely that this primitive species--perhaps more than one--whence  the dog sprang was not a very vigorous or widespread form; else, as  before remarked, a savage would have found it impossible to keep his  half-tamed creatures from rejoining their wild kinsmen. Thus, if a man  should in this day succeed in taming wolves, in a region where they were  plenty, to the point where they began to abide his presence, or even to  have some slight affection for him, the call of nature would be likely  to lead them back to reunion with their kind.    It seems pretty certain that the first steps in the domestication of the  dog must be attributed not to any distinct purpose of acquiring a useful  companion, but to that vague instinct which leads children to make  captives of any wild animals with which they come in contact. The fancy  for pets is not only common to all mankind, civilized and savage alike,  but is clearly exhibited in many of the mammals below the level of man.  Almost every one has observed cases where dogs, cats, and horses have  become attached to some creature of an alien species with which they  have been by chance thrown in contact. The higher the grade of the  intelligence, the more sympathetic with other life the animal is likely  to become. Thus the elephants, whose natural endowments in the way of  intelligence are perhaps superior to those of any other wild creatures,  are, when brought into captivity, curiously prone to form attachments to  human beings. Savages appear to make but little use of their dogs in  hunting. In fact, those peculiar combinations of instinct and training  which we find in our hounds, pointers, setters, and other dogs which  have been bred to serve the purposes of sportsmen, have been acquired  but slowly, and are of no value except where the search for game is  carried on under what we may term civilized conditions. The dog of the  savage is in all countries much like his master--a creature with few  arts and unaccustomed to subdue his rude native impulses.    [Illustration: Spaniel Retrieving Wild Duck]    It seems most likely that for ages the principal use of the dog which  dwelt about the camps of the primitive people was found in the reserve  food supply which they afforded their thriftless masters. When the  hunting was successful the poor brutes had a chance to wax fat, and  even in times of scarcity they managed to pick up enough food to keep  them alive. When their masters were brought to a state of famine they  were doubtless accustomed, as are many savages at the present time, to  eat a portion of their pack. In the early conditions of humanity there  was no other beast which could be made to serve so well this simple  need in the way of provender. The dog is, in fact, the only animal  ever domesticated which can be trusted through his own affections  alone to abide with his master in the endless changes of camp and the  rapid movements of flight and chase which characterized men before  their housed state began. In a certain curious way the use of dogs for  food has served greatly to advance the development of these captives.  When the savage was driven to feed upon his dogs he was naturally more  willing to sacrifice the least intelligent and affectionate of them,  delaying, to the point of extremity, the time when he would kill those  which had endeared themselves to him. In this way for ages a careful  though unintended process of selection was applied to these creatures,  and to it we may fairly attribute, as many considerate naturalists  have done, a large part of the intellectual--indeed, we may say  moral--elevation to which they have attained.    When the place of the dog as the first and most intimate companion of  man was affirmed in the rude way above described--when the savagery to  which he was at first made free gradually enlarged to civilization, a  number of special uses were found for the peculiar capacities of the  creature. These varied in the different parts of the world, according  to the peculiarities in the conditions of the masters. In high  latitudes, where the ground is snow-covered during the winter season,  dogs were used, as they are to this day, in dragging sleds. They were,  indeed, perhaps the first animals which were harnessed to vehicles. When  they were brought to serve this definite end, we may well believe that  the stronger and more enduring individuals were spared in times of  dearth for the reason that they were almost indispensable to their  masters, and even the little forethought which we find among primitive  peoples would lead to their preservation. Here again, doubtless, came in  the process of unintended selection which has made the Esquimau sled-dog  one of the most remarkable varieties of his kind.    Perhaps the most interesting of the early variations induced among  dogs is that which has arisen from the pastoral habit. We do not know  when this custom of keeping sheep in large flocks was first  instituted, but it is evidently of exceeding antiquity, probably far  older than the pyramids of Egypt. The custom could hardly have been  instituted without help of the shepherd's mate, the sheep-dog.  Although the creatures of this breed are probably in form very near to  the original wild species whence our canines came, the variety has as  regards its instincts been, by a process of education and selection,  led very far away from the original stock.    The wild forefathers of this species were clearly natural born  sheep-slayers, and the motive abides to this day in all the breeds which  have the strength to assail our unresisting flocks. The spirit is so  ingrained that even the most civilized of our house-dogs, which may for  generations never have tasted blood and which show no disposition to  attack the other animals of the barn-yard, cannot be trusted alone with  sheep. When two or more of them are together the old instincts of the  wild pack return, and they will slay with insensate brutality until they  are fairly exhausted with their fury. Their behavior on such occasions  reminds one of the actions of their masters when possessed with the  blind rage of a mob. Yet in the shepherd-dog we find this ancestral  motive, once a large part of the life of the creature, so overcome by  education and selection that they will not only care for a flock with  all the devotion which self-interest can lead the master to give to the  task, but they will cheerfully undergo almost any measure of privation  in order to protect their charges from harm. The annals of shepherd  districts, especially those where winter snows fall deeply, as in  Scotland, abound in anecdotes of a well-attested nature which show how  profoundly the dogs which tend the flocks are imbued with the love of  the animals committed to their care. This affection is more curious for  the reason that it is never in any measure returned by the sheep. To  them the custodian is ever a dreaded overseer. He seems to bring to them  nothing but the memories of danger derived from the experience which  their species acquired in far-away times.    It is very interesting to note the behavior of a young "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2557"],[0,"Old Mother West Wind (#4)"],[1," Lone Little Path that leads to the Laughing Brook. Hoppity, skip,  skippity hop! Reddy felt very much pleased with himself that sunny  morning. Pretty soon he saw Johnny Chuck sitting up very straight close  by the little house where he lives.    \"Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck! Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck! Johnny  Woodchuck!\" called Reddy fox.    Johnny Chuck pretended not to hear. His mother had told him not to play  with Reddy Fox, for Reddy Fox was a bad boy.    \"Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck! Johnny Woodchuck!\" called Reddy again.    This time Johnny turned and looked. He could see Reddy Fox turning  somersaults and chasing his tail and rolling over and over in the little  path.    \"Come on!\" said Reddy Fox. \"Let's go fishing!\"    \"Can't,\" said Johnny Chuck, because you know, his mother had told him  not to play with Reddy Fox.    \"I'll show you how to catch a fish,\" said Reddy Fox, and tried to jump  over his own shadow.    \"Can't,\" said good little Johnny Chuck again, and turned away so that he  couldn't see Reddy Fox chasing Butterflies and playing catch with Field  Mice children.    So Reddy Fox went down to the Laughing Brook all alone. The Brook was  laughing and singing on its way to join the Big River. The sky was blue  and the sun was bright. Reddy Fox jumped on the Big Rock in the middle  of the Laughing Brook and peeped over the other side. What do you think  he saw? Why, right down below in a Dear Little Pool were Mr. And Mrs.  Trout and all the little Trouts.    Reddy Fox wanted some of those little Trouts to take home for his  dinner, but he didn't know how to catch them. He lay flat down on the  Big Rock and reached way down into the Dear Little Pool, but all the  little Trouts laughed at Reddy Fox and not one came within reach. Then  Mr. Trout swam up so quickly that Reddy Fox didn't see him coming and  bit Reddy's little black paw hard.    \"Ouch!\" cried Reddy Fox, pulling his little black paw out of the water.  And all the little Trouts laughed at Reddy Fox.    Just then along came Billy Mink.    \"Hello, Reddy Fox!\" said Billy Mink. \"What are you doing here?\"    \"I'm trying to catch a fish,\" said Reddy Fox.    \"Pooh! That's easy!\" said Billy Mink. \"I'll show you how.\"    So Billy Mink lay down on the Big Rock side of Reddy Fox and peeped over  into the Dear Little Pool where all the little Trouts were laughing at  Reddy Fox and having such a good time. But Billy Mink took care, such  very great care, that Mr. Trout and Mrs. Trout should not see him  peeping over into the Dear Little Pool.    When Billy Mink saw all those little Trouts playing in the Dear Little  Pool he laughed. \"You count three, Reddy Fox,\" said he, \"and I'll show  you how to catch a fish.\"    \"One!\" said Reddy Fox, \"Two! Three!\"    Splash! Billy Mink had dived head first into the Dear Little Pool. He  spattered water way up onto Reddy Fox, and he frightened old Mr. Frog  so that he fell over backwards off the lily pad where he was taking a  morning nap right into the water. In a minute Billy Mink climbed out on  the other side of the Dear Little Pool and sure enough, he had caught  one of the little Trouts.    \"Give it to me,\" cried Reddy Fox.    \"Catch one yourself,\" said Billy Mink. \"Old Grandpa Mink wants a fish  for his dinner, so I am going to take this home. You're afraid, Reddy  Fox! 'Fraid-cat! Fraid-cat!\"    Billy Mink shook the water off of his little brown coat, picked up the  little Trout and ran off home.    Reddy Fox lay down again on the Big Rock and peeped into the Dear Little  Pool. Not a single Trout could he see. They were all hiding safely with  Mr. and Mrs. Trout. Reddy Fox watched and watched. The sun was warm, the  Laughing Brook was singing a lullaby and--what do you think? Why, Reddy  Fox went fast asleep on the edge of the great Big Rock.    By and by Reddy Fox began to dream. He dreamed that he had a nice little  brown coat that was waterproof, just like the little brown coat that  Billy Mink wore. Yes, and he dreamed that he had learned to swim and to  catch fish just as Billy Mink did. He dreamed that the Dear Little  Pool was full of little Trouts and that he was just going to catch one  when--splash! Reddy Fox had rolled right off of the Big Rock into the  Dear Little Pool.    The water went into the eyes of Reddy Fox, and it went up his nose  and he swallowed so much that he felt as if he never, never would want  another drink of water. And his beautiful red coat, which old Mother  Fox had told him to be very, very careful of because he couldn't have  another for a whole year, was oh so wet! And his pants were wet and his  beautiful bushy tail, of which he was so proud, was so full of water  that he couldn't hold it up, but had to drag it up the bank after him as  he crawled out of the Dear Little Pool.    \"Ha! Ha! Ha!\" laughed Mr. Kingfisher, sitting on a tree.    \"Ho! Ho! Ho!\" laughed old Mr. Frog, who had climbed back on his lily  pad.    \"He! He! He!\" laughed all the little Trouts and Mr. Trout and Mrs.  Trout, swimming round and round in the Dear Little Pool.    \"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! He! He! He!\" laughed Billy Mink, who had come  back to the Big Rock just in time to see Reddy Fox tumble in.    Reddy Fox didn't say a word, he was so ashamed. He just crept up the  Lone Little Path to his home, dragging his tail, all wet and muddy,  behind him, and dripping water all the way.    Johnny Chuck was still sitting by his door as his mother had told him  to. Reddy Fox tried to go past without being seen, but Johnny Chuck's  bright little eyes saw him.    \"Where are your fish, Reddy Fox?\" called Johnny Chuck.    \"Why don't you turn somersaults, and jump over your shadow and chase  Butterflies and play with the little Field Mice, Reddy Fox?\" called  Johnny Chuck.    But Reddy Fox just walked faster. When he got almost home he saw old  Mother Fox sitting in the doorway with a great big switch across her  lap, for Mother Fox had told Reddy Fox not to go near the Laughing  Brook.    And this is all I am going to tell you about how Reddy Fox went fishing.        CHAPTER VII JIMMY SKUNK LOOKS FOR BEETLES    Jimmy Skunk opened his eyes very early one morning and peeped out of  his snug little house on the hill. Big, round Mr. Sun, with a very red,  smiling face, had just begun to climb up into the sky. Old Mother West  Wind was just starting down to the Green Meadows with her big bag over  her shoulder. In that bag Jimmy Skunk knew she carried all her children,  the Merry Little Breezes, whom she was taking down to the Green Meadows  to play and frolic all day.    \"Good morning, Mother West Wind,\" said Jimmy Skunk, politely. \"Did you  see any beetles as you came down the hill?\"    Old Mother West Wind said, no, she hadn't seen any beetles as she came  down the hill.    \"Thank you,\" said Jimmy Skunk politely. \"I guess I'll have to go look  myself, for I'm very, very hungry.\"    So Jimmy Skunk brushed his handsome black and white coat, and washed  his face and hands, and started out to try to find some beetles for his  breakfast. First he went down to the Green Meadows and stopped at Johnny  Chuck's house. But Johnny Chuck was still in bed and fast asleep. Then  Jimmy Skunk went over to see if Reddy Fox would go with him to help find  some beetles for his breakfast. But Reddy Fox had been out very, very  late the night before and was still in bed fast asleep, too.    So Jimmy Skunk set out all alone along the Crooked Little Path up the  hill to find some beetles for his breakfast. He walked very slowly, for  Jimmy Skunk never hurries. He stopped and peeped under every old log to  see if there were any beetles. By and by he came to a big piece of bark  beside the Crooked Little Path. Jimmy Skunk took hold of the piece of  bark with his two little black paws and pulled and pulled. All of a  sudden, the big piece of bark turned over so quickly that Jimmy Skunk  fell flat on his back.    When Jimmy Skunk had rolled over onto his feet again, there sat old Mr.  Toad right in the path, and old Mr. Toad was very, very cross indeed. He  swelled and he puffed and he puffed and he swelled, till he was twice as  big as Jimmy Skunk had ever seen him before.    \"Good morning, Mr. Toad,\" said Jimmy Skunk. \"Have you seen any beetles?\"    But Mr. Toad blinked his great round goggly eyes and he said: \"What do  you mean, Jimmy Skunk, by pulling the roof off my house?\"    \"Is that the roof of your house?\" asked Jimmy Skunk politely. \"I won't  do it again.\"    Then Jimmy Skunk stepped right over old Mr. Toad, and went on up the  Crooked Little Path to look for some beetles.    By and by he came to an old stump of a tree which was hollow and had the  nicest little round hole in one side. Jimmy Skunk took hold of one edge  with his two little black paws and pulled and pulled. All of a sudden  the whole side of the old stump tore open and Jimmy Skunk fell flat on  his back.    When Jimmy Skunk had rolled over onto his feet again there was Striped  Chipmunk hopping up and down right in the middle of the path, he was so  angry.    \"Good morning, Striped Chipmunk,\" said Jimmy Skunk. \"Have you seen any  beetles?\"    But Striped Chipmunk hopped faster than ever and he said: \"What do you  mean, Jimmy Skunk, by pulling the side off my house?\"    \"Is that the side of your house?\" asked Jimmy Skunk, politely. \"I won't  do it again.\"    Then Jimmy Skunk stepped right over Striped Chipmunk, and went on up the  Crooked Little Path to look for some beetles.    Pretty soon he met Peter Rabbit hopping along down the Crooked Little  Path. \"Good morning, Jimmy Skunk, where are you going so early in the  morning?\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"Good morning, Peter Rabbit. Have you seen any beetles?\" asked Jimmy  Skunk, politely.    \"No, I haven't seen any beetles, but I'll help you find some,\" said  Peter Rabbit. So he turned about and hopped ahead of Jimmy Skunk up the  Crooked Little Path.    Now because Peter Rabbit's legs are long and he is always"]]]
