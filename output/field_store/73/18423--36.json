After you once get in here he, of course, can't take the  time to follow you up. Having done you the favor of giving you a start  he will drop you from his mind. You cannot expect anything else and I am  glad you have common sense enough to see it.\"    At the thought of his father \"dropping him from his mind\" Peter smiled  inwardly. Of course Mr. Tyler could not see the smile, and even if he  had he would not have understood it. As it was he now cut short the  interview by touching a bell at his elbow in response to which a  messenger appeared.    \"Take this boy down to the yard, Johnson,\" he said. \"Introduce him to  Carmachel and tell him he is to help unload skins. His name is Strong.  Good luck to you, young man. Remember the world is a large place and  there are plenty of fine positions waiting for the men who prove  themselves big enough to fill them.\"    Peter took the superintendent's hand but he forgot to answer. Somehow  Mr. Tyler's words awakened a train of thoughts which were so entirely  new that he could not immediately drive them from his mind. So the great  universe of work demanded that you should fill your position, not rattle  round in it! The mere fact that one had a rich father did not help much  then after all. It might aid you in keeping your job, to be sure, but it  could not aid you in doing it. Evidently at the Coddington tanneries  there were plenty of men ready to take your chance if you were not smart  enough to hold on to it yourself. Peter decided that it behooved him to  \"hustle.\" It was a novel sensation to feel this spur to action.    As he thus philosophized he was following his guide, who now turned down  a flight of steep steps into a yard slippery with black mud and deeply  rutted by the wheels of heavy wagons. A double track with a row of  freight cars flanked the building opposite, and from these cars a group  of men were unloading bundles of skins and tossing them on the platform.  The men were dressed in faded jumpers and overalls and some of them wore  rubber aprons.    They glanced up an instant as Peter drew near.    \"Carmachel,\" called the man who was showing the way, \"this young fellow  is to help at unloading and later, the boss says, he is to watch you  fellows sort skins. He is a green lad and,\" added the messenger with a  grin of enjoyment at some joke that Peter did not at all comprehend,  \"his name is Strong.\"    Carmachel, a grizzled Irishman, looked up--a twinkle in his eye.    \"It's Strong he'll have to be if he is to work here,\" he answered with a  chuckle in which the others joined. \"I say, young one,\" he continued  kindly, \"you're not figuring on unloading skins in those clothes, are  you?\"    \"I was,\" replied Peter, nodding.    \"Well, before you begin, you better have another think. It will be the  end of your glad rags. It's truth I'm tellin' you. Step inside the  doorway and wriggle yourself into those brown jeans you'll see hangin'  there.\"    Peter went in.    He took down the jeans from a peg behind the door. The clothes were  dirty, sticky with salt, and in them lingered a loathsome aroma of wet  hides. Instinctively he shrank from touching them. Then, gritting his  teeth, he put them on. This he did more out of appreciation for the  rough kindliness of the old Irishman than because he feared to injure  his clothes; his father would give him plenty more suits if that one was  spoiled.    When he went out on the platform Carmachel eyed him.    \"That's more like it,\" he said. \"Now get busy. We want to pull these  cars out of the yard by noon. Step lively.\"    Peter crossed the wet, slippery platform to the car where the other men  were working. The skins were folded neatly and tied with stout cord. He  lifted the bundle nearest at hand, then dropped it. It was solid,  sticky, and damp.    \"They're wet!\" he exclaimed.    \"For certain they're wet!\" roared the Irishman with a noisy guffaw.  \"You're as green as the skins themselves--greener, for you are not even  salted.\"    The gang on the platform shouted at the joke.    Peter's anger rose, but he struggled to take their chaffing in good  part.    \"You see, I don't know a thing about all this business,\" confessed he,  frankly. \"You fellows who do will have to tell me.\"    The answer struck the right note with the men.    \"How could you be expected to know, sonny?\" called a red-faced Swede  kindly. \"Every boy who comes into the tannery has to learn.\"    \"Pitch a few skins out of the car, lad, while I tell you some things,\"  broke in Carmachel. \"You are unloading calfskins; that's the only kind  we tan at Factory 1. Over at Factory 2 they tan sheepskins, and at  Factory 3 cowhides. In each of these factories the skins are treated and  prepared for the trade quite differently, as you will learn by and by if  you have the chance to go through the other buildings. These calfskins  that we are unloading came from the Chicago slaughter-houses, where as  soon as they were taken off the animals they were salted; folded with  the head, tail, and small parts inside; tied in bales such as you see;  and shipped. They are what we call green-salted. We also get  green-salted skins from the abattoirs of the city of Paris, and from  lots of other places, too. Sometimes, though, skins are salted green and  are then dried like those you saw piled up in the shed; those we call  dry-salted. They came from Norway, Sweden, and South America. Then we  have dry hides which are dried without being salted at all. Remember  now--green-salted, dry-salted, and dry.\"    Peter repeated the terms.    At the same time he did his share in tossing the heavy bales of moist  skins to the platform. It was strenuous work. Before an hour was up his  back and arms ached with the unaccustomed exercise. Tennis and football  were as nothing to this! Still he went on uncomplainingly. His  unflagging energy appealed to the men.    \"Knock off, lad, and rest a bit,\" called Carmachel at last. \"You're not  toughened to this job as we are. It's a precious lame back you'll have  to-morrow if you keep at it like this the first time.\"    Gratefully Peter straightened up and took a long breath. Then he glanced  at his hands.    \"You'll be losing your gentlemanly white hands, if that's what's  worrying you,\" grinned Carmachel, reading his thoughts with  disconcerting keenness.    \"Oh, I'm not afraid of my hands,\" replied Peter, mortified at being  detected in such a foolish reflection. \"I was just thinking that they  are beginning to look the part.\"    \"If you are aiming to work up through the tannery they'll likely look  the part more by the time you've got a few coats of lime and blacking on  them,\" was Carmachel's dry response. \"Now we'll let the others finish  this work. You come inside and you shall have a new job. You've done  enough unloading for your first day.\"    Obediently Peter followed into the shed, where other men were busy  cutting the cords from round the skins, looking them over, and tossing  some into one pile and some into another.    \"These fellows that you see are sorting the calfskins according to their  weight,\" explained Carmachel. \"We get them flat--by that I mean that  when the bales are made up all sizes and qualities of skins are tied in  together. These men put the fine, heavy ones in one pile, the medium  weight in another, the light weight in another, the imperfect ones in  another, and so on.\"    \"I do not see how they can tell so quickly,\" said Peter.    \"They couldn't if they hadn't done it a good many times before. They are  skilled men. Watch them. It does not take them many minutes to determine  the value of a skin.\"    \"And what are those other men doing?\" Peter questioned, pointing to a  group of workmen who were engaged in swiftly cutting off parts of the  skins with long knives.    \"Oh, they are taking off the heads and other good-for-nothing parts  which are sold for glue stock. Nothing is wasted in a tannery, let me  tell you! After the skins leave this room they will be sent to the  beamhouse, where they will be soaked in water until all the dirt and  salt is out of them. Usually this takes from twenty-four to forty-eight  hours.\"    \"What's the beamhouse?\" was Peter's query.    \"The beamhouse? I'll not be telling you. 'Twould be a sin to spoil your  first sight of it.\" Carmachel shook his head. \"No, young one, I'll tell  you nothing of the beamhouse. You'll find out in time. There's many a  pleasant spot awaiting you in this tannery.\"    A general snicker went around.    Again Peter did not understand.    \"Now,\" declared Carmachel briskly, \"you have idled long enough. Take  that knife and go to cutting the twine from those bales of skins.\"    At this task the boy worked faithfully until the noon whistle blew. At  its first blast all the men dropped what they were doing and Peter, who  did the same, followed them into a washroom, where he scoured his hands  with sand soap. Somehow he did not feel as scornful toward his box of  lunch as he had when he had tucked it under his arm in the early  morning. Instead he made his way out into the vacant field opposite  where he saw the men congregating, and sitting down in the shade of one  of the factories, lifted the tin cover with keenest anticipation. How  good it seemed to rest, and how faint he was! He devoured the food  hurriedly with the quick greed of hunger. He then glanced about him.  Some boys and men were sauntering with bat and ball out into the open  field. Apparently a noontide game was a part of the daily program, for  two nines were quickly organized and a match was under way in the  twinkling of an eye. The other workmen drew near to watch the play and  so did Peter. He wondered how any one could summon energy enough to toss  a ball. They couldn't be as tired as he was! The game began. Before it  had proceeded beyond the first inning it was obvious that the teams were  unevenly matched.    ["]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#4)"],[1,"to a land in every way suited for such a purpose, both by  reason of its fertility and of its great distance. Viscount Sydney,  therefore, determined to send out a party to Botany Bay, in order to  found a convict settlement there; and in May, 1787, a fleet was ready to  sail. It consisted of the _Sirius_ war-ship, its tender the _Supply_,  together with six transports for the convicts, and three ships for  carrying the stores. Of the convicts, five hundred and fifty were men  and two hundred and twenty were women. To guard these, there were on  board two hundred soldiers. Captain Phillip was appointed Governor of  the colony, Captain Hunter was second in command, and Mr. Collins went  out as judge-advocate, to preside in the military courts, which it was  intended to establish for the administration of justice. On the 18th,  19th, and 20th of January, 1788, the vessels arrived, one after another,  in Botany Bay, after a voyage of eight months, during which many of the  convicts had died from diseases brought on by so long a confinement.      #2. Port Jackson.#--As soon as the ships had anchored in Botany Bay,  convicts were landed and commenced to clear the timber from a portion of  the land; but a day or two was sufficient to show the unsuitability of  Botany Bay for such a settlement. Its waters were so shallow that the  ships could not enter it properly, and had to lie near the Heads, where  the great waves of the Pacific rolled in on them by night and day.  Governor Phillip, therefore, took three boats, and sailed out to search  for some more convenient harbour. As he passed along the coast he turned  to examine the opening which Captain Cook had called Port Jackson, and  soon found himself in a winding channel of water, with great cliffs  frowning overhead. All at once a magnificent prospect opened on his  eyes. A harbour, which is, perhaps, the most beautiful and perfect in  the world, stretched before him far to the west, till it was lost on the  distant horizon. It seemed a vast maze of winding waters, dotted here  and there with lovely islets; its shores thickly wooded down to the  strips of golden sand which lined the most charming little bays; and its  broad sheets of rippling waters bordered by lines of dusky foliage. The  scene has always been one of surpassing loveliness; but to those who  filled the first boats that ever threw the foam from its surface, who  felt themselves the objects of breathless attention to groups of natives  who stood gazing here and there from the projecting rocks, it must have  had an enchanting effect. To Captain Phillip himself, whose mind had  been filled with anxiety and despondency as to the future prospects of  his charge, it opened out like the vision of a world of new hope and  promise.    [Illustration: ROCKS, SOUTH HEADS, SYDNEY.]    Three days were spent in examining portions of this spacious harbour,  and in exploring a few of its innumerable bays. Captain Phillip  selected, as the place most suitable for the settlement, a small inlet,  which, in honour of the Minister of State, he called Sydney Cove. It was  so deep as to allow vessels to approach to within a yard or two of the  shore, thus avoiding the necessity of spending time and money in  building wharves or piers. After a few days the fleet was brought round  and lay at anchor in this little cove which is now the crowded Circular  Quay. The convicts were landed, and commenced to clear away the trees on  the banks of a small stream which stole silently through a very dense  wood. When an open space had been obtained, a flagstaff was erected near  the present battery on Dawe's Point; the soldiers fired three volleys,  and the Governor read his commission to the assembled company. Then  began a scene of noise and bustle. From dawn to sunset, nothing could be  heard but the sound of axes, hammers, and saws, with the crash of trees  and the shouts of the convict overseers. They lost no time in preparing  their habitations on shore; for the confinement of the overcrowded ships  had become intolerably hateful.      #3. Early Sufferings.#--More than a third of their number were ill with  scurvy and other diseases--sixty-six lay in the little hospital which  had been set up, and many of them never recovered. Those who were well  enough to work began to clear the land for cultivation; but so soon as  everything was ready for the ploughing to begin, the amazing fact was  discovered that no one knew anything of agriculture; and had it not been  that Governor Phillip had with him a servant who had been for a time on  a farm, their labour would have been of little avail. As it was, the  cultivation was of the rudest kind; one man, even if he had been a  highly experienced person, could do very little to instruct so many. The  officers and soldiers were smart enough on parade, but they were useless  on a farm; the convicts, instead of trying to learn, expended all their  ingenuity in picking each other's pockets, or in robbing the stores.  They would do no work unless an armed soldier was standing behind them,  and if he turned away for a moment, they would deliberately destroy the  farm implements in their charge, hide them in the sand or throw them  into the water. Thus, only a trifling amount of food was obtained from  the soil; the provisions they had brought with them were nearly  finished, and when the news came that the _Guardian_ transport, on which  they were depending for fresh supplies, had struck on an iceberg and had  been lost, the little community was filled with the deepest dismay. Soon  after, a ship arrived with a number of fresh convicts, but no  provisions; in great haste the _Sirius_ was sent to the Cape of Good  Hope, and the _Supply_ to Batavia; these vessels brought back as much as  they could get, but it was all used in a month or two. Starvation now  lay before the settlement; every one, including the officers and the  Governor himself, was put on the lowest rations which could keep the  life in a man's body, and yet there was not enough of food, even at  this miserable rate, to last for any length of time. Numbers died of  starvation; the Governor stopped all the works, as the men were too weak  to continue them. The sheep and cattle which they had brought with so  much trouble to become the origin of flocks and herds were all killed  for food, with the exception of two or three which had escaped to the  woods and had been lost from sight.      #4. Norfolk Island.#--Under these circumstances, Governor Phillip sent two  hundred convicts, with about seventy soldiers, to Norfolk Island, where  there was a moderate chance of their being able to support themselves;  for, immediately after his arrival in New South Wales, he had sent  Lieutenant King to take possession of that island, of whose beauty and  fertility Captain Cook had spoken very highly. Twenty-seven convicts and  soldiers had gone along with King, and had cleared away the timber from  the rich brown soil. They had little trouble in raising ample crops, and  were now in the midst of plenty, which their less fortunate companions  came to share. But the _Sirius_, in which they had been carried over,  was wrecked on a coral reef near the island before she could return, and  with her was lost a considerable quantity of provisions.      #5. The Second Fleet.#--The prospects of the colony at Sydney had grown  very black, when a store-ship suddenly appeared off the Heads. Great was  the rejoicing at first; but when a storm arose and drove the vessel  northward among the reefs of Broken Bay, their exultation was changed to  a painful suspense. For some hours her fate was doubtful; but, to the  intense relief of the expectant people on shore, she managed to make  the port and land her supplies. Shortly after, two other store-ships  arrived, and the community was never again so badly in want of  provisions. Matters were growing cheerful, when a fresh gloom was caused  by the arrival of a fleet filled to overflowing with sick and dying  convicts. Seventeen hundred had been embarked, but of these two hundred  had died on the way, and their bodies had been thrown overboard. Several  hundreds were in the last stages of emaciation and exhaustion; scarcely  one of the whole fifteen hundred who landed was fit for a day's work.  This brought fresh misery and trouble, and the deaths were of appalling  frequency.      #6. Escape of Prisoners.#--Many of the convicts sought to escape from  their sufferings by running away; some seized the boats in the harbour  and tried to sail for the Dutch colony in Java; others hid themselves  in the woods, and either perished or else returned, after weeks of  starvation, to give themselves up to the authorities. In 1791 a band of  between forty and fifty set out to walk to China, and penetrated a few  miles into the bush, where their bleached and whitened skeletons some  years after told their fate.      #7. Departure of Governor Phillip.#--Amid these cares and trials the  health of Governor Phillip fairly broke down, and, in 1792, forced him  to resign. He was a man of energy and decision; prompt and skilful, yet  humane and just in his character; his face, though pinched and pale with  ill-health, had a sweet and benevolent expression; no better man could  have been selected to fill the difficult position he held with so much  credit to himself. He received a handsome pension from the British  Government, and retired to spend his life in English society. Major  Grose and Captain Patterson took charge of the colony for the next three  years; but in 1795 Captain Hunter, who, after the loss of his ship, the  _Sirius_, had returned to England, arrived in Sydney to occupy the  position of Governor.      #8. Governor Hunter.#--By this time affairs had passed their crisis, and  were beginning to be favourable. About sixty convicts, whose sentences  had expired, had received grants of land, and, now that they were"]]]
