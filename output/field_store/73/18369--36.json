By birth I am a Vaishnavite, and  was taught Ahimsa in my childhood. I have derived much religious benefit  from Jain religious works as I have from scriptures of the other great  faiths of the world. I owe much to the living company of the deceased  philosopher, Rajachand Kavi, who was a Jain by birth. Thus, though my  views on Ahimsa are a result of my study of most of the faiths of the  world, they are now no longer dependent upon the authority of these  works. They are a part of my life, and, if I suddenly discovered that  the religious books read by me bore a different interpretation from the  one I had learnt to give them, I should still hold to the view of Ahimsa  as I am about to set forth here.    Our Shastras seem to teach that a man who really practises Ahimsa in its  fulness has the world at his feet; he so affects his surroundings that  even the snakes and other venomous reptiles do him no harm. This is said  to have been the experience of St. Francis of Assisi.    In its negative form it means not injuring any living being whether by  body or mind. It may not, therefore, hurt the person of any wrong-doer,  or bear any ill-will to him and so cause him mental suffering. This  statement does not cover suffering caused to the wrong-doer by natural  acts of mine which do not proceed from ill-will. It, therefore, does not  prevent me from withdrawing from his presence a child whom he, we shall  imagine, is about to strike. Indeed, the proper practice of Ahimsa  _requires_ me to withdraw the intended victim from the wrong-doer, if I  am, in any way whatsoever, the guardian of such a child. It was,  therefore, most proper for the passive resisters of South Africa to have  resisted the evil that the Union Government sought to do to them. They  bore no ill-will to it. They showed this by helping the Government  whenever it needed their help. _Their resistance consisted of  disobedience of the orders of the Government, even to the extent of  suffering death at their hands._ Ahimsa requires deliberate  self-suffering, not a deliberate injuring of the supposed wrong-doer.    In its positive form, Ahimsa means the largest love, the greatest  charity. If I am a follower of Ahimsa, I _must love_ my enemy. I must  apply the same rules to the wrong-doer who is my enemy or a stranger to  me, as I would to my wrong-doing father or son. This active Ahimsa  necessarily includes truth and fearlessness. As man cannot deceive the  loved one, he does not fear or frighten him or her. Gift of life is the  greatest of all gifts; a man who gives it in reality, disarms all  hostility. He has paved the way for an honourable understanding. And  none who is himself subject to fear can bestow that gift. He must,  therefore, be himself fearless. A man cannot then practice Ahimsa and be  a coward at the same time. The practice of Ahimsa calls forth the  greatest courage. It is the most soldierly of a soldier's virtues.  General Gordon has been represented in a famous statue as bearing only a  stick. This takes us far on the road to Ahimsa. But a soldier, who needs  the protection of even a stick, is to that extent so much the less a  soldier. He is the true soldier who knows how to die and stand his  ground in the midst of a hail of bullets. Such a one was Ambarisha, who  stood his ground without lifting a finger though Duryasa did his worst.  The Moors who were being pounded by the French gunners and who rushed to  the guns' mouths with 'Allah' on their lips, showed much the same type  of courage. Only theirs was the courage of desperation. Ambarisha's was  due to love. Yet the Moorish valour, readiness to die, conquered the  gunners. They frantically waved their hats, ceased firing, and greeted  their erstwhile enemies as comrades. And so the South African passive  resisters in their thousands were ready to die rather than sell their  honour for a little personal ease. This was Ahimsa in its active form.  It _never_ barters away honour. A helpless girl in the hands of a  follower of Ahimsa finds better and surer protection than in the hands  of one who is prepared to defend her only to the point to which his  weapons would carry him. The tyrant, in the first instance, will have to  walk to his victim over the dead body of her defender; in the second, he  has but to overpower the defender; for it is assumed that the cannon of  propriety in the second instance will be satisfied when the defender has  fought to the extent of his physical valour. In the first instance, as  the defender has matched his very soul against the mere body of the  tyrant, the odds are that the soul in the latter will be awakened, and  the girl would stand an infinitely greater chance of her honour being  protected than in any other conceivable circumstance, barring of course,  that of her own personal courage.    If we are unmanly today, we are so, not because we do not know how to  strike, but because we fear to die. He is no follower of Mahavira, the  apostle of Jainism, or of Buddha or of the Vedas, who being afraid to  die, takes flight before any danger, real or imaginary, all the while  wishing that somebody else would remove the danger by destroying the  person causing it. He is no follower of Ahimsa who does not care a straw  if he kills a man by inches by deceiving him in trade, or who would  protect by force of arms a few cows and make away with the butcher or  who, in order to do a supposed good to his country, does not mind  killing off a few officials. All these are actuated by hatred, cowardice  and fear. Here the love of the cow or the country is a vague thing  intended to satisfy one's vanity, or soothe a stinging conscience.    Ahimsa truly understood is in my humble opinion a panacea for all evils  mundane and extra-mundane. We can never overdo it. Just at present we  are not doing it at all. Ahimsa does not displace the practice of other  virtues, but renders their practice imperatively necessary before it can  be practised even in its rudiments. Mahavira and Buddha were soldiers,  and so was Tolstoy. Only they saw deeper and truer into their  profession, and found the secret of a true, happy, honourable and godly  life. Let us be joint sharers with these teachers, and this land of ours  will once more be the abode of gods.    FOOTNOTE:    [4] The _Modern Review_, October, 1916.          THE MORAL BASIS OF CO-OPERATION[5]      The only claim I have on your indulgence is that some months ago I  attended with Mr. Ewbank a meeting of mill-hands to whom he wanted to  explain the principles of co-operation. The chawl in which they were  living was as filthy as it well could be. Recent rains had made matters  worse. And I must frankly confess that, had it not been for Mr. Ewbank's  great zeal for the cause he has made his own, I should have shirked the  task. But there we were, seated on a fairly worn-out _charpai_,  surrounded by men, women and children. Mr. Ewbank opened fire on a man  who had put himself forward and who wore not a particularly innocent  countenance. After he had engaged him and the other people about him in  Gujrati conversation, he wanted me to speak to the people. Owing to the  suspicious looks of the man who was first spoken to, I naturally pressed  home the moralities of co-operation. I fancy that Mr. Ewbank rather  liked the manner in which I handled the subject. Hence, I believe, his  kind invitation to me to tax your patience for a few moments upon a  consideration of co-operation from a moral standpoint.    My knowledge of the technicality of co-operation is next to nothing. My  brother, Devadhar, has made the subject his own. Whatever he does,  naturally attracts me and predisposes me to think that there must be  something good in it and the handling of it must be fairly difficult.  Mr. Ewbank very kindly placed at my disposal some literature too on the  subject. And I have had a unique opportunity of watching the effect of  some co-operative effort in Champaran. I have gone through Mr. Ewbank's  ten main points which are like the Commandments, and I have gone through  the twelve points of Mr. Collins of Behar, which remind me of the law of  the Twelve Tables. There are so-called agricultural banks in Champaran.  They were to me disappointing efforts, if they were meant to be  demonstrations of the success of co-operation. On the other hand, there  is quiet work in the same direction being done by Mr. Hodge, a  missionary whose efforts are leaving their impress on those who come in  contact with him. Mr. Hodge is a co-operative enthusiast and probably  considers that the result which he sees flowing from his efforts are due  to the working of co-operation. I, who was able to watch the efforts,  had no hesitation in inferring that the personal equation counted for  success in the one and failure in the other instance.    I am an enthusiast myself, but twenty-five years of experimenting and  experience have made me a cautious and discriminating enthusiast.  Workers in a cause necessarily, though quite unconsciously, exaggerate  its merits and often succeed in turning its very defects into  advantages. In spite of my caution I consider the little institution I  am conducting in Ahmedabad as the finest thing in the world. It alone  gives me sufficient inspiration. Critics tell me that it represents a  soulless soul-force and that its severe discipline has made it merely  mechanical. I suppose both--the critics and I--are wrong. It is, at  best, a humble attempt to place at the disposal of the nation a home  where men and women may have scope for free and unfettered development  of character, in keeping with the national genius, and, if its  controllers do not take care, the discipline that is the foundation of  character may frustrate the very end in view.

How had it happened  that this piece of patchwork had become the receptacle for the august  and infinite mysteries of the Christian Faith? This was the problem with  which Newman and his friends found themselves confronted. Other men  might, and apparently did, see nothing very strange in such a situation;  but other men saw in Christianity itself scarcely more than a convenient  and respectable appendage to existence, by which a sound system of  morals was inculcated, and through which one might hope to attain to  everlasting bliss.    To Newman and Keble it was otherwise. They saw a transcendent  manifestation of Divine power flowing down elaborate and immense through  the ages; a consecrated priesthood, stretching back, through the mystic  symbol of the laying on of hands, to the very Godhead; a whole universe  of spiritual beings brought into communion with the Eternal by means of  wafers; a great mass of metaphysical doctrines, at once incomprehensible  and of incalculable import, laid down with infinite certitude; they saw  the supernatural everywhere and at all times, a living force, floating  invisible in angels, inspiring saints, and investing with miraculous  properties the commonest material things. No wonder that they found such  a spectacle hard to bring into line with the institution which had been  evolved from the divorce of Henry VIII, the intrigues of Elizabethan  parliaments, and the Revolution of 1688. They did, no doubt, soon  satisfy themselves that they had succeeded in this apparently hopeless  task; but, the conclusions which they came to in order to do so were  decidedly startling.    The Church of England, they declared, was indeed the one true Church,  but she had been under an eclipse since the Reformation; in fact, since  she had begun to exist. She had, it is true, escaped the corruptions of  Rome; but she had become enslaved by the secular power, and degraded by  the false doctrines of Protestantism. The Christian Religion was still  preserved intact by the English priesthood, but it was preserved, as it  were, unconsciously--a priceless deposit, handed down blindly from  generation to generation, and subsisting less by the will of man than  through the ordinance of God as expressed in the mysterious virtue of  the Sacraments. Christianity, in short, had become entangled in a series  of unfortunate circumstances from which it was the plain duty of Newman  and his friends to rescue it forthwith. What was curious was that this  task had been reserved, in so marked a manner, for them. Some of the  divines of the seventeenth century had, perhaps, been vouchsafed  glimpses of the truth; but they were glimpses and nothing more. No, the  waters of the true Faith had dived underground at the Reformation, and  they were waiting for the wand of Newman to strike the rock before they  should burst forth once more into the light of day. The whole matter, no  doubt, was Providential--what other explanation could there be?    The first step, it was clear, was to purge the Church of her shames and  her errors. The Reformers must be exposed; the yoke of the secular power  must be thrown off; dogma must be reinstated in its old pre-eminence;  and Christians must be reminded of what they had apparently  forgotten--the presence of the supernatural in daily life. 'It would be  a gain to this country,' Keble observed, 'were it vastly more  superstitious, more bigoted, more gloomy, more fierce in its religion,  than at present it shows itself to be.' 'The only good I know of  Cranmer,' said Hurrell Froude, 'was that he burned well.' Newman  preached, and soon the new views began to spread. Among the earliest of  the converts was Dr Pusey, a man of wealth and learning, a professor, a  canon of Christ Church, who had, it was rumoured, been to Germany. Then  the Tracts for the Times were started under Newman's editorship, and the  Movement was launched upon the world.    The Tracts were written 'with the hope of rousing members of our Church  to comprehend her alarming position ... as a man might give notice of a  fire or inundation, to startle all who heard him'. They may be said to  have succeeded in their objective, for the sensation which they caused  among clergymen throughout the country was extreme. They dealt with a  great variety of questions, but the underlying intention of all of them  was to attack the accepted doctrines and practices of the Church of  England. Dr. Pusey wrote learnedly on Baptismal Regeneration; he also  wrote on Fasting. His treatment of the latter subject met with  considerable disapproval, which surprised the Doctor. 'I was not  prepared,' he said, 'for people questioning, even in the abstract, the  duty of fasting; I thought serious-minded persons at least supposed they  practised fasting in some way or other. I assumed the duty to be  acknowledged and thought it only undervalued.' We live and learn, even  though we have been to Germany.    Other tracts discussed the Holy Catholic Church, the Clergy, and the  Liturgy. One treated of the question 'whether a clergyman of the Church  of England be now bound to have morning and evening prayers daily in his  parish church?' Another pointed out the 'Indications of a superintending  Providence in the preservation of the Prayer-book and in the changes  which it has undergone'. Another consisted of a collection of 'Advent  Sermons on Antichrist'. Keble wrote a long and elaborate tract 'On the  Mysticism attributed to the Early Fathers of the Church', in which he  expressed his opinions upon a large number of curious matters.    'According to men's usual way of talking,' he wrote, 'it would be called  an accidental circumstance that there were five loaves, not more nor  less, in the store of Our Lord and His disciples wherewith to provide  the miraculous feast. But the ancient interpreters treat it as designed  and providential, in this surely not erring: and their conjecture is  that it represents the sacrifice of the whole world of sense, and  especially of the Old Dispensation, which, being outward and visible,  might be called the dispensation of the senses, to the FATHER of our  LORD JESUS CHRIST, to be a pledge and means of communion with Him  according to the terms of the new or evangelical law.    They arrived at this idea by considering the number five, the number of  the senses, as the mystical opponent of the visible and sensible  universe--ta aistheta, as distinguished from ta noita. Origen lays down  the rule in express terms. '\"The number five,\"' he says, '\"frequently,  nay almost always, is taken for the five senses.\"' In another passage,  Keble deals with an even more recondite question. He quotes the teaching  of St. Barnabas that 'Abraham, who first gave men circumcision, did  thereby perform a spiritual and typical action, looking forward to the  Son'. St. Barnabas's argument is as follows: Abraham circumcised of his  house men to the number of 318. Why 318? Observe first the 18, then the  300. Of the two letters which stand for 18, 10 is represented by 1, 8 by  H. 'Thou hast here,' says St. Barnabas, 'the word of Jesus.' As for the  300, 'the Cross is represented by Tau, and the letter Tau represents  that number'.    Unfortunately, however, St. Barnabas's premise was of doubtful validity,  as the Rev. Mr. Maitland pointed out, in a pamphlet impugning the  conclusions of the Tract. 'The simple fact is,' he wrote, 'that when  Abraham pursued Chedorlaomer \"he armed his trained servants, BORN IN HIS  OWN HOUSE, three hundred and eighteen\". When, more than thirteen  (according to the common chronology, fifteen) years after, he  circumcised \"all the men of his house, BORN IN THE HOUSE, AND BOUGHT  WITH MONEY OF THE STRANGER\", and, in fact, every male who was as much as  eight days old, we are not told what the number amounted to. Shall we  suppose (just for the sake of the interpretation) that Abraham's family  had so dwindled in the interval as that now all the males of his  household, trained men, slaves, and children, equalled only and exactly  the number of his warriors fifteen years before?'    The question seems difficult to answer, but Keble had, as a matter of  fact, forestalled the argument in the following passage, which had  apparently escaped the notice of the Rev. Mr. Maitland:    'Now whether the facts were really so or not (if it were, it was surely  by special providence), that Abraham's household at the time of the  circumcision was exactly the same number as before; still the argument  of St. Barnabas will stand. As thus: circumcision had from the  beginning, a reference to our SAVIOUR, as in other respects, so in this;  that the mystical number, which is the cipher of Jesus crucified, was  the number of the first circumcised household in the strength of which  Abraham prevailed against the powers of the world. So St. Clement of  Alexandria, as cited by Fell.'    And Keble supports his contention through ten pages of close print, with  references to Aristeas, St. Augustine, St. Jerome, and Dr. Whitby.    Writings of this kind could not fail in their effect. Pious youths in  Oxford were carried away by them, and began to flock around the standard  of Newman. Newman himself became a party chief--encouraging, organising,  persuading. His long black figure, swiftly passing through the streets,  was pointed at with awe; crowds flocked to his sermons; his words were  repeated from mouth to mouth; 'Credo in Newmannum' became a common  catchword. Jokes were made about the Church of England, and practices,  unknown for centuries, began to be revived. Young men fasted and did  penance, recited the hours of the Roman Breviary, and confessed their  sins to Dr. Pusey. Nor was the movement confined to Oxford; it spread in  widening circles through the parishes of England; the dormant devotion  of the country was suddenly aroused. The new strange notion of taking  Christianity literally was"]]]
