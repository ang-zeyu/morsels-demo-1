How could turkeys  have ghosts if they don't have souls, I should like to know?\"    \"Oh, easily,\" said the papa.    \"Tell how,\" said the little girl.    \"Now look here,\" said the papa, \"are you telling this story, or am I?\"    \"You are,\" said the little girl, and she cuddled down again. \"Go on.\"    \"Well, then, don't you interrupt. Where was I? Oh yes.\"      Well, he couldn't do anything with them, old First Premium couldn't.    They acted perfectly ridiculous, and one little brat of a spiteful    little chick piped out, \"I speak for a drumstick, ma!\" and then they    all began: \"I want a wing, ma!\" and \"I'm going to have the wish-bone!\"    and \"I shall have just as much stuffing as ever I please, shan't I,    ma?\" till the other little girl was perfectly disgusted with them; she    thought they oughtn't to say it before her, anyway; but she had hardly    thought this before they all screamed out, \"They used to say it before    _us_,\" and then she didn't know what to say, because she knew how    people talked before animals.    \"I don't believe I ever did,\" said the little girl. \"Go on.\"      Well, old First Premium tried to quiet them again, and when he    couldn't he apologized to the other little girl so nicely that she    began to like him. He said they didn't mean any harm by it; they were    just excited, and chickledren would be chickledren.      \"Yes,\" said the other little girl, \"but I think you might take some    older person to begin with. It's a perfect shame to begin with a    little girl.\"      \"Begin!\" says old First Premium. \"Do you think we're just _beginning_?    Why, when do you think it is?\"      \"The night after Thanksgiving.\"      \"What year?\"      \"1886.\"      They all gave a perfect screech. \"Why, it's Christmas Eve, 1900, and    every one of your friends has been eaten up long ago,\" says old First    Premium, and he began to cry over her, and the old hen-turkey and the    little turkey chicks began to wipe their eyes on the backs of their    wings.    \"I don't think they were very neat,\" said the little girl.    Well, they were kind-hearted, anyway, and they felt sorry for the other  little girl. And she began to think she had made some little impression  on them, when she noticed the old hen-turkey beginning to untie her  bonnet strings, and the turkey chicks began to spread round her in a  circle, with the points of their wings touching, so that she couldn't  get out, and they commenced dancing and singing, and after a while that  little he-turkey says, \"Who's _it_?\" and the other little girl, she  didn't know why, says, \"_I'm_ it,\" and old First Premium says, \"Do you  promise?\" and the other little girl says, \"Yes, I promise,\" and she knew  she was promising, if they would let her go, that people should never  eat turkeys any more. And the moon began to shine brighter and brighter  through the turkeys, and pretty soon it was the sun, and then it was not  the turkeys, but the window-curtains--it was one of those old  farm-houses where they don't have blinds--and the other little girl--    \"Woke up!\" shouted the little girl. \"There now, papa, what did I tell  you? I _knew_ it was a dream all along.\"    \"No, she didn't,\" said the papa; \"and it wasn't a dream.\"    \"What was it, then?\"    \"It was a--trance.\"    The little girl turned round, and knelt in her papa's lap, so as to take  him by the shoulders and give him a good shaking. That made him promise  to be good, pretty quick, and, \"Very well, then,\" says the little girl;  \"if it wasn't a dream, you've got to prove it.\"    \"But how can I prove it?\" says the papa.    \"By going on with the story,\" says the little girl, and she cuddled down  again.    \"Oh, well, that's easy enough.\"      As soon as it was light in the room, the other little girl could see    that the place was full of people, crammed and jammed, and they were    all awfully excited, and kept yelling, \"Down with the traitress!\"    \"Away with the renegade!\" \"Shame on the little sneak!\" till it was    worse than the turkeys, ten times.      She knew that they meant her, and she tried to explain that she just    _had_ to promise, and that if they had been in her place they would    have promised too; and of course they could do as they pleased about    keeping her word, but she was going to keep it, anyway, and never,    never, never eat another piece of turkey either at Thanksgiving or at    Christmas.      \"Very well, then,\" says an old lady, who looked like her grandmother,    and then began to have a crown on, and to turn into Queen Victoria,    \"what _can_ we have?\"      \"Well,\" says the other little girl, \"you can have oyster soup.\"      \"What else?\"      \"And you can have cranberry sauce.\"      \"What else?\"      \"You can have mashed potatoes, and Hubbard squash, and celery, and    turnip, and cauliflower.\"      \"What else?\"      \"You can have mince-pie, and pandowdy, and plum-pudding.\"      \"And not a thing on the list,\" says the Queen, \"that doesn't go with    turkey! Now you see.\"    The papa stopped.    \"Go on,\" said the little girl.    \"There isn't any more.\"    The little girl turned round, got up on her knees, took him by the  shoulders, and shook him fearfully. \"Now, then,\" she said, while the  papa let his head wag, after the shaking, like a Chinese mandarin's, and  it was a good thing he did not let his tongue stick out. \"Now, will you  go on? What _did_ the people eat in place of turkey?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"You don't know, you awful papa! Well, then, what did the little girl  eat?\"    \"She?\" The papa freed himself, and made his preparation to escape. \"Why  she--oh, _she_ ate goose. Goose is tenderer than turkey, anyway, and  more digestible; and there isn't so much of it, and you can't overeat  yourself, and have bad--\"    \"Dreams!\" cried the little girl.    \"Trances,\" said the papa, and she began to chase him all round the  room.          THE PONY ENGINE AND THE PACIFIC EXPRESS.      Christmas Eve, after the children had hung up their stockings and got  all ready for St. Nic, they climbed up on the papa's lap to kiss him  good-night, and when they both got their arms round his neck, they said  they were not going to bed till he told them a Christmas story. Then he  saw that he would have to mind, for they were awfully severe with him,  and always made him do exactly what they told him; it was the way they  had brought him up. He tried his best to get out of it for a while; but  after they had shaken him first this side, and then that side, and  pulled him backward and forward till he did not know where he was, he  began to think perhaps he had better begin. The first thing he said,  after he opened his eyes, and made believe he had been asleep, or  something, was, \"Well, what did I leave off at?\" and that made them just  perfectly boiling, for they understood his tricks, and they knew he was  trying to pretend that he had told part of the story already; and they  said he had not left off anywhere because he had not commenced, and he  saw it was no use. So he commenced.    \"Once there was a little Pony Engine that used to play round the  Fitchburg Depot on the side tracks, and sleep in among the big  locomotives in the car-house--\"    The little girl lifted her head from the papa's shoulder, where she had  dropped it. \"Is it a sad story, papa?\"    \"How is it going to end?\" asked the boy.    \"Well, it's got a moral,\" said the papa.    \"Oh, all right, if it's got a moral,\" said the children; they had a good  deal of fun with the morals the papa put to his stories. The boy added,  \"Go on,\" and the little girl prompted, \"Car-house.\"    The papa said, \"Now every time you stop me I shall have to begin all  over again.\" But he saw that this was not going to spite them any, so he  went on: \"One of the locomotives was its mother, and she had got hurt  once in a big smash-up, so that she couldn't run long trips any more.  She was so weak in the chest you could hear her wheeze as far as you  could see her. But she could work round the depot, and pull empty cars  in and out, and shunt them off on the side tracks; and she was so  anxious to be useful that all the other engines respected her, and they  were very kind to the little Pony Engine on her account, though it was  always getting in the way, and under their wheels, and everything. They  all knew it was an orphan, for before its mother got hurt its father  went through a bridge one dark night into an arm of the sea, and was  never heard of again; he was supposed to have been drowned. The old  mother locomotive used to say that it would never have happened if she  had been there; but poor dear No. 236 was always so venturesome, and she  had warned him against that very bridge time and again. Then she would  whistle so dolefully, and sigh with her air-brakes enough to make  anybody cry. You see they used to be a very happy family when they were  all together, before the papa locomotive got drowned. He was very fond  of the little Pony Engine, and told it stories at night after they got  into the car-house, at the end of some of his long runs. It would get up  on his cow-catcher, and lean its chimney up against his, and listen till  it fell asleep. Then he would put it softly down, and be off again in  the morning before it was awake. I tell you, those were happy days for  poor No. 236. The little Pony Engine could just remember him; it was  awfully proud of its papa.\"    The boy lifted his head and looked at the little girl, who suddenly hid  her face in the papa's other shoulder. \"Well, I declare, papa, she was  putting up her lip.\"    \"I wasn't, any such thing!\" said the little girl. \"And I don't care!  So!\" and then she sobbed.    \"Now, never you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],[0,"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#4)"],[1,"the ring. Suddenly there was heard a deep baying sound, which  struck terror into every heart. It was the lion; but seemed close at  hand. In an instant a dark, cat-like form, rushing down the aisle,  sprang into the ring.    The great Numidian lion had broken from his cage, and the life of every  one in the audience was in peril. Ladies shrieked, strong men grew pale,  and all wildly looked about for some way of escape.    Striking down the clown, and standing with one foot on the prostrate  form, the lion's cruel eyes wandered slowly over the vast assemblage.    Only ten feet from him, in front seats, sat Kit and Dan.    Kit rose in his seat pale and excited, but with a resolute fire in his  eyes. He had thought of a way to vanquish the lion.          CHAPTER V.    HOW KIT VANQUISHED THE LION.      The danger was imminent. Under the canvas there were at least two  thousand spectators. Smyrna had less than five thousand inhabitants, but  from towns around there were numerous excursion parties, which helped to  swell the number present. Had these people foreseen the terrible scene  not down on the bills, they would have remained at home and locked the  doors of their houses. But danger is seldom anticipated and peril  generally finds us unprepared.    Dan Clark saw Kit about to leave his seat.    \"Where are you going?\" he cried.    \"I am going into the arena.\"    \"What? Are you out of your head?\" asked Dan, and he took hold of Kit to  detain him. But the boy tore himself from the grasp of his friend, and  with blanched brow, for he knew full well the risk he ran, he sprang  over the parapet, and in an instant he stood in the sawdust circle  facing the angry monarch of the wilds, whose presence had struck terror  into the hearts of two thousand members of a superior race.    The sudden movement of Kit created a sensation only less than the  appearance of the lion.    The residents of Smyrna all knew him, but they could not understand the  cause of his apparent fool-hardiness.    \"Come back! Come away, for your life!\" exclaimed dozens of Kit's friends  and acquaintances.    \"Who is that boy? Is he one of the circus men?\" asked strangers who were  present.    \"You will be killed, Kit! Come back!\" implored Dan Clark, appalled at  the danger of his friend.    Kit heard, but did not heed, the various calls. He knew what he was  about, and he did not mean to be killed. But there seemed the greatest  danger of it. He was six feet from the angry beast, who lashed his tail  with renewed wrath, when he saw his new and puny foe. Kit knew, however,  that the lion's method of attack is to spring upon his victims, and that  he needs a space of from twelve to fifteen feet to do it. He himself,  being but six feet distant, was within the necessary space. The lion  must increase the distance between them in order to accomplish its  purpose.    Now it happened that Mr. Watson had in his kitchen an elderly woman, who  had for years been addicted to the obnoxious habit of snuff taking--a  habit, I am glad to be able to say, which is far less prevalent now than  in former days. Just before Kit had started for the circus, Ellen, who  was a Scotch woman, said: \"Master Kit, if you are going near the store,  will you buy me a quarter of a pound of snuff?\"    \"Certainly, Ellen,\" answered Kit, who was always obliging.    The snuff he had in his pocket at the time of the lion's appearance in  the ring, and it was the thought of this unusual but formidable weapon  that gave him courage. If he had merely had a pistol or revolver in his  pocket, he would not have ventured, for he knew that a wound would only  make the lion fiercer and more dangerous.    The lion stood stock still for a moment. Apparently he was amazed at the  daring of the boy who had rushed into his presence. His fierce eyes  began to roll wickedly and he uttered one of those deep, hoarse growls,  such as are wont to strike fear alike into animals and men. He glared at  Kit very much as a cat surveys a puny mouse whom she purposes to make  her victim.    It was a few brief seconds, but to the audience, who were spellbound,  and scarcely dared to breathe, it seemed as many minutes that the boy  and lion stood confronting each other without moving. Indeed, Kit stood  as if fascinated before the mighty beast, and a thrill passed through  his frame as he realized the terrible danger into which he had  impulsively rushed. But he knew full well that his peril was each  instant growing greater. He could not retreat now, for the furious beast  would improve the chance to spring upon him and rend him to pieces.    With curious deliberation he drew from his pocket a paper parcel, while  the lion, as if stirred by curiosity, eyed him attentively. He opened it  carefully, and then, without an instant's delay, he flung a handful of  the snuff which it contained full in the eyes of the terrible animal.    No sooner had he done so than he gave a spring, and in a flash was over  the parapet and back in his seat.    It was not a moment too soon!    The lion was blinded by the snuff, which caused him intense pain. He  released the terrified clown, who lost no time in escaping from the  arena, while the vanquished beast rolled around on the sawdust in his  agony, sending forth meanwhile the most terrible roars.    By this time the circus management had recovered from its momentary  panic. The trainer and half a dozen animal men (those whose duty it was  to take care of the animals) rushed into the circle, and soon obtained  the mastery of the lion, whose pain had subdued his fury, and who was  now moaning piteously.    Then through the crowded tent there ran a thrill of admiration for the  boy who had delivered them all from a terrible danger.    One man, an enthusiastic Western visitor, sprang to his feet, and,  waving his hat, exclaimed: \"Three cheers for the brave boy, who has  shown more courage than all the rest of us put together! Hip, hip,  hurrah!\"    The call was responded to with enthusiasm. Men and even women rose in  their seats, and joined in the cheering. But some of the friends of Kit  amended the suggestion by crying, \"Hurrah for Kit Watson!\"    \"Hurrah for Kit Watson!\" cried the Western man. \"He's the pluckiest kid  I ever saw yet.\"    Kit had not been frightened before, but he felt undeniably nervous when  he saw the eyes of two thousand people fixed upon him. He blushed and  seemed disposed to screen himself from observation. But at this moment a  tall, portly man advanced from the front of the tent, and came up to  where Kit was sitting.    \"My boy,\" he said, \"do me the favor to follow me. I am Mr. Barlow.\"    It was indeed the proprietor of the circus. He had come in person to  greet the boy who had averted such a tragedy.    Mechanically Kit followed Mr. Barlow, who led him again into the arena.  Then the manager cleared his throat, and said:    \"Ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing to show you here to-night that is  better worth your attention than the young man whose heroic act you  have just witnessed and profited by. I introduce to you the boy hero,  Kit Watson!\"    \"Speech! speech!\" exclaimed the spectators, after a liberal meed of  applause.    Kit stood erect, and spoke modestly.    \"I don't pretend to be a hero,\" he said. \"I was as much frightened as  anybody, but I thought of the snuff in my pocket, and I recalled to mind  a story of a man who subdued a lunatic by means of it. So, on the  impulse of the moment, I jumped into the ring. I am very much obliged to  you for your cheers, and I wish I was as brave as you seem to think. I  won't take up any more of your time, for I know you want the show to go  on.\"    Kit retired amid a burst of applause, and resumed his seat.    The entertainment of the evening now proceeded, greatly to the  satisfaction of the crowded ranks of spectators. But from time to time  glances were cast towards the seat which Kit occupied.    \"Kit,\" whispered Dan, \"I am proud of you! I didn't think you had it in  you.\"    \"Don't say any more, Dan, or I shall become so vain you can't endure me.  Look! there are our friends, the acrobats.\"          CHAPTER VI.    KIT'S POOR PROSPECTS.      There was one of the spectators who did not admire Kit's heroic conduct,  nor join in the applause which was so liberally showered upon him. This  was Ralph Watson, who sat on the opposite side of the tent, with his  chum, James Schuyler, a boy who had recently come to Smyrna from the  city of New York. Ralph had been very pale when the lion first made his  appearance in the arena, and trembled with fear, and no one had felt  greater relief when the danger was past. But, being naturally of a  jealous disposition, he was very much annoyed by the sudden popularity  won by Kit.    \"Isn't that your cousin?\" asked James Schuyler.    \"Yes,\" answered Ralph shortly.    \"What a brave boy he is!\"    Ralph shrugged his shoulders.    \"I don't see much bravery about it,\" he said. \"It isn't as if the lion  was a wild one in his native forest. This one was tame.\"    \"He didn't look very tame to me,\" rejoined James, who, though rather  snobbish, was willing to admit the danger they had all incurred. \"The  people didn't think so either. Hear them cheer your cousin.\"    \"It will make him terribly conceited. He will actually think he's a  hero.\"    \"I wouldn't have given much for any of our lives if he hadn't jumped  into the ring, and blinded the lion.\"    Meanwhile Kit was enjoying the performance, and thinking very little of  how his action would be regarded by Ralph, for whom he had no very  cordial feeling, though they had been, from the necessity of the case,  close companions for many years.    On their return home, Kit and Ralph reached the gate together.    \"It seems you're a great hero all at once,\" said Ralph, with a sneer.    Kit understood the sneer, but did not choose to notice it.    \"Thank you for the compliment,\" he responded quietly.    \"O, I didn't "]]]
