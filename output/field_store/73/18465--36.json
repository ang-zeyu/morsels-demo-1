Soon the two sailors,  thinking him asleep, joined the pilot, and sitting down beside the helm,  they began to consult together.    \"You were wrong, Langlade,\" said Donadieu, \"in choosing a craft like  this, which is either too small or else too big; in an open boat we can  never weather a storm, and without oars we can never make any way in a  calm.\"    \"'Fore God! I had no choice. I was obliged to take what I could get, and  if it had not been the season for tunny-fishing I might not even have  got this wretched pinnace, or rather I should have had to go into the  harbour to find it, and they keep such a sharp lookout that I might well  have gone in without coming out again.\"    \"At least it is seaworthy,\" said Blancard.    \"Pardieu, you know what nails and planks are when they have been soaked  in sea-water for ten years. On any ordinary occasion, a man would rather  not go in her from Marseilles to the Chateau d'If, but on an occasion  like this one would willingly go round the world in a nutshell.\"    \"Hush!\" said Donadieu. The sailors listened; a distant growl was heard,  but it was so faint that only the experienced ear of a sailor could have  distinguished it.    \"Yes, yes,\" said Langlade, \"it is a warning for those who have legs or  wings to regain the homes and nests that they ought never to have left.\"    \"Are we far from the islands?\" asked Donadieu quickly.    \"About a mile off.\"    \"Steer for them.\"    \"What for?\" asked Murat, looking up.    \"To put in there, sire, if we can.\"    \"No, no,\" cried Murat; \"I will not land except in Corsica. I will not  leave France again. Besides, the sea is calm and the wind is getting up  again--\"    \"Down with the sails!\" shouted Donadieu. Instantly Langlade and Blancard  jumped forward to carry out the order. The sail slid down the mast and  fell in a heap in the bottom of the boat.    \"What are you doing?\" cried Murat. \"Do you forget that I am king and  that I command you?\"    \"Sire,\" said Donadieu, \"there is a king more powerful than you--God;  there is a voice which drowns yours--the voice of the tempest: let us  save your Majesty if possible, and demand nothing more of us.\"    Just then a flash of lightning quivered along the horizon, a clap of  thunder nearer than the first one was heard, a light foam appeared on  the surface of the water, and the boat trembled like a living thing.  Murat began to understand that danger was approaching, then he got up  smiling, threw his hat behind him, shook back his long hair, and  breathed in the storm like the smell of powder--the soldier was ready  for the battle.    \"Sire,\" said Donadieu, \"you have seen many a battle, but perhaps you  have never watched a storm if you are curious about it, cling to the  mast, for you have a fine opportunity now.\"    \"What ought I to do?\" said Murat. \"Can I not help you in any way?\"    \"No, not just now, sire; later you will be useful at the pumps.\"    During this dialogue the storm had drawn near; it rushed on the  travellers like a war-horse, breathing out fire and wind through its  nostrils, neighing like thunder, and scattering the foam of the waves  beneath its feet.    Donadieu turned the rudder, the boat yielded as if it understood the  necessity for prompt obedience, and presented the poop to the shock of  wind; then the squall passed, leaving the sea quivering, and everything  was calm again. The storm took breath.    \"Will that gust be all?\" asked Murat.    \"No, your Majesty, that was the advance-guard only; the body of the army  will be up directly.\"    \"And are you not going to prepare for it?\" asked the king gaily.    \"What could we do?\" said Donadieu. \"We have not an inch of canvas to  catch the wind, and as long as we do not make too much water, we shall  float like a cork. Look out-sire!\"    Indeed, a second hurricane was on its way, bringing rain and lightning;  it was swifter than the first. Donadieu endeavoured to repeat the same  manoeuvre, but he could not turn before the wind struck the boat, the  mast bent like a reed; the boat shipped a wave.    \"To the pumps!\" cried Donadieu. \"Sire, now is the moment to help us--\"    Blancard, Langlade, and Murat seized their hats and began to bale out  the boat. The position of the four men was terrible--it lasted three  hours.    At dawn the wind fell, but the sea was still high. They began to feel  the need of food: all the provisions had been spoiled by sea-water, only  the wine had been preserved from its contact.    The king took a bottle and swallowed a little wine first, then he passed  it to his companions, who drank in their turn: necessity had overcome  etiquette. By chance Langlade had on him a few chocolates, which he  offered to the king. Murat divided them into four equal parts, and  forced his companions to take their shares; then, when the meal was  over, they steered for Corsica, but the boat had suffered so much that  it was improbable that it would reach Bastia.    The whole day passed without making ten miles; the boat was kept under  the jib, as they dared not hoist the mainsail, and the wind was so  variable that much time was lost in humouring its caprices.    By evening the boat had drawn a considerable amount of water, it  penetrated between the boards, the handkerchiefs of the crew served to  plug up the leaks, and night, which was descending in mournful gloom,  wrapped them a second time in darkness. Prostrated with fatigue, Murat  fell asleep, Blancard and Langlade took their places beside Donadieu,  and the three men, who seemed insensible to the calls of sleep and  fatigue, watched over his slumbers.    The night was calm enough apparently, but low grumblings were heard now  and then.    The three sailors looked at each other strangely and then at the king,  who was sleeping at the bottom of the boat, his cloak soaked with  sea-water, sleeping as soundly as he had slept on the sands of Egypt or  the snows of Russia.    Then one of them got up and went to the other end of the boat, whistling  between his teeth a Provencal air; then, after examining the sky, the  waves; and the boat, he went back to his comrades and sat down,  muttering, \"Impossible! Except by a miracle, we shall never make the  land.\"    The night passed through all its phases. At dawn there was a vessel in  sight.    \"A sail!\" cried Donadieu,--\"a sail!\"    At this cry the king--awoke; and soon a little trading brig hove in  sight, going from Corsica to Toulon.    Donadieu steered for the brig, Blancard hoisted enough sail to work the  boat, and Langlade ran to the prow and held up the king's cloak on the  end of a sort of harpoon. Soon the voyagers perceived that they had been  sighted, the brig went about to approach them, and in ten minutes they  found themselves within fifty yards of it. The captain appeared in the  bows. Then the king hailed him and offered him a substantial reward if  he would receive them on board and take them to Corsica. The captain  listened to the proposal; then immediately turning to the crew, he gave  an order in an undertone which Donadieu could not hear, but which he  understood probably by the gesture, for he instantly gave Langlade and  Blancard the order to make away from the schooner. They obeyed with the  unquestioning promptitude of sailors; but the king stamped his foot.    \"What are you doing, Donadieu? What are you about? Don't you see that  she is coming up to us?\"    \"Yes--upon my soul--so she is.... Do as I say, Langlade; ready,  Blancard. Yes, she is coming upon us, and perhaps I was too late in  seeing this. That's all right--that's all right: my part now.\"    Then he forced over the rudder, giving it so violent a jerk that the  boat, forced to change her course suddenly, seemed to rear and plunge  like a horse struggling against the curb; finally she obeyed. A huge  wave, raised by the giant bearing down on the pinnace, carried it on  like a leaf, and the brig passed within a few feet of the stern.    \"Ah!.... traitor!\" cried the king, who had only just begun to realise  the intention of the captain. At the same time, he pulled a pistol from  his belt, crying \"Board her! board her!\" and tried to fire on the brig,  but the powder was wet and would not catch. The king was furious, and  went on shouting \"Board her! board her!\"    \"Yes, the wretch, or rather the imbecile,\" said Donadieu, \"he took us  for pirates, and wanted to sink us--as if we needed him to do that!\"    Indeed, a single glance at the boat showed that she was beginning to  make water.    The effort--to escape which Donadieu had made had strained the boat  terribly, and the water was pouring in by a number of leaks between the  planks; they had to begin again bailing out with their hats, and went on  at it for ten hours. Then for the second time Donadieu heard the  consoling cry, \"A sail! a sail!\" The king and his companions immediately  left off bailing; they hoisted the sails again, and steered for the  vessel which was coming towards them, and neglected to fight against the  water, which was rising rapidly.    From that time forth it was a question of time, of minutes, of seconds;  it was a question of reaching the ship before the boat foundered.    The vessel, however, seemed to understand the desperate position of the  men imploring help; she was coming up at full speed. Langlade was the  first to recognise her; she was a Government felucca plying between  Toulon and Bastia. Langlade was a friend of the captain, and he called  his name with the penetrating voice of desperation, and he was heard. It  was high time: the water kept on rising, and the king and his companions  were already up to their knees; the boat groaned in its death-struggle;  it stood still, and began to go round and round.

The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the  entry:       acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish  and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid  rain).       acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly  to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH  scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered  alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note  - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in  New England.       aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas,  smoke, or fog.       afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by  planting trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on  areas that have been cut or destroyed by fire.       asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly  used in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic  in particulate form.       biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.       bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence,  abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.       biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given  area or volume.       carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon  (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere,  ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.       catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited  freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.       DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was  banned in the US in 1972.       defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.       deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,  and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without  planting new growth.       desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or  semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive  soils, or climate change.       dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,  shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.       drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is  generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often  results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-  commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the  ocean clean\".       ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of  organisms and their specific environments.       effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial  waste, which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting  it.       endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.       freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.       greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the  lower atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary  greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.       groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth  often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the  source for wells and natural springs.       Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly  and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it  forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders  economic resources.       Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 125,000 Inuits  of Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental  issues; a panel convenes every three years to determine the focus of  the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of  pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.       metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.       noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.       overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than  it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.       ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas  (O3) that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.       poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern  with respect to endangered or threatened species.       pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.       potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.       salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water  becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse  process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by  evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.       siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become  clotted with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil  erosion.       slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in  which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for  temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines  at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this  practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is  permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these  conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences  for the environment .       soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity  because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of  pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or  erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce  agricultural products.       soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,  and desertification.       ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic  energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper  atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living  organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in  humans.       water-born diseases - those in which the bacteria survive in, and  is transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.
