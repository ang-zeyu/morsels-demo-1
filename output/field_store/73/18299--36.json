There were those on the platform not so happy as we were; an old lady I  saw held the hand of a young soldier in pathetic silence, and the smiles  on the faces of those left at home were not particularly cheerful, and  the grey set expression of men leaving wives and children is hard to  forget. A younger lady I saw on the platform smiling, and straight as a  soldier, threw herself into her sister's arms as the train moved off in  a perfect abandonment of grief, and the wrinkles in the old lady's face  as we passed were full of tears--two to one against her seeing the young  man, son, or grandson, on this side. But I suppose that is India all  over--many partings, a few tears shed, and enough kept back to float a  fleet.    Our 'guid brither'[1] and his wife have come in the train with us to  Tilbury to see us on board, so we are all very jolly and the sun shines  bright on the river and white cumulous clouds, and the brown sails of  the barges are swelling with a brisk north-east breeze as they come up  on the top of the flood. The \"Egypt\" lies in mid-stream, and all the  passengers of our train go off to it in tenders, along with hundreds of  friends who have come to see them off--there is a crowd! Passengers only  bring hand baggage with them, the rest went on board yesterday; the  embarkation is beautifully managed and orderly, there is an astonishing  repression of excitement and show of out of place feeling. To compare  this embarkation with that on a foreign liner; I have seen the whole  business of taking passengers and luggage on board an Italian liner  stopped for minutes by one Egyptian with a tin of milk on the gangway,  holding forth on his grievances to the world at large, whilst handsome  officers on deck smiled futilely, their white-gloved hands behind their  backs. I suppose it is this military precision that gives the P. & O.  their name and their passengers a sense of security; but there are  people so hard to please that they ask for less pipeclay, less crowded  cabins, and better service and more deck space, and these carpers will  never be content, so long as they see other lines, such as the Japanese,  giving all they clamour for, comfortable bath-rooms, beds, and a laundry  at moderate rates.    [1] Brother-in-law.    A touch of militarism that I rather fancy on the P. & O. is the bugle  call going round the ship before meals; it is such a jolly cheery sound  to awaken to. It comes from far along the ship in the morning, at first  faintly in the distance, when you are half-awake trying to account for  the faint sound of machinery and the running reflections on your white  roof, dimly conscious of the ever delightful feeling that you are  sailing south across the widest and most level of all plains. Louder and  louder it comes along the alley-way, till outside your cabin door it  fairly makes you jump! A jolly, cheery sound it is, almost nothing in  the world so stirring excepting the pipes. There's a laughing brazen  defiance in it, and gentleness too, as it dies away--most masculine  music! What associations it must have for soldiers; even to the man of  peace it suggests plate armour, the listed field and battles long  ago.... Did you ever hear it in Edinburgh? up in the empty, windy castle  esplanade--empty of all but memories--You see no bugler, but the wide  grey walls and sky are filled with its golden notes. It echoes for a  moment, and then there is quietness, till the noise of the town comes up  again. And at night have you heard it? from the _Far Side_ of Princes  Street, the ethereal notes between you and the stars, long drawn notes  of the last post, from an invisible bugler in the loom of the rock and  the rolling clouds.    G. murmurs, \"It is abominable--but after all, going to sea is all a  matter of endurance.\" What a difference there is in the point of  view--G., I must say, had a hair mattress last night, and it was not  properly blanketted and entailed a certain amount of endurance; on the  other hand she is extremely fortunate in having such glorious pink roses  and beautiful hangings for nicknacks, touching parting gifts from  friends, so her cabin already looks fairly homely; and then, on the  walls, there is the most perfect round picture, framed in the bright  brass of the porthole--a sailing ship hull down on the horizon, her  sails shining like gold in the morning sun, on a sea of mother of  pearl.... There is just the faintest rise and fall, and the air is full  of the steady silky rushing sound; what is there like it, which you hear  in fine weather when the sea makes way to let you pass.    Painted at a sketch to-day of people coming on board the \"Egypt\" from  the tender, no great thing in colour, less in a black and white  reproduction, for eye and hand were a little taken up with luggage--a  note of lascars in blue dungarees and red turbans--East meeting  West--the Indies in mauve and lilac hats and white veils; for shades of  purple are all the fashion this year.       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    [Illustration]    I have found a corner in the waist between first and second class,  where one can draw or paint without being very much overlooked; you can  get under the sky there, elsewhere you can't, and only see the horizon,  for our first class deck is under the officers' deck, and the second  class is covered with awnings, a very poor arrangement I think for you  only get light on your toes. A sailing ship's deck is ever so much  nicer, for you have a reasonable bulwark to keep wind and water off your  body instead of an open rail. You can look over a bulwark comfortably,  your eyes sheltered from the glare off the sea; on these steam-liners it  comes slanting up to your eyes under eyebrows and eyelashes--no wonder  people take to blue spectacles! In the sailing ship too you can look up  and watch the bends of white canvas and the spars-and cordage swinging  to and fro across the infinite blue, an endless delight! Here you have a  floor and blistered paint a few inches above you, on which you know the  officers promenade with the full sweep of the horizon round them and the  arc of the sky above. Still another advantage of the sailing ship is,  that you are not just one of a crowd, ticketed No. so and so, bedded,  fed, and checked off by a numeral; and you can generally count on a  barometer, and learn the names of lights and lands you pass; possibly  there may even be a thermometer, and certainly a compass. On this  \"Egypt,\" barring a small scale Mercator's projection of the world on  which the ship's position is marked daily, there is no means of getting  the information that can make a sea voyage so infinitely interesting. I  would suggest large sized charts showing landmarks, ship's position, and  barometrical readings. What is more interesting at sea than the charts  of ocean depths, currents, winds, salinity, and temperature! If you go  too fast to touch on Plankton, Nekton, and Benthos, at least let the  poor first class passengers have a compass, if not a barograph and a  thermometer, to eke out conversations on the weather, the day's run, and  bridge.       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    \"THE BAY\"--the Great Bay, calm as a mill pond--there's a jolly sense of  rest and peace on board; I suppose everyone knows that feeling who has  gone East. For weeks you have been doing things, shopping, packing,  keeping appointments, then you get out of the bustle of town, breathe  again clear air, and rest, on the level sea, that lovely water cushion,  the most soothing of all beds.    Everyone is soporific and very restful. We begin to distinguish  individuals amongst the many passengers, but so far no one seems  particularly conspicuous. They are rather good-looking as a crowd, and  one or two children are like angels--at least we hope so.    It is darker ahead now and to the east, the shadow of the World on  Nothing, I suppose! possibly an October breeze coming--low banks of  cirri-cumuli above the horizon--clear overhead with streaks of rusty red  cloud fine as hair--the evening is cold, here is an attempt at it with a  brush. And we had music in the place for music on deck; an Irish lady  played the fiddle and played so well with a piano accompaniment to an  audience of six--if the Bay keeps quite the audience ought to increase.  After the sunset, dinner--what a tedious business it is; the waiting is  perfectly planned, but the waiters themselves have to wait ages at the  two service hatches, where they get all jammed together, so the time  between the courses seems interminable; you almost forget you are at a  meal at all. To-night dinner and conversation both hang fire at our end  of the table, and I overhear from the other end where my cousin sits  interesting scraps about India, which is distinctly annoying; R. is  relating some of his experiences there that set his neighbours and my  niece and Mrs Deputy-Commissioner all chuckling.    [Illustration]    I gather that R. converted a certain Swiss. They lived near each other,  a lonely life on the \"Black Cotton Soil,\" whatever that is. R. says it  blows about like snow. The Swiss lived in a little corrugated-iron house  with some hens, and no books, and he loved books, and hated his house  and hens, and the British Empire. R. had a nice bungalow and lots of  books, and he lent these to the Swiss, on condition that he would read  our newspapers! with the result that the Swiss ceased to believe in  British \"methods of barbarism,\" said he admired the Empire, and got  quite to like his tin house and the black soil,--even his hens!    It is so quiet in the smoking-room to-night--not even bridge going on  yet, which perhaps accounts for the discursiveness of these rambling  notes on a quiet Saturday night at sea.    Now comes Sunday. \"Come day go"]]]
