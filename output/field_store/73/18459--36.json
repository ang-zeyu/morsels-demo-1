Melville then replied, smiling, that being in  possession of the original she might well part with the copy; but  Elizabeth would on no account consent. This little discussion ended, she  showed him the portrait of Mary Stuart, which she kissed very tenderly,  expressing to Melville a great wish to see his mistress. \"That is very  easy, madam,\" he replied: \"keep your room, on the pretext that you are  indisposed, and set out incognito for Scotland, as King James V set out  for France when he wanted to see Madeleine de Valois, whom he afterwards  married.\"    \"Alas!\" replied Elizabeth, \"I would like to do so, but it is not so easy  as you think. Nevertheless, tell your queen that I love her tenderly,  and that I wish we could live more in friendship than we have done up to  the present\". Then passing to a subject which she seemed to have wanted  to broach for a long time, \"Melville,\" she continued, \"tell me frankly,  is my sister as beautiful as they say?\"    \"She has that reputation,\" replied Melville; \"but I cannot give your  Majesty any idea of her beauty, having no point of comparison.\"    \"I will give you one,\" the queen said. \"Is she more beautiful than I?\"    \"Madam,\" replied Melville, \"you are the most beautiful woman in England,  and Mary Stuart is the most beautiful woman in Scotland.\"    \"Then which of the two is the taller?\" asked Elizabeth, who was not  entirely satisfied by this answer, clever as it was.    \"My mistress, madam,\" responded Melville; \"I am obliged to confess it.\"    \"Then she is too tall,\" Elizabeth said sharply, \"for I am tall enough.  And what are her favourite amusements?\" she continued.    \"Madam,\" Melville replied, \"hunting, riding, performing on the lute and  the harpsichord.\"    \"Is she skilled upon the latter?\" Elizabeth inquired. \"Oh yes, madam,\"  answered Melville; \"skilled enough for a queen.\"    There the conversation stopped; but as Elizabeth was herself an  excellent musician, she commanded Lord Hunsdon to bring Melville to her  at a time when she was at her harpischord, so that he could hear her  without her seeming to have the air of playing for him. In fact, the  same day, Hunsdon, agreeably to her instructions, led the ambassador  into a gallery separated from the queen's apartment merely by tapestry,  so that his guide having raised it, Melville at his leisure could hear  Elizabeth, who did not turn round until she had finished the piece,  which, however, she was playing with much skill. When she saw Melville,  she pretended to fly into a passion, and even wanted to strike him; but  her anger calmed down by little and little at the ambassador's  compliments, and ceased altogether when he admitted that Mary Stuart was  not her equal. But this was not all: proud of her triumph, Elizabeth  desired also that Melville should see her dance. Accordingly, she kept  back her despatches for two days that he might be present at a ball that  she was giving. These despatches, as we have said, contained the wish  that Mary Stuart should espouse Leicester; but this proposal could not  be taken seriously. Leicester, whose personal worth was besides  sufficiently mediocre, was of birth too inferior to aspire to the hand  of the daughter of so many kings; thus Mary replied that such an  alliance would not become her. Meanwhile, something strange and tragic  came to pass.          CHAPTER II      Among the lords who had followed Mary Stuart to Scotland was, as we have  mentioned, a young nobleman named Chatelard, a true type of the nobility  of that time, a nephew of Bayard on his mother's side, a poet and a  knight, talented and courageous, and attached to Marshal Damville, of  whose household he formed one. Thanks to this high position, Chatelard,  throughout her stay in France, paid court to Mary Stuart, who, in the  homage he rendered her in verse, saw nothing more than those poetical  declarations of gallantry customary in that age, and with which she  especially was daily overwhelmed. But it happened that about the time  when Chatelard was most in love with the queen she was obliged to leave  France, as we have said. Then Marshal Damville, who knew nothing of  Chatelard's passion, and who himself, encouraged by Mary's kindness, was  among the candidates to succeed Francis II as husband, set out for  Scotland with the poor exile, taking Chatelard with him, and, not  imagining he would find a rival in him, he made a confidant of him, and  left him with Mary when he was obliged to leave her, charging the young  poet to support with her the interests of his suit. This post as  confidant brought Mary and Chatelard more together; and, as in her  capacity as poet, the queen treated him like a brother, he made bold in  his passion to risk all to obtain another title. Accordingly, one  evening he got into Mary Stuart's room, and hid himself under the bed;  but at the moment when the queen was beginning to undress, a little dog  she had began to yelp so loudly that her women came running at his  barking, and, led by this indication, perceived Chatelard. A woman  easily pardons a crime for which too great love is the excuse: Mary  Stuart was woman before being queen--she pardoned.    But this kindness only increased Chatelard's confidence: he put down the  reprimand he had received to the presence of the queen's women, and  supposed that if she had been alone she would have forgiven him still  more completely; so that, three weeks after, this same scene was  repeated. But this time, Chatelard, discovered in a cupboard, when the  queen was already in bed, was placed under arrest.    The moment was badly chosen: such a scandal, just when the queen was  about to re-marry, was fatal to Mary, let alone to Chatelard. Murray  took the affair in hand, and, thinking that a public trial could alone  save his sister's reputation, he urged the prosecution with such vigour,  that Chatelard, convicted of the crime of lese-majeste, was condemned to  death. Mary entreated her brother that Chatelard might be sent back to  France; but Murray made her see what terrible consequences such a use of  her right of pardon might have, so that Mary was obliged to let justice  take its course: Chatelard was led to execution. Arrived on the  scaffold, which was set up before the queen's palace, Chatelard, who had  declined the services of a priest, had Ronsard's Ode on Death read; and  when the reading, which he followed with evident pleasure, was ended, he  turned--towards the queen's windows, and, having cried out for the last  time, \"Adieu, loveliest and most cruel of princesses!\" he stretched out  his neck to the executioner, without displaying any repentance or  uttering any complaint. This death made all the more impression upon  Mary, that she did not dare to show her sympathy openly.    Meanwhile there was a rumour that the queen of Scotland was consenting  to a new marriage, and several suitors came forward, sprung from the  principal reigning families of Europe: first, the Archduke Charles,  third son of the Emperor of Germany; then the Duke of Anjou, who  afterwards became Henry III. But to wed a foreign prince was to give up  her claims to the English crown. So Mary refused, and, making a merit of  this to Elizabeth, she cast her eyes on a relation of the latter's,  Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, son of the Earl of Lennox. Elizabeth, who  had nothing plausible to urge against this marriage, since the Queen of  Scotland not only chose an Englishman for husband, but was marrying into  her own family, allowed the Earl of Lennox and his son to go to the  Scotch court, reserving it to herself, if matters appeared to take a  serious turn, to recall them both--a command which they would be  constrained to obey, since all their property was in England.    Darnley was eighteen years of age: he was handsome, well-made, elegant;  he talked in that attractive manner of the young nobles of the French  and English courts that Mary no longer heard since her exile in  Scotland; she let herself be deceived by these appearances, and did not  see that under this brilliant exterior Darnley hid utter insignificance,  dubious courage, and a fickle and churlish character. It is true that he  came to her under the auspices of a man whose influence was as striking  as the risen fortune which gave him the opportunity to exert it. We  refer to David Rizzio.    David Rizzio, who played such a great part in the life of Mary Stuart,  whose strange favour for him has given her enemies, probably without any  cause, such cruel weapons against her, was the son of a Turin musician  burdened with a numerous family, who, recognising in him a pronounced  musical taste, had him instructed in the first principles of the art. At  the age of fifteen he had left his father's house and had gone on foot  to Nice, where the Duke of Savoy held his court; there he entered the  service of the Duke of Moreto, and this lord having been appointed, some  years afterwards, to the Scottish embassy, Rizzio followed him to  Scotland. As this young man had a very fine voice, and accompanied on  the viol and fiddle songs of which both the airs and the words were of  his own composition, the ambassador spoke of him to Mary, who wished to  see him. Rizzio, full of confidence in himself, and seeing in the  queen's desire a road to success, hastened to obey her command, sang  before her, and pleased her. She begged him then of Moreto, making no  more of it than if she had asked of him a thoroughbred dog or a  well-trained falcon. Moreto presented him to her, delighted at finding  such an opportunity to pay his court; but scarcely was Rizzio in her  service than Mary discovered that music was the least of his gifts, that  he possessed, besides that, education if not profound at least varied, a  supple mind, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#4)"],[1,"been very happy at the ironworks, and very  industrious beside my kind mother. In the evening I came home on the  little chestnut. Since the day before yesterday, when he got a strain  and hurt his foot, he has been very restive and very touchy, and when he  got home he refused his food. I thought at first that he did not fancy  his fodder, and gave him some pieces of sugar and sticks of cinnamon,  which he likes very much; he tasted them, but would not eat them. The  poor little beast seems to have same other internal indisposition  besides his injured foot. If by ill luck he were to become foundered or  ill, everybody, even my parents, would throw the blame on me, and yet I  have been very careful and considerate of him. My God, my Lord, Thou who  canst do things both great and small, remove from me this misfortune,  and let him recover as quickly as possible. If, however, Thou host  willed otherwise, and if this fresh trouble is to fall upon us, I will  try to bear it with courage, and as the expiation of same sin.  Meanwhile, O my Gad, I leave this matter in Thy hands, as I leave my  life and my soul.\"    On the 20th of April he wrote:--\"The little horse is well; God has  helped me.\"    German manners and customs are so different from ours, and contrasts  occur so frequently in the same man, on the other side of the Rhine,  that anything less than all the quotations which we have given would  have been insufficient to place before our readers a true idea of that  character made up of artlessness and reason, childishness and strength,  depression and enthusiasm, material details and poetic ideas, which  renders Sand a man incomprehensible to us. We will now continue the  portrait, which still wants a few finishing touches.    When he returned to Erlangen, after the completion of his \"cure,\" Sand  read Faust far the first time. At first he was amazed at that work,  which seemed to him an orgy of genius; then, when he had entirely  finished it, he reconsidered his first impression, and wrote:--    \"4th May    \"Oh, horrible struggle of man and devil! What Mephistopheles is in me I  feel far the first time in this hour, and I feel it, O God, with  consternation!    \"About eleven at night I finished reading the tragedy, and I felt and  saw the fiend in myself, so that by midnight, amid my tears and despair,  I was at last frightened at myself.\"    Sand was falling by degrees into a deep melancholy, from which nothing  could rouse him except his desire to purify and preach morality to the  students around him. To anyone who knows university life such a task  will seem superhuman. Sand, however, was not discouraged, and if he  could not gain an influence over everyone, he at least succeeded in  forming around him a considerable circle of the most intelligent and the  best; nevertheless, in the midst of these apostolic labours strange  longings for death would overcome him; he seemed to recall heaven and  want to return to it; he called these temptations \"homesickness for the  soul's country.\"    His favourite authors were Lessing, Schiller, Herder, and Goethe; after  re-reading the two last for the twentieth time, this is what he wrote:    \"Good and evil touch each other; the woes of the young Werther and  Weisslingen's seduction, are almost the same story; no matter, we must  not judge between what is good and what is evil in others; for that is  what God will do. I have just been spending much time over this thought,  and have become convinced that in no circumstances ought we to allow  ourselves to seek for the devil in others, and that we have no right to  judge; the only creature over wham we have received the power to judge  and condemn is ourself, and that gives us enough constant care,  business, and trouble.    \"I have again to-day felt a profound desire to quit this world and enter  a higher world; but this desire is rather dejection than strength, a  lassitude than an upsoaring.\"    The year 1816 was spent by Sand in these pious attempts upon his young  comrades, in this ceaseless self-examination, and in the perpetual  battle which he waged with the desire for death that pursued him; every  day he had deeper doubts of himself; and on the 1st of January, 1817, he  wrote this prayer in his diary:--    \"Grant to me, O Lord, to me whom Thou halt endowed, in sending me on  earth, with free will, the grace that in this year which we are now  beginning I may never relax this constant attention, and not shamefully  give up the examination of my conscience which I have hitherto made.  Give me strength to increase the attention which I turn upon my own  life, and to diminish that which I turn upon the life of others;  strengthen my will that it may become powerful to command the desires of  the body and the waverings of the soul; give me a pious conscience  entirely devoted to Thy celestial kingdom, that I may always belong to  Thee, or after failing, may be able to return to Thee.\"    Sand was right in praying to God for the year 1817, and his fears were a  presentiment: the skies of Germany, lightened by Leipzig and Waterloo,  were once more darkened; to the colossal and universal despotism of  Napoleon succeeded the individual oppression of those little princes who  made up the Germanic Diet, and all that the nations had gained by  overthrowing the giant was to be governed by dwarfs. This was the time  when secret societies were organised throughout Germany; let us say a  few words about them, for the history that we are writing is not only  that of individuals, but also that of nations, and every time that  occasion presents itself we will give our little picture a wide horizon.    The secret societies of Germany, of which, without knowing them, we have  all heard, seem, when we follow them up, like rivers, to originate in  some sort of affiliation to those famous clubs of the 'illumines' and  the freemasons which made so much stir in France at the close of the  eighteenth century. At the time of the revolution of '89 these different  philosophical, political, and religious sects enthusiastically accepted  the republican doctrines, and the successes of our first generals have  often been attributed to the secret efforts of the members. When  Bonaparte, who was acquainted with these groups, and was even said to  have belonged to them, exchanged his general's uniform for an emperor's  cloak, all of them, considering him as a renegade and traitor, not only  rose against him at home, but tried to raise enemies against him abroad;  as they addressed themselves to noble and generous passions, they found  a response, and princes to whom their results might be profitable seemed  for a moment to encourage them. Among others, Prince Louis of Prussia  was grandmaster of one of these societies.    The attempted murder by Stops, to which we have already referred, was  one of the thunderclaps of the storm; but its morrow brought the peace  of Vienna, and the degradation of Austria was the death-blow of the old  Germanic organisation. These societies, which had received a mortal  wound in 1806 and were now controlled by the French police, instead of  continuing to meet in public, were forced to seek new members in the  dark. In 1811 several agents of these societies were arrested in Berlin,  but the Prussian authorities, following secret orders of Queen Louisa,  actually protected them, so that they were easily able to deceive the  French police about their intentions. About February 1815 the disasters  of the French army revived the courage of these societies, for it was  seen that God was helping their cause: the students in particular joined  enthusiastically in the new attempts that were now begun; many colleges  enrolled themselves almost entire, anal chose their principals and  professors as captains; the poet, Korner, killed on the 18th of October  at Liegzig, was the hero of this campaign.    The triumph of this national movement, which twice carried the Prussian  army--largely composed of volunteers--to Paris, was followed, when the  treaties of 1815 and the new Germanic constitution were made known, by a  terrible reaction in Germany. All these young men who, exiled by their  princes, had risen in the name of liberty, soon perceived that they had  been used as tools to establish European despotism; they wished to claim  the promises that had been made, but the policy of Talleyrand and  Metternich weighed on them, and repressing them at the first words they  uttered, compelled them to shelter their discontent and their hopes in  the universities, which, enjoying a kind of constitution of their own,  more easily escaped the investigations made by the spies of the Holy  Alliance; but, repressed as they were, these societies continued  nevertheless to exist, and kept up communications by means of travelling  students, who, bearing verbal messages, traversed Germany under the  pretence of botanising, and, passing from mountain to mountain, sowed  broadcast those luminous and hopeful words of which peoples are always  greedy and kings always fear.    We have seen that Sand, carried away by the general movement, had gone  through the campaign of 1815 as a volunteer, although he was then only  nineteen years old. On his return, he, like others, had found his golden  hopes deceived, and it is from this period that we find his journal  assuming the tone of mysticism and sadness which our readers must have  remarked in it. He soon entered one of these associations, the Teutonia;  and from that moment, regarding the great cause which he had taken up as  a religious one, he attempted to make the conspirators worthy of their  enterprise, and thus arose his attempts to inculcate moral doctrines, in  which he succeeded with some, but failed with the majority. Sand had  succeeded, however, in forming around him a certain circle of Puritans,  composed of about sixty to eighty students, all belonging to the group  of the 'Burs"]]]
