[Illustration]      He filled his pockets with sparkling stones    And took to the mighty main,    With a couple of slaves, some nuts and cones    For the glorious king of Spain.      Now this is the tale Columbus told,    And most of the tale is true,    How he crossed the seas, a sailor bold,    In fourteen-ninety-two.            [Illustration]      TERRIBLE TIM        Haven't you heard of Terrible Tim!    Well, don't you get in the way of him.    He eats lions for breakfast    And leopards for lunch,    And gobbles them down    With one terrible crunch.    He could mix a whole city    All up in a mess,    He could drink up a sea    Or an ocean, I guess.    You'd better be watching for Terrible Tim,    And run when you first get your peepers on him.            WHAT'S THE USE?        \"What's the use,\"    Said the goose,    \"To swim like a frog,    When you go just as far    If you float on a log?\"      \"Why should I,\"    Said the fly,    \"Suck an old apple-core,    When there's sugar and fruit    In the grocery store?\"      \"It's but right,\"    Said the kite,    \"That I follow the wind.    What's a fellow to do    If he hasn't a mind?\"      \"You'll allow,\"    Said the cow,    \"That I'm really no thief,    When I turn all the clover    I steal, into beef.\"      \"Come again,\"    Said the hen,    \"On some other fine day.    Don't think 'cause I cackle    I always must lay.\"            ALL ABOARD FOR BOMBAY        All aboard for Bombay,    All aboard for Rome!    Leave your little sisters    And your loving aunts at home.      Bring a bit of bailing wire,    A pocketful of nails,    And half a dozen wiener-wursts    For every man that sails.      Tell Terry Tagg, when you go by,    Be sure to bring his dog.    All aboard for Bombay    On a floating cedar log!      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      WATER        There's water in the rain barrel,    And water in the well,    There's lots of water in the pond    Where Hannah Hawkins fell.      There's water in the ocean,    And water in the skies,    And when a fellow blubbers    He gets water in his eyes.      But in the Barca desert    Where the hippodoodles play,    The water in the rivers    Just dries up and blows away.            OLD MOLLY IS LOWING        Old Molly is lowing and lowing    'Way down in the old meadow lot.    I've given her water and clover,    And all of the apples I've got;    But she won't eat a thing that I give her,    And never drinks even a sup,    For they've taken her baby to market    And some one has eaten it up.    I'd just like to go to the city    And cut them all up into halves    And feed them to sharks and to lions--    Those people that eat little calves.      [Illustration]            SNOWFLAKES        The snowflakes are falling by ones and by twos;    There's snow on my jacket, and snow on my shoes;    There's snow on the bushes, and snow on the trees--    It's snowing on everything now, if you please.      [Illustration: THE SNOWFLAKES ARE FALLING BY ONES AND BY TWOS]            DIPPY-DIPPY-DAVY        Dippy-Dippy-Davy,    Half the Royal Navy    In the dampness and the dark    Was driving off a savage shark    To Dippy-Dippy-Davy.            [Illustration]      WHEN I'M AS RICH    AS UNCLE CLAUS        When I'm as rich as Uncle Claus,    With whiskers on my chin,    I'm going to have a great big house    To put my people in.      I'll never let them wander out    Or ride with me to town;    They'll come a-running when I shout    And tremble when I frown.      I'll have some men in soldier tents,    A pirate and his mate,    And wildcats all around the fence,    And mad dogs on the gate.            RINKY-TATTLE        Rinky-tattle, rinky-tattle,    Rinky-tattle--who?    Little Tommy Taylor    Is a rinky-tattle too.      [Illustration]            TWENTY LITTLE SNOWFLAKES        Twenty little snowflakes climbing up a wire.    \"Now, listen,\" said their mother, \"don't you climb up any higher.    The sun will surely catch you, and scorch you with his fire.\"    But the naughty little snowflakes didn't mind a word she said,    Each tried to clamber faster than his fellow just ahead;    They thought that they'd be back in time enough to go to bed.    But they found out that their mother wasn't quite the dunce they          thought her,    The sun bobbed up--remember this, my little son and daughter--    And turned those twenty snowflakes into twenty drops of water.            [Illustration]      SLIPPERY SLIM        Slippery Slim, a garter snake,    Leaned against a garden rake    And smiled a sentimental smile    At Tilly Toad, on the gravel pile,    Till that bashful miss was forced to hop    And hide her face in a carrot-top.            [Illustration: THROUGH FOG AND RAIN I RUN MY TRAIN]      THE FREIGHTER        Through fog and rain    I run my train    Wherever the track is laid,    And over the road    I carry a load    Whenever the freight is paid.      A kaddy of tea    For Genessee,    For Troy an empty crate,    A man in brown    For Uniontown    To help them celebrate.            NO ONE AT HOME        No one at home in the hen-house,    And no one at home in the barn,    Old Brindle has gone to the neighbor's    To borrow a skein of brown yarn,    To borrow yarn for the darning    Of socks for her wee spotted calf--      The little rollicking rascal    Has never enough by half.    And Speckle is down by the willow    Washing her chicks in the lake,    While old Daddy Cockle is lying    Abed with a bad toothache.            PATTERS AND TATTERS        Patters had a gallant band,    An army made of clay.    But Tatters took the garden hose    And washed them all away.      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      CROWN THE KING WITH CARROT TOPS        Crown the king with carrot tops,    Dress him in sateen,    Give him lots of licorice drops,    With suckers in between.      For he's a king with lots of power    And awful, awful fierce,    He kills a pirate every hour    And washes in his tears.      He rides a charger ten feet high,    A dashing, dappled gray;    Has ginger pop and lemon pie    For breakfast every day.      So get a royal canopy,    The finest ever seen,    And whiskers for his majesty,    And tresses for the queen.            THE CANADA GOOSE        A Canada goose    On the South Palouse    Is singing her summer song.    Her words are wise,    And she greets the skies    With a voice like a steamer gong:    \"If you harbor your wealth    And keep your health,    You'll always be rich and strong.\"            [Illustration]      HIPPERTY, CLICKERTY, CLACKERTY, BANG        Hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,    Get in a corner as fast as you can!    The sideboard is tipsy, the table is mad,    The chairs have lost all the sense that they had.    So hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang,    Get in a corner as fast as you can!            [Illustration]      SONNY        A sailor gave his sonny    Nearly half a pint of money    And sent him out to buy a ton of coal;    But he met a poor old miser    Who told him it were wiser    To bury all his money in a hole.      A sailor gave his sonny    Nearly half a pint of money    And told him he should buy a suit of clothes;    But he saw a pretty maiden    With all kinds of posies laden,    And he gave her all his money for a rose.      Then the sailor gave his sonny    Nearly half a pint of money    To buy a little garden and a house;    But he found him the next day,    In a shop on Yesler Way,    A-buying cheese and crackers for a mouse.      [Illustration: HE GAVE HER ALL HIS MONEY FOR A ROSE]            THE STOVE        A stove is a thing that gets awfully hot,    And fries up your meat, or whatever you've got.    It's made out of iron and hinges and screws,    And filled up with shakers, and dampers, and flues.    It's not very long and it's not very wide;    It's got black'ning on top and ashes inside.            [Illustration]      THE THUNDER BABY        Have you heard of the Thunder Baby    Way up in the big blue sky?    You've seen his cradle, maybe,    And maybe you've heard him cry.      Most of the time he's sleeping,    Rolled up in a big white cloud,    But when he's awake and hungry    He bellows awfully loud.      And when he's crying, sometimes    You can hear his teardrops fall    With a patter, patter, patter,    Against the garden wall.      But when he's madder'n mischief,    He rolls, and growls, and spits,    And kicks the clouds all forty ways,    And gives the weather fits.      Then tears come down in bucketfuls,    And children dance for joy,    Till the sun comes out and soundly spanks    Her Thunder Baby Boy.      [Illustration]            [Illustration]      HINKY, PINKY, PEARLY EARL        Hinky, pinky, pearly earl,    Twenty nobles and a churl;    Some are fat and some are lean,    One in red and one in green--    Prior, priest, and pearly earl,    Twenty nobles and a churl.            [Illustration]      TIPSY TOM        Tipsy Tom, the naughty fellow,    Dressed his wife in pink and yellow,    Set her in an apple tree,    And said: \"Now catch a bumblebee.\"            JOLLY JINKS        Jolly Jinks, the sailor man,    Went to sea in an oyster can.    But he found the water wet,    Fishes got into his net,    So he pulled his boat to shore    And vowed he'd sail the seas no more.            TRANSFORMATION        Auntie Ellen found her poodle--    Mercy! Goodness sake!--    Playing with the mully-wumps    Down along the lake.      And when she called him tenderly    He didn't want to come;    It took her over half an hour    To get the rascal home.      She washed him well with shaving-soap,    Pumice stone and lye,    She showered him and she scoured him    And she hung him up to dry.      And now he sits there quite serene,    The sweetest poodle ever seen.      [Illustration: TRANSFORMATION]            [Illustration]      THE THIEF CHASE        Bricks and bones!
