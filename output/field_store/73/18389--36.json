The  room was full of shouting and running and sword-clashing; for in the  dark and the noise the men could not tell their own soldiers. More than  one fell by his friend's sword. When it was less crowded about the  doorway, I whispered:    \"'Follow me in double line. We will make for the ships. Keep close  together.'    \"So that double line of men, with swords swinging from both sides, ran  out through the dark. Swords struck out at us, and we struck back. Men  ran after us shouting, but our legs were as good as theirs. But I and  Hakon and one other were all that reached the ship. There we saw our  'Waverunner' with sail up and bow pointing to open sea. We swam out to  her and climbed aboard. Then the men swung the sail to the wind, and we  moved off. Even as we went, a spear whizzed through the air, and Hakon  fell dead; for the king and all his men were running to the shore.    \"'After them!' they were shouting.    \"Then we heard the king call to the men in his boats lying out in the  water:    \"'Row to shore and take us in.'    \"Thorkel was standing by my side. At that he laughed and said:    \"'They do not answer. He left but a handful to guard his ships. They  tasted our swords. And we went aboard and broke the oars and threw the  sails into the water. It will be slow going for Havard to-night.'    [Illustration: \"_Then he turned to the shore and sang out loudly_\"]    \"Then he turned to the shore and sang out loudly:        \"'King Havard's ships are dead:      Olaf's dragon flies.      King Havard stamps the shore:      Olaf skims the waves.      King Havard shakes his fist.      Olaf turns and laughs.'    \"That was the end of our meeting with King Havard.\"    [Decoration]      FOOTNOTES:    [5] See note about beds on page 196.          [Illustration]    Foes'-fear      Every day the boy Harald heard some such story of war or of the gods,  until he could see Thor riding among the storm-clouds and throwing his  hammer, until he knew that a brave man has many wounds, but never a one  on his back. Many nights he dreamed that he himself walked into  Valhalla, and that all the heroes stood up and shouted:    \"Welcome! Harald Halfdanson!\"    \"Ah! the bite of the sword is sweeter than the kiss of your mother,\" he  said to Olaf one day. \"When shall I stand in the prow of a dragon and  feast on the fight? I am hungry to see the world. Ivar the Far-goer  tells me of the strange countries he has seen. Ah! we vikings are great  folk. There is no water that has not licked our boats' sides. This cape  of mine came in a viking boat from France. These cloak-pins came from a  far country called Greece. In my father's house are golden cups from  Rome, away on the southern sea. Every land pours rich things into our  treasure-chest. Ivar has been to a strange country where it is all sand  and is very hot. The people call their country Arabia. They have never  heard of Thor or Odin. Ivar brought beautiful striped cloth from there,  and wonderful, sweet-smelling waters. Oh! when shall the white horses of  the sea lead me out to strange lands and glorious battles?\"    But Harald did something besides listen to stories. Every morning he was  up at sunrise and went with a thrall to feed the hunting dogs. Thorstein  taught him to swim in the rough waters of the fiord. Often he went with  the men a-hunting in the woods and learned to ride a horse and pull a  bow and throw a lance. Ivar taught him to play the harp and to make up  songs. He went much to the smithy, where the warriors mended their  helmets and made their spears and swords of iron and bronze. At first he  only watched the men or worked the bellows, but soon he could handle the  tongs and hold the red-hot iron, and after a long time he learned to  use the hammer and to shape metal. One day he made himself a spear-head.  It was two feet long and sharp on both edges. While the iron was hot he  beat into it some runes. When the men in the smithy saw the runes they  opened their eyes wide and looked at the boy, for few Norsemen could  read.    \"What does it say?\" they asked.    \"It is the name of my spear-point, and it says, 'Foes'-fear,'\" Harald  said. \"But now for a handle.\"    It was winter and the snow was very deep. So Harald put on his skees and  started for a wood that was back from shore. Down the mountains he went,  twenty, thirty feet at a slide, leaping over chasms a hundred feet  across. In his scarlet cloak he looked like a flash of fire. The wind  shot past him howling. His eyes danced at the fun.    \"It is like flying,\" he thought and laughed. \"I am an eagle. Now I  soar,\" as he leaped over a frozen river.    He saw a slender ash growing on top of a high rock.    \"That is the handle for 'Foes'-fear,'\" he said.    The rock stood up like a ragged tower, but he did not stop because of  the steep climb. He threw off his skees and thrust his hands and feet  into holes of the rock and drew himself up. He tore his jacket and cut  his leather leggings and scratched his face and bruised his hands, but  at last he was on the top. Soon he had chopped down the tree and had cut  a straight pole ten feet long and as big around as his arm. He went  down, sliding and jumping and tearing himself on the sharp stones. With  a last leap he landed near his skees. As he did so a lean wolf jumped  and snapped at him, snarling. Harald shouted and swung his pole. The  wolf dodged, but quickly jumped again and caught the boy's arm between  his sharp teeth. Harald thought of the spear-point in his belt. In a  wink he had it out and was striking with it. He drove it into the wolf's  neck and threw him back on the snow, dead.    \"You are the first to feel the tooth of 'Foes'-fear,'\" he said, \"but I  think you will not be the last.\"    [Illustration: \"_He drove it into the wolf's neck_\"]    Then without thinking of his torn arm he put on his skees and went  leaping home. He went straight to the smithy and smoothed his pole and  drove it into the haft of the spear-point. He hammered out a gold band  and put it around the joining place. He made nails with beautiful heads  and drove them into the pole in different places.    \"If it is heavy it will strike hard,\" he said.    Then he weighed the spear in his hand and found the balancing point and  put another gold band there to mark it.    Thorstein came in while he was working.    \"A good spear,\" he said.    Then he saw the torn sleeve and the red wound beneath.    \"Hello!\" he cried. \"Your first wound?\"    \"Oh, it is only a wolf-scratch,\" Harald answered.    \"By Thor!\" cried Thorstein, \"I see that you are ready for better wounds.  You bear this like a warrior.\"    \"I think it will not be my last,\" Harald said.          [Illustration]    Harald is King      Now when Harald was ten years old his father, King Halfdan, died. An old  book that tells about Harald says that then \"he was the biggest of all  men, the strongest, and the fairest to look upon.\" That about a boy ten  years old! But boys grew fast in those days for they were out of doors  all the time, running, swimming, leaping on skees, and hunting in the  forest. All that makes big, manly boys.    So now King Halfdan was dead and buried, and Harald was to be king. But  first he must drink his father's funeral ale.    \"Take down the gay tapestries that hang in the feast hall,\" he said to  the thralls. \"Put up black and gray ones. Strew the floor with pine  branches. Brew twenty tubs of fresh ale and mead. Scour every dish until  it shines.\"    Then Harald sent messengers all over that country to his kinsmen and  friends.    \"Bid them come in three months' time to drink my father's funeral ale,\"  he said. \"Tell them that no one shall go away empty-handed.\"    So in three months men came riding up at every hour. Some came in boats.  But many had ridden far through mountains, swimming rivers; for there  were few roads or bridges in Norway. On account of that hard ride no  women came to the feast.    At nine o'clock in the night the feast began. The men came walking in at  the west end of the hall.[6] The great bonfires down the middle of the  room were flashing light on everything. The clean smell of this  wood-smoke and of the pine branches on the floor was pleasant to the  guests. Down each side of the hall stretched long, backless benches,  with room for three hundred men. In the middle of each side rose the  high seat, a great carved chair on a platform. All along behind the  benches were the black and gray draperies. Here hung the shields of the  guests; for every man, when he was given his place, turned and hung his  shield behind him and set his tall spear by it. So on each wall there  was a long row of gay shields, red and green and yellow, and all shining  with gold or bronze trimmings. And higher up there was another row of  gleaming spear-points. Above the hall the rafters were carved and gaily  painted, so that dragons seemed to be crawling across, or eagles seemed  to be swooping down.    The guests walked in laughing and talking with their big voices so that  the rafters rang. They made the hall look all the brighter with their  clothes of scarlet and blue and green, with their flashing golden  bracelets and head-bands and sword-scabbards, with their flying hair of  red or yellow.    Across the east end of the hall was a bench. When the men were all in,  the queen, Harald's mother, and the women who lived with her, walked in  through the east door and sat upon this bench.    Then thralls came running in and set up the long tables[7] before the  benches. Other thralls ran in with large steaming kettles of meat. They  put big pieces of this meat into platters of wood and set it before the  men. They had a few dishes of silver. These they put before the guests  at the middle of the tables; for the great people sat here near the high  seats.    When the meat came, the talking stopped; for Norsemen ate only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#4)"],[1,"away, but it felt that it was driven to bay, and began  to show fight in the most vicious fashion, snapping its flat beak,  hissing, snorting, rattling its plumage, and undulating its long neck,  as it danced about, till it looked like a boa constrictor which had  partially developed into a bird.    Then it dashed at its pursuer, snapping at him in its rushes.  But the  bill was not the thing to mind; a few lashes with the whip were enough  to ward off its attack.  The danger to be avoided came from those  tremendous legs, which could deliver kicks hard enough to break a man's  bones.    Three times over did the great bird strike at Dyke, as it was driven  down to the pen with lash after lash of the whip, which wrapped round  the neck, as the head rose fully eight feet above the ground.  Then came  another stroke which took effect, not upon Dyke's leg, but upon the  horse's flank, just behind the stirrup, in spite of the clever little  animal's bounds to avoid the kicks.    What followed was instantaneous.  The horse whirled round, snorting with  pain, and struck out at his enemy, sending out its heels with such  violence and effect, that they came in contact with one of the ostrich's  shanks, and the next moment the giant bird came to the ground, a heap of  feathers, from which the long neck kept darting, and one leg delivering  heavy blows.        CHAPTER FOUR.    ANOTHER FAILURE?    \"Why, Dyke, boy, you've done it now,\" cried Joe Emson, cantering close  up, his horse snorting as the ostrich struck at him with its snake-like  head.    \"Yes, you had better have left me where I was by the spring,\" said the  boy disconsolately.  \"I hated the old wretch, but I didn't want to hurt  him.\"    \"I know, my lad, I know,\" said Emson.  \"I'm not blaming you, but it does  seem a pity.  What bad luck I do have with these birds, to be sure.--Lie  still, you savage; you can't get up!\"    This to the bird, which, after striking at him two or three times, made  a desperate effort to rise, fluttering and beating with its wings, and  hopping a little, but trailing its broken leg as it made for the pen,  within which were all its friends.    \"Yes, you had better have stayed at home, old fellow,\" said Dyke,  apostrophising the unhappy bird; \"then you wouldn't have got into this  state.--I say, Joe, couldn't we set its leg?  It would soon grow  together again.\"    \"If he were one of the quiet old hens, I'd say yes; but it would be  impossible.  Directly we went near, there would be a kick or a peck.\"    \"I'll try,\" said Dyke; and going gently toward where the bird lay  crouched in a heap, he spoke softly to it, as he had been accustomed to  speak to the others when going to feed them.  But his advance was the  signal for the bird to draw back its head, its eyes flashing angrily,  while it emitted a fierce roaring sound that was like that of some  savage, cat-like beast.  It struck out with beak and wings, and made  desperate efforts to rise.    \"Stop!\" cried Emson sharply.    \"I'm not afraid,\" cried Dyke.  \"I'll get hold of his neck, and try and  hold him.\"    \"I know,\" said his brother; \"but the poor creature will knock itself to  pieces.\"    \"But so it will if you leave it quiet,\" cried Dyke; and then, sharply:  \"Ah! you cowardly brutes, let him alone.\"    This was to some half-a-dozen cock birds in the pen, which, possibly in  remembrance of the many times they had been thrashed and driven about  the pen by their injured king, seized the opportunity of his downfall to  thrust out their long necks and begin striking at him savagely, seizing  him by the feathers, and dragging them out, till he shuffled beyond  their reach.    \"His fate's sealed if he is put with the rest; that's very evident,\"  said Emson.    \"Killum!\" said the Kaffir, nodding his head.    \"Let's shut him up in the stable,\" said Dyke, \"and tie him down while we  set his leg.\"    \"It would mean such a desperate struggle that the poor bird would never  get over it; and if it did, it would mope and die.  Better put it out of  its misery.\"    Just then a big rough dog came out of the house, where it had been  having a long sleep through the hot part of the day, and after giving  Dyke a friendly wag of the tail, walked slowly toward the injured  ostrich.    That was enough to make the bird draw back its head and strike at the  dog, which avoided the blow, and growling fiercely, prepared to resent  the attack.    \"Come away, Duke,\" cried Dyke.  \"To heel, sir.\"    The dog growled and seemed to protest, but went obediently behind his  younger master.    \"I had better shoot the bird, Dyke,\" said Emson.    \"No, no; don't.  Let's have a try to save it.  Perhaps when it finds  that we want to do it good, it will lie quiet.\"    \"No,\" said Emson; \"it will take it as meant for war.\"    \"Well, let's try,\" said Dyke.--\"Here, Breezy: stable.\"    The cob walked slowly away toward its shed, and the other horse  followed, while Dyke hurriedly fetched a couple of pieces of rope,  formed of twisted antelope skin.    \"What do you propose doing?\" said Emson.    \"All run in together, and tie his neck to one wing; then he'll be  helpless, and we can tie his thighs together.  You can set the leg  then.\"    \"Well, I'll try,\" said Emson.  \"Wait till I've cut a couple of pieces of  wood for splints.  What can I get?\"    \"Bit of box-lid,\" replied Dyke; and in a few minutes Emson returned,  bearing in addition a flat roll of stout webbing, such as is used by  upholsterers, and by the poor emigrants to lace together across a frame,  and form the beds upon which they stretch their weary bones at night.    \"I think I can set it, and secure it,\" said Emson.    \"Why, of course you can.\"    \"Yes, but as soon as it's done, the poor brute will kick it off.  Now  then, how about tying him?\"    \"Rush him,\" said Dyke laconically.  \"Come along, Jack, and help.\"    But the Kaffir shook his head rapidly.    \"Why, hullo!  You won't back out, Jack?\"    \"No.  Him kick, bite: no good.\"    \"Never you mind that,\" cried Dyke.  \"You rush in with us, and hold his  head, while we take his legs and wings.  Do you understand?\"    \"No,\" said the Kaffir, shaking his head.  \"Killum--killum!\" and he made  a gesture as if striking with a club.    \"Not going to kill,\" cried Dyke.  \"You rush in and hold the head.  Do  you understand?\"    \"No,\" said the Kaffir.    \"He won't,\" cried Emson.  \"We shall have to do it ourselves, Dyke.  Make  a noose and lasso the brute's head.  Then when I run in to seize the  leg, you drag the neck tight down to the wing, and hold it there.\"    Dyke nodded, made a noose at the end of his hide rope, and advanced  gently toward the ostrich, which struck at him, but only to dart its  head through the loop; and this was drawn tight.    \"Now, Joe, ready?\" cried the boy, as the dog set up a furious barking,  and joined in the rush that was made by the brothers, who succeeded in  pinning down the bird.  Emson holding the legs, while avoiding a buffet  from the uppermost wing, Dyke slipped the rope round the bone, dragged  down the head, and after a furious struggle, the bird lay still.    \"Think you can manage now?\" panted Dyke, who was hot from exertion.    \"Yes; I'll tie his legs together, after setting the broken one.  It's  the only chance for him.\"    \"Yes; it's all right,\" cried Dyke; \"he's getting weaker, and giving in.\"    \"Seems like it,\" said his brother sarcastically, for as the boy spoke,  the great bird began to beat with its wings with terrific violence,  keeping it up for fully five minutes, and giving the pair a hard task to  hold it down, while the Kaffir looked on calmly enough, and the dog kept  on charging in, as if eager to seize one of the legs, and hold it still.    \"Well, there then, he is giving in now,\" panted Dyke, who had been  compelled to put forth all his strength to keep from being thrown off by  the violent buffeting of the bird's wings.  \"Look sharp, and get it  done.\"    Dyke got one hand at liberty now to wipe the feather-down from his face,  where the perspiration made it adhere, and as he looked up, he could not  refrain from laughing aloud at the row of comical flat heads peering  over the wire fence, where the ostriches in the pen were gathered  together to look on.    \"Yes,\" said Emson gravely; \"he is giving in now, poor brute.  He'll  never hunt the young cocks round the enclosure again.\"    \"And they know it, too,\" cried Dyke.  \"Look at them wagging their silly  old heads and trying to look cunning.--But hullo why don't you go on?\"    \"Can't you see?\" said Emson.  \"The horse's hoofs must have struck him in  the side as well.  The poor old goblin is dead.\"    Dyke leaped to his feet in dismay, and stared sceptically from his  brother to the bird, and back again and again.    It was true enough: the great bird, which so short a time ago was  seeming to spin with such wonderful speed across the veldt that its legs  were nearly invisible, now lay on its side, with the stilt-like members  perfectly still, one being stretched out to its full length, the other  in a peculiar double angle, through the broken bone making a fresh  joint.    \"Oh, the poor old goblin!\" said the boy, hurriedly unloosening the rein  which held down its head.  \"I didn't choke it, did I?  No: look, the  loop was quite big.\"    \"No; the ribs are crushed in,\" said Emson, feeling beneath the beautiful  plumage.  \"Another loss, Dyke.  We shall find out all his good qualities  now.\"    \"Breezy kick and killum,\" said the Kaffir sententiously.  \"Bird kick,  horse kick; killum--shouldn't kick.\"    \"Here, you go back to your kraal, and set up for a wise man of the  south,\" cried Dyke pettishly.  \"How long did it take you to find out all  that?\"  \"Yes, killum dead,\" said the Kaffir, nodding.  \"Bosh!\" cried  Dyke, turning impatiently away.  \"Well, we must make the best of it,\"  said Emson then.  \"His feathers will be worth something, for they are in  fine condition.  Let's get them off at once.\"    The"]]]
