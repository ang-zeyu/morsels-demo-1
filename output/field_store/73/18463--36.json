The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout the  entry:    Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish  and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid  rain).    Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly  to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH  scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered  alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note  - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in  New England.    Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke,  or fog.    Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting  trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that  have been cut or destroyed by fire.    Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in  fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in  particulate form.    Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.    Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance,  and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.    Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area  or volume.    Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in  various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean,  terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.    Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited  freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.    DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was  banned in the US in 1972.    Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.    Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,  and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without  planting new growth.    Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-  arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive  soils, or climate change.    Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,  shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.    Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally  anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an  over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine  species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping the ocean clean\".    Ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of  organisms and their specific environments.    Effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste  which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.    Endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.    Freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.    Greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the lower  atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary  greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.    Groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often  in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source  for wells and natural springs.    Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly  and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it  forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders  economic resources.    Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 145,000 Inuits of  Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental  issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the  focus of the ICC; the most current"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2752"],[0,"Martin Guerre (#4)"],[1,"grief: I now repent what I did. But I was  young, I was proud, and your reproaches were unjust.\"    \"Ah,\" said she, \"you have not forgotten the cause of our quarrel?\"    \"It was little Rose, our neighbour, whom you said I was making love to,  because you found us together at the spring in the little wood. I  explained that we met only by chance,--besides, she was only a  child,--but you would not listen, and in your anger--\"    \"Ah! forgive me, Martin, forgive me!\" she interrupted, in confusion.    \"In your blind anger you took up, I know not what, something which lay  handy, and flung it at me. And here is the mark,\" he continued, smiling,  \"this scar, which is still to be seen.\"    \"Oh, Martin!\" Bertrande exclaimed, \"can you ever forgive me?\"    \"As you see,\" Martin replied, kissing her tenderly.    Much moved, Bertrande swept aside his hair, and looked at the scar  visible on his forehead.    \"But,\" she said, with surprise not free from alarm, \"this scar seems to  me like a fresh one.\"    \"Ah!\" Martin explained, with a, little embarrassment; \"it reopened  lately. But I had thought no more about it. Let us forget it, Bertrande;  I should not like a recollection which might make you think yourself  less dear to me than you once were.\"    And he drew her upon his knee. She repelled him gently.    \"Send the child to bed,\" said Martin. \"Tomorrow shall be for him;  to-night you have the first place, Bertrande, you only.\"    The boy kissed his father and went.    Bertrande came and knelt beside her husband, regarding him attentively  with an uneasy smile, which did not appear to please him by any means.    \"What is the matter?\" said he. \"Why do you examine me thus?\"    \"I do not know--forgive me, oh! forgive me! . . . But the happiness of  seeing you was so great and unexpected, it is all like a dream. I must  try to become accustomed to it; give me some time to collect myself; let  me spend this night in prayer. I ought to offer my joy and my  thanksgiving to Almighty God--\"    \"Not so,\" interrupted her husband, passing his arms round her neck and  stroking her beautiful hair. \"No; 'tis to me that your first thoughts  are due. After so much weariness, my rest is in again beholding you, and  my happiness after so many trials will be found in your love. That hope  has supported me throughout, and I long to be assured that it is no  illusion.\" So saying, he endeavoured to raise her.    \"Oh,\" she murmured, \"I pray you leave me.\"    \"What!\" he exclaimed angrily. \"Bertrande, is this your love? Is it thus  you keep faith with me? You will make me doubt the evidence of your  friends; you will make me think that indifference, or even another  love----\"    \"You insult me,\" said Bertrande, rising to her feet.    He caught her in his arms. \"No, no; I think nothing which could wound  you, my queen, and I believe your fidelity, even as before, you know, on  that first journey, when you wrote me these loving letters which I have  treasured ever since. Here they are.\" And he drew forth some papers, on  which Bertrande recognised her own handwriting. \"Yes,\" he continued, \"I  have read and--re-read them.... See, you spoke then of your love and the  sorrows of absence. But why all this trouble and terror? You tremble,  just as you did when I first received you from your father's hands....  It was here, in this very room.... You begged me then to leave you, to  let you spend the night in prayer; but I insisted, do you remember? and  pressed you to my heart, as I do now.\"    \"Oh,\" she murmured weakly, \"have pity!\"    But the words were intercepted by a kiss, and the remembrance of the  past, the happiness of the present, resumed their sway; the imaginary  terrors were forgotten, and the curtains closed around the marriage-bed.    The next day was a festival in the village of Artigues. Martin returned  the visits of all who had come to welcome him the previous night, and  there were endless recognitions and embracings. The young men remembered  that he had played with them when they were little; the old men, that  they had been at his wedding when he was only twelve.    The women remembered having envied Bertrande, especially the pretty  Rose, daughter of Marcel, the apothecary, she who had roused the demon  of jealousy in, the poor wife's heart. And Rose knew quite well that the  jealousy was not without some cause; for Martin had indeed shown her  attention, and she was unable to see him again without emotion. She was  now the wife of a rich peasant, ugly, old, and jealous, and she  compared, sighing, her unhappy lot with that of her more fortunate  neighbour. Martin's sisters detained him amongst them, and spoke of  their childish games and of their parents, both dead in Biscay. Martin  dried the tears which flowed at these recollections of the past, and  turned their thoughts to rejoicing. Banquets were given and received.  Martin invited all his relations and former friends; an easy gaiety  prevailed. It was remarked that the hero of the feast refrained from  wine; he was thereupon reproached, but answered that on account of the  wounds he had received he was obliged to avoid excess. The excuse was  admitted, the result of Martin's precautions being that he kept a clear  head on his shoulders, while all the rest had their tongues loosed by  drunkenness.    \"Ah!\" exclaimed one of the guests, who had studied a little medicine,  \"Martin is quite right to be afraid of drink. Wounds which have  thoroughly healed may be reopened and inflamed by intemperance, and wine  in the case of recent wounds is deadly poison. Men have died on the  field of battle in an hour or two merely because they had swallowed a  little brandy.\"    Martin Guerre grew pale, and began a conversation with the pretty Rose,  his neighbour. Bertrande observed this, but without uneasiness; she had  suffered too much from her former suspicions, besides her husband showed  her so much affection that she was now quite happy.    When the first few days were over, Martin began to look into his  affairs. His property had suffered by his long absence, and he was  obliged to go to Biscay to claim his little estate there, the law having  already laid hands upon it. It was several months before, by dint of  making judicious sacrifices, he could regain possession of the house and  fields which had belonged to his father. This at last accomplished, he  returned to Artigues, in order to resume the management of his wife's  property, and with this end in view, about eleven months after his  return, he paid a visit to his uncle Pierre.    Pierre was expecting him; he was extremely polite, desired Martin, to  sit down, overwhelmed him with compliments, knitting his brows as he  discovered that his nephew decidedly meant business. Martin broke  silence.    \"Uncle,\" he said, \"I come to thank you for the care you have taken of my  wife's property; she could never have managed it alone. You have  received the income in the family interest: as a good guardian, I  expected no less from your affection. But now that I have returned, and  am free from other cares, we will go over the accounts, if you please.\"    His uncle coughed and cleared his voice before replying, then said  slowly, as if counting his words--    \"It is all accounted for, my dear nephew; Heaven be praised! I don't owe  you anything.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed the astonished Martin, \"but the whole income?\"    \"Was well and properly employed in the maintenance of your wife and  child.\"    \"What! a thousand livres for that? And Bertrande lived alone, so quietly  and simply! Nonsense! it is impossible.\"    \"Any surplus,\" resumed the old man, quite unmoved,--\"any surplus went to  pay the expenses of seed-time and harvest.\"    \"What! at a time when labour costs next to nothing?\"    \"Here is the account,\" said Pierre.    \"Then the account is a false one,\" returned his nephew.    Pierre thought it advisable to appear extremely offended and angry, and  Martin, exasperated at his evident dishonesty, took still higher ground,  and threatened to bring an action against him. Pierre ordered him to  leave the house, and suiting actions to words, took hold of his arm to  enforce his departure. Martin, furious, turned and raised his fist to  strike.    \"What! strike your uncle, wretched boy!\" exclaimed the old man.    Martin's hand dropped, but he left the house uttering reproaches and  insults, among which Pierre distinguished--    \"Cheat that you are!\"    \"That is a word I shall remember,\" cried the angry old man, slamming his  door violently.    Martin brought an action before the judge at Rieux, and in course of  time obtained a decree, which, reviewing the accounts presented by  Pierre, disallowed them, and condemned the dishonest guardian to pay his  nephew four hundred livres for each year of his administration. The day  on which this sum had to be disbursed from his strong box the old usurer  vowed vengeance, but until he could gratify his hatred he was forced to  conceal it, and to receive attempts at reconciliation with a friendly  smile. It was not until six months later, on the occasion of a joyous  festivity, that Martin again set foot in his uncle's house. The bells  were ringing for the birth of a child, there was great gaiety at  Bertrande's house, where all the guests were waiting on the threshold  for the godfather in order to take the infant to church, and when Martin  appeared, escorting his uncle, who was adorned with a huge bouquet for  the occasion, and who now came forward and took the hand of Rose, the  pretty godmother, there were cries of joy on all sides. Bertrande was  delighted at this reconciliation, and dreamed only of happiness. She was  so happy now, her long sorrow was atoned for, her regret was at an end,  her prayers seemed to have been heard, the long interval between the  former delights and the present seemed wiped out as if the bond of union  had never been broken, and if she remembered her grief"]]]
