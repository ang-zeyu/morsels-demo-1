STRACHEY (Written, 1611-12).    But their chief god they worship is no other, indeed, then the divell,  whome they make presentments of, and shadow under the forme of an idoll,  which they entitle Okeus, and whome they worship as the Romans did their  hurtful god Vejovis, more for feare of harme then for hope of any good;  they saie they have conference with him, and fashion themselves in  their disguisments as neere to his shape as they can imagyn. In every  territory of a weroance is a temple and a priest, peradventure two or  thrie; yet happie doth that weroance accompt himself who can detayne  with him a Quiyough-quisock, of the best, grave, lucky, well instructed  in their misteryes, and beloved of their god; and such a one is noe  lesse honoured then was Dianae's priest at Ephesus, for whome they  have their more private temples, with oratories and chauneells therein,  according as is the dignity and reverence of the Quiyough-quisock, which  the weroance wilbe at charge to build upon purpose, sometyme twenty  foote broad and a hundred in length, fashioned arbour wyse after their  buylding, having comonly the dore opening into the east, and at the  west end a spence or chauncell from the body of the temple, with hollow  wyndings and pillers, whereon stand divers black imagies, fashioned  to the shoulders, with their faces looking down the church, and where  within their weroances, upon a kind of biere of reedes, lye buryed;  and under them, apart, in a vault low in the ground (as a more secrett  thing), vailed with a matt, sitts their Okeus, an image ill-favouredly  carved, all black dressed, with chaynes of perle, the presentment and  figure of that god (say the priests unto the laity, and who religiously  believe what the priests saie) which doth them all the harme they  suffer, be yt in their bodies or goods, within doores or abroad; and  true yt is many of them are divers tymes (especyally offendors) shrewdly  scratched as they walke alone in the woods, yt may well be by the  subtyle spirit, the malitious enemy to mankind, whome, therefore, to  pacefie and worke to doe them good (at least no harme) the priests tell  them they must do these and these sacrifices unto (them) of these and  these things, and thus and thus often, by which meanes not only their  owne children, but straungers, are sometimes sacrificed unto him: whilst  the great god (the priests tell them) who governes all the world, and  makes the sun to shine, creating the moone and stars his companyons,  great powers, and which dwell with him, and by whose virtues and  influences the under earth is tempered, and brings forth her fruiets  according to her seasons, they calling Ahone; the good and peaceable god  requires no such dutyes, nor needes be sacrificed unto, for he intendeth  all good unto them, and will doe noe harme, only the displeased Okeus,  looking into all men's accions, and examining the same according to the  severe scale of justice, punisheth them with sicknesse, beats them, and  strikes their ripe corn with blastings, stormes, and thunder clapps,  stirrs up warre, and makes their women falce unto them. Such is the  misery and thraldome under which Sathan hath bound these wretched  miscreants.      I began by calling Strachey a plagiary. The reader will now observe that  he gives far more than he takes. For example, his account of the temples  is much more full than that of Smith, and he adds to Smith's version the  character and being of Ahone, as what \"the priests tell them\". I submit,  therefore, that Strachey's additions, if valid for temples, are not  discredited for Ahone, merely because they are inserted in the framework  of Smith. As far as I understand the matter, Smith's Map of Virginia  (1612) is an amended copy, with additions, by Smith or another writer  of that description, which he sent home to the Council of Virginia,  in November, 1608.(1) To the book of 1612 was added a portion of  \"Relations\" by different hands, edited by W. S., namely, Dr. Symonds.  Strachey's editor, in 1849, regarded W. S. as Strachey, and supposed  that Strachey was the real author of Smith's Map of Virginia, so that,  in his Historie of Travaile, Strachey merely took back his own. He did  not take back his own; he made use of Smith's MS., not yet published, if  Mr. Arber and I rightly date Strachey's MS. at 1610-15, or 1611-12.  Why Strachey acted thus it is possible to conjecture. As a scholar well  acquainted with Virginia, and as Secretary for the Colony, he would have  access to Smith's MS. of 1608 among the papers of the Council, before  its publication. Smith professes himself \"no scholer\".(2) On the other  hand, Strachey likes to show off his Latin and Greek. He has a  curious, if inaccurate, knowledge of esoteric Greek and Roman religious  antiquities, and in writing of religion aims at a comparative method.  Strachey, however, took the trouble to copy bits of Smith into his own  larger work, which he never gave to the printers.      (1) Arber, p. 444.    (2) Arber, p. 442.      Now as to Ahone. It suits my argument to suppose that Strachey's account  is no less genuine than his description of the temples (illustrated by  a picture by John White, who had been in Virginia in 1589), and the  account of the Great Hare of American mythology.(1) This view of a  Virginian Creator, \"our chief god\" \"who takes upon him this shape of a  hare,\" was got, says Strachey, \"last year, 1610,\" from a brother of the  Potomac King, by a boy named Spilman, who says that Smith \"sold\" him  to Powhattan.(2) In his own brief narrative Spelman (or Spilman) says  nothing about the Cosmogonic Legend of the Great Hare. The story came  up when Captain Argoll was telling Powhattan's brother the account of  creation in Genesis (1610).      (1) Strachey, p. 98-100.    (2) \"Spilman's Narrative,\" Arber, cx.-cxiv.      Now Strachey's Great Hare is accepted by mythologists, while Ahone is  regarded with suspicion. Ahone does not happen to suit anthropological  ideas, the Hare suits them rather better. Moreover, and more important,  there is abundant corroborative evidence for Oke and for the Hare,  Michabo, who, says Dr. Brinton, \"was originally the highest divinity  recognised by them, powerful and beneficent beyond all others, maker of  the heavens and the world,\" just like Ahone, in fact. And Dr. Brinton  instructs us that Michabo originally meant not Great Hare, but \"the  spirit of light\".(1) Thus, originally, the Red Men adored \"The Spirit of  Light, maker of the heavens and the world\". Strachey claims no more than  this for Ahone. Now, of course, Dr. Brinton may be right. But I have  already expressed my extreme distrust of the philological processes  by which he extracts \"The Great Light; spirit of light,\" from Michabo,  \"beyond a doubt!\" In my poor opinion, whatever claims Michabo may have  as an unique creator of earth and heaven--\"God is Light,\"--he owes his  mythical aspect as a Hare to something other than an unconscious pun. In  any case, according to Dr. Brinton, Michabo, regarded as a creator, is  equivalent to Strachey's Ahone. This amount of corroboration, valeat  quantum, I may claim, from the Potomac Indians, for the belief in  Ahone on the James River. Dr. Brinton is notoriously not a believer in  American \"monotheism\".(2)      (1) Myths of the New World, p. 178.    (2) Myths of the New World, p. 53.      The opponents of the authenticity of Ahone, however, will certainly  argue: \"For Oke, or Oki, as a redoubted being or spirit, or general name  for such personages, we have plentiful evidence, corroborating that of  Smith. But what evidence as to Ahone corroborates that of Strachey?\" I  must confess that I have no explicit corroborative evidence for Ahone,  but then I have no accessible library of early books on Virginia. Now  it is clear that if I found and produced evidence for Ahone as late  as 1625, I would be met at once with the retort that, between 1610 and  1625, Christian ideas had contaminated the native beliefs. Thus if I  find Ahone, or a deity of like attributes, after a very early date, he  is of no use for my purpose. Nor do I much expect to find him. But do we  find Winslow's Massachusetts God, Kiehtan, named AFTER 1622 (\"I only  ask for information\"), and if we don't, does that prevent Mr. Tylor from  citing Kiehtan, with apparent reliance on the evidence?(1)      (1) Primitive Culture, ii. p. 342.      Again, Ahone, though primal and creative, is, by Strachey's account,  a sleeping partner. He has no sacrifice, and no temple or idol is  recorded. Therefore the belief in Ahone could only be discovered as a  result of inquiry, whereas figures of Oke or Okeus, and his services,  were common and conspicuous.(1) As to Oke, I cannot quite understand Mr.  Tylor's attitude. Summarising Lafitau, a late writer of 1724, Mr. Tylor  writes: \"The whole class of spirits or demons, known to the Caribs by  the name of cemi, in Algonkin as manitu, in Huron as oki, Lafitau now  spells with capital letters, and converts them each into a supreme  being\".(2) Yet in Primitive Culture, ii., 342, 1891, Mr. Tylor had  cited Smith's Okee (with a capital letter) as the \"chief god\" of the  Virginians in 1612. How can Lafitau be said to have elevated oki into  Oki, and so to have made a god out of \"a class of spirits or demons,\"  in 1724, when Mr. Tylor had already cited Smith's Okee, with a capital  letter and as a \"chief god,\" in 1612? Smith, rebuked for the same by Mr.  Tylor, had even identified Okee with the devil. Lafitau certainly  did not begin this erroneous view of Oki as a \"chief god\" among the  Virginians. If I cannot to-day produce corroboration for a god named  Ahone, I can at least show that, from the north of New England to the  south of Virginia, there is early evidence, cited by Mr. Tylor, for a  belief in a primal creative being, closely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,".  The artist may of course, in wanton moods, dream of some Paradise (for  art) where the direct appeal to the intelligence might be legalised; for  to such extravagances as these his yearning mind can scarce hope ever  completely to close itself. The most he can do is to remember they ARE  extravagances.    All of which is perhaps but a gracefully devious way of saying that  Henrietta Stackpole was a good example, in \"The Portrait,\" of the truth  to which I just adverted--as good an example as I could name were it not  that Maria Gostrey, in \"The Ambassadors,\" then in the bosom of time,  may be mentioned as a better. Each of these persons is but wheels to the  coach; neither belongs to the body of that vehicle, or is for a moment  accommodated with a seat inside. There the subject alone is ensconced,  in the form of its \"hero and heroine,\" and of the privileged high  officials, say, who ride with the king and queen. There are reasons  why one would have liked this to be felt, as in general one would like  almost anything to be felt, in one's work, that one has one's self  contributively felt. We have seen, however, how idle is that pretension,  which I should be sorry to make too much of. Maria Gostrey and Miss  Stackpole then are cases, each, of the light ficelle, not of the true  agent; they may run beside the coach \"for all they are worth,\" they may  cling to it till they are out of breath (as poor Miss Stackpole all so  visibly does), but neither, all the while, so much as gets her foot on  the step, neither ceases for a moment to tread the dusty road. Put it  even that they are like the fishwives who helped to bring back to Paris  from Versailles, on that most ominous day of the first half of the  French Revolution, the carriage of the royal family. The only thing  is that I may well be asked, I acknowledge, why then, in the present  fiction, I have suffered Henrietta (of whom we have indubitably too  much) so officiously, so strangely, so almost inexplicably, to pervade.  I will presently say what I can for that anomaly--and in the most  conciliatory fashion.    A point I wish still more to make is that if my relation of confidence  with the actors in my drama who WERE, unlike Miss Stackpole, true  agents, was an excellent one to have arrived at, there still remained my  relation with the reader, which was another affair altogether and as to  which I felt no one to be trusted but myself. That solicitude was to be  accordingly expressed in the artful patience with which, as I have  said, I piled brick upon brick. The bricks, for the whole  counting-over--putting for bricks little touches and inventions and  enhancements by the way--affect me in truth as well-nigh innumerable and  as ever so scrupulously fitted together and packed-in. It is an effect  of detail, of the minutest; though, if one were in this connexion to say  all, one would express the hope that the general, the ampler air of the  modest monument still survives. I do at least seem to catch the key to  a part of this abundance of small anxious, ingenious illustration as I  recollect putting my finger, in my young woman's interest, on the most  obvious of her predicates. \"What will she 'do'? Why, the first thing  she'll do will be to come to Europe; which in fact will form, and all  inevitably, no small part of her principal adventure. Coming to  Europe is even for the 'frail vessels,' in this wonderful age, a mild  adventure; but what is truer than that on one side--the side of their  independence of flood and field, of the moving accident, of battle and  murder and sudden death--her adventures are to be mild? Without her  sense of them, her sense FOR them, as one may say, they are next to  nothing at all; but isn't the beauty and the difficulty just in showing  their mystic conversion by that sense, conversion into the stuff of  drama or, even more delightful word still, of 'story'?\" It was all  as clear, my contention, as a silver bell. Two very good instances, I  think, of this effect of conversion, two cases of the rare chemistry,  are the pages in which Isabel, coming into the drawing-room at  Gardencourt, coming in from a wet walk or whatever, that rainy  afternoon, finds Madame Merle in possession of the place, Madame  Merle seated, all absorbed but all serene, at the piano, and deeply  recognises, in the striking of such an hour, in the presence there,  among the gathering shades, of this personage, of whom a moment before  she had never so much as heard, a turning-point in her life. It is  dreadful to have too much, for any artistic demonstration, to dot one's  i's and insist on one's intentions, and I am not eager to do it now; but  the question here was that of producing the maximum of intensity with  the minimum of strain.    The interest was to be raised to its pitch and yet the elements to be  kept in their key; so that, should the whole thing duly impress, I might  show what an \"exciting\" inward life may do for the person leading it  even while it remains perfectly normal. And I cannot think of a more  consistent application of that ideal unless it be in the long statement,  just beyond the middle of the book, of my young woman's extraordinary  meditative vigil on the occasion that was to become for her such a  landmark. Reduced to its essence, it is but the vigil of searching  criticism; but it throws the action further forward that twenty  \"incidents\" might have done. It was designed to have all the vivacity  of incidents and all the economy of picture. She sits up, by her dying  fire, far into the night, under the spell of recognitions on which she  finds the last sharpness suddenly wait. It is a representation simply  of her motionlessly SEEING, and an attempt withal to make the mere still  lucidity of her act as \"interesting\" as the surprise of a caravan or the  identification of a pirate. It represents, for that matter, one of the  identifications dear to the novelist, and even indispensable to him;  but it all goes on without her being approached by another person and  without her leaving her chair. It is obviously the best thing in the  book, but it is only a supreme illustration of the general plan. As to  Henrietta, my apology for whom I just left incomplete, she exemplifies,  I fear, in her superabundance, not an element of my plan, but only  an excess of my zeal. So early was to begin my tendency to OVERTREAT,  rather than undertreat (when there was choice or danger) my subject.  (Many members of my craft, I gather, are far from agreeing with me, but  I have always held overtreating the minor disservice.) \"Treating\" that  of \"The Portrait\" amounted to never forgetting, by any lapse, that the  thing was under a special obligation to be amusing. There was the danger  of the noted \"thinness\"--which was to be averted, tooth and nail,  by cultivation of the lively. That is at least how I see it to-day.  Henrietta must have been at that time a part of my wonderful notion of  the lively. And then there was another matter. I had, within the few  preceding years, come to live in London, and the \"international\" light  lay, in those days, to my sense, thick and rich upon the scene. It was  the light in which so much of the picture hung. But that IS another  matter. There is really too much to say.    HENRY JAMES          THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY        CHAPTER I    Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable  than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea. There  are circumstances in which, whether you partake of the tea or not--some  people of course never do,--the situation is in itself delightful. Those  that I have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered  an admirable setting to an innocent pastime. The implements of  the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English  country-house, in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid  summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had waned, but much of it was  left, and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk  would not arrive for many hours; but the flood of summer light had begun  to ebb, the air had grown mellow, the shadows were long upon the smooth,  dense turf. They lengthened slowly, however, and the scene expressed  that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source  of one's enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour. From five o'clock to  eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion  as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons  concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not  of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the  ceremony I have mentioned. The shadows on the perfect lawn were straight  and angular; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep  wicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served, and  of two younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in front of  him. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an unusually large cup,  of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant  colours. He disposed of its contents with much circumspection, holding  it for a long time close to his chin, with his face turned to the house.  His companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent to  their privilege; they smoked cigarettes as they continued to stroll.  One of them, from time to time, as he passed, looked with a certain  attention at the elder man, who, unconscious of observation, rested his  eyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling. The house that rose beyond  the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most  characteristic object in the peculiarly English picture I have attempted  to sketch.    It stood upon a low hill, above the river--the river being the Thames at  some forty miles from London. A long gabled front of red brick, with  the complexion "]]]
