As he foresaw the farther they sailed the more their vague terrors would  increase, to deceive them, he kept two logs; one correct, retained for  his own government, and the other open to general inspection, from which  a certain number of leagues were daily subtracted from the sailing of  the ships.    The crews, though no faint-hearted fellows, had not as yet learned to  place confidence in him.  The slightest thing alarmed them.  When about  one hundred and fifty leagues west of Ferro, they picked up part of the  mast of a large vessel, and the crews fancied that she must have been  wrecked drifting ominously to the entrance of those unknown seas.    About nightfall, on the 13th of September, he for the first time noticed  the variation of the needle, which, instead of pointing to the north  star, varied about half a point.  He remarked that this variation of the  needle increased as he advanced.  He quieted the alarm of his pilots,  when they observed this, by assuring them that the variation was not  caused by any fallacy in the compass, but by the movement of the north  star itself, which, like the other heavenly bodies, described a circle  round the pole.    The explanation appeared so highly plausible and ingenious that it was  readily received.  On the 14th of September they believed that they were  near land, from seeing a heron and a tropical bird, neither of which  were supposed to venture far out to sea.    The following night the mariners were awestruck by beholding a meteor of  great brilliancy--a common phenomenon in those latitudes.  With a  favourable breeze, day after day, the squadron was wafted on, so that it  was unnecessary to shift a single sail.    They now began to observe patches of weeds drifting from the west, which  increased in size as they advanced.  These, together with a white  tropical bird which never sleeps on the water, made Columbus hope that  he was approaching some island; for, as he had come but three hundred  and sixty leagues since leaving the Canary Islands, he supposed the  mainland still to be far off.    The breeze was soft and steady, the water smooth.  The crews were in  high spirits, and every seaman was on the look-out, for a pension of ten  thousand maravedis had been promised to him who should first discover  land.    Alonzo Pinzon in the _Pinta_ took the lead.  On the afternoon of the  13th of September he hailed the Admiral, saying that from the flight of  numerous birds and the appearance of the northern horizon, he thought  there was land in that direction; but Columbus replied that it was  merely a deception of the clouds, and would not alter his course.    The following day there were drizzling showers, and two boobies flew on  board the _Santa Maria_, birds which seldom wander more than twenty  leagues from land.  Sounding, however, no bottom was found.  Unwilling  to waste the present fair breeze, he resolved, whatever others thought,  to keep one bold course until the coast of India was reached.    Notwithstanding, even the favourable breeze began to frighten the  seamen, who imagined that the wind in those regions might always blow  from the east, and if so, would prevent their return to Spain.    Not long after the wind shifted to the south-west, and restored their  courage, proving to them that the wind did not always prevail from the  east.  Several small birds also visited the ships, singing as they  perched on the rigging, thus showing that they were not exhausted by  their flight.  Again the squadron passed among numerous patches of  seaweed, and the crews, ever ready to take alarm, having heard that  ships were sometimes frozen in by ice, fancied that they might be fixed  in the same manner, until they were caught by the nipping hand of  winter.    Then they took it into their heads that the water was growing shoaler,  and expressed their fears that they might run on some sand-banks and be  lost.  Then a whale was seen, which creature Columbus assured them never  went far from land.  Notwithstanding, they became uneasy at the calmness  of the weather, declaring that as the prevailing winds were from the  east, and had not power to disturb the torpid stillness of the ocean,  there was the risk of perishing amidst stagnant and shoreless waters,  and being prevented by contrary winds from ever returning to Spain.    Next a swell got up, which showed that their terrors caused by the calm  were imaginary.  Notwithstanding this, and the favourable signs which  increased his confidence, he feared that after all, breaking into  mutiny, they would compel him to return.    The sailors fancied that their ships were too weak for so long a voyage,  and held secret consultations, exciting each other's discontent.  They  had gone farther than any one before had done.  Who could blame them,  should they, consulting their safety, turn back?    Columbus, though aware of the mutinous disposition of his crew,  maintained a serene and steady countenance, using gentle words with  some, stimulating the pride and avarice of others, and threatening the  refractory.    On the 25th of September the wind again became favourable, and the  squadron resumed its westerly course.  Pinzon now, on examining the  chart, supposed that they must be approaching Cipango.  Columbus desired  to have it returned, and it was thrown on board at the end of a line.    While Columbus and his pilot were studying it, they heard a shout, and  looking up saw Pinzon standing at the stern of the _Pinta_, crying,  \"Land! land!  Senor, I claim my reward!\"    There was indeed an appearance of land to the south-west.  Columbus and  the other officers threw themselves on their knees, and returned thanks  to God.  The seamen, mounting the rigging, strained their eyes in the  direction pointed out, but the morning light put an end to their hopes.    Again with dejected hearts they proceeded, the sea, as before, tranquil,  the breeze propitious, and the weather mild and delightful.  In a day or  two more weeds were seen floating from east to west, but no birds were  visible.  The people again expressed their fears that they had passed  between two islands; but after the lapse of another day the ships were  visited by numberless birds, and various indications of land became more  numerous.  Full of hope, the seamen ascended the rigging, and were  continually crying out that they saw land.    Columbus put a stop to these false alarms, declaring that should any one  assert that they saw land, and it was not discovered within three days,  he should forfeit all claim to the reward.    Pinzon now proposed that they should steer south-west, but Columbus  persisted in keeping a westerly course.  On the 7th of October, at  sunrise, several of the Admiral's crew fancied that they saw land; the  _Nina_ pressing forward, a flag was run up at her masthead, and a gun  was fired,--the preconcerted signal for land.    The captain and his crew were mistaken notwithstanding.  The clouds  which had deceived them melted away.  The crews again became dejected.  But once more flocks of field birds were seen flying through the air to  the south-west, and Columbus, having already run the distance at the  termination of which he had expected to find the island of Cipango,  fancied he might have missed it.  He therefore altered his course to the  south-west.    As the ships advanced the signs of land increased: a heron, a pelican,  and a duck were seen bound in the same direction.  Branches of trees,  and grass, fresh and green, were observed.  The crews, however,  believing these to be mere delusions for leading them on to destruction,  insisted on abandoning the voyage.    Columbus sternly resisted their importunities, and the following day a  branch of thorn, with berries on it, and a staff artificially carved,  with other articles, were picked up, showing that land must be close at  hand.    All gloom and mutiny now gave way to sanguine expectations, and Columbus  promised a doublet of velvet, in addition to the pension to be given by  the sovereign, to whosoever should first see the longed-for shore.    As he walked the high poop of his ship at night, his eye continually  ranging along the horizon, he thought he saw a light glimmering at a  great distance.  Fearing that his hopes might deceive him, he  successively called up two of his officers.  They both saw it,  apparently proceeding from a torch in the bark of a fisherman, or held  in the hand of some person on shore, borne up as he walked.    So uncertain were these gleams that few attached any importance to them.  The ships continued their course until two in the morning, when Rodrigo  de Triana, a seaman on board the _Pinta_, descried land at two leagues  ahead.  A gun was fired from the _Santa Maria_, to give the joyful news.  When all doubt on the subject was banished the ships lay to.    Who can picture the thoughts and feelings of Columbus, as he walked the  deck, impatiently waiting for dawn, which was to show him clearly the  long-sought-for land, with, as he hoped, its spicy groves, its  glittering temples, its gilded cities, and all the splendour of Oriental  civilisation!    As the dawn of the 12th of October, 1492, increased, Columbus first  observed one of the outlying islands of the New World.  It was several  leagues in extent, level, and covered with trees, and populated, for the  naked inhabitants were seen running from all parts to the shore, and  gazing with astonishment at the ships.  The anchors being dropped, the  boats manned, he, richly attired in scarlet and holding the royal  standard, accompanied by the Pinzons in their own boats, approached the  shore.    On landing he threw himself on his knees, and kissing the earth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#4)"],[1,"prince, who  brought them safely to Colchis, whence, as the old stories relate, they  brought back the Golden Fleece. They also brought home the king's  daughter, who married Jason, and ruled his kingdom with him. Of course,  as there was no such thing as a Golden Fleece, the Greeks merely used  this expression to tell about the wealth which they got in the East, and  carried home with them; for the voyage of the \"Argo\" was in reality the  first distant commercial journey undertaken by the Greeks.          VII. THESEUS VISITS THE LABYRINTH.      On coming back from the quest for the Golden Fleece, the heroes returned  to their own homes, where they continued their efforts to make their  people happy.    The'seus, one of the heroes, returned to Athens, and founded a yearly  festival in honor of the goddess Athene. This festival was called  Pan-ath-e-nae'a, which means \"all the worshipers of Athene.\" It proved a  great success, and was a bond of union among the people, who thus  learned each other's customs and manners, and grew more friendly than if  they had always staid at home. Theseus is one of the best-known among  all the Greek heroes. Besides going with Jason in the \"Argo,\" he rid his  country of many robbers, and sailed to Crete. There he visited Minos,  the king, who, having some time before conquered the Athenians, forced  them to send him every year a shipload of youths and maidens, to feed  to a monster which he kept in the Labyrinth.    To free his country from this tribute, Theseus, of his own free will,  went on board the ship. When he reached Crete, he went first into the  Labyrinth, and killed the monster with his sword. Then he found his way  out of the maze by means of a long thread which the king's daughter had  given him. One end of it he carried with him as he entered, while the  other end was fastened to the door.    His old father, AEgeus, who had allowed him to go only after much  persuasion, had told him to change the black sails of his vessel for  white if he were lucky enough to escape. Theseus promised to do so, but  he entirely forgot it in the joy of his return.    AEgeus, watching for the vessel day after day, saw it coming back at  last; and when the sunlight fell upon the black sails, he felt sure that  his son was dead.    His grief was so great at this loss, that he fell from the rock where he  was standing down into the sea, and was drowned. In memory of him, the  body of water near the rock is still known as the AE-ge'an Sea.    When Theseus reached Athens, and heard of his father's grief and sudden  death, his heart was filled with sorrow and remorse, and he loudly  bewailed the carelessness which had cost his father's life.    Theseus now became King of Athens, and ruled his people very wisely for  many years. He took part in many adventures and battles, lost two wives  and a beloved son, and in his grief and old age became so cross and  harsh that his people ceased to love him.    They finally grew so tired of his cruelty, that they all rose up against  him, drove him out of the city, and forced him to take up his abode on  the Island of Scy'ros. Then, fearing that he might return unexpectedly,  they told the king of the island to watch him night and day, and to  seize the first good opportunity to get rid of him. In obedience to  these orders, the king escorted Theseus wherever he went; and one day,  when they were both walking along the edge of a tall cliff, he suddenly  pushed Theseus over it. Unable to defend or save himself, Theseus fell  on some sharp rocks far below, and was instantly killed.    The Athenians rejoiced greatly when they heard of his death; but they  soon forgot his harshness, remembered only his bravery and all the good  he had done them in his youth, and regretted their ingratitude. Long  after, as you will see, his body was carried to Athens, and buried not  far from the A-crop'o-lis, which was a fortified hill or citadel in the  midst of the city. Here the Athenians built a temple over his remains,  and worshiped him as a god.    While Theseus was thus first fighting for his subjects, and then  quarreling with them, one of his companions, the hero Her'cu-les (or  Her'a-cles) went back to the Peloponnesus, where he had been born. There  his descendants, the Her-a-cli'dae, soon began fighting with the Pelopidae  for the possession of the land.    After much warfare, the Heraclidae were driven away, and banished to  Thessaly, where they were allowed to remain only upon condition that  they would not attempt to renew their quarrel with the Pelopidae for a  hundred years.          VIII. THE TERRIBLE PROPHECY.      While Theseus was reigning over the Athenians, the neighboring throne of  Thebes, in Boeotia, was occupied by King La'ius and Queen Jo-cas'ta.  In those days the people thought they could learn about the future by  consulting the oracles, or priests who dwelt in the temples, and  pretended to give mortals messages from the gods.    Hoping to learn what would become of himself and of his family, Laius  sent rich gifts to the temple at Delphi, asking what would befall him in  the coming years. The messenger soon returned, but, instead of bringing  cheerful news, he tremblingly repeated the oracle's words: \"King Laius,  you will have a son who will murder his father, marry his mother, and  bring destruction upon his native city!\"    This news filled the king's heart with horror; and when, a few months  later, a son was born to him, he made up his mind to kill him rather  than let him live to commit such fearful crimes. But Laius was too  gentle to harm a babe, and so ordered a servant to carry the child out  of the town and put him to death.    The man obeyed the first part of the king's orders; but when he had come  to a lonely spot on the mountain, he could not make up his mind to kill  the poor little babe. Thinking that the child would soon die if left on  this lonely spot, the servant tied him to a tree, and, going back to the  city, reported that he had gotten rid of him.    No further questions were asked, and all thought that the child was  dead. It was not so, however. His cries had attracted the attention of a  passing shepherd, who carried him home, and, being too poor to keep him,  took him to the King of Corinth. As the king had no children, he gladly  adopted the little boy.    When the queen saw that the child's ankles were swollen by the cord by  which he had been hung to the tree, she tenderly cared for him, and  called him OEd'i-pus, which means \"the swollen-footed.\" This nickname  clung to the boy, who grew up thinking that the King and Queen of  Corinth were his real parents.          IX. THE SPHINX'S RIDDLE.      When OEdipus was grown up, he once went to a festival, where his proud  manners so provoked one of his companions, that he taunted him with  being only a foundling. OEdipus, seeing the frightened faces around  him, now for the first time began to think that perhaps he had not been  told the truth about his parentage. So he consulted an oracle.    Instead of giving him a plain answer,--a thing which the oracles were  seldom known to do,--the voice said, \"OEdipus, beware! You are doomed  to kill your father, marry your mother, and bring destruction upon your  native city!\"    Horrified at this prophecy, and feeling sure that the King and Queen of  Corinth were his parents, and that the oracle's predictions threatened  misfortunes to them, OEdipus made up his mind to leave home forever.  He did not even dare to return to bid his family good-by, and he started  out alone and on foot to seek his fortunes elsewhere.    As he walked, he thought of his misfortunes, and grew very bitter  against the cruel goddess of fate, whom he had been taught to fear. He  fancied that this goddess could rule things as she pleased, and that it  was she who had said he would commit the dreadful crimes which he was  trying to avoid.    After several days' aimless wandering, OEdipus came at last to some  crossroads. There he met an old man riding in a chariot, and preceded by  a herald, who haughtily bade OEdipus make way for his master.    As OEdipus had been brought up as a prince, he was in the habit of  seeing everybody make way for him. He therefore proudly refused to stir;  and when the herald raised his staff to strike, OEdipus drew his sword  and killed him.    The old man, indignant at this deed of violence, stepped out of his  chariot and attacked OEdipus. Now, the young man did not know that it  was his father Laius whom he thus met for the first time, so he fell  upon and killed him also. The servants too were all slain when they in  turn attacked him; and then OEdipus calmly continued his journey,  little suspecting that the first part of the oracle's prediction had  been fulfilled.    Soon after this fight, OEdipus came to the city of Thebes. The streets  were filled with excited people, all talking at once; and the young  prince, in listening to what they said, soon learned the cause of their  excitement.    [Illustration: After a few moments' deep thought, OEdipus answered.]    It seems that a terrible monster called the Sphinx had taken up its  station on one of the principal roads leading to the town, and would  allow no one to pass who could not answer a riddle which it asked. This  creature had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, and the wings of  an eagle; and, as it ate up all those who could not guess its riddle,  the people were very much frightened.    Many persons had already been slain; for, although the bravest men had  gone out to kill it, they had lost their lives in the attempt, as no one  could harm it unless he guessed the mysterious riddle.    Laius, the king, hoping to learn from the oracle at Delphi the answer to  the riddle, had ridden off in his chariot; but the people grew more  excited still, when a messenger came running into the town, and said  that the king and all his servants had been"]]]
