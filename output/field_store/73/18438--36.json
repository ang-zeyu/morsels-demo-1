The large proportion of  tannin which both species contain in their unripe state, makes them  very useful in treating diarrhoea and dysentery. They are administered  in the form of a decoction, by enema. The sap of the trunk is very  irritating. The roots are used by the American Indians to treat  epilepsy. Lemon juice is the antidote for the sap of this species.    I wish to call attention to the similarity of the common name of this  plant to another entirely distinct species commonly used in the Tagalo  therapeutics; namely, the _anonang_ (Cordia), with which it must not  be confused.    Botanical Description.--Tree 10° high with leaves lanceolate,  pubescent. Flowers in a sort of umbel. Corolla like that of  _A. squamosa_. Fruit without the plainly visible tubercles of the  foregoing species, their presence being merely suggested by a sort  of net traced on the surface.        _A. muricata_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Guanábano_, _Goyabano_, Sp.-Fil.    Uses.--The ripe fruit possesses antiscorbutic properties; the unripe  fruit is used in treating dysentery. It is said that the ripe fruit  is used in diseases of the liver.    Botanical Description.--Tree with leaves oval, alternate and  glabrous. Flower solitary, terminal, whitish. The fruit is much larger  than that of the other species, is covered with scales that end in  a soft point or thorn and has a very pronounced acid taste.    Habitat.--All three species are common in all parts of the Archipelago.          MENISPERMACEÆ.    Moonseed Family.        _Tinospora crispa_, Miers. (_Menispermum crispum_, L.; _M. rimosum_,  Blanco; _Cocculus crispus_, DC.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Makabuhay_, Tag.    Uses.--Makabuhay is one of the most widely known and used plants in the  Philippines; a sort of panacea applied to all bodily afflictions. Its  Tagalo name means literally \"you may live.\" A shoot deprived of roots  and dropped in some moist place is soon covered with bright green  leaves and adventitious roots. This peculiarity of the plant made  it possible for me to take a large number of sprouts from Manila to  Paris where they arrived perfectly fresh after a voyage of forty days,  during which they lay almost forgotten in the ship and the cars.    The stem is the part employed in medicine. A decoction is  given internally in the various forms of malarial fever and of  dyspepsia. Externally it is most useful as a wash for ulcers of all  kinds, rapidly improving their appearance.    In India the species _T. cordifolia_ is used; it differs but little  from _T. crispa_. It is official in the Pharmacopoeia and has been  introduced into Europe. _T. cordifolia_ has given excellent results in  the mild forms of intermittent fever; in general debility following  long and severe cases of illness; in chronic rheumatism, and in the  second stage of syphilis. As the two species are so much alike we  shall add the preparations and dose of _T. cordifolia_ which we have  used on several occasions with good results.    Tincture of T. cordifolia.--Stems of the dried plant, 100  grams. Alcohol 21° (Cartier), 500 cc. Macerate seven days in a closed  vessel stirring from time to time. After decanting add enough alcohol  (21°) to bring the quantity up to 500 cc., and filter.    Dose.--4-8 grams.    Maceration.--Fresh stems cut in small pieces, 30 grams, water 300  grams. Macerate for two hours and filter.    Dose.--30-90 cc. a day.    Extract.--Dry makabuhay in small pieces 500 grams. Water 2 1/2  liters. Macerate for twelve hours, filter the liquid and express the  macerated drug which is then macerated a second time in 2 1/2 liters  of water. Express again, unite the two liquids and filter. Evaporate  in a water-bath to the consistency of a pill mass.    Dose.--1/2-1 1/2 grams a day in fractional doses.    Botanical Description.--A vine whose runners entwine themselves among  the tops of the highest trees, giving off many adventitious roots which  seek the earth. The stem is covered with projecting tubercles. Leaves  heart-shaped, pointed, entire with five well-marked nerves. Flowers  yellowish-green, dioecious, growing in axillary racemes. The male  flowers have a corolla of six petals, the three smaller ones arranged  alternately. In the female flower the stamens are represented by three  glands situated at the base of the petals. Fruit, an elliptical drupe.        _Anamirta Cocculus_, Wight & Arn. (_Menispermum Cocculus_, (L.) Blanco;  _M. lacunosum_, Famk; _Cocculus lacunosus_, _C. suberosus_, DC.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Laktang_, _Liktang_, _Suma_, _Lanta_, _Lintang bagin_,  _Tuba_, _Balasin_, _Bayati_, Tag., Vis., Pam.    Uses.--One of the uses to which the India berries (_Cocas de Levante_)  are put in the Philippines, is to throw them into small sluggish  streams or into lakes with the object of intoxicating the fish which  soon come to the surface and float there as if dead. This custom  is very extensive in Malaysia, in India and even in Europe, where,  in order to avoid the cases of poisoning which this practice has  occasioned in the consumers of fish taken in this way, it has been  found necessary to forbid the sale of the berries except in the  pharmacies. These restrictions are practiced in France.    In the Binondo market in Manila the root of this plant may be found in  abundance; it is yellow and very bitter. The natives use the infusion  (5-10 grams to 300 cc. of water) in fevers, dyspepsia and menstrual  derangements. In India also the root is used in the same complaints.    The fruit contains the highly toxic principle _picrotoxin_, and others  as follows:    _Menispermin_ (C_18_H_24_N_2_O_2_) is an alkaloid which crystallizes  in pyramidal prisms, is soluble in alcohol and ether and insoluble  in water. Hot nitric acid converts it into oxalic acid and a yellow  substance of a resinous appearance.    _Picrotoxin_ (C_30_H_24_O_13_) is not an alkaloid as may be seen from  its formula. Its properties are not well known at the present time. It  crystallizes in small quadrilateral prisms, white and transparent,  or in needles grouped in stars. No odor, taste bitter, insoluble  in water, partly soluble in alcohol and in ether, freely soluble in  acids and alkalies. A solution in concentrated sulphuric acid has a  saffron-yellow color. Nitric acid transforms it into oxalic acid.    _Picrotoxinin_ exists in picrotoxin in the proportion of 32 to 100,  and may be separated by boiling in benzine. It is bitter, poisonous,  reduced by Fehling's solution and nitrate of silver. Sixty-six  per cent. of _picrotoxin_ consists of another bitter substance,  non-poisonous--_picrotin_, which is insoluble in benzine and is reduced  by Fehling's solution and nitrate of silver. Lastly, _anamirtin_  is found in the mother water of picrotoxin; it is not bitter, not  poisonous, and not reducible by the aforementioned reagents.    The fruit of the _anamirta_, the \"coca de Levante\" is an acrid,  narcotic poison, which may not be employed internally; its uses are  limited to external medication. In the Pharmacopoeia of India is  given the formula for a parasiticide ointment, highly recommended in  the treatment of pediculi:      _Unguentum anamirtæ_:                   4 grams Cocculus berries, powdered,                30 grams Vaseline.              M.  Fiat unguentum.      In applying this ointment it is necessary to make sure that there  is no wound or abrasion of the skin through which absorption might  take place.    Botanical Description.--A vine with leaves alternate, entire, glabrous,  broadly oval, pointed, with 5 nerves which unite at the base, long  petioles. Flowers dioecious, in compound racemes. Male flowers consist  of a perianth without corolla, the sepals arranged by threes in two or  three whorls. The end of the receptacle expanded like a bead, bears  a large number of stamens in 6 vertical series, with anthers sessile  and 4-lobed. Female flowers analogous as regards the perianth, with  6-9 sterile stamens. Carpels formed of 5 ovaries, free, unilocular,  containing one ovule each. Fruit, a drupe of a purple color, the size  of a filbert, kidney-shaped, the albumen horny.        _Cissampelos Pareira_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Sansawsansawan_, Tag.; _Chinchaochinchauan_, Sp.-Fil.    Uses.--Although this plant formerly bore the Portuguese name of  _Pareira brava_, the U. S. P. and B. P. recognize now under this  title only the root of _Chondrodendron tomentosum_. It is diuretic  and tonic and apparently exercises an astringent and sedative action  upon the mucous membrane of the genito-urinary organs. The root is  used in acute and chronic cystitis.    In Brazil it is used as a diaphoretic and as such is employed in cases  of venomous snake bites. It is also used there as an emmenagogue and  diuretic, in intermittent fevers, dropsy and suppression of the lochia  in women recently confined.    It is official in the Pharmacopoeia of India.    Decoction.--Root of cissampelos, small pieces,   50 grams.              Water                               600 grams.    Dose.--30-100 grams.    Boil 15 minutes; filter and add enough water to bring the total bulk  up to 600 cc.    Extract.--Root of cissampelos in powder     500 grams.            Water                               5 liters.    Dose.--.5-1 gram.    Digest the powder for 24 hours in 500 cc. water, pour the mixture  into a filter and add water gradually until the percolate amounts to  5 liters. Evaporate the percolate in a water-bath to the consistency  of a pill mass.    Fluid Extract.--This is prepared in the same manner as the extract  and is allowed to remain in the bath until reduced in bulk to 400  grams. It is then removed and 100 grams of alcohol (36°) are added.    Dose.--1.75-7 cc.    Chemical Composition.--Flückiger has isolated a bitter principle  analogous to berberin; also _buxine_ and _paracine_, which latter  received the name"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2641"],[0,"A Room with a View (#4)"],[1,"Street  the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And just  as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:    \"Bless us! Bless us and save us! We've lost the way.\"    Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower  of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But Miss  Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy  had followed her with no misgivings.    \"Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have  taken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!  What are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is  what I call an adventure.\"    Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,  that they should ask the way there.    \"Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, NOT to  look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan't let you carry it. We will  simply drift.\"    Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,  neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the  city abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady  Louisa, and became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy  appeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the  living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can  ever stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from  the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against  circlets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything more  beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her  forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a  mile.    The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or  rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste  out of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly  of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the  great unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,  large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white  facade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It  was Santa Croce. The adventure was over.    \"Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to  them. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into  the church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!\"    \"We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their  rooms. They were so very kind.\"    \"Look at their figures!\" laughed Miss Lavish. \"They walk through my  Italy like a pair of cows. It's very naughty of me, but I would like  to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who  couldn't pass it.\"    \"What would you ask us?\"    Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy's arm, as if to suggest  that she, at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood they  reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when  Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:    \"There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!\"    And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak  flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an  old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.    Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The  beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that  a young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly  into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was  really almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her  local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both  gesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy's eyes partly  because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her  Baedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way  about in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never  be in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,  talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she  was full of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and  humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the  Franciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful  building. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it  contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values  she was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell  her which they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be  enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was  no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved  the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one  that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.    Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of  acquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the  Italian notices--the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into  the church--the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and  out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,  not to spit. She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their  Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that  overtook three Papists--two he-babies and a she-baby--who began their  career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to  the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it  very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with  their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then  retreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy  realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping  to acquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby  stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin,  and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop. Protestant  as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell heavily upon  the prelate's upturned toes.    \"Hateful bishop!\" exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted  forward also. \"Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the sunshine,  little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought  to be. Intolerable bishop!\"    The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful  people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him  not to be superstitious.    \"Look at him!\" said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. \"Here's a mess: a baby hurt,  cold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?\"    The child's legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.  Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an  Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the  rescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she  stiffened the little boy's back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.  He stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.    \"You are a clever woman,\" said Mr. Emerson. \"You have done more than  all the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe in  those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of the  universe--\"    He paused for a phrase.    \"Niente,\" said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.    \"I'm not sure she understands English,\" suggested Lucy.    In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was  determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate,  and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett's civility by some gracious  reference to the pleasant rooms.    \"That woman understands everything,\" was Mr. Emerson's reply. \"But what  are you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the  church?\"    \"No,\" cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. \"I came here with Miss  Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door--it is too  bad!--she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come  in by myself.\"    \"Why shouldn't you?\" said Mr. Emerson.    \"Yes, why shouldn't you come by yourself?\" said the son, addressing the  young lady for the first time.    \"But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.\"    \"Baedeker?\" said Mr. Emerson. \"I'm glad it's THAT you minded. It's worth  minding, the loss of a Baedeker. THAT'S worth minding.\"    Lucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not  sure whither it would lead her.    \"If you've no Baedeker,\" said the son, \"you'd better join us.\" Was this  where the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.    \"Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not  suppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the  child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night. I  hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.\"    \"My dear,\" said the old man gently, \"I think that you are repeating what  you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy; but  you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what  part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a real  pleasure.\"    Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been  furious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one's temper as it  is difficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.  Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the other  hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be  offended with him, or at all events be offended before him. It was at  him that she gazed before replying.    \"I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you  will"]]]
