This embroidery is not a  meaningless fashion, for the lines make the hand look much more  slender and of a better shape. Sewing in the thumbs needs special care  and skill. There must be no puckering, and the seam must not be so  tightly drawn as to leave a red line on the hand when the glove is  taken off. No one person does all the sewing on a glove; it must pass  through a number of hands, each doing a little. Even after all the  care that is given it, a glove is a shapeless thing when it comes from  the sewing machines. It is now carried to a room where stands a long  table with a rather startling row of brass hands of different sizes  stretching up from it. These are heated, the gloves are drawn upon  them, and in a moment they have shape and finish, and are ready to be  inspected and sold.    The glove is so closely associated with the hand and with the person  to whom the hand belongs that in olden times it was looked upon as  representing him. When, for instance, a fair could not be opened  without the presence of some noble, it was enough if he sent his  glove to represent him. To throw down one's glove before a man was to  challenge him to a combat. At the coronation of Queen Elizabeth, as of  many other sovereigns of England, the \"Queen's champion,\" a knight in  full armor, rode into the great hall and threw down his glove, crying,  \"If there be any manner of man that will say and maintain that our  sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth, is not the rightful and undoubted  inheritrix to the imperial crown of this realm of England, I say he  lieth like a false traitor, and therefore I cast him my gage.\"          IV    HOW RAGS AND TREES BECOME PAPER      It was a great day for the children on the farm when the tin peddler  came around. He had a high red wagon, fairly bristling with brooms,  mop-handles, washtubs, water-pails, and brushes. When he opened his  mysterious drawers and caverns, the sunshine flashed upon tin pans,  dippers, dustpans, and basins. Put away rather more choicely were  wooden-handled knives, two-tined forks, and dishes of glass and china;  and sometimes little tin cups painted red or blue and charmingly  gilded, or cooky-cutters in the shape of dogs and horses. All these  rare and delightful articles he was willing to exchange for rags. Is  it any wonder that the thrifty housewife saved her rags with the  utmost care, keeping one bag for white clippings and one for colored?    These peddlers were the great dependence of the paper mills, for the  finest paper is made from linen and cotton rags. When the rags reach  the factory, they are carefully sorted. All day long the sorters sit  before tables whose tops are covered with coarse wire screens, and  from masses of rags they pick out buttons, hooks and eyes, pins, bits  of rubber, and anything else that cannot possibly be made into paper.  At the same time they sort the rags carefully into different grades,  and with a knife shaped like a small sickle fastened upright to the  table they cut them into small pieces. Some of the dust falls through  the screen; but to remove the rest of it, the cut-up rags are tossed  about in a wire drum. Sometimes they are so dusty that when they come  out of the drum they weigh only nine tenths as much as when they go  in. The dust is out of them, but not the dirt. To remove that, they  are now put into great boilers full of steam; and here they cook and  turn over, and turn over and cook for hours. Lime and sometimes soda  are put with them to cleanse them and remove the coloring material;  but when they are poured out, they look anything but clean, for they  are of a particularly dirty brown; and the water that is drained away  from them looks even more uninteresting. Of course the next step is to  wash this dirty brown mass; and for at least four hours it is scrubbed  in a machine which beats it and rolls it and chops it and tumbles it  about until the wonder is that anything is left of it. All this while,  the water has been flowing through it, coming in clean and going out  dirty; and at length the mass becomes so light a gray that making  white paper of it does not seem quite hopeless. It is now bleached  with chloride of lime, and washed till it is of a creamy white color  and free from the lime, and then beaten again. If you fold a piece of  cheap paper and tear it at the fold, it will tear easily; but if you  do the same thing with paper made of linen and cotton, you will find  it decidedly tough. Moreover, if you look closely at the torn edge of  the latter, you will see the fibers clearly. It is because of the  beating that the fibers are so matted together and thus make the paper  tough. While the pulp is in the beater, the manufacturer puts in the  coloring matter, if he wishes it to be tinted blue or rose or lavender  or any other color. No one would guess that this white or creamy or  azure liquid had ever been the dirty rags that came into the mill and  were sorted on the wire tables. Besides the coloring, a \"filler\" is  usually added at this time, such as kaolin, the fine clay of which  china is made. This fills the pores and gives a smoother surface to  the finished paper--a good thing if too much is not put in. A little  sizing is also added, made of rosin. Save for this sizing, ink would  sink into even the finished paper as it does into blotting paper.  After this, more water is added to the pulp and it is run into tanks.    Now the preparation is completed, and the pulp is pumped to large and  complicated machines which undertake to make it into paper. It first  flows through screens which are shaken all the while as if they were  trembling. This shaking lets the liquid and the finer fibers through,  but holds back the little lumps, if any remain after all the beating  and straining and cutting that it has had. The pulp flows upon an  endless wire screen. Rubber straps at the sides keep it in, but the  extra water drops through the meshes. The pulp is flowing onward, and  so the tiny fibers would naturally straighten out and flow with it,  like sticks in a river; but the wire screen is kept shaking sideways,  and this helps the fibers to interlace, and the paper becomes nearly  as strong one way as the other.    If you hold a sheet of paper up to the light, it will show plainly  what is next done to it. Sometimes you can see that it is marked by  light parallel lines running across it close together, and crossed by  other and stouter lines an inch or two apart. Sometimes the name of  the paper or that of the manufacturer is marked in the same way by  letters lighter than the rest of the sheet. Sometimes the paper is  plain with no markings whatever. This difference is made by what is  called the \"dandy,\" a cylinder covered with wire. For the first, or  \"laid\" paper, the small wires run the length of the cylinder and the  stouter ones around it. Wherever the wires are, the paper is a little  thinner. In some papers this thinness can be seen and felt. For the  second kind of paper the design, or \"watermark,\" is formed by wires a  little thicker than the rest of the covering. For the third, or \"wove\"  paper, the dandy is covered with plain woven wire like that of the  wire cloth; so there are no markings at all. This work can be easily  done because at this point the paper is so moist.    The paper is now not in sheets, but in a long web like a web of cloth.  It passes between felt-covered rollers to press out all the water  possible, then over steam-heated cylinders to be dried, finally going  between cold iron rollers to be made smooth, and is wound on a reel,  trimmed and cut into sheets of whatever size is desired. The finest  note papers are not finished in this way, but are partly dried,  passed through a vat of thin glue, any excess being squeezed off by  rollers, then cut into sheets, and hung up to dry thoroughly at their  leisure.    Paper made of properly prepared linen and cotton is by far the best,  but there are so many new uses for paper that there are not rags  enough in the world to make nearly what is needed. There are scores of  newspapers and magazines where there used to be one; and as for paper  bags and cartons and boxes, there is no limit to their number and  variety. A single manufacturer of pens and pencils calls for four  thousand different sorts and sizes of boxes. School-children's use of  paper instead of slates, the fashion of wrapping Christmas gifts in  white tissue, and the invention of the low-priced cameras have  increased enormously the amount of paper called for. In the attempt to  supply the demand all sorts of materials have been used, such as hemp,  old rope, peat, the stems of flax, straw, the Spanish and African  esparto grass, and especially wood; but much more paper is made of  wood than of all the rest together. Poplar, gum, and chestnut trees,  and especially those trees which bear cones, such as the spruce, fir,  balsam, and pine are used. There are two methods of manufacturing wood  pulp; the mechanical, by grinding up the wood, and the chemical, by  treating it chemically. By the mechanical method the wood is pressed  against a large grindstone which revolves at a high speed. As fast as  the wood is ground off, it is washed away by a current of water, and  strained through a shaking sieve and a revolving screen which drives  out part of the water by centrifugal force. In a great vat of pulp a  drum covered with wire cloth revolves, and on it a thin sheet of pulp  settles. Felting, pressed against this sheet, carries it onward  through rolls. The sheets are pressed between coarse sacking. Such  paper is very poor stuff. In its manufacture the fiber of the wood is  so ground up that it has little strength. It is used for cardboard,  cartons, and packing-papers. Unfortunately, it is also used for  newspapers; and while it is a good thing for some of them to drop to  pieces, it is a great loss not to have the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28570"],[0,"Astronomy of To-day: A Popular Introduction in Non-Technical Language (#4)"],[1,"un, which is several hundred times larger than all the  planets and satellites of the system rolled together. Next comes Jupiter  and afterwards the other planets in the following order of  size:--Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, the Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury.  Very much smaller than any of these are the asteroids, of which Ceres,  the largest, is less than 500 miles in diameter. It is, by the way, a  strange fact that the zone of asteroids should mark the separation of  the small planets from the giant ones. The following table, giving  roughly the various diameters of the sun and the principal planets in  miles, will clearly illustrate the great discrepancy in size which  prevails in the system.    Sun          866,540 miles  Mercury        2,765  \"  Venus          7,826  \"  Earth          7,918  \"  Mars           4,332  \"    ZONE OF ASTEROIDS    Jupiter       87,380  \"  Saturn        73,125  \"  Uranus[3]     34,900  \"  Neptune[3]    32,900  \"    It does not seem possible to arrive at any generalisation from the above  data, except it be to state that there is a continuous increase in size  from Mercury to the earth, and a similar decrease in size from Jupiter  outwards. Were Mars greater than the earth, the planets could then with  truth be said to increase in size up to Jupiter, and then to decrease.  But the zone of asteroids, and the relative smallness of Mars, negative  any attempt to regard the dimensions of the planets as an orderly  sequence.    Next with respect to relative distance from the sun, Venus circulates  nearly twice as far from it as Mercury, the earth nearly three times as  far, and Mars nearly four times. After this, just as we found a sudden  increase in size, so do we meet with a sudden increase in distance.  Jupiter, for instance, is about thirteen times as far as Mercury, Saturn  about twenty-five times, Uranus about forty-nine times, and Neptune  about seventy-seven. (See Fig. 2, p. 21.)    It will thus be seen how enormously the solar system was enlarged in  extent by the discovery of the outermost planets. The finding of Uranus  plainly doubled its breadth; the finding of Neptune made it more than  half as broad again. Nothing indeed can better show the import of these  great discoveries than to take a pair of compasses and roughly set out  the above relative paths in a series of concentric circles upon a large  sheet of paper, and then to consider that the path of Saturn was the  supposed boundary of our solar system prior to the year 1781.    We have seen that the usual shape of celestial bodies themselves is  spherical. Of what form then are their paths, or _orbits_, as these are  called? One might be inclined at a venture to answer \"circular,\" but  this is not the case. The orbits of the planets cannot be regarded as  true circles. They are ovals, or, to speak in technical language,  \"ellipses.\" Their ovalness or \"ellipticity\" is, however, in each case  not by any means of the same degree. Some orbits--for instance, that of  the earth--differ only slightly from circles; while others--those of  Mars or Mercury, for example--are markedly elliptic. The orbit of the  tiny planet Eros is, however, far and away the most elliptic of all, as  we shall see when we come to deal with that little planet in detail.    It has been stated that the sun and planets are always rotating. The  various rates at which they do so will, however, be best appreciated by  a comparison with the rate at which the earth itself rotates.    But first of all, let us see what ground we have, if any, for asserting  that the earth rotates at all?    If we carefully watch the heavens we notice that the background of the  sky, with all the brilliant objects which sparkle in it, appears to turn  once round us in about twenty-four hours; and that the pivot upon which  this movement takes place is situated somewhere near what is known to us  as the _Pole Star_. This was one of the earliest facts noted with regard  to the sky; and to the men of old it therefore seems as if the heavens  and all therein were always revolving around the earth. It was natural  enough for them to take this view, for they had not the slightest idea  of the immense distance of the celestial bodies, and in the absence of  any knowledge of the kind they were inclined to imagine them  comparatively near. It was indeed only after the lapse of many  centuries, when men had at last realised the enormous gulf which  separated them from even the nearest object in the sky, that a more  reasonable opinion began to prevail. It was then seen that this  revolution of the heavens about the earth could be more easily and more  satisfactorily explained by supposing a mere rotation of the solid earth  about a fixed axis, pointed in the direction of the polar star. The  probability of such a rotation on the part of the earth itself was  further strengthened by the observations made with the telescope. When  the surfaces of the sun and planets were carefully studied these bodies  were seen to be rotating. This being the case, there could not surely  be much hesitation in granting that the earth rotated also; particularly  when it so simply explained the daily movement of the sky, and saved men  from the almost inconceivable notion that the whole stupendous vaulted  heaven was turning about them once in every twenty-four hours.    If the sun be regularly observed through a telescope, it will gradually  be gathered from the slow displacement of sunspots across its face,  their disappearance at one edge and their reappearance again at the  other edge, that it is rotating on an axis in a period of about  twenty-six days. The movement, too, of various well-known markings on  the surfaces of the planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn proves to us that  these bodies are rotating in periods, which are about twenty-four hours  for the first, and about ten hours for each of the other two. With  regard, however, to Uranus and Neptune there is much more uncertainty,  as these planets are at such great distances that even our best  telescopes give but a confused view of the markings which they display;  still a period of rotation of from ten to twelve hours appears to be  accepted for them. On the other hand the constant blaze of sunlight in  the neighbourhood of Mercury and Venus equally hampers astronomers in  this quest. The older telescopic observers considered that the rotation  periods of these two planets were about the same as that of the earth;  but of recent years the opinion has been gaining ground that they turn  round on their axes in exactly the same time as they revolve about the  sun. This question is, however, a very doubtful one, and will be again  referred to later on; but, putting it on one side, it will be seen from  what we have said above, that the rotation periods of the other planets  of our system are usually about twenty-four hours, or under. The fact  that the rotation period of the sun should run into _days_ need not seem  extraordinary when one considers its enormous size.    The periods taken by the various planets to revolve around the sun is  the next point which has to be considered. Here, too, it is well to  start with the earth's period of revolution as the standard, and to see  how the periods taken by the other planets compare with it.    The earth takes about 365-1/4 days to revolve around the sun. This  period of time is known to us as a \"year.\" The following table shows in  days and years the periods taken by each of the other planets to make a  complete revolution round the sun:--    Mercury  about  88 days.  Venus     \"    226   \"  Mars      \"      1 year and 321 days.  Jupiter   \"     11 years and 313 days.  Saturn    \"     29 years and 167 days.  Uranus    \"     84 years and 7 days.  Neptune   \"    164 years and 284 days.    From these periods we gather an important fact, namely, that the nearer  a planet is to the sun the faster it revolves.    Compared with one of our years what a long time does an Uranian, or  Neptunian, \"year\" seem? For instance, if a \"year\" had commenced in  Neptune about the middle of the reign of George II., that \"year\" would  be only just coming to a close; for the planet is but now arriving back  to the position, with regard to the sun, which it then occupied. Uranus,  too, has only completed a little more than 1-1/2 of its \"years\" since  Herschel discovered it.    Having accepted the fact that the planets are revolving around the sun,  the next point to be inquired into is:--What are the positions of their  orbits, or paths, relatively to each other?    Suppose, for instance, the various planetary orbits to be represented by  a set of hoops of different sizes, placed one within the other, and the  sun by a small ball in the middle of the whole; in what positions will  these hoops have to be arranged so as to imitate exactly the true  condition of things?    First of all let us suppose the entire arrangement, ball and hoops, to  be on one level, so to speak. This may be easily compassed by imagining  the hoops as floating, one surrounding the other, with the ball in the  middle of all, upon the surface of still water. Such a set of objects  would be described in astronomical parlance as being _in the same  plane_. Suppose, on the other hand, that some of these floating hoops  are tilted with regard to the others, so that one half of a hoop rises  out of the water and the other half consequently sinks beneath the  surface. This indeed is the actual case with regard to the planetary  orbits. They do not by any means lie all exactly in the same plane. Each  one of them is tilted, or _inclined_, a little with respect to the plane  of the earth's orbit, which astronomers, for convenience, regard as the  _level_ of the solar system. This tilting, or \"inclination,\" is, in the  larger planets, greatest for the orbit of Mercury, least for that of  Uranus. Mercury's orbit is inclined to that of the earth at an angle"]]]
