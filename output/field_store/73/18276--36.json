It then occurred  to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in  the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more  rapidly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these  causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each  species, since they evidently do not increase regularly from year to  year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been densely crowded  with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous  and constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask  the question, Why do some die and some live? And the answer was  clearly, that on the whole the best fitted live. From the effects of  disease the most healthy escaped; from enemies the strongest, the  swiftest, or the most cunning; from famine the best hunters or those  with the best digestion; and so on. Then it suddenly flashed upon me  that this self-acting process would necessarily _improve the race_,  because in every generation the inferior would inevitably be killed  off and the superior would remain--that is, _the fittest would  survive_.\"[27] We need not apologise for this long quotation, it is a  tribute to Darwin's magnanimous colleague, the Nestor of the  evolutionist camp,--and it probably indicates the line of thought  which Darwin himself followed. It is interesting also to recall the  fact that in 1852, when Herbert Spencer wrote his famous _Leader_  article on \"The Development Hypothesis\" in which he argued powerfully  for the thesis that the whole animate world is the result of an  age-long process of natural transformation, he wrote for _The  Westminster Review_ another important essay, \"A Theory of Population  deduced from the General Law of Animal Fertility,\" towards the close  of which he came within an ace of recognising that the struggle for  existence was a factor in organic evolution. At a time when pressure  of population was practically interesting men's minds, Darwin,  Wallace, and Spencer were being independently led from a social  problem to a biological theory. There could be no better illustration,  as Prof. Patrick Geddes has pointed out, of the Comtian thesis that  science is a \"social phenomenon.\"    Therefore, as far more important than any further ferreting out of  vague hints of Natural Selection in books which Darwin never read, we  would indicate by a quotation the view that the central idea in  Darwinism is correlated with contemporary social evolution. \"The  substitution of Darwin for Paley as the chief interpreter of the order  of nature is currently regarded as the displacement of an  anthropomorphic view by a purely scientific one: a little reflection,  however, will show that what has actually happened has been merely the  replacement of the anthropomorphism of the eighteenth century by that  of the nineteenth. For the place vacated by Paley's theological and  metaphysical explanation has simply been occupied by that suggested to  Darwin and Wallace by Malthus in terms of the prevalent severity of  industrial competition, and those phenomena of the struggle for  existence which the light of contemporary economic theory has enabled  us to discern, have thus come to be temporarily exalted into a  complete explanation of organic progress.\"[28] It goes without saying  that the idea suggested by Malthus was developed by Darwin into a  biological theory which was then painstakingly verified by being used  as an interpretative formula, and that the validity of a theory so  established is not affected by what suggested it, but the practical  question which this line of thought raises in the mind is this: if  Biology did thus borrow with such splendid results from social theory,  why should we not more deliberately repeat the experiment?    Darwin was characteristically frank and generous in admitting that the  principle of Natural Selection had been independently recognised by  Dr. W. C. Wells in 1813 and by Mr. Patrick Matthew in 1831, but he had  no knowledge of these anticipations when he published the first  edition of _The Origin of Species_. Wells, whose \"Essay on Dew\" is  still remembered, read in 1813 before the Royal Society a short paper  entitled \"An Account of a White Female, part of whose skin resembles  that of a Negro\" (published in 1818). In this communication, as Darwin  said, \"he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some  degree, and, secondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated  animals by selection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this  latter case 'by art, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more  slowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted  for the country which they inhabit.'\"[29] Thus Wells had the clear  idea of survival dependent upon a favourable variation, but he makes  no more use of the idea and applies it only to man. There is not in  the paper the least hint that the author ever thought of generalising  the remarkable sentence quoted above.    Of Mr. Patrick Matthew, who buried his treasure in an appendix to a  work on _Naval Timber and Arboriculture_, Darwin said that \"he clearly  saw the full force of the principle of natural selection.\" In 1860  Darwin wrote--very characteristically--about this to Lyell: \"Mr.  Patrick Matthew publishes a long extract from his work on _Naval  Timber and Arboriculture_, published in 1831, in which he briefly but  completely anticipates the theory of Natural Selection. I have ordered  the book, as some passages are rather obscure, but it is certainly, I  think, a complete but not developed anticipation. Erasmus always said  that surely this would be shown to be the case some day. Anyhow, one  may be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work on Naval  Timber.\"[30]    De Quatrefages and De Varigny have maintained that the botanist Naudin  stated the theory of evolution by natural selection in 1852. He  explains very clearly the process of artificial selection, and says  that in the garden we are following Nature's method. \"We do not think  that Nature has made her species in a different fashion from that in  which we proceed ourselves in order to make our variations.\" But, as  Darwin said, \"he does not show how selection acts under nature.\"  Similarly it must be noted in regard to several pre-Darwinian pictures  of the struggle for existence (such as Herder's, who wrote in 1790  \"All is in struggle ... each one for himself\" and so on), that a  recognition of this is only the first step in Darwinism.    Profs. E. Perrier and H. F. Osborn have called attention to a  remarkable anticipation of the selection-idea which is to be found in  the speculations of Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1825-1828) on the  evolution of modern Crocodilians from the ancient Teleosaurs. Changing  environment induced changes in the respiratory system and far-reaching  consequences followed. The atmosphere, acting upon the pulmonary  cells, brings about \"modifications which are favourable or destructive  ('funestes'); these are inherited, and they influence all the rest of  the organisation of the animal because if these modifications lead to  injurious effects the animals which exhibit them perish and are  replaced by others of a somewhat different form, a form changed so as  to be adapted to (a la convenance) the new environment.\"    Prof. E. B. Poulton[31] has shown that the anthropologist James Cowles  Prichard (1786-1848) must be included even in spite of himself among  the precursors of Darwin. In some passages of the second edition of  his _Researches into the Physical History of Mankind_ (1826), he  certainly talks evolution and anticipates Prof. Weismann in denying  the transmission of acquired characters. He is, however, sadly  self-contradictory and his evolutionism weakens in subsequent  editions--the only ones that Darwin saw. Prof. Poulton finds in  Prichard's work a recognition of the operation of Natural Selection.  \"After inquiring how it is that 'these varieties are developed and  preserved in connexion with particular climates and differences of  local situation,' he gives the following very significant answer: 'One  cause which tends to maintain this relation is obvious. Individuals  and families, and even whole colonies perish and disappear in climates  for which they are, by peculiarity of constitution, not adapted. Of  this fact proofs have been already mentioned.'\" Mr. Francis Darwin and  Prof. A. C. Seward discuss Prichard's \"anticipations\" in _More Letters  of Charles Darwin_, Vol. _I._ p. 43, and come to the conclusion that  the evolutionary passages are entirely neutralised by others of an  opposite trend. There is the same difficulty with Buffon.    Hints of the idea of Natural Selection have been detected elsewhere.  James Watt,[32] for instance, has been reported as one of the  anticipators (1851). But we need not prolong the inquiry further,  since Darwin did not know of any anticipations until after he had  published the immortal work of 1859, and since none of those who got  hold of the idea made any use of it. What Darwin did was to follow the  clue which Malthus gave him, to realise, first by genius and  afterwards by patience, how the complex and subtle struggle for  existence works out a natural selection of those organisms which vary  in the direction of fitter adaptation to the conditions of their life.  So much success attended his application of the Selection-formula that  for a time he regarded Natural Selection as almost the sole factor in  evolution, variations being pre-supposed; gradually, however, he came  to recognise that there was some validity in the factors which had  been emphasised by Lamarck and by Buffon, and in his well known  summing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#4)"],[1,"editor of the Tageszeitung, said: \"The  substance of the proposals is to create a situation making it  unnecessary for Americans to travel to Europe on ships under an enemy  flag,\" and the Taegliche Rundschau said that the \"answer with  gratifying decisiveness, guards the conscience of the nation in the  question of continuing the submarine war,\" but it criticises the note  for possibly going too far in making concessions, which \"may prove  impracticable and result in weakening the submarine war.\"    The unfavorable reception of Germany's note in the United States, as  reported through English and French agencies, was read in Berlin with  incredulity.    The Kreuz-Zeitung, the Tageszeitung, and the Boersen Zeitung expressed  the belief that British and French news agencies had purposely  selected unfavorable editorial expressions from the American  newspapers for the sake of the effect they would have in Great Britain  and France.    \"Regarding the reception of the German note in America,\" the  Kreuz-Zeitung said, \"several additional reports from British sources  are now at hand. Reuter's Telegram Company presents about a dozen  short sentences from as many American papers. Were these really  approximately a faithful picture of the thought of the American press  as a unit, we should have to discard every hope of a possibility of an  understanding. The conception of a great majority of the German people  is that we showed in our note an earnest desire to meet, as far as  possibly justified, American interests.\"    Like the Berlin press, German-American newspapers were unanimous in  praise of the German note; to the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung it  appeared a \"sincere effort to meet the questions involved\" and as  \"eminently satisfactory.\" The New Yorker Herold thought that any one  with \"even a spark of impartiality\" would have to admit the \"quiet,  conciliatory tone of the German note\" as \"born of the consciousness in  the heart of every German that Germany did not want the war\"; that  after it was forced on her she \"waged it with honorable means.\" The  Illinois Staats-Zeitung of Chicago declared it to be the \"just demand  of Germany\" that Americans should not \"by their presence on hostile  boats try to protect war materials to be delivered by a friendly  nation at a hostile shore.\" From the Cincinnati Freie Presse came the  comment that Washington \"has no business to procure safety on the  ocean for British ships carrying ammunition.\"    The American newspapers were nearly unanimous in adverse criticism of  the note. THE NEW YORK TIMES said that Germany's request was \"to  suspend the law of nations, the laws of war and of humanity for her  benefit.\" The Chicago Herald declared that the German answer \"is  disappointing to all who had hoped that it would clearly open the way  to a continuance of friendly relations.\" While the San Francisco  Chronicle discerned in the note \"an entire absence of the belligerent  spirit,\" it found that \"Germany is asking us to abridge certain of our  rights on the high seas.\" To the Denver Post the reply was the  \"extreme of arrogance, selfishness, and obstinacy,\" while The Atlanta  (Ga.) Constitution remarks that German words and German deeds are  separate matters: \"The all-important fact remains that since President  Wilson's first note was transmitted to that country, Germany has given  us no single reasonable cause of complaint.\" The Louisville (Ky.)  Courier-Journal believes the German reply would carry more weight and  persuasion \"if it could be considered wholly and apart as an _ex  parte_ statement.\" \"Without equivocation and with a politeness of  offensively insinuating,\" the Boston Transcript concludes, \"Germany  rejects each and all of our demands and attempts to bargain with  respect to the future.\"      ON THE AMERICAN NOTE OF JULY 21    Publication of the American note in Berlin was delayed until July 25,  owing to difficulty in translating its shades of meaning. While German  statesmen and editors expressed keen appreciation of its literary  style, the press was unanimous in considering the note disappointing,  expressing pained surprise at the American stand. Captain Perseus,  naval critic of the Berlin Tageblatt, said that the note \"expresses a  determination to rob us of the weapon to which we pin the greatest  hopes in the war on England,\" and indicates that the \"pro-British  troublemakers have finally won over the President.\" Count von  Reventlow in the Tageszeitung complains of the note's \"far too  threatening and peremptory tone.\" The Kreuz-Zeitung says: \"We are  trying hard to resist the thought that the United States with its  standpoint as expressed in the note, aims at supporting England,\" and  Georg Bernhard of the Vossische Zeitung believes that yielding to  President Wilson's argument means \"the weakening of Germany to the  enemy's advantage,\" adding that any one who has this in mind \"is not  neutral, but takes sides against Germany and for her enemies.\" The  Boersen Zeitung says it is compelled to say, with regret, that the  note is very unsatisfactory and \"one cannot escape feeling that the  shadow of England stands behind it.\" The New Yorker Staats-Zeitung  says that the note is distinguished for its \"clear language,\" and  quotes the phrase \"deliberately unfriendly\" while noting the demand  for disavowal and reparation. \"Of quite unusual weight,\" the  Staats-Zeitung says, \"is the hint on the fact that the United States  and Germany, so far as the freedom of the seas is concerned, have the  same object in view.\" \"Sharp and clear is it also explained\" that  after the end of the war the United States is \"ready to play the role  of an intermediary, in order to find a practicable way out.\" In fact,  the note handed to the Government in Berlin \"is at the same time meant  for London,\" since it expresses itself as determined to protect  neutrals \"against every one of the warring nations.\" The New Yorker  Herold is \"certain that the complications will be settled amicably,\"  while the Illinois Staats-Zeitung feels that \"apparently our  Government has a secret agreement with England intentionally to  provoke Germany.\"    In praise of this note American press opinion is again nearly  unanimous. The New York World says that \"what the President exacts of  Germany is the minimum that a self-respecting nation can demand.\" The  New York Tribune calls the note an admirable American document. The  Rochester Democrat and Chronicle says it is strongly put, but not too  strongly, and the Boston Herald thinks there is no escape from its  logic. The Philadelphia Public Ledger says \"the final word of  diplomacy has obviously been said,\" and the Administration cannot  \"engage in further debate or yield on any point.\" The Chicago Herald  believes the note is couched in terms that \"no intelligent man would  resent from a neighbor whose friendship he values.\" The St. Louis  Republic says: \"One hundred and twenty-eight years of American history  and tradition speak in President Wilson's vindication.\" The St. Paul  Pioneer Press calls the note \"a great American charter of rights,\" and  the Charleston News and Courier declares that \"we have drawn a line  across which Germany must not step.\" The Portland Oregonian says: \"If  there was any expectation that the President's note to Germany would  yield any measure of American rights or descend from the noble and  impressive determination of the original warning to and demand upon  Germany, it has not been fulfilled.\"          Austria-Hungary's Protest      _An Associated Press dispatch dated London, July 16, says:_    According to an Amsterdam dispatch to Reuter's Telegram Company it is  stated from Vienna that the Austro-Hungarian Minister of Foreign  Affairs sent a note to the American Ambassador at Vienna on June 29,  drawing attention to the fact that commercial business in war material  on a great scale is proceeding between the United States and Great  Britain and her Allies, while Austria-Hungary and Germany are  completely cut off from the American market.    It is set forth in the note that this subject has occupied the  Government of the Dual Monarchy from the very beginning, and, although  the Government is convinced that the American attitude arises from no  other intention than to observe the strictest neutrality and  international agreements, yet \"the question arises whether conditions  as they have developed during the course of the war, certainly  independently of the wish of the American Government, are not of such  a kind as in their effect to turn the intentions of the Washington  Cabinet in a contrary direction.    \"If this question is answered in the affirmative, and its affirmation  cannot be doubted,\" according to the opinion of the Austro-Hungarian  Government, \"then the question follows whether it does not seem  possible, or even necessary, that appropriate measures should be taken  to make fully respected the wish of the American Government to remain  a strictly impartial vis-a-vis of both belligerent parties.\"    The note continues:    \"A neutral government cannot be allowed to trade in contraband  unhindered, if the trade take the form and dimensions whereby the  neutrality of the country will be endangered. The export of war  material from the United States as a proceeding of the present war is  not in consonance with the definition of neutrality. The American  Government, therefore, is undoubtedly entitled to prohibit the export  of war material.    \"Regarding the possible objections that American industry is willing  to supply Austria-Hungary and Germany, which, however, is impossible  owing to the war situation, it may be pointed out that the American  Government is in a position to redress this state of things. It would  be quite sufficient to advise the enemies of Austria-Hungary and  Germany that the supply of foodstuffs and war material would be  suspended if legitimate trade in these articles"]]]
