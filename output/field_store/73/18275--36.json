It was six o'clock and dinner was being served by the flushed and  flustered waiters. Probably a hundred persons sat at the tables in all  stages of intoxication. Hilarity ran high. Most of them were wildly  jolly and gushingly full of good will; but all seemed hungry, and the  odors from the kitchen were appetizing.    I now hoped that the dinner, and especially the hot tea and coffee would  restore some of these people to their senses in order that they might  get up steam in the engines and pull out of this terrible place before  they were too far gone. Dinner was well over in the dining room and I  had not yet eaten. A waiter passed my door. He stopped.    \"Have you eaten dinner?\"    \"No, I have not.\"    \"Don't you want some?\"    \"Well, yes. I think I could eat something.\"    \"I'll bring you some.\" And he was gone.    A few minutes later he entered my stateroom with a big tray, and putting  it upon the edge of the upper berth he left me. I ate my dinner from the  tray while standing, and felt better.    An hour afterward the drunken officials had been coaxed into going  ashore; the furnace in the engine room was crammed with wood; the  partially sobered pilot resumed his place at the wheel; the captain had  pulled himself together as best he could under the threats of the lawyer  from Seattle, and the steamer moved away from the bank, going with the  current swiftly towards Dawson. Nothing of further importance occurred  until next morning when our steamer pulled up alongside the dock at  Dawson. It was Monday morning, the thirtieth of July, 1899, and the  weather was beautifully clear. I had been fourteen days coming from  Seattle. Hundreds of people waited upon the dock to see us land, and to  get a glimpse of a new lot of \"Chechakos,\" as all newcomers are called.    Soon after landing I met upon the street an old Seattle friend of my  parents, who knew me instantly and directed me to my father. This man's  kind offer to look up my baggage was accepted, and I trudged down  through the town towards the Klondyke River, where my father and brother  lived. I had no difficulty in finding father, and after the first  surprise and our luncheon were over we proceeded to find my brother at  his work. His astonishment was as great as my father's, and I cannot  truthfully state that either of them were overcome with joy at seeing me  in Dawson. At any other time or place they undoubtedly would have been  delighted, but they were too well acquainted with conditions to wish  another member of their family there in what was probably then the  largest and roughest mining camp in the world. The situation that  presented itself was this. Instead of finding my relatives comfortably  settled in a large and commodious log cabin of their own on the banks of  the Klondyke River, as they had written they were, I found them in the  act of moving all their belongings into a big covered scow or barge  drawn close to the river bank and securely fastened. Cooking utensils,  boxes, bags of provisions consisting of flour, beans and meal, as well  as canned goods of every description, along with firewood and numerous  other things, were dumped in one big heap upon the banks of the Klondyke  River near the barge.    The small sheet iron box with door and lid, called a Yukon stove, had  been set up close in one corner of the living room, which in size was  about eight by ten feet. Two bunks, one above the other in the opposite  corner, had been lately constructed by father, who at the moment of my  arrival was busy screwing a small drop leaf to the wall to be used as a  dining table when supported by a couple of rather uncertain adjustable  legs underneath.    The meaning of all this commotion was not long to find. Father and  brother had, along with many more as peaceable and law-abiding citizens,  been ordered out of their log cabins, built at a great out-lay of time,  money and strength, so that their homes should be pulled down in  accordance with an order given by the Governor. This land, as the city  had grown, had increased in value and was coveted by those high in  authority. No redress was made the settlers, no money was paid them,  nothing for them but insulting commands and black looks from the  Canadian police enforcing the order of the governor.    \"Never again,\" said my father repeatedly, \"will I build or own a home in  the Klondyke. This scow will shelter me until I make what money I want,  and then good-bye to such a country and its oppressive officials.\"    Other men cursed and swore, and mutterings of a serious nature were  heard; but there was nothing to be done, and the row of comfortable,  completed log cabins was torn down, and we settled ourselves elsewhere  by degrees. A bunk with calico curtains hung around it was made for me,  and I was constituted cook of the camp. Then such a scouring of tins,  kettles and pails as I had! Shelves were nailed in place for all such  utensils, and a spot was found for almost everything, after which the  struggle was begun to keep these things in their places. Then I baked  and boiled and stewed and patched and mended, between times writing in  my note book, sending letters to friends or taking kodak pictures.    I was now living in a new world! Nothing like the town of Dawson had I  ever seen. Crooked, rough and dirty streets; rude, narrow board walks or  none at all; dog-teams hauling all manner of loads on small carts, and  donkeys or \"burros\" bowing beneath great loads of supplies starting out  on the trail for the gold mines.    \"Don't do that!\" shouted a man to me one day, as I attempted to  \"snap-shot\" his pack train of twenty horses and mules as they passed us.  Two of the animals had grown tired and attempted to lie down, thus  causing the flour sacks with which they were loaded to burst open and  the flour to fly in clouds around them. \"Don't do that,\" he entreated,  \"for we are having too much trouble!\"    Some of the drivers were lashing the mules to make them rise, and this  spread a panic through most of the train, so that one horse, evidently  new to the business and not of a serious turn of mind, ran swiftly away,  kicking up his heels in the dust behind him. There were also hams and  sides of bacon dangling in greasy yellow covers over the backs of the  pack animals, along with \"grub\" boxes and bags of canned goods of every  description. Pick axes, shovels, gold pans and Yukon stoves with bundles  of stove pipe tied together with ropes, rolls of blankets, bedding,  rubber boots, canvas tents, ad infinitum.    There was one method used by \"packers,\" as the drivers of these pack  trains were called, which worked well in some instances. If the animals  of his train were all sober and given to honestly doing their work, then  the halter or rope around the neck of a mule could be tied to the tail  of the one preceding him, and so on again until they were all really  hitched together tandem. But woe unto the poor brute who was followed by  a balky fellow or a shirk! The consequences were, at times, under  certain circumstances, almost too serious to be recounted in this story,  at least this can be said of the emphatic language used by the packers  in such predicament.    One warm, bright day soon after my arrival in Dawson, and when order had  been brought out of chaos in the scow--our home--I went to call upon an  old friend, formerly of Seattle. Carrie N. was three or four years  younger than myself, had been a nurse for a time after the death of her  husband, but grew tired of that work, and decided in the winter of 1897  and 1898 to go into the Klondyke. A party of forty men and women going  to Dawson was made up in Seattle, and she joined them. For weeks they  were busily engaged in making their preparations. Living near me, as she  did at the time, I was often with Carrie N. and was much interested in  her movements and accompanied her to the Alaska steamer the day she  sailed. It was the little ship \"Alki\" upon which she went away, and it  was crowded with passengers and loaded heavily with freight for the trip  to Dyea, as Skagway and the dreaded White Pass had been voted out of the  plans of the Seattle party of forty.    [Illustration: GOING TO DAWSON IN WINTER.]    Now in Dawson I called upon Carrie N. eighteen months later, and heard  her tell the story of her trip to the Klondyke. They had landed, she  said, at Dyea from the \"Alki\" with their many tons of provisions and  supplies, all of which had to be dumped upon the beach where no dock or  wharf had ever been constructed. Here with dog-teams and sleds, a few  horses and men \"packers,\" their supplies were hauled up the mountain as  far as \"Sheep Camp,\" some ten miles up the mountain side. It was early  springtime and the snow lay deep upon the mountains and in the gorges,  which, in the vicinity of Chilkoot Pass at the summit of the mountain  are frightfully high and precipitous.    The weather was not cold, and the moving of this large party of forty  persons with their entire outfit was progressing as favorably as could  be expected. A camp had been made at Dyea as the base of operations;  another was made at Sheep Camp. At each place the women of the party did  the cooking in tents while men gathered wood, built fires, and brought  water. Other men worked steadily at the hauling, and most of their  supplies had already been transported to the upper camp; when there  occurred a tragedy so frightful as to make itself a part of  never-to-be-forgotten Alaskan history.    It was on Sunday, and a snow storm was raging, but the weather was warm.  Hundreds of people thronged the trails both going up and coming down the  mountain in their effort to quickly transport their outfits over to the  other side, and thus make the best possible time in reaching the gold  fields. Here a difference of opinion arose among the people of our  Seattle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#4)"],[1,"angry. \"I  must get a firebrand and beat them with it,\" he said, \"for they must  learn to be good.\"    So the hares were beaten with the firebrand till their ears were black  as night. Their bodies were still white, but if the spirit hears them  scolding and fighting again, it may be that we shall see their bodies as  black as their ears.          WHY THE MAGPIE'S NEST IS NOT WELL BUILT.      A long time ago all the birds met together to talk about building nests.    \"Every Indian has a wigwam,\" said the robin, \"and every bird needs a  home.\"    \"Indians have no feathers,\" said the owl, \"and so they are cold without  wigwams. We have feathers.\"    \"I keep warm by flying swiftly,\" said the swallow.    \"And I keep warm by fluttering my wings,\" said the humming-bird.    \"By and by we shall have our little ones,\" said the robin. \"They will  have no feathers on their wings, so they cannot fly or flutter; and they  will be cold. How shall we keep them warm if we have no nests?\"    Then all the birds said, \"We will build nests so that our little ones  will be warm.\"    The birds went to work. One brought twigs, one brought moss, and one  brought leaves. They sang together merrily, for they thought of the  little ones that would some time come to live in the warm nests.    Now the magpie was lazy, and she sat still and watched the others at  their work.    \"Come and build your nest in the reeds and rushes,\" cried one bird, but  the magpie said \"No.\"    \"My nest is on the branch of a tree,\" called another, \"and it rocks like  a child's cradle. Come and build beside it,\" but the magpie said \"No.\"    Before long all the birds but the magpie had their nests built. The  magpie cried, \"I do not know how to build a nest. Will you not help me?\"    The other birds were sorry for her and answered, \"We will teach you.\"  The black-bird said, \"Put the twigs on this bough;\" the robin said, \"Put  the leaves between the twigs;\" and the humming-bird said, \"Put this soft  green moss over it all.\"    [Illustration]    \"I do not know how,\" cried the magpie.    \"We are teaching you,\" said the other birds. But the magpie was lazy,  and she thought, \"If I do not learn, they will build a nest for me.\"    The other birds talked together. \"She does not wish to learn,\" they  said, \"and we will not help her any longer.\" So they went away from her.    Then the magpie was sorry. \"Come back,\" she called, \"and I will learn.\"  But by this time the other birds had eggs in their nests, and they were  busy taking care of them, and had no time to teach the lazy magpie. This  is why the magpie's nest is not well built.          WHY THE RAVEN'S FEATHERS ARE BLACK.      Long, long ago the raven's feathers were white as snow. He was a  beautiful bird, but the other birds did not like him because he was a  thief. When they saw him coming, they would hide away the things that  they cared for most, but in some marvelous way he always found them and  took them to his nest in the pine-tree.    One morning the raven heard a little bird singing merrily in a thicket.  The leaves of the trees were dark green, and the little bird's yellow  feathers looked like sunshine among them.    \"I will have that bird,\" said the raven, and he seized the trembling  little thing.    The yellow bird fluttered and cried, \"Help, help! Will no one come and  help me!\"    The other birds happened to be far away, and not one heard her cries.  \"The raven will kill me,\" she called. \"Help, help!\"    Now hidden in the bark of a tree was a wood-worm.    \"I am only a wood-worm,\" he said to himself, \"and I cannot fly like a  bird, but the yellow bird has been good to me, and I will do what I can  to help her.\"    When the sun set, the raven went to sleep. Then the wood-worm made his  way softly up the pine-tree to the raven's nest, and bound his feet  together with grass and pieces of birch-bark.    \"Fly away,\" whispered the wood-worm softly to the little yellow bird,  \"and come to see me by and by. I must teach the raven not to be cruel to  the other birds.\"    The little yellow bird flew away, and the wood-worm brought twigs, and  moss, and birch-bark, and grass, and put them around the tree. Then he  set them all on fire. Up the great pine-tree went the flames, leaping  from bough to bough.    \"Fire! fire!\" cried the raven. \"Come and help me! My nest is on fire!\"    The other birds were not sorry to see him flutter. \"He is a thief,\" said  they. \"Let him be in the fire.\"    By and by the fire burned the grass and the pieces of birch-bark that  fastened his feet together, and the raven flew away. He was not burned,  but he could no longer be proud of his shining white feathers, for the  smoke had made every one of them as black as night.          HOW FIRE WAS BROUGHT TO THE INDIANS.      PART I. SEIZING THE FIREBRAND.    Oh, it was so cold! The wind blew the leaves about on the ground. The  frost spirit hid on the north side of every tree, and stung every animal  of the forest that came near. Then the snow fell till the ground was  white. Through the snowflakes one could see the sun, but the sun looked  cold, for it was not a clear, bright yellow. It was almost as white as  the moon.    The Indians drew their cloaks more and more closely around them, for  they had no fire.    \"How shall we get fire?\" they asked, but no one answered.    All the fire on earth was in the wigwam of two old women who did not  like the Indians.    \"They shall not have it,\" said the old women, and they watched night and  day so that no one could get a firebrand.    At last a young Indian said to the others, \"No man can get fire. Let us  ask the animals to help us.\"    \"What beast or what bird can get fire when the two old women are  watching it?\" the others cried.    \"The bear might get it.\"    \"No, he cannot run swiftly.\"    \"The deer can run.\"    \"His antlers would not go through the door of the wigwam.\"    \"The raven can go through the door.\"    \"It was smoke that made the raven's feathers black, and now he always  keeps away from the fire.\"    \"The serpent has not been in the smoke.\"    \"No, but he is not our friend, and he will not do anything for us.\"    \"Then I will ask the wolf,\" said the young man. \"He can run, he has no  antlers, and he has not been in the smoke.\"    So the young man went to the wolf and called, \"Friend wolf, if you will  get us a firebrand, I will give you some food every day.\"    \"I will get it,\" said the wolf. \"Go to the home of the old women and  hide behind a tree; and when you hear me cough three times, give a loud  war-cry.\"    Close by the village of the Indians was a pond. In the pond was a frog,  and near the pond lived a squirrel, a bat, a bear, and a deer. The wolf  cried, \"Frog, hide in the rushes across the pond. Squirrel, go to the  bushes beside the path that runs from the pond to the wigwam of the two  old women. Bat, go into the shadow and sleep if you like, but do not  close both eyes. Bear, do not stir from behind this great rock till you  are told. Deer, keep still as a mountain till something happens.\"    The wolf then went to the wigwam of the two old women. He coughed at the  door, and at last they said, \"Wolf, you may come in to the fire.\"    [Illustration]    The wolf went into the wigwam. He coughed three times, and the Indian  gave a war-cry. The two old women ran out quickly into the forest to  see what had happened, and the wolf ran away with a firebrand from the  fire.      PART II. THE FIREBRAND IN THE FOREST.    When the two women saw that the wolf had the firebrand, they were very  angry, and straightway they ran after him.    \"Catch it and run!\" cried the wolf, and he threw it to the deer. The  deer caught it and ran.    \"Catch it and run!\" cried the deer, and he threw it to the bear. The  bear caught it and ran.    \"Catch it and fly!\" cried the bear, and he threw it to the bat. The bat  caught it and flew.    \"Catch it and run!\" cried the bat, and he threw it to the squirrel. The  squirrel caught it and ran.    \"Oh, serpent,\" called the two old women, \"you are no friend to the  Indians. Help us. Get the firebrand away from the squirrel.\"    As the squirrel ran swiftly over the ground, the serpent sprang up and  tried to seize the firebrand. He did not get it, but the smoke went into  the squirrel's nostrils and made him cough. He would not let go of the  firebrand, but ran and ran till he could throw it to the frog.    When the frog was running away with it, then the squirrel for the first  time thought of himself, and he found that his beautiful bushy tail was  no longer straight, for the fire had curled it up over his back.    \"Do not be sorry,\" called the young Indian across the pond. \"Whenever an  Indian boy sees a squirrel with his tail curled up over his back, he  will throw him a nut.\"      PART III. THE FIREBRAND IN THE POND.    All this time the firebrand was burning, and the frog was going to the  pond as fast as he could. The old women were running after him, and when  he came to the water, one of them caught him by the tail.    \"I have caught him!\" she called.    \"Do not let him go!\" cried the other.    \"No, I will not,\" said the first; but she did let him go, for the little  frog tore himself away and dived into the water. His tail was still in  the woman's hand, but the firebrand was safe, and he made his way  swiftly across the pond.    \"Here it is,\" said the frog.    \"Where?\" asked the young Indian. Then the frog coughed, and out of his  mouth came the firebrand. It was small, for it had been burning all this  time, but it set fire to the leaves and twigs, and soon the Indians were  warm again. They sang and they danced about the flames.    At first the frog was sad, because he was sorry to lose his tail; but  before long he was as merry as the people who were dancing, for the  young Indian said, \"Little frog, you have been a good friend to us, and  as long as we live on the earth, we will never throw a stone at a frog  that has no"]]]
