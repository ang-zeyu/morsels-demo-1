[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#4)"],[1,", they swim about; but the Mamma elephants do not  do that. Why? Because they have to get busy and bathe their little  children. They call to the children to stop playing, and come and have  a bath--just as our Mammas do.    How do they call? Why, I must tell you at once that all kinds of  animals have _a language of their own_. They do not speak exactly as  we do, but make different sounds through their mouth or nose, and each  sound _means_ something.    If the Mamma elephant wants to say \"Come here,\" she makes one kind of  sound, and the baby elephant has learned to know exactly what that  means. And if the Mamma elephant wants to say \"Keep still,\" she makes  another kind of sound, and the baby knows also what that means.    [Illustration: An Elephant Giving himself a Shower Bath]    In this way all animals can talk among themselves. Of course they  cannot say many things, as we do, but quite enough to tell what they  want.    So each Mamma elephant calls to her child to come and stand on the  bank. Now, many of our children often hate to be bathed; and the  elephant children are just the same! In fact, the very small ones  actually cry and shriek, just like our babies!      _Elephant Child Obeys Mamma--or Gets Spanked_    But when the Mamma elephant calls to the baby to stop playing and come  and stand by the bank, the baby comes at once, even though it hates to  be bathed. The baby elephant obeys its Mamma almost the first time,  whatever she tells it to do.    But if the baby does not obey, does its Mamma spank it? Of course she  does--like all Mammas! The elephant Mamma does the spanking with her  trunk.    But I must tell you at once that an elephant child never gets spanked  more than once in its life--and that is enough! And some are so good  that they _never_ get spanked!    The elephant child learns very quickly to obey its Mamma and Papa, and  afterwards its trainer or teacher. The elephant child even obeys the  very minute it is told to do anything; in fact, sometimes in the  jungle there is a sudden danger, even if the elephant child does not  see the danger. But its Mamma or Papa sees it.    Then the Mamma or Papa calls out to the child to stop, or come away,  or do something, _at once_; and if the child does not do it at once,  it may get killed. Among men folks, if a child runs out into the  street, and an auto or a street car comes suddenly, then if the child  will not obey its Mamma at once and do exactly as she says, the child  may be run over and killed. In the jungle the elephant child also has  sudden dangers like that, though in a different way.    In the next chapter I shall tell you a wonderful story about a boy  elephant who escaped a great danger because he obeyed his Papa at  once.    But sometimes it happens that a boy elephant is really naughty--just  like a bad boy among men. As you know, a bad boy among men usually  grows up to be a bad man, and then he gets into a lot of trouble. In  the elephant herd it is just the same; a bad little elephant grows up  to be a bad big elephant; it is then called a _rogue_. In another book  I shall tell you how the President of the herd orders all the police  elephants to stand in a ring around the rogue and give him a most  awful spanking. And they do that, not with their trunks this time, but  with their _tusks_--which hurt most dreadfully.      _How the Elephant Child is Bathed_    But now I shall tell you about the baby elephant when its Mamma calls  it to come and be bathed. It comes to the edge of the bank, and stands  facing its Mamma. Then the Mamma fills her trunk with water, brings  the trunk quite near the baby, and squirts the water all over it.    The baby may howl and jump about and make faces, but it _never runs  away_! Again and again the Mamma squirts the water, till all the mud  and dust of the jungle is washed away from the baby's body. Then she  tells the baby to play about on the bank again, while she attends to  the bigger children.    What has she got to do to them? She must teach them to swim!    Of course _all animals with four legs know how to swim naturally_;  their bodies float in the water quite easily, and they have only to  work their legs to move along in the water. But with elephants it is a  little different. Why? Just think!    I shall tell you. Although they can float quite naturally, their noses  point downward right into the water. As I said before, the elephant's  trunk is its nose--that is, the elephant has to _breathe through the  trunk_. So of course, if in trying to swim a little elephant kept its  trunk down in the water, it would not be able to breathe at all, and  would die.    That is why the Mamma elephant has to teach her child how to swim  properly. And the way she does it is quite wonderful.    I must first tell you that the trunk is not only like a nose to the  elephant, but also is useful as a _hand_; the elephant can hold a lot  of things with it, and can even pick up with its tip a tiny thing as  small as a pin.      _How the Elephant Child Learns to Swim_    So the Mamma elephant stretches out her trunk before her, just like an  arm, and tells her child to lie across it. In that way she holds up  the child in the water, so that the little elephant has only to think  of curling up the tip of its own little trunk out of the water to  breathe. Then she tells her child to kick out with its legs, so as to  move forward through the water.    But sometimes, in kicking out, the little elephant forgets to hold up  the tip of its trunk out of the water at the same time; then down goes  its trunk into the water, and it cannot breathe!    Then what happens? The Mamma elephant can do nothing, as she is  already using her own trunk to hold up her child. So, what is to be  done?    Really, the elephants are so wise that they take no chances of that  happening. The Papa elephant takes care of that. When he sees that the  Mamma is teaching the little elephant how to swim, he always comes  near them. He may be swimming about, as if he were enjoying himself;  but he is really watching them all the time.    And if the little elephant forgets to hold up its trunk out of the  water, the Papa comes quickly, and with one upward stroke of his own  trunk he lifts up the little elephant's trunk clear out of the water.  Is not that very wise and thoughtful of the Papa elephant?    In that way the little elephant soon learns to do _both_ things--that  is, to kick out with its legs so as to move along, and also to hold up  its trunk to breathe. And then, of course, it can swim properly.    And yet the elephants are so very wise that they never take the risk  of tiring out a little elephant, if they have to swim a very long way.  Sometimes a whole herd of elephants has to swim across a very wide  river. Then the Mamma elephant tells her child to swim in front of  her, while she encourages the child from behind with many fond words.    But sometimes after swimming halfway across the river--    \"Mamma, I am getting tired!\" cries the little one.    \"Then come on my back, darling!\" says the Mamma.    She dives, and comes up right under the little elephant; so now her  child sits on her back. In that way she swims along, and carries her  child across the wide river, as you see in the picture.    [Illustration: An Elephant Mamma Carrying her Child across the River]          CHAPTER IV.    Elephants: The Tricks of the Jungle      Now I shall tell you how a little elephant learns all the tricks of  the jungle from its Mamma and Papa. By the tricks of the jungle I mean  all the things that an animal has to learn in order to get enough to  eat every day, what to do when food is scarce, how to be comfortable  and happy, and also how to escape from every danger; in fact, these  things are very much like what men have to learn, only in a different  way.    But the animal folks are better off in one way: what they have to  learn is not like a lesson in school, but just play. In fact they  learn everything by just playing it as a game! I shall tell you how.    When a baby elephant is quite small, its Mamma has to feed it with  milk. Afterwards, when it has teeth, she teaches it to feed from the  jungle. All elephants eat tender shoots, herbs, and fresh young  leaves; they seize a bough with the trunk, and pull it down in such a  way that the end of the bough reaches right into the mouth.      _Elephant Child Learns to Feed_    First, the Mamma elephant eats like that from several boughs, while  the little elephant watches her do it. Then she looks at a low bough  within easy reach, and says in the elephant language, \"Eat that!\"    The little one looks at the bough, grabs it anyhow with its trunk, and  pulls it down. But it cannot get the end of the bough _into its  mouth_! Instead, the bough pokes it on the forehead, or eyes, or  cheeks.    \"Hold it straight!\" says Mamma, laughing.    The little one tries several times, but still it cannot get the bough  to come right. Then its Mamma puts her own trunk over that of her  child, and turns it to right or left, till the bough comes exactly  into the little elephant's mouth.    \"You must learn to use your trunk just like a _hand_,\" she says. \"So  you must bend your trunk, or turn it, or twist it, to get the thing  you are holding exactly where you want it.\"    And that is the first great thing the little elephant has to  learn--_how to use its trunk as we use our hands_. After that  everything else comes easy.    Now I am going to tell you about the childhood of the most wonderful  elephant in the world, who actually lives to-day in the courtyard of a  palace in India. He is the biggest elephant that ever was; that is why  he lives in a grand palace, and does nothing except carry a King, or  some other great man, on his back on days of festival.    In fact he was the leader among all the elephants in a long procession  at a grand festival called the Durbar, held in honor of the King of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#4)"],[1,"as between a coarse and a fine  sand of one size of grains the coarse sand gives the stronger mortar.  Further data on the effect of size of grains on the utility of sand for  concrete are given in Chapter II, in the section on Voids in Sand, and  for those who wish to study in detail, the test data on this and the  other matters referred to here, the authors recommend \"Cements, Mortars  and Concretes; Their Physical Properties,\" by Myron S. Falk.    ~COST OF SAND.~--A very common price for sand in cities is $1 per cu. yd.,  delivered at the work. It may be noted here that as sand is often sold  by the load instead of the cubic yard, it is wise to have a written  agreement defining the size of a load. Where the contractor gets his  sand from the pit its cost will be the cost of excavating and loading at  the pit, the cost of hauling in wagons, the cost of freight and  rehandling it if necessary, and the cost of washing, added together.    An energetic man working under a good foreman will load 20 cu. yds. of  sand into wagons per 10-hour day; with a poor foreman or when laborers  are scarce, it is not safe to count on more than 15 cu. yds. per day.  With wages at $1.50 per day this will make the cost of loading 10 cts.  per cubic yard. The cost of hauling will include the cost of lost team  time and dumping, which will average about 5 cts. per cubic yard. With 1  cu. yd. loads, wages of team 35 cts. per hour, and speed of travel 2½  miles per hour, the cost of hauling proper is ½ ct. per 100 ft., or 27  cts. per mile. Assuming a mile haul, the cost of sand delivered based on  the above figures will be 10 cts. + 5 cts. + ½ ct. per 100 ft. = 15 +  27 cts. = 42 cts. per cu. yd. Freight rates can always be secured and it  is usually safe to estimate the weight on a basis of 2,700 lbs. per  cubic yard. For a full discussion of the cost of excavating sand and  other earths the reader is referred to \"Earth Excavation and  Embankments; Methods and Cost,\" by Halbert P. Gillette and Daniel J.  Hauer.      ~METHODS AND COST OF WASHING SAND.~--When the available sand carries  considerable percentages of loam or clay and the specifications require  that clean sand shall be used, washing is necessary. The best and  cheapest method of performing this task will depend upon the local  conditions and the amount of sand to be washed.    ~Washing With Hose.~--When the quantity of sand to be washed does not  exceed 15 to 30 cu. yds. per day the simplest method, perhaps, is to use  a hose. Build a wooden tank or box, 8 ft. wide and 15 ft. long, the  bottom having a slope of 8 ins. in the 15 ft. The sides should be about  8 ins. high at the lower end and rise gradually to 3 ft. in height at  the upper end. Close the lower end of the tank with a board gate about 6  ins. in height and sliding in grooves so that it can be removed. Dump  about 3 cu. yds. of sand into the upper end of the tank and play a  ¾-in. hose stream of water on it, the hose man standing at the lower  end of the tank. The water and sand flow down the inclined bottom of the  tank where the sand remains and the dirt flows over the gate and off  with the water. It takes about an hour to wash a 3-cu. yd. batch, and by  building a pair of tanks so that the hose man can shift from one to the  other, washing can proceed continuously and one man will wash 30 cu.  yds. per 10-hour day at a cost, with wages at $1.50, of 5 cts. per cubic  yard. The sand, of course, has to be shoveled from the tank and this  will cost about 10 cts. per cubic yard, making 15 cts. per cubic yard  for washing and shoveling, and to this must be added any extra hauling  and, if the water is pumped, the cost of pumping which may amount to 10  cts. per cubic yard for coal and wages. Altogether a cost of from 15 to  30 cts. per cubic yard may be figured for washing sand with a hose.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Plan and Elevation of Two-Hopper Ejector Sand  Washing Plant.]    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--Plan and Elevation of Four-Hopper Ejector Sand  Washing-Plant.]    ~Washing With Sand Ejectors.~--When large quantities of sand are to be  washed use may be made of the sand ejector system, commonly employed in  washing filter sand at large water filtration plants; water under  pressure is required. In this system the dirty sand is delivered into a  conical or pyramidal hopper, from the bottom of which it is drawn by an  ejector and delivered mixed with water into a second similar hopper;  here the water and dirt overflow the top of the hopper, while the sand  settles and is again ejected into a third hopper or to the stock pile or  bins. The system may consist of anywhere from two to six hoppers. Figure  1 shows a two-hopper lay-out and Fig. 2 shows a four-hopper lay-out. In  the first plant the washed sand is delivered into bins so arranged, as  will be seen, that the bins are virtually a third washing hopper. The  clean sand is chuted from these bins directly into cars or wagons. In  the second plant the clean sand is ejected into a trough which leads it  into buckets handled by a derrick. The details of one of the washing  hoppers for the plant shown by Fig. 1 are illustrated by Fig. 3.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Details of Washing Hopper and Ejector for Plant  Shown by Fig. 1.]    At filter plants the dirty sand is delivered mixed with water to the  first hopper by means of ejectors stationed in the filters and  discharging through pipes to the washers. When, as would usually be the  case in contract work, the sand is delivered comparatively dry to the  first hopper, this hopper must be provided with a sprinkler pipe to wet  the sand. In studying the ejector washing plants illustrated it should  be borne in mind that for concrete work they would not need to be of  such permanent construction as for filter plants, the washers would be  mounted on timber frames, underground piping would be done away with,  etc.; at best, however, such plants are expensive and will be warranted  only when the amount of sand to be washed is large.    The usual assumption of water-works engineers is that the volume of  water required for washing filter sand is 15 times the volume of the  sand washed. At the Albany, N. Y., filters the sand passes through five  ejectors at the rate of 3 to 5 cu. yds. per hour and takes 4,000  gallons of water per cubic yard. One man shovels sand into the washer  and two take it away. Based on an output of 32 cu. yds. in 10 hours, Mr.  Allen Hazen estimates the cost of washing as follows:    3 men, at $2 per day                    $6.00  110,000 gallons of water, at $0.05       5.50                                         ------  Total, 32 cu. yds., at 36 cts.         $11.50    ~Washing With Tank Washers.~--Figure 4 shows a sand washer used in  constructing a concrete lock at Springdale, Pa., in the United States  government improvement work on the Allegheny river. The device consisted  of a circular tank 9 ft. in diameter and 7 ft. high, provided with a  sloping false bottom perforated with 1-in. holes, through which water  was forced as indicated. A 7½×5×6-in. pump with a 3-in. discharge pipe  was used to force water into the tank, and the rotating paddles were  operated by a 7 h.p. engine. This apparatus washed a batch of 14 cu.  yds. in from 1 to 2 hours at a cost of 7 cts. per cubic yard. The sand  contained much fine coal and silt. The above data are given by Mr. W. H.  Roper.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Details of Tank Washer Used at Springdale, Pa.]    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Details of Tank Washer Used at Yonkers, N. Y.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Details of Rotating Tank Sand Washer Used at  Hudson, N. Y.]    Another form of tank washer, designed by Mr. Allen Hazen, for washing  bank sand at Yonkers, N. Y., is shown by Fig. 5. This apparatus  consisted of a 10×2½×2½ ft. wooden box, with a 6-in. pipe entering one  end at the bottom and there branching into three 3-in. pipes, extending  along the bottom and capped at the ends. The undersides of the 3-in.  pipes were pierced with ½-in. holes 6 ins. apart, through which water  under pressure was discharged into the box. Sand was shoveled into the  box at one end and the upward currents of water raised the fine and  dirty particles until they escaped through the waste troughs. When the  box became filled with sand a sliding door at one end was opened and the  batch discharged. The operation was continuous as long as sand was  shoveled into the box; by manipulating the door the sand could be made  to run out with a very small percentage of water. Sand containing 7 per  cent of dirt was thus washed so that it contained only 0.6 per cent  dirt. The washer handled 200 cu. yds. of sand in 10 hours. The above  data are given by F. H. Stephenson.    A somewhat more elaborate form of tank washer than either of those  described is shown by Fig. 6. This apparatus was used by Mr. Geo. A.  Soper for washing filter sand at Hudson, N. Y. The dirty sand was  shoveled into a sort of hopper, from which it was fed by a hose stream  into an inclined cylinder, along which it traveled and was discharged  into a wooden trough provided with a screw conveyor and closed at both  ends. The water overflowing the sides of the trough carried away the  dirt and the clean sand was delivered by the screw to the bucket  elevator which hoisted it to a platform, from which it was taken by  barrows to the stock pile. A 4-h.p. engine with a 5-h.p. boiler operated  the cylinder, screw, elevator and pump. Four men operated the washer and  handled 32 cu. yds. of sand per day; with wages at $1.50 the cost of  washing was 20 cts. per cubic yard.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Arrangement of Sand Washing Plant at Lynchburg,  Va.]    In constructing a concrete block dam at Lynchburg, Va., sand containing  from 15 to 30 per cent. of loam, clay and vegetable matter was washed  to a cleanliness of 2 to 5 per cent of such matter by the device shown  by Fig. 7. A small creek was diverted, "]]]
