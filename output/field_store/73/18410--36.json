Having become possessed of extensive tracts of land on the  border of Otsego Lake, in central New-York, he began the settlement of  his estate there in the autumn of 1785, and in the following spring  erected the first house in Cooperstown. From this time until 1790 Judge  Cooper resided alternately at Cooperstown and Burlington, keeping up an  establishment at both places. James Fenimore Cooper was born at  Burlington on the fifteenth of September, 1789, and in the succeeding  year was carried to the new home of his family, of which he is now  proprietor.    Judge Cooper being a member of the Congress, which then held its  sessions in Philadelphia, his family remained much of the time at  Burlington, where our author, when but six years of age, commenced under  a private tutor of some eminence his classical education. In 1800 he  became an inmate of the family of Rev. Thomas Ellison, Rector of St  Peter's, in Albany, who had fitted for the university three of his elder  brothers, and on the death of that accomplished teacher was sent to New  Haven, where he completed his preparatory studies. He entered Yale  College at the beginning of the second term of 1802. Among his  classmates were John A. Collier, Judge Cushman, and the late Justice  Sutherland of New-York, Judge Bissel of Connecticut, Colonel James  Gadsden of Florida, and several others who afterwards became eminent in  various professions. John C. Calhoun was at the time a resident  graduate, and Judge William Jay of Bedford, who had been his room-mate  at Albany, entered the class below him. The late James A. Hillhouse  originally entered the same class with Mr. Cooper; there was very little  difference in their ages, both having been born in the same month, and  both being much too young to be thrown into the arena of college life.  Hillhouse was judiciously withdrawn for this reason until the succeeding  year, leaving Cooper the youngest student in the college; he, however,  maintained a respectable position, and in the ancient languages  particularly had no superior in his class.    In 1805 he quitted the college, and obtaining a midshipman's warrant,  entered the navy. His frank, generous, and daring nature made him a  favorite, and admirably fitted him for the service, in which he would  unquestionably have obtained the highest honors had he not finally made  choice of the ease and quiet of the life of a private gentleman. After  six years afloat--six years not unprofitably passed, since they gave him  that knowledge of maritime affairs which enabled him subsequently,  almost without an effort, to place himself at the head of all the  writers who in any period have attempted the description of the sea--he  resigned his office, and on the first day of January, 1811, was married  to Miss De Lancey, a sister of the present Bishop of the Diocese of  Western New-York, and a descendant of one of the oldest and most  influential families in America.    Before removing to Cooperstown he resided a short time in Westchester,  near New-York, and here he commenced his career as an author. His first  book was _Precaution_. It was undertaken under circumstances purely  accidental, and published under great disadvantages. Its success was  moderate, though far from contemptible. It is a ludicrous evidence of  the value of critical opinion in this country, that _Precaution_ was  thought to discover so much knowledge of _English_ society, as to raise  a question whether its alleged author could have written it. More  reputation for this sort of knowledge accrued to Mr. Cooper from  _Precaution_ than from his subsequent real work on England. It was  republished in London, and passed for an English novel.    _The Spy_ followed. No one will dispute the success of _The Spy_. It was  almost immediately republished in all parts of Europe. The novelty of an  American book of this character probably contributed to give it  circulation. It is worthy of remark that all our own leading periodicals  looked coldly upon it; though the country did not. The _North American  Review_--ever unwilling to do justice to Mr. Cooper--had a very  ill-natured notice of it, professing to place the _New England Tale_ far  above it! In spite of such shallow criticism, however, the book was  universally popular. It was decidedly the best historical romance then  written by an American; not without faults, indeed, but with a fair  plot, clearly and strongly drawn characters, and exhibiting great  boldness and originality of conception. Its success was perhaps decisive  of Mr. Cooper's career, and it gave an extraordinary impulse to  literature in the country. More than any thing that had before occurred,  it roused the people from their feeling of intellectual dependence. The  popularity of _The Spy_ has been so universal, that there is scarcely a  written language into which it is not translated. In 1847 it appeared in  _Persian_ at Ispahan.    In 1823 appeared _The Pioneers_. This book has passages of masterly  description, and is as fresh as a landscape from another world; but it  seems to me that it has always had a reputation partly factitious. It is  the poorest of the Leather Stocking tales, nor was its success either  marked or spontaneous. Still, it was very well received, though it was  thought to be a proof that the author was written out. With this book  commenced the absurdity of saying Mr. Cooper introduced family traits  and family history into his novels. How little of truth there is in this  supposition Mr. Cooper has explained in his revised edition, published  the present year.    _The Pilot_ succeeded. The success of _The Pilot_ was at first a little  doubtful in this country; but England gave it a reputation which it  still maintains. It is due to Boston to say that its popularity in the  United States was first manifested there. I say _due_ to Boston, not  from considerations of merit in the book, but because, for some reason,  praise for Mr. Cooper, from New England, has been so rare. The _North  American Review_ took credit to itself for magnanimity in saying some of  his works had been rendered into French, when they were a part of every  literature of Europe. America, it is often said, has no original  literature. Where can the model of The Pilot be found? I know of nothing  which could have suggested it but the following fact, which was related  to me in a conversation with Mr. Cooper. The Pirate had been published a  short time before. Talking with the late Charles Wilkes, of New-York--a  man of taste and judgment--our author heard extolled the universal  knowledge of Scott, and the sea portions of The Pirate cited as a proof.  He laughed at the idea, as most seamen would, and the discussion ended  by his promising to write a sea story which could be read by landsmen,  while seamen should feel its truth. The Pilot was the fruit of that  conversation. It is one of the most remarkable novels of the time, and  every where obtained instant and high applause.    _Lionel Lincoln_ followed. This was a second attempt to embody history  in an American work of fiction. It failed, and perhaps justly; yet it  contains one of the nicest delineations of character in Mr. Cooper's  works. I know of no instance in which the distinction between a maniac  and an idiot is so admirably drawn; the setting was bad, however, and  the picture was not examined.    In 1826 came _The Last of the Mohicans_. This book succeeded from the  first, and all over Christendom. It has strong parts and weak parts, but  it was purely original, and originality always occupies the ground. In  this respect it is like The Pilot.    After the publication of The Last of The Mohicans, Mr. Cooper went to  Europe, where his reputation was already well established as one of the  greatest writers of romantic fiction which our age, more prolific in men  of genius than any other, had produced. The first of his works after he  left his native country was _The Prairie_. Its success every where was  decided and immediate. By the French and English critics it has been  deemed the best of his stories of Indian life. It has one leading fault,  however, that of introducing any character superior to the family of the  squatter. Of this fault Mr. Cooper was himself aware before he finished  the work; but as he wrote and printed simultaneously, it was not easy to  correct it. In this book, notwithstanding, Natty Bumpo is quite up to  his mark, and is surpassed only in The Pathfinder. The reputation of The  Prairie, like that of The Pioneers, is in a large degree owing to the  opinions of the reviews; it is always a fault in a book that appeals to  human sympathies, that it fails with the multitude. In what relates to  taste, the multitude is of no great authority; but in all that is  connected with feeling, they are the highest; and for this simple  reason, that as man becomes sophisticated he deviates from nature, the  only true source of all our sympathies. Our feelings are doubtless  improved by refinement, and vice versa; but their roots are struck in  the human heart, and what fails to touch the heart, in these  particulars, fails, while that which does touch it, succeeds. The  perfection of this sort of writing is that which pleases equally the  head and the heart.    _The Red Rover_ followed The Prairie. Its success surpassed that of any  of its predecessors. It was written and printed in Paris, and all in a  few months. Its merits and its reception prove the accuracy of those  gentlemen who allege that \"Mr. Cooper never wrote a successful book  after he left the United States.\" It is certainly a stronger work than  The Pilot, though not without considerable faults.    _The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish_ was the next novel. The author I believe  regards this and Lionel Lincoln as the poorest of his works. It met with  no great success.    _The Water Witch_ succeeded, but is inferior to any of the other  nautical tales. It "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25341"],[0,"The 28th: A Record of War Service in the Australian Imperial Force, 1915-19, (#4)"],[1,"an early response, with the result that  across the Indian Ocean was maintained a steady stream of troops during  the whole two and a half years of operations.    Western Australia readily took up a share of the burden and played her  small, though not unimportant, part. Her contribution in troops  consisted of 64 officers and 1,167 other ranks, together with 1,179  horses. On a population basis this effort was greater than that of any  of the other Australian States. In casualties the various units (one  infantry and nine mounted infantry) suffered a loss of 40 by death and  86 by wounds. That the services rendered were valuable, worthy of the  State, and highly creditable to the individuals, may be gathered from  the fact that the following honours were awarded: 1 V.C., 2 C.B.'s, 7  D.S.O.'s, 8 D.C.M.'s, and 3 additional Mentions in Despatches.    When Europe burst into the flame and smoke of war in August, 1914,  Australia was unified in Government and a nation in sentiment--but  still a British nation. Her offers of assistance had been expected and  were graciously and gratefully accepted. The Western Australians once  more responded and, this time, in their thousands. Again the quota was  exceeded--reinforcements being supplied even for Eastern States'  units--and in all some 32,028 soldiers and nurses enlisted for service  overseas during the period of 1914-1918.[A] Over 6,000 of these laid  down their lives for Australia and the Empire, and many thousands more  were wounded and maimed.    The 28th Battalion was one of three battalions wholly recruited and  organised in Western Australia. It did not take the field in time to  participate in the earlier days on Gallipoli, but showed its mettle in  many a subsequent hard fight. Its deeds, and those of the other units  which left these western shores, gained the unstinted admiration of the  remainder of the Australian Imperial Force and constitute no mean  record.    The contingents for South Africa were trained on the military reserve at  Karrakatta. There there was a rifle range and sufficient space for the  exercise of small bodies of troops. When, in 1914, it became obvious  that larger numbers would be involved, a search was made for a greater  and better camp site and training area. Eventually this was found at  Blackboy Hill, which is situated about a mile east of Bellevue and quite  close to the Eastern Railway. This area had been used by the Citizen  Forces during the annual training of that year and found very suitable  for dismounted work. The camp site is a rounded knoll of some few acres  in extent, possessing the advantages of good natural drainage, a liberal  number of shady trees, and firm soil underfoot. The surrounding country  is broken by the foothills of the Darling Range and intersected by  roads, fences, and--here and there--small watercourses. However,  sufficient level ground is available to suit ordinary purposes and,  altogether, the locality lends itself admirably to the training of  infantry in platoons.    Here, then, when the first attested men were called up, were pitched the  tents and marquees to shelter the troops. At the outset conditions of  life were rough. The limited trained staff available, and the absence of  many of the services recognised as essential in order to make military  administration efficient, harassed the newcomers and caused a waste of  time, together with considerable dislocation in the training. Later on,  under successive camp commandants, conditions much improved. Efficient  services were installed and competent men were trained to work them.  Eventually Blackboy Camp came to be known throughout Australia as one of  the most complete and comfortable.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: BLACKBOY HILL CAMP.  _Photos. lent by Mr. E. L. Mitchell, Perth._]    The camp was rapidly filled and, as units moved out, filled again.  Before the end of February, 1915, there had proceeded overseas the 10th  Regiment of Light Horse, the 8th Battery of Field Artillery, the 11th  Battalion, the major portion of the 16th Battalion, and one company of  the 12th Battalion; together with various technical and administrative  units and detachments.    Recruits continued to pour in, and the men forthcoming were more than  sufficient to supply the reinforcing drafts which were sent forward  monthly. During February the Australian Government decided to raise  further Light Horse Regiments and the 5th and 6th Brigades of Infantry.  The 5th Brigade was to be furnished by New South Wales with one  battalion (20th) from Queensland. Victoria was to supply the 6th  Brigade, with two companies each from South and Western Australia to  form the 24th Battalion.    The two companies (\"C\" and \"D\") of the 24th Battalion were immediately  formed from the depot units in camp and commenced to equip and train.    Hardly had this been done when Headquarters announced the raising of  even another brigade of infantry--the 7th. On the 1st April the  establishments for this were issued. One and a half battalions (25th and  26th) were to be supplied by Queensland; half a battalion (26th) by  Tasmania; and one battalion each by South Australia (27th) and Western  Australia (28th). Added to this was a brigade staff of five officers and  21 other ranks to be raised from all districts. This new proposal  necessitated some re-arrangement in respect to the 5th and 6th Brigades.  The responsibility for the 20th Battalion reverted to New South Wales.  Victoria likewise undertook to provide sufficient men for the 24th  Battalion.    The Commandant of Western Australia, therefore, found himself called  upon to raise and equip a complete new unit consisting of 32 officers,  994 other ranks, and 63 horses, together with two machine guns, nine  bicycles, and 13 transport vehicles.[B]    On the 16th April definite instructions were issued to the Officer  Commanding at Blackboy Camp to organise the new battalion from the  troops then under canvas. Action was immediately taken, and what were  formerly \"C\" and \"D\" Companies of the 24th Battalion became \"A\" and \"B\"  Companies of the 28th. Two new companies were formed from the depot  units, and the whole four were then moved to separate lines and placed  under the temporary command of Captain L. B. Welch, who had 2nd Lieut.  C. H. Lamb to assist him as Adjutant. Other officers from the depot  helped in the organisation and administration.    [Illustration: SOME OF THE ORIGINAL OFFICERS.  _Photo. lent by Mr. E. L. Mitchell, Perth._]    On the 23rd April Lieutenant-Colonel H. B. Collett was appointed to the  command. This officer had formerly commanded the 11th Australian  Infantry Regiment and the 88th Infantry Battalion (both of the Citizen  Forces) in Perth, and had had considerable experience in military  training, administration, and organisation. His first consideration was  the selection and appointment of officers and non-commissioned officers,  and the formation of the specialist detachments which were to be an  integral and important part of the Battalion.    In the selection of officers little discretionary power was allowed the  Commanding Officer. A Selection Board, appointed by the Minister for  Defence, and sitting at Perth, recommended appointments. Very often this  was done without a full knowledge of the candidate or of his  qualifications. Under such circumstances some friction was bound to  occur between the Board and the Commanding Officer. Eventually, however,  it was possible, by means of compromise and adjustment, to gather  together a reasonably sound team of officers. Major C. R. Davies, an  officer of the 84th (Goldfields) Infantry, and a barrister of Boulder,  became Second-in-Command. Captains A. W. Leane, L. B. Welch, and J. A.  C. Wilson were promoted to the rank of Major and appointed to companies.  A fifth major--F. R. Jeffrey--was transferred from Victoria and took \"B\"  Company. This last-named officer, like the Second-in-Command, had seen  service in South Africa, and had recently returned from England, whither  he had conducted a draft of Imperial Reservists. A number of junior  officers were found from the N.C.Os. attending a school of instruction  for candidates for commissions. In the following years most of these men  did exceedingly well. One of them commanded the Battalion during the  major portion of 1917.    The selection and appointment of non-commissioned officers was a process  of a different kind. With a large body of men unused to military  formations and methods, the urgent need was to find other men who had  had some slight experience and could teach the raw material routine and  system and show it its place in the ranks. It did not, however, follow,  that the same men, with their slight experience, were so equipped  mentally and physically as to render them efficient leaders and  commanders in the field. Another factor to be borne in mind was that  from the ranks of the N.C.Os. would, in the future, be drawn the men to  fill the gaps caused by casualties in the commissioned ranks. The  qualities expected of an officer were personality, moral as well as  physical courage, education, health, and a sporting disposition. The  education sought was not necessarily academic, but such as indicated a  capacity for rapid thought and for expression in speech and writing,  together with a knowledge of men and their ways.[C] A high standard was  thus set, and this being considered, all wearers of stripes were deemed  to hold their rank temporarily--confirmation being dependent on their  acquiring efficiency and displaying the desired qualifications. This  method of appointment held good until after the Battalion's arrival in  Egypt, and resulted in the collection of a most admirable body of  subordinate leaders. Many of these same N.C.Os.--as officers--afterwards  earned great distinction for themselves and for the unit. They were  indeed the \"backbone of the army.\"  "]]]
