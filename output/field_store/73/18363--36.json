His temper, he truly said, was prone to lenity; but his duty  to he community forced him to be, in this one instance, severe. He  declared that, in his judgment, Pagans who had never heard the name  of Christ, and who were guided only by the light of nature, were more  trustworthy members of civil society than men who had been formed in the  schools of the Popish casuists. [7] Locke, in the celebrated treatise in  which he laboured to show that even the grossest forms of idolatry ought  not to be prohibited under penal sanctions, contended that the Church  which taught men not to keep faith with heretics had no claim to  toleration. [8]    It is evident that, in such circumstances, the greatest service which an  English Roman Catholic could render to his brethren in the faith was  to convince the public that, whatever some rash men might, in times of  violent excitement, have written or done, his Church did not hold that  any end could sanctify means inconsistent with morality. And this great  service it was in the power of James to render. He was King. He was more  powerful than any English King had been within the memory of the oldest  man. It depended on him whether the reproach which lay on his religion  should be taken away or should be made permanent.    Had he conformed to the laws, had he fulfilled his promises, had he  abstained from employing any unrighteous methods for the propagation of  his own theological tenets, had he suspended the operation of the penal  statutes by a large exercise of his unquestionable prerogative of mercy,  but, at the same time, carefully abstained from violating the civil or  ecclesiastical constitution of the realm, the feeling of his people must  have undergone a rapid change. So conspicuous an example of good faith  punctiliously observed by a Popish prince towards a Protestant nation  would have quieted the public apprehensions. Men who saw that a  Roman Catholic might safely be suffered to direct the whole executive  administration, to command the army and navy, to convoke and dissolve  the legislature, to appoint the Bishops and Deans of the Church of  England, would soon have ceased to fear that any great evil would arise  from allowing a Roman Catholic to be captain of a company or alderman  of a borough. It is probable that, in a few years, the sect so long  detested by the nation would, with general applause, have been admitted  to office and to Parliament.    If, on the other hand, James should attempt to promote the interest  of his Church by violating the fundamental laws of his kingdom and the  solemn promises which he had repeatedly made in the face of the whole  world, it could hardly be doubted that the charges which it had been the  fashion to bring against the Roman Catholic religion would be considered  by all Protestants as fully established. For, if ever a Roman Catholic  could be expected to keep faith with heretics, James might have been  expected to keep faith with the Anglican clergy. To them he owed his  crown. But for their strenuous opposition to the Exclusion Bill he  would have been a banished man. He had repeatedly and emphatically  acknowledged his obligation to them, and had vowed to maintain them in  all their legal rights. If he could not be bound by ties like these, it  must be evident that, where his superstition was concerned, no tie of  gratitude or of honour could bind him. To trust him would thenceforth be  impossible; and, if his people could not trust him, what member of his  Church could they trust? He was not supposed to be constitutionally  or habitually treacherous. To his blunt manner, and to his want  of consideration for the feelings of others, he owed a much higher  reputation for sincerity than he at all deserved. His eulogists affected  to call him James the Just. If then it should appear that, in turning  Papist, he had also turned dissembler and promisebreaker, what  conclusion was likely to be drawn by a nation already disposed to  believe that Popery had a pernicious influence on the moral character?    On these grounds many of the most eminent Roman Catholics of that age,  and among them the Supreme Pontiff, were of opinion that the interest  of their Church in our island would be most effectually promoted by a  moderate and constitutional policy. But such reasoning had no effect on  the slow understanding and imperious temper of James. In his eagerness  to remove the disabilities under which the professors of his religion  lay, he took a course which convinced the most enlightened and tolerant  Protestants of his time that those disabilities were essential to the  safety of the state. To his policy the English Roman Catholics owed  three years of lawless and insolent triumph, and a hundred and forty  years of subjection and degradation.    Many members of his Church held commissions in the newly raised  regiments. This breach of the law for a time passed uncensured: for men  were not disposed to note every irregularity which was committed by  a King suddenly called upon to defend his crown and his life against  rebels. But the danger was now over. The insurgents had been vanquished  and punished. Their unsuccessful attempt had strengthened the government  which they had hoped to overthrow. Yet still James continued to grant  commissions to unqualified persons; and speedily it was announced that  he was determined to be no longer bound by the Test Act, that he hoped  to induce the Parliament to repeal that Act, but that, if the Parliament  proved refractory, he would not the less have his own way.    As soon as this was known, a deep murmur, the forerunner of a tempest,  gave him warning that the spirit before which his grandfather, his  father, and his brother had been compelled to recede, though dormant,  was not extinct. Opposition appeared first in the cabinet. Halifax did  not attempt to conceal his disgust and alarm. At the Council board  he courageously gave utterance to those feelings which, as it soon  appeared, pervaded the whole nation. None of his colleagues seconded  him; and the subject dropped. He was summoned to the royal closet, and  had two long conferences with his master. James tried the effect of  compliments and blandishments, but to no purpose. Halifax positively  refused to promise that he would give his vote in the House of Lords for  the repeal either of the Test Act or of the Habeas Corpus Act.    Some of those who were about the King advised him not, on the eve of  the meeting of Parliament, to drive the most eloquent and accomplished  statesman of the age into opposition. They represented that Halifax  loved the dignity and emoluments of office, that, while he continued to  be Lord President, it would be hardly possible for him to put forth his  whole strength against the government, and that to dismiss him from  his high post was to emancipate him from all restraint. The King was  peremptory. Halifax was informed that his services were no longer  needed; and his name was struck out of the Council-Book. [9]    His dismission produced a great sensation not only in England, but also  at Paris, at Vienna, and at the Hague: for it was well known, that he  had always laboured to counteract the influence exercised by the court  of Versailles on English affairs. Lewis expressed great pleasure at the  news. The ministers of the United Provinces and of the House of Austria,  on the other hand, extolled the wisdom and virtue of the discarded  statesman in a manner which gave great offence at Whitehall. James was  particularly angry with the secretary of the imperial legation, who did  not scruple to say that the eminent service which Halifax had performed  in the debate on the Exclusion Bill had been requited with gross  ingratitude. [10]    It soon became clear that Halifax would have many followers. A portion  of the Tories, with their old leader, Danby, at their head, began to  hold Whiggish language. Even the prelates hinted that there was a  point at which the loyalty due to the prince must yield to higher  considerations. The discontent of the chiefs of the army was still more  extraordinary and still more formidable. Already began to appear the  first symptoms of that feeling which, three years later, impelled so  many officers of high rank to desert the royal standard. Men who had  never before had a scruple had on a sudden become strangely scrupulous.  Churchill gently whispered that the King was going too far. Kirke, just  returned from his western butchery, swore to stand by the Protestant  religion. Even if he abjured the faith in which he had been bred, he  would never, he said, become a Papist. He was already bespoken. If ever  he did apostatize, he was bound by a solemn promise to the Emperor of  Morocco to turn Mussulman. [11]    While the nation, agitated by many strong emotions, looked anxiously  forward to the reassembling of the Houses, tidings, which increased the  prevailing excitement, arrived from France.    The long and heroic struggle which the Huguenots had maintained against  the French government had been brought to a final close by the ability  and vigour of Richelieu. That great statesman vanquished them; but he  confirmed to them the liberty of conscience which had been bestowed on  them by the edict of Nantes. They were suffered, under some restraints  of no galling kind, to worship God according to their own ritual, and  to write in defence of their own doctrine. They were admissible to  political and military employment; nor did their heresy, during a  considerable time, practically impede their rise in the world.

Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the  faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look  for. By a man's finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his  trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his  expression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling  is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the  competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\"    \"What ineffable twaddle!\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the  table, \"I never read such rubbish in my life.\"    \"What is it?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.    \"Why, this article,\" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat  down to my breakfast. \"I see that you have read it since you have marked  it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It  is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these  neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not  practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class  carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his  fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\"    \"You would lose your money,\" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \"As for  the article I wrote it myself.\"    \"You!\"    \"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The  theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so  chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend  upon them for my bread and cheese.\"    \"And how?\" I asked involuntarily.    \"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the  world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.  Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private  ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to  put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I  am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of  crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about  misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger  ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade  is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a  forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\"    \"And these other people?\"    \"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are  all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little  enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and  then I pocket my fee.\"    \"But do you mean to say,\" I said, \"that without leaving your room you  can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they  have seen every detail for themselves?\"    \"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case  turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and  see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge  which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.  Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your  scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is  second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our  first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\"    \"You were told, no doubt.\"    \"Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long  habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I  arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.  There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a  gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly  an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is  dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are  fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says  clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and  unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have  seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The  whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you  came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\"    \"It is simple enough as you explain it,\" I said, smiling. \"You remind  me of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did  exist outside of stories.\"    Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \"No doubt you think that you are  complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\" he observed. \"Now, in my  opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking  in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of  an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some  analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as  Poe appeared to imagine.\"    \"Have you read Gaboriau's works?\" I asked. \"Does Lecoq come up to your  idea of a detective?\"    Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \"Lecoq was a miserable bungler,\"  he said, in an angry voice; \"he had only one thing to recommend him, and  that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was  how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four  hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for  detectives to teach them what to avoid.\"    I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired  treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood  looking out into the busy street. \"This fellow may be very clever,\" I  said to myself, \"but he is certainly very conceited.\"    \"There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\" he said,  querulously. \"What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know  well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has  ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural  talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the  result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy  with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see  through it.\"    I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it  best to change the topic.    \"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?\" I asked, pointing to a  stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the  other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had  a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a  message.    \"You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\" said Sherlock Holmes.    \"Brag and bounce!\" thought I to myself. \"He knows that I cannot verify  his guess.\"    The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were  watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across  the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps  ascending the stair.    \"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" he said, stepping into the room and handing  my friend the letter.    Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little  thought of this when he made that random shot. \"May I ask, my lad,\" I  said, in the blandest voice, \"what your trade may be?\"    \"Commissionaire, sir,\" he said, gruffly. \"Uniform away for repairs.\"    \"And you were?\" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my  companion.    \"A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,  sir.\"    He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was  gone.          CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY [6]      I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the  practical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his powers  of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking  suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged  episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have  in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he  had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,  lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.    \"How in the world did you deduce that?\" I asked.    \"Deduce what?\" said he, petulantly.    \"Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\"    \"I have no time for trifles,\" he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,  \"Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps  it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a  sergeant of Marines?\"    \"No, indeed.\"    \"It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you  were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some  difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the  street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the  fellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,  however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was  a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.  You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung  his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of  him--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\"    \"Wonderful!\" I ejaculated.    \"Commonplace,\" said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he  was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \"I said just now that  there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!\" He  threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought. [7]    \"Why,\" I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \"this is terrible!\"    \"It does seem to be a little out of the common,\" he remarked, calmly.  \"Would you mind reading it to me aloud?\"    This is the letter which I read to him----      \"MY DEAR MR."]]]
