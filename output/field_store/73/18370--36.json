Now Abdul Karim was only a laborer on the land, receiving no wages,  merely being paid in grain and cloth sufficient for the wants of  himself and family. Of money he knew nothing except by name.    One day his master was so pleased with his work that he actually gave  him ten \"krans,\" equivalent to about a dollar of our money. To Abdul  Karim this seemed great wealth, and directly his day's work was done,  he ran home to his wife and said: \"Look, Zeeba, there's riches for  you!\" and spread out the money before her. His good wife was delighted,  and so were the children.    Then Abdul Karim said: \"How shall we spend this great sum? The master  has also given me a day's holiday, so if you don't mind, I will go to  the famous city of Meshed, which is only twenty miles from here, and  after placing two krans on the shrine of the holy Imam, I will then  visit the bazaars and buy everything you and the children desire.\"    \"You would better buy me a piece of silk for a new dress,\" said Zeeba.    \"I want a fine horse and a sword,\" said little Yusuf.    \"I would like an Indian handkerchief and a pair of gold slippers,\" said  Fatima.    \"They shall be here by to-morrow night,\" said the father, and taking a  big stick, he set off on his journey.    When he had come down from the mountains to the plain below, Abdul  Karim saw stretched before him the glorious city, and was lost in  wonder at the sight of the splendid domes, where roofs glittered with  gold, and the minarets, from the tops of which the priests were calling  the people to prayer.    Then coming to the gate of the shrine, he asked an old priest if he  might enter. \"Yes, my son,\" was the reply. \"Go in and give what thou  canst spare to the mosque, and Allah will reward thee.\"    So Abdul Karim walked through the great court, amidst worshipers from  every city in Asia. With open-mouthed astonishment he gazed on the  riches of the temple, the jewels, the lovely carpets, the silks, the  golden ornaments, and with humility he placed his two pieces of money  on the sacred tomb. Then through the noise and bustle of the crowded  streets, he went until he found the bazaars.    He found the sellers of fruits in one place, in another those who sold  pots and pans, then he came to the jewelers, the bakers, the butchers,  each trade having its own part of the bazaar, and so on, until he  reached that part where there were only those who sold silks.    He entered one of the shops and asked to see some silks, and after much  picking and choosing, fixed upon a superb piece of purple silk with an  embroidered border of exquisite design. \"I will take this,\" he said.  \"What is the price?\"    \"I shall only ask you two hundred krans, as you are a new customer,\"  said the shopkeeper. \"Anybody else but you would have to pay three or  four hundred.\"    \"Two hundred krans,\" repeated Abdul Karim, in astonishment. \"Surely you  have made a mistake. Do you mean krans like these?\" taking one out of  his pocket.    \"Certainly I do,\" replied the shopkeeper, \"and let me tell you it is  very cheap at that price.\"    Abdul Karim pictured the disappointment of his wife. \"Poor Zeeba,\" he  sighed.    \"Poor who?\" said the silk merchant.    \"My wife,\" said Abdul Karim.    \"What have I to do with your wife?\" asked the merchant, getting angry  because he saw that all his trouble was in vain.    \"I will tell you about it,\" said Abdul Karim. \"Because I did my work  well, my master gave me ten krans, the first time I ever have had any  money. After giving two krans to the shrine, I intended to buy a piece  of silk for my wife, a horse and sword for my little boy Yusuf, and an  Indian handkerchief and a pair of gold slippers for my little girl  Fatima. And here you ask me two hundred krans for one piece of silk.  How can I pay you and buy the other things?\"    \"Here I have been wasting my time and rumpling my beautiful silks for a  fool like you,\" cried the angry merchant. \"Get out of my shop! Go home  to your stupid Zeeba and your stupid children. Buy them some stale  cakes and some black sugar, and don't put your head in my shop again,  or it will be worse for you.\"    Then he took off his slipper, and with many blows drove poor Abdul  Karim out into the street. Then Abdul Karim went to the horse market,  only to find that the lowest-priced horse would cost two hundred and  fifty krans.    The horse dealer mocked him when they found he had only eight krans,  and suggested that he buy the sixteenth part of a donkey for his little  son. As for a sword, he found that it would cost at least thirty krans;  while a pair of golden slippers would run into many hundreds of krans;  and for an Indian handkerchief, the price was twelve krans.    As poor Abdul Karim bent his weary way home, he met a beggar crying:  \"Dear friend, give me something, for to-morrow is Friday\"--the  Mahommedan Sunday. \"He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord,  and of a certainty the Lord will pay him back a hundredfold.\"    \"Of all the men I have met to-day, you are the only one with whom I can  deal,\" said simple Abdul Karim. \"Here are eight krans. Use them in the  service of God, and don't forget to pay me back a hundredfold.\"    Wrapping up the eight krans very carefully, the cunning beggar promised  some day to return them a hundredfold.    At last Abdul Karim came in sight of his cottage, and little Yusuf, who  had been all day on the look-out for him, ran breathlessly to meet him.  \"Where's my horse and sword, father?\" he cried. And Fatima, who had  just come up, called out, \"And my handkerchief and golden slippers?\"  And Zeeba asked for her bit of silk.    Poor Abdul Karim looked so confused, that his wife said: \"Be quiet, my  dears. Your father could not bring them all with him, so he has packed  them on Yusuf's horse and left him in charge of a servant, who will be  here presently.\" But when she heard his story, and above all that he  had given eight krans to a beggar, she got very angry, and marched off  and told the master.    But the master was still more angry, and said: \"What! the blockhead  gave his eight krans to a beggar? Send him to me.\" And when Abdul Karim  came before him, he said scornfully: \"You must fancy yourself a big  man, Abdul. I never give more than a copper coin to a beggar, but your  Excellency gives them silver. The beggar promised that you should be  repaid a hundredfold, did he? And it shall be so, even now.\" Then as  Abdul's face brightened, he laughed and said: \"Not in money, but in  stripes.\" And his servants threw Abdul on the ground and gave him one  hundred blows on his bare feet.    The next day, Abdul's master sent for him again, and after calling him  a fool, said: \"I have a nice little job for you, that will bring you to  your proper senses. Go into the field and dig for water, day after day  until you find it.\"    So for many days Abdul labored under the scorching sun, until he had  dug down to a depth of about thirty feet, and then he came upon a brass  vessel, finely chased, full of round white stones, which fairly dazzled  his eyes in the fierce sunlight. He put one in his mouth and tried to  break it with his teeth, but could not.    Then he said to himself, \"The master has planted some rice and it has  turned into stones. Perhaps there are some more.\" And going down a few  feet lower, he found another pot filled with sparkling stones of  various colors.    Then he remembered that he had seen pretty pieces of glass like these  for sale in Meshed, and made up his mind that on the first opportunity  he would again visit the city and take the stones with him. Meanwhile,  he would hide them, and say nothing.    Abdul did not have to wait long for a holiday, for on finding water a  little lower down, his master was so pleased that he gave him a  well-deserved rest, and then Abdul set off for Meshed. But before  entering the city, he hid most of the treasure at the foot of a tree  under a big stone. Then with still a pocket full, he went straight to  the shop where he had seen such stones, and spoke to the shopkeeper who  was seated at the entrance to his shop, calmly smoking his water-pipe.    \"Do you want to buy any more stones like those?\" he asked, pointing to  some in a brass tray. \"Yes, have you got one?\" replied the merchant,  for Abdul did not look like a man who was likely to have more than one,  if any.    \"I have a pocket full of them,\" said Abdul.    \"You have a pocket full of pebbles, more likely,\" said the jeweler. But  when Abdul took out a handful and showed him, he was so astonished that  he could hardly speak. Trembling in every limb, he bade Abdul wait a  minute, and leaving his apprentice in charge, he hastily left the shop.  When he returned, the chief of the police was with him.    \"I am innocent,\" cried the jeweler. \"There is the man. His pockets are  filled with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and pearls of great price.  Without doubt he has found the long-lost treasure of Cyrus.\"    Then Abdul was searched; the precious stones were found upon him; and  when they had brought Zeeba and the children, the whole family were  sent under a guard of five hundred soldiers to the capital.    While all these things were taking place, the King saw in his dreams,  for three nights, one after the other, the Holy Prophet, who, looking  steadfastly at him, exclaimed: \"Abbas, protect and favor my friend.\"  And on the third night, the King took courage and said to the Prophet:  \"And who is thy friend?\" And the answer came:    \"He is a poor laboring man, Abdul Karim by name, who of his poverty  gave one-fifth to the shrine at Meshed, and now, because he has found  the King's treasure, they have bound him, and are bringing him to this  city to oppress him.\"    So the King went forth two days' journey to meet Abdul. First came one  hundred horsemen. Next, poor Abdul, seated on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#4)"],[1,"the  unlimited liability of master for servant which was worked out on  the Continent, both by the German tribes and at Rome. Whether the  principle when established was an indigenous growth, or whether  the last step was taken under the influence of the Roman law, of  which Bracton made great use, I cannot say. It is enough that the  soil was ready for it, and that it took root at an early day. /1/  This is all that need be said here with regard to the liability  of a master for the misdeeds of his servants.    It is next to be shown what became of the principle as applied to  animals. Nowadays a man is bound at his peril to keep his cattle  from trespassing, and he is liable for damage done by his dog or  by any fierce animal, if he has notice of a tendency in the brute  to do the harm complained of. The question is whether any  connection can be established between these very sensible and  intelligible rules of modern law and the surrender directed by  King Alfred.    Let us turn to one of the old books of the Scotch law, where the  old principle still appears in full force and is stated with its  reasons as then understood, /2/    \"Gif ane wylde or head-strang horse, carries ane man [21] against  his will over an craig, or heuch, or to the water, and the man  happin to drowne, the horse sall perteine to the king as escheit.    \"Bot it is otherwise of ane tame and dantoned horse; gif any man  fulishlie rides, and be sharp spurres compelles his horse to take  the water, and the man drownes, the horse sould not be escheit,  for that comes be the mans fault or trespasse, and not of the  horse, and the man has receaved his punishment, in sa farre as he  is perished and dead; and the horse quha did na fault, sould not  be escheit.    \"The like reason is of all other beastes, quhilk slayes anie man,  [it is added in a later work, \"of the quhilk slaughter they haue  gilt,\"] for all these beasts sould be escheit.\" /1/    \"The Forme and Maner of Baron Courts\" continues as follows:--    \"It is to witt, that this question is asked in the law, Gif ane  lord hes ane milne, and any man fall in the damne, and be borne  down with the water quhill he comes to the quheill, and there be  slaine to death with the quheill; quhither aught the milne to be  eseheir or not? The law sayes thereto nay, and be this reason,  For it is ane dead thing, and ane dead thing may do na fellony,  nor be made escheit throw their gilt. Swa the milne in this case  is not culpable, and in the law it is lawfull to the lord of the  land to haue ane mylne on his awin water quhere best likes him.\"  /2/    The reader will see in this passage, as has been remarked already  of the Roman law, that a distinction is taken between things  which are capable of guilt and those which [22] are not,--between  living and dead things; but he will also see that no difficulty  was felt in treating animals as guilty.    Take next an early passage of the English law, a report of what  was laid down by one of the English judges. In 1333 it was stated  for law, that, \"if my dog kills your sheep, and I, freshly after  the fact, tender you the dog, you are without recovery against  me.\" /1/ More than three centuries later, in 1676, it was said  by Twisden, J. that, \"if one hath kept a tame fox, which gets  loose and grows wild, he that hath kept him before shall not  answer for the damage the fox doth after he hath lost him, and he  hath resumed his wild nature.\" /2/ It is at least doubtful  whether that sentence ever would have been written but for the  lingering influence of the notion that the ground of the owner's  liability was his ownership of the offending: thing and his  failure to surrender it. When the fox escaped, by another  principle of law the ownership was at an end. In fact, that very  consideration was seriously pressed in England as late as 1846,  with regard to a monkey which escaped and bit the plaintiff, /3/  So it seems to be a reasonable conjecture, that it was this way  of thinking which led Lord Holt, near the beginning of the last  century, to intimate that one ground on which a man is bound at  his peril to restrain cattle from trespassing is that he has  valuable property in such animals, whereas he has not dogs, for  which his responsibility is less. /4/ To this day, in fact,  cautious judges state the law as to cattle to be, that, \"if I am  the owner of an animal in which by law the [23] right of property  can exist, I am bound to take care that it does not stray into  the land of my neighbor.\" /1/    I do not mean that our modern law on this subject is only a  survival, and that the only change from primitive notions was to  substitute the owner for the offending animal. For although it is  probable that the early law was one of the causes which led to  the modern doctrine, there has been too much good sense in every  stage of our law to adopt any such sweeping consequences as would  follow from the wholesale transfer of liability supposed. An  owner is not bound at his peril to keep his cattle from harming  his neighbor's person. /2/ And in some of the earliest instances  of personal liability, even for trespass on a neighbor's land,  the ground seems to have been the owner's negligence. /3/    It is the nature of those animals which the common law recognizes  as the subject of ownership to stray, and when straying to do  damage by trampling down and eating crops. At the same time it is  usual and easy to restrain them. On the other hand, a dog, which  is not the subject of property, does no harm by simply crossing  the land of others than its owner. Hence to this extent the new  law might have followed the old. The right of property in the  [24] offending animal, which was the ancient ground of  responsibility, might have been adopted safely enough as the test  of a liability based on the fault of the owner. But the  responsibility for damage of a kind not to be expected from such  animals is determined on grounds of policy comparatively little  disturbed by tradition. The development of personal liability for  fierce wild animals at Rome has been explained. Our law seems to  have followed the Roman.    We will now follow the history of that branch of the primitive  notion which was least likely to survive,--the liability of  inanimate things.    It will be remembered that King Alfred ordained the surrender of  a tree, but that the later Scotch law refused it because a dead  thing could not have guilt. It will be remembered, also, that the  animals which the Scotch law forfeited were escheat to the king.  The same thing has remained true in England until well into this  century, with regard even to inanimate objects. As long ago as  Bracton, /1/ in case a man was slain, the coroner was to value  the object causing the death, and that was to be forfeited sa  deodand \"pro rege.\" It was to be given to God, that is to say to  the Church, for the king, to be expended for the good of his  soul. A man's death had ceased to be the private affair of his  friends as in the time of the barbarian folk-laws. The king, who  furnished the court, now sued for the penalty. He supplanted the  family in the claim on the guilty thing, and the Church  supplanted him.    In Edward the First's time some of the cases remind of the  barbarian laws at their rudest stage. If a man fell from a tree,  the tree was deodand. /2/ If he drowned in a [25] well, the well  was to be filled up. /1/ It did not matter that the forfeited  instrument belonged to an innocent person. \"Where a man killeth  another with the sword of John at Stile, the sword shall be  forfeit as deodand, and yet no default is in the owner.\" /2/ That  is from a book written in the reign of Henry VIII., about 1530.  And it has been repeated from Queen Elizabeth's time /3/ to  within one hundred years, /4/ that if my horse strikes a man, and  afterwards I sell my horse, and after that the man dies, the  horse shall be forfeited. Hence it is, that, in all indictments  for homicide, until very lately it has been necessary to state  the instrument causing the death and its value, as that the  stroke was given by a certain penknife, value sixpence, so as to  secure the forfeiture. It is said that a steam-engine has been  forfeited in this way.    I now come to what I regard as the most remarkable transformation  of this principle, and one which is a most important factor in  our law as it is today. I must for the moment leave the common  law and take up the doctrines of the Admiralty. In the early  books which have just been referred to, and long afterwards, the  fact of motion is adverted to as of much importance. A maxim of  Henry Spigurnel, a judge in the time of Edward I., is reported,  that \"where a man is killed by a cart, or by the fall of a house,  or in other like manner, and the thing in motion is the cause of  the death, it shall be deodand.\" /5/ So it was [26] said in the  next reign that \"oinne illud quod mover cum eo quod occidit  homines deodandum domino Regi erit, vel feodo clerici.\" /1/ The  reader sees how motion gives life to the object forfeited.    The most striking example of this sort is a ship. And accordingly  the old books say that, if a man falls from a ship and is  drowned, the motion of the ship must be taken to cause the death,  and the ship is forfeited,--provided, however, that this  happens in fresh water. /2/ For if the death took place on the  high seas, that was outside the ordinary jurisdiction. This  proviso has been supposed to mean that ships at sea were not  forfeited; /3/ but there is a long series of petitions to the  king in Parliament that such forfeitures may be done away with,  which tell a different story. /4/ The truth seems to be that the  forfeiture took place, but in a different court. A manuscript of  the reign of Henry VI., only recently printed, discloses the fact  that, if a man was killed or drowned at sea by the motion of the  ship, the vessel"]]]
