About six of these  buttons will be sufficient to hold the top in place. The other method is  to bore a hole slanting on the inside of the rails, directing the bit  toward the top, which will make a seat--if not cut too deep--for a screw  that can be turned direct into the top.    The glue must be removed from about the joints and the surfaces smoothed  over with fine sandpaper before applying the stain. The directions for  staining will be found on the can in which it is sold. The grain of the  wood will show up well if the surface is given a dull waxed finish after  staining.          AN UMBRELLA STAND      [Illustration]    The umbrella stand shown in the accompanying illustration will be found  quite appropriate for the hall or reception room that is furnished in  mission style. It can be made of any of the furniture woods, but  quarter-sawed oak gives the best results. The stock necessary to make  this stand can be secured from the mill ready cut to length, squared and  sanded, and is given in the following list:      4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 28 in., S-4-S.    4 top rails, 7/8 by 2 by 10 in., S-2-S.    4 lower rails, 7/8 by 3 by 10 in., S-2-S.    4 slats, 3/8 by 3 by 20 in., S-2-S.    1 bottom, 7/8 by 10 by 10 in.    First square up the posts and bevel the tops as shown in the detail  sketch. Place them side by side, on a flat surface with the ends square  and lay out the mortises with a try-square on all four pieces at the  same time. This will insure your getting them all straight and of the  same height. Now lay out the tenons on the rails in the same manner and  cut them to fit the mortises in the posts. Mortises should also be cut  in the rails for the ends of the side slats as shown. Try all the joints  and see that they fit tight and square. Glue two sides of the stand  together and let them dry for at least 24 hours, then glue the remaining  parts, being careful to get everything together perfectly square.    The bottom board can now be fitted in place. It should have a hole cut  in it for the drip pan. The pan should be about 6 or 7 in. in diameter.  One suitable for the purpose can be purchased in any hardware store. The  bottom board can be fastened to the rails with nails driven from the  under side, or cleats can be nailed to the rails for it to rest upon.    [Illustration]    When the stand is complete, scrape all glue from about the joints and go  over the whole with fine sandpaper, removing all rough spots. Apply the  finish you like best, or the one that will match your other furniture.    Should the builder want an entire hand-made stand, the drip pan may be  beaten into shape from sheet brass or copper. This kind of work is known  as repousse. After beating the pan into shape, it can be finished in  antique, old copper or given a polished surface, as desired.          A CHAFING-DISH BUFFET      The chafing-dish buffet is something very convenient and attractive for  the dining room. For the best effect it should be made of quartered oak,  stained brown or weathered and trimmed with brass hardware.    [Illustration: Buffet in Quartered Oak]    To save a great deal of uninteresting labor, secure the following pieces  of stock, surfaced on four sides and cut to length:      4 legs, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 36 in., S-4-S.    4 rails, 7/8 by 4 by 10 in., S-4-S.    2 rails, 7/8 by 3 by 10 in., S-4-S.    2 panels, 3/8 by 9-3/8 by 9-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 panel, 3/8 by 6-1/2 by 9-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 shelves, 7/8 by 12 by 19 in., S-4-S.    1 top, 7/8 by 16 by 20 in., S-4-S.    2 stiles for door, 7/8 by 2 by 12 in., S-4-S.    2 rails for door, 7/8 by 3 by 10 in., S-4-S.    1 back, 7/8 by 12 by 13 in., S-4-S.    8 slats, 3/8 by 1 by 8 in., S-4-S.    Begin the work on the rails for the sides of the stand. Have them all  squared up to exactly the same length and to the correct width and  thickness. Mark the tenons on the ends of each and cut them with a saw  and chisel.    When this is finished, try the legs to see that they are all the same  length and that their surfaces are square with each other. Next mark the  mortises in the legs for the tenons of the rails. To make the mortises,  first bore to depth with a bit 1/8 in, smaller than the width of the  mortise and cut to the line with a chisel.    [Illustration: Method of Fastening with Screws]    Before gluing up the sides, cut the mortises in two lower rails for the  tenons on the ends of the shelves. These tenons, with the smaller  mortises in them for the keys, should be cut first. Square up the two  side panels and cut grooves 3/8 in. wide and 1/4 in. deep for them in  the rails and part of the legs.    Make the eight slats 8 in. long, 1 in. wide and 3/8 in. thick, and cut  mortises for them in the two upper rails.    [Illustration: Detail of the Chafing-Dish Buffet]    The two sides of the buffet are now ready to be glued up and clamped.  While the glue on these is setting, make the door. The rails are  mortised into the stiles 1/2 in. and both are grooved to receive the  panel. It is best to get the stock a little full for the door so that it  may be made up a little larger than necessary and planed down to fit.    There only remains to fit in the shelves and fasten the top and back.  The top and back are held with screws as shown in sketch.    Taper the keys only slightly, otherwise they will keep working loose.    Stain with two coats of weathered oak, give one coat of thin shellac to  fix the stain and two coats of wax for a soft-gloss finish.          A WRITING DESK      The desk shown in the illustration was made of plain-sawed white oak.  The copper lighting fixtures were made by the amateur as were the hinges  and the drawer pulls. The doors are fitted with art-glass panels. The  following stock list is needed:      1 top, 3/4 by 22-1/2 by 41 in., S-2-S.    4 posts, 2 by 2 by 31 in., S-4-S.    2 rails, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 19 in., S-2-S.    2 rails, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 35 in., S-2-S.    2 rails, 3/4 by 3-1/4 by 19 in., S-2-S.    1 stretcher, 3/4 by 3-1/4 by 35 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 14 in., S-2-S.    4 drawer sides, 1/2 by 4-1/4 by 19 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer backs, 3/8 by 4 by 14 in., S-2-S.    2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 19 by 14 in., S-2-S.    4 slides, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 19 in., S-2-S.    8 guides, 3/4 by 2 by 10 in., S-2-S.    2 cabinet posts, 1 by 1 by 16 in., S-4-S.    4 cabinet posts, 1 by 1 by 11 in., S-4-S.    1 back, 3/4 by 16 by 35 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 8 by 35 in., S-2-S.    2 shelves, 3/4 by 8 by 15 in., S-2-S.    4 door pieces, 5/8 by 1 by 15 in., S-2-S.    8 door pieces, 5/8 by 1 by 4 in., S-2-S.    Square the legs to length and lay out and cut the mortises thereon. Lay  off the tenons on the rails, after having squared the rails to length  and width, and cut them.    Work up the top of the table and then the drawer stock and cabinet.  Assemble the ends of the frame first, using good hot glue and enough  clamps to hold the parts together properly. After the glue has hardened  on these, the clamps may be removed and the front, back rails and the  stretcher assembled.    [Illustration: Writing Desk Made of Plain-Sawed Oak]    While the glue is hardening on the main frame the top cabinet may be  built and assembled. This cabinet is detachable from the table proper  and is to be held in place by means of cleats upon the back. These  cleats are not specified in the bill; they may be obtained from scrap  stock.    [Illustration: Detail of the Writing Desk]    For a piece of woodwork of this style some of the softer browns of the  mission stains will be most appropriate. After all parts have been  thoroughly cleaned by scraping and sandpapering, a stain may be applied.  Allow this to dry, then sand it lightly and apply a thin coat of  shellac. Sand the shellac lightly and apply a filler of a color to match  the stain, but darker in tone, of course. Clean off the surplus in the  usual manner and then apply a coat of shellac. Sand this lightly and  apply several coats of some good polishing wax.          MUSIC RACK AND BOOKSTAND      The illustration shows a very handy music and bookstand, which also can  be used at the bedside as a reading stand. The following list of  material will be required for construction:      1 standard, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 37 in., S-4-S.    1 horizontal, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 15 in., S-4-S.    1 crosspiece, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 14 in., S-4-S.    1 crosspiece, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 12 in., S-4-S.    2 braces, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 9 in., S-4-S.    1 board, 1/2 by 8 by 13 in., S-2-S.    4 blocks, 1-1/8 in. square.    2 gauge clamps.    1 strip, 1/2 by 1 by 13 in., S-2-S.    8 round-head brass screws.    1 brass rod, 1/4 in. in diameter and 12 in, long.    1 brass piece, 1/4 by 3/4 by 10 in.    [Illustration: Complete Stand]    Cut a tenon on the lower end of the upright and make a mortise in the  center of the long crosspiece to receive the tenon. The horizontal has  tenons cut on both ends which fit into mortises cut in the sides of both  crosspieces. The upper corners on the ends of both crosspieces are cut  sloping on a 45-deg. angle. The blocks for the feet are attached to the  under side and at the end on each crosspiece with screws and hot glue,  the screw heads being sunk so that they will not catch on carpets or mar  the floor. The braces are attached with round-head screws after they  are cut on each end to fit the standard and crosspiece.    [Illustration: Detail of the Stand]    The book rest is cut from the board. The openings are made by sawing the  pieces out with a coping saw, and the edges are dressed up with a sharp  chisel. The lip strip is then glued to the lower edge of the board.    One end of the board is now fitted into a slot cut in one of the gauge  clamps. The slot must be cut at the right angle to give the desired  slope to the book rest. The gauge clamps are joined with two small  square"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#4)"],[1,"for a few days  of the most riotous honeymoon in some small pond, where it sings a loud  chorus till mated, lays a few hundred eggs, to be hatched into tadpoles,  then backs itself into its underground world by means of the boring  machine on its hind feet, to be heard no more that season, and seen no  more, unless some one chance to dig it out, just as Hans in the story  dug out the mole-gnome.    In the fairy tale the Shepherd-boy was rewarded by the gnome for digging  him out; for he received both gold and precious stones. But our gnome  does not wish us to dig him out; nevertheless, if you do, you will be  rewarded with a golden fact, and a glimpse of two wonderful jewel eyes.    According to one who knows him well, the Cat's-eye buries itself far  underground, and sleeps days, or weeks, _perhaps years_ at a time. Once  a grave-digger found a Cat's-eye three feet two inches down in the earth  with no way out.    How and when are we then to find this strange creature? Only during his  noisy honeymoon in April.    Do you know the soft trilling whistle of the common Hoptoad in May? The  call of the Cat's-eye is of the same style but very loud and harsh, and  heard early in April. If on some warm night in springtime, you hear a  song which sounds like a cross between a Toad's whistle and a Chicken's  squawk, get a searchlight and go quietly to the place. The light will  help you to come close, and in the water up to his chin, you will see  him, his gold-stone eyes blazing like jewels and his throat blown out  like a mammoth pearl, each time he utters the \"squawk\" which he intends  for a song. And it is a song, and a very successful one, for a visit to  the same pond a week or two later, will show you--not the Cat's-eye or  his mate, they have gone a-tunnelling--but a swarm of little black  pin-like tadpole Cat's-eyes, born and bred in the glorious sunlight but  doomed and ready, if they live, to follow in their parents' tracks far  underground. Sure proof that the song did win a mate, and was crowned  with the success for which all woodland, and marshland song first was  made.      TALE 5    How the Bluebird Came    Nana-bo-jou, that some think is the Indian name for El Sol and some say  is Mother Carey, was sleeping his winter's sleep in the big island just  above the thunder-dam that men call Niagara. Four moons had waned, but  still he slept. The frost draperies of his couch were gone; his white  blanket was burnt into holes. He turned over a little; then the ice on  the river cracked like near-by thunder. When he turned again, it began  to slip over the big beaver-dam of Niagara, but still he did not awake.    [Illustration: How the Bluebird Came]    The great Er-Beaver in his pond, that men call Lake Erie, flapped his  tail, and the waves rolled away to the shore, and set the ice heaving,  cracking, and groaning; but Nana-bo-jou slept on.    Then the Ice-demons pounded the shore of the island with their clubs.  They pushed back the whole river-flood till the channel was dry, then  let it rush down like the end of all things, and they shouted together:    \"Nana-bo-jou! Nana-bo-jou! Nana-bo-jou! Wake up!\"    But still he slept calmly on.    Then came a soft, sweet voice, more gentle than the mating turtle of  Miami. It was in the air, but it was nowhere, and yet it was in the  trees, in the water, and it was in Nana-bo-jou too. He felt it, and it  awoke him. He sat up and looked about. His white blanket was gone; only  a few tatters of it were to be seen in the shady places. In the sunny  spots the shreds of the fringe with its beads had taken root and were  growing into little flowers with beady eyes, Spring Beauties as they are  called now. The small voice kept crying: \"Awake! the spring is coming!\"    Nana-bo-jou said: \"Little voice, where are you? Come here.\"    But the little voice, being everywhere, was nowhere, and could not come  at the hero's call.    So he said: \"Little voice, you are nowhere because you have no place to  live in; I will make you a home.\"    So Nana-bo-jou took a curl of birch bark and made a little wigwam, and  because the voice came from the skies he painted the wigwam with blue  mud, and to show that it came from the Sunland he painted a red sun on  it. On the floor he spread a scrap of his own white blanket, then for a  fire he breathed into it a spark of life, and said: \"Here, little voice,  is your wigwam.\" The little voice entered and took possession, but  Nana-bo-jou had breathed the spark of life into it. The smoke-vent wings  began to move and to flap, and the little wigwam turned into a beautiful  Bluebird with a red sun on its breast and a shirt of white. Away it  flew, but every year it comes as winter wanes, the Bluebird of the  spring. The voice still dwells in it, and we feel that it has lost  nothing of its earliest power when we hear it cry: \"Awake! the spring is  coming!\"      TALE 6    Robin, the Bird that Loves to Make Clay Pots    Everyone knows the Robin; his reddish-brown breast, gray back, white  throat, and dark wings and tail are easily remembered. If you colour the  drawing, you will always remember it afterward. The Robin comes about  our houses and lawns; it lets us get close enough to see it. It has a  loud, sweet song. All birds have a song[A]; and all sing when they are  happy. As they sing most of the time, except when they are asleep, or  when moulting, they must have a lot of happiness in their lives.    Here are some things to remember about the Robin. It is one of the  earliest of all our birds to get up in the morning, and it begins to  sing long before there is daylight.    Birds that live in the trees, _hop_; birds that live on the ground,  _walk_ or _run_; but the Robin lives partly in the trees and partly on  the ground, so sometimes he hops and sometimes he runs.    [Illustration: The Robin Making Clay Pots]    When he alights on a fence or tree, he looks at you and flashes the  white spots on the outer corners of his tail. Again and again he does  this. Why? That is his way of letting you know that he is a Robin. He is  saying in signal code--flash and wig-wag--\"I'm a Robin, I'm a Robin, I'm  a Robin.\" So you will not mistake him for some bird that is less loved.    The Robin invented pottery before men did; his nest is always a clay pot  set in a little pile of straws. Sometime, get a Robin's nest after the  bird is done with it; dry it well, put it on the fire very gently; leave  it till all the straws are burned away, and then if it does not go to  pieces, you will find you have a pretty good earthen pot.    The Robin loves to make these pots. I have known a cock Robin make  several which he did not need, just for the fun of making them.    A friend of mine said to me once, \"Come, and I will show you the nest of  a crazy Robin.\" We went to the woodshed and there on a beam were six  perfectly good Robin nests all in a row; all of them empty.    \"There,\" said my friend. \"All of these six were built by a cock Robin in  about ten days or two weeks. He seemed to do nothing but sing and build  nests. Then after finishing the last one, he disappeared. Wasn't he  crazy?\"    \"No,\" I said, \"not at all. He was not crazy; he was industrious. Let me  finish the chapter. The hen Robin was sitting on the eggs, the cock bird  had nothing else to do, so he put in the time at the two things he did  the best and loved the most: singing and nest-building. Then after the  young were hatched in the home nest, he had plenty to do caring for  them, so he ceased both building and singing, for that season.\"    I have often heard of such things. Indeed, they are rather common, but  not often noticed, because the Robin does not often build all the extra  nests in one place.    Do you know the lovely shade called Robin's-egg blue? The next time you  see a Robin's nest with eggs in it you will understand why it was so  named and feel for a moment, when first you see it, that you have found  a casket full of most exquisite jewels.    Next to nest-building, singing is the Robin's gift, and the songs that  he sings are full of joy. He says, \"_cheerup, cheer up, cheerily  cheer-up_\"; and he means it too.      TALE 7    Brook Brownie, or How the Song Sparrow Got His Streaks    [Illustration: Brook Brownie]      His Mother was the Brook and his sisters were the Reeds,    They, every one, applauded when he sang about his deeds.    His vest was white, his mantle brown, as clear as they could be,    And his songs were fairly bubbling o'er with melody and glee.    But an envious Neighbour splashed with mud our Brownie's coat and vest,    And then a final handful threw that stuck upon his breast.    The Brook-bird's mother did her best to wash the stains away;    But there they stuck, and, as it seems, are very like to stay.    And so he wears the splashes and the mud blotch, as you see;    But his songs are bubbling over still with melody and glee.      TALE 8    Diablo and the Dogwood      [Illustration: The Dogwood Bloom]    What a glorious thing is the Maytime Dogwood in our woods! How it does  sing out its song! More loudly and clearly it sings than any other  spring flower! For it is not one, but a great chorus; and I know it is  singing that \"The spring, the very spring is in the land!\"    I suppose if one had King Solomon's fayland ears, one might hear the  Dogwood music like a lot of church bells pealing, like the chorus of the  cathedral where Woodthrush is the preacher-priest and the Veeries make  responses.    It was Adam's favourite tree, they say, in the Garden of Eden. And it  grew so high, flowered so wonderfully, and gave so much pleasure that  Diablo, who is also called the Devil, wanted to kill it. He made up his  mind that he would blight and scatter every shining leaf of its snowy  bloom. So one dark night he climbed a Honey Locust tree near the gate,  and swung by his tail over the wall, intending to tear off all the  lovely blossoms. But he "]]]
