In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump  into the vats and press the grapes with their feet.    The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left  standing in a warm place.    Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth. The juice  is all in motion.    [Illustration: _Picking grapes and making wine._]    If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice to make jelly, she would  say: \"Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is  spoiled.\"      WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE?    The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is  turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in  the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air. The alcohol is  a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice.    The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place.    This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of it will harm any one who  drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker.    Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to  alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the alcohol.      WINE.    This changed grape-juice is called wine. It is partly water, partly  alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it.    Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very  much the same way as from grapes.    People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own  gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put  any in.    But you know that the alcohol is made in the fruit-juice itself by the  change of the sugar into alcohol and the gas.    [Illustration]    It is the nature of alcohol to make the person who takes a little of it,  in wine, or any other drink, want more and more alcohol. When one goes  on, thus taking more and more of the drinks that contain alcohol, he is  called a drunkard.    In this way wine has made many drunkards. Alcohol hurts both the body  and mind. It changes the person who drinks it. It will make a good and  kind person cruel and bad; and will make a bad person worse.    Every one who takes wine does not become a drunkard, but you are not  sure that you will not, if you drink it.    You should not drink wine, because there is alcohol in it.      CIDER.    Cider is made from apples. In a few hours after the juice is pressed out  of the apples, if it is left open to the air the sugar begins to change.    Like the sugar in the grape, it changes into alcohol and bubbles of gas.    At first, there is but little alcohol in cider, but a little of this  poison is dangerous.    More alcohol is all the time forming until in ten cups of cider there  may be one cup of alcohol. Cider often makes its drinkers ill-tempered  and cross.    Cider and wine will turn into vinegar if left in a warm place long  enough.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. What two things are in all fruit-juices?              2.

[Illustration: A]LCOHOL is often made from grains as well as from fruit.  The grain has starch instead of sugar.    If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into  sugar, you would think it a very strange thing.    Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are  changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think  nothing about it.      STARCH AND SUGAR.    All kinds of grain are full of starch.    If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm,  they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth,  and little stems up into the sunshine.    These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise  way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed  begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar.    [Illustration]    If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one  after, you could tell by the taste that this is true.    Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer.    He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his  grain.    Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to  be quickly dug up again.    He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop  the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed  the root and stem. This sprouted grain is called malt.    The brewer soaks it in plenty of water, because the grain has not water  in itself, as the grape has.    He puts in some yeast to help start the work of changing the sugar into  gas[B] and alcohol.    Sometimes hops are also put in, to give it a bitter taste.    The brewer watches to see the bubbles of gas that tell, as plainly as  words could, that sugar is going and alcohol is coming.    When the work is finished, the barley has been made into beer.    It might have been ground and made into barley-cakes, or into pearl  barley to thicken our soups, and then it would have been good food. Now,  it is a drink containing alcohol, and alcohol is a poison.    You should not drink beer, because there is alcohol in it.    Two boys of the same age begin school together. One of them drinks  wine, cider, and beer. The other never allows these drinks to pass his  lips. These boys soon become very different from each other, because one  is poisoning his body and mind with alcohol, and the other is not.    A man wants a good, steady boy to work for him. Which of these two do  you think he will select? A few years later, a young man is wanted who  can be trusted with the care of an engine or a bank. It is a good  chance. Which of these young men will be more likely to get it?      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. Is there sugar in grain?              2. What is in the grain that can be turned into            sugar?              3. What can you do to a seed that will make its            starch turn into sugar?              4. What does the brewer do to the barley to make            its starch turn into sugar?              5. What is malt?              6. What does the brewer put into the malt to start            the working?              7. What gives the bitter taste to beer?              8. How does the brewer know when sugar begins to            go and alcohol to come?              9. Why does he want the starch turned to sugar?              10.

FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote B: Car bon'ic acid gas.]          CHAPTER VI.    DISTILLING.      [Illustration: D]ISTILLING (d[)i]s t[)i]l[\\l]'ing) may be a new word to  you, but you can easily learn its meaning.    You have all seen distilling going on in the kitchen at home, many a  time. When the water in the tea-kettle is boiling, what comes out at the  nose? Steam.    What is steam?    You can find out what it is by catching some of it on a cold plate, or  tin cover. As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of  water.    When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back  into water, we have distilled the water. We say vapor instead of steam,  when we talk about the boiling of alcohol.    It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to  steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol,  and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first,  and then water.    But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because  it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times  to be pure.    But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is  a little more alcohol and a little less water.    In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine,  cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley.    The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them.

The Master of Golden Pool      One shore of the pool was a spacious sweeping curve of the sward,  dotted with clumps of blue flag-flowers. From the green fringes of  this shore the bottom sloped away softly over a sand so deep and  glowing in its hue of orange-yellow as to give the pool the rich name  by which it was known for miles up and down the hurrying Clearwater.  The other shore was a high, overhanging bank, from whose top drooped a  varied leafage of birch, ash, poplar, and hemlock. Under this bank the  water was deep and dark, a translucent black with trembling streaks  and glints of amber. Fifty yards up-stream a low fall roared  musically; but before reaching the fresh tranquillity of the pool, the  current bore no signs of its disturbance save a few softly whirling  foam clusters. Light airs, perfumed with birch and balsam and warm  scents of the sun-steeped sward, drew over the pool from time to time,  wrinkling and clouding its glassy surface. Birds flew over it,  catching the small flies to whom its sheen was a ceaseless lure. And  huge dragon-flies, with long, iridescent bodies and great jewelled,  sinister eyes, danced and darted above it.    The cool black depths under the bank retained their coolness through  the fiercest heats of summer, because just here the brook was joined  by the waters of an icy spring stealing down through a crevice of the  rocks; and here in the deepest recess, exacting toll of all the varied  life that passed his domain, the master of Golden Pool made his home.    For several years the great trout had held his post in the pool,  defying every lure of the crafty fisherman. The Clearwater was a  protected stream, being leased to a rich fishing club; and the master  of the pool was therefore secure against the treacherous assaults of  net or dynamite. Many times each season fishermen would come and pit  their skill against his cunning; but never a fly could tempt him,  never a silvery, trolled minnow or whirling spoon deceive him to the  fatal rush. At some new lure he would rise lazily once in awhile,  revealing his bulk to the ambitious angler,--but never to take hold.  Contemptuously he would flout the cheat with his broad flukes, and go  down again with a grand swirl to his lair under the rock.    It was only to the outside world--to the dragon-fly, and the bird, and  the chattering red squirrel in the overhanging hemlock--that the deep  water under the bank looked black. To the trout in his lair, looking  upward toward the sunlight, the whole pool had a golden glow. His  favourite position was a narrow place between two stones, where he lay  with head up-stream and belly about two inches from the sandy bottom,  gently fanning the water with his party-coloured fins, and opening and  closing his rosy gill-fringes as he breathed. In length he was  something over twenty inches, with a thick, deep body tapering finely  to the powerful tail. Like all the trout of the Clearwater, he was  silver-bellied with a light pink flush, the yellow and brown markings  on his sides light in tone, and his spots of the most high, intense  vermilion. His great lower jaw was thrust forward in a way that gave a  kind of bulldog ferocity to his expression.    The sky of the big trout's world was the flat surface of Golden Pool.  From the unknown place beyond that sky there came to his eyes but  moving shadows, arrangements of light and dark. He could not see out  and through into the air unobstructedly, as one looks forth from a  window into the world. Most of these moving shadows he understood very  well. When broad and vague, they did not, as a rule, greatly interest  him; but when they got small, and sharply black, he knew they might at  any instant break through with a splash and become real, coloured  things, probably good to eat. A certain slim little shadow was always  of interest to him unless he was feeling gorged. Experience had taught  him that when it actually touched the shining surface above, and lay  there sprawling helplessly with wet wings, it would prove to be a May  fly, which he liked. Having no rivals to get ahead of him, there was  no need of haste. He would sail up with dignity, open his great jaws,  and take in the tiny morsel.    Sometimes the moving shadows were large and of a slower motion, and  these, if they chanced to break through, would prove to be  bright-coloured moths or butterflies, or glittering beetles, or fat  black and yellow bumblebees, or lean black and yellow wasps. If he was  hungry, all these things were good for food, and his bony,  many-toothed mouth cared nothing for stings. Sometimes when he was not  at all hungry, but merely playful, he would rise with a rush at  anything breaking the sheen of his roof, slap it with his tail, then  seize it between his hard lips and carry it down with him, only to  drop it a moment later as a child might drop a toy. Once in awhile,  either in hunger or in sport, he would rise swiftly at the claws or  wing-tips of a dipping swallow; but he never managed to catch the  nimble bird. Had he, by any chance, succeeded, he would probably have  found the feathers no obstacle to his enjoyment of the novel fare.    At times it was not a shadow, but a splash, that would attract his  attention to the shining roof of his world. A grasshopper would fall  in, and kick grotesquely till he rose to end its troubles. Or a  misguided frog, pursued perhaps by some enemy on land, would dive in  and swim by with long, webbed toes. At this sight the master of the  pool would dart from his lair like a bolt from a catapult. Frogs were  much to his taste. And once in a long time even a wood-mouse, hard  pressed and panic-stricken, would leap in to swim across to the meadow  shore. The first time this occurred the trout had risen slowly, and  followed below the swimmer till assured that there was no peril  concealed in the tempting phenomenon. After that, however, he always  went at such prey with a ferocious rush, hurling himself half out of  water in his eagerness.    But it was not only to his translucent sky that the master of the  pool looked for his meat. A large part of it came down upon the  current of the brook. Bugs, grubs, and worms, of land and water, some  dead, others disabled or bewildered by their passage through the  falls, contributed to his feasting. Above all, there were the smaller  fish who were so reckless or uninformed as to try to pass through  Golden Pool. They might be chub, or suckers, or red-fin; they might  be--and more often were--kith and kin of his own. It was all the same  to the big trout, who knew as well as any gourmet that trout were  royal fare. His wide jaws and capacious gullet were big enough to  accommodate a cousin a full third of his own size, if swallowed  properly, head first. His speed was so great that any smaller fish  which he pursued was doomed, unless fortunate enough to be within  instant reach of shoal water. Of course, it must not be imagined that  the great trout was able to keep his domain quite inviolate. When he  was full fed, or sulking, then the finny wanderers passed up and down  freely,--always, however, giving wide berth to the lair under the  bank. In the bright shallows over against the other shore, the  scurrying shoals of pin-fish played safely in the sun. Once in a long  while a fish would pass, up or down, so big that the master of the  pool was willing to let him go unchallenged. And sometimes a muskrat,  swimming with powerful strokes of his hind legs, his tiny forepaws  gathered childishly under his chin, would take his way over the pool  to the meadow of the blue flag-flowers. The master of the pool would  turn up a fierce eye, and watch the swimmer's progress breaking the  golden surface into long, parabolic ripples; but he was too wise to  court a trial of the muskrat's long, chisel-like teeth.    [Illustration: \"THEY MIGHT BE--AND MORE OFTEN WERE--KITH AND KIN OF  HIS OWN.\"]    There were two occasions, never to be effaced from his sluggish  memory, on which the master of the pool had been temporarily routed  from his mastership and driven in a panic from his domain. Of these  the less important had seemed to him by far the more appalling.    Once, on a summer noonday, when the pool was all of a quiver with  golden light, and he lay with slow-waving fins close to the coldest  up-gushing of the spring which cooled his lair, the shining roof of  his realm had been shattered and upheaved with a tremendous splash. A  long, whitish body, many times his own length, had plunged in and  dived almost to the bottom. This creature swam with wide-sprawling  limbs, like a frog, beating the water, and leaping, and uttering  strange sounds; and the disturbance of its antics was a very  cataclysm to the utmost corners of the pool. The trout had not stayed  to investigate the horrifying phenomenon, but had darted madly  down-stream for half a mile, through fall and eddy, rapid and shallow,  to pause at last, with throbbing sides and panting gills, in a little  black pool behind a tree root. Not till hours after the man had  finished his bath, and put on his clothes, and strode away whistling  up the shore, did the big trout venture back to his stronghold. He  found it already occupied by a smaller trout, whom he fell upon and  devoured, to the assuaging of his appetite and the salving of his  wounded dignity. But for days he was tremulously watchful, and ready  to dart away if any unusually large shadow passed over his amber  ceiling. He was expecting a return of the great, white, sprawling  visitor.    His second experience was one which he remembered with cunning  wariness rather than with actual terror. Yet this had been a real  peril, one of the gravest with which he could be confronted in the  guarded precincts of Golden "]]]
