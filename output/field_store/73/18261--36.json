The Moors had shown the  way, and the Corsairs needed little bidding to follow it.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] See S. Lane-Poole, _The Story of the Moors in Spain_, 232-280.    [2] Algiers is in Arabic, Al-Gezair (\"the Islands\"), said to be so  called from that in its bay; or, more probably, Al-Gezair is a  grammarian's explanation of the name Tzeyr or Tzier, by which the  Algerians commonly called their city, and which is, I suspect, a  corruption of the Roman city _Caesarea_ (Augusta), which occupied  almost the same site. It should be remarked that the Algerians  pronounce the _g[=i]m_ hard: not Al-Jeza[=i]r. Europeans spelt the name  in all sorts of ways: Arger, Argel, Argeir, Algel, &c., down to the  French Alger and our Algiers.          II.    THE LAND OF THE CORSAIRS.      It is time to ask how it was that a spacious land seemed to lie vacant  for the Corsairs to occupy, and a land too that offered almost every  feature that a pirate could desire for the safe and successful  prosecution of his trade. Geographers tell us that in climate and  formation the island of Barbary, for such it is geologically, is  really part of Europe, towards which, in history, it has played so  unfriendly a part. Once the countries, which we now know as Tunis,  Algiers, and Morocco, stood up abruptly as an island, with a  comparatively small lake washing its northern shore, and a huge ocean  on the south (see the map). That ocean is now the _Sahra_ or Sahara,  which engineers dream of again flooding with salt water, and so  forming an inland African sea. The lake is now the Mediterranean, or  rather its western basin, for we know that the Barbary island was once  nearly a peninsula, joined at its two ends to Spain and Sicily, and  that its Atlas ranges formed the connection between the Sierra Nevada  and Mt. Aetna. By degrees the Isthmus between Cape Bona and Sicily  sank out of sight, and the ocean flowed between Spain and Africa,  while the great sea to the south dried up into the immense stony waste  which is known preeminently as _the_ Sahra, the Desert, \"a tract of  land, bare as the back of a beast, without trees or mountains.\"    [Illustration: _After Bourguignat_ _Walker & Boutallsc._    THE BARBARY PENINSULA.    (_Elisee Reclus._)]    Through one or both of these narrow straits, Gibraltar and Malta, all  vessels from the outer ocean bound for the ports of France and Italy  and the Levant, were obliged to pass; and it must be remembered that  just about the time when the Corsairs made their appearance in  Barbary, the riches of the new-found Western world were beginning to  pour through the straits to meet those of the East, which were brought  to France and Spain, England and Holland, from Alexandria and Smyrna.  An immense proportion of the trade of Europe had to cross the western  basin of the Mediterranean, of which Barbary formed the southern  boundary. Any bold man who could hold Tunis at the eastern corner, or  Algiers in the middle, or Ceuta or Tangiers at the western point,  might reckon upon numerous opportunities of stopping argosies of  untold wealth as they passed by his lair. The situation seemed  purposely contrived for Corsairs.    [Illustration: A MAP OF THE KINGDOMS OF BARBARY.    (_Voyages to Barbary for the Redemption of Captives, 1736._)]    More than this, the coast was just what a pirate wants. The map shows  a series of natural harbours, often backed by lagunes which offer  every facility for the escape of the rover from his pursuers; and  while in the sixteenth century there were no deep ports for vessels of  heavy draught, there were endless creeks, shallow harbours, and  lagunes where the Corsairs' galleys (which never drew more than six  feet of water) could take refuge. Behind Jerba, the fabled island of  the Lotus-Eaters, was an immense inland sea, commanded in the Middle  Ages by castles, and affording a refuge for which the rovers had often  had cause to be grateful. Merchant vessels were shy of sailing in the  dangerous Gulf of the Greater Syrtes with its heavy tides and  spreading sandbanks, and even the war-galleys of Venice and Spain were  at a disadvantage when manoeuvring in its treacherous eddies against  the Corsair who knew every inch of the coast. Passing westward, a  famous medieval fortress, with the remains of a harbour, is seen at  Mahd[=i]ya, the \"Africa\" of the chroniclers. Next, Tunis presents the  finest harbour on all the Barbary coast; within its Goletta (or  \"Throat\") a vessel is safe from all the winds that blow, and if a  canal were cut to join it with the inland lake of Bizerta, a deep  harbour would be formed big enough to hold all the shipping of the  Mediterranean. The ancient ports of Carthage and Porto Farina offered  more protection in the Corsairs' time than now when the sand has  choked the coast; and in the autumn months a vessel needed all the  shelter she could get when the Cyprian wind was blowing off Cape Bona.  Close to the present Algerine frontier is Tabarka, which the Lomellini  family of Genoa found a thriving situation for their trading  establishments. Lacalle, once a famous nest of pirates, had then a  fine harbour, as the merchants of Marseilles discovered when they  superintended the coral fisheries from the neighbouring Bastion de  France. Bona, just beyond, has its roads, and formerly possessed a  deep harbour. J[=i]jil, an impregnable post, held successively by  Phoenicians, Normans, Romans, Pisans, and Genoese, till Barbarossa got  possession of it and made it a fortress of refuge for his Corsairs,  stands on a rocky peninsula joined by a sandy isthmus to the mainland,  with a port well sheltered by a natural breakwater. Further on were  Buj[=e]ya (Bougie), its harbour well protected from the worst winds;  Algiers, not then a port, but soon to become one; Shersh[=e]l, with a  harbour to be shunned in a heavy swell from the north, but otherwise a  valuable nook for sea rovers; Tinnis, not always accessible, but safe  when you were inside; and Oran, with the important harbour of Mars  El-Keb[=i]r the \"Portus Divinus\" of the Romans; while beyond, the  Jamia-el-Ghazaw[=a]t or Pirates' Mosque, shows where a favourite  creek offered an asylum between the Brothers Rocks for distressed  Corsairs. Passing Tangiers and Ceuta (Septa), and turning beyond the  Straits, various shelters are found, and amongst others the celebrated  ports of Sal[=e], which, in spite of its bar of sand, managed to send  out many mischievous craft to harass the argosies on their return from  the New World.    Not only were there ports in abundance for the shelter of galleys, but  the land behind was all that could be desired. River indeed there was  none capable of navigation, but the very shortness of the watershed  which precluded the possibility of great streams brought with it a  counterbalancing advantage; for the mountains rise so steep and high  near the coast that the Corsairs' look-out could sight the vessels to  be attacked a long way out to sea, and thus give notice of a prize or  warning of an enemy. Moreover the land produced all that was needed to  content the heart of man. Below the mountains where the Berbers dwelt  and the steppes where Arab shepherds roamed, fertile valleys spread to  the seashore. Jerba was a perfect garden of corn and fruit, vines,  olives, almonds, apricots, and figs; Tunis stood in the midst of green  fields, and deserved the title of \"the White, the Odoriferous, the  Flowery Bride of the West,\"--though, indeed, the second epithet,  according to its inhabitants, was derived from the odour of the lake  which received the drainage of the city, to which they ascribed its  peculiar salubrity.    What more could be required in a land which was, now to become a nest  of pirates? Yet, as though this were not sufficient, one more virtue  was added. The coast was visited by terrible gales, which, while  avoidable by those who had experience and knew where to run, were  fatal to the unwary, and foiled many an attack of the avenging enemy.    It remains to explain how it was that the Corsairs were able to  possess themselves of this convenient territory, which was neither  devoid of inhabitants nor without settled governments.    North Africa--the only Africa known to the ancients--had seen many  rulers come and go since the Arabs under Okba first overran its plains  and valleys. Dynasty had succeeded dynasty; the Arab governors under  the Khalifs of Damascus and Baghd[=a]d had made room for the Houses of  Idr[=i]s (A.D. 788) and Aghlab (800); these in turn had given way to  the F[=a]tim[=i] Khalifs (909); and when these schismatics removed  their seat of power from their newly founded capital of Mahd[=i]ya to  their final metropolis of Cairo (968), their western empire speedily  split up into the several princedoms of the Zeyr[=i]s of Tunis, the  Ben[=i] Hamm[=a]d of Tilims[=a]n, and other minor governments. At the  close of the eleventh century, the Mur[=a]bits or Almoravides, a  Berber dynasty, imposed their authority over the greater part of North  Africa and Spain, but gave place in the middle of the twelfth to the  Muwahhids or Almohades, whose rule extended from the Atlantic to  Tunis, and endured for over a hundred years. On the ruins of their  vast empire three separate and long-lived dynasties sprang up: the  Ben[=i] Hafs in Tunis (1228-1534), the Ben[=i] Ziy[=a]n in Central  Maghrib (1235-1400), and the Ben[=i] Merin in Morocco (1200-1550). To  complete the chronology it may be added that these were succeeded in  the sixteenth century by the Corsair Pashas (afterwards Deys) of  Algiers, the Turkish Pashas or Beys of Tunis, and the Sher[=i]fs or  Emperors of Morocco. The last still continue to reign; but the Deys of  Algiers have given place to the French, and the Bey of Tunis is under  French tutelage.    Except during the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22217"],[0,"My Reminiscences (#4)"],[1," There was yet another place in our house which I have even yet not  succeeded in finding out. A little girl playmate of my own age called  this the \"King's palace.\"[6] \"I have just been there,\" she would  sometimes tell me. But somehow the propitious moment never turned up  when she could take me along with her. That was a wonderful place, and  its playthings were as wonderful as the games that were played there. It  seemed to me it must be somewhere very near--perhaps in the first or  second storey; the only thing was one never seemed to be able to get  there. How often have I asked my companion, \"Only tell me, is it really  inside the house or outside?\" And she would always reply, \"No, no, it's  in this very house.\" I would sit and wonder: \"Where then can it be?  Don't I know all the rooms of the house?\" Who the king might be I never  cared to inquire; where his palace is still remains undiscovered; this  much was clear--the king's palace was within our house.    Looking back on childhood's days the thing that recurs most often is the  mystery which used to fill both life and world. Something undreamt of  was lurking everywhere and the uppermost question every day was: when,  Oh! when would we come across it? It was as if nature held something in  her closed hands and was smilingly asking us: \"What d'you think I have?\"  What was impossible for her to have was the thing we had no idea of.    Well do I remember the custard apple seed which I had planted and kept  in a corner of the south verandah, and used to water every day. The  thought that the seed might possibly grow into a tree kept me in a great  state of fluttering wonder. Custard apple seeds still have the habit of  sprouting, but no longer to the accompaniment of that feeling of wonder.  The fault is not in the custard apple but in the mind. We had once  stolen some rocks from an elder cousin's rockery and started a little  rockery of our own. The plants which we sowed in its interstices were  cared for so excessively that it was only because of their vegetable  nature that they managed to put up with it till their untimely death.  Words cannot recount the endless joy and wonder which this miniature  mountain-top held for us. We had no doubt that this creation of ours  would be a wonderful thing to our elders also. The day that we sought to  put this to the proof, however, the hillock in the corner of our room,  with all its rocks, and all its vegetation, vanished. The knowledge that  the schoolroom floor was not a proper foundation for the erection of a  mountain was imparted so rudely, and with such suddenness, that it gave  us a considerable shock. The weight of stone of which the floor was  relieved settled on our minds when we realised the gulf between our  fancies and the will of our elders.    How intimately did the life of the world throb for us in those days!  Earth, water, foliage and sky, they all spoke to us and would not be  disregarded. How often were we struck by the poignant regret that we  could only see the upper storey of the earth and knew nothing of its  inner storey. All our planning was as to how we could pry beneath its  dust-coloured cover. If, thought we, we could drive in bamboo after  bamboo, one over the other, we might perhaps get into some sort of touch  with its inmost depths.    During the _Magh_ festival a series of wooden pillars used to be planted  round the outer courtyard for supporting the chandeliers. Digging holes  for these would begin on the first of _Magh_. The preparations for  festivity are ever interesting to young folk. But this digging had a  special attraction for me. Though I had watched it done year after  year--and seen the hole grow bigger and bigger till the digger had  completely disappeared inside, and yet nothing extraordinary, nothing  worthy of the quest of prince or knight, had ever appeared--yet every  time I had the feeling that the lid being lifted off a chest of mystery.  I felt that a little bit more digging would do it. Year after year  passed, but that bit never got done. There was a pull at the curtain but  it was not drawn. The elders, thought I, can do whatever they please,  why do they rest content with such shallow delving? If we young folk had  the ordering of it, the inmost mystery of the earth would no longer be  allowed to remain smothered in its dust covering.    And the thought that behind every part of the vault of blue reposed the  mysteries of the sky would also spur our imaginings. When our Pundit, in  illustration of some lesson in our Bengali science primer, told us that  the blue sphere was not an enclosure, how thunderstruck we were! \"Put  ladder upon ladder,\" said he, \"and go on mounting away, but you will  never bump your head.\" He must be sparing of his ladders, I opined, and  questioned with a rising inflection, \"And what if we put more ladders,  and more, and more?\" When I realised that it was fruitless multiplying  ladders I remained dumbfounded pondering over the matter. Surely, I  concluded, such an astounding piece of news must be known only to those  who are the world's schoolmasters!          PART II          (4) _Servocracy_      In the history of India the regime of the Slave Dynasty was not a happy  one. In going back to the reign of the servants in my own life's history  I can find nothing glorious or cheerful touching the period. There were  frequent changes of king, but never a variation in the code of  restraints and punishments with which we were afflicted. We, however,  had no opportunity at the time for philosophising on the subject; our  backs bore as best they could the blows which befell them: and we  accepted as one of the laws of the universe that it is for the Big to  hurt and for the Small to be hurt. It has taken me a long time to learn  the opposite truth that it is the Big who suffer and the Small who cause  suffering.    The quarry does not view virtue and vice from the standpoint of the  hunter. That is why the alert bird, whose cry warns its fellows before  the shot has sped, gets abused as vicious. We howled when we were  beaten, which our chastisers did not consider good manners; it was in  fact counted sedition against the servocracy. I cannot forget how, in  order effectively to suppress such sedition, our heads used to be  crammed into the huge water jars then in use; distasteful, doubtless,  was this outcry to those who caused it; moreover, it was likely to have  unpleasant consequences.    I now sometimes wonder why such cruel treatment was meted out to us by  the servants. I cannot admit that there was on the whole anything in our  behaviour or demeanour to have put us beyond the pale of human kindness.  The real reason must have been that the whole of our burden was thrown  on the servants, and the whole burden is a thing difficult to bear even  for those who are nearest and dearest. If children are only allowed to  be children, to run and play about and satisfy their curiosity, it  becomes quite simple. Insoluble problems are only created if you try to  confine them inside, keep them still or hamper their play. Then does the  burden of the child, so lightly borne by its own childishness, fall  heavily on the guardian--like that of the horse in the fable which was  carried instead of being allowed to trot on its own legs: and though  money procured bearers even for such a burden it could not prevent them  taking it out of the unlucky beast at every step.    Of most of these tyrants of our childhood I remember only their cuffings  and boxings, and nothing more. Only one personality stands out in my  memory.    His name was Iswar. He had been a village schoolmaster before. He was a  prim, proper and sedately dignified personage. The Earth seemed too  earthy for him, with too little water to keep it sufficiently clean; so  that he had to be in a constant state of warfare with its chronic soiled  state. He would shoot his water-pot into the tank with a lightning  movement so as to get his supply from an uncontaminated depth. It was he  who, when bathing in the tank, would be continually thrusting away the  surface impurities till he took a sudden plunge expecting, as it were,  to catch the water unawares. When walking his right arm stood out at an  angle from his body, as if, so it seemed to us, he could not trust the  cleanliness even of his own garments. His whole bearing had the  appearance of an effort to keep clear of the imperfections which,  through unguarded avenues, find entrance into earth, water and air, and  into the ways of men. Unfathomable was the depth of his gravity. With  head slightly tilted he would mince his carefully selected words in a  deep voice. His literary diction would give food for merriment to our  elders behind his back, some of his high-flown phrases finding a  permanent place in our family repertoire of witticisms. But I doubt  whether the expressions he used would sound as remarkable to-day;  showing how the literary and spoken languages, which used to be as sky  from earth asunder, are now coming nearer each other.    This erstwhile schoolmaster had discovered a way of keeping us quiet in  the evenings. Every evening he would gather us round the cracked  castor-oil lamp and read out to us stories from the Ramayana and  Mahabharata. Some of the other servants would also come and join the  audience. The lamp would be throwing huge shadows right up to the beams  of the roof, the little house lizards catching insects on the walls, the  bats doing a mad dervish dance round and round the verandahs outside,  and we listening in silent open-mouthed wonder.    I still remember, on the evening we came to the story of Kusha and Lava,  and those two valiant lads were threatening to humble to the dust the  renown of their father and uncles, how the tense silence of that dimly  lighted room was bursting with eager anticipation. It was getting late,  our prescribed period of wakefulness was drawing to a "]]]
