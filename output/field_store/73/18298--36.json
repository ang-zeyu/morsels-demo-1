[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],[0,"The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#4)"],[1,"question is  perhaps an instance of the sort of difficulty which made the author give  up the division of his argument into two Parts when he wrote the  _Origin_. As matters stand Sec.Sec. IV. and V. of the 1842 Essay correspond to  the geological chapters, IX and X, in the _Origin_. From this point  onwards the material is grouped in the same order in both works:  geographical distribution; affinities and classification; unity of type  and morphology; abortive or rudimentary organs; recapitulation and  conclusion.    In enlarging the Essay of 1842 into that of 1844, the author retained  the sections of the sketch as chapters in the completer presentment. It  follows that what has been said of the relation of the earlier Essay to  the _Origin_ is generally true of the 1844 Essay. In the latter,  however, the geological discussion is, clearly instead of obscurely,  divided into two chapters, which correspond roughly with Chapters IX and  X of the _Origin_. But part of the contents of Chapter X (_Origin_)  occurs in Chapter VI (1844) on Geographical Distribution. The treatment  of distribution is particularly full and interesting in the 1844 Essay,  but the arrangement of the material, especially the introduction of Sec.  III. p. 183, leads to some repetition which is avoided in the _Origin_.  It should be noted that Hybridism, which has a separate chapter (VIII)  in the _Origin_, is treated in Chapter II of the Essay. Finally that  Chapter XIII (_Origin_) corresponds to Chapters VII, VIII and IX of the  work of 1844.    The fact that in 1842, seventeen years before the publication of the  _Origin_, my father should have been able to write out so full an  outline of his future work, is very remarkable. In his Autobiography{25}  he writes of the 1844 Essay, \"But at that time I overlooked one problem  of great importance.... This problem is the tendency in organic beings  descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become  modified.\" The absence of the principle of divergence is of course also  a characteristic of the sketch of 1842. But at p. 37, the author is not  far from this point of view. The passage referred to is: \"If any  species, _A_, in changing gets an advantage and that advantage ... is  inherited, _A_ will be the progenitor of several genera or even families  in the hard struggle of nature. _A_ will go on beating out other forms,  it might come that _A_ would people <the> earth,--we may now not have one  descendant on our globe of the one or several original creations{26}.\"  But if the descendants of _A_ have peopled the earth by beating out  other forms, they must have diverged in occupying the innumerable  diverse modes of life from which they expelled their predecessors. What  I wrote{27} on this subject in 1887 is I think true: \"Descent with  modification implies divergence, and we become so habituated to a belief  in descent, and therefore in divergence, that we do not notice the  absence of proof that divergence is in itself an advantage.\"         {25} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.         {26} In the footnotes to the Essay of 1844 attention is called to       similar passages.         {27} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 15.    The fact that there is no set discussion on the principle of divergence  in the 1844 Essay, makes it clear why the joint paper read before the  Linnean Society on July 1, 1858, included a letter{28} to Asa Gray, as  well as an extract{29} from the Essay of 1844. It is clearly because the  letter to Gray includes a discussion on divergence, and was thus,  probably, the only document, including this subject, which could be  appropriately made use of. It shows once more how great was the  importance attached by its author to the principle of divergence.         {28} The passage is given in the _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 124.         {29} The extract consists of the section on _Natural Means of       Selection_, p. 87.    I have spoken of the hurried and condensed manner in which the sketch of  1842 is written; the style of the later Essay (1844) is more finished.  It has, however, the air of an uncorrected MS. rather than of a book  which has gone through the ordeal of proof sheets. It has not all the  force and conciseness of the _Origin_, but it has a certain freshness  which gives it a character of its own. It must be remembered that the  _Origin_ was an abstract or condensation of a much bigger book, whereas  the Essay of 1844 was an expansion of the sketch of 1842. It is not  therefore surprising that in the _Origin_ there is occasionally evident  a chafing against the author's self-imposed limitation. Whereas in the  1844 Essay there is an air of freedom, as if the author were letting  himself go, rather than applying the curb. This quality of freshness and  the fact that some questions were more fully discussed in 1844 than in  1859, makes the earlier work good reading even to those who are familiar  with the _Origin_.    The writing of this Essay \"during the summer of 1844,\" as stated in the  Autobiography{30}, and \"from memory,\" as Darwin says elsewhere{31}, was  a remarkable achievement, and possibly renders more conceivable the  still greater feat of the writing of the _Origin_ between July 1858 and  September 1859.         {30} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.         {31} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 18.    It is an interesting subject for speculation: what influence on the  world the Essay of 1844 would have exercised, had it been published in  place of the Origin. The author evidently thought of its publication in  its present state as an undesirable expedient, as appears clearly from  the following extracts from the _Life and Letters_, vol. ii. pp.  16--18:    _C. Darwin to Mrs Darwin._    DOWN, _July 5, 1844_.    \"... I have just finished my sketch of my species theory. If, as I  believe, my theory in time be accepted even by one competent judge, it  will be a considerable step in science.    \"I therefore write this in case of my sudden death, as my most solemn  and last request, which I am sure you will consider the same as if  legally entered in my will, that you will devote L400 to its  publication, and further will yourself, or through Hensleigh{32}, take  trouble in promoting it. I wish that my sketch be given to some  competent person, with this sum to induce him to take trouble in its  improvement and enlargement. I give to him all my books on Natural  History, which are either scored or have references at the end to the  pages, begging him carefully to look over and consider such passages as  actually bearing, or by possibility bearing, on this subject. I wish you  to make a list of all such books as some temptation to an editor. I also  request that you will hand over <to> him all those scraps roughly divided  into eight or ten brown paper portfolios. The scraps, with copied  quotations from various works, are those which may aid my editor. I also  request that you, or some amanuensis, will aid in deciphering any of the  scraps which the editor may think possibly of use. I leave to the  editor's judgment whether to interpolate these facts in the text, or as  notes, or under appendices. As the looking over the references and  scraps will be a long labour, and as the _correcting_ and enlarging and  altering my sketch will also take considerable time, I leave this sum of  L400 as some remuneration, and any profits from the work. I consider  that for this the editor is bound to get the sketch published either at  a publisher's or his own risk. Many of the scraps in the portfolios  contain mere rude suggestions and early views, now useless, and many of  the facts will probably turn out as having no bearing on my theory.         {32} Mrs Darwin's brother.    \"With respect to editors, Mr Lyell would be the best if he would  undertake it; I believe he would find the work pleasant, and he would  learn some facts new to him. As the editor must be a geologist as well  as a naturalist, the next best editor would be Professor Forbes of  London. The next best (and quite best in many respects) would be  Professor Henslow. Dr Hooker would be _very_ good. The next, Mr  Strickland{33}. If none of these would undertake it, I would request you  to consult with Mr Lyell, or some other capable man, for some editor, a  geologist and naturalist. Should one other hundred pounds make the  difference of procuring a good editor, I request earnestly that you will  raise L500.         {33} After Mr Strickland's name comes the following sentence, which       has been erased, but remains legible. \"Professor Owen would be very       good; but I presume he would not undertake such a work.\"    \"My remaining collections in Natural History may be given to any one or  any museum where <they> would be accepted....\"    <The following note seems to have formed part of the original letter,  but may have been of later date:>    \"Lyell, especially with the aid of Hooker (and of any good zoological  aid), would be best of all. Without an editor will pledge himself to  give up time to it, it would be of no use paying such a sum.    \"If there should be any difficulty in getting an editor who would go  thoroughly into the subject, and think of the bearing of the passages  marked in the books and copied out of scraps of paper, then let my  sketch be published as it is, stating that it was done several years  ago{34}, and from memory without consulting any works, and with no  intention of publication in its present form.\"         {34} The words \"several years ago, and\" seem to have been added at       a later date.    The idea that the sketch of 1844 might remain, in the event of his  death, as the only record of his work, seems to have been long in his  mind, for in August, 1854, when he had finished with the Cirripedes, and  was thinking of beginning his \"species work,\" he added on the back of  the above letter, \"Hooker by far best man to edit my species volume.  August 1854.\"    I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#4)"],[1,".  Tom hurriedly entered the ARROW.    \"Did he do any damage?\" asked Mr. Hastings.    \"I guess he didn't have time,\" responded Tom.  \"But he was tampering  with the lock on the door of the forward compartment.  What's in there?\"    \"Nothing but the gasoline tank.  I keep the bulkhead sliding door  locked on general principles.  I can't imagine what the fellow would  want to open it for.  There's nothing of value in there.  Perhaps he  isn't right in his head.  Was he a tramp?\"    \"No, he was well dressed but he seemed very nervous during the auction,  as if he was disappointed not to have secured the boat.  Yet what could  he want in that compartment? Have you the key to the lock, Mr.  Hastings?\"    \"Yes, it belongs to you now, Mr. Swift,\" and the former owner handed it  to Tom, who quickly unlocked the compartment.  He slid back the door  and peered within, but all he saw was the big galvanized tank.    \"Nothing in there he could want,\" commented the former owner of the  craft.    \"No,\" agreed Tom in a low voice.  \"I don't see what he wanted to open  the door for.\" But the time was to come, and not far off, when Tom was  to discover quite a mystery connected with the forward compartment of  his boat, and the solution of it was fated to bring him into no little  danger.    \"It certainly is odd,\" went on Mr. Hastings when, after Tom had secured  the screw driver from his motor-cycle tool bag, he aided the lad in  removing the letters from the bow of the boat \"Are you sure you don't  know the man?\"    \"No, I never saw him before.  At first I thought his voice sounded like  one of the members of the Happy Harry gang, but when I looked squarely  at him I could not see a bit of resemblance.  Besides, that gang would  not venture again into this neighborhood.\"    \"No, I imagine not.  Perhaps he was only a curious, meddlesome person.  I have frequently been bothered by such individuals.  They want to see  all the working parts of an automobile or motor-boat, and they don't  care what damage they do by investigating.\"    Tom did not reply, but he was pretty certain that the man in question  had more of an object than mere curiosity in tampering with the boat.  However, he could discover no solution just then, and he proceeded with  the work of taking off the letters.    \"What are you going to do with your boat, now that you have it?\" asked  Mr. Hastings.  \"Can you run it down to your dock in the condition in  which it is now?\"    \"No, I shall have to go back home, get some tools and fix up the motor.  It will take half a day, at least.  I will come back this afternoon  and, have the boat at my house by night.  That is if I may leave it at  your dock here.\"    \"Certainly, as long as you like.\"    The young inventor had many things to think about as he rode toward  home, and though he was somewhat puzzled over the actions of the  stranger, he forgot about that in anticipating the pleasure he would  have when the motor-boat was in running order.    \"I'll take dad off on a cruise about the lake,\" he decided.  \"He needs  a rest, for he's been working hard and worrying over the theft of the  turbine motor model.  I'll take Ned Newton for some rides, too, and he  can bring his camera along and get a lot of pictures.  Oh, I'll have  some jolly sport this summer!\"    Tom was riding swiftly along a quiet country road and was approaching a  steep hill, which he could not see until he was close to it, owing to a  sharp turn.    As he was about to swing around it and coast swiftly down the steep  declivity he was startled by hearing a voice calling to him from the  bushes at the side of the road.    \"Hold on, dar! hold on, Mistah Swift!\" cried a colored man, suddenly  popping into view.  \"Doan't go down dat hill.\"    \"Why, it's Eradicate Sampson!\" exclaimed Tom, quickly shutting off the  power and applying the brakes.  \"What's the matter, Rad? Why shouldn't  I go down that hill?\"    \"Beca'se, Mistah Swift, dere's a pow'ful monstrous tree trunk right  across de road at a place whar yo' cain't see it till yo' gits right on  top ob it.  Ef yo' done hit dat ar tree on yo' lickity-split machine,  yo' suah would land in kingdom come.  Doan't go down dat hill!\"    Tom leaped off his machine and approached the colored man.  Eradicate  Sampson did odd jobs in the neighborhood of Shopton, and more than once  Tom had done him favors in repairing his lawn mower or his wood-sawing  machine.  In turn Eradicate had given Tom a valuable clue as to the  hiding place of the model thieves.    \"How'd the log get across the road, Rad?\" asked Tom.    \"I dunno, Mistah Swift.  I see it when I come along wid mah mule,  Boomerang, an' I tried t' git it outer de way, but I couldn't.  Den I  left Boomerang an' mah wagon at de foot ob de hill an' I come up heah  t' git a long pole t' pry de log outer de way.  I didn't t'ink nobody  would come along, case dis road ain't much trabeled.\"    \"I took it for a short cut,\" said the lad.  \"Come on, let's take a look  at the log.\"    Leaving his machine at the top of the slope, the young inventor  accompanied the colored man 'down the hill.  At the foot of it, well  hidden from sight of any one who might come riding down, was a big log.  It was all the way across the road.    \"That never fell there,\" exclaimed Tom in some excitement.  \"That never  rolled off a load of logs, even if there had been one along, which  there wasn't.  That log was put there!\"    \"Does yo' t'ink dat, Mistah Swift?\" asked Eradicate, his eyes getting  big.    \"I certainly do, and, if you hadn't warned me, I might have been  killed.\"    \"Oh, I heard yo' lickity-split machine chug-chuggin' along when I were  in de bushes, lookin' for a pryin' pole, an' I hurried out to warn yo.  I knowed I could leave Boomerang safe, 'case he's asleep.\"    \"I'm glad you did warn me,\" went on the youth solemnly.  Then, as he  went closer to the log, he uttered an exclamation.    \"That has been dragged here by an automobile!\" he cried.  \"It's been  done on purpose to injure some one.  Come on, Rad, let's see if we  can't find out who did it.\"    Something on the ground caught Tom's eye.  He stooped and picked up a  nickle-plated wrench.    \"This may come in handy as evidence,\" he murmured.          CHAPTER IV    TOM AND ANDY CLASH      Even a casual observer could have told that an auto had had some part  in dragging the log to the place where it blockaded the road.  In the  dust were many marks of the big rubber tires and even the imprint of a  rope, which had been used to tow the tree trunk.    \"What fo' yo' t'ink any one put dat log dere?\" asked the colored man as  he followed Tom.  Boomerang, the mule, so called because Eradicate said  you never could tell what he was going to do, opened his eyes lazily  and closed them again.  \"I don't know why, Rad, unless they wanted to  wreck an automobile or a wagon.  Maybe tramps did it for spite.\"    \"Maybe some one done it to make yo' hab trouble, Mistah Swift.\"    \"No, I hardly think so.  I don't know of any one who would want to make  trouble for me, and how would they know I was coming this way--\"    Tom suddenly checked himself.  The memory of the scene at the auction  came back to him and he recalled what Andy Foger had said about  \"'getting even.\"    \"Which way did dat auto go?\" resumed Eradicate.    \"It came from down the road,\" answered Tom, not completing the sentence  he had left unfinished.  \"They dragged the log up to the foot of the  hill and left it.  Then the auto went down this way.\" It was  comparatively easy, for a lad of such sharp observation as was Tom, to  trace the movements of the vehicle.    \"Den if it's down heah, maybe we cotch 'em,\" suggested the colored man.    The young inventor did not answer at once.  He was hurrying along, his  eyes on the telltale marks.  He had proceeded some distance from the  place where the log was when he uttered a cry.  At the same moment he  hurried from the road toward a thick clump of bushes that were in the  ditch alongside of the highway.  Reaching them, he parted the leaves  and called:    \"Here's the auto, Rad!\"    The colored man ran up, his eyes wider open than ever.  There, hidden  amid the bushes, was a large touring car.    \"Whose am dat?\" asked Eradicate.    Tom did not answer.  He penetrated the underbrush, noting where the  broken branches had been bent upright after the forced entrance of the  car, the better to hide it.  The young inventor was, seeking some clew  to discover the owner of the machine.  To this end he climbed up in the  tonneau and was looking about when some one burst in through the screen  of bushes and a voice cried: \"Here, you get out of my car!\"    \"Oh, is it your car, Andy Foger?\" asked Tom calmly as he recognized his  squint-eyed rival.  \"I was just beginning to think it was.  Allow me to  return your wrench,\" and he held out the one he had picked up near the  log.  \"The next time you drag trees across the road,\" went on the lad  in the tonneau, facing the angry and dismayed Andy, \"I'd advise you to  post a notice at the top of the hill, so persons riding down will not  be injured.\"    \"Notice--road--hill--logs!\" stammered Andy, turning red under his  freckles.    \"That's what I said,\" replied Tom coolly.    \"I--I didn't have anything to do with putting a log across any road,\"  mumbled the bully.  \"I--I've been off toward the creek.\"    \"Have you?\" asked Tom with a peculiar smile.    \"I thought you might have been looking for the wrench you dropped near  the log.  You should be more careful and so should Sam Snedecker, who's  hiding outside the bushes,\" went on our hero, for he had caught sight  of the form of Andy's crony.  \"I--I told him not to do it!\" exclaimed  Sam as he came from his hiding place.    \"Shut up!\" exclaimed Andy desperately.    \"Oh, I think I know your secret,\" continued the young inventor.  \"You  wanted to get even with me for outbidding you on the motor-boat.  You  watched which road I took, and then,"]]]
