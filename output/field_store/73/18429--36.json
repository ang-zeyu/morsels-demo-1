Sometimes you  would hear only a gentle persuasive cooing, or a quiet confidential  chattering; then that long, loud call, taken up by first one, then  another, as they sat about upon the naked limbs; anon, a sort of wild,  rollicking laughter, intermingled with various cries, yelps, and  squeals, as if some incident had excited their mirth and ridicule.  Whether this social hilarity and boisterousness is in celebration of the  pairing or mating ceremony, or whether it is only a sort of annual  \"house-warming\" common among high-holes on resuming their summer  quarters, is a question upon which I reserve my judgment.    [Illustration: FLICKER]    Unlike most of his kinsmen, the golden-wing prefers the fields and the  borders of the forest to the deeper seclusion of the woods, and hence,  contrary to the habit of his tribe, obtains most of his subsistence from  the ground, probing it for ants and crickets. He is not quite satisfied  with being a woodpecker. He courts the society of the robin and the  finches, abandons the trees for the meadow, and feeds eagerly upon  berries and grain. What may be the final upshot of this course of living  is a question worthy the attention of Darwin. Will his taking to the  ground and his pedestrian feats result in lengthening his legs, his  feeding upon berries and grains subdue his tints and soften his voice,  and his associating with Robin put a song into his heart?           *       *       *       *       *    In the cavity of an apple-tree, much nearer the house than they usually  build, a pair of high-holes took up their abode. A knot-hole which led  to the decayed interior was enlarged, the live wood being cut away as  clean as a squirrel would have done it. The inside preparations I could  not witness, but day after day, as I passed near, I heard the bird  hammering away, evidently beating down obstructions and shaping and  enlarging the cavity. The chips were not brought out, but were used  rather to floor the interior. The woodpeckers are not nest-builders, but  rather nest-carvers.    The time seemed very short before the voices of the young were heard in  the heart of the old tree,--at first feebly, but waxing stronger day by  day until they could be heard many rods distant. When I put my hand upon  the trunk of the tree, they would set up an eager, expectant chattering;  but if I climbed up it toward the opening, they soon detected the  unusual sound and would hush quickly, only now and then uttering a  warning note. Long before they were fully fledged they clambered up to  the orifice to receive their food. As but one could stand in the opening  at a time, there was a good deal of elbowing and struggling for this  position. It was a very desirable one aside from the advantages it had  when food was served; it looked out upon the great, shining world, into  which the young birds seemed never tired of gazing. The fresh air must  have been a consideration also, for the interior of a high-hole's  dwelling is not sweet. When the parent birds came with food, the young  one in the opening did not get it all, but after he had received a  portion, either on his own motion or on a hint from the old one, he  would give place to the one behind him. Still, one bird evidently  outstripped his fellows, and in the race of life was two or three days  in advance of them. His voice was loudest and his head oftenest at the  window. But I noticed that, when he had kept the position too long, the  others evidently made it uncomfortable in his rear, and, after  \"fidgeting\" about awhile, he would be compelled to \"back down.\" But  retaliation was then easy, and I fear his mates spent few easy moments  at that lookout. They would close their eyes and slide back into the  cavity as if the world had suddenly lost all its charms for them.    This bird was, of course, the first to leave the nest. For two days  before that event he kept his position in the opening most of the time  and sent forth his strong voice incessantly. The old ones abstained from  feeding him almost entirely, no doubt to encourage his exit. As I stood  looking at him one afternoon and noting his progress, he suddenly  reached a resolution,--seconded, I have no doubt, from the rear,--and  launched forth upon his untried wings. They served him well, and carried  him about fifty yards up-hill the first heat. The second day after, the  next in size and spirit left in the same manner; then another, till only  one remained. The parent birds ceased their visits to him, and for one  day he called and called till our ears were tired of the sound. His was  the faintest heart of all. Then he had none to encourage him from  behind. He left the nest and clung to the outer bole of the tree, and  yelped and piped for an hour longer; then he committed himself to his  wings and went his way like the rest.    The matchmaking of the high-holes, which often comes under my  observation, is in marked contrast to that of the robins and the  bluebirds. There does not appear to be any anger or any blows. The male  or two males will alight on a limb in front of the female, and go  through with a series of bowings and scrapings that are truly comical.  He spreads his tail, he puffs out his breast, he throws back his head  and then bends his body to the right and to the left, uttering all the  while a curious musical hiccough. The female confronts him unmoved, but  whether her attitude is critical or defensive, I cannot tell. Presently  she flies away, followed by her suitor or suitors, and the little comedy  is enacted on another stump or tree. Among all the woodpeckers the drum  plays an important part in the matchmaking. The male takes up his stand  on a dry, resonant limb, or on the ridgeboard of a building, and beats  the loudest call he is capable of. A favorite drum of the high-holes  about me is a hollow wooden tube, a section of a pump, which stands as a  bird-box upon my summer-house. It is a good instrument; its tone is  sharp and clear. A high-hole alights upon it, and sends forth a rattle  that can be heard a long way off. Then he lifts up his head and utters  that long April call, _Wick, wick, wick, wick_. Then he drums again. If  the female does not find him, it is not because he does not make noise  enough. But his sounds are all welcome to the ear. They are simple and  primitive, and voice well a certain sentiment of the April days. As I  write these lines I hear through the half-open door his call come up  from a distant field. Then I hear the steady hammering of one that has  been for three days trying to penetrate the weather boarding of the big  icehouse by the river, and to reach the sawdust filling for a  nesting-place.          THE PH[OE]BE      Another April bird whose memory I fondly cherish is the ph[oe]be-bird,  the pioneer of the flycatchers. In the inland farming districts, I used  to notice him, on some bright morning about Easter Day, proclaiming his  arrival, with much variety of motion and attitude, from the peak of the  barn or hay-shed. As yet, you may have heard only the plaintive,  homesick note of the bluebird, or the faint trill of the song sparrow;  and the ph[oe]be's clear, vivacious assurance of his veritable bodily  presence among us again is welcomed by all ears. At agreeable intervals  in his lay he describes a circle or an ellipse in the air, ostensibly  prospecting for insects, but really, I suspect, as an artistic flourish,  thrown in to make up in some way for the deficiency of his musical  performance. If plainness of dress indicates powers of song, as it  usually does, the ph[oe]be ought to be unrivaled in musical ability, for  surely that ashen-gray suit is the superlative of plainness; and that  form, likewise, would hardly pass for a \"perfect figure\" of a bird. The  seasonableness of his coming, however, and his civil, neighborly ways,  shall make up for all deficiencies in song and plumage.    The ph[oe]be-bird is a wise architect and perhaps enjoys as great an  immunity from danger, both in its person and its nest, as any other  bird. Its modest ashen-gray suit is the color of the rocks where it  builds, and the moss of which it makes such free use gives to its nest  the look of a natural growth or accretion. But when it comes into the  barn or under the shed to build, as it so frequently does, the moss is  rather out of place. Doubtless in time the bird will take the hint, and  when she builds in such places will leave the moss out. I noted but two  nests the summer I am speaking of: one in a barn failed of issue, on  account of the rats, I suspect, though the little owl may have been the  depredator; the other, in the woods, sent forth three young. This latter  nest was most charmingly and ingeniously placed. I discovered it while  in quest of pond-lilies, in a long, deep, level stretch of water in the  woods. A large tree had blown over at the edge of the water, and its  dense mass of upturned roots, with the black, peaty soil filling the  interstices, was like the fragment of a wall several feet high, rising  from the edge of the languid current. In a niche in this earthy wall,  and visible and accessible only from the water, a ph[oe]be had built her  nest and reared her brood. I paddled my boat up and came alongside  prepared to take the family aboard. The young, nearly ready to fly,  were quite undisturbed by my presence, having probably been assured that  no danger need be apprehended from that side. It was not a likely place  for minks, or they would not have been so secure.      THE COMING OF PH[OE]BE        When buckets shine 'gainst maple trees        And drop by drop the sap doth flow,      When days are warm, but still nights freeze,        And deep in woods lie drifts of snow,      When cattle low and fret in stall,      Then morning brings the ph[oe]be's call,                        "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#4)"],[1,"ice with a continually renewing  surface of the smoothest texture. Carrying a mercurial barometer that  one dare not intrust to a sled on one's back over such footing is a  somewhat precarious proceeding, but there was no alternative, and many  miles were thus passed. Up the Toklat, then up its Clearwater Fork, then  up its tributary, Myrtle Creek, to its head, and so over a little divide  and down Willow Creek, we went, and from that divide and the upper  reaches of the last-named creek had fine, clear views not only of Denali  but of Denali's Wife as well, now come much nearer and looming much  larger.    [Illustration: One of the abandoned mining towns in the Kantishna.]    [Sidenote: The Faces of the Mountain]    But here it may be stated once for all that the view which this face of  the mountains presents is never a satisfying one. The same is true in  even greater degree of the southern face, all photographs agreeing with  all travellers as to its tameness. There is only one face of the Denali  group that is completely satisfying, that is adequate to the full  picturesque potentiality of a twenty-thousand-foot elevation. The writer  has seen no other view, no other aspect of it, comparable to that of the  northwest face from Lake Minchumina. There the two mountains rise side  by side, sheer, precipitous, pointed rocks, utterly inaccessible,  savage, and superb. The rounded shoulders, the receding slopes and  ridges of the other faces detract from the uplift and from the dignity,  but the northwestern face is stark.    One more run, of much the same character as the previous day, and we  were at Eureka, in the heart of the Kantishna country, on Friday, 21st  March, being Good Friday.    We arrived there at noon and \"called it a day,\" and spent the rest of it  in the devotions of that august anniversary. Easter eve took us to  Glacier City, and we lay there over the feast, gathering three or four  men who were operating a prospecting-drill in that neighborhood for the  first public worship ever conducted in the Kantishna camp. Ten miles  more brought us to Diamond City, on the Bearpaw, where we found our  cache of food in good condition save that the field-mice, despite all  precautions, had made access to the cereals and had eaten all the rolled  oats.    Amongst the Kantishna miners, who were most kindly and generous in their  assistance, we were able to pick up enough large-sized moccasins to  serve the members of the party, and we wore nothing else at all on the  mountain.    [Illustration: Denali from the McKinley fork of the Kantishna River.    Showing the two peaks of the mountain, the one in the rear and to the  left (the South Peak) is the higher.]    [Sidenote: Timber-Line]    Our immediate task now lay before us. A ton and a half of supplies had  to be hauled some fifty miles across country to the base of the  mountain. Here the relaying began, stuff being taken ahead and cached at  some midway point, then another load taken right through a day's march,  and then a return made to bring up the cache. In this way we moved  steadily though slowly across rolling country and upon the surface of a  large lake to the McKinley Fork of the Kantishna, which drains the  Muldrow Glacier, down that stream to its junction with the Clearwater  Fork of the same, and up that fork, through its canyon, to the last  spruce timber on its banks, and there we made a camp in an exceedingly  pretty spot. The creek ran open through a break in the ice in front of  our tent; the water-ousels darted in and out under the ice, singing most  sweetly; the willows, all in bud, perfumed the air; and Denali soared  clear and brilliant, far above the range, right in front of us. Here at  the timber-line, at an elevation of about two thousand feet, was the  pleasantest camp of the whole excursion. During the five days' stay here  the stuff was brought up and carried forward, and a quantity of dry wood  was cut and advanced to a cache at the mouth of the creek by which we  should reach the Muldrow Glacier.    It should be said that the short and easy route by which that glacier is  reached was discovered after much scouting and climbing by McGonogill  and Taylor in 1910, upon the occasion of the \"pioneer\" attempt upon the  mountain, of which more will be said by and by. The men in the Kantishna  camp who took part in that attempt gave us all the information they  possessed, as they had done to the party that attempted the mountain  last summer. There has been no need to make reconnoissance for routes  since these pioneers blazed the way: there is no other practicable route  than the one they discovered. The two subsequent climbing parties have  followed precisely in their footsteps up as far as the Grand Basin at  sixteen thousand feet, and it is the merest justice that such  acknowledgment be made.    At our camp the Clearwater ran parallel with the range, which rose like  a great wall before us. Our approach was not directly toward Denali but  toward an opening in the range six or eight miles to the east of the  great mountain. This opening is known as Cache Creek. Passing the willow  patch at its mouth, where previous camps had been made, we pushed up the  creek some three miles more to its forks, and there established our base  camp, on 10th April, at about four thousand feet elevation. A few  scrubby willows struggled to grow in the creek bed, but the hills that  rose from one thousand five hundred to two thousand feet around us were  bare of any vegetation save moss and were yet in the main covered with  snow. Caribou signs were plentiful everywhere, and we were no more than  settled in camp when a herd appeared in sight.    [Illustration: Entering the range by Cache Creek.    The Muldrow Glacier flows between the peak in the background (Mt.  Brooks) and the ridge just below it.]    [Sidenote: Game and Its Preparation]    Our prime concern at this camp was the gathering and preserving of a  sufficient meat supply for our subsistence on the mountain. It was an  easy task. First Karstens killed a caribou and then Walter a  mountain-sheep. Then Esaias happened into the midst of a herd of caribou  as he climbed over a ridge, and killed three. That was all we needed.  Then we went to work preparing the meat. Why should any one haul canned  pemmican hundreds of miles into the greatest game country in the world?  We made our own pemmican of the choice parts of this tender, juicy meat  and we never lost appetite for it or failed to enjoy and assimilate it.  A fifty-pound lard-can, three parts filled with water, was set on the  stove and kept supplied with joints of meat. As a batch was cooked we  took it out and put more into the same water, removed the flesh from the  bones, and minced it. Then we melted a can of butter, added pepper and  salt to it, and rolled a handful of the minced meat in the butter and  moulded it with the hands into a ball about as large as a baseball. We  made a couple of hundred of such balls and froze them, and they kept  perfectly. When all the boiling was done we put in the hocks of the  animals and boiled down the liquor into five pounds of the thickest,  richest meat-extract jelly, adding the marrow from the bones. With this  pemmican and this extract of caribou, a package of erbswurst and a  cupful of rice, we concocted every night the stew which was our main  food in the higher regions.    [Illustration: Some heads of game killed at the base camp.]    [Sidenote: The Instruments]    Here the instruments were overhauled. The mercurial barometer reading by  verniers to three places of decimals was set up and read, and the two  aneroids were adjusted to read with it. These two aneroids perhaps  deserve a word. Aneroid A was a three-inch, three-circle instrument, the  invention of Colonel Watkins, of the British army, of range-finder fame.  It seems strange that the advantage of the three-circle aneroid is so  little known in this country, for its three concentric circles give such  an open scale that, although this particular instrument reads to  twenty-five thousand feet, it is easy to read as small a difference as  twenty feet on it. It had been carried in the hind sack of the writer's  sled for the past eight winters and constantly and satisfactorily used  to determine the height of summits and passes upon the trails of the  interior. Aneroid B was a six-inch patent mountain aneroid, another  invention of the same military genius, prompted by Mr. Whymper's  experiments with the aneroid barometer after his return from his classic  climbs to the summits of the Bolivian Andes. Colonel Watkins devised an  instrument in which by a threaded post and a thumb-screw the spring may  be relaxed or brought into play at will, and the instrument is never in  commission save when a reading is taken. Then a few turns of the  thumb-screw bring the spring to bear upon the box, its walls expand  until the pressure of the spring equals the pressure of the atmosphere,  the reading is taken, and the instrument thrown out of operation  again--a most ingenious arrangement by which it was hoped to overcome  some of the persistent faults of elastic-chamber barometers. The writer  had owned this instrument for the past ten years, but had never  opportunity to test its usefulness until now. So, although it read no  lower than about fifteen inches, he took it with him to observe its  operation. Lastly, completing the hypsometrical equipment, was a  boiling-point thermometer, with its own lamp and case, reading to 165  deg. by tenths of a degree.    Then there were the ice-creepers or crampons to adjust to the  moccasins--terribly heavy, clumsy rat-trap affairs they looked, but they  served us well on the higher reaches of the mountain and are, if not  indispensable, at least most valuable where hard snow or ice is to be  climbed. The snow-shoes, also, had to be rough-locked by lashing a  wedge-shaped bar of hardwood underneath,"]]]
