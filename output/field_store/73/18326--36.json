It was very essential that I should  impress Mrs. Hudson with the reality of my condition, since she was to  convey it to you, and you in turn to him.  You won't be offended,  Watson?  You will realize that among your many talents dissimulation  finds no place, and that if you had shared my secret you would never  have been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his  presence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme.  Knowing his  vindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would come to look  upon his handiwork.\"    \"But your appearance, Holmes--your ghastly face?\"    \"Three days of absolute fast does not improve one's beauty, Watson.  For the rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not cure.  With  vaseline upon one's forehead, belladonna in one's eyes, rouge over the  cheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one's lips, a very satisfying  effect can be produced. Malingering is a subject upon which I have  sometimes thought of writing a monograph.  A little occasional talk  about half-crowns, oysters, or any other extraneous subject produces a  pleasing effect of delirium.\"    \"But why would you not let me near you, since there was in truth no  infection?\"    \"Can you ask, my dear Watson?  Do you imagine that I have no respect  for your medical talents?  Could I fancy that your astute judgment  would pass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or  temperature?  At four yards, I could deceive you.  If I failed to do  so, who would bring my Smith within my grasp?  No, Watson, I would not  touch that box.  You can just see if you look at it sideways where the  sharp spring like a viper's tooth emerges as you open it.  I dare say  it was by some such device that poor Savage, who stood between this  monster and a reversion, was done to death.  My correspondence,  however, is, as you know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon my guard  against any packages which reach me.  It was clear to me, however, that  by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design I might  surprise a confession.  That pretence I have carried out with the  thoroughness of the true artist.  Thank you, Watson, you must help me  on with my coat.  When we have finished at the police-station I think  that something nutritious at Simpson's would not be out of place.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

The false and fond examples of thy lusts      Corrupt no less than they oppress, and sap      In the same moment all thy pageant power      And those who should sustain it; so that whether      A foreign foe invade, or civil broil      Distract within, both will alike prove fatal:      The first thy subjects have no heart to conquer;                    80      The last they rather would assist than vanquish.        _Sar._ Why, what makes thee the mouth-piece of the people?        _Sal._ Forgiveness of the Queen, my sister wrongs;      A natural love unto my infant nephews;      Faith to the King, a faith he may need shortly,      In more than words; respect for Nimrod's line;      Also, another thing thou knowest not.        _Sar._ What's that?        _Sal._               To thee an unknown word.        _Sar._                                        Yet speak it;      I love to learn.        _Sal._           Virtue.        _Sar._                  Not know the word!      Never was word yet rung so in my ears--                             90      Worse than the rabble's shout, or splitting trumpet:      I've heard thy sister talk of nothing else.        _Sal._ To change the irksome theme, then, hear of vice.        _Sar._ From whom?        _Sal._             Even from the winds, if thou couldst listen      Unto the echoes of the Nation's voice.        _Sar._ Come, I'm indulgent, as thou knowest, patient,      As thou hast often proved--speak out, what moves thee?        _Sal._ Thy peril.        _Sar._             Say on.        _Sal._                     Thus, then: all the nations,      For they are many, whom thy father left      In heritage, are loud in wrath against thee.                       100        _Sar._ 'Gainst _me!!_ What would the slaves?        _Sal._                                         A king.        _Sar._                                                 And what      Am I then?        _Sal._     In their eyes a nothing; but      In mine a man who might be something still.        _Sar._ The railing drunkards! why, what would they have?      Have they not peace and plenty?        _Sal._                          Of the first      More than is glorious: of the last, far less      Than the King recks of.        _Sar._                  Whose then is the crime,      But the false satraps, who provide no better?        _Sal._ And somewhat in the Monarch who ne'er looks      Beyond his palace walls, or if he stirs                            110      Beyond them, 'tis but to some mountain palace,      Till summer heats wear down. O glorious Baal!      Who built up this vast empire, and wert made      A God, or at the least shinest like a God      Through the long centuries of thy renown,      This, thy presumed descendant, ne'er beheld      As king the kingdoms thou didst leave as hero,      Won with thy blood, and toil, and time, and peril!      For what? to furnish imposts for a revel,      Or multiplied extortions for a minion.                             120        _Sar._ I understand thee--thou wouldst have me go      Forth as a conqueror. By all the stars      Which the Chaldeans read--the restless slaves[e]      Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes,      And lead them forth to glory.        _Sal._                       Wherefore not?      Semiramis--a woman only--led      These our Assyrians to the solar shores      Of Ganges.        _Sar._    Tis most true. And _how_ returned?        _Sal._ Why, like a _man_--a hero; baffled, but      Not vanquished. With but twenty guards, she made                   130      Good her retreat to Bactria.        _Sar._                       And how many      Left she behind in India to the vultures?        _Sal._ Our annals say not.        _Sar._                    Then I will say for them--      That she had better woven within her palace      Some twenty garments, than with twenty guards      Have fled to Bactria, leaving to the ravens,      And wolves, and men--the fiercer of the three,      Her myriads of fond subjects. Is _this_ Glory?      Then let me live in ignominy ever.        _Sal._ All warlike spirits have not the same fate.                 140      Semiramis, the glorious parent of      A hundred kings, although she failed in India,      Brought Persia--Media--Bactria--to the realm      Which she once swayed--and thou _mightst_ sway.        _Sar._                                         _I sway_ them--      She but subdued them.        _Sal._                It may be ere long      That they will need her sword more than your sceptre.        _Sar._ There was a certain Bacchus, was there not?      I've heard my Greek girls speak of such--they say      He was a God, that is, a Grecian god,      An idol foreign to Assyria's worship,                              150      Who conquered this same golden realm of Ind      Thou prat'st of, where Semiramis was vanquished.        _Sal._ I have heard of such a man; and thou perceiv'st      That he is deemed a God for what he did.        _Sar._ And in his godship I will honour him--      Not much as man. What, ho! my cupbearer!        _Sal._ What means the King?        _Sar._                     To worship your new God      And ancient conqueror. Some wine, I say.                                _Enter Cupbearer_.        _Sar._ (_addressing the Cupbearer_).      Bring me the golden goblet thick with gems,      Which bears the name of Nimrod's chalice. Hence,                   160      Fill full, and bear it quickly.                     [_Exit Cupbearer_.        _Sal._                         Is this moment      A fitting one for the resumption of      Thy yet unslept-off revels?                         _Re-enter Cupbearer, with wine_.        _Sar._ (_taking the cup from him_). Noble kinsman,      If these barbarian Greeks of the far shores      And skirts of these our realms lie not, this Bacchus      Conquered the whole of India,[8] did he not?        _Sal._ He did, and thence was deemed a Deity.[f]        _Sar._ Not so:--of all his conquests a few columns.[9]      Which may be his, and might be mine, if I      Thought them worth purchase and conveyance, are                    170      The landmarks of the seas of gore he shed,      The realms he wasted, and the hearts he broke.      But here--here in this goblet is his title      To immortality--the immortal grape      From which he first expressed the soul, and gave      To gladden that of man, as some atonement      For the victorious mischiefs he had done.      Had it not been for this, he would have been      A mortal still in name as in his grave;      And, like my ancestor Semiramis,                                   180      A sort of semi-glorious human monster.      Here's that which deified him--let it now      Humanise thee; my surly, chiding brother,      Pledge me to the Greek God!        _Sal._                      For all thy realms      I would not so blaspheme our country's creed.        _Sar._ That is to say, thou thinkest him a hero,      That he shed blood by oceans; and no God,      Because he turned a fruit to an enchantment,      Which cheers the sad, revives the old, inspires      The young, makes Weariness forget his toil,                        190      And Fear her danger; opens a new world      When this, the present, palls. Well, then _I_ pledge thee      And _him_ as a true man, who did his utmost      In good or evil to surprise mankind.                        [_Drinks_.        _Sal._ Wilt thou resume a revel at this hour?        _Sar._ And if I did, 'twere better than a trophy,      Being bought without a tear. But that is not      My present purpose: since thou wilt not pledge me,      Continue what thou pleasest.      (_To the Cupbearer_.)       Boy, retire.            [_Exit Cupbearer_.        _Sal._ I would but have recalled thee from thy dream;              200      Better by me awakened than rebellion.        _Sar._ Who should rebel? or why? what cause? pretext?      I am the lawful King, descended from      A race of Kings who knew no predecessors.      What have I done to thee, or to the people,      That thou shouldst rail, or they rise up against me?        _Sal._ Of what thou hast done to me, I speak not.        _Sar._                                             But      Thou think'st that I have wronged the Queen: is't not so?        _Sal._ _Think!_ Thou hast wronged her!        _Sar._                                 Patience, Prince, and hear me.      She has all power and splendour of her station,                    210      Respect, the tutelage of Assyria's heirs,      The homage and the appanage of sovereignty.      I married her as monarchs wed--for state,      And loved her as most husbands love their wives.      If she or thou supposedst I could link me      Like a Chaldean peasant to his mate,      Ye knew nor me--nor monarchs--nor mankind.        _Sal._ I pray thee, change the theme: my blood disdains      Complaint, and Salemenes' sister seeks not      Reluctant love even from Assyria's lord!                           220      Nor would she deign to accept divided passion      With foreign strumpets and Ionian slaves.      The Queen is silent.        _Sar._               And why not her brother?        _Sal._ I only echo thee the voice of empires,      Which he who long neglects not long will govern.        _Sar._ The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur      Because I have not shed their blood, nor led them      To dry into the desert's dust by myriads,      Or whiten with their bones the banks of Ganges;      Nor decimated them with savage laws,                               230      Nor sweated them to build up Pyramids,      Or Babylonian walls.        _Sal._               Yet these are trophies      More worthy of a people and their prince      Than songs, and lutes, and feasts, and concubines,      And lavished treasures, and"]]]
