Her words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around  the dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before  the door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly  into the room.  He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a  general air of superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel,  vicious mouth.    \"There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,\" he said in an unctuous,  make-everything-easy voice.  \"I fancy that you have been misdirected.  Possibly if you tried farther down the street--\"    \"That will do; we have no time to waste,\" said my companion firmly.  \"You are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of  Baden and South America.  I am as sure of that as that my own name is  Sherlock Holmes.\"    Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his  formidable pursuer.  \"I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr.  Holmes,\" said he coolly.  \"When a man's conscience is easy you can't  rattle him.  What is your business in my house?\"    \"I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom  you brought away with you from Baden.\"    \"I'd be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be,\" Peters  answered coolly.  \"I've a bill against her for nearly a hundred  pounds, and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants  that the dealer would hardly look at.  She attached herself to Mrs.  Peters and me at Baden--it is a fact that I was using another name at  the time--and she stuck on to us until we came to London.  I paid her  bill and her ticket.  Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I  say, left these out-of-date jewels to pay her bills.  You find her, Mr.  Holmes, and I'm your debtor.\"    \"I MEAN to find her,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"I'm going through this  house till I do find her.\"    \"Where is your warrant?\"    Holmes half drew a revolver from his pocket.  \"This will have to serve  till a better one comes.\"    \"Why, you're a common burglar.\"    \"So you might describe me,\" said Holmes cheerfully.  \"My companion is  also a dangerous ruffian.  And together we are going through your  house.\"    Our opponent opened the door.    \"Fetch a policeman, Annie!\" said he.  There was a whisk of feminine  skirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.    \"Our time is limited, Watson,\" said Holmes.  \"If you try to stop us,  Peters, you will most certainly get hurt.  Where is that coffin which  was brought into your house?\"    \"What do you want with the coffin?  It is in use.  There is a body in  it.\"    \"I must see the body.\"    \"Never with my consent.\"    \"Then without it.\"  With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow to  one side and passed into the hall.  A door half opened stood  immediately before us.  We entered.  It was the dining-room. On the  table, under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying.  Holmes  turned up the gas and raised the lid.  Deep down in the recesses of the  coffin lay an emaciated figure.  The glare from the lights above beat  down upon an aged and withered face. By no possible process of cruelty,  starvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful  Lady Frances.  Holmes's face showed his amazement, and also his relief.    \"Thank God!\" he muttered.  \"It's someone else.\"    \"Ah, you've blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said  Peters, who had followed us into the room.    \"Who is the dead woman?\"    \"Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife's, Rose  Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary.  We  brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13 Firbank  Villas--mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes--and had her carefully  tended, as Christian folk should.  On the third day she  died--certificate says senile decay--but that's only the doctor's  opinion, and of course you know better.  We ordered her funeral to be  carried out by Stimson and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury  her at eight o'clock to-morrow morning.  Can you pick any hole in that,  Mr. Holmes?  You've made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to  it.  I'd give something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face  when you pulled aside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax  and only found a poor old woman of ninety.\"    Holmes's expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his  antagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.    \"I am going through your house,\" said he.    \"Are you, though!\" cried Peters as a woman's voice and heavy steps  sounded in the passage.  \"We'll soon see about that.  This way,  officers, if you please.  These men have forced their way into my  house, and I cannot get rid of them.  Help me to put them out.\"    A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway.  Holmes drew his card  from his case.    \"This is my name and address.  This is my friend, Dr. Watson.\"    \"Bless you, sir, we know you very well,\" said the sergeant, \"but you  can't stay here without a warrant.\"    \"Of course not.  I quite understand that.\"    \"Arrest him!\" cried Peters.    \"We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,\"  said the sergeant majestically, \"but you'll have to go, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.\"    A minute later we were in the street once more.  Holmes was as cool as  ever, but I was hot with anger and humiliation.  The sergeant had  followed us.    \"Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that's the law.\"    \"Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise.\"    \"I expect there was good reason for your presence there.  If there is  anything I can do--\"    \"It's a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house.  I  expect a warrant presently.\"    \"Then I'll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes.  If anything comes  along, I will surely let you know.\"    It was only nine o'clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at  once.  First we drove to Brixton Workhouse Infirmary, where we found  that it was indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some  days before, that they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former  servant, and that they had obtained permission to take her away with  them.  No surprise was expressed at the news that she had since died.    The doctor was our next goal.  He had been called in, had found the  woman dying of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had  signed the certificate in due form.  \"I assure you that everything was  perfectly normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter,\"  said he. Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious save that  for people of their class it was remarkable that they should have no  servant.  So far and no further went the doctor.    Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard.  There had been difficulties  of procedure in regard to the warrant.  Some delay was inevitable.  The  magistrate's signature might not be obtained until next morning.  If  Holmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it  acted upon.  So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the  sergeant, called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and  there in the windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left  it and none had entered.  We could but pray for patience and wait for  the morrow.    Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for  sleep.  I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted  together, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his  chair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution of the  mystery.  Several times in the course of the night I heard him prowling  about the house. Finally, just after I had been called in the morning,  he rushed into my room.  He was in his dressing-gown, but his pale,  hollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.    \"What time was the funeral?  Eight, was it not?\" he asked eagerly.  \"Well, it is 7:20 now.  Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any  brains that God has given me?  Quick, man, quick! It's life or death--a  hundred chances on death to one on life. I'll never forgive myself,  never, if we are too late!\"    Five minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down  Baker Street.  But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big  Ben, and eight struck as we tore down the Brixton Road.  But others  were late as well as we.  Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was  still standing at the door of the house, and even as our foaming horse  came to a halt the coffin, supported by three men, appeared on the  threshold.  Holmes darted forward and barred their way.    \"Take it back!\" he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the  foremost.  \"Take it back this instant!\"    \"What the devil do you mean?  Once again I ask you, where is your  warrant?\" shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the  farther end of the coffin.    \"The warrant is on its way.  The coffin shall remain in the house until  it comes.\"    The authority in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters  had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders.  \"Quick, Watson, quick!  Here is a screw-driver!\" he shouted as the  coffin was replaced upon the table. \"Here's one for you, my man!  A  sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute!  Ask no questions--work  away!  That's good!  Another! And another!  Now pull all together!  It's giving!  It's giving! Ah, that does it at last.\"    With a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid.  As we did so there  came from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform.  A body lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been  soaked in the narcotic.  Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the  statuesque face of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2349"],[0,"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot (#4)"],[1,"disturbed.  Let me describe  exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning.  It has  left an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.    The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness.  The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would  have been even more intolerable.  This might partly be due to the fact  that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table.  Beside it  sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting,  his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face  turned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of  terror which had marked the features of his dead sister.  His limbs  were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a  very paroxysm of fear.  He was fully clothed, though there were signs  that his dressing had been done in a hurry.  We had already learned  that his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him  in the early morning.    One realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic  exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the  moment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was tense  and alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with  eager activity.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round  the room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing  foxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around  and ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some  fresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud  ejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair,  out through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn,  sprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the  hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.  The lamp, which was an  ordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain  measurements upon its bowl.  He carefully scrutinized with his lens the  talc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some  ashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an  envelope, which he placed in his pocketbook.  Finally, just as the  doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the  vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.    \"I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\"  he remarked.  \"I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police,  but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give  the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom  window and to the sitting-room lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together  they are almost conclusive.  If the police would desire further  information I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And  now, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed  elsewhere.\"    It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that  they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation;  but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two  days.  During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and  dreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which  he undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to  where he had been.  One experiment served to show me the line of his  investigation.  He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one  which had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of  the tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the  vicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be  exhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant  nature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.    \"You will remember, Watson,\" he remarked one afternoon, \"that there is  a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have  reached us.  This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in  each case upon those who had first entered it.  You will recollect that  Mortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his  brother's house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell  into a chair? You had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was  so. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told  us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards  opened the window.  In the second case--that of Mortimer Tregennis  himself--you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room  when we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window.  That  servant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.  You will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each  case there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case, also,  there is combustion going on in the room--in the one case a fire, in  the other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit--as a  comparison of the oil consumed will show--long after it was broad  daylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three  things--the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness  or death of those unfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?\"    \"It would appear so.\"    \"At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.  We will suppose,  then, that something was burned in each case which produced an  atmosphere causing strange toxic effects.  Very good. In the first  instance--that of the Tregennis family--this substance was placed in  the fire.  Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry  fumes to some extent up the chimney.  Hence one would expect the  effects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there  was less escape for the vapour.  The result seems to indicate that it  was so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the  more sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that  temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of  the drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The facts,  therefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by  combustion.    \"With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in  Mortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance.  The  obvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp.  There, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the  edges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed.  Half of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\"    \"Why half, Holmes?\"    \"It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official  police force.  I leave them all the evidence which I found.  The poison  still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.  Now, Watson,  we will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open  our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of  society, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an  armchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to  do with the affair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I  knew my Watson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may  be the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door we  will leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other and to  bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming.  Is  that all clear?  Well, then, I take our powder--or what remains of  it--from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp.  So!  Now,  Watson, let us sit down and await developments.\"    They were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair before  I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous.  At the  very first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all  control.  A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told  me that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my  appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was  monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.  Vague shapes  swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning  of something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the  threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.  A freezing horror  took possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes  were protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather.  The turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap.  I tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was  my own voice, but distant and detached from myself.  At the same moment,  in some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had  a glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror--the  very look which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that  vision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength.  I dashed  from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched  through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down  upon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the  glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud  of terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the  mists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were  sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with  apprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific  experience which we had undergone.    \"Upon my word, Watson!\" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, \"I  owe you both my thanks and an apology.  It was an unjustifiable  experiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend.  I am  really very sorry.\"    \"You know,\" I"]]]
