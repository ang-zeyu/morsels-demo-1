The  companionship of books is unquestionably one of the greatest antidotes  to the ravages of time, and study is better than all medical formulas  for the prolongation of life.    The man who has resolved upon getting together a collection of  first-class books may not unreasonably be appalled at the difficulties  which stand in the way. And what, indeed, it may be asked, will become  of the hundreds and thousands of books which are now all the fashion?  How many will survive the levelling process of the next half a score of  years, and how few will be known, except to bibliographers, half a  century hence? The lessons of the past would aid us in arriving at some  sort of conclusion as regards the future, if we were inclined to indulge  in speculation of this vain character. It will, however, be interesting  to point out that of the 1,300 books printed before the beginning of the  sixteenth century, not more than 300 are of any importance to the  book-collector. Of the 50,000 published in the seventeenth century, not  more than perhaps fifty are now held in estimation; and of the 80,000  published in the eighteenth century not more than 300 are considered  worth reprinting, and not more than 500 are sought after.    In a curious little book, 'L'An 2440, revue s'il en fut jamais,'  published in Paris a century ago, there is a very quaint description of  the process by which, in an improved state of society, men would apply  themselves not to multiply books, but to gather knowledge. The sages of  the political millennium exhibited their stores of useful learning in a  cabinet containing a few hundred volumes. All the lumber of letters had  perished, or was preserved only in one or two public libraries for the  gratification of a few harmless dreamers that were tolerated in their  laborious idleness. This pleasant little picture, drawn by M. L. S.  Mercier, of the state of things five centuries hence, is in strong  contrast to the painful plethora of books of the present day. Dr.  Ingleby, the famous Shakespearian scholar, is credited with the idea of  establishing a society for the purpose of procuring books which no one  else would buy; but this society (the 'Syncretic Book-club') could not  have had any success if the vast quantities of unsaleable rubbish which  one meets with on every hand are to be taken into account. Doubtless Dr.  Ingleby would have included in his scope such books as Lord Lonsdale's  'Memoir of the Reign of James II.,' 1803, which fifty years ago sold for  5-1/2 guineas, but which, within the past few months, has declined to  two shillings!    There was a time when even old and unsaleable books had a commercial  value. Before the cheapening of paper, a second-hand bookseller had  always the paper-mill to fall back on, and the price then paid, L1 10s.  per cwt., was one inducement to dispose of folios and quartos which  remained year in and year out without a purchaser. The present price of  waste-paper is half a crown a hundredweight, so that the bookseller is  now practically shut out of this poor market. Indeed, an enterprising  bibliopole was lately offering 'useful old books,' etc., at 3s. 6d. per  cwt., free on the rails, provided not less than six hundredweight is  bought. 'To young beginners,' he states, 'these lots are great  bargains'; but whether he means young beginners in literature or young  beginners in trade, is an open question. In either case, 'useful old  books' at the price of waste-paper are a novelty. There is a certain  amount of danger in the wholesale destruction of books, for posterity  may place a high value, literary and commercial, on the very works which  are now consigned to the paper-mill. Unfortunately, posterity will not  pay booksellers' rent of to-day. Just as those books which have the  largest circulation are likely to become the rarest, so do those which  were at one time most commonly met with often, after the lapse of a few  decades, become difficult to obtain. In one of his 'Echoes' notes,  Mr. G. A. Sala tells us that, in the course of forty years'  bookstall-hunting, he has known a great number of books once common  become scarce and costly--_e.g._, Lawrence's 'Lectures on Man'; Walker's  'Analysis of Beauty'; Millingen's 'Curiosities of Medical Experience';  Beckford's 'Vathek' in French; Jeremy Bentham's works; and Harris's  'Hermes.' Possibly the disappearance of these and many other books may  be attributed to certain definite causes. For example, in the early  years of this century one of the commonest books at 1s. or 1s. 6d. was  Theobald's 'Shakespeare Restored'; but fifty years later it was a very  rare book. The interest in Shakespeare and his editors had become quite  wide-spread in literary circles, and literature in any way bearing on  the subject found ready purchasers.    Just as the disappearance of certain books sends their prices up  considerably in the market, so the unexpected appearance of others has  just the reverse effect. Until quite recently one of the scarcest of the  first editions of the writings of Charles Dickens was a thin octavo  pamphlet of seventy-one pages, entitled 'The Village Coquettes: a Comic  Opera. In two Acts. London: Richard Bentley, 1836.' So rare was this  book that very few collectors could boast the possession of it, and an  uncut example might always be sold for L30 or L40. About a year before  his death, Dickens was asked by Mr. Locker-Lampson whether he had a  copy; his reply was: 'No, and if I knew it was in my house, and if I  could not get rid of it in any other way, I would burn the wing of the  house where it was'--the words, no doubt, being spoken in jest. Not long  since, a mass of waste-paper from a printer's warehouse was returned to  the mills to be pulped, and would certainly have been destroyed had not  one of the workmen employed upon the premises caught sight of the name  of 'Charles Dickens' upon some of the sheets. The whole parcel was  carefully examined, and the searchers were rewarded by the discovery of  nearly a hundred copies of 'The Village Coquettes,' in quires, clean and  unfolded. These were passed into the market, and the price at once fell  to about L5. The most curious things turn up sometimes in a similar  manner. A little sixpenny bazaar book ('Two Poems,' by Elizabeth Barrett  and Robert Browning, 1854) was for a long time extremely rare, as much  as L3 or L4 being paid for it when it occurred for sale. Suddenly it  appeared in a bookseller's catalogue at 2s., and as every applicant  could have as many as he wanted, it then leaked out that the bookseller,  Mr. Herbert, had purchased about 100 copies with books which he purposed  sending to the mill. Even 'remainders' sometimes turn out to be little  gold-mines. The late Mr. Stibbs bought the 'remainder' of Keats's  'Endymion' at 4d. per copy. We do not know what he realized by this  investment, but their value for some years has been L4 and upwards.    [Illustration: _The late Henry Stevens, of Vermont._]    The subject of book-finds is one about which a volume might be written.  Every 'special' collector has his fund of book-hunting anecdotes and  incidents, for, where the rarity of a well-known book is common  property, there is not usually much excitement in running it to earth.  The fun may be said to begin when two or three people are known to be on  the hunt after a rare and little-known volume, whose interest is of a  special character. To take, as an illustration, one of the most  successful book-hunters of modern times, the late Henry Stevens, of  Vermont. Until Mr. Stevens created the taste for Americana among his  fellow-countrymen, very few collectors considered the subject worth  notice. And yet, in the space of a quarter of a century, he unearthed  more excessively rare and unique items than the wildest dreamer could  have supposed to exist. Books and pamphlets which were to be had for the  proverbial old song when he first came to this country quickly became  the objects of the keenest competition in the saleroom, and invariably  found buyers at extravagant prices. As an illustration, although not an  American item, we may mention that when a copy of the Mazarin Bible was  offered at Sotheby's in 1847, the competitors were an agent of Mr. James  Lenox (Stevens' client) and Sir Thomas Phillipps in person; the latter  went to L495, but the agent went L5 better, and secured the prize at the  then unheard-of price of L500. At first Mr. Lenox declined to take the  book, but eventually altered his mind, wisely as it proved, for although  at long intervals copies are being unearthed, the present value of Mr.  Lenox's copy cannot be much short of L4,000. During 1854 and 1855 Mr.  Stevens bought books to the value of over 50,000 dollars for Mr. Lenox,  and on reviewing the invoices of these two years, 'I am confident,' says  Mr. Stevens, 'that, if the same works were now' (1887) 'to be collected,  they would cost more than 250,000 dollars. But can so much and so many  rare books ever be collected again in that space of time?' In December,  1855, Mr. Stevens offered Mr. Lenox in one lump about forty Shakespeare  quartos, all in good condition, and some of them very fine, for L500,  or, including a fair set of the four folios, L600, an offer which was  accepted, and it may be doubted whether such a set could now be  purchased for L6,000. Mr. Lenox was for over ten years desirous of  obtaining a perfect copy of 'The Bay Psalter,' printed by Stephen Daye  at Cambridge, New England, 1640, the first book printed in what is now  the United States, and had given Mr. Stevens a commission of L100 for  it. After searching far and wide, the long-lost 'Benjamin' was  discovered in a lot at the sale of Pickering's stock at Sotheby's in  1855. 'A cold-blooded coolness seized me, and advancing towards the  table behind Mr. Lilly, I quietly bid, in a perfectly neutral tone,  \"Sixpence\"; and so the bids went on,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#4)"],[1,", Lewes'  Goethe, etc.    4. Of notable essays, a high class of literature in which there are many  names, may be named Addison, Montaigne, Bacon, Goldsmith, Emerson, Lamb,  De Quincey, Holmes, Lowell, etc.    5. Poetry stands at the head of all the literature of imagination. Some  people of highly utilitarian views decry poetry, and desire to feed all  readers upon facts. But that this is a great mistake will be apparent  when we consider that the highest expressions of moral and intellectual  truth and the most finely wrought examples of literature in every nation  are in poetic form. Take out of the world's literature the works of its  great poets, and you would leave it poor indeed. Poetry is the only great  source for the nurture of imagination, and without imagination man is a  poor creature. I read the other day a dictum of a certain writer,  alleging that Dickens's Christmas Carol is far more effective as a piece  of writing than Milton's noble ode \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity.\"  Such comparisons are of small value. In point of fact, no library can  spare either of them. I need not repeat the familiar names of the great  poets; they are found in all styles of production, and some of the best  are among the least expensive.    6. Travels and voyages form a very entertaining as well as highly  instructive part of a library. A good selection of the more notable will  prove a valuable resource to readers of nearly every age.    7. The wide field of science should be carefully gleaned for a good range  of approved text-books in each department. So progressive is the modern  world that the latest books are apt to be the best in each science,  something which is by no means true in literature.    8. In law, medicine, theology, political science, sociology, economics,  art, architecture, music, eloquence, and language, the library should be  provided with the leading modern works.    9. We come now to fiction, which the experience of all libraries shows is  the favorite pabulum of about three readers out of four. The great demand  for this class of reading renders it all the more important to make a  wise and improving selection of that which forms the minds of multitudes,  and especially of the young. This selection presents to every librarian  and library director or trustee some perplexing problems. To buy  indiscriminately the new novels of the day, good, bad, and indifferent  (the last named greatly predominating) would be a very poor discharge of  the duty devolving upon those who are the responsible choosers of the  reading of any community. Conceding, as we must, the vast influence and  untold value of fiction as a vehicle of entertainment and instruction,  the question arises--where can the line be drawn between the good and  improving novels, and novels which are neither good nor improving? This  involves something more than the moral tone and influence of the  fictions: it involves their merits and demerits as literature also. I  hold it to be the bounden duty of those who select the reading of a  community to maintain a standard of good taste, as well as of good  morals. They have no business to fill the library with wretched models of  writing, when there are thousand of good models ready, in numbers far  greater than they have money to purchase. Weak and flabby and silly books  tend to make weak and flabby and silly brains. Why should library guides  put in circulation such stuff as the dime novels, or \"Old Sleuth\"  stories, or the slip-slop novels of \"The Duchess,\" when the great masters  of romantic fiction have endowed us with so many books replete with  intellectual and moral power? To furnish immature minds with the  miserable trash which does not deserve the name of literature, is as  blameworthy as to put before them books full of feverish excitement, or  stories of successful crime.    We are told, indeed (and some librarians even have said it) that for  unformed readers to read a bad book is better than to read none at all.  I do not believe it. You might as well say that it is better for one to  swallow poison than not to swallow any thing at all. I hold that library  providers are as much bound to furnish wholesome food for the minds of  the young who resort to them for guidance, as their parents are to  provide wholesome food for their bodies.    But the question returns upon us--what is wholesome food? In the first  place, it is that great body of fiction which has borne the test, both of  critical judgment, and of popularity with successive generations of  readers. It is the novels of Scott, Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, George  Eliot, Cooper, Hawthorne, Kingsley, Mulock-Craik, and many more, such as  no parents need blush to put into the hands of their daughters. In the  next place, it is such a selection from the myriads of stories that have  poured from the press of this generation as have been approved by the  best readers, and the critical judgment of a responsible press.    As to books of questionable morality, I am aware that contrary opinions  prevail on the question whether any such books should be allowed in a  public library, or not. The question is a different one for the small  town libraries and for the great reference libraries of the world. The  former are really educational institutions, supported at the people's  expense, like the free schools, and should be held to a responsibility  from which the extensive reference libraries in the city are free. The  latter may and ought to preserve every form of literature, and, if  national libraries, they would be derelict in their duty to posterity if  they did not acquire and preserve the whole literature of the country,  and hand it down complete to future generations. The function of the  public town library is different. It must indispensably make a selection,  since its means are not adequate to buy one-tenth of the annual product  of the press, which amounts in only four nations (England, France,  Germany, and the United States) to more than thirty-five thousand new  volumes a year. Its selection, mainly of American and English books, must  be small, and the smaller it is, the greater is the need of care in  buying. In fact, it is in most cases, compelled to be a selection from a  selection. Therefore, in the many cases of doubt arising as to the fit  character of a book, let the doubt be resolved in favor of the fund, thus  preserving the chance of getting a better book for the money.    With this careful and limited selection of the best, out of the multitude  of novels that swarm from the press, the reading public will have every  reason to be satisfied. No excuse can be alleged for filling up our  libraries with poor books, while there is no dearth whatever of good  ones. It is not the business of a public library to compete with the news  stands or the daily press in furnishing the latest short stories for  popular consumption; a class of literature whose survival is likely to be  quite as short as the stories themselves.    Take an object lesson as to the mischiefs of reading the wretched stuff  which some people pretend is \"better than no reading at all\" from the boy  Jesse Pomeroy, who perpetrated a murder of peculiar atrocity in Boston.  \"Pomeroy confessed that he had always been a great reader of 'blood and  thunder' stories, having read probably sixty dime novels, all treating of  scalping and deeds of violence. The boy said that he had no doubt that  the reading of those books had a great deal to do with his course, and he  would advise all boys to leave them alone.\"    In some libraries, where the pernicious effect of the lower class of  fiction has been observed, the directors have withdrawn from circulation  a large proportion of the novels, which had been bought by reason of  their popularity. In other newly started libraries only fiction of the  highest grade has been placed in the library from the start, and this is  by far the best course. If readers inquire for inferior or immoral books,  and are told that the library does not have them, although they will  express surprise and disappointment, they will take other and improving  reading, thus fulfilling the true function of the library as an educator.  Librarians and library boards cannot be too careful about what  constitutes the collection which is to form the pabulum of so many of the  rising generation.    This does not imply that they are to be censors, or prudes, but with the  vast field of literature before them from which to choose, they are bound  to choose the best.    The American Library Association has had this subject under discussion  repeatedly, and while much difference of opinion has arisen from the  difficulty of finding any absolute standard of excellence, nearly all  have agreed that as to certain books, readers should look elsewhere than  to the public free library for them. At one time a list of authors was  made out, many of whose works were deemed objectionable, either from  their highly sensational character, or their bad style, or their highly  wrought and morbid pictures of human passions, or their immoral tendency.  This list no doubt will surprise many, as including writers whose books  everybody, almost, has read, or has been accustomed to think well of. It  embraces the following popular authors, many of whose novels have had a  wide circulation, and that principally through popular libraries.    Here follow the names:    Mary J. Holmes, Mrs. Henry Wood, C. L. Hentz, M. P. Finley, Mrs. A. S.  Stephens, E. D. E. N. Southworth, Mrs. Forrester, Rhoda Broughton, Helen  Mathers, Jessie Fothergill, M. E. Braddon, Florence Marryat, Ouida,  Horatio Alger, Mayne Reid, Oliver Optic, W. H. S. Kingston, E. Kellogg,  G. W. M. Reynolds, C. Fosdick, Edmund Yates, G. A. Lawrence, Grenville  Murray, W. H. Ainsworth, Wilkie Collins, E. L. Bulwer-Lytton, W. H.  Thomes, and Augusta Evans Wilson.    Bear in mind, that only"]]]
