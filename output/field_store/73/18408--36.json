On Feb. 10 the Lord Keeper ordered that on the      following Saturday the Warden of the Fleet should cut a hole through      the replication, and put the plaintiff's head through the hole and      let it hang about his shoulders with the written side outwards, and      lead the plaintiff bareheaded and barefaced round about Westminster      Hall, and show him at the bar of all the courts, and so back to the      Fleet.--Abridged from Spence's _Equitable Jurisdiction_, vol. i. p.      376.]        'Gainst Weldon Mylward files a bill,      But doth his replication fill      With scandalous and idle matter,      That would disgrace the maddest hatter.                          Woe is me for Mylward!        'Twas sixscore sheets, it might have been      Contained, and amply, in sixteen;      So after that the court hath risen      Must Mylward Fleetward go to prison.

The pleading writ with words so fair      Must Mylward like a tabard wear,      A hole therein, the Warden cuts it,      A head put through it, Mylward puts it.                          Woe is me for Mylward!        The bar makes merry at his shame;      What careth he? He winneth fame,      Three hundred years his reputation      Hath rested on that replication.                          Woe is me for Mylward!      HAMPDEN _v._ WALSH    (1 Queen's Bench Division, 189)        \"Five hundred pounds as stake I'll lay,\"      Says Hampden, \"that by such a day      No man of science proves to me      That earth not flat but round must be;      The earth is flat, and flats are they.\"      The sum Walsh holds right willingly;      But Wallace by philosophy      Proves roundness, and would take away              Five hundred pounds.        \"Proof me no proofs,\" quoth Hampden, \"Nay,      Let Wallace get it if he may,      I'll sue Walsh for it.\" So sues he.      \"Let Wallace,\" hold the judges three,      \"Take nought, let Walsh to Hampden pay              Five hundred pounds.\"      WILLIS _v._ THE BISHOP OF OXFORD    (2 Probate Division, 192)        Aid me, Muses! my endeavour is to sing a woful song,      How a very learned bishop in the Arches Court went wrong.      Aid me, for _duplex querela_ is an uninviting theme,      And the practice of the Arches raises no poetic dream.      'Tis the Reverend Child Willis, child in name but not in age,      Comes he to the Court of Arches burning with a noble rage,      Filing his _duplex querela_, claiming for himself thereby      Vicarage of Drayton Parslow, or to know the reason why.      \"Reason why?\" the bishop answers; \"that is not so far to seek.      Little Latin have you, Willis, innocent are you of Greek.      You were specially examined by my good Archdeacon Pott;      He reported to me promptly, 'Greek and Latin all forgot,      _Non idoneus_ is Willis, _minus et sufficiens_,      He may have a _sanum corpus_, but he lacks a _sana mens_.'\"      \"Nay,\" says Willis, \"such an answer is but trifling with the court,      I have preached a Latin sermon, and the classics are my forte,      You must name the books I failed in, you must give me every chance      Of a fresh examination at the hands of Lord Penzance.\"      Lord Penzance supported Willis: \"Bishop, you must file,\" said he,      \"Some more tangible objection, some less vague and general plea.      As it stands I cannot gather what it is you ploughed him in,      Whether Hellenistic aorists or the Latin word for sin.\"      But alas! the world has never known as yet what Willis did,      In the breast of the Archdeacon still it lies a secret hid.      Was his Latin prose defective? Did his style of writing show      More resemblance to Tertullian than to Tullius Cicero?      Were his dates a little shaky? Could it, could it be that he      Confidently made Augustine flourish at a date B.C.?      None will know save Pott, Archdeacon, for alas! the patroness      Showed no mercy to Child Willis in the day of his distress.      She revoked the presentation, leaving Willis in the lurch,      One of undisputed learning preached in Drayton Parslow church.      Doubly barren was his triumph, it was not a twelve-month ere      Death set up _his_ Court of Arches, Willis did not triumph there.      DASHWOOD _v._ JERMYN    (12 Chancery Division, 776)        Captain Dashwood, who had been      In the service of the Queen,      Sick of \"Eyes front\" and \"Attention,\"      Came to London on his pension.      At the \"Portland\" as he stayed,      Firm the friendship that he made      With one William Richards, who      Put up at the \"Portland\" too.      Passed six years, then he was wrapped in      Love's embraces, vanquished captain!      \"Yes,\" he cried, \"I will; no bar shall      Stop my wedding Edith Marshall.\"      But there was a bar, 'twas that      He was poorer than a rat;      Indian pensions do not run      More than just enough for one.      Edith, too, had not a cent,      Who would pay the rates and rent?      Two more years, and Richards moved      (He perchance had sometime loved),      Promised them an income clear,      'Twas five hundred pounds a year      For his life; when he was dead,      Then ten thousand pounds instead.      This to Dashwood in a letter      Wrote he, deeming it was better      They should marry soon while he      Lived their happiness to see.      'Twas a modest sum, but marriage      May be blest without a carriage,      Forty pounds a month and more      Keep the wolf from near the door.      So they wed for worse or better,      On the faith of Richards' letter.      Scarcely was a quarter's payment      Due when mourning was their raiment.      Richards died. Alas! no cash would      Find its way to Captain Dashwood.      Dashwood's head began to swim--      Not a shilling left to him!      \"Ha, I'll have it still,\" cried he;      \"Justice dwells in Chancery.\"      So the case was straightway taken      To the court of V.-C. Bacon.      Vainly Dashwood cash expended      The executors defended,      Claiming that what Richards wrote      Was not worth a five-pound note;      First because the dead testator      Well, not wisely, loved the \"cratur,\"      More than that, had often been      In delirium tremens seen;      Secondly, because he signed      When he did not know his mind;      Third, because pollicitation      Is not good consideration.      Law, of justice independent,      Gave its judgment for defendant.      Poorer than he was at first,      That unhappy plaintiff cursed,      With a special satisfaction      Cursed the day he brought his action.      Would that he'd in India tarried!      Would that he had never married!      He, alas, is tied for life      Pauper to a pauper wife,      Scarce consoled that on his name      Equity reports shower fame,      Bearing down to endless ages      Dashwood's story on their pages.      _EX PARTE_ JONES    (18 Chancery Division, 109)        Oh for the wily infant who married the widow and made      Profit of coke and of breeze, and never a penny he paid!      Oh for the Corporation of Birmingham cheated and snared,      Taking orders for coke that the widow and infant prepared!      Oh for the Court of Appeal, and oh for Lords Justices three!      Oh for the Act that infants from contracts may shake themselves free!      Oh for the common law with its store of things old and new!      Birmingham coke is good and good Coke upon Littleton too.      FINLAY _v._ CHIRNEY    (20 Queen's Bench Division, 494)        When love-sick man descends to folly        And gets engaged, he must not stray,      The jury takes the part of Polly,        And if he jilts her, he must pay.

Thus the range of his connections and  relationships widened from year to year, and when he travelled again  it was an ever-widening audience that waited for his impressions and  observations.    In a book of reprinted feuilletons of Herzl which appeared in the  first years of his success as a journalist a total of seven or eight  lines is devoted to Jews. His impressions of the Ghetto in Rome. \"What  a steaming in the air, what a street! Countless open doors and windows  thronged with innumerable pallid and worn-out faces. The ghetto! With  what base and persistent hatred these unfortunates have been  persecuted for the sole crime of faithfulness to their religion. We've  travelled a long way since those times: nowadays the Jew is despised  only for having a crooked nose, or for being a plutocrat even when he  happens to be a pauper.\" Pity and bitterness abound in these lines,  but they are written by a detached spectator. He did not know how much  of the Jew there was in him even in this feeling of remoteness from a  world which offered him not living reality but folly.    By 1892, Herzl had achieved great success as a dramatist and as a  journalist; his plays had been performed on the stage of the leading  theatre of Vienna and, to cap the climax, came an appointment to the  staff of the _Neue Freie Presse_, one of the most distinguished papers  on the continent.    Early in October he received a telegram from the _Neue Freie Presse_  asking whether he would accept the post of Paris correspondent. He  replied at once in the affirmative, and proceeded to the French  capital at the end of the same month. He wrote to his parents: \"The  position of Paris correspondent is the springboard to great things,  and I shall achieve them, to your great joy, my dear beloved parents.\"    Herzl sustained successfully the comparison with his great models and  predecessors. In style as well as in substance his reports and  articles were masterpieces of their kind. He came to his task with the  equipment of a perfect feuilletonist; his style was polished and  musical; he possessed in an exceptional degree the capacity to  describe natural scenery in a few fine clear strokes and of hinting  at, rather than of reproducing, a mood with a minimum of language.  Everything was there, background, mood and development of action in  plastic balance. It was only now, when a great opportunity provoked  him to the highest effort, that all the lessons of the years of his  apprenticeship built up a many-sided perfection.    He threw himself seriously and diligently into the journalistic craft.  He observed with close attention all that went on about him, and  listened with sharpened ears. But the moment had not yet come for the  unveiling of a mission within him. He was on the way; the process of  preparation had begun.    How, in this mood of his, could he possibly have avoided clashing with  the Jewish question? As far back as the time of his Spanish journey,  when he had sought healing from his domestic and spiritual torments,  the question had presented itself to him and had cried for artistic  expression. His call to Paris had been a welcome pretext, perhaps,  putting off the writing of his Jewish novel--the more so as he  probably was not ripe enough for such an undertaking. Now that he was  in Paris, where his eyes were opened to the full range of the social  process, he began to draw nearer in spirit to his fellow-Jews, and to  look upon them more warmly and with less inhibition. He found them as  difficult aesthetically as before, but he tried hard to grasp the  essence of their character and substance, and to judge them without  prejudice.    When Herzl arrived in Paris anti-Semitism, had not--in spite of  Drumont's exertions, and in spite of his paper, _la Libre Parole_,  founded in 1892--achieved the dimensions of a genuine movement, nor  was it destined to become one in the German sense. But it served as  the focus for all kinds of discontents and resentments; it attracted  certain serious critical spirits, too; its influence grew from day to  day, and the position of the Jews became increasingly uncomfortable.    Herzl's contact with anti-Semitism dated back to his student days,  when it had first taken on the form of a social political movement. He  had been aware of it as a writer, though the contact had never ripened  into a serious inner struggle or compelled him to give utterance to  it.    Now he read Drumont, as he had read Duehring. The impression was again  a profound one. What moved him most in the work was the totality of a  world picture based on a considered hostility to the Jews.    A ritual-murder trial was in progress in the town of Xanten, in the  Rhineland. On August 31, 1892, Herzl, dealing with this subject as  with all other subjects of public interest, summed up the general  situation in a long report entitled \"French anti-Semitism.\"    By now Herzl was no longer content with a simple acceptance of the  facts; he was looking for the deeper significance of the universal  enmity directed against the Jews. For the world it is a lightning  conductor. But so far it was only a flash of insight which ended in  nothing more than a literary paradox. However, from now on it gave him  no peace.    At the turn of the year 1892-93 there came a sharp clarification in  his ideas. He had followed closely the evasive debates in the Austrian  Reichstag--debates which forever dodged the reality by turning the  question into one of religion. \"It is no longer--and it has not been  for a long time--a theological matter. It has nothing whatsoever to do  with religion and conscience,\" declared Herzl. \"What is more, everyone  knows it. The Jewish question is neither nationalistic nor religious.  It is a social question.\"    Then came the summer, 1894, and at its close Herzl took a much needed  vacation. He spent the month of September in Baden, near Vienna, in  the company of his fellow-feuilletonist on the _Neue Freie Presse_,  Ludwig Speidel. Herzl has left a record of their conversation. What he  gave Speidel was more or less what he had felt, many years before,  after his reading of Duehring. He admitted the substance of the  anti-Semitic accusation which linked the Jew with money; he defended  the Jew as the victim of a long historic process for which the Jew was  not responsible. \"It is not our fault, not the fault of the Jews, that  we find ourselves forced into the role of alien bodies in the midst of  various nations. The ghetto, which was not of our making, bred in us  certain anti-social qualities.... Our original character cannot have  been other than magnificent and proud; we were men who knew how to  face war and how to defend the state; had we not started out with such  gifts, how could we have survived two thousand years of unrelenting  persecution?\"    At that time Herzl came across the Zionist solution, and definitely  rejected it. Discussing the novel _Femme de Claude_, by Dumas the  younger, he says of one of its characters: \"The good Jew Daniel wants  to rediscover the homeland of his race and gather his scattered  brothers into it. But a man like Daniel would surely know that the  historic homeland of the Jews no longer has any value for them. It is  childish to go in search of the geographic location of this homeland.  And if the Jews really 'returned home' one day, they would discover  on the next day that they do not belong together. For centuries they  have been rooted in diverse nationalisms; they differ from each other,  group by group; the only thing they have in common is the pressure  which holds them together. All humiliated peoples have Jewish  characteristics, and as soon as the pressure is removed they react  like liberated men.\"    The inner apotheosis was drawing nearer and nearer for Herzl. In  October, 1894, Herzl was in the studio of the sculptor, Samuel  Friedrich Beer, who was making a bust of him. The conversation turned  to the Jewish question and to the growth of the anti-Semitic movement  in Vienna, the hometown of both Herzl and Beer. It was useless for the  Jew to turn artist and to dissociate himself from money, said Herzl.  \"The blot sticks. We can't break away from the ghetto.\" A great  excitement seized Herzl, and he left the atelier, and on the way home  the inspiration came on him like a hammerblow. What was it? The  complete outline of a play, \"like a block of basalt.\"    With this play Herzl completed his inner return to his people. Until  then, with all his emotional involvement in the question, he had stood  outside it as the observer, the student, the clarifier, or even the  defender. He had provided the world-historic background for the  problem, he had diagnosed it and given the prognosis for the future.  Now he was immersed in it and identified with it.    He had become its spokesman and attorney, as he was spokesman and  attorney for other victims of injustice. It was no accident that the  hero of the play was a lawyer by vocation and avocation. For the hero  was Herzl himself, and the transformation which unfolded in Dr. Jacob  Samuel was the transformation which was unfolding in Theodore Herzl.    He belongs utterly to the Jews; it is for them that he fights, and,  dying, he still sees himself as the fighter for their future. What  future Jacob Samuel foresaw for the Jews in his dying moments remained  unclear. It would appear that Herzl himself still believed that a  deepening of mutual understanding between Jews and non-Jews might  bring the solution.    But Herzl had travelled so much further by this time that he could not  have in mind the \"reconciliation\" which would come by the capitulation  of baptism. Indeed, the play emphasizes as a first prerequisite in  human relations the element of self-respect. \"If you become untrue to  yourself,\" says the clever mother to"]]]
