'The fact is,' said the Fireman, 'that owing to the size of this helmet  I can't see where it is; but if you will kindly glance at the  surrounding district, you'll see it about somewhere.'    They glanced about and, sure enough, there was a fire burning in the  next field. It was only a cowshed, certainly, but it was blazing very  nicely, and well worth looking at.    'Fire,' said Bill, 'in the form of a common cowshed, is burnin' about  nor'-nor'-east as the crow flies.'    'In that case,' said the Fireman, 'I invite all present bravely to  assist in putting it out. But,' he added impressively, 'if you'll take  my advice, you'll shove that Puddin' in this hollow log and roll a  stone agen the end to keep him in, for if he gets too near the flames  he'll be cooked again and have his flavour ruined.'    [Illustration]    'This is a very sensible feller,' said Bill, and though Puddin' objected  strongly, he was at once pushed into a log and securely fastened in with  a large stone.    [Illustration]    'How'd you like to be shoved in a blooming log,' he shouted at Bill,  'when you was burning with anxiety to see the fire?' but Bill said  severely, 'Be sensible, Albert, fires is too dangerous to Puddin's  flavours.'    No more time was lost in seizing the hose and they set off with the  greatest enthusiasm. For, as everyone knows, running with the reel is  one of the grand joys of being a fireman. They had the hose fixed to a  garden tap in no time, and soon were all hard at work, putting out the  fire.    [Illustration]    Of course there was a great deal of smoke and shouting, and getting  tripped up by the hose, and it was by the merest chance Bunyip Bluegum  glanced back in time to see the Wombat in the act of stealing the  Puddin' from the hollow log.    'Treachery is at work,' he shouted.    'Treachery,' roared Bill, and with one blow on the snout knocked the  Fireman endways on into the burning cinders, where his helmet fell off,  and exposed the countenance of that snooting, snouting scoundrel, the  Possum.    The Possum, of course, hadn't expected to have his disguise pierced so  swiftly, and, though he managed to scramble out of the fire in time to  save his bacon, he was considerably singed down the back.    'What a murderous attack!' he exclaimed. 'O, what a brutal attempt to  burn a man alive!' and as some hot cinders had got down his back he gave  a sharp yell and ran off, singeing and smoking. Bill, distracted with  rage, ran after the Possum, then changed his mind and ran after the  Wombat, so that, what with running first after one and then after the  other, they both had time to get clean away, and disappeared over the  skyline.    'I see it all,' shouted Bill, casting himself down in despair. 'Them low  puddin'-thieves has borrowed a fireman's helmet, collared a hose, an'  set fire to a cowshed in order to lure us away from the Puddin'.'    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    'The whole thing's a low put-up job on our noble credulity,' said Sam,  casting himself down beside Bill.    'It's one of the most frightful things that's ever happened,' said Bill.    'It's worse than treading on tacks with bare feet,' said Sam.    'It's worse than bein' caught stealin' fowls,' said Bill.    'It's worse than bein' stood on by cows,' said Sam.    [Illustration]    'It's almost as bad as havin' an uncle called Aldobrantifoscofornio,'  said Bill, and they both sang loudly--      'It's worse than weevils, worse than warts,      It's worse than corns to bear.    It's worse than havin' several quarts      Of treacle in your hair.      'It's worse than beetles in the soup,      It's worse than crows to eat.    It's worse than wearin' small-sized boots      Upon your large-sized feet.      'It's worse than kerosene to boose,      It's worse than ginger hair.    It's worse than anythin' to lose      A Puddin' rich and rare.'    [Illustration]    Bunyip Bluegum reproved this despondency, saying, 'Come, come, this is  no time for giving way to despair. Let us, rather, by the fortitude of  our bearing prove ourselves superior to this misfortune and, with the  energy of justly enraged men, pursue these malefactors, who have so  richly deserved our vengeance. Arise!'    'Bravely spoken,' said Bill, immediately recovering from despair.      'The grass is green, the day is fair,      The dandelions abound.    Is this a time for sad despair      And sitting on the ground?      'Our Puddin' in some darksome lair      In iron chains is bound,    While puddin'-snatchers on him fare,      And eat him by the pound.      'Let gloom give way to angry glare,      Let weak despair be drowned,    Let vengeance in its rage declare      Our Puddin' must be found.      'Then let's resolve to do and dare.      Let teeth with rage be ground.    Let voices to the heavens declare      Our Puddin' MUST be found.'    'Those gallant words have fired our blood,' said Sam, and they both  shook hands with Bunyip, to show that they were now prepared to follow  the call of vengeance.    'In order to investigate this dastardly outrage,' said Bunyip, 'we must  become detectives, and find a clue. We must find somebody who has seen a  singed possum. Once traced to their lair, mother-wit will suggest some  means of rescuing our Puddin'.'    They set off at once, and, after a brisk walk, came to a small house  with a signboard on it saying, 'Henderson Hedgehog, Horticulturist'.  Henderson himself was in the garden, horticulturing a cabbage, and they  asked him if he had chanced to see a singed possum that morning.    'What's that? What, what?' said Henderson Hedgehog, and when they had  repeated the question, he said, 'You must speak up, I'm a trifle deaf.'    'Have you seen a singed possum?' shouted Bill.    'I can't hear you,' said Henderson.    'Have you seen a SINGED POSSUM?' roared Bill.    'To be sure,' said Henderson, 'but the turnips are backward.'    'Turnips be stewed,' yelled Bill in such a tremendous voice that he blew  his own hat off. 'HAVE YOU SEEN A SINGED POSSUM?'    'Good season for wattle blossom,' said Henderson. 'Well, yes, but a very  poor season for carrots.'    'A man might as well talk to a carrot as try an' get sense out of this  runt of a feller,' said Bill, disgusted. 'Come an' see if we can't find  someone that it won't bust a man's vocal cords gettin' information out  of.'    They left Henderson to his horticulturing and walked on till they met a  Parrot who was a Swagman, or a Swagman who was a Parrot. He must have  been one or the other, if not both, for he had a bag and a swag, and a  beak, and a billy, and a thundering bad temper into the bargain, for the  moment Bill asked him if he had met a singed possum he shouted back--    'Me eat a singed possum! I wouldn't eat a possum if he was singed,  roasted, boiled, or fried.'    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    'Not ett--met,' shouted Bill. 'I said, met a singed possum.'    'Why can't yer speak plainly, then,' said the Parrot. 'Have you got a  fill of tobacco on yer?'    He took out his pipe and scowled at Bill.    'Here you are,' said Bill. 'Cut a fill an' answer the question.'    'All in good time,' said the Parrot, and he added to Sam, 'You got any  tobacco?'    Sam handed him a fill, and he put it in his pocket. 'You ain't got any  tobacco,' he said scornfully to Bunyip Bluegum. 'I can see that at a  glance. You're one of the non-smoking sort, all fur and feathers.'    'Here,' said Bill angrily. 'Enough o' this beatin' about the bush.  Answer the question.'    'Don't be impatient,' said the Parrot. 'Have you got a bit o' tea an'  sugar on yer?'    'Here's yer tea an' sugar,' said Bill, handing a little of each out of  the bag. 'And that's the last thing you get. Now will you answer the  question?'    'Wot question?' asked the Parrot.    'Have yer seen a singed possum?' roared Bill.    'No, I haven't,' said the Parrot, and he actually had the insolence to  laugh in Bill's face.    'Of all the swivel-eyed, up-jumped, cross-grained, sons of a cock-eyed  tinker,' exclaimed Bill, boiling with rage. 'If punching parrots on the  beak wasn't too painful for pleasure, I'd land you a sockdolager on the  muzzle that 'ud lay you out till Christmas. Come on, mates,' he added,  'it's no use wastin' time over this low-down, hook-nosed  tobacco-grabber.' And leaving the evil-minded Parrot to pursue his  evil-minded way, they hurried off in search of information.    The next person they spied was a Bandicoot carrying a watermelon. At a  first glance you would have thought it was merely a watermelon walking  by itself, but a second glance would have shown you that the walking was  being done by a small pair of legs attached to the watermelon, and a  third glance would have disclosed that the legs were attached to a  Bandicoot.    They shouted, 'Hi, you with the melon!' to attract his attention, and  set off running after him, and the Bandicoot, being naturally of a  terrified disposition, ran for all he was worth. He wasn't worth much as  a runner, owing to the weight of the watermelon, and they caught him up  half-way across the field.    [Illustration]    Conceiving that his hour had come, the Bandicoot gave a shrill squeak of  terror and fell on his knees.    'Take me watermelon,' he gasped,'but spare me life.'    'Stuff an' nonsense,' said Bill. 'We don't want your life. What we want  is some information. Have you seen a singed possum about this morning?'    'Singed possums, sir, yes sir, certainly sir,' gasped the Bandicoot,  trembling violently.    'What!' exclaimed Bill, 'do yer mean to say you have seen a singed  possum?'    'Singed possums, sir, yes sir,' gulped the Bandicoot. 'Very plentiful,  sir, this time of the year, sir, owing to the bush fires, sir.'    'Rubbish,' roared Bill. 'I don't believe he's seen a singed possum at  all.'    'No, sir,' quavered the Bandicoot.

So that in future  references, to avoid repetition, these groups will be referred to as  group 1, 2, and so on, as detailed here.          CHAPTER IV.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      B--CLEAVAGE.    By cleavage is meant the manner in which minerals separate or split off  with regularity. The difference between a break or fracture and a  \"cleave,\" is that the former may be anywhere throughout the substance of  the broken body, with an extremely remote chance of another fracture  being identical in form, whereas in the latter, when a body is  \"cleaved,\" the fractured part is more readily severed, and usually takes  a similar if not an actually identical form in the divided surface of  each piece severed. Thus we find a piece of wood may be \"broken\" or  \"chopped\" when fractured across the grain, no two fractured edges being  alike; but, strictly speaking, we only \"cleave\" wood when we \"split\" it  with the grain, or, in scientific language, along the line of cleavage,  and then we find many pieces with their divided surfaces identical. So  that when wood is \"broken,\" or \"chopped,\" we obtain pieces of any width  or thickness, with no manner of regularity of fracture, but when  \"cleaved,\" we obtain strips which are often perfectly parallel, that is,  of equal thickness throughout their whole length, and of such uniformity  of surface that it is difficult or even impossible to distinguish one  strip from another. Advantage is taken of these lines of cleavage to  procure long and extremely thin even strips from trees of the willow  variety for such trades as basket-making.    The same effect is seen in house-coal, which may easily be split the way  of the grain (on the lines of cleavage), but is much more difficult and  requires greater force to break across the grain. Rocks also show  distinct lines of cleavage, and are more readily split one way than  another, the line of cleavage or stratum of break being at any angle and  not necessarily parallel to its bed. A striking example of this is seen  in slate, which may be split in plates, or laminae, with great facility,  though this property is the result of the pressure to which the rock has  been for ages subjected, which has caused a change in the molecules,  rather than by \"cleavage\" as the term is strictly understood, and as  existing in minerals. Mica is also another example of laminated  cleavage, for given care, and a thin, fine knife to divide the plates,  this mineral may be \"cleaved\" to such remarkably thin sheets as to be  unable to sustain the most delicate touch without shattering.    These are well-known examples of simple cleavage, in one definite  direction, though in many instances there are several forms and  directions of cleavage, but even in these there is generally one part or  line in and on which cleavage will take place much more readily than on  the others, these planes or lines also showing different properties and  angular characters, which, no matter how much fractured, always remain  the same. It is this \"cleavage\" which causes a crystal to reproduce  itself exactly, as explained in the last chapter, showing its parent  form, shape and characteristics with microscopic perfection, but more  and more in miniature as its size is reduced.    This may clearly be seen by taking a very small quantity of such a  substance as chlorate of potash. If a crystal of this is examined under  a magnifying glass till its crystalline form and structure are familiar,  and it is then placed in a test-tube and gently heated, cleavage will at  once be evident. With a little crackling, the chlorate splits itself  into many crystals along its chief lines of cleavage (called the  cleavage planes), every one of which crystals showing under the  microscope the identical form and characteristics of the larger crystal  from which it came.    The cleavage of minerals must, therefore, be considered as a part of  their crystalline structure, since this is caused by cleavage, so that  both cleavage and crystalline structure should be considered together.  Thus we see that given an unchangeable crystal with cleavage planes  evident, it is possible easily to reproduce the same form over and over  again by splitting, whereas by simply breaking, the form of the crystal  would be lost; just as a rhomb of Iceland spar might be sawn or broken  across the middle and its form lost, although this would really be more  apparent than real, since it would be an alteration in the mass and not  in the shape of each individual crystal. And given further cleavage, by  time or a sudden breaking down, even the mass, as mass, would eventually  become split into smaller but perfect rhombs.    Much skill is, therefore, required in cutting and fashioning a precious  stone, otherwise the gem may be ruined at the onset, for it will only  divide along its lines of cleavage, and any mistake in deciding upon  these, would \"break,\" not \"split\" the stone, and destroy the beauty of  its crystalline structure. An example of this was specially seen in the  great Cullinan diamond, the splitting of which was perhaps the most  thrilling moment in the history of precious stones.[A] The value of the  enormous crystal was almost beyond computation, but it had a flaw in the  centre, and in order to cut out this flaw it was necessary to divide the  stone into two pieces. The planes of cleavage were worked out, the  diamond was sawn a little, when the operator, acknowledged to be the  greatest living expert, inserted a knife in the saw-mark, and with the  second blow of a steel rod, the marvellous stone parted precisely as  intended, cutting the flaw exactly in two, leaving half of it on the  outside of each divided portion. The slightest miscalculation would have  meant enormous loss, if not ruin, to the stone, but the greatest feat  the world has ever known in the splitting of a priceless diamond was  accomplished successfully by this skilful expert in an Amsterdam  workroom in February, 1908. Some idea of the risk involved may be  gathered from the fact that this stone, the largest ever discovered, in  the rough weighed nearly 3,254 carats, its value being almost anything  one cared to state--incalculable.    [Footnote A: The hammer and knife used in cutting the diamond, the two  largest pieces of which are now called \"The Stars of Africa,\" together  with a model of the great uncut stone, are in the Tower of London  amongst the Regalia.]    These cleavage planes help considerably in the bringing of the stone to  shape, for in a broad sense, a finished cut stone may be said to be in  the form in which its cleavages bring it. Particularly is this seen in  the diamond \"brilliant,\" which plainly evidences the four cleavage  planes. These cleavage planes and their number are a simple means of  identification of precious stones, though those possessing distinct and  ready cleavages are extremely liable to \"start\" or \"split\" on these  planes by extremes of heat and cold, accidental blows, sudden shocks and  the like.    In stones possessing certain crystalline structure, the cleavage planes  are the readiest, often the only, means of identification, especially  when the stones are chemically coloured to imitate a more valuable  stone. In such cases the cleavage of one stone is often of paramount  importance in testing the cleavage of another, as is seen in the  perfection of the cleavage planes of calcite, which is used in the  polariscope.    It sometimes happens, however, that false conditions arise, such as in  substances which are of no form or shape, and are in all respects and  directions without regular structure and show no crystallisation even in  the minutest particles; these are called amorphous. Such a condition  sometimes enters wholly or partially into the crystalline structure, and  the mineral loses its true form, possessing instead the form of  crystals, but without a crystalline structure. It is then called a  pseudomorph, which is a term applied to any mineral which, instead of  having the form it should possess, shows the form of something which has  altered its structure completely, and then disappeared. For instance:  very often, in a certain cavity, fluorspar has existed originally, but,  through some chemical means, has been slowly changed to quartz, so  that, as crystals cannot be changed in shape, we find quartz  existing--undeniably quartz--yet possessing the crystals of fluorspar;  therefore the quartz becomes a pseudomorph, the condition being an  example of what is termed pseudomorphism. The actual cause of this  curious chemical change or substitution is not known with certainty, but  it is interesting to note the conditions in which such changes do occur.    It is found that in some cases, the matrix of a certain shaped crystal  may, after the crystal is dissolved or taken away, become filled by some  other and foreign substance, perhaps in liquid form; or a crystalline  substance may become coated or \"invested\" by another foreign substance,  which thus takes its shape; or actual chemical change takes place by  means of an incoming substance which slowly alters the original  substance, so that eventually each is false and both become  pseudomorphs. This curious change often takes place with precious  stones, as well as with other minerals, and to such an extent that it  sometimes becomes difficult to say what the stone ought really to be  called.    Pseudomorphs are, however, comparatively easy of isolation and  detection, being more or less rounded in their crystalline form, instead  of having sharp, well-defined angles and edges; their surfaces also are  not good. These stones are of little value, except in the specially  curious examples, when they become rare more by reason of their  curiosity than by their utility as gems."]]]
