Between Narnaul and the south-east corner of the Bahawalpur  State the great Rajputana desert, mainly occupied in this quarter by  Bikaner, thrusts northwards a huge wedge reaching almost up to the  Sutlej. To the west of the wedge is Bahawalpur and to the east the  British district of Hissar. The apex is less than 100 miles from Lahore,  while a line drawn due south from that city to latitude 27'5 deg. north  would exceed 270 miles in length. The Jaipur State lies to the south and  west of Narnaul, while Gurgaon has across its southern frontiers Alwar  and Bharatpur, and near the Jamna the Muttra district of the United  Provinces.          CHAPTER II    MOUNTAINS, HILLS, AND PLAINS      ~The Great Northern Rampart.~--The huge mountain rampart which guards the  northern frontier of India thrusts out in the north-west a great bastion  whose outer walls are the Hindu Kush and the Muztagh-Karakoram ranges.  Behind the latter with a general trend from south-east to north-west are  the great valley of the Indus to the point near Gilgit where it turns  sharply to the south, and a succession of mountain chains and glens  making up the Himalayan tract, through which the five rivers of the  Panjab and the Jamna find their way to the plains. To meet trans-Indus  extensions of the Himalaya the Hindu Kush pushes out from its main axis  great spurs to the south, flanking the valleys which drain into the  Indus either directly or through the Kabul river.    ~The Himalaya.~--Tibet, which from the point of view of physical geography  includes a large and little known area in the Kashmir State to the north  of the Karakoram range, is a lofty, desolate, wind swept plateau with a  mean elevation of about 15,000 feet. In the part of it situated to the  north of the north-west corner of Nipal lies the Manasarowar lake, in  the neighbourhood of which three great Indian rivers, the Tsanpo or  Brahmaputra, the Sutlej, and the Indus, take their rise. The Indus flows  to the north-west for 500 miles and then turns abruptly to the south to  seek its distant home in the Indian Ocean. The Tsanpo has a still  longer course of 800 miles eastwards before it too bends southwards to  flow through Assam into the Bay of Bengal. Between the points where  these two giant rivers change their direction there extends for a  distance of 1500 miles the vast congeries of mountain ranges known  collectively as the \"Himalaya\" or \"Abode of Snow.\" As a matter of  convenience the name is sometimes confined to the mountains east of the  Indus, but geologically the hills of Buner and Swat to the north of  Peshawar probably belong to the same system. In Sanskrit literature the  Himalaya is also known as \"Himavata,\" whence the classical Emodus.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Orographical Map.]    ~The Kumaon Himalaya.~--The Himalaya may be divided longitudinally into  three sections, the eastern or Sikkim, the mid or Kumaon, and the  north-western or Ladakh. With the first we are not concerned. The Kumaon  section lies mainly in the United Provinces, but it includes the sources  of the Jamna, and contains the chain in the Panjab which is at once the  southern watershed of the Sutlej and the great divide between the two  river systems of Northern India, the Gangetic draining into the Bay of  Bengal, and the Indus carrying the enormous discharge of the north-west  Himalaya, the Muztagh-Karakoram, and the Hindu Kush ranges into the  Indian Ocean. Simla stands on the south-western end of this watershed,  and below it the Himalaya drops rapidly to the Siwalik foot-hills and to  the plains. Jakko, the _deodar_-clad hill round which so much of the  life of the summer capital of India revolves, attains a height of 8000  feet. The highest peak within a radius of 25 miles of Simla is the Chor,  which is over 12,000 feet high, and does not lose its snow cap till May.  Hattu, the well-known hill above Narkanda, which is 40 miles from Simla  by road, is 1000 feet lower. But further west in Bashahr the higher  peaks range from 16,000 to 22,000 feet.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Nanga Parvat.]    ~The Inner Himalaya or Zanskar Range.~--The division of the Himalaya into  the three sections named above is convenient for descriptive purposes.  But its chief axis runs through all the sections. East of Nipal it  strikes into Tibet not very far from the source of the Tsanpo, is soon  pierced by the gorge of the Sutlej, and beyond it forms the southern  watershed of the huge Indus valley. In the west this great rampart is  known as the Zanskar range. For a short distance it is the boundary  between the Panjab and Kashmir, separating two outlying portions of the  Kangra district, Lahul and Spiti, from Ladakh. In this section the peaks  are from 19,000 to 21,000 feet high, and the Baralacha pass on the road  from the Kulu valley in Kangra to Leh, the capital of Ladakh, is at an  elevation of about 16,500 feet. In Kashmir the Zanskar or Inner Himalaya  divides the valley of the Indus from those of the Chenab and Jhelam. It  has no mountain to dispute supremacy with Everest (29,000 feet), or  Kinchinjunga in the Eastern Himalaya, but the inferiority is only  relative. The twin peaks called Nun and Kun to the east of Srinagar  exceed 23,000 feet, and in the extreme north-west the grand mountain  mass of Nanga Parvat towers above the Indus to a height of 26,182 feet.  The lowest point in the chain is the Zojila (11,300 feet) on the route  from Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, to Leh on the Indus    The road from Srinagar to Gilgit passes over the Burzil pass at an  elevation of 13,500 feet.    The Zojila is at the top of the beautiful valley of the Sind river, a  tributary of the Jhelam. The lofty Zanskar range blocks the inward flow  of the monsoon, and once the Zojila is crossed the aspect of the country  entirely changes. The land of forest glades and green pastures is left  behind, and a region of naked and desolate grandeur begins.         \"The waste of snow ... is the frontier of barren Tibet, where sandy       wastes replace verdant meadows, and where the wild ridges, jutting       up against the sky, are kept bare of vegetation, their strata       crumbling under the destructive action of frost and water, leaving       bare ribs of gaunt and often fantastic outline.... The colouring of       the mountains is remarkable throughout Ladakh and nowhere more so       than near the Fotula (a pass on the road to Leh to the south of the       Indus gorge).... As we ascend the peaks suggest organ pipes, so       vertical are the ridges, so jagged the ascending outlines. And each       pipe is painted a different colour ... pale slate green, purple,       yellow, grey, orange, and chocolate, each colour corresponding with       a layer of the slate, shale, limestone, or trap strata\" (Neve's       _Picturesque Kashmir_, pp. 108 and 117).    [Illustration: Fig. 4. Burzil Pass.]    In all this desolation there are tiny oases where level soil and a  supply of river water permit of cultivation and of some tree growth.    ~Water divide near Baralacha and Rotang Passes in Kulu.~--We have seen  that the Indus and its greatest tributary, the Sutlej, rise beyond the  Himalaya in the Tibetan plateau. The next great water divide is in the  neighbourhood of the Baralacha pass and the Rotang pass, 30 miles to the  south of it. The route from Simla to Leh runs at a general level of 7000  to 9000 feet along or near the Sutlej-Jamna watershed to Narkanda (8800  feet). Here it leaves the Hindustan-Tibet road and drops rapidly into  the Sutlej gorge, where the Luri bridge is only 2650 feet above sea  level. Rising steeply on the other side the Jalauri pass on the  watershed between the Sutlej and the Bias is crossed at an elevation of  10,800 feet. A more gradual descent brings the traveller to the Bias at  Larji, 3080 feet above sea level. The route then follows the course of  the Bias through the beautiful Kulu valley to the Rotang pass (13,326  feet), near which the river rises. The upper part of the valley is  flanked on the west by the short, but very lofty Bara Bangahal range,  dividing Kulu from Kangra and the source of the Bias from that of the  Ravi. Beyond the Rotang is Lahul, which is divided by a watershed from  Spiti and the torrents which drain into the Sutlej. On the western side  of this watershed are the sources of the Chandra and Bhaga, which unite  to form the river known in the plains as the Chenab.    ~Mid Himalaya or Pangi Range.~--The Mid Himalayan or Pangi range, striking  west from the Rotang pass and the northern end of the Bara Bangahal  chain, passes through the heart of Chamba dividing the valley of the  Chenab (Pangi) from that of the Ravi. After entering Kashmir it crosses  the Chenab near the Kolahoi cone (17,900 feet) and the head waters of  the Jhelam. Thence it continues west over Haramukh (16,900 feet), which  casts its shadow southwards on the Wular lake, to the valley of the  Kishnganga, and probably across it to the mountains which flank the  magnificent Kagan glen in Hazara.    [Illustration: Fig. 5. Rotang Pass.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6. Mt Haramukh.]    ~Outer Himalaya or Dhauladhar-Pir Panjal Range.~--The Outer Himalaya also  starts from a point near the Rotang pass, but some way to the south of  the offset of the Mid Himalayan chain. Its main axis runs parallel to  the latter, and under the name of the Dhauladhar (white ridge) forms the  boundary of the Chamba State and Kangra, behind whose headquarters, at  Dharmsala it stands up like a huge wall. It has a mean elevation of  15,000 feet, but rises as high as 16,000. It passes from Chamba into  Bhadarwah in Kashmir, and crossing the Chenab is carried on as the Pir  Panjal range through the south of that State.

There is now a prospect that a Bee Journal will before long, be  established in this country. Such a publication has long been needed.  Properly conducted, it will have a most powerful influence in  disseminating information, awakening enthusiasm, and guarding the public  against the miserable impositions to which it has so long been  subjected.    Two such journals are now published monthly in Germany, one of which has  been in existence for more than 15 years--and their wide circulation has  made thousands well acquainted with those principles, which must  constitute the foundation of any enlightened and profitable system of  culture.    The truth is that while many of the principal facts in the physiology of  the honey bee have long been familiar to scientific observers, it has  unfortunately happened that some of the most important have been widely  discredited. In themselves they are so _wonderful_, and to those who  have not witnessed them, often _so incredible_, that it is not at all  strange that they have been rejected as fanciful conceits, or bare-faced  inventions.    Many persons have not the slightest idea that _every thing_ may be  _seen_ that takes place in a bee-hive. But hives have for many years,  been in use, containing only one large comb, enclosed on both sides, by  glass. These hives are darkened by shutters, and when opened, the queen  is exposed to observation, as well as all the other bees. Within the  last two years, I have discovered that with proper precautions, colonies  can be made to work in observing hives, without shutters, and exposed  continually to the _full light of day_; so that observations may be made  at all times, without in the least interrupting the ordinary operations  of the bees. By the aid of such hives, some of the most intelligent  citizens of Philadelphia have seen in my Apiary, the queen bee  depositing her eggs in the cells, and constantly surrounded by an  affectionate circle of her devoted children. They have also witnessed,  with astonishment and delight, all the steps in the mysterious process  of raising queens from eggs which with the ordinary development, would  have produced only the common bees. For more than three months, there  was not a day in which some of my colonies were not engaged in making  new queens to supply the place of those taken from them, and I had the  pleasure of exhibiting all the facts to bee-keepers who never before  felt willing to credit them. As _all_ my hives are so made that each  comb can be taken out, and examined at pleasure, those who use them, can  obtain from them all the information which they need, and, are no longer  forced to take any thing upon trust.    May I be permitted to express the hope that the time is now at hand,  when the number of practical observers will be so multiplied, that  ignorant and designing men will neither be able to impose their conceits  and falsehoods upon the public, nor be sustained in their attempts to  depreciate the valuable discoveries of those who have devoted years of  observation and experiment to promote the advancement of Apiarian  knowledge.          CHAPTER II.    THE HONEY BEE CAPABLE OF BEING TAMED OR DOMESTICATED TO A MOST  SURPRISING DEGREE.      If the bee had not such a necessary and yet formidable weapon both of  offence and defence, multitudes would be induced to enter upon its  cultivation, who are now afraid to have any thing to do with it. As the  new system of management which I have devised, seems to add to this  inherent difficulty, by taking the greatest possible liberties with so  irascible an insect, I deem it important to show clearly, in the very  outset, how bees may be managed, so that all necessary operations may be  performed in an Apiary, without incurring any serious risk of exciting  their anger.    Many persons have been unable to control their expressions of wonder and  astonishment, on seeing me open hive after hive, in my experimental  Apiary, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, removing the combs covered with  bees, and shaking them off in front of the hives; exhibiting the queen,  transferring the bees to another hive, and, in short, dealing with them  as if they were as harmless as so many flies. I have sometimes been  asked if the bees with which I was experimenting, had not been  subjected to a long course of instruction, to prepare them for public  exhibition; when in some cases, the very hives which I was opening,  contained swarms which had been brought only the day before, to my  establishment.    Before entering upon the natural history of the bee, I shall anticipate  some principles in its management, in order to prepare my readers to  receive, without the doubts which would otherwise be very natural, the  statements in my book, and to convince them that almost any one  favorably situated, may safely enjoy the pleasure and profit of a  pursuit, which has been most appropriately styled, \"the poetry of rural  economy;\" and that, without being made too familiar with a sharp little  weapon, which can most speedily and effectually convert all the poetry  into very sorry prose.    The Creator intended the bee for the comfort of man, as truly as he did  the horse or the cow. In the early ages of the world, indeed until very  recently, honey was almost the only natural sweet; and the promise of \"a  land flowing with milk and honey,\" had then a significance, the full  force of which it is difficult for us to realize. The honey bee was,  therefore, created not merely with the ability to store up its delicious  nectar for its own use, but with certain properties which fitted it to  be domesticated, and to labor for man, and without which, he would no  more have been able to subject it to his control, than to make a useful  beast of burden of a lion or a tiger.    One of the peculiarities which constitutes the very foundation, not  merely of my system of management, but of the ability of man to  domesticate at all so irascible an insect, has never, to my knowledge,  been clearly stated as a great and controlling principle. It may be thus  expressed.    A HONEY BEE NEVER VOLUNTEERS AN ATTACK, OR ACTS ON THE OFFENSIVE, WHEN  IT IS GORGED OR FILLED WITH HONEY.    The man who first attempted to lodge a swarm of bees in an artificial  hive, was doubtless agreeably surprised at the ease with which he was  able to accomplish it. For when the bees are intending to swarm, they  fill their honey-bags to their utmost capacity. This is wisely ordered,  that they may have materials for commencing operations immediately in  their new habitation; that they may not starve if several stormy days  should follow their emigration; and that when they leave their hives,  they may be in a suitable condition to be secured by man.    They issue from their hives in the most peaceable mood that can well be  imagined; and unless they are abused, allow themselves to be treated  with great familiarity. The hiving of bees by those who understand their  nature, could almost always be conducted without the risk of any  annoyance, if it were not the case that some improvident or unfortunate  ones occasionally come forth without the soothing supply; and not being  stored with honey, are filled with the gall of the bitterest hate  against all mankind and animal kind in general, and any one who dares to  meddle with them in particular. Such radicals are always to be dreaded,  for they must vent their spleen on something, even though they lose  their life in the act.    Suppose the whole colony, on sallying forth, to possess such a ferocious  spirit; no one would ever dare to hive them, unless clad in a coat of  mail, at least bee-proof, and not even then, until all the windows of  his house were closed, his domestic animals bestowed in some safe place,  and sentinels posted at suitable stations, to warn all comers to look  out for something almost as much to be dreaded, as a fiery locomotive  in full speed. In short, if the propensity to be exceedingly  good-natured after a hearty meal, had not been given to the bee, it  could never have been domesticated, and our honey would still be  procured from the clefts of rocks, or the hollows of trees.    A second peculiarity in the nature of the bee, and one of which I  continually avail myself with the greatest success, may be thus stated.    BEES CANNOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FILL  THEMSELVES WITH LIQUID SWEETS.    It would be quite as easy for an inveterate miser to look with  indifference upon a golden shower of double eagles, falling at his feet  and soliciting his appropriation. If then we can contrive a way to call  their attention to a treat of running sweets, when we wish to perform  any operation which might provoke them, we may be sure they will accept  it, and under its genial influence, allow us without molestation, to do  what we please.    We must always be particularly careful not to handle them roughly, for  they will never allow themselves to be pinched or hurt without thrusting  out their sting to resent such an indignity. I always keep a small  watering-pot or sprinkler, in my Apiary, and whenever I wish to operate  upon a hive, as soon as the cover is taken off, and the bees exposed, I  sprinkle them gently with water sweetened with sugar. They help  themselves with the greatest eagerness, and in a few moments, are in a  perfectly manageable state. The truth is, that bees managed on this plan  are always glad to see visitors, and you cannot look in upon them too  often, for they expect at every call, to receive a sugared treat by way  of a peace-offering.    I can superintend a large number of hives, performing every operation  that is necessary for pleasure or profit, and yet not run the risks of  being stung, which must frequently be incurred in attempting to manage,  in the simplest way, the common hives.
