Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life  I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week,  month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a  stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just  as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps  here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes.  Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say  that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used  to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up  his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with  a snort to his companions--I say it is hard never to have a bit more  liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than  usual, I have felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken  me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it  seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I  know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always  good and patient.    \"Steady, steady, my boy,\" he would say; \"wait a bit, and we will have a  good swing, and soon get the tickle out of your feet.\" Then as soon as  we were out of the village, he would give me a few miles at a spanking  trot, and then bring me back as fresh as before, only clear of the  fidgets, as he called them. Spirited horses, when not enough exercised,  are often called skittish, when it is only play; and some grooms will  punish them, but our John did not; he knew it was only high spirits.  Still, he had his own ways of making me understand by the tone of  his voice or the touch of the rein. If he was very serious and quite  determined, I always knew it by his voice, and that had more power with  me than anything else, for I was very fond of him.    I ought to say that sometimes we had our liberty for a few hours; this  used to be on fine Sundays in the summer-time. The carriage never went  out on Sundays, because the church was not far off.    It was a great treat to us to be turned out into the home paddock or  the old orchard; the grass was so cool and soft to our feet, the air so  sweet, and the freedom to do as we liked was so pleasant--to gallop, to  lie down, and roll over on our backs, or to nibble the sweet grass.  Then it was a very good time for talking, as we stood together under the  shade of the large chestnut tree.          07 Ginger      One day when Ginger and I were standing alone in the shade, we had a  great deal of talk; she wanted to know all about my bringing up and  breaking in, and I told her.    \"Well,\" said she, \"if I had had your bringing up I might have had as  good a temper as you, but now I don't believe I ever shall.\"    \"Why not?\" I said.    \"Because it has been all so different with me,\" she replied. \"I never  had any one, horse or man, that was kind to me, or that I cared to  please, for in the first place I was taken from my mother as soon as I  was weaned, and put with a lot of other young colts; none of them cared  for me, and I cared for none of them. There was no kind master like  yours to look after me, and talk to me, and bring me nice things to eat.  The man that had the care of us never gave me a kind word in my life.  I do not mean that he ill-used me, but he did not care for us one  bit further than to see that we had plenty to eat, and shelter in the  winter. A footpath ran through our field, and very often the great boys  passing through would fling stones to make us gallop. I was never hit,  but one fine young colt was badly cut in the face, and I should think  it would be a scar for life. We did not care for them, but of course  it made us more wild, and we settled it in our minds that boys were our  enemies. We had very good fun in the free meadows, galloping up and down  and chasing each other round and round the field; then standing still  under the shade of the trees. But when it came to breaking in, that was  a bad time for me; several men came to catch me, and when at last they  closed me in at one corner of the field, one caught me by the forelock,  another caught me by the nose and held it so tight I could hardly draw  my breath; then another took my under jaw in his hard hand and wrenched  my mouth open, and so by force they got on the halter and the bar into  my mouth; then one dragged me along by the halter, another flogging  behind, and this was the first experience I had of men's kindness; it  was all force. They did not give me a chance to know what they wanted.  I was high bred and had a great deal of spirit, and was very wild, no  doubt, and gave them, I dare say, plenty of trouble, but then it was  dreadful to be shut up in a stall day after day instead of having my  liberty, and I fretted and pined and wanted to get loose. You know  yourself it's bad enough when you have a kind master and plenty of  coaxing, but there was nothing of that sort for me.    \"There was one--the old master, Mr. Ryder--who, I think, could soon have  brought me round, and could have done anything with me; but he had given  up all the hard part of the trade to his son and to another experienced  man, and he only came at times to oversee. His son was a strong, tall,  bold man; they called him Samson, and he used to boast that he had never  found a horse that could throw him. There was no gentleness in him, as  there was in his father, but only hardness, a hard voice, a hard eye, a  hard hand; and I felt from the first that what he wanted was to wear all  the spirit out of me, and just make me into a quiet, humble, obedient  piece of horseflesh. 'Horseflesh'! Yes, that is all that he thought  about,\" and Ginger stamped her foot as if the very thought of him made  her angry. Then she went on:    \"If I did not do exactly what he wanted he would get put out, and make  me run round with that long rein in the training field till he had  tired me out. I think he drank a good deal, and I am quite sure that the  oftener he drank the worse it was for me. One day he had worked me hard  in every way he could, and when I lay down I was tired, and miserable,  and angry; it all seemed so hard. The next morning he came for me early,  and ran me round again for a long time. I had scarcely had an hour's  rest, when he came again for me with a saddle and bridle and a new kind  of bit. I could never quite tell how it came about; he had only just  mounted me on the training ground, when something I did put him out  of temper, and he chucked me hard with the rein. The new bit was very  painful, and I reared up suddenly, which angered him still more, and he  began to flog me. I felt my whole spirit set against him, and I began  to kick, and plunge, and rear as I had never done before, and we had a  regular fight; for a long time he stuck to the saddle and punished me  cruelly with his whip and spurs, but my blood was thoroughly up, and I  cared for nothing he could do if only I could get him off. At last after  a terrible struggle I threw him off backward. I heard him fall heavily  on the turf, and without looking behind me, I galloped off to the other  end of the field; there I turned round and saw my persecutor slowly  rising from the ground and going into the stable. I stood under an oak  tree and watched, but no one came to catch me. The time went on, and the  sun was very hot; the flies swarmed round me and settled on my bleeding  flanks where the spurs had dug in. I felt hungry, for I had not eaten  since the early morning, but there was not enough grass in that meadow  for a goose to live on. I wanted to lie down and rest, but with the  saddle strapped tightly on there was no comfort, and there was not a  drop of water to drink. The afternoon wore on, and the sun got low. I  saw the other colts led in, and I knew they were having a good feed.    \"At last, just as the sun went down, I saw the old master come out with  a sieve in his hand. He was a very fine old gentleman with quite white  hair, but his voice was what I should know him by among a thousand. It  was not high, nor yet low, but full, and clear, and kind, and when  he gave orders it was so steady and decided that every one knew, both  horses and men, that he expected to be obeyed. He came quietly along,  now and then shaking the oats about that he had in the sieve, and  speaking cheerfully and gently to me: 'Come along, lassie, come along,  lassie; come along, come along.' I stood still and let him come up; he  held the oats to me, and I began to eat without fear; his voice took all  my fear away. He stood by, patting and stroking me while I was eating,  and seeing the clots of blood on my side he seemed very vexed. 'Poor  lassie! it was a bad business, a bad business;' then he quietly took the  rein and led me to the stable; just at the door stood Samson. I laid my  ears back and snapped at him. 'Stand back,' said the master, 'and keep  out of her way; you've done a bad day's work for this filly.' He growled  out something about a vicious brute. 'Hark ye,' said the father, 'a  bad-tempered man will never make a good-tempered horse. You've not  learned your trade yet, Samson.' Then he led me into my box, took off  the saddle and bridle with his own hands, and tied me up; then he called  for a pail of warm water and a sponge, took off his coat, and while the  stable-man held the pail, he sponged my sides a good while, so tenderly  that I was sure he knew how sore and bruised they were. 'Whoa! my pretty  one,' he said, 'stand still, stand still.' His very voice did me good,  and the bathing was very comfortable. The skin was so broken at the  corners of my mouth that I could not eat the hay, the stalks hurt me. He  looked closely at it, shook his head, and told the man to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#4)"],[1,"l, monsieur?\"    \"Well, what, Planchet?\"    \"Why, you see--\" said the grocer, rubbing his hands together.    D'Artagnan crossed one leg over the other, and said, \"Planchet, my  friend, I am unnerved with extreme surprise; for you are revealing  yourself to me under a perfectly new light.\"    Planchet, flattered in the highest degree by this remark, continued to  rub his hands very hard together. \"Ah, ah,\" he said, \"because I happen  to be only slow, you think me, perhaps, a positive fool.\"    \"Very good, Planchet; very well reasoned.\"    \"Follow my idea, monsieur, if you please. I said to myself,\" continued  Planchet, \"that, without enjoyment, there is no happiness on this  earth.\"    \"Quite true, what you say, Planchet,\" interrupted D'Artagnan.    \"At all events, if we cannot obtain pleasure--for pleasure is not so  common a thing, after all--let us, at least, get consolations of some  kind or another.\"    \"And so you console yourself?\"    \"Exactly so.\"    \"Tell me how you console yourself.\"    \"I put on a buckler for the purpose of confronting _ennui_. I place my  time at the direction of patience; and on the very eve of feeling I am  going to get bored, I amuse myself.\"    \"And you don't find any difficulty in that?\"    \"None.\"    \"And you found it out quite by yourself?\"    \"Quite so.\"    \"It is miraculous.\"    \"What do you say?\"    \"I say, that your philosophy is not to be matched in the Christian or  pagan world, in modern days or in antiquity!\"    \"You think so?--follow my example, then.\"    \"It is a very tempting one.\"    \"Do as I do.\"    \"I could not wish for anything better; but all minds are not of the same  stamp; and it might possibly happen that if I were required to amuse  myself in the manner you do, I should bore myself horribly.\"    \"Bah! at least try first.\"    \"Well, tell me what you do.\"    \"Have you observed that I leave home occasionally?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"In any particular way?\"    \"Periodically.\"    \"That's the very thing. You have noticed it, then?\"    \"My dear Planchet, you must understand that when people see each other  every day, and one of the two absents himself, the other misses him. Do  you not feel the want of my society when I am in the country?\"    \"Prodigiously; that is to say, I feel like a body without a soul.\"    \"That being understood then, proceed.\"    \"What are the periods when I absent myself?\"    \"On the fifteenth and thirtieth of every month.\"    \"And I remain away?\"    \"Sometimes two, sometimes three, and sometimes four days at a time.\"    \"Have you ever given it a thought, why I was absent?\"    \"To look after your debts, I suppose.\"    \"And when I returned, how did you think I looked, as far as my face was  concerned?\"    \"Exceedingly self-satisfied.\"    \"You admit, you say, that I always look satisfied. And what have you  attributed my satisfaction to?\"    \"That your business was going on very well; that your purchases of rice,  prunes, raw sugar, dried apples, pears, and treacle were advantageous.  You were always very picturesque in your notions and ideas, Planchet;  and I was not in the slightest degree surprised to find you had selected  grocery as an occupation, which is of all trades the most varied, and  the very pleasantest, as far as the character is concerned; inasmuch as  one handles so many natural and perfumed productions.\"    \"Perfectly true, monsieur; but you are very greatly mistaken.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"In thinking that I leave here every fortnight, to collect my money or  to make purchases. Ho, ho! how could you possibly have thought such  a thing? Ho, ho, ho!\" And Planchet began to laugh in a manner that  inspired D'Artagnan with very serious misgivings as to his sanity.    \"I confess,\" said the musketeer, \"that I do not precisely catch your  meaning.\"    \"Very true, monsieur.\"    \"What do you mean by 'very true'?\"    \"It must be true, since you say it; but pray, be assured that it in no  way lessens my opinion of you.\"    \"Ah, that is lucky.\"    \"No; you are a man of genius; and whenever the question happens to be  of war, tactics, surprises, or good honest blows to be dealt with, why,  kings are marionettes, compared to you. But for the consolations of the  mind, the proper care of the body, the agreeable things of like, if one  may say so--ah! monsieur, don't talk to me about men of genius; they are  nothing short of executioners.\"    \"Good,\" said D'Artagnan, really fidgety with curiosity, \"upon my word  you interest me in the highest degree.\"    \"You feel already less bored than you did just now, do you not?\"    \"I was not bored; yet since you have been talking to me, I feel more  animated.\"    \"Very good, then; that is not a bad beginning. I will cure you, rely  upon that.\"    \"There is nothing I should like better.\"    \"Will you let me try, then?\"    \"Immediately, if you like.\"    \"Very well. Have you any horses here?\"    \"Yes; ten, twenty, thirty.\"    \"Oh, there is no occasion for so many as that, two will be quite  sufficient.\"    \"They are quite at your disposal, Planchet.\"    \"Very good; then I shall carry you off with me.\"    \"When?\"    \"To-morrow.\"    \"Where?\"    \"Ah, you are asking too much.\"    \"You will admit, however, that it is important I should know where I am  going.\"    \"Do you like the country?\"    \"Only moderately, Planchet.\"    \"In that case you like town better?\"    \"That is as may be.\"    \"Very well; I am going to take you to a place, half town and half  country.\"    \"Good.\"    \"To a place where I am sure you will amuse yourself.\"    \"Is it possible?\"    \"Yes; and more wonderful still, to a place from which you have just  returned for the purpose only, it would seem, of getting bored here.\"    \"It is to Fontainebleau you are going, then?\"    \"Exactly; to Fontainebleau.\"    \"And, in Heaven's name, what are you going to do at Fontainebleau?\"    Planchet answered D'Artagnan by a wink full of sly humor.    \"You have some property there, you rascal.\"    \"Oh, a very paltry affair; a little bit of a house--nothing more.\"    \"I understand you.\"    \"But it is tolerable enough, after all.\"    \"I am going to Planchet's country-seat!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan.    \"Whenever you like.\"    \"Did we not fix to-morrow?\"    \"Let us say to-morrow, if you like; and then, besides, to-morrow is the  14th, that is to say, the day before the one when I am afraid of getting  bored; so we will look upon it as an understood thing.\"    \"Agreed, by all means.\"    \"You will lend me one of your horses?\"    \"The best I have.\"    \"No; I prefer the gentlest of all; I never was a very good rider, as  you know, and in my grocery business I have got more awkward than ever;  besides--\"    \"Besides what?\"    \"Why,\" added Planchet, \"I do not wish to fatigue myself.\"    \"Why so?\" D'Artagnan ventured to ask.    \"Because I should lose half the pleasure I expect to enjoy,\" replied  Planchet. And thereupon he rose from his sack of Indian corn, stretching  himself, and making all his bones crack, one after the other, with a  sort of harmony.    \"Planchet! Planchet!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, \"I do declare that there is  no sybarite upon the face of the globe who can for a moment be compared  to you. Oh, Planchet, it is very clear that we have never yet eaten a  ton of salt together.\"    \"Why so, monsieur?\"    \"Because, even now I can scarcely say I know you,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and  because, in point of fact, I return to the opinion which, for a moment,  I had formed of you that day at Boulogne, when you strangled, or did so  as nearly as possible, M. de Wardes's valet, Lubin; in plain language,  Planchet, that you are a man of great resources.\"    Planchet began to laugh with a laugh full of self-conceit; bade the  musketeer good-night, and went down to his back shop, which he used as  a bedroom. D'Artagnan resumed his original position upon his chair, and  his brow, which had been unruffled for a moment, became more pensive  than ever. He had already forgotten the whims and dreams of Planchet.  \"Yes,\" said he, taking up again the thread of his thoughts, which  had been broken by the whimsical conversation in which we have just  permitted our readers to participate. \"Yes, yes, those three points  include everything: First, to ascertain what Baisemeaux wanted with  Aramis; secondly, to learn why Aramis does not let me hear from him; and  thirdly, to ascertain where Porthos is. The whole mystery lies in these  three points. Since, therefore,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"our friends tell  us nothing, we must have recourse to our own poor intelligence. I must  do what I can, _mordioux_, or rather _Malaga_, as Planchet would say.\"        Chapter II. A Letter from M. Baisemeaux.    D'Artagnan, faithful to his plan, went the very next morning to pay  a visit to M. de Baisemeaux. It was cleaning up or tidying day at the  Bastile; the cannons were furbished up, the staircases scraped and  cleaned; and the jailers seemed to be carefully engaged in polishing  the very keys. As for the soldiers belonging to the garrison, they were  walking about in different courtyards, under the pretense that they were  clean enough. The governor, Baisemeaux, received D'Artagnan with more  than ordinary politeness, but he behaved towards him with so marked a  reserve of manner, that all D'Artagnan's tact and cleverness could not  get a syllable out of him. The more he kept himself within bounds,  the more D'Artagnan's suspicion increased. The latter even fancied he  remarked that the governor was acting under the influence of a recent  recommendation. Baisemeaux had not been at the Palais Royal with  D'Artagnan the same cold and impenetrable man which the latter now found  in the Baisemeaux of the Bastile. When D'Artagnan wished to make him  talk about the urgent money matters which had brought Baisemeaux in  search of D'Artagnan, and had rendered him expansive, notwithstanding  what had passed on that evening, Baisemeaux pretended that he had some  orders to give in the prison, and left D'Artagnan so "]]]
