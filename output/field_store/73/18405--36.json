Moreover, as  a rule, it will be found that remote success is an end which appeals  most to those in whom egoistic desire to get ahead--to get ahead of  others--is already only too strong a motive. Those in whom personal  ambition is already so strong that it paints glowing pictures of future  victories may be touched; others of a more generous nature do not  respond.    I cannot stop to paint the other side. I can only say that the  introduction of every method that appeals to the child's active powers,  to his capacities in construction, production, and creation, marks an  opportunity to shift the centre of ethical gravity from an absorption  which is selfish to a service which is social. Manual training is more  than manual; it is more than intellectual; in the hands of any good  teacher it lends itself easily, and almost as a matter of course, to  development of social habits. Ever since the philosophy of Kant, it has  been a commonplace of aesthetic theory, that art is universal; that it is  not the product of purely personal desire or appetite, or capable of  merely individual appropriation, but has a value participated in by all  who perceive it. Even in the schools where most conscious attention is  paid to moral considerations, the methods of study and recitation may be  such as to emphasize appreciation rather than power, an emotional  readiness to assimilate the experiences of others, rather than  enlightened and trained capacity to carry forward those values which in  other conditions and past times made those experiences worth having. At  all events, separation between instruction and character continues in  our schools (in spite of the efforts of individual teachers) as a result  of divorce between learning and doing. The attempt to attach genuine  moral effectiveness to the mere processes of learning, and to the habits  which go along with learning, can result only in a training infected  with formality, arbitrariness, and an undue emphasis upon failure to  conform. That there is as much accomplished as there is shows the  possibilities involved in methods of school activity which afford  opportunity for reciprocity, cooperation, and positive personal  achievement.          THE SOCIAL NATURE OF THE COURSE OF STUDY          IV    THE SOCIAL NATURE OF THE COURSE OF STUDY      In many respects, it is the subject-matter used in school life which  decides both the general atmosphere of the school and the methods of  instruction and discipline which rule. A barren \"course of study,\" that  is to say, a meagre and narrow field of school activities, cannot  possibly lend itself to the development of a vital social spirit or to  methods that appeal to sympathy and cooperation instead of to  absorption, exclusiveness, and competition. Hence it becomes an all  important matter to know how we shall apply our social standard of moral  value to the subject-matter of school work, to what we call,  traditionally, the \"studies\" that occupy pupils.    _A study is to be considered as a means of bringing the child to realize  the social scene of action._ Thus considered it gives a criterion for  selection of material and for judgment of values. We have at present  three independent values set up: one of culture, another of information,  and another of discipline. In reality, these refer only to three phases  of social interpretation. Information is genuine or educative only in so  far as it presents definite images and conceptions of materials placed  in a context of social life. Discipline is genuinely educative only as  it represents a reaction of information into the individual's own powers  so that he brings them under control for social ends. Culture, if it is  to be genuinely educative and not an external polish or factitious  varnish, represents the vital union of information and discipline. It  marks the socialization of the individual in his outlook upon life.    This point may be illustrated by brief reference to a few of the school  studies. In the first place, there is no line of demarkation within  facts themselves which classifies them as belonging to science, history,  or geography, respectively. The pigeon-hole classification which is so  prevalent at present (fostered by introducing the pupil at the outset  into a number of different studies contained in different text-books)  gives an utterly erroneous idea of the relations of studies to one  another and to the intellectual whole to which all belong. In fact,  these subjects have to do with the same ultimate reality, namely, the  conscious experience of man. It is only because we have different  interests, or different ends, that we sort out the material and label  part of it science, part of it history, part geography, and so on. Each  \"sorting\" represents materials arranged with reference to some one  dominant typical aim or process of the social life.    This social criterion is necessary, not only to mark off studies from  one another, but also to grasp the reasons for each study,--the motives  in connection with which it shall be presented. How, for example, should  we define geography? What is the unity in the different so-called  divisions of geography,--mathematical geography, physical geography,  political geography, commercial geography? Are they purely empirical  classifications dependent upon the brute fact that we run across a lot  of different facts? Or is there some intrinsic principle through which  the material is distributed under these various heads,--something in the  interest and attitude of the human mind towards them? I should say that  geography has to do with all those aspects of social life which are  concerned with the interaction of the life of man and nature; or, that  it has to do with the world considered as the scene of social  interaction. Any fact, then, will be geographical in so far as it has to  do with the dependence of man upon his natural environment, or with  changes introduced in this environment through the life of man.    The four forms of geography referred to above represent, then, four  increasing stages of abstraction in discussing the mutual relation of  human life and nature. The beginning must be social geography, the frank  recognition of the earth as the home of men acting in relations to one  another. I mean by this that the essence of any geographical fact is the  consciousness of two persons, or two groups of persons, who are at once  separated and connected by their physical environment, and that the  interest is in seeing how these people are at once kept apart and  brought together in their actions by the instrumentality of the physical  environment. The ultimate significance of lake, river, mountain, and  plain is not physical but social; it is the part which it plays in  modifying and directing human relationships. This evidently involves an  extension of the term commercial. It has to do not simply with business,  in the narrow sense, but with whatever relates to human intercourse and  intercommunication as affected by natural forms and properties.  Political geography represents this same social interaction taken in a  static instead of in a dynamic way; taken, that is, as temporarily  crystallized and fixed in certain forms. Physical geography (including  under this not simply physiography, but also the study of flora and  fauna) represents a further analysis or abstraction. It studies the  conditions which determine human action, leaving out of account,  temporarily, the ways in which they concretely do this. Mathematical  geography carries the analysis back to more ultimate and remote  conditions, showing that the physical conditions of the earth are not  ultimate, but depend upon the place which the world occupies in a larger  system. Here, in other words, are traced, step by step, the links which  connect the immediate social occupations and groupings of men with the  whole natural system which ultimately conditions them. Step by step the  scene is enlarged and the image of what enters into the make-up of  social action is widened and broadened; at no time is the chain of  connection to be broken.    It is out of the question to take up the studies one by one and show  that their meaning is similarly controlled by social considerations. But  I cannot forbear saying a word or two upon history. History is vital or  dead to the child according as it is, or is not, presented from the  sociological standpoint. When treated simply as a record of what has  passed and gone, it must be mechanical, because the past, as the past,  is remote. Simply as the past there is no motive for attending to it.  The ethical value of history teaching will be measured by the extent to  which past events are made the means of understanding the  present,--affording insight into what makes up the structure and working  of society to-day. Existing social structure is exceedingly complex. It  is practically impossible for the child to attack it _en masse_ and get  any definite mental image of it. But type phases of historical  development may be selected which will exhibit, as through a telescope,  the essential constituents of the existing order. Greece, for example,  represents what art and growing power of individual expression stand  for; Rome exhibits the elements and forces of political life on a  tremendous scale. Or, as these civilizations are themselves relatively  complex, a study of still simpler forms of hunting, nomadic, and  agricultural life in the beginnings of civilization, a study of the  effects of the introduction of iron, and iron tools, reduces the  complexity to simpler elements.    One reason historical teaching is usually not more effective is that the  student is set to acquire information in such a way that no epochs or  factors stand out in his mind as typical; everything is reduced to the  same dead level. The way to secure the necessary perspective is to treat  the past as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#4)"],[1,"of things other than repressive, are mainly of  children.  The little ones teach each other.  Brothers and sisters are  more with each other than are ordinary playmates, and in the familiarity  of their constant intercourse some of the great lessons, so useful in  after-life, are learned.  Little Stephen had no means of learning the  wisdom of give-and-take.  To her everything was given, given bountifully  and gracefully.  Graceful acceptance of good things came to her  naturally, as it does to one who is born to be a great lady.  The  children of the farmers in the neighbourhood, with whom at times she  played, were in such habitual awe of the great house, that they were  seldom sufficiently at ease to play naturally.  Children cannot be on  equal terms on special occasions with a person to whom they have been  taught to bow or courtesy as a public habit.  The children of  neighbouring landowners, who were few and far between, and of the  professional people in Norcester, were at such times as Stephen met them,  generally so much on their good behaviour, that the spontaneity of play,  through which it is that sharp corners of individuality are knocked off  or worn down, did not exist.    And so Stephen learned to read in the Book of Life; though only on one  side of it.  At the age of six she had, though surrounded with loving  care and instructed by skilled teachers, learned only the accepting side  of life.  Giving of course there was in plenty, for the traditions of  Normanstand were royally benevolent; many a blessing followed the little  maid's footsteps as she accompanied some timely aid to the sick and needy  sent from the Squire's house.  Moreover, her Aunt tried to inculcate  certain maxims founded on that noble one that it is more blessed to give  than to receive.  But of giving in its true sense: the giving that which  we want for ourselves, the giving that is as a temple built on the rock  of self-sacrifice, she knew nothing.  Her sweet and spontaneous nature,  which gave its love and sympathy so readily, was almost a bar to  education: it blinded the eyes that would have otherwise seen any defect  that wanted altering, any evil trait that needed repression, any lagging  virtue that required encouragement--or the spur.          CHAPTER III--HAROLD      Squire Norman had a clerical friend whose rectory of Carstone lay some  thirty miles from Normanstand.  Thirty miles is not a great distance for  railway travel; but it is a long drive.  The days had not come, nor were  they ever likely to come, for the making of a railway between the two  places.  For a good many years the two men had met in renewal of their  old University days.  Squire Norman and Dr. An Wolf had been chums at  Trinity, Cambridge, and the boyish friendship had ripened and lasted.  When Harold An Wolf had put in his novitiate in a teeming Midland  manufacturing town, it was Norman's influence which obtained the  rectorship for his friend.  It was not often that they could meet, for An  Wolf's work, which, though not very exacting, had to be done  single-handed, kept him to his post.  Besides, he was a good scholar and  eked out a small income by preparing a few pupils for public school.  An  occasional mid-week visit to Normanstand in the slack time of school work  on the Doctor's part, and now and again a drive by Norman over to the  rectory, returning the next day, had been for a good many years the  measure of their meeting.  Then An Wolf's marriage and the birth of a son  had kept him closer to home.  Mrs. An Wolf had been killed in a railway  accident a couple of years after her only child had been born; and at the  time Norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power to the  afflicted man, and to give him what was under the circumstances his best  gift, sympathy.  After an interval of a few years the Squire's courtship  and marriage, at which his old friend had assisted, had confined his  activities to a narrower circle.  The last time they had met was when An  Wolf had come over to Norcester to aid in the burial of his friend's  wife.  In the process of years, however, the shadow over Norman's life  had begun to soften; when his baby had grown to be something of a  companion, they met again.  Norman, 'who had never since his wife's death  been able to tear himself, even for a night, away from Normanstand and  Stephen, wrote to his old friend asking him to come to him.  An Wolf  gladly promised, and for a week of growing expectation the Squire looked  forward to their meeting.  Each found the other somewhat changed, in all  but their old affection.    An Wolf was delighted with the little Stephen.  Her dainty beauty seemed  to charm him; and the child, seeming to realise what pleasure she was  giving, exercised all her little winning ways.  The rector, who knew more  of children than did his, friend, told her as she sat on his knee of a  very interesting person: his own son.  The child listened, interested at  first, then enraptured.  She asked all kinds of questions; and the  father's eyes brightened as he gladly answered the pretty sympathetic  child, already deep in his heart for her father's sake.  He told her  about the boy who was so big and strong, and who could run and leap and  swim and play cricket and football better than any other boy with whom he  played.  When, warmed himself by the keen interest of the little girl,  and seeing her beautiful black eyes beginning to glow, he too woke to the  glory of the time; and all the treasured moments of the father's lonely  heart gave out their store.  And the other father, thrilled with delight  because of his baby's joy with, underlying all, an added pleasure that  the little Stephen's interest was in sports that were for boys, looked on  approvingly, now and again asking questions himself in furtherance of the  child's wishes.    All the afternoon they sat in the garden, close to the stream that came  out of the rock, and An Wolf told father's tales of his only son.  Of the  great cricket match with Castra Puerorum when he had made a hundred not  out.  Of the school races when he had won so many prizes.  Of the  swimming match in the Islam River when, after he had won the race and had  dressed himself, he went into the water in his clothes to help some  children who had upset a boat.  How when Widow Norton's only son could  not be found, he dived into the deep hole of the intake of the milldam of  the great Carstone mills where Wingate the farrier had been drowned.  And  how, after diving twice without success, he had insisted on going down  the third time though people had tried to hold him back; and how he had  brought up in his arms the child all white and so near death that they  had to put him in the ashes of the baker's oven before he could be  brought back to life.    When her nurse came to take her to bed, she slid down from her father's  knee and coming over to Dr. An Wolf, gravely held out her hand and said:  'Good-bye!'  Then she kissed him and said:    'Thank you so much, Mr. Harold's daddy.  Won't you come soon again, and  tell us more?'  Then she jumped again upon her father's knee and hugged  him round the neck and kissed him, and whispered in his ear:    'Daddy, please make Mr. Harold's daddy when he comes again, bring Harold  with him!'    After all it is natural for women to put the essence of the letter in the  postscript!    Two weeks afterwards Dr. An Wolf came again and brought Harold with him.  The time had gone heavily with little Stephen when she knew that Harold  was coming with his father.  Stephen had been all afire to see the big  boy whose feats had so much interested her, and for a whole week had  flooded Mrs. Jarrold with questions which she was unable to answer.  At  last the time came and she went out to the hall door with her father to  welcome the guests.  At the top of the great granite steps, down which in  time of bad weather the white awning ran, she stood holding her father's  hand and waving a welcome.    'Good morning, Harold!  Good morning, Mr. Harold's daddy!'    The meeting was a great pleasure to both the children, and resulted in an  immediate friendship.  The small girl at once conceived a great  admiration for the big, strong boy nearly twice her age and more than  twice her size.  At her time of life the convenances are not, and love is  a thing to be spoken out at once and in the open.  Mrs. Jarrold, from the  moment she set eyes on him, liked the big kindly-faced boy who treated  her like a lady, and who stood awkwardly blushing and silent in the  middle of the nursery listening to the tiny child's proffers of  affection.  For whatever kind of love it is that boys are capable of,  Harold had fallen into it.  'Calf-love' is a thing habitually treated  with contempt.  It may be ridiculous; but all the same it is a serious  reality--to the calf.    Harold's new-found affection was as deep as his nature.  An only child  who had in his memory nothing of a mother's love, his naturally  affectionate nature had in his childish days found no means of  expression.  A man child can hardly pour out his full heart to a man,  even a father or a comrade; and this child had not, in a way, the  consolations of other children.  His father's secondary occupation of  teaching brought other boys to the house and necessitated a domestic  routine which had to be exact.  There was no place for little girls in a  boys' school; and though many of Dr. An Wolf's friends who were mothers  made much of the pretty, quiet boy, and took him to play with their  children, he never seemed to get really intimate with them.  The equality  of companionship was wanting.  Boys he knew, and with them he could hold  his own and yet be on affectionate terms.  But girls were strange to him,  and in their presence he was shy.  With this lack of understanding of the  other sex, grew up a sort of awe of it.  His opportunities of this kind  of"]]]
