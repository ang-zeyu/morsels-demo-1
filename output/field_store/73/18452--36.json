But they liked _me_  best, of course. They were a noble family; and I should have been living  with them still, but one year, when they went to the seaside, they  forgot to provide for my board and lodging, and I had to go into trade  again.    \"'Milk ahoy! milk ahoy!' I heard that well-known music as I sat lonely  on the doorstep of the deserted mansion in the Square. The milkman  looked lonely too; so I thought it would be only kind to go home with  him. I did. He was a very well-meaning man, but his tastes were low. He  took skim milk in his tea, and gave me the same. Of course, after that,  I could not stay another hour under his roof.    \"I tried two or three other houses, and I could have been happy with a  very nice butcher who kept a corner shop, but he kept a dog also, a dog  that no cat in her senses would live in the same street with; so I came  away--rather hurriedly, I remember--and the dog saw me off. Now I live  with a worker in silver, and I have cream every day; and when he makes a  cream-jug, and I remember what will be put in it some day, I lick my  lips, and think what a happy cat I am to live with such a good man.  Where do you live?\"    \"With a poor widow, in an attic. I never have enough to eat.\" And,  indeed, the grey cat was thin.    \"Why do you stay with her?\"    \"Because I love her,\" said the grey cat.    \"Love!\" replied the tortoiseshell cat.    \"Nonsense! I never heard of such a thing.\"    \"Poor puss!\" said the parrot in the window. The grey cat thought it was  speaking to the tortoiseshell, and the tortoiseshell was certain it  meant the grey. Which do _you_ think it meant?          Meddlesome Pussy      I WAS separated from my mother at a very early age, and sent out into  the world alone, long before I had had time to learn to say \"please\" and  \"thank you,\" and to shut the door after me, and little things like that.  One of the things I had not learned to understand was the difference  between milk in a saucer on the floor, and milk in a jug on the table.  Other cats tell me there is a difference, but I can't see it. The  difference is not in the taste of the milk--that is precisely the same.    It is not so easy to get the milk out of a jug, and I should have  thought some credit would attach to a cat who performed so clever a  feat. The world, my dear, thinks otherwise. This difference of opinion  has, through life, been a fruitful source of sorrow to me. I cannot tell  you how much I have suffered for it. The first occasion I remember was a  beautiful day in June, when the sun shone, and all the world looked  fair. I was destined to remember that day.    The fishmonger (talk of statues to heroes! I would raise one to that  noble man!)--the fishmonger, I say, brought his usual little present to  _me_. I let the cook take it and prepare it for my eating. I am always  generous enough to permit the family to be served first--and then I have  my dinner quietly at the back door.    Well, he had brought the salmon, and I followed the cook in, to see  that it wasn't put where those dogs could get it; and then, the  dining-room door being opened, I walked in. The breakfast things were  lying littered about, and on the tea-tray was a jug.    Of course, I walked across the table, and looked into the jug; there was  milk in it.    It was a sensible, wide-mouthed jug, and I should have been quite able  to make a comfortable breakfast, if some clumsy, careless servant hadn't  rushed into the room, crying \"Shoo! scat!\"    This startled me, of course. I am very sensitive. I started, the jug  went over, and the milk ran on to the cloth, and down on the new carpet.  You will hardly believe it, but that servant, to conceal her own  carelessness, beat me with a feather brush, and threw me out of the back  door; and cook, who was always a heartless person, though stout, gave  me no dinner. Ah! if my fishmonger had only known that I never tasted  his beautiful present, after all!    But though I admired him so much, I could not talk to him. I never, from  a kitten, could speak any foreign language fluently. So he never knew.    My next misadventure was on an afternoon when the family expected  company, and the best china was set out. Why \"best\"? Why should a  saucer, all blue and gold and red, with a crown on the back, be better  than a white one with mauve blobs on it? I never could see. Milk tastes  equally well from both.    I went into the drawing-room before the guests arrived--just to be sure  that everything was as I could wish--and, seeing the tea set out, I got  on the table, as usual, to see whether there was anything in the  saucers. There was not, but in the best milk-jug there was--CREAM!    The neck of the best milk-jug was narrow. I could not get my head in, so  I turned it over with my paw. It fell with a crash, and I paused a  moment--these little shocks always upset me. All was still--I began to  lap. Oh! that cream! I shall never forget it!    Then came a rush, and the fatal cry of \"Shoo! scat!\"--always presaging  disaster. I saw the door open, and, by an instinct I cannot explain, I  leaped from the table. In my hurry, my foot caught in the handle of the  silver tray. We fell together--neither the tray nor I was hurt--but the  best china!!!    I picked myself up, and looked about me. The family had come in. I read  in their faces that their servant's unlucky interruption-of my meal had  destroyed what was dearer to them than life--than _my_ life, at any  rate. I fled. I went out homeless and hopeless into the golden  afternoon.    I live now with a Saint--a maiden lady, who takes condensed milk in her  own tea, and buys me two-pennyworth of cream night and morning.    And cat's meat, too!    And the glorious fishmonger still leaves his offerings at my door.          Nine Lives      \"MOTHER,\" said the yellow kitten, \"is it true that we cats have nine  lives?\"    \"Quite, my dear,\" the brindled cat replied. She was a very handsome cat,  and in very comfortable circumstances. She sat on a warm Turkey carpet,  and wore a blue satin ribbon round her neck. \"I am in the ninth life  myself,\" she said.    \"Have you lived all your lives here?\"    \"Oh dear, no!\"    \"Were you here,\" the white kitten asked, in a sleepy voice, \"when the  Turkey carpet was born? Rover says it is only a few months old.\"    \"No,\" said the mother, \"I was not. Indeed, it was partly the softness of  that carpet that made me come and live here.\"    \"Where did you live before?\" the black kitten said.    A dreamy look came into the brindled cat's eyes.    \"In many strange places,\" she answered slowly; adding more briskly, \"and  if you will be good kittens, I will tell you all about them. Goldie!  come down from that stool, and sit down like a good kitten. Sweep! leave  off sharpening your claws on the furniture; _that_ always ends in  trouble and punishment. Snowball! you're asleep again! Oh, well; if  you'd rather sleep than hear a story----\"    Snowball shook herself awake, and the others sat down close to their  mother with their tails arranged neatly beside them, and waited for the  story.    \"I was born,\" said the brindled cat, \"in a barn.\"    \"What is a barn?\" asked the black kitten.    \"A barn is like a house, but there is only one room, and no carpets,  only straw.\"    \"I should like that,\" said the yellow kitten, who often played among the  straw in the big box which brought groceries from the Stores.    \"I liked it well enough when I was your age,\" said the mother  indulgently, \"but a barn is not at all a genteel place to be born in. My  mother had had a little unpleasantness with the family she lived with,  and, of course, she was too proud to stay on after that. And so she  left them, and went to live in the barn. It wasn't at all the sort of  life she had been accustomed to.\"    \"What was the unpleasantness?\" Sweep asked.    \"Well, it was about some cream which the woman of the house wanted for  her tea. She should have said so. Of course, my mother would not have  taken it if she had had any idea that any one else wanted it. She was  always most unselfish.\"    \"What is tea?\"    \"A kind of brown milk--very nasty indeed, and very bad for you. Well, I  lived with my brothers and sisters very happily for some months, for I  was too young to know how vulgar it was to live in a barn and play with  straw.\"    \"What is vulgar, mother?\"    \"Dear, dear; how you do ask questions,\" said the brindled cat, beginning  to look worried. \"Vulgar is being like everybody else.\"    \"But does everybody else live in a barn?\"    \"No; nobody does who is respectable. Vulgar really means--not like  respectable cats.\"    \"Oh!\" said the black kitten and the yellow, trying to look as if they  understood. But the white one did not say anything, because it had gone  to sleep again.    \"Well,\" the mother went on, \"after a while they took me to live in the  farm-house. And I should have liked it well enough, only they had a low  habit of locking up the dairy and the pantry. Well, it would be tiresome  to go into the whole story; however, I soon finished my life at the  farm-house and went to live in the stable. It was very pleasant there.  Horses are excellent company. That was my third life. My fourth was at  the miller's. He came one day to buy some corn; he saw me, and admired  me--as, indeed, every one has always done. He and the farmer were  disputing about the price of the corn, and at last the miller said--    \"'Look here; you shall have your price if you'll throw me that cat into  the bargain.'\"    The kittens all shuddered. \"What is a bargain? Is it like a pond? And  were you thrown in?\"    \"I was thrown in, I believe. But a bargain is not like a pond; though I  heard the two men talk of 'wetting' the bargain. But I suppose they did  not do it, for I arrived "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27238"],[0,"Woodworking Tools 1600-1900 (#4)"],[1,"cabinetmaker's dividers illustrated in figures 15 and  16 suggest significant changes in the design of a basic tool. The  dividers shown in figure 15 are English and would seem to be of early  18th-century origin, perhaps even earlier. They are Renaissance in  feeling with decorated legs and a heart-shaped stop on the end of the  slide-arm. In character, they are like the great dividers shown in  figure 13: functional, but at the same time preserving in their  decoration the features common to a wide variety of ironwork and wares  beyond the realm of tools alone. The dividers pictured in figure 16 are  a decided contrast. Dated 1783, they are strongly suggestive of  Sheffield origin. Gone is the superfluous decoration; in its place is  the strong, crisp line of a tool that has reached nearly the ultimate of  function and manufacture, a device which both in general appearance and  precise design is very modern in execution. Equally intriguing are the  smaller, more slender dividers (accession 319557) of the 18th-century  house-builder as seen in figure 18, a form that changed very little, if  at all, until after 1850--a fact confirmed by the frontispiece of Edward  Shaw's _The Modern Architect_, published in Boston in 1855 (fig. 19).  The double calipers of the woodturner (fig. 20) have by far the most  appealing and ingenious design of all such devices. Designed for  convenience, few tools illustrate better the aesthetic of the purely  functional than this pair of 19th-century American calipers.    [Illustration: Figure 20.--EARLY 19TH CENTURY: THE DOUBLE CALIPERS of  the woodturner permitted double readings to be taken without changing  the set of the tool. Inherent in this practical design is a gracefulness  of line seldom surpassed. (Private collection. Smithsonian photo  49793-C.)]    [Illustration: Figure 21.--1704: THE FLOOR PLANE OR LONG JOINER of  Norwegian origin exhibits the characteristic decoration of the stock and  mouth, patterns common on tools of northern European and Scandinavian  origin. (_Courtesy of the Norsk Folkemuseum, Oslo, Norway._)]    Intended to establish proportion and to insure precision, it seems a  natural consequence that dividers and calipers should in themselves  reflect the same sense of balance and grace that they were designed to  govern. Still, even the most prosaic examples of woodworking tools,  completely divorced from the quasi-mathematical devices of measure and  proportion, have this quality and can be admired solely as decorative  objects. This is most evident in the three European bench planes  illustrated in figures 21, 22, and 23: one Norwegian, dated 1704; one  Dutch (accession 319562), dated 1756; and one German, dated 1809. The  Norwegian and German examples, with their elaborately carved bodies and  heart-shaped mouths, are typical of the type that Swedish and German  colonists in America might have used in the 17th and 18th centuries.  They are important for that reason. Also, all three exhibit elaboration  found on other material survivals from these countries in their  respective periods. For example, the incised rosette of the Dutch plane  (fig. 22) is especially suggestive of the rosettes found on English and  American furniture of the 1750's and 1760's, specifically on high  chests.    The decorative motifs that characterized European tools of the 17th and  18th centuries obscured technical improvement. By contrast, in England  and America, tools gained distinction through the directness of their  design. Following English patterns, tools of American make were  straightforward. Only later, in new tool types, did they imitate the  rococo flourish of their European predecessors. In America, as in  England, the baroque for things functional seemingly had little appeal.  This is particularly true of woodworking planes on which, unlike their  continental cousins, embellishment is rarely seen. Exemplifying this  tradition are three early 19th-century American planes: a plow, for  cutting channels of various widths on board edges, marked \"G. White,  Philda\" (fig. 24); a rabbet, for notching the margin of boards; made  by E.W. Carpenter of Lancaster, Pennsylvania (fig. 25); and a jack or  foreplane, for rough surfacing (accession 61.547), made by A. Klock and  dated 1818 as seen in figure 26.    [Illustration: Figure 22.--1756: THE HIGHLY elaborated stock and  rosette-incised wedge of the smoothing plane recall the decoration on  furniture of the period. The plane is of Dutch origin. (Smithsonian  photo 49792-F.)]    [Illustration: Figure 23.--1809: THIS BENCH PLANE of German origin is  dated 1809. It is of a traditional form that persists to the present  day. The planes pictured in figures 21, 22, and 23 are similar to the  type brought to North America by non-English colonists. (Private  collection. Smithsonian photo 49793-F.)]    [Illustration: Figure 24.--ABOUT 1818: This plow plane, used to cut  narrow channels on the edges of boards, was made by G. White of  Philadelphia in the early 19th century. It is essentially the same tool  depicted in the catalogues of Sheffield manufactures and in the plates  from Martin and Nicholson. The pattern of the basic bench tools used in  America consistently followed British design, at least until the last  quarter of the 19th century. (Private collection. Smithsonian photo  49794-E.)]    [Illustration: Figure 25. 1830-1840: THE DESIGN OF the rabbet plane,  used to cut a groove of fixed width and depth on the edge of a board,  was not improved upon in the 19th century. The carpenter's dependence on  this tool lessened only after the perfection of multipurpose metallic  planes that could be readily converted to cut a \"rabbet.\" (Private  collection. Smithsonian photo 494789-H).]    The question of dating arises, since only the Klock piece is firmly  fixed. How, for example, is the early 19th-century attribution arrived  at for the planes inscribed White and Carpenter? First, the nature of  the stamped name \"G. White\" is of proper character for the period.  Second, G. White is listed in the Philadelphia city directories as a  \"plane-maker\" between the years 1818 and 1820, working at the back of 5  Filbert Street and later at 34 Juliana Street. Third, internal evidence  on the plane itself gives a clue. In this case, the hardware--rivets and  furrels--is similar if not identical to that found on firearms of the  period, weapons whose dates of manufacture are known. The decorative  molding on the fence of this plane is proper for the period; this is not  a reliable guide, however, since similar moldings are retained  throughout the century. Finally, the plane is equipped with a fence  controlled by slide-arms, fixed with wedges and not by adjustable screw  arms. After 1830, tools of high quality, such as White's, invariably  have the screw arms. The rabbet plane, made by Carpenter, is traceable  via another route, the U.S. Patent Office records. Carpenter,  self-designated \"toolmaker of Lancaster,\" submitted patents for the  improvement of wood planes between 1831 and 1849. Examples of  Carpenter's work, always stamped as shown in figure 27, survive, both  dated and undated. There are several of his planes in the collections of  the Bucks County Historical Society, and dated pieces are known in  private collections.    Inherent in the bench planes is a feeling of motion, particularly in the  plow and the rabbet where basic design alone conveys the idea that they  were meant to move over fixed surfaces. Of the three examples, only the  brass tippings and setscrew of the plow plane suggest any enrichment,  and of course these were not intended for decoration; in later years,  however, boxwood, fruitwood, and even ivory tips were added to the more  expensive factory models. Also unintentional, but pleasing, is the  distinctive throat of the rabbet plane--a design that developed to  permit easy discharge of shavings, and one that mass manufacture did  not destroy.    [Illustration: Figure 26.--1818: THE JACK PLANE, used first by the  carpenter for rapid surfacing, is distinguished primarily by the bezeled  and slightly convex edge of its cutting iron. As with the plow and the  rabbet, its shape is ubiquitous. Dated and marked A. Klock, this  American example follows precisely those detailed in Sheffield pattern  books. (Smithsonian photo 49794-C.)]    [Illustration: Figure 27.--1830-1840: DETAIL OF the rabbet plane (fig.  25) showing the characteristic stamp of E.W. Carpenter. (Smithsonian  photo 49794-D.)]    [Illustration: Figure 28.--ABOUT 1631: THE PRECEDING ILLUSTRATIONS  emphasize the divergent appearance of European and Anglo-American tools.  This, however, was not always the case. The woodworker's shop by the  Dutch engraver Jan Van Vliet suggests the similarity between English and  European tool types in the 17th century. Note in particular the planes,  axe, brace, and auger as compared to Moxon. (Library of Congress,  Division of Prints and Photographs.)]    [Illustration: Figure 29.--1690: THE CABINETMAKER'S SHOP from Elias  Pozelius, _Orbus Pictus nach Zeichnugen der Susanna Maria_ _Sandrart_,  Nuernberg, 1690.

(Library of Congress.)]    The divergence from European to an Anglo-American hand-tool design and  the approximate date that it occurred can be suggested by a comparison  of contemporary illustrations. The change in the wooden bench plane can  be followed from the early 17th century through its standardization at  the end of the 18th century. Examine first the planes as drawn in the  1630's by the Dutchman Jan Van Vliet (fig. 28), an etcher of Rembrandt's  school at Leiden, and also the examples illustrated by Porzelius (fig.  29) and by Jost Amman (fig. 30).
