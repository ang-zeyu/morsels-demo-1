CHAPTER II      Urbain Granadier was not satisfied with the arrogant demonstration by  which he signalised his return, which even his friends had felt to be  ill advised; instead of allowing the hate he had aroused to die away or  at least to fall asleep by letting the past be past, he continued with  more zeal than ever his proceedings against Duthibaut, and succeeded in  obtaining a decree from the Parliament of La Tournelle, by which  Duthibaut was summoned before it, and obliged to listen bareheaded to a  reprimand, to offer apologies, and to pay damages and costs.    Having thus got the better of one enemy, Urbain turned on the others,  and showed himself more indefatigable in the pursuit of justice than  they had been in the pursuit of vengeance. The decision of the  archbishop had given him a right to a sum of money for compensation, and  interest thereon, as well as to the restitution of the revenues of his  livings, and there being some demur made, he announced publicly that he  intended to exact this reparation to the uttermost farthing, and set  about collecting all the evidence which was necessary for the success of  a new lawsuit for libel and forgery which he intended to begin. It was  in vain that his friends assured him that the vindication of his  innocence had been complete and brilliant, it was in vain that they  tried to convince him of the danger of driving the vanquished to  despair, Urbain replied that he was ready to endure all the persecutions  which his enemies might succeed in inflicting on him, but as long as he  felt that he had right upon his side he was incapable of drawing back.    Grandier's adversaries soon became conscious of the storm which was  gathering above their heads, and feeling that the struggle between  themselves and this man would be one of life or death, Mignon, Barot,  Meunier, Duthibaut, and Menuau met Trinquant at the village of  Pindadane, in a house belonging to the latter, in order to consult about  the dangers which threatened them. Mignon had, however, already begun to  weave the threads of a new intrigue, which he explained in full to the  others; they lent a favourable ear, and his plan was adopted. We shall  see it unfold itself by degrees, for it is the basis of our narrative.    We have already said that Mignon was the director of the convent of  Ursulines at Loudun: Now the Ursuline order was quite modern, for the  historic controversies to which the slightest mention of the martyrdom  of St. Ursula and her eleven thousand virgins gave rise, had long  hindered the foundation of an order in the saint's honour. However, in  1560 Madame Angele de Bresse established such an order in Italy, with  the same rules as the Augustinian order. This gained the approbation of  Pope Gregory XIII in 1572. In 1614, Madeleine Lhuillier, with the  approval of Pope Paul V, introduced this order into France, by founding  a convent at Paris, whence it rapidly spread over the whole kingdom,  so-that in 1626, only six years before the time when the events just  related took place, a sisterhood was founded in the little town of  Loudun.    Although this community at first consisted entirely of ladies of good  family, daughters of nobles, officers, judges, and the better class of  citizens, and numbered amongst its founders Jeanne de Belfield, daughter  of the late Marquis of Cose, and relative of M. de Laubardemont,  Mademoiselle de Fazili, cousin of the cardinal-duke, two ladies of the  house of Barbenis de Nogaret, Madame de Lamothe, daughter of the Marquis  Lamothe-Barace of Anjou, and Madame d'Escoubleau de Sourdis, of the same  family as the Archbishop of Bordeaux, yet as these nuns had almost all  entered the convent because of their want of fortune, the community  found itself at the time of its establishment richer in blood than in  money, and was obliged instead of building to purchase a private house.  The owner of this house was a certain Moussaut du Frene, whose brother  was a priest. This brother, therefore, naturally became the first  director of these godly women. Less than a year after his appointment he  died, and the directorship became vacant.    The Ursulines had bought the house in which they lived much below its  normal value, for it was regarded as a haunted house by all the town.  The landlord had rightly thought that there was no better way of getting  rid of the ghosts than to confront them with a religious sisterhood, the  members of which, passing their days in fasting and prayer, would be  hardly likely to have their nights disturbed by bad spirits; and in  truth, during the year which they had already passed in the house, no  ghost had ever put in an appearance--a fact which had greatly increased  the reputation of the nuns for sanctity.    When their director died, it so happened that the boarders took  advantage of the occasion to indulge in some diversion at the expense of  the older nuns, who were held in general detestation by the youth of the  establishment on account of the rigour with which they enforced the  rules of the order. Their plan was to raise once more those spirits  which had been, as everyone supposed, permanently relegated to outer  darkness. So noises began to be heard on the roof of the house, which  resolved themselves into cries and groans; then growing bolder, the  spirits entered the attics and garrets, announcing their presence by  clanking of chains; at last they became so familiar that they invaded  the dormitories, where they dragged the sheets off the sisters and  abstracted their clothes.    Great was the terror in the convent, and great the talk in the town, so  that the mother superior called her wisest, nuns around her and asked  them what, in their opinion, would be the best course to take in the  delicate circumstances in which they found themselves. Without a  dissentient voice, the conclusion arrived at was, that the late director  should be immediately replaced by a man still holier than he, if such a  man could be found, and whether because he possessed a reputation for  sanctity, or for some other reason, their choice fell on Urbain  Grandier. When the offer of the post was brought to him, he answered  that he was already responsible for two important charges, and that he  therefore had not enough time to watch over the snow-white flock which  they wished to entrust to him, as a good shepherd should, and he  recommended the lady superior to seek out another more worthy and less  occupied than himself.    This answer, as may be supposed, wounded the self-esteem of the sisters:  they next turned their eyes towards Mignon, priest and canon of the  collegiate church of Sainte-Croix, and he, although he felt deeply hurt  that they had not thought first of him, accepted the position eagerly;  but the recollection that Grandier had been preferred before himself  kept awake in, him one of those bitter hatreds which time, instead of  soothing, intensifies. From the foregoing narrative the reader can see  to what this hate led.    As soon as the new director was appointed, the mother superior confided  to him the kind of foes which he would be expected to vanquish. Instead  of comforting her by the assurance that no ghosts existing, it could not  be ghosts who ran riot in the house, Mignon saw that by pretending to  lay these phantoms he could acquire the reputation for holiness he so  much desired. So he answered that the Holy Scriptures recognised the  existence of ghosts by relating how the witch of Endor had made the  shade of Samuel appear to Saul. He went on to say that the ritual of the  Church possessed means of driving away all evil spirits, no matter how  persistent they were, provided that he who undertook the task were pure  in thought and deed, and that he hoped soon, by the help of God, to rid  the convent of its nocturnal visitants, whereupon as a preparation for  their expulsion he ordered a three days' fast, to be followed by a  general confession.    It does not require any great cleverness to understand how easily Mignon  arrived at the truth by questioning the young penitents as they came  before him. The boarders who had played at being ghosts confessed their  folly, saying that they had been helped by a young novice of sixteen  years of age, named Marie Aubin. She acknowledged that this was true; it  was she who used to get up in the middle of the night, and open the  dormitory door, which her more timid room-mates locked most carefully  from within every night, before going to bed--a fact which greatly  increased their terror when, despite their precautions, the ghosts still  got in. Under pretext of not exposing them to the anger of the superior,  whose suspicions would be sure to be awakened if the apparitions were to  disappear immediately after the general confession, Mignon directed them  to renew their nightly frolics from time to time, but at longer and  longer intervals. He then sought an interview with the superior, and  assured her that he had found the minds of all those under her charge so  chaste and pure that he felt sure through his earnest prayers he would  soon clear the convent of the spirits which now pervaded it.    Everything happened as the director had foretold, and the reputation for  sanctity of the holy man, who by watching and praying had delivered the  worthy Ursulines from their ghostly assailants, increased enormously in  the town of Loudun.          CHAPTER III      Hardly had tranquillity been restored when Mignon, Duthibaut, Menuau,  Meunier, and Barot, having lost their cause before the Archbishop of  Bordeaux, and finding themselves threatened by Grandier with a  prosecution for libel and forgery, met together to consult as to the  best means of defending themselves before the unbending severity of this  man, who would, they felt, destroy them if they did not destroy him.    The result of this consultation was that very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2747"],[0,"Nisida (#4)"],[1,"the island, in a most remote and  lonely spot. Walk at a certain distance, and do not trouble yourself  about me, for I know my part by heart.\"    The young Prince of Brancaleone, whom, in spite of the darkness of the  night, our readers will already have recognised, advanced towards the  fisherman's house, with as little noise as possible, walked up and down  several times upon the shore, and, after having briefly reconnoitred the  place that he wished to attack, waited quietly for the moon to rise and  light up the scene that he had prepared. He was not obliged to exercise  his patience very long, for the darkness gradually disappeared, and  Solomon's little house was bathed in silvery light. Then he approached  with timid steps, lifted towards the casement a look of entreaty, and  began to sigh with all the power of his lungs. The young girl, called  suddenly from her meditations by the appearance of this strange person,  raised herself sharply and prepared to close the shutters.    \"Stay, charming Nisida!\" cried the prince, in the manner of a man  overcome by irresistible passion.    \"What do you want with me, signor?\" answered the maiden, amazed to hear  herself called by name.    \"To adore you as a Madonna is adored, and to make you aware of my  sighs.\"    Nisida looked at him steadily, and, after a moment or two of reflection,  asked suddenly, as though in response to some secret thought, \"Do you  belong to this country, or are you a foreigner?\"    \"I arrived in this island,\" replied the prince without hesitation, \"at  the moment when the sun was writing his farewell to the earth and  dipping the rays that serves as his pen into the shadow that serves as  his inkstand.\"    \"And who are you?\" returned the young girl, not at all understanding  these strange words.    \"Alas! I am but a poor student, but I may become a great poet like  Tasso, whose verses you often hear sung by a departing fisherman who  sends his thrilling music as a last farewell that returns to die on the  beach.\"    \"I do not know whether I am doing wrong to speak to you, but at least I  will be frank with you,\" said Nisida, blushing; \"I have the misfortune  to be the richest girl on the island.\"    \"Your father will not be inexorable,\" returned the prince ardently; \"one  word from you, light of my eyes, goddess of my heart, and I will work  night and day, never pausing nor slackening, and will render myself  worthy to possess the treasure that God has revealed to my dazzled eyes,  and, from being poor and obscure as you see me, I will become rich and  powerful.\"    \"I have stayed too long listening to talk that a maiden should not hear;  permit me, signor, to withdraw.\"    \"Have pity on me, my cruel enemy! What have I done to you that you  should thus leave me with death in my soul? You do not know that, for  months past, I have been following you everywhere like a shadow, that I  prowl round your home at night, stifling my sighs lest they should  disturb your peaceful slumber. You are afraid, perhaps, to let yourself  be touched, at a first meeting, by a poor wretch who adores you. Alas!  Juliet was young and beautiful like you, and she did not need many  entreaties to take pity on Romeo.\"    Nisida suffered a sad and thoughtful look to fall upon this handsome  young man who spoke to her in so gentle a voice, and withdrew without  further reply, that she might not humiliate his poverty.    The prince made great efforts to suppress a strong inclination towards  laughter, and, very well satisfied with this opening, turned his steps  towards the spot where he had left his servant. Trespolo, after having  emptied a bottle of lacryma with which he had provided himself for any  emergency, had looked long around him to choose a spot where the grass  was especially high and thick, and had laid himself down to a sound  sleep, murmuring as he did so, this sublime observation, \"O laziness,  but for the sin of Adam you would be a virtue!\"    The young girl could not close her eyes during the whole night after the  conversation that she had held with the stranger. His sudden appearance,  his strange dress and odd speech, had awakened in her an uncertain  feeling that had been lying asleep in the bottom of her heart. She was  at this time in all the vigour of her youth and of her resplendent  beauty. Nisida was not one of the weak and timid natures that are broken  by suffering or domineered over by tyranny. Far otherwise: everything  around her had contributed towards shaping for her a calm and serene  destiny; her simple, tender soul had unfolded in an atmosphere of peace  and happiness. If she had not hitherto loved, it was the fault, not of  her coldness but of the extreme timidity shown by the inhabitants of her  island. The blind depth of respect that surrounded the old fisherman had  drawn around his daughter a barrier of esteem and submission that no one  dared to cross. By means of thrift and labour Solomon had succeeded in  creating for himself a prosperity that put the poverty of the other  fishermen to the blush. No one had asked for Nisida because no one  thought he deserved her. The only admirer who had dared to show his  passion openly was Bastiano, the most devoted and dearest friend of  Gabriel; but Bastiano did not please her. So, trusting in her beauty,  upheld by the mysterious hope that never deserts youth, she had resigned  herself to wait, like some princess who knows that her betrothed will  come from a far country.    On the day of the Assumption she had left her island for the first time  in her life, chance having chosen her among the maidens of the kingdom  vowed by their mothers to the special protection of the Virgin. But,  overwhelmed by the weight of a position so new to her, blushing and  confused under the eyes of an immense crowd, she had scarcely dared to  raise her wondering looks, and the splendours of the town had passed  before her like a dream, leaving but a vague remembrance.    When she perceived the presence of this handsome young man, so slenderly  and elegantly built, whose noble and calm demeanour contrasted with the  timidity and awkwardness of her other admirers, she felt herself  inwardly disturbed, and no doubt she would have believed that her prince  had come, if she had been unpleasantly struck by the poverty of his  dress. She had, nevertheless, allowed herself to listen to him longer  than she ought to have done, and she drew back with her bosom heavy, her  cheek on fire, and her heart rent by an ache that was both dull and  sharp.    \"If my father does not wish me to marry him,\" she said to herself,  tormented by the first remorseful feeling of her life. \"I shall have  done wrong to speak to him. And yet he is so handsome!\"    Then she knelt before the Virgin, who was her only confidante, the poor  child having never known her mother, and tried to tell her the torments  of her soul; but she could not achieve her prayer. The thoughts became  entangled within her brain, and she surprised herself uttering strange  words. But, assuredly, the Holy Virgin must have taken pity upon her  lovely devotee, for she rose with the impression of a consoling thought,  resolved to confide everything to her father.    \"I cannot have a moment's doubt,\" she said to herself, as she unlaced  her bodice, \"of my father's affection. Well, then, if he forbids me to  speak to him, it will be for my good. And indeed, I have seen him but  this once,\" she added, as she threw herself upon the bed, \"and now I  think of it, I consider him very bold to dare to speak to me. I am  almost inclined to laugh at him. How confidently he brought out his  nonsense, how absurdly he rolled his eyes! They are really very fine,  those eyes of his, and so is his mouth, and his forehead and his hair.  He does not suspect that I noticed his hands, which are really very  white, when he raised them to heaven, like a madman, as he walked up and  down by the sea. Come, come, is he going to prevent my sleeping? I will  not see him again!\" she cried, drawing the sheet over her head like an  angry child. Then she began to laugh to herself over her lover's dress,  and meditated long upon what her companions would say to it. Suddenly  her brow contracted painfully, a frightful thought had stolen into her  mind, she shuddered from head to foot. \"Suppose he were to think someone  else prettier than me? Men are so foolish! Certainly, it is too hot, and  I shall not sleep to-night.\"    Then she sat up in her bed, and continued her monologue--which we will  spare the reader--till the morning. Scarcely had the first rays of light  filtered through the interlacing branches of jasmine and wavered into  the room, when Nisida dressed herself hurriedly, and went as usual to  present her forehead to her father's kiss. The old man at once observed  the depression and weariness left by a sleepless night upon his  daughter's face, and parting with an eager and anxious hand the  beautiful black hair that fell over her cheeks, he asked her, \"What is  the matter, my child? Thou hast not slept well?\"    \"I have not slept at all,\" answered Nisida, smiling, to reassure her  father; \"I am perfectly well, but I have something to confess to you.\"    \"Speak quickly, child; I am dying with impatience.\"    \"Perhaps I have done wrong; but I want you to promise beforehand not to  scold me.\"    \"You know very well that I spoil you,\" said the old man, with a caress;  \"I shall not begin to be stern to-day.\"    \"A young man who does not belong to this island, and whose name I do not  know, spoke to me yesterday evening when I was taking the air at my  window.\"    \"And what was he so eager to say to you, my dear Nisida?\"    \"He begged me to speak to you in his favour.\"    \"I am listening. What can I do for him?\"    \"Order me to marry him.\"    \"And should you obey willingly?\"    \"I think so, father,\" the girl candidly replied. \"As to other things,  you yourself must judge in your"]]]
