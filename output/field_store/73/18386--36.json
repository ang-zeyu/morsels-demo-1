I have been trusted with the shining apples  that I might give them to the Gods only.\"    \"Then I shall take the apples from you,\" said Thiassi the Giant.    He took the basket out of her hands and opened it. But when he touched  the apples they shriveled under his hands. He left them in the basket  and he set the basket down, for he knew now that the apples would be no  good to him unless Iduna gave them to him with her own hands.    \"You must stay with me here until you give me the shining apples,\" he  said to her.    Then was poor Iduna frightened: she was frightened of the strange cave  and frightened of the fire that kept bursting up out of the earth and  she was frightened of the terrible Giant. But above all she was  frightened to think of the evil that would fall upon the Dwellers in  Asgard if she were not there to give them the shining apples to eat.    The Giant came to her again. But still Iduna would not give him the  shining apples. And there in the cave she stayed, the Giant troubling  her every day. And she grew more and more fearful as she saw in her  dreams the Dwellers in Asgard go to her garden--go there, and not being  given the shining apples, feel and see a change coming over themselves  and over each other.    It was as Iduna saw it in her dreams. Every day the Dwellers in Asgard  went to her garden--Odin and Thor, Hoedur and Baldur, Tyr and Heimdall,  Vidar and Vali, with Frigga, Freya, Nanna, and Sif. There was no one to  pluck the apples of their tree. And a change began to come over the Gods  and Goddesses.    They no longer walked lightly; their shoulders became bent; their eyes  no longer were as bright as dewdrops. And when they looked upon one  another they saw the change. Age was coming upon the Dwellers in Asgard.    They knew that the time would come when Frigga would be gray and old;  when Sif's golden hair would fade; when Odin would no longer have his  clear wisdom, and when Thor would not have strength enough to raise and  fling his thunderbolts. And the Dwellers in Asgard were saddened by this  knowledge, and it seemed to them that all brightness had gone from their  shining City.    Where was Iduna whose apples would give back youth and strength and  beauty to the Dwellers in Asgard? The Gods had searched for her through  the World of Men. No trace of her did they find. But now Odin, searching  through his wisdom, saw a means to get knowledge of where Iduna was  hidden.    He summoned his two ravens, Hugin and Munin, his two ravens that flew  through the earth and through the Realm of the Giants and that knew all  things that were past and all things that were to come. He summoned  Hugin and Munin and they came, and one sat on his right shoulder and one  sat on his left shoulder and they told him deep secrets: they told him  of Thiassi and of his desire for the shining apples that the Dwellers in  Asgard ate, and of Loki's deception of Iduna, the fair and simple.    What Odin learnt from his ravens was told in the Council of the Gods.  Then Thor the Strong went to Loki and laid hands upon him. When Loki  found himself in the grip of the strong God, he said, \"What wouldst thou  with me, O Thor?\"    \"I would hurl thee into a chasm in the ground and strike thee with my  thunder,\" said the strong God. \"It was thou who didst bring it about  that Iduna went from Asgard.\"    \"O Thor,\" said Loki, \"do not crush me with thy thunder. Let me stay in  Asgard. I will strive to win Iduna back.\"    \"The judgment of the Gods,\" said Thor, \"is that thou, the cunning one,  shouldst go to Joetunheim, and by thy craft win Iduna back from the  Giants. Go or else I shall hurl thee into a chasm and crush thee with my  thunder.\"    \"I will go,\" said Loki.    From Frigga, the wife of Odin, Loki borrowed the dress of falcon  feathers that she owned. He clad himself in it, and flew to Joetunheim in  the form of a falcon.    He searched through Joetunheim until he found Thiassi's daughter, Skadi.  He flew before Skadi and he let the Giant maid catch him and hold him as  a pet. One day the Giant maid carried him into the cave where Iduna, the  fair and simple, was held.    When Loki saw Iduna there he knew that part of his quest was ended. Now  he had to get Iduna out of Joetunheim and away to Asgard. He stayed no  more with the Giant maid, but flew up into the high rocks of the cave.  Skadi wept for the flight of her pet, but she ceased to search and to  call and went away from the cave.    Then Loki, the doer of good and the doer of evil, flew to where Iduna  was sitting and spoke to her. Iduna, when she knew that one of the  Dwellers in Asgard was near, wept with joy.    Loki told her what she was to do. By the power of a spell that was given  him he was able to change her into the form of a sparrow. But before she  did this she took the shining apples out of her basket and flung them  into places where the Giant would never find them.    Skadi, coming back to the cave, saw the falcon fly out with the sparrow  beside him. She cried out to her father and the Giant knew that the  falcon was Loki and the sparrow was Iduna. He changed himself into the  form of a mighty eagle. By this time sparrow and falcon were out of  sight, but Thiassi, knowing that he could make better flight than they,  flew toward Asgard.    Soon he saw them. They flew with all the power they had, but the great  wings of the eagle brought him nearer and nearer to them. The Dwellers  in Asgard, standing on the wall, saw the falcon and the sparrow with the  great eagle pursuing them. They knew who they were--Loki and Iduna with  Thiassi in pursuit.    As they watched the eagle winging nearer and nearer, the Dwellers in  Asgard were fearful that the falcon and the sparrow would be caught upon  and that Iduna would be taken again by Thiassi. They lighted great fires  upon the wall, knowing that Loki would find a way through the fires,  bringing Iduna with him, but that Thiassi would not find a way.    The falcon and the sparrow flew toward the fires. Loki went between the  flames and brought Iduna with him. And Thiassi, coming up to the fires  and finding no way through, beat his wings against the flames. He fell  down from the wall and the death that came to him afterwards was laid to  Loki.    Thus Iduna was brought back to Asgard. Once again she sat in the golden  house that opened to her garden, once again she plucked the shining  apples off the tree she tended, and once again she gave them to the  Dwellers in Asgard. And the Dwellers in Asgard walked lightly again, and  brightness came into their eyes and into their cheeks; age no more  approached them; youth came back; light and joy were again in Asgard.          [Illustration]    SIF'S GOLDEN HAIR: HOW LOKI WROUGHT MISCHIEF IN ASGARD      All who dwelt in Asgard, the AEsir and the Asyniur, who were the Gods and  the Goddesses, and the Vanir, who were the friends of the Gods and the  Goddesses, were wroth with Loki. It was no wonder they were wroth with  him, for he had let the Giant Thiassi carry off Iduna and her golden  apples. Still, it must be told that the show they made of their wrath  made Loki ready to do more mischief in Asgard.    One day he saw a chance to do mischief that made his heart rejoice. Sif,  the wife of Thor, was lying asleep outside her house. Her beautiful  golden hair flowed all round her. Loki knew how much Thor loved that  shining hair, and how greatly Sif prized it because of Thor's love.  Here was his chance to do a great mischief. Smilingly, he took out his  shears and he cut off the shining hair, every strand and every tress.  She did not waken while her treasure was being taken from her. But Loki  left Sif's head cropped and bare.    Thor was away from Asgard. Coming back to the City of the Gods, he went  into his house. Sif, his wife, was not there to welcome him. He called  to Sif, but no glad answer came from her. To the palaces of all the Gods  and Goddesses Thor went, but in none of them did he find Sif, his  golden-haired wife.    When he was coming back to his house he heard his name whispered. He  stopped, and then a figure stole out from behind a stone. A veil covered  her head, and Thor scarce knew that this was Sif, his wife. As he went  to her she sobbed and sobbed. \"O Thor, my husband,\" she said, \"do not  look upon me. I am ashamed that you should see me. I shall go from  Asgard and from the company of the Gods and Goddesses, and I shall go  down to Svartheim and live amongst the Dwarfs. I cannot bear that any of  the Dwellers in Asgard should look upon me now.\"    \"O Sif,\" cried Thor, \"what has happened to change you?\"    \"I have lost the hair of my head,\" said Sif, \"I have lost the beautiful  golden hair that you, Thor, loved. You will not love me any more, and so  I must go away, down to Svartheim and to the company of the Dwarfs. They  are as ugly as I am now.\"    Then she took the veil off her head and Thor saw that all her beautiful  hair was gone. She stood before him, shamed and sorrowful, and he grew  into a mighty rage. \"Who was it did this to you, Sif?\" he said. \"I am  Thor, the strongest of all the Dwellers in Asgard, and I shall see to it  that all the powers the Gods possess will be used to get your fairness  back. Come with me, Sif.\" And taking his wife's hand in his, Thor went  off to the Council House where the Gods and the Goddesses were.    Sif covered her head with her veil, for she would not have the Gods and  Goddesses look upon her shorn head. But from the anger in Thor's eyes  all saw that the wrong done to Sif was great indeed. Then Thor told of  the cutting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24750"],[0,"Mizora: A Prophecy (#4)"],[1,"to  destroy the charm it had for the eye; but when I saw it removed by pink  tipped fingers, whose beauty no art could represent, and saw it  disappear within such tempting lips. I thought the feaster worthy of the  feast. Fruit appeared to be the principal part of their diet, and was  served in its natural state. I was, however, supplied with something  that resembled beefsteak of a very fine quality. I afterward learned  that it was chemically prepared meat. At the close of the meal, a cup  was handed me that looked like the half of a soap bubble with all its  iridescent beauty sparkling and glancing in the light. It contained a  beverage that resembled chocolate, but whose flavor could not have been  surpassed by the fabled nectar of the gods.          CHAPTER III.      I have been thus explicit in detailing the circumstances of my entrance  into the land of Mizora, or, in other words, the interior of the earth,  lest some incredulous person might doubt the veracity of this narrative.    It does seem a little astonishing that a woman should have fallen by  accident, and without intention or desire, upon a discovery that  explorers and scientists had for years searched for in vain. But such  was the fact, and, in generosity, I have endeavored to make my accident  as serviceable to the world in general, and Science in particular, as I  could, by taking observations of the country, its climate and products,  and especially its people.    I met with the greatest difficulty in acquiring their language.  Accustomed to the harsh dialect of the North, my voice was almost  intractable in obtaining their melodious accentuation. It was,  therefore, many months before I mastered the difficulty sufficiently to  converse without embarrassment, or to make myself clearly understood.  The construction of their language was simple and easily understood, and  in a short time I was able to read it with ease, and to listen to it  with enjoyment. Yet, before this was accomplished, I had mingled among  them for months, listening to a musical jargon of conversation, that I  could neither participate in, nor understand. All that I could therefore  discover about them during this time, was by observation. This soon  taught me that I was not in a seminary--in our acceptance of the  term--but in a College of Experimental Science. The ladies--girls I had  supposed them to be--were, in fact, women and mothers, and had reached  an age that with us would be associated with decrepitude, wrinkles and  imbecility. They were all practical chemists, and their work was the  preparation of food from the elements. No wonder that they possessed the  suppleness and bloom of eternal youth, when the earthy matter and  impurities that are ever present in our food, were unknown to theirs.    I also discovered that they obtained rain artificially when needed, by  discharging vast quantities of electricity in the air. I discovered that  they kept no cattle, nor animals of any kind for food or labor. I  observed a universal practice of outdoor exercising; the aim seeming to  be to develop the greatest capacity of lung or muscle. It was  astonishing the amount of air a Mizora lady could draw into her lungs.  They called it their brain stimulant, and said that their faculties were  more active after such exercise. In my country, a cup of strong coffee,  or some other agreeable beverage, is usually taken into the stomach to  invigorate or excite the mind.    One thing I remarked as unusual among a people of such cultured taste,  and that was the size of the ladies' waists. Of all that I measured not  one was less than thirty inches in circumference, and it was rare to  meet with one that small. At first I thought a waist that tapered from  the arm pits would be an added beauty, if only these ladies would be  taught how to acquire it. But I lived long enough among them to look  upon a tapering waist as a disgusting deformity. They considered a large  waist a mark of beauty, as it gave a greater capacity of lung power; and  they laid the greatest stress upon the size and health of the lungs. One  little lady, not above five feet in height, I saw draw into her lungs  two hundred and twenty-five cubic inches of air, and smile proudly when  she accomplished it. I measured five feet and five inches in height, and  with the greatest effort I could not make my lungs receive more than two  hundred cubic inches of air. In my own country I had been called an  unusually robust girl, and knew, by comparison, that I had a much larger  and fuller chest than the average among women.    I noticed with greater surprise than anything else had excited in me,  the marked absence of men. I wandered about the magnificent building  without hindrance or surveillance. There was not a lock or bolt on any  door in it. I frequented a vast gallery filled with paintings and  statues of women, noble looking, beautiful women, but still--nothing but  women. The fact that they were all blondes, singular as it might appear,  did not so much impress me. Strangers came and went, but among the  multitude of faces I met, I never saw a man's.    In my own country I had been accustomed to regard man as a vital  necessity. He occupied all governmental offices, and was the arbitrator  of domestic life. It seemed, therefore, impossible to me for a country  or government to survive without his assistance and advice. Besides, it  was a country over which the heart of any man must yearn, however  insensible he might be to beauty or female loveliness. Wealth was  everywhere and abundant. The climate as delightful as the most  fastidious could desire. The products of the orchards and gardens  surpassed description. Bread came from the laboratory, and not from the  soil by the sweat of the brow. Toil was unknown; the toil that we know,  menial, degrading and harassing. Science had been the magician that had  done away all that. Science, so formidable and austere to our untutored  minds, had been gracious to these fair beings and opened the door to  nature's most occult secrets. The beauty of those women it is not in my  power to describe. The Greeks, in their highest art, never rivalled it,  for here was a beauty of mind that no art can represent. They enhanced  their physical charms with attractive costumes, often of extreme  elegance. They wore gems that flashed a fortune as they passed. The  rarest was of a pale rose color, translucent as the clearest water, and  of a brilliancy exceeding the finest diamond. Their voices, in song,  could only be equaled by a celestial choir. No dryad queen ever floated  through the leafy aisles of her forest with more grace than they  displayed in every movement. And all this was for feminine eyes  alone--and they of the most enchanting loveliness.    Among all the women that I met during my stay in Mizora--comprising a  period of fifteen years--I saw not one homely face or ungraceful form.  In my own land the voice of flattery had whispered in my ear praises of  face and figure, but I felt ill-formed and uncouth beside the perfect  symmetry and grace of these lovely beings. Their chief beauty appeared  in a mobility of expression. It was the divine fire of Thought that  illumined every feature, which, while gazing upon the Aphrodite of  Praxitiles, we must think was all that the matchless marble lacked.  Emotion passed over their features like ripples over a stream. Their  eyes were limpid wells of loveliness, where every impulse of their  natures were betrayed without reserve.    \"It would be a paradise for man.\"    I made this observation to myself, and as secretly would I propound the  question:    \"Why is he not here in lordly possession?\"    In _my_ world man was regarded, or he had made himself regarded, as a  superior being. He had constituted himself the Government, the Law,  Judge, Jury and Executioner. He doled out reward or punishment as his  conscience or judgment dictated. He was active and belligerent always in  obtaining and keeping every good thing for himself. He was  indispensable. Yet here was a nation of fair, exceedingly fair women  doing without him, and practising the arts and sciences far beyond the  imagined pale of human knowledge and skill.    Of their progress in science I will give some accounts hereafter.    It is impossible to describe the feeling that took possession of me as  months rolled by, and I saw the active employments of a prosperous  people move smoothly and quietly along in the absence of masculine  intelligence and wisdom. Cut off from all inquiry by my ignorance of  their language, the singular absence of the male sex began to prey upon  my imagination as a mystery. The more so after visiting a town at some  distance, composed exclusively of schools and colleges for the youth of  the country. Here I saw hundreds of children--_and all of them were  girls_. Is it to be wondered at that the first inquiry I made, was:    \"Where are the men?\"          CHAPTER IV.      To facilitate my progress in the language of Mizora I was sent to their  National College. It was the greatest favor they could have conferred  upon me, as it opened to me a wide field of knowledge. Their educational  system was a peculiar one, and, as it was the chief interest of the  country. I shall describe it before proceeding farther with this  narrative.    All institutions for instruction were public, as were, also, the books  and other accessories. The State was the beneficent mother who furnished  everything, and required of her children only their time and  application. Each pupil was compelled to attain a certain degree of  excellence that I thought unreasonably high, after which she selected  the science or vocation she felt most competent to master, and to that  she then devoted herself.    The salaries of teachers were larger than those of any other public  position. The Principal of the National College had an income that  exceeded any"]]]
