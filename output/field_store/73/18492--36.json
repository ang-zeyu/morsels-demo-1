Processes which in childhood were entirely devoid of any  sexual tinge, but which later became associated with sex-feelings, very  readily acquire false sexual associations also when they are revived in  memory. Consider, for instance, the case of a homosexual man. He  remembers that, as a small boy, he was very fond of sitting on his  uncle's knees, and he believes that the pleasure he formerly experienced  was tinged by sexual feeling. In reality this was by no means the case.  His uncle took the boy on his knee in order to tell him a story.  Possibly, also, the riding movements which the uncle imitated by jogging  his knees up and down gave the child pleasure, which, however, was  entirely devoid of any admixture of sexual feeling. But in the  consciousness of the full-grown man, in whom homosexual feeling has  later undergone full development, all this becomes distorted. The  non-sexual motives are forgotten; he believes that even in early  childhood he had homosexual inclinations, and that for _this_ reason it  gave him pleasure to ride on his uncle's knees.    Nor is observation in any way adapted to furnish us with a clear picture  of the sexual life of the child. So little can be directly observed,  that in the absence of reports much would remain entirely unknown. From  the moment when the children gain a consciousness, however obscure, of  the nature of sexual processes, they almost invariably endeavour to  conceal their knowledge as much as possible, so that we shall discover  its existence only by a rare chance. None the less, the results of  direct observation are often important; sometimes because we are able to  watch children when they are unaware of our attention, and sometimes  because they do not as yet fully understand the nature of the processes  under observation, and for this reason are less secretive.    The third method, that of experiment, is available to us only in the  form of castration. I need not dilate on the inadequacy of this  application of the experimental method, even apart from the fact that it  subserves our purposes almost exclusively in respect of the male  sex--for in the case of young girls, castration (oophorectomy) is almost  entirely unknown.    Thus we see that all our methods of investigation exhibit extensive  lacunae, and further, that they are all in many respects fallacious; we  shall therefore endeavour to supplement each by the others, in order to  arrive at results which shall be as free from error as possible. Thus  guided, we learn that sexual incidents occur in childhood far more  frequently than is usually supposed. So common are they, that they  cannot possibly escape the notice of any practising physician or  educationalist who pays attention to the question, provided, of course,  that he enjoys the confidence of the parents. These latter have often  been aware of such sexual manifestations in their children for a long  time, but a false shame has prevented them from asking the advice of the  physician. They have been afraid lest he should regard the child as  intellectually or morally deficient, or as the offspring of a degenerate  family. In addition, we have to take into account self-deception on the  part of the parents, who, indeed, often deceive themselves willingly,  saying to themselves that the matter is of no importance, and that the  symptoms will disappear spontaneously.    Having given this brief account of the terminology to be employed and of  the methods of investigation, I propose to sketch no less briefly the  history of the subject.      Casual references to the sexual life of the child are to be found even  in the older scientific literature. In the latter half of the eighteenth  century, and at the beginning of the nineteenth, interest in the subject  became more general. Two works, in especial, published almost  simultaneously, attracted the attention of physicians and  educationalists. One of these, Rousseau's _Emile_, discusses the proper  conduct of parents and elders in relation to the awakening sexual life,  and what they should do in order to delay that awakening as much as  possible. The other, the celebrated work of Tissot, depicts the dangers  of masturbation, but deals chiefly with persons who have attained sexual  maturity. None the less, in consequence of this book, much attention was  directed to the sexual life of the child. Earlier works on masturbation,  such as that of Sarganeck, for instance, had not succeeded in arousing  any enduring interest in this question. But Rousseau's and Tissot's  books induced a large number of physicians and educationalists to occupy  themselves in this province of study. Thus at this early day many  authorities were led to advocate the sexual enlightenment of children,  in order to guide them in the avoidance of the dangers of the sexual  life. An excellent historical and critical study of this movement,  written by Thalhofer, has recently been published.[4] Among the  educationalists who took part in it may be mentioned Basedow, Salzmann,  Campe, and Niemeyer. The modern movement in favour of sexual  enlightenment originated chiefly in the endeavour to prevent the  diffusion of venereal diseases; but the earlier movement, occurring at a  time when much less was known about venereal diseases, had a different  aim. This was rather to prevent masturbation and other sexual excesses,  on account of their direct effect upon the organism; an aim not  neglected by the modern movement for sexual enlightenment, though  subsidiary to the object of the prevention of the venereal diseases.  Teachers of that day touched, of course, upon the subject of the sexual  life of the child. But this was done cursorily, for when instruction was  given on the sexual life, not the actual experience of children, but the  sexual life of mature persons, was the subject of discourse. This must  be said also of the works of those physicians who, like Hufeland in his  _Makrobiotik_ (written as a sequel to the work of Tissot), spoke of the  dangers of masturbation.    A few of the numerous medical books dealing with the puberal development  deserve mention in this place; for instance, Marro, _La Puberta_ (first  edition, published in 1897), and Bacque, _La Puberte_ (Argenteuil,  1876). A number of recent works on masturbation have also touched on the  topic of the sexual life of the child.    Apart from these recent special investigations, the older and the more  recent medical and anthropological literature contains numerous  observations which concern the subject of this book. More especially do  we find reports of cases in which the external manifestations of sexual  maturity appeared in very early childhood. Now we find an account of a  girl menstruating at four years of age, now an account of a  three-year-old boy who exhibited many of the external signs of sexual  maturity. Even in the older, purely psychological works we find  occasional references to the sexual life of the child--a fact that will  surprise no one who is acquainted with the high development of the  empirical psychology (_Erfahrungspsychologie_) of that day (1800). The  _Venus Urania_ of Ramdohr, for instance, a work on the psychology of  love, emphasises the frequency of amatory sentiments in children.    In works dealing with the history of civilisation, we also encounter  occasional references to our subject. Take, for instance, the knightly  _Code of Love_ (_Liebeskodex_), a work highly esteemed in the days of  chivalry, and legendarily supposed to have originated in King Arthur's  Court. Paragraph 6 of this _Code_ runs: \"A man shall not practise love  until he is fully grown.\" According to Rudeck,[5] from whom I quote this  instance, the aim of the admonition was to protect the youth of the  nobility from unwholesome consequences. Obviously, the love affairs of  immature persons must have been the determining cause of any allusion to  the matter. We may also draw attention in this connexion to many  marriage laws, which show that the subject has come under consideration,  either because they expressly sanction the marriages of children, or,  conversely, because they forbid such unions. At the present day, among  many peoples (as, for instance, the Hindus), child-marriages are  frequent; and in many countries in which such marriages are now illegal,  they were sanctioned in former ages. Many works on prostitution also  touch on our chosen subject. Parent-Duchatelet, in his great book,  refers to girls who had become prostitutes at the ages of twelve or even  ten years. I shall show later that in individual instances such early  prostitution is directly dependent upon the sexuality of the children  concerned. Many ethnological works also contribute to our knowledge of  the sexual life of the child, describing, as they do, in certain races,  the early awakening of sexual activity.    Remarkably little material do we find, however, in many works in which  we might have expected to find a great deal. I refer to works on  education and on the psychology of the child. In exceptional instances,  indeed, as I have already indicated, the educationalists have taken part  in the movement in favour of sexual enlightenment. But when we consider  the enormous importance and great frequency of the sexual processes of  the child, we are positively astounded at the manner in which this  department of knowledge has been ignored by those who have written on  the science and art of education, and by those psychologists who have  occupied themselves in the study of the mind of the child. Has it been a  false notion of morality by which these investigators have been withheld  from the elucidation of the sexual life of the child? Or has the reason  merely been their defective powers of observation? As a matter of fact,  I suppose that both these causes have operated in producing this  remarkable "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#4)"],[1,"him from  carrying on his chemical experiments, and he besides suffered the  indignity of a personal assault. Tycho Brahe resolved to quit his  ungrateful country and seek a home in some foreign land, where he should  be permitted to pursue his studies unmolested and live in quietness and  peace. He accordingly removed from the island of Huen all his  instruments and appliances that were of a portable nature, and packed  them on board a vessel which he hired for the purpose of transport, and,  having embarked with his family, his servants, and some of his pupils  and assistants, 'this interesting barque, freighted with the glory of  Denmark,' set sail from Copenhagen about the end of 1597, and having  crossed the Baltic in safety, arrived at Rostock, where Tycho found some  old friends waiting to receive him. He was now in doubt as to where he  should find a home, when the Austrian Emperor Rudolph, himself a liberal  patron of science and the fine arts, having heard of Tycho Brahe's  misfortunes, sent him an invitation to take up his abode in his  dominions, and promised that he should be treated in a manner worthy of  his reputation and fame.    Tycho resolved to accept the Emperor's kind invitation, and in the  spring of 1599 arrived at Prague, where he found a handsome residence  prepared for his reception.    He was received by the Emperor in a most cordial manner and treated with  the greatest kindness. An annual pension of three thousand crowns was  settled upon him for life, and he was to have his choice of several  residences belonging to his Majesty, where he might reside and erect a  new observatory. From among these he selected the Castle of Benach, in  Bohemia, which was situated on an elevated plateau and commanded a wide  view of the horizon.    During his residence at Benach Tycho received a visit from Kepler, who  stayed with him for several months in order that he might carry out some  astronomical observations. In the following year Kepler returned, and  took up his permanent residence with Tycho, having been appointed  assistant in his observatory, a post which, at Tycho's request, was  conferred upon him by the Emperor.    Tycho Brahe soon discovered that his ignorance of the language and  unfamiliarity with the customs of the people caused him much  inconvenience. He therefore asked permission from the Emperor to be  allowed to remove to Prague. This request was readily granted, and a  suitable residence was provided for him in the city.    In the meantime his family, his large instruments, and other property,  having arrived at Prague, Tycho was soon comfortably settled in his new  home.    Though Tycho Brahe continued his astronomical observations, yet he could  not help feeling that he lived among a strange people; nor did the  remembrance of his sufferings and the cruel treatment he received at the  hands of his fellow-countrymen subdue the affection which he cherished  towards his native land. Pondering over the past, he became despondent  and low-spirited; a morbid imagination caused him to brood over small  troubles, and gloomy, melancholy thoughts possessed his mind--symptoms  which seemed to presage the approach of some serious malady. One  evening, when visiting at the house of a friend, he was seized with a  painful illness, to which he succumbed in less than a fortnight. He died  at Prague on October 24, 1601, when in his fifty-fifth year.    The Emperor Rudolph, when informed of Tycho Brahe's death, expressed his  deep regret, and commanded that he should be interred in the principal  church in the city, and that his obsequies should be celebrated with  every mark of honour and respect.    Tycho Brahe stands out as the most romantic and prominent figure in the  history of astronomy. His independence of character, his ardent  attachments, his strong hatreds, and his love of splendour, are  characteristics which distinguish him from all other men of his age.  This remarkable man was an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist; but in  his latter years he renounced astrology, and believed that the stars  exercised no influence over the destinies of mankind.    As a practical astronomer, Tycho Brahe has not been excelled by any  other observer of the heavens. The magnificence of his observatory at  Huen, upon the equipment and embellishment of which it is stated he  expended a ton of gold; the splendour and variety of his instruments,  and his ingenuity in inventing new ones, would alone have made him  famous. But it was by the skill and assiduity with which he carried out  his numerous and important observations that he has earned for himself a  position of the most honourable distinction among astronomers. In his  investigation of the Lunar theory Tycho Brahe discovered the Moon's  _annual equation_, a yearly effect produced by the Sun's disturbing  force as the Earth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit. He also  discovered another inequality in the Moon's motion, called the  _variation_. He determined with greater exactness astronomical  refractions from an altitude of 45 deg. downwards to the horizon, and  constructed a catalogue of 777 stars. He also made a vast number of  observations on planets, which formed the basis of the 'Rudolphine  Tables,' and were of invaluable assistance to Kepler in his  investigation of the laws relating to planetary motion.    Tycho Brahe declined to accept the Copernican theory, and devised a  system of his own, which he called the 'Tychonic.' By this arrangement  the Earth remained stationary, whilst all the planets revolved round  the Sun, who in his turn completed a daily revolution round the Earth.  All the phenomena associated with the motions of those bodies could be  explained by means of this system; but it did not receive much support,  and after the Copernican theory became better understood it was given  up, and heard of no more.    We now arrive at the name of KEPLER, one of the very greatest of  astronomers, and a man of remarkable genius, who was the first to  discover the real nature of the paths pursued by the Earth and planets  in their revolution round the Sun. After seventeen years of close  observation, he announced that those bodies travelled round the Sun in  elliptical or oval orbits, and not in circular paths, as was believed by  Copernicus. In his investigation of the laws which govern the motions of  the planets he formulated those famous theorems known as 'Kepler's  Laws,' which will endure for all time as a proof of his sagacity and  surpassing genius. Prior to the discovery of those laws the Sun, though  acknowledged to be the centre of the system, did not appear to occupy a  central position as regards the motions of the planets; but Kepler, by  demonstrating that the planes of the orbits of all the planets, and the  lines connecting their apsides, passed through the Sun, was enabled to  assign the orb his true position with regard to those bodies.    JOHN KEPLER was born at Weil, in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, December 21,  1571. His parents, though of noble family, lived in reduced  circumstances, owing to causes for which they were themselves chiefly  responsible. In his youth Kepler suffered so much from ill-health that  his education had to be neglected. In 1586 he was sent to a monastic  school at Maulbronn, which had been established at the Reformation, and  was under the patronage of the Duke of Wurtemberg. Afterwards he studied  at the University of Tubingen, where he distinguished himself and took a  degree. Kepler devoted his attention chiefly to science and mathematics,  but paid no particular attention to the study of astronomy. Maestlin,  the professor of mathematics, whose lectures he attended, upheld the  Copernican theory, and Kepler, who adopted the views of his teacher,  wrote an essay in favour of the diurnal rotation of the Earth, in which  he supported the more recent astronomical doctrines. In 1594, a vacancy  having occurred in the professorship of astronomy at Gratz consequent  upon the death of George Stadt, Kepler was appointed his successor. He  did not seek this office, as he felt no particular desire to take up the  study of astronomy, but was recommended by his tutors as a man well  fitted for the post. He was thus in a manner compelled to devote his  time and talents to the science of astronomy. Kepler directed his  attention to three subjects--viz. 'the number, the size, and the motion  of the orbits of the planets.' He endeavoured to ascertain if any  regular proportion existed between the sizes of the planetary orbits, or  in the difference of their sizes, but in this he was unsuccessful. He  then thought that, by imagining the existence of a planet between Mars  and Jupiter, and another between Venus and Mercury, he might be able to  attain his object; but he found that this assumption afforded him no  assistance. Kepler then imagined that as there were five regular  geometrical solids, and five planets, the distances of the latter were  regulated by the size of the solids described round one another. The  discovery afterwards of two additional planets testified to the  absurdity of this speculation. A description of these extraordinary  researches was published, in 1596, in a work entitled 'Prodromus of  Cosmographical Dissertations; containing the cosmographical mystery  respecting the admirable proportion of the celestial orbits, and the  genuine and real causes of the number, magnitude, and periods of the  planets, demonstrated by the five regular geometrical solids.' This  volume, notwithstanding the fanciful speculations which it contained,  was received with much favour by astronomers, and both Tycho Brahe and  Galileo encouraged Kepler to continue his researches. Galileo admired  his ingenuity, and Tycho advised him 'to lay a solid foundation for his  views by actual observation, and then, by ascending from these, to  strive to reach the causes of things.'
