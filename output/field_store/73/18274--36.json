The king's wrath when he heard a tale of women and orphans  wronged or robbed or evilly treated by proud or powerful lords and  knights, was terrible to see. Many were the pale captives he released  from their deep dungeons, many were the tears he wiped away, and hard  and heavy was his punishment of evil lords who thought their power  would for ever shield them from penalty for their cruelties and  oppression.    When this was done, he caused a proclamation to be uttered, that he  would hold his coronation at the city of Caerleon-upon-Usk, at the  feast of Hallow-mass then following; and he commanded all his loyal  subjects to attend. When the time came, all the countryside on the  marches of Wales was filled with the trains of noblemen and their  knights and servants gathering towards the city.    As Arthur looked from the window of the palace which the Romans had  builded, and which looked far and wide over the crowded roads, word was  brought to him that six of the kings who had resented his kingship had  come to the city. At this Arthur was glad, for he was full gentle and  kindly, and would liefer be friendly with a man than his enemy.    Thinking that these kings and knights had come for love of him, and to  do him worship at his feast, King Arthur sent them many and rich  presents. But his messengers returned, saying that the kings and  knights had received them with insults, and had refused to take the  gifts of a beardless boy who had come, they said, of low blood.    Whereat the king's eyes flashed grimly, but at that time he said no  word.    In the joustings and knightly games that were part of the festival of  the coronation, the six kings ever ranged themselves against King  Arthur and his knights, and did him all the despite they could achieve.  At that time they deemed themselves not strong enough to hurt the king,  and therefore did no open act of revolt.    Now it happened, when the feasting was over and many of the kings and  lords had departed home again, that Arthur stood in the door of his  hall that looked into the street, and with his three best nobles, Sir  Kay, Sir Bedevere and Sir Baudwin, he watched the rich cavalcades of  his lords pass out of the town. Suddenly, as he stood there, a little  page-boy, fair of face but for the pitiful sorrow and gauntness upon  it, dashed from the throng of a lord's retinue which was passing and  threw himself along the ground, his hands clutching the feet of the  king.    'O King Arthur, save me!' the lad cried, spent of breath, 'or this evil  lord will slay me as he hath slain my mother and my brothers.'    From the throng a tall black knight, leaping from his horse, strode  towards the boy, and would have torn his hands from their hold upon the  king's feet.    'Back, sir knight!' said the king. 'I will hear more of this. Who are  you?'    The knight laughed insolently.    'I? Oh, I am one that the last king knew well to his sorrow. I am  Turquine, brother to Sir Caradoc of the Dolorous Tower.'    'What is this boy to you?'    'He is Owen, the caitiff son of a brave father, who gave him to my care  to train in knightly ways. But 'tis a puling fool, more fitting for the  bowers of ladies.'    'Nay, king, he lies!' said the lad who kneeled before the king. 'I am  his nephew. His hand slew my dear father treacherously, and he hath  starved my mother to her death. For our lands are rich while his are  poor, and my father warned me of him ere he died. This man hath kept me  prisoner, used me evilly, starving me and wealing me with cruel blows  daily. I think he hath my death in his heart.'    'I can speak of this thing,' said a knight, who came forth from the  throng. 'I am Sir Miles of Bandon. I know this lad speaks truth, for  his father was mine own dear cousin. This Sir Turquine is a felon  knight.'    The brow of the king went dark. He looked from the cruel insolent face  of the black knight to the wan beseeching face of the lad.    'Hark ye!' said Arthur to Turquine, and his voice was terrible, for all  that it was very quiet, 'ye shall answer to me and my justice for any  evil you have done this young boy or his people. When I send for thee,  come at once, or it will be worse for thee. The boy stays with me. Now  begone!'    The big knight looked with hatred and surprise in his eyes, and for a  while said naught. Then, with an insolent laugh, he turned and vaulted  on his horse.    'I may come when thou dost not expect me, sir king!' he said, mocking,  and shot an evil look at the young page.    Thenceforward the young page Owen stayed in the court, doing his  services deftly and quietly, with an eye ever on the king to do his  bidding. One night, when a storm raged and the town lay dark and quiet,  King Arthur sat in his hall. Sir Kay and Sir Bedevere told tales, or  the king's bard sang songs to amuse him, while about them moved young  Owen, noiseless of step, quick of eye, and as restless as an unquiet  spirit.    Anon the lad would pass through the arras, creep to the great outer  door, and look at the porter in his room beside it. Then he would stand  at the wicket and listen to the rare footsteps pass down the road, and  when the rising wind keened and shrilled through the crannies, he would  glance about him with quick looks as if in fear of an enemy.    Once he went to Falk, the king's porter, and said:    ''Tis a stormy night, Sir Falk. I doubt few are about the streets of  Caerleon on such a night.'    'Few indeed,' said Falk.    'Yet methought but now I heard the rattle of a bridle in the distance,  as if a steed stood in armour.'    'I heard naught,' said Falk. ''Twould be but the grinding of a chain  beside a horseblock.'    Young Owen went away, and sat where the king and his knights listened  to the marvellous tales of the wise Gildas, who told of most terrible  witches and warlocks in the wizard woods of Brittany.    Again the lad approached the door and listened; then going to the  porter he said:    'This drenching storm will tear the last poor leaves from the forest  trees, I ween, Sir Falk.'    'Of a truth,' said the porter, ''tis overlate for leaves. They be stuck  in the mire of the rides long ere this.'    'They could not be blown so far in this gushing storm,' said the page,  'and therefore I have deceived myself. But I thought I heard the rustle  of leaves on the stones before the door but now.'    'It could not be,' said the porter; 'it was doubtless the gouts of  water from the roof of the hall thou didst hear.'    Owen went away, but in a little while returned, and softly opened the  wicket panel in the door a little way, and looked forth into the  roaring darkness of rain and wind.    'Think you, Sir Falk,' he said, going to the porter, 'that the witches  from the woods of Denn do send their baleful fires on such a night as  this to lead poor houseless wretches into the marsh below the wall?'    The porter laughed.    'Thou'rt over-full of fancies to-night, young sir,' he said. 'Have no  fear of witches. We're all safe and sound here till the blessed  daylight comes, and none need stir out till then.'    'Methought I saw a flash in the dark but now,' said Owen, 'as if 'twas  the gleam of a sword or a wandering marsh fire.'    'Not a doubt 'twas but a lightning flash,' returned the porter. 'Now go  ye, for I hear the king moving towards bed. Sleep soundly, lad; no need  to fear this night.'    In a little while the palace was sunk in darkness, and in silence save  for the smothered cries of sleepers in their dreams. Outside, the rain  still sobbed at the eaves, and the wind beat at the narrow casements.  Time passed, and for all his weariness young Owen could not sleep.    His spirit had been heavy all the day, and vague and dreadful fears had  haunted him. Something told him that the life of the beloved king, who  had taken him from the foul and cruel power of Sir Turquine, was  threatened. He rose in the dark from his pallet of straw in the hall  where lay the other pages, and stole softly out. He would make his way  to the king's door, and, wrapped in his cloak, would lie before it.    He felt his way softly along the corridor in the deep darkness.  Suddenly he stopped. Something alive was near him in the dark. Even as  he turned, a hand seized him by the throat, and a hateful voice which  he knew growled in his ear:    'Lead us to the king's room, or this shall sink in thy heart!'    He knew at once that all his fears of the day and the night had been  true. He had indeed heard the stealthy footsteps before the door of the  hall, and had seen the dull gleam of a sword in the hand of one of  those who lay in wait to murder the king.    'Speak!' said the voice again. 'Is the king's room backward or  forward?'    'I will not tell thee!' he gasped, and heard a low mocking laugh.    ''Tis thee, my caitiff boy!' sneered Sir Turquine, for he it was. 'Then  this for thee!'    With the words he thrust his dagger into the body of the struggling  boy, who swooned and dropped to the floor.    In a few moments Owen stirred, for his struggles had caused his enemy's  dagger to swerve, and though weak from loss of blood, the young page  knew that he must act at once to save his hero from the murderous  knives.    He heard the stealthy footsteps of the murderers going backwards to the  hall, and, filled with joy, he pressed forward. His head was dizzy, he  felt as if every moment he must sink in a swoon; but at length he  reached the door, turned the handle and fell in.    'The king!' he cried. 'Save the king! Turquine has broken in and seeks  his life.'    At his shrill cry there was the rush of men and torches along the  corridors and into the room. Sir Bedevere was at the head of them, and  in a moment he, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#4)"],[1," modernized the date  from the Old Style.]    1589. In November Lord Burghley directed the Lord Mayor to \"give order  for the stay of all plays within the city.\" In reply the Lord Mayor  wrote:         According to which your Lordship's good pleasure, I       presently sent for such players as I could hear of; so as       there appeared yesterday before me the Lord Strange's       Players, to whom I specially gave in charge and required       them in Her Majesty's name to forbear playing until further       order might be given for their allowance in that respect.       Whereupon the Lord Admiral's Players very dutifully obeyed;       but the others, in very contemptuous manner departing from       me, went to the Cross Keys and played that afternoon.[18]    [Footnote 18: _Lansdowne MSS._ 60, quoted by Collier, _History of  English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), I, 265.]    1594. On October 8, Henry, Lord Hunsdon, the Lord Chamberlain and the  patron of Shakespeare's company, wrote to the Lord Mayor:         After my hearty commendations. Where my now company of       players have been accustomed for the better exercise of       their quality, and for the service of Her Majesty if need so       require, to play this winter time within the city at the       Cross Keys in Gracious Street, these are to require and pray       your Lordship (the time being such as, thanks to God, there       is now no danger of the sickness) to permit and suffer them       so to do.[19]    [Footnote 19: _The Remembrancia_, The Malone Society's _Collections_,  I, 73.]    By such devices as this the players were usually able to secure  permission to act \"within the city\" during the disagreeable months of  the winter when the large playhouses in the suburbs were difficult of  access.    1594. Anthony Bacon, the elder brother of Francis, came to lodge in  Bishopsgate Street. This fact very much disturbed his good mother, who  feared lest his servants might be corrupted by the plays to be seen at  the Bull near by.[20]    [Footnote 20: See W. Rendle, _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 236.]    1596. William Lambarde, in his _Perambulation of Kent_,[21] observes  that none of those who go \"to Paris Garden, the Bell Savage, or  Theatre, to behold bear-baiting, interludes, or fence play, can  account of any pleasant spectacle unless they first pay one penny at  the gate, another at the entry of the scaffold, and the third for a  quiet standing.\"    [Footnote 21: The passage does not appear in the earlier edition of  1576, though it was probably written shortly after the erection of the  Theatre in the autumn of 1576.]    1602. On March 31 the Privy Council wrote to the Lord Mayor that the  players of the Earl of Oxford and of the Earl of Worcester had been  \"joined by agreement together in one company, to whom, upon notice of  Her Majesty's pleasure, at the suit of the Earl of Oxford, toleration  hath been thought meet to be granted.\" The letter concludes:         And as the other companies that are allowed, namely of me       the Lord Admiral, and the Lord Chamberlain, be appointed       their certain houses, and one and no more to each company,       so we do straightly require that this third company be       likewise [appointed] to one place. And because we are       informed the house called the Boar's Head is the place they       have especially used and do best like of, we do pray and       require you that the said house, namely the Boar's Head, may       be assigned unto them.[22]    [Footnote 22: _The Remembrancia_, The Malone Society's _Collections_,  I, 85.]    That the strong Oxford-Worcester combination should prefer the Boar's  Head to the Curtain or the Rose Playhouse,[23] indicates that the  inn-yard was not only large, but also well-equipped for acting.    [Footnote 23: They had to use the Rose nevertheless; see page 158.]    1604. In a draft of a license to be issued to Queen Anne's Company,  those players are allowed to act \"as well within their now usual  houses, called the Curtain and the Boar's Head, within our County of  Middlesex, as in any other playhouse not used by others.\"[24]    [Footnote 24: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 265.]    In 1608 the Boar's Head seems to have been occupied by the newly  organized Prince Charles's Company. In William Kelly's extracts from  the payments of the city of Leicester we find the entry: \"Itm. Given  to the Prince's Players, of Whitechapel, London, xx _s._\"    In 1664, as Flecknoe tells us, the Cross Keys and the Bull still gave  evidence of their former use as playhouses; perhaps even then they  were occasionally let for fencing and other contests. In 1666 the  great fire completely destroyed the Bell, the Cross Keys, and the Bell  Savage; the Bull, however, escaped, and enjoyed a prosperous career  for many years after. Samuel Pepys was numbered among its patrons, and  writers of the Restoration make frequent reference to it. What became  of the Boar's Head without Aldgate I am unable to learn; its memory,  however, is perpetuated to-day in Boar's Head Yard, between Middlesex  Street and Goulston Street, Whitechapel.          CHAPTER II    THE HOSTILITY OF THE CITY      As the actors rapidly increased in number and importance, and as  Londoners flocked in ever larger crowds to witness plays, the  animosity of two forces was aroused, Puritanism and Civic  Government,--forces which opposed the drama for different reasons, but  with almost equal fervor. And when in the course of time the Governors  of the city themselves became Puritans, the combined animosity thus  produced was sufficient to drive the players out of London into the  suburbs.    The Puritans attacked the drama as contrary to Holy Writ, as  destructive of religion, and as a menace to public morality. Against  plays, players, and playgoers they waged in pulpit and pamphlet a  warfare characterized by the most intense fanaticism. The charges they  made--of ungodliness, idolatrousness, lewdness, profanity, evil  practices, enormities, and \"abuses\" of all kinds--are far too numerous  to be noted here; they are interesting chiefly for their  unreasonableness and for the violence with which they were urged.    And, after all, however much the Puritans might rage, they were  helpless; authority to restrain acting was vested in the Lord Mayor,  his brethren the Aldermen, and the Common Council. The attitude of  these city officials towards the drama was unmistakable: they had no  more love for the actors than had the Puritans. They found that \"plays  and players\" gave them more trouble than anything else in the entire  administration of municipal affairs. The dedication of certain \"great  inns\" to the use of actors and to the entertainment of the  pleasure-loving element of the city created new and serious problems  for those charged with the preservation of civic law and order. The  presence in these inns of private rooms adjoining the yard and  balconies gave opportunity for immorality, gambling, fleecing, and  various other \"evil practices\"--an opportunity which, if we may  believe the Common Council, was not wasted. Moreover, the proprietors  of these inns made a large share of their profits from the beer, ale,  and other drinks dispensed to the crowds before, during, and after  performances (the proprietor of the Cross Keys, it will be recalled,  was described as \"citizen and brewer of London\"); and the resultant  intemperance among \"such as frequented the said plays, being the  ordinary place of meeting for all vagrant persons, and masterless men  that hang about the city, theeves, horse-stealers, whoremongers,  cozeners, cony-catching persons, practicers of treason, and such other  like,\"[25] led to drunkenness, frays, bloodshed, and often to general  disorder. Sometimes, as we know, turbulent apprentices and other  factions met by appointment at plays for the sole purpose of starting  riots or breaking open jails. \"Upon Whitsunday,\" writes the Recorder  to Lord Burghley, \"by reason no plays were the same day, all the city  was quiet.\"[26]    [Footnote 25: So the Lord Mayor characterized playgoers; see _The  Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 75.]    [Footnote 26: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 164.]    Trouble of an entirely different kind arose when in the hot months of  the summer the plague was threatening. The meeting together at plays  of \"great multitudes of the basest sort of people\" served to spread  the infection throughout the city more quickly and effectively than  could anything else. On such occasions it was exceedingly difficult  for the municipal authorities to control the actors, who were at best  a stubborn and unruly lot; and often the pestilence had secured a full  start before acting could be suppressed.    These troubles, and others which cannot here be mentioned, made one of  the Lord Mayors exclaim in despair: \"The Politique State and  Government of this City by no one thing is so greatly annoyed and  disquieted as by players and plays, and the disorders which follow  thereupon.\"[27]    [Footnote 27: _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's  _Collections_, I, 69.]    This annoyance, serious enough in itself, was aggravated by the fact  that most of the troupes were under the patronage of great noblemen,  and some were even high in favor with the Queen. As a result, the  attempts on the part of the Lord Mayor and his Aldermen to regulate  the players were often interfered with by other or higher authority.  Sometimes it was a particular nobleman, whose request was not to be  ignored, who intervened in behalf of his troupe; most often, however,  it was the Privy Council, representing the Queen and the nobility in  general, which championed the cause of the actors and countermanded  the decrees of the Lord Mayor and his brethren. One of the most  notable things in the City's _Remembrancia_ is this long conflict of  authority between the Common Council and the "]]]
