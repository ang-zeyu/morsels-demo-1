He was murdered by one of his  officers, Allectus, who called himself emperor in turn and continued to  rule in Britain for three years. Then the end came for him as well. The  Roman general landing with a large force marched upon London where  Allectus lay. A battle fought in the south of London resulted in the  overthrow and death of the usurper. His soldiers taking advantage of the  confusion began to plunder and murder in the town, but were stopped and  killed by the victors.    Constantine, who became emperor in 306, was then in Britain, but his  name is not connected with London except by coins bearing his name.    Tradition connects the name of Helena, Constantine's mother, with  London, but there is nothing to prove that she was ever in the island at  all.    Late in the fourth century troubles began to fall thick upon the  country. The Picts and the Scots overran the northern parts and  penetrated to the very walls of London. The general Theodosius, whose  son became the emperor of that name, drove them back. About this time  the wall of London was built; not the wall of the Roman fort, but that  of the whole City. From the year 369, when Theodosius the general landed  in Britain, to the year 609 we see nothing of London except one brief  glimpse of fugitives flying for their lives across London Bridge. Of  this interval we shall speak in the next chapter. Meanwhile it is  sufficient to say that the decay of the Roman power made it necessary to  withdraw the legions from the outlying and distant portions of the  Empire. Britain had to be abandoned. It was as if England were to give  up Hong Kong and Singapore and the West Indies because she could no  longer spare the ships and regiments to defend them. The nation which  abandons her possessions is not far from downfall. Remember, when you  listen to those who advocate abandonment of our colonies, the example of  Rome.          5. AFTER THE ROMANS.    PART I.      The Romans left London. That was early in the fifth century; probably in  the year 410.    Two hundred years later we find the East Saxons in London.    What happened during this long interval of seven generations? Not a word  reaches us of London for two hundred years except once when, after a  defeat of the British by the Saxons at Crayford in the year 457, we read  that the fugitives crossed over London Bridge to take refuge within the  walls of the City. What happened during this two hundred years?[1]    We know what happened with other cities. Anderida, now called Pevensey,  was taken by the Saxons, and all its inhabitants, man, woman and child,  were slaughtered, so that it became a waste until the Normans built a  castle within the old walls. Canterbury, Silchester, Porchester,  Colchester--all were taken, their people massacred, the walls left  standing, the streets left desolate. For the English--the Saxons--loved  not city walls. Therefore, we might reasonably conclude that the same  thing happened to London. But if it be worthy of the chronicler to note  the massacre of Anderida, a small seaport, why should he omit the far  more important capture of Augusta?    [1] On this subject, see the author's book _London_ (Chatto & Windus).    Let us hear what history has to tell. Times full of trouble fell upon  the country. Long before the Romans went away the Picts and Scots were  pouring their wild hordes over the north and west, sometimes getting as  far south as the Middlesex Forest, murdering and destroying. As early as  the year 368, forty years before they left the country, the Romans sent  an expedition north to drive back these savages. Already the Saxons, the  Jutes and the Angles were sending piratical expeditions to harry the  coast and even to make settlements. The arm of the Roman was growing  weak, it could not stretch out so far: the fleets of the Romans, under  the officer called the 'Count of the Saxon Shore'--whose duty was to  guard the eastern and southern coasts--were destroyed and their  commander slain. So that, with foes on the eastern seaboard, foes in the  Channel, foes in the river, foes in the north and west, it is certain  that the trade of Augusta was declining long before the City was left to  defend itself.    What sort of defence were the people likely to offer? For nearly four  hundred years they had lived at peace, free to grow rich and luxurious,  with mercenaries to fight for them. Between the taking of the City by  Boadicea and the departure of the Romans, a space of three hundred and  fifty years, the peace of the City was only disturbed by the lawlessness  of Allectus's mercenaries. Their attempt to sack the City was put down,  it is significant to note, not by the citizens but by the Roman soldiers  who entered the City in time. The citizens were mostly merchants: they  were Christians in name and in form of worship, they were superstitious,  they were luxurious, they were unwarlike. Many of them were not Britons  at all, but foreigners settled in the City for trade. Moreover, for it  is not true that the whole British people had grown unfit for war, a  revolt of the Roman legions in the year 407 drew a large number of the  young men into their ranks, and when Constantine the usurper took them  over into Gaul for the four years' fighting which followed, the country  was drained of its best fighting material. The City, then, contained a  large number of wealthy merchants, native and foreign; it also contained  a great many slaves who were occupied in the conduct of the trade, and  few, since the young men went away with Constantine, who could be relied  upon to fight.    One more point may be made out from history. Since London was a town  which then, as now, lived entirely by its trade and was the centre of  the export and import trade of the whole country, the merchants, as we  have seen, must have suffered most severely long before the Romans went  away. We are, therefore, in the year 410, facing a situation full of  menace. The Picts and Scots are overrunning the whole of the north, the  Saxons are harrying the east and the south-east, trade is dying, there  is little demand for imports, there are few exports, it is useless for  ships to wait cargoes which never arrive, it is useless for ships to  bring cargoes for which there is no demand.    [Illustration: REMAINS OF A VIKING SHIP, FROM A CAIRN AT GOKSTAD.    (_Now in the University at Christiania._)]    A declining city, a dying trade, enemies in all directions, an unwarlike  population. When the curtain falls upon the scene in the year 410 that  is what we see.          6. AFTER THE ROMANS.    PART II.      Consider, again, the position of London. It stood, as you have seen,  originally on two low hills overlooking the river. A strong wall built  all along the bank from Blackfriars (now so called) to the present site  of the Tower kept the river from swamping the houses and wharves which  sprang up behind this wall. The walls of the City later on, but only  about fifty years before the Romans went away, enclosed a large area  covered over with streets, narrow near the river and broad farther  north, and with residences, warehouses, villas, and workshops. There was  probably a population of 70,000 or even more. On the west, in the  direction of Westminster, the City wall overlooked an immense marsh: on  the south across the river there was a still broader and longer marsh:  on the east there was another great marsh with the sea overflowing the  sedgy meadows at every high tide: on the north there was a wild moor and  beyond the moor there was an immense forest. Four roads not counting the  river-way kept the City in communication with the rest of the island.  The most important of these roads was that afterwards called Watling  Street, which passed out at Newgate and led across the heart of the  country to Chester and Wales, to York and the north. The second,  afterwards called Ermyn Street, left the City at Bishopsgate and ran  through Lincoln to York, a third road called the Vicinal Way ran into  the eastern counties, and by way of London Bridge Watling Street was  connected with Dover.    London, therefore, standing in its marshes had no means of providing for  itself. All the food for its great population was imported. It was  brought on pack asses along these roads. It came from the farms and  gardens of the country inland by means of these high roads, strong,  broad, and splendid roads, as good as any we have since succeeded in  making. In peaceful times these roads were crowded all the way from  Chester and Lincoln and Dover with long trains of animals laden with  provisions for the people of London, as well as with goods for export  from the Port of London. They were met by long trains of animals laden  with imports being carried to their destination. The Thames in the same  way was filled with barges laden with provisions as well as with goods  going down the river to the people and the Port of London. Below Bridge  the river was filled with merchant ships bringing cargoes of wine and  spices and costly things to be exchanged for skins and slaves and  metals. Let us remember that the daily victualling of 70,000 people  means an immense service. We are so accustomed to find everything ready  to hand in cities containing millions as well as in villages of  hundreds, that we forget the magnitude of this service. No mind can  conceive the magnitude of the food supply of modern London, Paris, New  York, or even such towns as Portsmouth, Plymouth, Bristol. Yet try to  understand what it means to feed every day, without interruption, only a  small town of 70,000 people. So much bread for every day, so much meat,  so much fish, so much wine, beer, mead, or cider--because at no time did  people drink water if they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#4)"],[1," of  by the fact, that only two of his contemporaries are mentioned in the entire  volume, and that Muhammad's name occurs but five times, although he is all  the way through addressed by the Angel Gabriel as the recipient of the divine  revelations, with the word SAY. Perhaps such passages as Sura ii. 15, p. 339,  and v. 246, p. 365, and the constant mention of guidance, direction,  wandering, may have been suggested by reminiscences of his mercantile  journeys in his earlier years.    It may be considered quite certain that it was not customary to reduce to  writing any traditions concerning Muhammad himself for at least the greater  part of a century. They rested entirely on the memory of those who have  handed them down, and must necessarily have been coloured by their prejudices  and convictions, to say nothing of the tendency to the formation of myths and  to actual fabrication, which early shews itself, especially in  interpretations of the Koran, to subserve the purposes of the contending  factions of the Ommeyads and Abbâsides. It was under the 5th Caliph, Al-  Mâmûn, that three writers (mentioned below) on whom we mainly depend for all  really reliable information, flourished: and even their writings are  necessarily coloured by the theological tendencies of their master and  patron, who was a decided partizan of the divine right of Ali and of his  descendants. The incidents mentioned in the Koran itself, for the  interpretation of which early tradition is available, are comparatively few,  and there are many passages with which it is totally at variance; as, for  instance, that Muhammad worked miracles, which the Koran expressly disclaims.  Traditions can never be considered as at all reliable, unless they are  traceable to some common origin, have descended to us by independent  witnesses, and correspond with the statements of the Koran itself-always of  course deducting such texts as (which is not unfrequently the case) have  themselves given rise to the tradition. It soon becomes obvious to the reader  of Muslim traditions and commentators that both miracles and historical  events have been invented for the sake of expounding a dark and perplexing  text; and that even the earlier traditions are largely tinged with the  mythical element.    The first biographer of Muhammad of whom we have any information was Zohri,  who died A.H. 124, aged 72; but his works, though abundantly quoted by later  writers, are no longer extant. Much of his information was derived from Orwa,  who died A.H. 94, and was a near relative of Ayesha, the prophet's favourite  wife.    Ibn Ishaq, who died in A.H. 151, and who had been a hearer of Zohri, composed  a Biography of Muhammad for the use of the Caliph Al Mánsûr. On this work,  considerable remains of which have come down to us, Ibn Hisham, who died A.H.  213, based his Life of Muhammad.    Waquidi of Medina, who died A.H. 207, composed a biographical work, which has  reached us in an abbreviated form through his secretary (Katib). It is  composed entirely of traditions.    Tabari, \"the Livy of the Arabians\" (Gibbon, 51, n. 1), who died at Baghdad  A.H. 310, composed annals of Muhammad's life and of the progress of Islam.    These ancient writers are the principal sources whence anything like  authentic information as to the life of Muhammad has been derived. And it may  be safely concluded that after the diligent investigations carried on by the  professed collectors of traditions in the second century after the Hejira,  that little or nothing remains to be added to our stores of information  relative to the details of Muhammad's life, or to facts which may further  illustrate the text of the Koran. But however this may be, no records which  are posterior in date to these authorities can be considered as at all  deserving of dependance. \"To consider,\" says Dr. Sprenger, \"late historians  like Abulfeda as authorities, and to suppose that an account gains in  certainty because it is mentioned by several of them, is highly uncritical.\"  Life of Mohammad, p. 73.    The sources whence Muhammad derived the materials of his Koran are, over and  above the more poetical parts, which are his own creation, the legends of his  time and country, Jewish traditions based upon the Talmud, or perverted to  suit his own purposes, and the floating Christian traditions of Arabia and of  S. Syria. At a later period of his career no one would venture to doubt the  divine origin of the entire book. But at its commencement the case was  different. The people of Mecca spoke openly and tauntingly of it as the work  of a poet, as a collection of antiquated or fabulous legends, or as palpable  sorcery.4 They accused him of having confederates, and even specified  foreigners who had been his coadjutors. Such were Salman the Persian, to whom  he may have owed the descriptions of Heaven and Hell, which are analogous to  those of the Zendavesta; and the Christian monk Sergius, or as the  Muhammadans term him, Boheira. From the latter, and perhaps from other  Christians, especially slaves naturalised at Mecca, Muhammad obtained access  to the teaching of the Apocryphal Gospels, and to many popular traditions of  which those Gospels are the concrete expression. His wife Chadijah, as well  as her cousin Waraka, a reputed convert to Christianity, and Muhammad's  intimate friend, are said to have been well acquainted with the doctrines and  sacred books both of Jews and Christians. And not only were several Arab  tribes in the neighbourhood of Mecca converts to the Christian faith, but on  two occasions Muhammad had travelled with his uncle, Abu Talib, as far as  Bostra, where he must have had opportunities of learning the general outlines  of Oriental Christian doctrine, and perhaps of witnessing the ceremonial of  their worship. And it appears tolerably certain that previous to and at the  period of his entering into public life, there was a large number of  enquirers at Mecca, who like Zaid, Omayah of Taief, Waraka, etc., were  dissatisfied equally with the religion of their fathers, the Judaism and the  Christianity which they saw around them, and were anxiously enquiring for  some better way. The names and details of the lives of twelve of the  \"companions\" of Muhammad who lived in Mecca, Medina, and Taief, are recorded,  who previous to his assumption of the Prophetic office, called themselves  Hanyfs, i.e., converts, puritans, and were believers in one God, and regarded  Abraham as the founder of their religion. Muhammad publicly acknowledged that  he was a Hanyf-and this sect of the Hanyfites (who are in no way to be  confounded with the later sect of the same name) were among his Meccan  precursors. See n. pp. 209, 387. Their history is to be found in the Fihrist-  MS. Paris, anc. fonds, nr. 874 (and in other treatises)-which Dr. Sprenger  believes to have been in the library of the Caliph El-Mâmûn. In this  treatise, the Hanyfs are termed Sabeites, and said to have received the  Volumes (Sohof) or Books of Abraham, mentioned in Sura lxxxvii. 19, p. 40,  41, which most commentators affirm to have been borrowed from them, as is  also the case with the latter part of Sura liii. 37, ad f. p. 71; so that  from these \"Books\" Muhammad derived the legends of Ad and Themoud, whose  downfall, recent as it was (see note p. 300), he throws back to a period  previous to that of Moses, who is made to ask (Sura xiv. 9, p. 226) \"whether  their history had reached his hearers.\" Muhammad is said to have discovered  these \"Books\" to be a recent forgery, and that this is the reason why no  mention of them occurs after the fourth year of his Prophetic function, A.D.  616. Hence too, possibly, the title Hanyf was so soon dropped and exchanged  for that of Muslim, one who surrenders or resigns himself to God. The Waraka  above mentioned, and cousin of Chadijah, is said to have believed on Muhammad  as long as he continued true to the principles of the Hanyfs, but to have  quitted him in disgust at his subsequent proceedings, and to have died an  orthodox Christian.    It has been supposed that Muhammad derived many of his notions concerning  Christianity from Gnosticism, and that it is to the numerous gnostic sects  the Koran alludes when it reproaches the Christians with having \"split up  their religion into parties.\" But for Muhammad thus to have confounded  Gnosticism with Christianity itself, its prevalence in Arabia must have been  far more universal than we have any reason to believe it really was. In fact,  we have no historical authority for supposing that the doctrines of these  heretics were taught or professed in Arabia at all. It is certain, on the  other hand, that the Basilidans, Valentinians, and other gnostic sects had  either died out, or been reabsorbed into the orthodox Church, towards the  middle of the fifth century, and had disappeared from Egypt before the sixth.  It is nevertheless possible that the gnostic doctrine concerning the  Crucifixion was adopted by Muhammad as likely to reconcile the Jews to Islam,  as a religion embracing both Judaism and Christianity, if they might believe  that Jesus had not been put to death, and thus find the stumbling-block of  the atonement removed out of their path. The Jews would in this case have  simply been called upon to believe in Jesus as being what the Koran  represents him, a holy teacher, who, like the patriarch Enoch or the prophet  Elijah, had been miraculously taken from the earth. But, in all other  respects, the sober and matter-of-fact statements of the Koran relative to  the family and history of Jesus, are altogether opposed to the wild and  fantastic doctrines of Gnostic emanations, and especially to the manner in  which they supposed Jesus, at his Baptism, to have been brought into union  with a higher nature. It is quite clear that Muhammad borrowed in several  points from the doctrines of the Ebionites, Essenes, and Sabeites."]]]
