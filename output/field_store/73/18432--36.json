Some zealots might indeed be found who could not bear  the thought of imposing conditions on their King, and who were ready  to recall him without the smallest assurance that the Declaration of  Indulgence should not be instantly republished, that the High Commission  should not be instantly revived, that Petre should not be again seated  at the Council Board, and that the fellows of Magdalene should not again  be ejected. But the number of these men was small. On the other hand,  the number of those Royalists, who, if James would have acknowledged  his mistakes and promised to observe the laws, were ready to rally  round him, was very large. It is a remarkable fact that two able and  experienced statesmen, who had borne a chief part in the Revolution,  frankly acknowledged, a few days after the Revolution had been  accomplished, their apprehension that a Restoration was close at hand.  \"If King James were a Protestant,\" said Halifax to Reresby, \"we could  not keep him out four months.\" \"If King James,\" said Danby to the  same person about the same time, \"would but give the country some  satisfaction about religion, which he might easily do, it would be very  hard to make head against him.\" [9] Happily for England, James was, as  usual, his own worst enemy. No word indicating that he took blame  to himself on account of the past, or that he intended to govern  constitutionally for the future, could be extracted from him. Every  letter, every rumour, that found its way from Saint Germains to England  made men of sense fear that, if, in his present temper, he should be  restored to power, the second tyranny would be worse than the first.  Thus the Tories, as a body, were forced to admit, very unwillingly,  that there was, at that moment, no choice but between William and public  ruin. They therefore, without altogether relinquishing the hope that he  who was King by right might at some future time be disposed to listen to  reason, and without feeling any thing like loyalty towards him who was  King in possession, discontentedly endured the new government.    It may be doubted whether that government was not, during the first  months of its existence, in more danger from the affection of the Whigs  than from the disaffection of the Tories. Enmity can hardly be more  annoying than querulous, jealous, exacting fondness; and such was the  fondness which the Whigs felt for the Sovereign of their choice. They  were loud in his praise. They were ready to support him with purse and  sword against foreign and domestic foes. But their attachment to him was  of a peculiar kind. Loyalty such as had animated the gallant gentlemen  who fought for Charles the First, loyalty such as had rescued Charles  the Second from the fearful dangers and difficulties caused by twenty  years of maladministration, was not a sentiment to which the doctrines  of Milton and Sidney were favourable; nor was it a sentiment which a  prince, just raised to power by a rebellion, could hope to inspire. The  Whig theory of government is that kings exist for the people, and not  the people for the kings; that the right of a king is divine in no  other sense than that in which the right of a member of parliament, of  a judge, of a juryman, of a mayor, of a headborough, is divine; that,  while the chief magistrate governs according to law, he ought to be  obeyed and reverenced; that, when he violates the law, he ought to be  withstood; and that, when he violates the law grossly, systematically  and pertinaciously, he ought to be deposed. On the truth of these  principles depended the justice of William's title to the throne. It is  obvious that the relation between subjects who held these principles,  and a ruler whose accession had been the triumph of these principles,  must have been altogether different from the relation which had  subsisted between the Stuarts and the Cavaliers. The Whigs loved William  indeed: but they loved him not as a King, but as a party leader; and it  was not difficult to foresee that their enthusiasm would cool fast if he  should refuse to be the mere leader of their party, and should attempt  to be King of the whole nation. What they expected from him in return  for their devotion to his cause was that he should be one of themselves,  a stanch and ardent Whig; that he should show favour to none but Whigs;  that he should make all the old grudges of the Whigs his own; and there  was but too much reason to apprehend that, if he disappointed this  expectation, the only section of the community which was zealous in his  cause would be estranged from him. [10]    Such were the difficulties by which, at the moment of his elevation, he  found himself beset. Where there was a good path he had seldom failed to  choose it. But now he had only a choice among paths every one of which  seemed likely to lead to destruction. From one faction he could hope for  no cordial support. The cordial support of the other faction he could  retain only by becoming himself the most factious man in his kingdom, a  Shaftesbury on the throne. If he persecuted the Tories, their sulkiness  would infallibly be turned into fury. If he showed favour to the Tories,  it was by no means certain that he would gain their goodwill; and it was  but too probable that he might lose his hold on the hearts of the Whigs.  Something however he must do: something he must risk: a Privy Council  must be sworn in: all the great offices, political and judicial, must be  filled. It was impossible to make an arrangement that would please every  body, and difficult to make an arrangement that would please any body;  but an arrangement must be made.    What is now called a ministry he did not think of forming. Indeed what  is now called a ministry was never known in England till he had been  some years on the throne. Under the Plantagenets, the Tudors, and the  Stuarts, there had been ministers; but there had been no ministry. The  servants of the Crown were not, as now, bound in frankpledge for  each other. They were not expected to be of the same opinion even on  questions of the gravest importance. Often they were politically and  personally hostile to each other, and made no secret of their hostility.  It was not yet felt to be inconvenient or unseemly that they should  accuse each other of high crimes, and demand each other's heads. No man  had been more active in the impeachment of the Lord Chancellor Clarendon  than Coventry, who was a Commissioner of the Treasury. No man had  been more active in the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer Danby  than Winnington, who was Solicitor General. Among the members of the  Government there was only one point of union, their common head,  the Sovereign. The nation considered him as the proper chief of the  administration, and blamed him severely if he delegated his high  functions to any subject. Clarendon has told us that nothing was so  hateful to the Englishmen of his time as a Prime Minister. They would  rather, he said, be subject to an usurper like Oliver, who was first  magistrate in fact as well as in name, than to a legitimate King who  referred them to a Grand Vizier. One of the chief accusations which the  country party had brought against Charles the Second was that he was  too indolent and too fond of pleasure to examine with care the balance  sheets of public accountants and the inventories of military stores.  James, when he came to the crown, had determined to appoint no Lord  High Admiral or Board of Admiralty, and to keep the entire direction of  maritime affairs in his own hands; and this arrangement, which would now  be thought by men of all parties unconstitutional and pernicious in the  highest degree, was then generally applauded even by people who were not  inclined to see his conduct in a favourable light. How completely the  relation in which the King stood to his Parliament and to his ministers  had been altered by the Revolution was not at first understood even by  the most enlightened statesmen. It was universally supposed that  the government would, as in time past, be conducted by functionaries  independent of each other, and that William would exercise a general  superintendence over them all. It was also fully expected that a prince  of William's capacity and experience would transact much important  business without having recourse to any adviser.    There were therefore no complaints when it was understood that he had  reserved to himself the direction of foreign affairs. This was indeed  scarcely matter of choice: for, with the single exception of Sir William  Temple, whom nothing would induce to quit his retreat for public life,  there was no Englishman who had proved himself capable of conducting an  important negotiation with foreign powers to a successful and honourable  issue. Many years had elapsed since England had interfered with weight  and dignity in the affairs of the great commonwealth of nations.  The attention of the ablest English politicians had long been almost  exclusively occupied by disputes concerning the civil and ecclesiastical  constitution of their own country. The contests about the Popish Plot  and the Exclusion Bill, the Habeas Corpus Act and the Test Act, had  produced an abundance, it might almost be said a glut, of those talents  which raise men to eminence in societies torn by internal factions. All  the Continent could not show such skilful and wary leaders of parties,  such dexterous parliamentary tacticians, such ready and eloquent  debaters, as were assembled at Westminister. But a very different  training was necessary to form a great minister for foreign affairs; and  the Revolution had on a sudden placed England in a situation in which  the services of a great minister for foreign affairs were indispensable  to her.    William was admirably qualified to supply that in which the most  accomplished statesmen of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II â€” Volume 4 (#4)"],[1,"then can it be maintained that  he was at liberty to exercise the former power without consulting any  body, but that he was bound to exercise the latter power in conformity  with the advice of a minister? Will it be said that an error in  diplomacy is likely to be more injurious to the country than an error  in strategy? Surely not. It is hardly conceivable that any blunder which  William might have made at the Hague could have been more injurious to  the public interests than a defeat at the Boyne. Or will it be said that  there was greater reason for placing confidence in his military than in  his diplomatic skill? Surely not. In war he showed some great moral and  intellectual qualities; but, as a tactician, he did not rank high; and  of his many campaigns only two were decidedly successful. In the talents  of a negotiator, on the other hand, he has never been surpassed. Of the  interests and the tempers of the continental courts he knew more than  all his Privy Council together. Some of his ministers were doubtless men  of great ability, excellent orators in the House of Lords, and versed  in our insular politics. But, in the deliberations of the Congress,  Caermarthen and Nottingham would have been found as far inferior to him  as he would have been found inferior to them in a parliamentary debate  on a question purely English. The coalition against France was his work.  He alone had joined together the parts of that great whole; and he alone  could keep them together. If he had trusted that vast and complicated  machine in the hands of any of his subjects, it would instantly have  fallen to pieces.    Some things indeed were to be done which none of his subjects would have  ventured to do. Pope Alexander was really, though not in name, one of  the allies; it was of the highest importance to have him for a friend;  and yet such was the temper of the English nation that an English  minister might well shrink from having any dealings, direct or indirect,  with the Vatican. The Secretaries of State were glad to leave a matter  so delicate and so full of risk to their master, and to be able  to protest with truth that not a line to which the most intolerant  Protestant could object had ever gone out of their offices.    It must not be supposed however that William ever forgot that his  especial, his hereditary, mission was to protect the Reformed Faith.  His influence with Roman Catholic princes was constantly and strenuously  exerted for the benefit of their Protestant subjects. In the spring of  1691, the Waldensian shepherds, long and cruelly persecuted, and weary  of their lives, were surprised by glad tidings. Those who had been in  prison for heresy returned to their homes. Children, who had been  taken from their parents to be educated by priests, were sent back.  Congregations, which had hitherto met only by stealth and with extreme  peril, now worshipped God without molestation in the face of day. Those  simple mountaineers probably never knew that their fate had been a  subject of discussion at the Hague, and that they owed the happiness  of their firesides, and the security of their humble temples to the  ascendency which William exercised over the Duke of Savoy. [8]    No coalition of which history has preserved the memory has had an abler  chief than William. But even William often contended in vain against  those vices which are inherent in the nature of all coalitions. No  undertaking which requires the hearty and long continued cooperation  of many independent states is likely to prosper. Jealousies inevitably  spring up. Disputes engender disputes. Every confederate is tempted to  throw on others some part of the burden which he ought himself to bear.  Scarcely one honestly furnishes the promised contingent. Scarcely one  exactly observes the appointed day. But perhaps no coalition that ever  existed was in such constant danger of dissolution as the coalition  which William had with infinite difficulty formed. The long list of  potentates, who met in person or by their representatives at the Hague,  looked well in the Gazettes. The crowd of princely equipages, attended  by manycoloured guards and lacqueys, looked well among the lime trees  of the Voorhout. But the very circumstances which made the Congress  more splendid than other congresses made the league weaker than other  leagues. The more numerous the allies, the more numerous were the  dangers which threatened the alliance. It was impossible that twenty  governments, divided by quarrels about precedence, quarrels about  territory, quarrels about trade, quarrels about religion, could long  act together in perfect harmony. That they acted together during several  years in imperfect harmony is to be ascribed to the wisdom, patience and  firmness of William.    The situation of his great enemy was very different. The resources of  the French monarchy, though certainly not equal to those of England,  Holland, the House of Austria, and the Empire of Germany united, were  yet very formidable; they were all collected in a central position; they  were all under the absolute direction of a single mind. Lewis could do  with two words what William could hardly bring about by two months of  negotiation at Berlin, Munich, Brussels, Turin and Vienna. Thus France  was found equal in effective strength to all the states which were  combined against her. For in the political, as in the natural world,  there may be an equality of momentum between unequal bodies, when the  body which is inferior in weight is superior in velocity.    This was soon signally proved. In March the princes and ambassadors  who had been assembled at the Hague separated and scarcely had they  separated when all their plans were disconcerted by a bold and skilful  move of the enemy.    Lewis was sensible that the meeting of the Congress was likely to  produce a great effect on the public mind of Europe. That effect he  determined to counteract by striking a sudden and terrible blow. While  his enemies were settling how many troops each of them should furnish,  he ordered numerous divisions of his army to march from widely distant  points towards Mons, one of the most important, if not the most  important, of the fortresses which protected the Spanish Netherlands.  His purpose was discovered only when it was all but accomplished.  William, who had retired for a few days to Loo, learned, with surprise  and extreme vexation, that cavalry, infantry, artillery, bridges of  boats, were fast approaching the fated city by many converging routes.  A hundred thousand men had been brought together. All the implements  of war had been largely provided by Louvois, the first of living  administrators. The command was entrusted to Luxemburg, the first of  living generals. The scientific operations were directed by Vauban, the  first of living engineers. That nothing might be wanting which could  kindle emulation through all the ranks of a gallant and loyal army, the  magnificent King himself had set out from Versailles for the camp. Yet  William had still some faint hope that it might be possible to raise the  siege. He flew to the Hague, put all the forces of the States General in  motion, and sent pressing messages to the German Princes. Within three  weeks after he had received the first hint of the danger, he was in the  neighbourhood of the besieged city, at the head of near fifty thousand  troops of different nations. To attack a superior force commanded by  such a captain as Luxemburg was a bold, almost a desperate, enterprise.  Yet William was so sensible that the loss of Mons would be an almost  irreparable disaster and disgrace that he made up his mind to run the  hazard. He was convinced that the event of the siege would determine  the policy of the Courts of Stockholm and Copenhagen. Those Courts had  lately seemed inclined to join the coalition. If Mons fell, they would  certainly remain neutral; they might possibly become hostile. \"The  risk,\" he wrote to Heinsius, \"is great; yet I am not without hope. I  will do what can be done. The issue is in the hands of God.\" On the  very day on which this letter was written Mons fell. The siege had been  vigorously pressed. Lewis himself, though suffering from the gout, had  set the example of strenuous exertion. His household troops, the finest  body of soldiers in Europe, had, under his eye, surpassed themselves.  The young nobles of his court had tried to attract his notice by  exposing themselves to the hottest fire with the same gay alacrity with  which they were wont to exhibit their graceful figures at his balls. His  wounded soldiers were charmed by the benignant courtesy with which he  walked among their pallets, assisted while wounds were dressed by the  hospital surgeons, and breakfasted on a porringer of the hospital broth.  While all was obedience and enthusiasm among the besiegers, all was  disunion and dismay among the besieged. The duty of the French lines was  so well performed that no messenger sent by William was able to cross  them. The garrison did not know that relief was close at hand. The  burghers were appalled by the prospect of those horrible calamities  which befall cities taken by storm. Showers of shells and redhot bullets  were falling in the streets. The town was on fire in ten places at once.  The peaceful inhabitants derived an unwonted courage from the excess  of their fear, and rose on the soldiers. Thenceforth resistance was  impossible; and a capitulation was concluded. The armies then retired  into quarters. Military operations were suspended during some weeks;  Lewis returned in triumph to Versailles; and William paid a short visit  to England, where his presence was much needed. [9]    He found the ministers still employed in tracing out the ramifications  of the plot which had been discovered just before his departure. Early  in January, Preston, Ashton and Elliot had been arraigned at the "]]]
