And by vigorous thrusting,  with her triangular head as a wedge, she was able to widen the  aperture, inch by inch. In less than three minutes she had broadened it  far enough for her to wriggle out of the car and leap to the side of  the track. There she stood bewildered.    A spring snow was drifting down from the sulky sky. The air was damp  and penetrating. By reason of the new snow the scent of Hazen's  departing footsteps was blotted out. Hazen himself was no longer in  sight. As Lass had made the journey from house to tracks with her head  tucked confidingly under her kidnaper's arm, she had not noted the  direction. She was lost.    A little way down the track the station lights were shining with misty  warmth through the snow. Toward these lights the puppy trotted.    Under the station eaves, and waiting to be taken aboard the almost-due  eleven-forty express, several crates and parcels were grouped. One  crate was the scene of much the same sort of escape-drama that Lass had  just enacted.    The crate was big and comfortable, bedded down with soft sacking and  with \"insets\" at either side containing food and water. But commodious  as was the box, the unwonted confinement did not at all please its  occupant--a temperamental and highly bred young collie in process of  shipment from the Rothsay Kennels to a purchaser forty miles up the  line.    This collie, wearying of the delay and the loneliness and the strange  quarters, had begun to plunge from one side of the crate to the other  in an effort to break out. A carelessly nailed slat gave away under the  impact. The dog scrambled through the gap and proceeded to gallop  homeward through the snow.    Ten seconds later, Lass, drawn by the lights and by the scent of the  other dog, came to the crate. She looked in. There, made to order for  her, was a nice bed. There, too, were food and drink to appease the  ever-present appetite of a puppy. Lass writhed her way in through the  gap as easily as the former occupant had crawled out.    After doing due justice to the broken puppy biscuits in the  inset-trough, she curled herself up for a nap.    The clangor and glare of the oncoming express awakened her. She cowered  in one corner of the crate. Just then two station-hands began to move  the express packages out to the edge of the platform. One of them  noticed the displaced board of the crate. He drove home its loosened  nails with two sharp taps from a monkey-wrench, glanced inside to make  certain the dog had not gotten out, and presently hoisted the crate  aboard the express-car.    Two hours later the crate was unloaded at a waystation. At seven in the  morning an expressman drove two miles with it to a country-home, a mile  or so from the village where Lass had been disembarked from the train.    An eager knot of people--the Mistress, the Master and two  gardeners--crowded expectantly around the crate as it was set down on  the lawn in front of The Place's veranda. The latch was unfastened, and  the crate's top was lifted back on its hinges.    Out stepped Lass,--tired, confused, a little frightened, but eagerly  willing to make friends with a world which she still insisted on  believing was friendly. It is hard to shake a collie pup's inborn faith  in the friendliness of mankind, but once shaken, it is more than  shaken. It is shattered beyond hope of complete mending.    For an instant she stood thus, looking in timid appeal from one to  another of the faces about her. These faces were blank enough as they  returned her gaze. The glad expectancy was wiped from them as with a  sponge. It was the Master who first found voice.    \"And THAT'S Rothsay Princess!\" he snorted indignantly. \"That's the pup  worth two hundred dollars at eight months, 'because she has every  single good point of Champion Rothsay Chief and not a flaw from nostril  to tail-tip'! Rothsay wrote those very words about her, you remember.  And he's supposed to be the most dependable man in the collie business!  Lord! She's undersized--no bigger than a five monther! And she's  prick-eared and apple-domed; and her head's as wide as a church door!\"    Apparently these humans were not glad to see her. Lass was grieved at  their cold appraisal and a little frightened by the Master's tone of  disgust. Yet she was eager, as ever, to make a good impression and to  lure people into liking her. Shyly she walked up to the Mistress and  laid one white little paw on her knee.    Handshaking was Lass's one accomplishment. It had been taught her by  Dick. It had pleased the boy. He had been proud of her ability to do  it. Perhaps it might also please these strangers. And after the odd  fashion of all new arrivals who came to The Place, Lass picked out the  Mistress, rather than any one else, as a potential friend.    The Mistress had ever roused the impatience of collie experts by  looking past the showier \"points\" of a dog and into the soul and brain  and disposition that lay behind them. So now she looked; and what she  saw in Lass's darkly wistful eyes established the intruder's status at  The Place.    \"Let her stay!\" pleaded the Mistress as the Master growled something  about bundling the dog into her crate again and sending her back to the  Rothsay Kennels. \"Let her stay, please! She's a dear.\"    \"But we're not breeding 'dears,'\" observed the Master. \"We planned to  breed a strain of perfect collies. And this is a mutt!\"    \"Her pedigree says there's no better collie blood in America,\" denied  the Mistress. \"And even if she happens to be a 'second,' that's no sign  her puppies will be seconds. See how pretty and loving and wise she is.  DO keep her!\"    Which of course settled the matter.    Up the lawn, from his morning swim in the lake, strolled a great  mahogany-and-white collie. At sight of Lass he lowered his head for a  charge. He was king of The Place's dogs, this mighty thoroughbred,  Sunnybank Lad. And he did not welcome canine intruders.    But he halted midway in his dash toward the puppy who frisked forth so  gayly to meet him. For he recognized her as a female. And man is the  only animal that will molest the female of his species.    The fiercely silent charge was changed in a trice to a coldly civil  touching of noses, and the majestic wagging of a plumy tail. After  which, side by side, the two collies--big and little--old and  new--walked up to the veranda, to be petted by the humans who had so  amusedly watched their encounter.    \"See!\" exclaimed the Mistress, in triumph. \"Lad has accepted her. He  vouches for her. That ought to be enough for any one!\"    Thus it was that Lass found a home.    As she never yet had been taught to know her name, she learned readily  to respond to the title of \"Princess.\" And for several months life went  on evenly and happily for her.    Indeed, life was always wondrous pleasant, there at The Place,--for  humans and for animals alike. A fire-blue lake bordered the grounds on  two sides. Behind stretched the forest. And on every side arose the  soft green mountains, hemming in and brooding over The Place as though  they loved it. In the winter evenings there was the huge library hearth  with its blaze and warmth; and a disreputable fur rug in front of it  that might have been ordained expressly for tired dogs to drowse on.  And there were the Mistress and the Master. Especially the Mistress!  The Mistress somehow had a way of making all the world seem worth while.    Then, of a morning, when Lass was just eleven months old, two things  happened.    The Mistress and the Master went down to her kennel after breakfast.  Lass did not run forth to greet them as usual. She lay still, wagging  her tail in feeble welcome as they drew near. But she did not get up.    Crowding close to her tawny side was a tiny, shapeless creature that  looked more like a fat blind rat than like anything else. It was a  ten-hour-old collie pup--a male, and yellowish brown of hue.    \"That's the climax!\" complained the Master, breaking in on the  Mistress's rhapsodies. \"Here we've been planning to start a kennel of  home-bred collies! And see what results we get! One solitary puppy! Not  once in ten times are there less than six in a collie-litter. Sometimes  there are a dozen. And here the dog you wheedled me into keeping has  just one! I expected at least seven.\"    \"If it's a freak to be the only puppy in a litter,\" answered the  Mistress, refusing to part with her enthusiasm over the miracle, \"then  this one ought to bring us luck. Let's call him 'Bruce.' You remember,  the original Bruce won because of the mystic number, seven. This Bruce  has got to make up to us for the seven puppies that weren't born. See  how proud she is of him! Isn't she a sweet little mother?\"    The second of the morning's events was a visit from the foreman of the  Rothsay Kennels, who motored across to The Place, intent on clearing up  a mystery.    \"The Boss found a collie yesterday, tied in the front yard of a negro  cabin a mile or two from our kennels,\" he told the Master. \"He  recognized her right away as Rothsay Princess. The negro claims to have  found her wandering around near the railroad tracks, one night, six  months ago. Now, what's the answer?\"    \"The answer,\" said the Master, \"is that your boss is mistaken. I've had  Rothsay Princess for the past six months. And she's the last dog I'll  ever get from the Rothsay Kennels. I was stung, good and plenty, on  that deal.    \"My wife wanted to keep her, or I'd have made a kick in the courts for  having to pay two hundred dollars for a cheeky, apple-domed, prick  eared--\"    \"Prick-eared!\" exclaimed the foreman, aghast at the volleyed sacrilege.  \"Rothsay Princess has the best ears of any pup we've bred since  Champion Rothsay Chief. Not a flaw in that pup. She--\"    \"Not a flaw, hey!\" sniffed the Master. \"Come down to the kennel and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#4)"],[1," up his bag and running at top speed, he himself could  easily win clear of the Place before anyone of the household should  appear. And his car would be a mile away before the neighborhood could  be aroused. Fury at the weird beast and the wrenching strain on his own  nerves lent eagerness to his acceptance of the idea.    He reached back again for his pistol, whipped it out, and, coming to a  standstill, aimed at the pup. Lad, waiting only to bound over an  obstruction in his path, came to a corresponding pause, not ten feet  ahead of his playmate.    It was an easy shot. Yet the bullet went several inches above the  obligingly waiting dog's back. Nine men out of ten, shooting by  moonlight or by flashlight, aim too high. The thief had heard this old  marksman-maxim fifty times. But, like most hearers of maxims, he had  forgotten it at the one time in his speckled career when it might have  been of any use to him.    He had fired. He had missed. In another second, every sleeper in the  house and in the gate-lodge would be out of bed. His night's work was a  blank, unless--    With a bull rush he hurled himself forward at the interestedly waiting  Lad. And, as he sprang, he fired again. Then several things happened.    Everyone, except movie actors and newly-appointed policemen, knows that  a man on foot cannot shoot straight, unless he is standing stock still.  Yet, as luck would have it, this second shot found a mark where the  first and better aimed bullet had gone wild.    Lad had leaped the narrow and deep ditch left along the lawn-edge by  workers who were putting in a new water-main for the Place. On the far  side of this obstacle he had stopped, and had waited for his friend to  follow. But the friend had not followed. Instead, he had been somehow  responsible for a spurt of red flame and for a most thrilling racket.  Lad was more impressed than ever by the man's wondrous possibilities as  a midnight entertainer. He waited, gayly expectant, for more. He got it.    There was a second rackety explosion and a second puff of lightning  from the man's out-flung hand. But, this time, something like a red-hot  whip-lash smote Lad with horribly agonizing force athwart the right hip.    The man had done this,--the man whom Laddie had thought so friendly and  playful!    He had not done it by accident. For his hand had been out-flung  directly at the pup, just as once had been the arm of the kennelman,  back at Lad's birthplace, in beating a disobedient mongrel. It was the  only beating Lad had ever seen. And it had stuck, shudderingly, in his  uncannily sensitive memory. Yet now, he himself had just had a like  experience.    In an instant, the pup's trustful friendliness was gone. The man had  come on the Place, at dead of night, and had struck him. That must be  paid for! Never would the pup forget,--his agonizing lesson that night  intruders are not to be trusted or even to be tolerated. Within a  single second, he had graduated from a little friend of all the world,  into a vigilant watchdog.    With a snarl, he dropped the bag and whizzed forward at his assailant.  Needle-sharp milk-teeth bared, head low, ruff abristle, friendly soft  eyes as ferocious as a wolf's, he charged.    There had been scarce a breathing-space between the second report of  the pistol and the collie's counterattack. But there had been time  enough for the onward-plunging thief to step into the narrow lip of the  water-pipe ditch. The momentum of his own rush hurled the upper part of  his body forward. But his left leg, caught between the ditch-sides, did  not keep pace with the rest of him. There was a hideous snapping sound,  a screech of mortal anguish; and the man crashed to earth, in a dead  faint of pain and shock,--his broken left leg still thrust at an  impossible angle in the ditch.    Lad checked himself midway in his own fierce charge. Teeth bare, throat  agrowl, he hesitated. It had seemed to him right and natural to assail  the man who had struck him so painfully. But now this same man was  lying still and helpless under him. And the sporting instincts of a  hundred generations of thoroughbreds cried out to him not to mangle the  defenseless.    Wherefore, he stood, irresolute; alert for sign of movement on the part  of his foe. But there was no such sign. And the light bullet-graze on  his hip was hurting like the very mischief.    Moreover, every window in the house beyond was blossoming forth into  lights. There were sounds,--reassuring human sounds. And doors were  opening. His deities were coming forth.    All at once, Laddie stopped being a vengeful beast of prey; and  remembered that he was a very small and very much hurt and very lonely  and worried puppy. He craved the Mistress's dear touch on his wound,  and a word of crooning comfort from her soft voice. This yearning was  mingled with a doubt lest perhaps he had been transgressing the Place's  Law, in some new way; and lest he might have let himself in for a  scolding. The Law was still so queer and so illogical!    Lad started toward the house. Then, pausing, he picked up the bag which  had been so exhilarating a plaything for him this past few minutes and  which he had forgotten in his pain.    It was Lad's collie way to pick up offerings (ranging from slippers to  very dead fish) and to carry them to the Mistress. Sometimes he was  petted for this. Sometimes the offering was lifted gingerly between  aloof fingers and tossed back into the lake. But, nobody could well  refuse so jingly and pretty a gift as this satchel.    The Master, sketchily attired, came running down the lawn, flashlight  in hand. Past him, unnoticed, as he sped toward the ditch, a collie pup  limped;--a very unhappy and comfort-seeking puppy who carried in his  mouth a blood-spattered brown bag.    \"It doesn't make sense to me!\" complained the Master, next day, as he  told the story for the dozenth time, to a new group of callers. \"I  heard the shots and I went out to investigate. There he was lying, half  in and half out of the ditch. The fellow was unconscious. He didn't get  his senses back till after the police came. Then he told some babbling  yarn about a creature that had stolen his bag of loot and that had  lured him to the ditch. He was all unnerved and upset, and almost out  of his head with pain. So the police had little enough trouble in  'sweating' him. He told everything he knew. And there's a wholesale  round-up of the motor-robbery bunch going on this afternoon as a result  of it. But what I can't understand--\"    \"It's as clear as day,\" insisted the Mistress, stroking a silken head  that pressed lovingly against her knee. \"As clear as day. I was  standing in the doorway here when Laddie came pattering up to me and  laid a little satchel at my feet. I opened it, and well, it had  everything of value in it that had been in the safe over there. That  and the thief's story make it perfectly plain. Laddie caught the man as  he was climbing out of that window. He got the bag away from him; and  the man chased him, firing as he went. And he stumbled into the ditch  and--\"    \"Nonsense!\" laughed the Master. \"I'll grant all you say about Lad's  being the most marvelous puppy on earth. And I'll even believe all the  miracles of his cleverness. But when it comes to taking a bag of  jewelry from a burglar and then enticing him to a ditch and then coming  back here to you with the bag--\"    \"Then how do you account--?\"    \"I don't. None of it makes sense to me. As I just said. But, whatever  happened, it's turned Laddie into a real watchdog. Did you notice how  he went for the police when they started down the drive, last night?  We've got a watchdog at last.\"    \"We've got more than a watchdog,\" amended the Mistress. \"An ordinary  watchdog would just scare away thieves or bite them. Lad captured the  thief and then brought the stolen jewelry back to us. No other dog  could have done that.\"    Lad, enraptured by the note of praise in the Mistress's soft voice,  looked adoringly up into the face that smiled so proudly down at him.  Then, catching the sound of a step on the drive, he dashed out to bark  in murderous fashion at a wholly harmless delivery boy whom he had seen  every day for weeks.    A watchdog can't afford to relax vigilance, for a single  instant,--especially at the responsible age of five months.        CHAPTER II. The Fetish    From the night of the robbery, Lad's high position at the Place was  assured.    Even in the months of ganglingly leggy awkwardness which generally  separate furry puppyhood from dignified collie maturity, he gave sure  promise of his quality. He was such a dog as is found perhaps once in a  generation; the super-collie that neither knows nor needs such things  as whip and chain; and that learns the Law with bewildering swiftness.  A dog with a brain and a mighty heart, as well as an endless fund of  loveableness and of gay courage.    Month by month, the youngster developed into a massive giant; his  orange-mahogany coat a miracle of thickness and length, his deep chest  promising power as well as wolflike grace. His mind and his oddly human  traits developed as fast as did his body.    After the first month or so he received privileges never to be accorded  to any other of the Place's dogs in Lad's lifetime. He slept at night  under the music-room piano, in the \"cave\" that was his delight. At  mealtimes he was even admitted into the sacred dining-room, where he  lay on the floor at the Master's left hand. He had the run of the  house, as fully as any human.    It was when Lad was eighteen months old that the mad-dog scare swept  Hampton village; and reached its crawly tentacles out across the lake  to the mile-distant Place.    Down the village street, one day, trotted an enormous black mongrel;  full in the center of the roadway. The mongrel's heavy head was low,  and lolled from side to side with each lurching stride of the big body.  "]]]
