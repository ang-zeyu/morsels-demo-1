He clasped his hands behind him and  looked at her affectionately.    \"I like the way you talk,\" he said. \"I never knew anybody did talk  like that except folks in books and my rock people.\"    \"Your rock people?\"    \"I'm eleven years old. I haven't any father or mother, they're dead. I  live over there with Stephen Kane. Stephen is splendid. He plays the  violin and takes me fishing in his boat. When I get bigger he's going  shares with me. I love him, and I love my rock people too.\"    \"What do you mean by your rock people?\" asked Miss Trevor, enjoying  herself hugely. This was the only child she had ever met who talked as  she wanted children to talk and who understood her remarks without  having to have them translated.    \"Nora is one of them,\" said Paul, \"the best one of them. I love her  better than all the others because she came first. She lives around  that point and she has black eyes and black hair and she knows all  about the mermaids and water kelpies. You ought to hear the stories  she can tell. Then there are the Twin Sailors. They don't live  anywhere--they sail all the time, but they often come ashore to talk  to me. They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in  the world--and more than what's in the world, if you only knew it. Do  you know what happened to the Youngest Twin Sailor once? He was  sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade. A moonglade is the track  the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea, you  know. Well, the Youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till  he came right up to the moon, and there was a little golden door in  the moon and he opened it and sailed right through. He had some  wonderful adventures inside the moon--I've got them all written down  in my foolscap book. Then there is the Golden Lady of the Cave. One  day I found a big cave down the shore and I went in and in and in--and  after a while I found the Golden Lady. She has golden hair right down  to her feet, and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold  that is alive. And she has a golden harp and she plays all day long on  it--you might hear the music if you'd listen carefully, but prob'bly  you'd think it was only the wind among the rocks. I've never told Nora  about the Golden Lady, because I think it would hurt her feelings. It  even hurts her feelings when I talk too long with the Twin Sailors.  And I hate to hurt Nora's feelings, because I do love her best of all  my rock people.\"    \"Paul! How much of this is true?\" gasped Miss Trevor.    \"Why, none of it!\" said Paul, opening his eyes widely and  reproachfully. \"I thought you would know that. If I'd s'posed you  wouldn't I'd have warned you there wasn't any of it true. I thought  you were one of the kind that would know.\"    \"I am. Oh, I am!\" said Miss Trevor eagerly. \"I really would have known  if I had stopped to think. Well, it's getting late now. I must go  back, although I don't want to. But I'm coming to see you again. Will  you be here tomorrow afternoon?\"    Paul nodded.    \"Yes. I promised to meet the Youngest Twin Sailor down at the striped  rocks tomorrow afternoon, but the day after will do just as well. That  is the beauty of the rock people, you know. You can always depend on  them to be there just when you want them. The Youngest Twin Sailor  won't mind--he's very good-tempered. If it was the Oldest Twin I dare  say he'd be cross. I have my suspicions about that Oldest Twin  sometimes. I b'lieve he'd be a pirate if he dared. You don't know how  fierce he can look at times. There's really something very mysterious  about him.\"    On her way back to the hotel Miss Trevor remembered the foolscap book.    \"I must get him to show it to me,\" she mused, smiling. \"Why, the boy  is a born genius--and to think he should be a shore boy! I can't  understand it. And here I am loving him already. Well, a woman has to  love something--and you don't have to know people for years before you  can love them.\"    Paul was waiting on the Noel's Cove rocks for Miss Trevor the next  afternoon. He was not alone; a tall man, with a lined, strong-featured  face and a grey beard, was with him. The man was clad in a rough suit  and looked what he was, a 'longshore fisherman. But he had deep-set,  kindly eyes, and Miss Trevor liked his face. He moved off to one side  when she came and stood there for a little, apparently gazing out to  sea, while Paul and Miss Trevor talked. Then he walked away up the  cove and disappeared in his little grey house.    \"Stephen came down to see if you were a suitable person for me to talk  to,\" said Paul gravely.    \"I hope he thinks I am,\" said Miss Trevor, amused.    \"Oh, he does! He wouldn't have gone away and left us alone if he  didn't. Stephen is very particular who he lets me 'sociate with. Why,  even the rock people now--I had to promise I'd never let the Twin  Sailors swear before he'd allow me to be friends with them. Sometimes  I know by the look of the Oldest Twin that he's just dying to swear,  but I never let him, because I promised Stephen. I'd do anything for  Stephen. He's awful good to me. Stephen's bringing me up, you know,  and he's bound to do it well. We're just perfectly happy here, only I  wish I'd more books to read. We go fishing, and when we come home at  night I help Stephen clean the fish and then we sit outside the door  and he plays the violin for me. We sit there for hours sometimes. We  never talk much--Stephen isn't much of a hand for talking--but we just  sit and think. There's not many men like Stephen, I can tell you.\"    Miss Trevor did not get a glimpse of the foolscap book that day, nor  for many days after. Paul blushed all over his beautiful face whenever  she mentioned it.    \"Oh, I couldn't show you that,\" he said uncomfortably. \"Why, I've  never even showed it to Stephen--or Nora. Let me tell you something  else instead, something that happened to me once long ago. You'll find  it more interesting than the foolscap book, only you must remember it  isn't true! You won't forget that, will you?\"    \"I'll try to remember,\" Miss Trevor agreed.    \"Well, I was sitting here one evening just like I was last night, and  the sun was setting. And an enchanted boat came sailing over the sea  and I got into her. The boat was all pearly like the inside of the  mussel shells, and her sail was like moonshine. Well, I sailed right  across to the sunset. Think of that--I've been in the sunset! And what  do you suppose it is? The sunset is a land all flowers, like a great  garden, and the clouds are beds of flowers. We sailed into a great big  harbour, a thousand times bigger than the harbour over there at your  hotel, and I stepped out of the boat on a 'normous meadow all roses. I  stayed there for ever so long. It seemed almost a year, but the  Youngest Twin Sailor says I was only away a few hours or so. You see,  in Sunset Land the time is ever so much longer than it is here. But I  was glad to come back too. I'm always glad to come back to the cove  and Stephen. Now, you know this never really happened.\"    Miss Trevor would not give up the foolscap book so easily, but for a  long time Paul refused to show it to her. She came to the cove every  day, and every day Paul seemed more delightful to her. He was so  quaint, so clever, so spontaneous. Yet there was nothing premature or  unnatural about him. He was wholly boy, fond of fun and frolic, not  too good for little spurts of quick temper now and again, though, as  he was careful to explain to Miss Trevor, he never showed them to a  lady.    \"I get real mad with the Twin Sailors sometimes, and even with  Stephen, for all he's so good to me. But I couldn't be mad with you or  Nora or the Golden Lady. It would never do.\"    Every day he had some new story to tell of a wonderful adventure on  rock or sea, always taking the precaution of assuring her beforehand  that it wasn't true. The boy's fancy was like a prism, separating  every ray that fell upon it into rainbows. He was passionately fond of  the shore and water. The only world for him beyond Noel's Cove was the  world of his imagination. He had no companions except Stephen and the  \"rock people.\"    \"And now you,\" he told Miss Trevor. \"I love you too, but I know you'll  be going away before long, so I don't let myself love you as  much--quite--as Stephen and the rock people.\"    \"But you could, couldn't you?\" pleaded Miss Trevor. \"If you and I were  to go on being together every day, you could love me just as well as  you love them, couldn't you?\"    Paul considered in a charming way he had.    \"Of course I could love you better than the Twin Sailors and the  Golden Lady,\" he announced finally. \"And I think perhaps I could love  you as much as I love Stephen. But not as much as Nora--oh, no, I  wouldn't love you quite as much as Nora. She was first, you see; she's  always been there. I feel sure I couldn't ever love anybody as much as  Nora.\"    One day when Stephen was out to the mackerel grounds, Paul took Miss  Trevor into the little grey house and showed her his treasures. They  climbed the ladder in one corner to the loft where Paul slept. The  window of it, small and square-paned, looked seaward, and the moan of  the sea and the pipe of the wind sounded there night and day. Paul had  many rare shells and seaweeds, curious flotsam and jetsam of shore  storms, and he had a small shelf full of books.    \"They're splendid,\" he said enthusiastically. \"Stephen brought me them  all. Every time Stephen goes to town to ship his mackerel he brings me  home a new book.\"    \"Were you ever in town yourself?\" asked Miss Trevor.    \"Oh, yes, twice. Stephen took me. It was a wonderful place. I tell  you, when I next met the Twin Sailors it was me did the talking then.  I had to tell them about all I saw and all that had happened. And Nora  was ever so interested too. The Golden Lady wasn't, though--she didn't  hardly listen.

Why did Spain's commerce decline as Portugal's thrived?      COLLATERAL READING[6]    Gibbins's History of Commerce--Chapters IV-V.    Fiske's Discovery of America, Vol. 1--Chapters IV-V.          CHAPTER III    TOPOGRAPHIC CONTROL OF COMMERCE      The great industry of commerce, which includes both the trade in the  commodities of life and the transportation of them, is governed very  largely by the character of the earth's surface. But very few  food-stuffs can be grown economically in mountain-regions. Steep  mountain-slopes are apt to be destitute of soil; moreover, even the  mountain-valleys are apt to be difficult of access, and in such cases  the cost of moving the crops may be greater than the market value of the  products. Mountainous countries, therefore, are apt to be sparsely  peopled regions.    But although the great mountain-systems are unhabitable, or at least  sparsely peopled, they have a very definite place in the economics of  life. Thus, the great western highland of the United States diverts the  flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the central  plain, and gives to the region most of its food-growing power. In a  similar manner, moisture intercepted by the Alps and the Himalayas has  not only created the plains of the Po and the Ganges from the rock-waste  carried from the slopes, but has also made them exceedingly fertile.    Mountain-ranges are also valuable for their contents. The broken  condition of the rock-folds and the rapid weathering to which they are  subjected have exposed the minerals and metals so useful in the arts of  commerce and civilization. Thus, the weathering of the Appalachian folds  has made accessible about the only available anthracite coal measures  yet worked; and the worn folds about Lake Superior have yielded the  ores that have made the United States the foremost copper and steel  manufacturing country of the world. Gold, silver, tin, lead, zinc,  platinum, granite, slate, and marble occur mainly in mountain-folds.    =Mountains and Valleys.=--Mountain-ranges are great obstacles to commerce  and intercommunication. The Greek peoples found it much easier to  scatter along the Mediterranean coast than to cross the Balkan  Mountains. For twenty years after the settlement of California, it was  easier and less expensive to send traffic by way of Cape Horn than to  carry it across the Rocky Mountains.    The deep canyons of mountainous regions are quite as difficult to  overcome as the high ranges. In modern methods of transportation a range  that cannot be surmounted may be tunnelled, and a tunnel five or six  miles in length is no uncommon feat of engineering. A canyon, however,  cannot be tunnelled, and if too wide for cantilever or suspension  bridges, a detour of many miles is necessary. In crossing a deep chasm  the route of transportation may aggregate ten or fifteen times the  distance spanned by a straight line.    Excepting the mining regions, the population of mountainous countries is  apt to be found mainly in the intermontane valleys. A reason for this is  not hard to find; the valleys are usually filled with rich soil brought  from the higher slopes and levelled by the water. The population,  therefore, is concentrated in the valley because of the food-producing  power of the land. For this reason the Sound, Willamette, and San  Joaquin-Sacramento Valleys contain the chief part of the Pacific coast  population. The Shenandoah and the Great Valley of Virginia are similar  instances.    What is true of the larger intermontane valleys is true also of the  narrow stream valleys of mountain and plateau regions. Thus, in the New  England plateau the chief growth during the past forty years has been in  the valley lands. In that time if the uplands have not suffered actual  loss, they certainly have made no material gains. Upland farming has not  proved a remunerative venture, and many of the farms have either been  abandoned or converted to other uses.    =Passes.=--Transverse valleys form very important topographic features of  mountain-regions. Inasmuch as the ranges themselves are obstacles to  communication, it follows that the latter must be concentrated at such  cross valleys or gaps as may be traversed. Khaibar Pass, a narrow defile  in the Hindu Kush Mountains, between Peshawur and Jelalabad, for many  years was the chief gateway between Europe and India. Even now the cost  of holding it is an enormous tax upon England.    Brenner, St. Gotthard, and the Mont Cenis Passes are about the only land  channels of commerce between Italy and transalpine Europe, and most of  the communication between northern Italy and the rest of Europe is  carried on by means of these passes. Every transcontinental railway of  the American continent crosses the various highlands by means of gaps  and passes, and some of them would never have been built were it not for  the existence of the passes. Fremont, South, and Marshall Passes have  been of historic importance for half a century.    The Hudson and Champlain Valley played an important part in the history  of the colonies a century before the existence of the United States, and  its importance as a gateway to eastern Canada is not likely to be  lessened. The Mohawk gap was the first practical route to be maintained  between the Atlantic seaboard and the food-producing region of the Great  Central Plain. It is to-day the most important one. It is so nearly  level that the total lift of freight going from Buffalo to tide-water is  less than five hundred feet.    [Illustration: A PASS--THE ROUTE OF A RAILWAY]    =Rivers.=--River-valleys are closely connected with the economic  development of a country. Navigable rivers are free and open highways of  communication. In newly settled countries the river is always the least  expensive means of carriage, and often it is the only one available for  the transportation of heavy goods.    In late years, since the railway has become the chief means for the  transportation of commodities, river transportation has greatly  declined. The river-valley, however, has lost none of its importance; in  most instances it is a naturally levelled and graded route, highly  suitable for the tracks of the railway. As a result, outside of the  level lands of the Great Central Plain, not far from eighty per cent. of  the railway mileage of the United States is constructed along  river-valleys.    =Plateaus.=--Plateaus are usually characterized by broken and more or less  rugged surface features. As a rule they are deficient in the amount of  rainfall necessary to produce an abundance of the grains and similar  food-stuffs, although this is by no means the case with all.    Most plateaus produce an abundance of grass, and cattle-growing is  therefore an important industry in such regions. Thus, the plateaus of  the Rocky Mountains are famous for cattle, and the same is true of the  Mexican and the South American plateaus. The Iberian plateau, including  Spain and Portugal, is noted for the merino sheep, which furnish the  finest wool known. The plateau of Iran is also noted for its wool, and  the rugs from this region cannot be imitated elsewhere in the world.    =Plains.=--Plains are of the highest importance to life and its  activities. Not only do they present fewer obstacles to  intercommunication than any other topographic features, but almost  always they are deeply covered with the fine rock-waste that forms the  chief components of soil. Plains, therefore, contain the elements of  nutrition, and are capable of supporting life to a greater extent than  either mountains or plateaus. About ninety per cent. of the world's  population dwell in the lowland plains.    The Great Central Plain of North America produces more than one-quarter  of the world's wheat, and about four-fifths of the corn. The southern  part of the great Arctic plain, and its extension, the plains of the  Baltic also yield immense quantities of grain and cattle products. The  coast-plains of the Atlantic Ocean, on both the American and the  European side, are highly productive.    River flood-plains are almost always densely peopled because of their  productivity. The bottom-lands of the Mississippi and the Yangtze Rivers  are among the chief food-producing regions of the world. Lacustrine  plains, the beds of former lakes, are also highly productive regions.  The valley of the Red River of the North is an example, and its wheat is  of a very high quality.    Fertile coast-plains and lowlands that are adjacent to good harbors, as  a rule are the most thickly peopled regions of the world. In many such  regions the density of population exceeds two hundred or more per square  mile. The reason is obvious. Life seeks that environment which yields  the greatest amount of nutrition with the least expenditure of energy.    The study of a good relief map shows that, as a rule, the Pacific Ocean  is bordered by a rugged highland, which has a more or less abrupt slope,  and a narrow coast-plain. Indeed, the latter is absent for the greater  part. The slopes of the Atlantic, on the other hand, are long and  gentle--being a thousand miles or more in width throughout the greater  part of their extent. The area of productive land is correspondingly  great, and the character of the surface features is such that  intercommunication is easy.
