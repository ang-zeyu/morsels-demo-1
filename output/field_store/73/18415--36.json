The orbiting ship was on an erratic path. Slowly the machines were  correcting, relays clicking, striving to bring it to a landing under  auto-pilot. All the ingenuity built into a mechanical brain was now  centered in landing the globe.    It was not a good landing, in fact a very bad one, for the sphere  touched a mountain side, scraped down rocks, shearing away a portion of  its outer bulk. But the mountain barrier was now between it and the base  from which the missiles had been launched, and the crash had not been  recorded on that tracking instrument. So far as the watchers several  hundred miles away knew, the warden in the sky had performed as  promised. Their first line of defense had proven satisfactory, and there  had been no unauthorized landing on Topaz.    In the wreckage of the control cabin Ruthven pawed at the fastenings of  his sling-chair. He no longer tried to suppress the moans every effort  tore out of him. Time held the whip, drove him. He rolled from his seat  to the floor, lay there gasping, as again he fought doggedly to remain  above the waves--those frightening, fast-coming waves of dark faintness.    Somehow he was crawling, crawling along a tilted surface until he gained  the well where the ladder to the lower section hung, now at an acute  angle. It was that angle which helped him to the next level.    He was too dazed to realize the meaning of the crumpled bulkheads. There  was a spur of bare rock under his hands as he edged over and around  twisted metal. The moans were now a gobbling, burbling, almost  continuous cry as he reached his goal--a small cabin still intact.    For long moments of anguish he paused by the chair there, afraid that he  could not make the last effort, raise his almost inert bulk up to the  point where he could reach the Redax release. For a second of unusual  clarity he wondered if there was any reason for this supreme ordeal,  whether any of the sleepers could be aroused. This might now be a ship  of the dead.    His right hand, his arm, and finally his bulk over the seat, he braced  himself and brought his left hand up. He could not use any of the  fingers; it was like lifting numb, heavy weights. But he lurched  forward, swept the unfeeling lump of cold flesh down against the release  in a gesture which he knew must be his final move. And, as he fell back  to the floor, Dr. Ruthven could not be certain whether he had succeeded  or failed. He tried to screw his head around, to focus his eyes upward  at that switch. Was it down or still stubbornly up, locking the sleepers  into confinement? But there was a fog between; he could not see it--or  anything.    The light in the cabin flickered, was gone as another circuit in the  broken ship failed. It was dark, too, in the small cubby below which  housed the two cages. Chance, which had snuffed out nineteen lives in  the space globe, had missed ripping open that cabin on the mountain  side. Five yards down the corridor the outside fabric of the ship was  split wide open, the crisp air native to Topaz entering, sending a  message to two keen noses through the combination of odors now pervading  the wreckage.    And the male coyote went into action. Days ago he had managed to work  loose the lower end of the mesh which fronted his cage, but his mind had  told him that a sortie inside the ship was valueless. The odd rapport  he'd had with the human brains, unknown to them, had operated to keep  him to the old role of cunning deception, which in the past had saved  countless of his species from sudden and violent death. Now with teeth  and paws he went diligently to work, urged on by the whines of his mate,  that tantalizing smell of an outside world tickling their nostrils--a  wild world, lacking the taint of man-places.    He slipped under the loosened mesh and stood up to paw at the front of  the female's cage. One forepaw caught in the latch and pressed it down,  and the weight of the door swung against him. Together they were free  now to reach the corridor and see ahead the subdued light of a strange  moon beckoning them on into the open.    The female, always more cautious than her mate, lingered behind as he  trotted forward, his ears a-prick with curiosity. Their training had  been the same since cubhood--to range and explore, but always in the  company and at the order of man. This was not according to the pattern  she knew, and she was suspicious. But to her sensitive nose the smell of  the ship was an offense, and the puffs of breeze from without enticing.  Her mate had already slipped through the break; now he barked with  excitement and wonder, and she trotted on to join him.    Above, the Redax, which had never been intended to stand rough usage,  proved to be a better survivor of the crash than most of the other  installations. Power purred along a network of lines, activated beams,  turned off and on a series of fixtures in those coffin-beds. For five of  the sleepers--nothing. The cabin which had held them was a flattened  smear against the mountain side. Three more half aroused, choked, fought  for life and breath in a darkness which was a mercifully short  nightmare, and succumbed.    But in the cabin nearest the rent through which the coyotes had escaped,  a young man sat up abruptly, looking into the dark with wide-open,  terror-haunted eyes. He clawed for purchase against the smooth edge of  the box in which he had lain, somehow got to his knees, weaving weakly  back and forth, and half fell, half pushed to the floor where he could  stand only by keeping his hold on the box.    Dazed, sick, weak, he swayed there, aware only of himself and his own  sensations. There were small sounds in the dark, a stilled moan, a  gasping sigh. But that meant nothing. Within him grew a compulsion to be  out of this place, his terror making him lurch forward.    His flailing hand rapped painfully against an upright surface which his  questing fingers identified hazily as an exit. Unconsciously he fumbled  along the surface of the door until it gave under that weak pressure.  Then he was out, his head swimming, drawn by the light behind the wall  rent.    He progressed toward that in a scrambling crawl, making his way over the  splintered skin of the globe. Then he dropped with a jarring thud onto  the mound of earth the ship had pushed before it during its downward  slide. Limply he tumbled on in a small cascade of clods and sand,  hitting against a less movable rock with force enough to roll him over  on his back and stun him again.    The second and smaller moon of Topaz swung brightly through the sky, its  weird green rays making the blood-streaked face of the explorer an alien  mask. It had passed well on to the horizon, and its large yellow  companion had risen when a yapping broke the small sounds of the night.    As the _yipp, yipp, yipp_ arose in a crescendo, the man stirred, putting  one hand to his head. His eyes opened, he looked vaguely about him and  sat up. Behind him was the torn and ripped ship, but he did not look  back at it.    Instead, he got to his feet and staggered out into the direct path of  the moonlight. Inside his brain there was a whirl of thoughts, memories,  emotions. Perhaps Ruthven or one of his assistants could have explained  that chaotic mixture for what it was. But for all practical purposes  Travis Fox--Amerindian Time Agent, member of Team A, Operation  Cochise--was far less of a thinking animal now than the two coyotes  paying their ritual addresses to a moon which was not the one of their  vanished homeland.    Travis wavered on, drawn somehow by that howling. It was familiar, a  thread of something real through all the broken clutter in his head. He  stumbled, fell, crawled up again, but he kept on.    Above, the female coyote lowered her head, drew a test sniff of a new  scent. She recognized that as part of the proper way of life. She yapped  once at her mate, but he was absorbed in his night song, his muzzle  pointed moonward as he voiced a fine wailing.    Travis tripped, pitched forward on his hands and knees, and felt the jar  of such a landing shoot up his stiffened forearms. He tried to get up,  but his body only twisted, so he landed on his back and lay looking up  at the moon.    A strong, familiar odor ... then a shadow looming above him. Hot breath  against his cheek, and the swift sweep of an animal tongue on his face.  He flung up his hand, gripped thick fur, and held on as if he had found  one anchor of sanity in a world gone completely mad.          3      Travis, one knee braced against the red earth, blinked as he parted a  screen of tall rust-brown grass with cautious fingers to look out into a  valley where golden mist clouded most of the landscape. His head ached  with dull persistence, the pain fostered in some way by his own  bewilderment. To study the land ahead was like trying to see through one  picture interposed over another and far different one. He knew what  ought to be there, but what was before him was very dissimilar.    A buff-gray shape flitted through the tall cover grass, and Travis  tensed. _Mba'a_--coyote? Or were these companions of his actually  _ga-n_, spirits who could choose their shape at will and had, oddly,  this time assumed the bodies of man's tricky enemy? Were they  _ndendai_--enemies--or _dalaanbiyat'i_, allies? In this mad world he did  not know.    _Ei'dik'e?_ His mind formed a word he did not speak: Friend?    Yellow eyes met his directly. Dimly he had been aware, ever since  awaking in this strange wilderness with the coming of morning light,  that the four-footed ones trotting with him as he walked aimlessly had  unbeastlike traits. Not only did they face him eye-to-eye, but in some  ways they appeared able to read his thoughts.    He "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25555"],[0,"Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen (#4)"],[1," through a crack in the flooring he saw the charcoal-burner asleep, his  wife almost in a faint, and by the side of the newly-born babe three  old women dressed in white, each holding a lighted taper in her hand,  and all talking together. Now these were the three Soudiche or Fates,  you must know.    The first said, \"On this boy I bestow the gift of confronting great  dangers.\"    The second said, \"I bestow the power of happily escaping all these  dangers, and of living to a good old age.\"    The third said, \"I bestow upon him for wife the princess born at the  selfsame hour as he, and daughter of the very king sleeping above in  the loft.\"    At these words the lights went out and silence reigned around.    Now the king was greatly troubled, and wondered exceedingly; he felt  as if he had received a sword-thrust in the chest. He lay awake all  night thinking how to prevent the words of the Fates from coming true.    With the first glimmer of morning light the baby began to cry. The  charcoal-burner, on going over to it, found that his wife was dead.    \"Poor little orphan,\" he said sadly, \"what will become of thee without  a mother's care?\"    \"Confide this child to me,\" said the king, \"I will look after it. He  shall be well provided for. You shall be given a sum of money large  enough to keep you without having to burn charcoal.\"    The poor man gladly agreed, and the king went away promising to send  some one for the child. The queen and courtiers thought it would be an  agreeable surprise for the king to hear that a charming little  princess had been born on the night he was away. But instead of being  pleased he frowned, and calling one of his servants, said to him, \"Go  to the charcoal-burner's cottage in the forest, and give the man this  purse in exchange for a new-born infant. On your way back drown the  child. See well that he is drowned, for if he should in any way  escape, you yourself shall suffer in his place.\"    The servant was given the child in a basket, and on reaching the  centre of a narrow bridge that stretched across a wide and deep river,  he threw both basket and baby into the water.    \"A prosperous journey to you, Mr. Son-in-Law,\" said the king, on  hearing the servant's story: for he fully believed the child was  drowned. But it was far from being the case; the little one was  floating happily along in its basket cradle, and slumbering as sweetly  as if his mother had sung him to sleep. Now it happened that a  fisherman, who was mending his nets before his cottage door, saw the  basket floating down the river. He jumped at once into his boat,  picked it up, and ran to tell his wife the good news.    \"Look,\" said he, \"you have always longed for a son; here is a  beautiful little boy the river has sent us.\"    The woman was delighted, and took the infant and loved it as her own  child. They named him _Plavacek_ (the floater), because he had come to  them floating on the water.    The river flowed on. Years passed away. The little baby grew into a  handsome youth; in all the villages round there were none to compare  with him. Now it happened that one summer day the king was riding  unattended. And the heat being very great he reined in his horse  before the fisherman's door to ask for a drink of water. Plavacek  brought the water. The king looked at him attentively, then turning to  the fisherman, said, \"That is a good-looking lad; is he your son?\"    \"He is and he isn't,\" replied the fisherman. \"I found him, when he was  quite a tiny baby, floating down the stream in a basket. So we adopted  him and brought him up as our own son.\"    The king turned as pale as death, for he guessed that he was the same  child he had ordered to be drowned. Then recovering himself he got  down from his horse and said: \"I want a trusty messenger to take a  letter to the palace, could you send him with it?\"    \"With pleasure! Your majesty may be sure of its safe delivery.\"    Thereupon the king wrote to the queen as follows--        \"The man who brings you this letter is the most dangerous of all      my enemies. Have his head cut off at once; no delay, no pity, he      must be executed before my return. Such is my will and      pleasure.\"    [Illustration]    This he carefully folded and sealed with the royal seal.    Plavacek took the letter and set off immediately. But the forest  through which he had to pass was so large, and the trees so thick,  that he missed the path and was overtaken by the darkness before the  journey was nearly over. In the midst of his trouble he met an old  woman who said, \"Where are you going, Plavacek? Where are you going?\"    \"I am the bearer of a letter from the king to the queen, but have  missed the path to the palace. Could you, good mother, put me on the  right road?\"    \"Impossible to-day, my child; it is getting dark, and you would not  have time to get there. Stay with me to-night. You will not be with  strangers, for I am your godmother.\"    Plavacek agreed. Thereupon they entered a pretty little cottage that  seemed suddenly to sink into the earth. Now while he slept the old  woman changed his letter for another, which ran thus:--        \"Immediately upon the receipt of this letter introduce the      bearer to the princess our daughter. I have chosen this young      man for my son-in-law, and it is my wish they should be married      before my return to the palace. Such is my pleasure.\"    The letter was duly delivered, and when the queen had read it, she  ordered everything to be prepared for the wedding. Both she and her  daughter greatly enjoyed Plavacek's society, and nothing disturbed the  happiness of the newly married pair.    Within a few days the king returned, and on hearing what had taken  place was very angry with the queen.    \"But you expressly bade me have the wedding before your return. Come,  read your letter again, here it is,\" said she.    He closely examined the letter; the paper, handwriting, seal--all were  undoubtedly his. He then called his son-in-law, and questioned him  about his journey. Plavacek hid nothing: he told how he had lost his  way, and how he had passed the night in a cottage in the forest.    \"What was the old woman like?\" asked the king.    From Plavacek's description the king knew it was the very same who,  twenty years before, had foretold the marriage of the princess with  the charcoal-burner's son. After some moments' thought the king said,  \"What is done is done. But you will not become my son-in-law so  easily. No, i' faith! As a wedding present you must bring me three  golden hairs from the head of Dede-Vsevede.\"    In this way he thought to get rid of his son-in-law, whose very  presence was distasteful to him. The young fellow took leave of his  wife and set off. \"I know not which way to go,\" said he to himself,  \"but my godmother the witch will surely help me.\"    But he found the way easily enough. He walked on and on and on for a  long time over mountain, valley, and river, until he reached the  shores of the Black Sea. There he found a boat and boatman.    \"May God bless you, old boatman,\" said he.    \"And you, too, my young traveller. Where are you going?\"    \"To Dede-Vsevede's castle for three of his golden hairs.\"    \"Ah, then you are very welcome. For a long weary while I have been  waiting for such a messenger as you. I have been ferrying passengers  across for these twenty years, and not one of them has done anything  to help me. If you will promise to ask Dede-Vsevede when I shall be  released from my toil I will row you across.\"    Plavacek promised, and was rowed to the opposite bank. He continued  his journey on foot until he came in sight of a large town half in  ruins, near which was passing a funeral procession. The king of that  country was following his father's coffin, and with the tears running  down his cheeks.    \"May God comfort you in your distress,\" said Plavacek.    \"Thank you, good traveller. Where are you going?\"    \"To the house of Dede-Vsevede in quest of three of his golden hairs.\"    \"To the house of Dede-Vsevede? indeed! What a pity you did not come  sooner, we have long been expecting such a messenger as you. Come and  see me by and bye.\"    When Plavacek presented himself at court the king said to him:    \"We understand you are on your way to the house of Dede-Vsevede? Now  we have an apple-tree here that bears the fruit of everlasting youth.  One of these apples eaten by a man, even though he be dying, will cure  him and make him young again. For the last twenty years neither fruit  nor flower has been found on this tree. Will you ask Dede-Vsevede the  cause of it?\"    \"That I will, with pleasure.\"    Then Plavacek continued his journey, and as he went he came to a large  and beautiful city where all was sad and silent. Near the gate was an  old man who leant on a stick and walked with difficulty.    \"May God bless you, good old man.\"    \"And you, too, my handsome young traveller. Where are you going?\"    \"To Dede-Vsevede's palace in search of three of his golden hairs.\"    \"Ah, you are the very messenger I have so long waited for. Allow me to  take you to my master the king.\"    On their arrival at the palace, the king said, \"I hear you are an  ambassador to Dede-Vsevede. We have here a well, the water of which  renews itself. So wonderful are its effects that invalids are  immediately cured on drinking it, while a few drops sprinkled on a  corpse will bring it to life again. For the past twenty years this  well has remained dry: if you will ask old Dede-Vsevede how the flow  of water may be restored I will reward you royally.\"    Plavacek promised to do so, and was dismissed with good wishes. He  then travelled through deep dark forests, in the midst of which might  be seen a large meadow; out of it grew lovely flowers, and in the  centre stood a castle built of gold. It was the home of Dede-Vsevede.  So brilliant with light was it that it seemed to be built of fire.  When "]]]
