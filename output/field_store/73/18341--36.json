He had infinite fund of  anecdote, remembered everyone he had ever seen, and was kindly to all.  John Tyler is said to have wept when Clay failed of the Presidential  nomination in the Whig Convention of 1839.    [1840]    Clay's vices and inconsistencies were readily forgiven. He had denounced  duelling as barbarous, yet when sharp-tongued John Randolph referred to  him and Adams as having, in 1825, formed \"the coalition of Blifil and  Black George, the combination of the Puritan and the blackleg\"--for Clay  gambled--Clay challenged him. They met, the diminutive Randolph being in  his dressing-gown. Neither was hurt, as Randolph fired in air and Clay  was no shot. Being asked why he did not kill Randolph, Clay said: \"I  aimed at the part of his gown where I thought he was, but when the  bullet got there he had moved.\" In 1842, when Lord Ashburton was in  Washington, there was a famous whist game, my lord, with Mr. Crittenden,  playing against Clay and the Russian Minister, Count Bodisco, while  Webster looked on. \"What shall the stake be?\" asked his lordship. \"Out  of deference to Her Majesty,\" said Clay, \"we will make it a sovereign.\"      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Randolph.  From a picture by Jarvis in 1811, at the New York Historical Society.      Emphatically patriotic, super-eminent in debate, ambitious, adventurous  in political diplomacy, a hard worker, incessant in activity for his  party, temperate upon the slavery question, whole-souled in every  measure or policy calculated to advance nationality, this versatile man  may be put down as foremost among the leaders of the Whig Party from its  origin till his death.        CHAPTER II.    FLORIDA AND THE MONROE DOCTRINE    [1816]    It was a delicate question after the Louisiana purchase how much  territory it embraced east of the Mississippi. Louisiana had under  France, till 1762, reached the Perdido, Florida's western boundary at  present, and was \"retroceded\" by Spain to France in 1800 \"with the same  extent that it had when France possessed it.\" The United States of  course succeeded to whatever France thus recovered. Spain claimed still  to own West Florida, the name given by Great Britain on receiving it  from France in 1763 to the part of Louisiana between the Perdido and the  Mississippi. Spain had never acquired the district from France, but  obtained it by conquest from Great Britain during our Revolution.    This claim by Spain, based only on the \"retro\" in the treaty of 1800,  our Government viewed as fanciful, regarding West Florida undoubtedly  ours through the Louisiana purchase. Spain was intractable, first of  herself, later still more so through Napoleon's dictation. Hence our  offer, in Jefferson's time, to avoid war, of a lump sum for the two  Floridas was spurned by her. In 1810 and 1811, to save it from  anarchy--also to save it from Great Britain or France, now in the  whitest heat of their contest for Spain--we occupied West Florida, as  certainly entitled to it against those powers, yet with no view of  precluding further negotiations with Spain. When in 1812 Louisiana  became a State, its eastern boundary ran as now, including a goodly  portion of the region in debate.    [1817]    The necessity of acquiring East Florida, too, was more and more  apparent. That country was without rule, full of filibusterers,  privateers, hostile refugee Creeks and runaway negroes, of whose  services the English had availed themselves freely during the war of  1812, when Spaniards and English made Florida a perpetual base for  hostile raids into our territory.  A fort then built by the English on  the Appalachicola and left intact at the peace with some arms and  ammunition, had been occupied by the negroes, who, from this retreat,  menaced the peace beyond the line. Spain could not preserve law and  order here. This was perhaps a sufficient excuse for the act of General  Gaines in crossing into Florida and bombarding the negro fort, July 27,  1816. Amelia Island, on the Florida coast, a nest of lawless men from  every nation, was in 1817 also seized by the United States with the same  propriety. Knowledge that Spain resented these acts encouraged the  Floridians. Collisions continually occurred all along the line, finally  growing into general hostility. Such was the origin of the First  Seminole War.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  James Monroe. From a painting by Gilbert Stuart--now the property of T.  Jefferson Coolidge.      [1818]    December, 1817, Jackson was placed in command in Georgia. To clear out  the filibusterers, the chief source of the Indians' discontent ever  since before the Creek War, the hero of New Orleans, mistakenly  supposing himself to be fortified by his Government's concurrence,  boldly took forcible possession of all East Florida. Ambrister and  Arbuthnot, two officious English subjects found there, he put to death.    This procedure was quite characteristic of Old Hickory. He acted upon  the theory that by the law of nations any citizen of one land making war  upon another land, the two being at peace, becomes an outlaw.  International law has no such doctrine, and most likely the maxim  occurred to Jackson rather as an excuse after the act than in the way of  forethought. Nor was it ever proved that the two victims were guilty as  Jackson alleged. With him this probably made little difference. Having  undertaken to quiet the Floridian outbreaks he was determined to  accomplish his end, whatever the consequences of some of his means.    With the country the New Orleans victor, who had now dared to hang a  British subject, was ten times a hero, but the deed confused and  troubled Monroe's cabinet not a little. Calhoun wished General Jackson  censured, while all his cabinet colleagues disapproved his high-handed  acts and stood ready to disavow them with reparation. On this occasion  Jackson owed much to one whom he subsequently hated and denounced, viz.,  Quincy Adams, by whose bold and acute defence of his doubtful doings,  managed with a fineness of argument and diplomacy which no then American  but Adams could command, he was formally vindicated before both his own  Government and the Governments of England and Spain.    The posts seized had of course to be given up, yet our bold invasion had  rendered Spain willing at last to sell Florida, while Great Britain,  wishing our countenance in her opposition to the anti-progressive,  misnamed Holy Alliance of continental monarchs, concurred. Spain after  all got the better of the bargain, as we surrendered all claim to Texas,  which the Louisiana purchase had really made ours.    [1823]    The Florida imbroglio nursed to its first public utterance a sentiment  which has ever since been spontaneously taken as a principle of American  public policy, almost as if it were a part of our law itself. Spain's  American dependencies had been sensible enough to avail themselves of  that land's distraction in Napoleon's time, to set up as states on their  own account. She naturally wanted them back. Ferdinand VII. withheld  till 1820 his signature of the treaty ceding Florida, in order to  prevent--which, after all, it did not--our recognition of these  revolted provinces as independent nations. Backed by the powerful  Austrian minister, Metternich, and by the Holy Alliance, France, having  aided Ferdinand to suppress at home the liberal rebellion of 1820-23,  began to moot plans for subduing the new Spanish-American States. Great  Britain opposed this, out of motives partly commercial, partly  philanthropic, partly relating to international law, yet was unwilling  so early to recognize the independence of those nations as the United  States had done.    Assured at least of England's moral support, President Monroe in his  message of December, 1823, declared that we should consider any attempt  on the part of the allied monarchs \"to extend their system to any  portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety,\" and  any interposition by them to oppress the young republics or to control  their destiny, \"as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward  the United States.\" This, in kernel, is the first part of Monroe's  doctrine.    The second part added: \"The American continents, by the free and  independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are  henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by  any European powers.\" The meaning of this was that the mere hap of first  occupancy on the continent by the citizens of any country would not any  longer be recognized by us as giving that country a title to the spot  occupied.    These important doctrines--for though akin in principle they are really  two--were no sudden creation of individual thought, but the result  rather of slow processes in the public mind. Germs of the first are  traceable to Washington; express statements of both, yet not essentially  detracting from Monroe's originality, to Jefferson. Both were put in  form by Quincy Adams, Monroe's Secretary of State. Especially Monroe's,  we believe, is the second, a resolution to which Russia's advance down  the Pacific coast, and more still the recent vexations from the  proximity of Spain in Florida, had pushed him.        CHAPTER III.    THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE    Louisiana having become a State in 1812, that portion of the purchase  north of the thirty-third degree took the name of the Missouri  Territory. St. Louis was its centre of population and of influence.    [1818]    Being found in this extensive domain at the purchase, slavery had never  been hindered in its growth. It had therefore taken firm root and was  popular. The application, early in 1818, of the densest part of Missouri  Territory for admission into the Union as a slave State, called  attention to this threatening status of slavery beyond the Mississippi,  and occasioned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#4)"],[1,"their fondness for  each other's society only at roosting time; during the day they are  obliged to separate, in order to find the wherewithal to feed upon.    Like all sociable birds, the black-throated jay is very noisy. Birds  have a language of a kind, a language composed entirely of  interjections, a language in which only the simplest emotions--fear,  joy, hunger, and maternal care--can be expressed. Now, when a  considerable flock of birds is wandering through a dense forest, it  is obvious that the individuals which compose it would be very liable  to lose touch with one another had they no means of informing one  another of their whereabouts. The result is that such a means has  been developed. Every bird, whose habit it is to go about in company,  has the habit of continually uttering some kind of call or cry. It  probably does this unconsciously, without being aware that it is  making any sound.    In Madras a white-headed babbler nestling was once brought to me.  I took charge of it and fed it, and noticed that when it was not asleep  it kept up a continuous cheeping all day long, even when it was eating,  although it had no companion. The habit of continually uttering its  note was inherited. When the flock is stationary the note is a  comparatively low one; but when an individual makes up its mind to  fly any distance, say ten or a dozen yards, it gives vent to a louder  call, so as to inform its companions that it is moving. This sound  seems to induce others to follow its lead. This is especially  noticeable in the case of the white-throated laughing-thrush. I have  seen one of these birds fly to a branch in a tree, uttering its curious  call, and then hop on to another branch in the same tree. Scarcely  has it left the first branch when a second laughing-thrush flies to  it; then a fourth, a fifth, and so on; so that the birds look as though  they might be playing \"Follow the man from Cook's.\" The black-throated  jay is noisy even for a sociable bird. The sound which it seems to  produce more often than any other is very like the harsh anger-cry  of the common myna. Many Himalayan birds have rather discordant notes,  and in this respect these mountains do not compare favourably with  the Nilgiris, where the blithe notes of the bulbuls are very pleasing  to the ear.    Jays are by nature bold birds. They are inclined to be timid in England,  because they are so much persecuted by the game-keeper. In the  Himalayas they are as bold as the crow. It is not uncommon to see  two or three jays hopping about outside a kitchen picking up the scraps  pitched out by the cook. Sometimes two jays make a dash at the same  morsel. Then a tiff ensues, but it is mostly made up of menacing  screeches. One bird bears away the coveted morsel, swearing lustily,  and the unsuccessful claimant lets him go in peace. When a jay comes  upon a morsel of food too large to be swallowed whole, it flies with  it to a tree and holds it under one foot and tears it up with its  beak. This is a characteristically corvine habit. The black-throated  jay is an exceedingly restless bird; it is always on the move. Like  its English cousin, it is not a bird of very powerful flight. As  Gilbert White says: \"Magpies and jays flutter with powerless wings,  and make no despatch.\" In the Himalayas there is no necessity for  it to make much despatch; it rarely has to cover any distance on the  wing. When it does fly a dozen yards or so, its passage is marked  by much noisy flapping of the pinions.    The nutcrackers can scarcely be numbered among the common birds, but  are sometimes seen in our hill stations, and, such is the \"cussedness\"  of birds that if I omit to notice the nutcrackers several are certain  to show themselves to many of those who read these lines. A  chocolate-brown bird, bigger than a crow, and spotted and barred with  white all over, can be nothing other than one of the Himalayan  nutcrackers. It may be the Himalayan species (_Nucifraga hemispila_),  or the larger spotted nutcracker (_N. multipunctata_).    The members of the crow family which I have attempted to describe  above are all large birds, birds bigger than a crow. It now behoves  us to consider the smaller members of the corvine clan.    The tits form a sub-family of the crows. Now at first sight the crow  and the tit seem to have but little in common. However, close  inspection, whether by the anatomist or the naturalist, reveals the  mark of the corvidae in the tits. First, there is the habit of holding  food under the foot while it is being devoured. Then there is the  aggressiveness of the tits. This is Lloyd-Georgian or even Winstonian  in its magnitude. \"Tits,\" writes Jerdon, \"are excessively bold and  even ferocious, the larger ones occasionally destroying young and  sickly birds, both in a wild state and in confinement.\"    Many species of tit dwell in the Himalayas. To describe them all would  bewilder the reader; I will, therefore, content myself with brief  descriptions of four species, each of which is to be seen daily in  every hill station of the Western Himalayas.    The green-backed tit (_Parus monticola_) is a glorified edition of  our English great tit. It is a bird considerably smaller than a  sparrow.    The cheeks are white, the rest of the head is black, as are the breast  and a characteristic line running along the abdomen. The back is  greenish yellow, the lower parts are deep yellow. The wings are black  with two white bars, the tail is black tipped with white. This is  one of the commonest birds in most hill stations.    Like the sparrow, it is ever ready to rear up its brood in a hole  in the wall of a house. Any kind of a hole will do, provided the aperture  is too small to admit of the entrance of birds larger than itself.    The nesting operations of a pair of green-backed tits form the subject  of a separate essay.    Another tit much in evidence is the yellow-cheeked tit, _Machlolophus  xanthogenys_. I apologise for its scientific name. Take a  green-backed tit, paint its cheeks bright yellow, and give it a black  crest tipped with yellow, and you will have transformed him into a  yellow-cheeked tit.    There remain to be described two pigmy tits. The first of these is  that feathered exquisite, the red-headed tit (_AEgithaliscus  erythrocephalus_). I will not again apologise for the name; it must  suffice that the average ornithologist is never happy unless he be  either saddling a small bird with a big name or altering the  denomination of some unfortunate fowl. This fussy little mite is not  so long as a man's thumb. It is crestless; the spot where the crest  ought to be is chestnut red. The remainder of the upper plumage is  bluish grey, while the lower plumage is the colour of rust. The black  face is set off by a white eyebrow. Last, but not least, of our common  tits is the crested black tit (_Lophophanes melanopterus_). The  crested head and breast of this midget are black. The cheeks and nape  are white, while the rest of the upper plumage is iron grey.    There is yet another tit of which mention must be made, because he  is the common tit of Almora. The climate of Almora is so much milder  than that of other hill stations that its birds are intermediate  between those of the hills and the plains. The Indian grey tit (_Parus  atriceps_) is a bird of wide distribution. It is the common tit of  the Nilgiris, is found in many of the better-wooded parts of the plains,  and ascends the Himalayas up to 6000 feet. It is a grey bird with  the head, neck, breast, and abdominal line black. The cheeks are white.  It is less gregarious than the other tits. Its notes are harsh and  varied, being usually a _ti-ti-chee_ or _pretty-pretty_.    I have not noticed this species at either Mussoorie or Naini Tal,  but, as I have stated, it is common at Almora.    As has been mentioned above, tits usually go about in flocks. It is  no uncommon thing for a flock to contain all of the four species of  tit just described, a number of white-eyes, some nuthatches, warblers,  tree-creepers, a woodpecker or two, and possibly some sibias and  laughing-thrushes.      THE CRATEROPODIDAE OR BABBLER FAMILY    The Crateropodidae form a most heterogeneous collection of birds,  including, as they do, such divers fowls as babblers,  whistling-thrushes, bulbuls, and white-eyes. Whenever a systematist  comes across an Asiatic bird of which he can make nothing, he classes  it among the Crateropodidae. This is convenient for the systematist,  but embarrassing for the naturalist.    The most characteristic members of the family are those ugly, untidy,  noisy earth-coloured birds which occur everywhere in the plains, and  always go about in little companies, whence their popular name \"seven  sisters.\"    To men of science these birds are known as babblers. Babblers proper  are essentially birds of the plains. In the hills they are replaced  by their cousins, the laughing-thrushes. Laughing-thrushes are  merely glorified babblers. The Himalayan streaked laughing-thrush  (_Trochalopterum lineatum_) is one of the commonest of the birds of  our hill stations. It is a reddish brown fowl, about eight inches  long. Each of its feathers has a black shaft; it is these dark shafts  that give the bird its streaked appearance. Its chin, throat, and  breast are chestnut-red, and on each cheek there is a patch of similar  hue. The general appearance of the streaked laughing-thrush is that  of one of the seven sisters who is wearing her best frock. Like their  sisters of the plains, Himalayan streaked laughing-thrushes go about  in small flocks and are exceedingly noisy. Sometimes a number of them  assemble, apparently for the sole purpose of holding a speaking  competition. They are never so happy as when thus engaged.    Streaked laughing-thrushes frequent gardens, and, as they are  inordinately fond of hearing their own voices, it is certainly not  their fault if"]]]
