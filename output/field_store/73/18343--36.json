I think the  slaves felt the deprivation less than the whites, because the usual diet  for slaves was corn bread and pork, and these could be raised on the  plantation; but coffee, tea, sugar, and other articles which the whites  had been accustomed to use could not be raised on the plantation, and  the conditions brought about by the war frequently made it impossible  to secure these things. The whites were often in great straits. Parched  corn was used for coffee, and a kind of black molasses was used instead  of sugar. Many times nothing was used to sweeten the so-called tea and  coffee.    The first pair of shoes that I recall wearing were wooden ones. They  had rough leather on the top, but the bottoms, which were about an  inch thick, were of wood. When I walked they made a fearful noise, and  besides this they were very inconvenient, since there was no yielding  to the natural pressure of the foot. In wearing them one presented an  exceedingly awkward appearance. The most trying ordeal that I was forced  to endure as a slave boy, however, was the wearing of a flax shirt. In  the portion of Virginia where I lived it was common to use flax as part  of the clothing for the slaves. That part of the flax from which our  clothing was made was largely the refuse, which of course was the  cheapest and roughest part. I can scarcely imagine any torture, except,  perhaps, the pulling of a tooth, that is equal to that caused by putting  on a new flax shirt for the first time. It is almost equal to the  feeling that one would experience if he had a dozen or more chestnut  burrs, or a hundred small pin-points, in contact with his flesh. Even  to this day I can recall accurately the tortures that I underwent when  putting on one of these garments. The fact that my flesh was soft and  tender added to the pain. But I had no choice. I had to wear the flax  shirt or none; and had it been left to me to choose, I should have  chosen to wear no covering. In connection with the flax shirt, my  brother John, who is several years older than I am, performed one of  the most generous acts that I ever heard of one slave relative doing for  another. On several occasions when I was being forced to wear a new flax  shirt, he generously agreed to put it on in my stead and wear it for  several days, till it was \"broken in.\" Until I had grown to be quite a  youth this single garment was all that I wore.    One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was bitter  feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the  fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war  which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was  successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true,  and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the  South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency. During  the Civil War one of my young masters was killed, and two were severely  wounded. I recall the feeling of sorrow which existed among the slaves  when they heard of the death of \"Mars' Billy.\" It was no sham sorrow,  but real. Some of the slaves had nursed \"Mars' Billy\"; others had played  with him when he was a child. \"Mars' Billy\" had begged for mercy in  the case of others when the overseer or master was thrashing them. The  sorrow in the slave quarter was only second to that in the \"big house.\"  When the two young masters were brought home wounded, the sympathy of  the slaves was shown in many ways. They were just as anxious to assist  in the nursing as the family relatives of the wounded. Some of the  slaves would even beg for the privilege of sitting up at night to nurse  their wounded masters. This tenderness and sympathy on the part of those  held in bondage was a result of their kindly and generous nature. In  order to defend and protect the women and children who were left on the  plantations when the white males went to war, the slaves would have laid  down their lives. The slave who was selected to sleep in the \"big house\"  during the absence of the males was considered to have the place of  honour. Any one attempting to harm \"young Mistress\" or \"old Mistress\"  during the night would have had to cross the dead body of the slave to  do so. I do not know how many have noticed it, but I think that it will  be found to be true that there are few instances, either in slavery  or freedom, in which a member of my race has been known to betray a  specific trust.    As a rule, not only did the members of my race entertain no feelings of  bitterness against the whites before and during the war, but there are  many instances of Negroes tenderly caring for their former masters and  mistresses who for some reason have become poor and dependent since the  war. I know of instances where the former masters of slaves have for  years been supplied with money by their former slaves to keep them from  suffering. I have known of still other cases in which the former slaves  have assisted in the education of the descendants of their former  owners. I know of a case on a large plantation in the South in which a  young white man, the son of the former owner of the estate, has become  so reduced in purse and self-control by reason of drink that he is a  pitiable creature; and yet, notwithstanding the poverty of the coloured  people themselves on this plantation, they have for years supplied this  young white man with the necessities of life. One sends him a little  coffee or sugar, another a little meat, and so on. Nothing that the  coloured people possess is too good for the son of \"old Mars' Tom,\" who  will perhaps never be permitted to suffer while any remain on the place  who knew directly or indirectly of \"old Mars' Tom.\"    I have said that there are few instances of a member of my race  betraying a specific trust. One of the best illustrations of this which  I know of is in the case of an ex-slave from Virginia whom I met not  long ago in a little town in the state of Ohio. I found that this man  had made a contract with his master, two or three years previous to  the Emancipation Proclamation, to the effect that the slave was to be  permitted to buy himself, by paying so much per year for his body; and  while he was paying for himself, he was to be permitted to labour where  and for whom he pleased. Finding that he could secure better wages in  Ohio, he went there. When freedom came, he was still in debt to his  master some three hundred dollars. Notwithstanding that the Emancipation  Proclamation freed him from any obligation to his master, this black man  walked the greater portion of the distance back to where his old master  lived in Virginia, and placed the last dollar, with interest, in his  hands. In talking to me about this, the man told me that he knew that  he did not have to pay the debt, but that he had given his word to the  master, and his word he had never broken. He felt that he could not  enjoy his freedom till he had fulfilled his promise.    From some things that I have said one may get the idea that some of the  slaves did not want freedom. This is not true. I have never seen one who  did not want to be free, or one who would return to slavery.    I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is  so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long  since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the Southern  white people on account of the enslavement of my race. No one section of  our country was wholly responsible for its introduction, and, besides,  it was recognized and protected for years by the General Government.  Having once got its tentacles fastened on to the economic and social  life of the Republic, it was no easy matter for the country to relieve  itself of the institution. Then, when we rid ourselves of prejudice, or  racial feeling, and look facts in the face, we must acknowledge that,  notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery, the ten million  Negroes inhabiting this country, who themselves or whose ancestors  went through the school of American slavery, are in a stronger and more  hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously,  than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of  the globe. This is so to such an extent that Negroes in this country,  who themselves or whose forefathers went through the school of slavery,  are constantly returning to Africa as missionaries to enlighten those  who remained in the fatherland. This I say, not to justify slavery--on  the other hand, I condemn it as an institution, as we all know that in  America it was established for selfish and financial reasons, and not  from a missionary motive--but to call attention to a fact, and to  show how Providence so often uses men and institutions to accomplish  a purpose. When persons ask me in these days how, in the midst of what  sometimes seem hopelessly discouraging conditions, I can have such  faith in the future of my race in this country, I remind them of the  wilderness through which and out of which, a good Providence has already  led us.    Ever since I have been old enough to think for myself, I have  entertained the idea that, notwithstanding the cruel wrongs inflicted  upon us, the black man got nearly as much out of slavery as the white  man did. The hurtful influences of the institution were not by any means  confined to the Negro. This was fully illustrated by the life upon our  own plantation. The whole machinery of slavery was so constructed as to  cause labour, as a rule, to be looked upon as a badge of degradation,  of inferiority. Hence labour was something that both races on the slave  plantation sought to escape. The slave system on our place, in a large  measure, took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white  people.

A beautiful dull  gloss so much sought by finishers of modern furniture will be the result  of carefully following these directions.          HOME-MADE MISSION CANDLESTICK      There are many kinds of mission candlesticks, but few of them carry out  the mission design throughout. Herewith is illustrated a candlestick  which may be made from the various woods that will have the style and  lines of mission craft work. The base is made from 1-in. material, 4-1/2  in. square. Two holes are bored and countersunk for screws to hold the  post and handle. The post is 2-1/4 in. high, bored in one end to fit the  size of a candle. The post is covered with a 3/8-in. thick cap, 2 in.  square. This, also, is bored to fit the candle. The handle is 3/8 in.  thick and 3 in. long with a 3/8-in. square mortise and is notched to fit  the base. The wood may be selected to match any other piece of furniture  and finished in any of the mission stains.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Details of Candlestick]          ANOTHER STYLE OF MISSION CHAIR      The material necessary to make a mission chair as shown in the  accompanying illustration may be secured from a planing mill with all  four surfaces squared and sandpapered. The mill can do this work quickly  and the expense will be nothing compared with the time it takes to do  the work by hand.    The following is the stock list:      4 legs, 2-1/2 by 2-1/2 by 32-1/2 in.    2 bottom end rails 7/8 by 5-3/4 by 23-1/2 in.    2 bottom side rails 7/8 by 5-3/4 by 28-1/2 in.    2 top end rails 7/8 by 4-1/2 by 23-1/2 in.    1 top back rail 7/8 by 4-1/2 by 28-1/2 in.    2 cleats 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 26-1/2 in.    7 slats 1/2 by 2 by 24 in.    This design was purposely made simple. If it is considered too severe  and the worker has had some experience in woodwork, it can easily be  modified by adding vertical slats in back and sides. These should be  made of 1/2-in. stock and their ends should be \"let into\" the rails by  means of mortises.    Either plain red oak or quarter-sawed white oak will do. Begin by  squaring up one end of each leg, marking and cutting them to length and  planing up the second ends so that they shall be square. Both the top  and bottom of each leg should be beveled or rounded off about 1/4 in. so  that they may not splinter or cause injury to the hand.    When all of the legs have been made of the same length, set them on end  in the positions they are to have relative to one another and mark with  pencil the approximate locations of the mortises. Next, place them on  the bench, side by side, even the ends and square sharp lines across  to indicate the ends of the mortises. The drawing shows the dimensions  to use. A sharp pencil should be used for this marking and the lines  should be carried entirely across the two faces of each piece.    [Illustration: Mission Chair Complete]    Set the gauge for the side of the mortise nearest the face edge. With  this setting, mark all the mortises, then set for the second side of the  mortise and complete the gauging.    There are two ways of cutting small mortises in common use. One is by  using a chisel of a width just equal to that of the mortise. The other  is by using a smaller chisel after the mortise has first been bored with  the brace and bit. In the first method the cutting is begun at the  middle of the mortise where a V-shaped opening is made the full depth of  the mortise that is to be. Continuing from the middle, vertical cuts are  taken first toward one end and then toward the other. The chips are  pried out as the cutting proceeds. In making the last cut this prying  must be omitted, otherwise the edge of the mortise would be ruined. It  will be necessary to stand so as to look along the opening in order to  get the sides plumb.    This method of cutting, when once the \"knack\" has been attained, will be  found much easier, quicker and more accurate for small openings, such as  these, than the usual method. The second method, which is the usual one,  needs no description.    [Illustration: Details of Mission Chair Construction]    The rails should next have the tenons cut on their ends. It may not be  out of place to remind the amateur that the lengths of the various like  pieces can best be laid off by placing them on the bench, measuring off  the proper distances on one of them and then with try-square marking  across the edges of all of them at once. This not only saves time in  that but one set of measurements need be made, but it insures all the  pieces being similarly laid off. In measuring off for the shoulders of  the tenons, begin at the middle of the length of the rail and measure  half of the distance each way. By doing so, if there are any slight  differences in the lengths of the pieces this difference will be divided  between the two tenons and no harm will be done.    In gauging the tenons take the precaution to mark a working face and  joint edge, even if all the surfaces were finish-planed at the mill. It  is very important that all tenon gauging be done from these faces. The  same is true of the legs or posts, and the slats if there are to be any.    To avoid confusion it is well to number each tenon by means of the  chisel with a Roman numeral and its corresponding mortise with the same.  This will prevent the fitting of one tenon into more than one mortise.    Put the parts together with warm glue if it can be had, otherwise use  the prepared cold glue. In cold weather the wood ought to be warmed  before the glue is applied. Put the ends of the chair together first.  When the glue has set on these put the other rails in place.    When clamping up the second set of rails make sure the frame of the  chair is square. The best way to test for squareness is to measure the  diagonals with a stick. Spring the frame until they measure alike, using  a brace to hold the frame in position until the glue can harden.    Before staining, scrape off any surplus glue, for stain will not adhere  to glue and a white spot will be the result of failing to remove it.  Fasten cleats to the front and back rails with screws. To these cleats  fasten the slats as shown in the drawing. A cushion of Spanish leather,  such as is shown in the photograph, can be bought at the furniture store  or the upholsterer's. It can be made by the amateur quite easily,  however. The two parts are fastened together with leather thongs and the  filling is of hair or elastic felt. A cushion for the back might well be  provided.    To finish the wood to match a brown leather proceed as follows: With a  cloth or brush, stain the wood with brown Flemish water stain diluted by  the addition of four parts of water. When this has dried, sandpaper  smooth, using No. 00 paper held on the tips of the fingers. Apply a dark  brown filler. When this has flatted, i.e., when the gloss has  disappeared, which will be in the course of ten or fifteen minutes, wipe  off clean with excelsior and then with waste or a cloth. Allow this to  dry over night, then apply two or three coats of wax. Polish each coat  with a flannel cloth by briskly rubbing it.    A settle can be made after this design by using longer front and back  rails. Rails 42 in. between shoulders will make a good length for a  settle.          HOW TO MAKE AND FINISH A MAGAZINE STAND      For the magazine stand shown herewith there will be needed the following  pieces:      1 top, 7/8 in. by 15-1/2 in. by 16-1/2 in.    1 shelf, 7/8 in. by 11-1/2 in. by 12-1/2 in.    1 shelf, 7/8 in. by 12-1/2 in. by 14-3/4 in.    1 shelf, 7/8 in. by 13-1/2 in. by 16-1/2 in.    2 sides, 7/8 in. by 14-1/2 in. by 33-1/2 in.    1 brace, 7/8 in. by 3-1/4 in. by 17 in.    1 brace, 7/8 in. by 2-1/2 in. by 11-1/2 in.    6 braces, 7/8 in. by 2 in. by 2 in.    Order these pieces mill-planed on two surfaces to the thickness  specified above and also sandpapered. Quarter-sawed white oak makes the  best appearance of all the woods that are comparatively easy to obtain.  Plain sawed red or white oak will look well but are more liable to warp  than the quarter-sawed. This is quite an element in pieces as wide as  these.    Begin work on the sides first. Plane a joint edge on each and from this  work the two ends. The ends will be square to the joint edge but beveled  to the working face. A bevel square will be needed for testing these  beveled ends.    To set the bevel make a drawing, full size or nearly so, of the front  view and place the bevel on the drawing, adjusting its sides to the  angle wanted. Work from a center line in laying off the drawing.    Having planed the ends, lay off the sides. This is done by measuring  from the joint edge along the bottom 14 in., from the joint edge along  the top 1-1/2 in. and from this 11 in. Connect the points by means of a  pencil and straightedge.    [Illustration: Completed Stand]    Before cutting off the joint edges of the pieces measure off and square  lines across to indicate the locations of the shelves. Put both pieces  together and mark across both joint edges at once to insure getting both  laid off alike.    The design at the bottom can be varied to suit the fancy of the worker.  For such a design as is shown, draw on paper, full size, half of it;  fold on the center line and with scissors cut both sides of the outline  by cutting along the line just drawn. Trace around this pattern on the  wood, and saw out with compass or turning saw.    The shelves may now be made. The bevel of the ends of the shelves will  be the same as for the ends of the side pieces. The lengths may be  obtained by measuring the drawing. Remember that length is always  measured along the grain and that the end grain of the shelves must  extend from side to side in this stand. The widths may be obtained by  measuring the width of the sides at the points marked out on them for  the location of the shelf ends. It is best not to have the shelves"]]]
