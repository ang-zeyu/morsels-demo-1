The audience  rose _en masse_ and clapped their hands. And this was at an incident in  fiction: what would they have done, must we suppose, if it had been in  real life? You can easily see what a natural feeling it is, when men  who would not have had the resolution to act thus themselves, shewed how  right they thought it in another.    I don't think I have any more to say about friendship. If there is any  more, and I have no doubt there is much, you must, if you care to do so,  consult those who profess to discuss such matters.    _Fannius_. We would rather apply to you. Yet I have often consulted  such persons, and have heard what they had to say with a certain  satisfaction. But in your discourse one somehow feels that there is a  different strain.    _Scaevola_. You would have said that still more, Fannius, if you had  been present the other day in Scipio's pleasure-grounds when we had  the discussion about the State. How splendidly he stood up for justice  against Philus's elaborate speech.    _Fannius_. Ah! it was naturally easy for the justest of men to stand up  for justice.    _Scaevola_. Well, then, what about friendship? Who could discourse on  it more easily than the man whose chief glory is a friendship maintained  with the most absolute fidelity, constancy, and integrity?    8. _Laclius_. Now you are really using force. It makes no difference  what kind of force you use: force it is. For it is neither easy nor  right to refuse a wish of my sons-in-law, particularly when the wish is  a creditable one in itself.    Well, then, it has very often occurred to me when thinking about  friendship, that the chief point to be considered was this: is it  weakness and want of means that make friendship desired? I mean, is its  object an interchange of good offices, so that each may give that in  which he is strong, and receive that in which he is weak? Or is it not  rather true that, although this is an advantage naturally belonging to  friendship, yet its original cause is quite other, prior in time, more  noble in character, and springing more directly from our nature itself?  The Latin word for friendship--_amicitia_--is derived from that for  love--_amor_; and love is certainly the prime mover in contracting  mutual affection. For as to material advantages, it often happens  that those are obtained even by men who are courted by a mere show  of friendship and treated with respect from interested motives. But  friendship by its nature admits of no feigning, no pretence: as far  as it goes it is both genuine and spontaneous. Therefore I gather that  friendship springs from a natural impulse rather than a wish for help:  from an inclination of the heart, combined with a certain instinctive  feeling of love, rather than from a deliberate calculation of the  material advantage it was likely to confer. The strength of this  feeling you may notice in certain animals. They show such love to their  offspring for a certain period, and are so beloved by them, that they  clearly have a share in this natural, instinctive affection. But of  course it is more evident in the case of man: first, in the natural  affection between children and their parents, an affection which only  shocking wickedness can sunder; and next, when the passion of love has  attained to a like strength--on our finding, that is, some one person  with whose character and nature we are in full sympathy, because we  think that we perceive in him what I may call the beacon-light of  virtue. For nothing inspires love, nothing conciliates affection, like  virtue. Why, in a certain sense we may be said to feel affection even  for men we have never seen, owing to their honesty and virtue. Who, for  instance, fails to dwell on the memory of Gaius Fabricius and Manius  Curius with some affection and warmth of feeling, though he has never  seen them? Or who but loathes Tarquinius Superbus, Spurius Cassius,  Spurius Maelius? We have fought for empire in Italy with two great  generals, Pyrrhus and Hannibal. For the former, owing to his probity, we  entertain no great feelings of enmity: the latter, owing to his cruelty,  our country has detested and always will detest.    9. Now, if the attraction of probity is so great that we can love it not  only in those whom we have never seen, but, what is more, actually in an  enemy, we need not be surprised if men's affections are roused when they  fancy that they have seen virtue and goodness in those with whom a close  intimacy is possible. I do not deny that affection is strengthened by  the actual receipt of benefits, as well as by the perception of a wish  to render service, combined with a closer intercourse. When these are  added to the original impulse of the heart, to which I have alluded,  a quite surprising warmth of feeling springs up. And if any one thinks  that this comes from a sense of weakness, that each may have some one  to help him to his particular need, all I can say is that, when he  maintains it to be born of want and poverty, he allows to friendship an  origin very base, and a pedigree, if I may be allowed the expression,  far from noble. If this had been the case, a man's inclination to  friendship would be exactly in proportion to his low opinion of his own  resources. Whereas the truth is quite the other way. For when a man's  confidence in himself is greatest, when he is so fortified by virtue and  wisdom as to want nothing and to feel absolutely self-dependent, it  is then that he is most conspicuous for seeking out and keeping up  friendships. Did Africanus, for example, want anything of me? Not  the least in the world! Neither did I of him. In my case it was  an admiration of his virtue, in his an opinion, may be, which he  entertained of my character, that caused our affection. Closer intimacy  added to the warmth of our feelings. But though many great material  advantages did ensue, they were not the source from which our affection  proceeded. For as we are not beneficent and liberal with any view  of extorting gratitude, and do not regard an act of kindness as an  investment, but follow a natural inclination to liberality; so we look  on friendship as worth trying for, not because we are attracted to it by  the expectation of ulterior gain, but in the conviction that what it has  to give us is from first to last included in the feeling itself.    Far different is the view of those who, like brute beasts, refer  everything to sensual pleasure. And no wonder. Men who have degraded  all their powers of thought to an object so mean and contemptible can of  course raise their eyes to nothing lofty, to nothing grand and divine.  Such persons indeed let us leave out of the present question. And let  us accept the doctrine that the sensation of love and the warmth of  inclination have their origin in a spontaneous feeling which arises  directly the presence of probity is indicated. When once men have  conceived the inclination, they of course try to attach themselves to  the object of it, and move themselves nearer and nearer to him. Their  aim is that they may be on the same footing and the same level in regard  to affection, and be more inclined to do a good service than to ask a  return, and that there should be this noble rivalry between them.  Thus both truths will be established. We shall get the most important  material advantages from friendship; and its origin from a natural  impulse rather than from a sense of need will be at once more dignified  and more in accordance with fact. For if it were true that its material  advantages cemented friendship, it would be equally true that any change  in them would dissolve it. But nature being incapable of change, it  follows that genuine friendships are eternal.    So much for the origin of friendship. But perhaps you would not care to  hear any more.    _Fannius_. Nay, pray go on; let us have the rest, Laelius. I take on  myself to speak for my friend here as his senior.    _Scaevola_. Quite right! Therefore, pray let us hear.    10. _Loelius_. Well, then, my good friends, listen to some conversations  about friendship which very frequently passed between Scipio and myself.  I must begin by telling you, however, that he used to say that the most  difficult thing in the world was for a friendship to remain unimpaired  to the end of life. So many things might intervene: conflicting  interests; differences of opinion in politics; frequent changes in  character, owing sometimes to misfortunes, sometimes to advancing years.  He used to illustrate these facts from the analogy of boyhood, since  the warmest affections between boys are often laid aside with the boyish  toga; and even if they did manage to keep them up to adolescence, they  were sometimes broken by a rivalry in courtship, or for some other  advantage to which their mutual claims were not compatible. Even if the  friendship was prolonged beyond that time, yet it frequently received a  rude shock should the two happen to be competitors for office. For while  the most fatal blow to friendship in the majority of cases was the lust  of gold, in the case of the best men it was a rivalry for office and  reputation, by which it had often happened that the most violent enmity  had arisen between the closest friends.    Again, wide breaches and, for the most part, justifiable ones were  caused by an immoral request being made of friends, to pander to a man's  unholy desires or to assist him in inflicting a wrong. A refusal, though  perfectly right, is attacked by those to whom they refuse compliance  as a violation of the laws of friendship. Now the people who have no  scruples as to the requests they make to their friends, thereby allow  that they are ready to have no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28126"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, April, 1880 (#4)"],[1,"the earth and there find an abundant supply of the  all-necessary fluid. Endowed with rational ideas, pen in _hand_ he can  transmit them to his fellows far away, or to generations unborn. Heir and  lord of earth and ocean, his hands enable him to possess and control the  same, without which, notwithstanding all his reason, he could do neither,  but would have to crouch beneath the superior strength of the brute, and  fly for shelter to crags inaccessible to his beastly sovereign.    The only creature that has the reason to manage the world, has the  physical organization to do it. No _beast_ with man's reason could do  this, and no _man_ with the mere instinct of a brute could do it. How  marvellous, then this adaptation! How wondrous the adaptation of  everything, and how astonishing that any man, with all these things in  view, can for one moment forbear to admit a God. Let him try _a chance  experiment_. Let him take the letters of the alphabet and throw them about  promiscuously and then see how long ere they would move of their own  accord and arrange themselves into words and sentences. He may avail  himself of the whole benefit of his scheme; he may have the advantage of  an energy or power as a momentum to set them in motion; he may put these  letters into a box sufficiently large for the purpose, and then shake them  as long as may seem him good, and when, in this way, they shall have  become intelligible language, I will admit that he will have some reasons  for doubting a God. If this should seem too much like _artificial_ mind,  he may take some little animal, all constructed at his hands, and  dismember its limbs and dissect its body, and then within some vessel let  him throw its various parts at random, and seizing that vessel shake it  most lustily till bone shall come to bone, joint to joint, and the little  creature be restored to its original form. But if this could not be  accomplished by mere power, without wisdom to direct, how could the  original adjustment occur by chance? How could those very parts themselves  be _formed for_ adjustment one to another?    Mathematicians tell us wondrous things in relation to these hap-hazard  concerns. And they demonstrate their statements by what will not  lie--figures. Their rule is this: that, as one thing admits of but one  position, as, for example, _a_, so two things, _a_ and _b_, are capable of  two positions, as _ab_, _ba_. But if a third be added, instead of their  being susceptible of only one additional position, or three in all, they  are capable of six. For example, _abc_, _acb_, _bac_, _bca_, _cab_, _cba_.  Add another letter, _d_, and the four are capable of twenty-four positions  or variations. Thus we might go on. Merely adding another letter, _e_, and  so making _five_ instead of four, would increase the the number of  variations _five_-fold. They would then amount to one hundred and twenty.  A single additional letter, _f_, making _six_ in all, would increase this  last sum of one hundred and twenty _six_-fold, making seven hundred and  twenty. Add a _seventh_ letter, _g_, and the last-named sum would be  increased _seven_-fold, making the sum of five thousand and forty. If we  go on thus to the end of the alphabet, we have the astonishing sum of six  hundred and twenty thousand four hundred and forty-eight trillions, four  hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty-three billions, two  hundred and thirty-nine thousand four hundred and thirty-nine millions and  three hundred and sixty thousand!!! Hence it follows that, were the  letters of the alphabet to be thrown promiscuously into a vessel, to be  afterwards shaken into order by mere hap, their chance of being arranged,  not to say into words and sentences, but into their alphabetical order,  would be only as _one_ to the above number. All this, too, in the case of  only twenty-six letters! Take now the human frame, with its bones,  tendons, nerves, muscles, veins, arteries, ducts, glands, cartilages,  etc.; and having dissected the same, throw those parts into one  promiscuous mass; and how long, I ask, would it be ere Chance would put  them all into their appropriate places and form a perfect man? In this  calculation we are likewise to take into the account the chances of their  being placed bottom upwards, or side-ways, or wrong side out,  notwithstanding they might merely find their appropriate places. This  would increase the chances against a well-formed system to an amount  beyond all calculation or conception. In the case of the alphabet, the  chances for the letters to fall bottom up or aslant are not included. And  when we reflect that the blind goddess, or \"unintelligent forces,\" would  have to contend against such fearful odds in the case of a single  individual, how long are we to suppose it would be, ere from old Chaos she  could shake this mighty universe, with all its myriads upon myriads of  existences, into the glorious order and beauty in which it now exists.            AN ATHEIST IS A FOOL.      He can't believe that two letters can be adjusted to each other without  design, and yet he can believe all the foregoing incredibilities.    I might swell the list to a vast extent. I might bring into view the  verdure of the earth as being the most agreeable of all colors to the eye;  the general diffusion of the indispensibles and necessaries of life, such  as air, light, water, food, clothing, fuel, while less necessary things,  such as spices, gold, silver, tin, lead, zinc, are less diffused; also,  the infinite variety in things--in men, for instance--by which we can  distinguish one from another. But I forbear. Is it reasonable to conclude  that, where there are possible appearances of design, still no design is  there? or even that it is probable there is none?    I have said that there is as much evidence of purpose in the works of  nature as in those of art. I now say that there is more, _infinitely_  more. Should the wheels of nature stop their revolutions, and her energies  be palsied, and life and motion cease, even then would she exhibit  incomparably greater evidence of design, in her mere construction and  adaptation, than do the works of art. Shall we then be told that when she  is in full operation, and daily producing millions upon millions of  useful, of intelligent, of marvelous effects, she still manifests no marks  of intelligence! In nature we not only see all the works of art infinitely  exceeded, but we see, as it were, those works self-moved and performing  their operations without external agency. To use a faint comparison, we  see a factory in motion without water, wind or steam, its cotton placing  itself within the reach of the picker, the cards, the spinning-frame and  the loom, and turning out in rolls or cloth. Such virtually, nay, far more  wonderful, is the universe. Not a thousandth part so unreasonable would it  be to believe a real factory of this description, were one to exist, to be  a chance existence, as to believe this universe so. Sooner could I suppose  nature herself possessed of intelligence than admit the idea that there is  _no_ intelligence concerned in her organization and operations. There must  be a mind within or without her, or else we have no data by which to  distinguish mind. There must be a mind, or all the results of mind are  produced without any. There must be a mind, or chaos produces order, blind  power perfects effects, and non-intelligence the most admirable  correspondence and harmony imaginable. Skeptics pride themselves much on  their reason. They can't believe, they say, because it is unreasonable.  _What_ is unreasonable? To believe in a mind where there is every  appearance thereof that can be? Is it more reasonable to believe, then,  that every appearance of mind is produced without any mind at all?  Skeptics are the last men in all this wide world to pretend reason. They  doubt against infinite odds; they believe without evidence against  evidence, against demonstration, and then talk of reason!--_Origin  Bachelor's Correspondence with R. D. Owen._            BLUNDER ON AND BLUNDER ON--IT IS HUMAN TO BLUNDER.      Are all the mammoths one or two hundred thousand years old, as Sir Charles  Lyell conjectured? It was stated, in the bygone, that the \"diluvium\" was  very old, on account of the absence of human remains, but since man's  remains have been found there, it is inferred that man is very ancient;  whereas, the truth is, the mammoth is _very recent_. In many instances  their bones are so fresh that they contain twenty-seven per cent. of  animal substance; in some instances the flesh is still upon their bones,  with their last meal in their stomachs.    Mr. Boyd Dawkins has furnished us with a thrilling narrative of the  discovery of a mammoth in 1846, by Mr. Benkendorf, close to the mouth of  the Indigirka. This mammoth was disentombed during the great thaw of the  summer. The description is given in the following language: \"In 1846 there  was unusually warm weather in the north of Siberia. Already in May unusual  rains poured over the moors and bogs; storms shook the earth, and the  streams carried not only ice to the sea, but also large tracts of land. We  steamed on the first day up the Indigirka, but there were no thoughts of  land; we saw around us only a sea of dirty brown water, and knew the river  only by the rushing and roaring of the stream. The river rolled against us  trees, moss, and large masses of peat, so that it was only with great  trouble and danger that we could proceed. At the end of the second day we  were only a short distance up the stream; some one had to stand with the  sounding-rod in hand continually, and the boat received so many shocks  that it shuddered to the keel. A wooden vessel would have been smashed.  Around us we saw nothing but the flooded land.... The Indigirka, here, had  torn up the land and worn itself a fresh channel, and when the"]]]
