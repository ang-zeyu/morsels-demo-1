This is his occupation for the moment.    The doctor, what of him?  Doctor Jopper may be seen close to the water's  edge.  In his hand is a pewter flask, of the kind known as a \"pocket  pistol.\"  That pistol is loaded with brandy, and Dr Jopper is just in  the act of drawing part of the charge, which, with a slight admixture of  cool creek water, is carried aloft and poured into a very droughty  vessel.  The effect, however, is instantly apparent in the lively  twinkle of the doctor's round and prominent eyes.    Besancon is seated near the tent, and the old naturalist beside him.  The former is busy with the new plants he has collected.  A large  portfolio-looking book rests upon his knees, and between its leaves he  is depositing his stores in a scientific manner.  His companion, who  understands the business well, is kindly assisting him.  Their  conversation is interesting, but every one else is too busy with his  affairs to listen to it just now.    The guides are lounging about the waggon.  Old Ike fixes a new flint in  his rifle, and Redwood, of a more mirthful disposition, is occasionally  cracking a joke with Mike or the \"darkey.\"    Jake is still busy with his mules, and I with my favourite steed, whose  feet I have washed in the stream, and anointed with a little spare  grease.  I shall not always have the opportunity of being so kind to  him, but he will need it the less, as his hoofs become more hardened by  the journey.    Around the camp are strewed our saddles, bridles, blankets, weapons, and  utensils.  These will all be collected and stowed under cover before we  go to rest.  Such is a picture of our camp before supper.    When that meal is cooked, the scene somewhat changes.    The atmosphere, even at that season, was cool enough, and this, with  Mike's announcement that the coffee was ready, brought all the party--  guides as well--around the blazing pile of logs.  Each found his own  platter, knife, and cup; and, helping himself from the general stock,  set to eating on his own account.  Of course there were no fragments, as  a strict regard to economy was one of the laws of our camp.    Notwithstanding the fatigue, always incidental to a first day's march,  we enjoyed this _al fresco_ supper exceedingly.  The novelty had much to  do with our enjoyment of it, and also the fine appetites which we had  acquired since our luncheon at noon halt.    When supper was over, smoking followed, for there was not one of the  party who was not an inveterate burner of the \"noxious weed.\"  Some  chose cigars, of which we had brought a good stock, but several were  pipe-smokers.  The zoologist carried a meerschaum; the guides smoked out  of Indian calumets of the celebrated steatite, or red claystone.  Mike  had his dark-looking \"dudeen,\" and Jake his pipe of corn \"cob\" and  cane-joint shank.    Our English friend Thompson had a store of the finest Havannahs, which  he smoked with the grace peculiar to the English cigar smoker; holding  his cigar impaled upon the point of his knife-blade.  Kentucky also  smoked cigars, but his was half buried within his mouth, slanted  obliquely towards the right cheek.  Besancon preferred the paper  cigarette, which he made extempore, as he required them, out of a stock  of loose tobacco.  This is Creole fashion--now also the _mode de Paris_.    A song from the doctor enlivened the conversation, and certainly so  melodious a human voice had never echoed near the spot.  One and all  agreed that the grand opera had missed a capital \"first tenor\" in not  securing the services of our companion.    The fatigue of our long ride caused us to creep into our tents at an  early hour, and rolling ourselves in our blankets we went to sleep.  Of  course everything had been carefully gathered in lest rain might fall in  the night.  The trail-ropes of our animals were looked to: we did not  fear their being stolen, but horses on their first few days' journey are  easily \"stampeded,\" and will sometimes stray home again.  This would  have been a great misfortune, but most of us were old travellers, and  every caution was observed in securing against such a result.  There was  no guard kept, though we knew the time would come when that would be a  necessary duty.        CHAPTER THREE.    BESANCON'S ADVENTURE IN THE SWAMPS.    The prairie traveller never sleeps after daybreak.  He is usually astir  before that time.  He has many \"_chores_\" to perform, unknown to the  ordinary traveller who rests in the roadside inn.  He has to pack up his  tent and bed, cook his own breakfast, and saddle his horse.  All this  requires time, therefore an early start is necessary.    We were on our feet before the sun had shown his disc above the  black-jacks.  Lanty had the start of us, and had freshened up his fire.  Already the coffee-kettle was bubbling audibly, and the great frying-pan  perfumed the camp with an incense more agreeable than the odours of  Araby.    The raw air of the morning had brought everybody around the fire.  Thompson was pruning and cleansing his nails; the Kentuckian was cutting  a fresh \"chunk\" from his plug of \"James's River;\" the doctor had just  returned from the stream, where he had refreshed himself by a \"nip\" from  his pewter flask; Besancon was packing up his portfolios; the zoologist  was lighting his long pipe, and the \"Captain\" was looking to his  favourite horse, while inhaling the fragrance of an \"Havannah.\"  The  guides stood with their blankets hanging from their shoulders silent and  thoughtful.    In half an hour breakfast was over, the tents and utensils were restored  to the waggon, the horses were brought in and saddled, the mules  \"hitched up,\" and the expedition once more on its way.    This day we made not quite so good a journey.  The roads were heavier,  the country more thickly timbered, and the ground more hilly.  We had  several small streams to ford, and this retarded our progress.  Twenty  miles was the extent of our journey.    We encamped again without any of us having killed or seen game.  Although we had beaten the bushes on both sides of our course, nothing  bigger than the red-bird (scarlet tanager, _Pyranga rubra_), a screaming  jay, or an occasional flight of finches, gratified our sight.    We reached our camp somewhat disappointed.  Even old Ike and Redwood  came into camp without game, alleging also that they had not met with  the sign of a living quadruped.    Our second camp was also on the bank of a small stream.  Shortly after  our arrival on the ground, Thompson started out afoot, taking with him  his gun.  He had noticed a tract of marsh at no great distance off.  He  thought it promised well for snipe.    He had not been long gone, when two reports echoed back, and then  shortly after another and another.  He had found something to empty his  gun at.    Presently we saw him returning with a brace and a half of birds that  looked very much like large snipe.  So he thought them, but that  question was set at rest by the zoologist, who pronounced them at once  to be the American \"Curlew\" of Wilson (_Numenius longirostris_).  Curlew  or snipe, they were soon divested of the feathery coat, and placed in  Lanty's frying-pan.  Excellent eating they proved, having only the fault  that there was not enough of them.    These birds formed the topic of our after-supper conversation, and then  it generalised to the different species of wading birds of America, and  at length that singular creature, the \"ibis,\" became the theme.  This  came round by Besancon remarking that a species of ibis was brought by  the Indians to the markets of New Orleans, and sold there under the name  of \"Spanish Curlew.\"  This was the white ibis (_Tantalus albas_), which  the zoologist stated was found in plenty along the whole southern coast  of the United States.  There were two other species, he said, natives of  the warm parts of North America, the \"wood-ibis\" (_Tantalus loculator_),  which more nearly resembles the sacred ibis of Egypt, and the beautiful  \"sacred ibis\" (_Tantalus ruber_), which last is rarer than the others.    Our venerable companion, who had the ornithology of America, if I may  use the expression, at his fingers' ends, imparted many curious details  of the habits of these rare birds.  All listened with interest to his  statements--even the hunter-guides, for with all their apparent rudeness  of demeanour, there was a dash of the naturalist in these fellows.    When the zoologist became silent, the young Creole took up the  conversation.  Talking of the ibis, he said, reminded him of an  adventure he had met with while in pursuit of these birds among the  swamps of his native state.  He would relate it to us.  Of course we  were rejoiced at the proposal.  We were just the audience for an  \"adventure,\" and after rolling a fresh cigarette, the botanist began his  narration.    \"During one of my college vacations I made a botanical excursion to the  south-western part of Louisiana.  Before leaving home I had promised a  dear friend to bring him the skins of such rare birds as were known to  frequent the swampy region I was about to traverse, but he was  especially desirous I should obtain for him some specimens of the red  ibis, which he intended to have `mounted.'  I gave my word that no  opportunity should be lost of obtaining these birds, and I was very  anxious to make good my promise.    \"The southern part of the State of Louisiana is one vast labyrinth of  swamps, bayous, and lagoons.  The bayous are sluggish streams that glide  sleepily along, sometimes running one way, and sometimes the very  opposite, according to the season of the year.  Many of them are outlets  of the Mississippi, which begins to shed off its waters more than 300  miles from its mouth.  These bayous are deep, sometimes narrow,  sometimes wide, with islets in their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#4)"],[1,"young as she was she had to care for my mother and do all the  work of the household. To add to the misfortune, my father began  to drink heavily and was soon very dissipated; drinking and  gambling were his daily occupation. The interest and care of his  family were no longer a duty with him; he was seldom present to  cheer and comfort his lonely, afflicted wife.    The house was one mile from town, and we had no neighbors nearer  than that. The neglect and indifference on the part of my father  towards my afflicted mother served to increase her anguish and  sorrow, until death came to her relief. My mother's death left us  miserable indeed; we were (my sister and I) thrown upon the wide  world, helpless, and, I might say, without father or mother. My  father when free from the effects of intoxicating drink was a  kind-hearted, generous, noble man, but from that time forward he  was a slave to drink - seldom sober.    My aunt Charlotte was a spit-fire; she was married to a man by  the name of James Conner, a Kentuckian by birth. They lived ten  miles north of us. My sister went to live with her aunt, but the  treatment she received was so brutal that the citizens complained  to the county commissioners, and she was taken away from her aunt  and bound out to Dr. Fisher, with whose family she lived until  she became of age.    In the meantime the doctor moved to the city of Vandalia,  Illinois. I remained with my nurse until I was eight years of  age, when I was taken to my aunt Charlotte's to be educated. I  had been in a family which talked French so long that I had  nearly lost all knowledge of my mother tongue. The children at  school called me Gumbo, and teased me so much that I became  disgusted with the French language and tried to forget it - which  has been a disadvantage to me since that time.    My aunt was rich in her own right. My uncle Conner was poor; he  drank and gambled and wasted her fortune; she in return give him  blixen all the time. The more she scolded, the worse he acted,  until they would fight like cats and dogs. Between them I was  treated worse than an African slave. I lived in the family eight  years, and can safely say I got a whipping every day I was there.    My aunt was more like a savage than a civilized woman. In her  anger she generally took her revenge upon those around her who  were the least to blame. She would strike with anything she could  obtain with which to work an injury. I have been knocked down and  beaten by her until I was senseless, scores of times, and carry  many scars on my person, the result of harsh usage by her.    When I was sixteen years old I concluded to leave my aunt's house  - I cannot call it home; my friends advised me to do so. I walked  one night to Kaskaskia; went to Robert Morrison and told him my  story. He was a mail contractor. He clothed me comfortably, and  sent me over the Mississippi River into Missouri, to carry the  mail from St. Genevieve to Pinckney, on the north side of the  Missouri River, via Potosie, a distance of one hundred and  twenty-seven miles. It was a weekly mail. I was to receive seven  dollars a month for my services. This was in December, 1828. It  was a severe winter; snow unusually deep and roads bad. I was  often until two o'clock at night in reaching my stations. In the  following spring I came near losing my life on several occasions  when swimming the streams, which were then generally over their  banks. The Meramec was the worst stream I had to cross, but I  escaped danger, and gave satisfaction to my employer.    All I know of my father, after I was eight years of age, is that  he went to Texas in the year 1820, and I have never heard of him  since. What his fate was I never knew. When my mother died my  uncle and aunt Conner took all the property - a large tract of  land, several slaves, household and kitchen furniture, and all;  and, as I had no guardian, I never received any portion of the  property. The slaves were set free by an act of the Legislature;  the land was sold for taxes, and was hardly worth redeeming when  I came of age; so I sold my interest in all the land that had  belonged to my mother, and made a quit-claim deed of it to Sidney  Breeze, a lawyer of Kaskaskia, in consideration of two hundred  dollars. I was born on the point of land lying between and above  the mouth of the Okaw or Kaskaskia River and the Mississippi  River, in what is known as the Great American Bottom - the  particular point I refer to was then called Zeal-no-waw, the  Island of Nuts. It was nineteen miles from the point of the  bluffs to the mouth of the Okaw River; ten miles wide up at the  bluffs and tapering to a point where the rivers united. Large  bands of wild horses - French ponies, called \"punt\" horses - were  to be found any day feeding on the ever green and nutritious  grasses and vegetation. Cattle and hogs were also running wild in  great numbers; every kind of game, large and small, could be had  with little exertion. The streams were full of fish; the forests  contained many varieties of timber; nuts, berries, and wild  fruits of every description, found in the temperate zone could be  had in their season.    Near by was the Reservation of the Kaskaskia Indians, Louis  DuQuoin was chief of the tribe. He had a frame house painted in  bright colors, but he never would farm any, game being so  plentiful he had no need to labor. Nearly all the settlers were  French, and not very anxious for education or improvement of any  kind. I was quite a lad before I ever saw a wagon, carriage, set  of harness, or a ring, a staple, or set of bows to an ox yoke.  The first wagon I ever saw was brought into that country by a  Yankee peddler; his outfit created as great an excitement in the  settlement as the first locomotive did in Utah; the people  flocked in from every quarter to see the Yankee wagon.    Everything in use in that country was of the most simple and  primitive construction. There were no sawmills or gristmills in  that region; sawed lumber was not in the country. The wagons were  two-wheeled carts made entirely of wood - not a particle of iron  about them; the hubs were of white elm, spokes of white oak or  hickory, the felloes of black walnut, as it was soft and would  bear rounding. The felloes were made six inches thick, and were  strongly doweled together with seasoned hardwood pins; the linch  pin was of hickory or ash; the thills were wood; in fact all of  it was wood. The harness consisted of a corn husk collar, hames  cut from an ash tree root, or from an oak; tugs were rawhide;  the lines also were rawhide; a hackamore or halter was used in  place of a bridle; one horse was lashed between the thills by  rawhide straps and pins in the thills for a hold-back; when two  horses were used, the second horse was fastened ahead of the  first by straps fastened on to the thills of the cart. Oxen were  yoked as follows: A square stick of timber of sufficient length  was taken and hollowed out at the ends to fit on the neck of the  ox, close up to the horns, and this was fastened by rawhide  straps to the horns.    The people were of necessity self-sustaining, for they were  forced to depend upon their own resources for everything they  used. Clothing was made of home manufactured cloth or the skins  of wild animals. Imported articles were procured at heavy cost,  and but few found their way to our settlements. Steamboats and  railroads were then unthought of, by us at least, and the  navigation of the Mississippi was carried on in small boats that  could be drawn up along the river bank by means of oars, spikes,  poles, and hooks. The articles most in demand were axes, hoes,  cotton cards, hatchels for cleaning flax, hemp and cotton,  spinning wheels, knives, and ammunition, guns, and bar shears for  plows. In exchange for such goods the people traded beef, hides,  furs, tallow, beeswax, and honey. Money was not needed or used by  anyone - everything was trade and barter.    The people were generous and brave. Their pleasures and pastimes  were those usual in frontier settlements. They were hardy, and  well versed in woodcraft. They aided each other, and were all in  all a noble class of people, possessing many virtues and few  faults. The girls were educated by their mothers to work, and had  to work. It was then a disgrace for a young woman not to know how  to take the raw material - the flax and cotton - and, unaided,  manufacture her own clothing. It is a lamentable fact that such  is no longer the case.        CHAPTER II - LEE BEGINS A CAREER    I formed a liking for Emily Conner. Emily was an orphan, and  lived about four years at my aunt Charlotte's after her mother  died, and until her father married again. She had a consoling  word for me at all times when I was in trouble. From being  friends, we became lovers and were engaged to be married, when my  circumstances would permit. That winter I went to a school for  three months.    Early in the spring the Indian war known as the Black Hawk war  broke out, and volunteers were called for. I enrolled myself at  the first call, in the company of Capt. Jacob Feaman, of  Kaskaskia. The company was ordered to rendezvous at Fort  Armstrong, Rock Island, where the troops were reorganized, and  Capt. Feaman was promoted to colonel, and James Conner became  captain of the company. I served until the end of the war, and  was engaged in many skirmishes, and lastly was at the battle of  Bad Axe, which I think took place on the 4th day of August, A. D.  1831, but am not certain as to the date.    The soldiers were allowed to go home about the 1st of September,  1831. Our company got to Kaskaskia, and were discharged, I think,  on the 1st of September, 1831. I got back with a broken-down  horse and worn-out clothing, and without money. I concluded to  seek a more genial clime, one where I could more rapidly better  my financial condition. I went to see and"]]]
