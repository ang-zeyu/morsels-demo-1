It may be as well here, at this point, as elsewhere, once for all, to  dispose of a large portion of the matter contained in the long article  in the _North American Review_, now under consideration. In preparing  any work, particularly in the department of history, it is to be  presumed that the explorations of the writer extend far beyond what he  may conclude to put into his book. He will find much that is of no  account whatever; that would load down his narrative, swell it to  inadmissible dimensions, and shed no additional light. Collateral and  incidental questions cannot be pursued in details. A new law, however,  is now given out, that must be followed, hereafter, by all writers--that  is, to give not a catalogue merely, but an account of the contents, of  every book and tract they have read. It is thus announced by our  Reviewer: \"We assume Mr. Upham has not seen this tract, as he neither  mentioned it nor made use of its material.\"    The document here spoken of was designed to give Increase Mather's ideas  on the subject of witchcraft trials, written near the close of those in  Salem, in 1692. As I had no peculiar interest in determining what his  views were--as a careful study of the tract, particularly taken in  connection with its _Postscript_, fails to bring any reader to a clear  conception of them; and as its whole matter was altogether immaterial to  my subject--I did not think it worth while to encumber my pages with it.  So in respect to many other points, in treating which extended  discussions might be demanded. If I had been governed by such notions as  the Reviewer seems to entertain, my book, which he complains of as too  long, would have been lengthened to the dimensions of a cyclopaedia of  theology, biography, and philosophy. For keeping to my subject, and not  diverting attention to writings of no inherent value, in any point of  view, and which would contribute nothing to the elucidation of my  topics, I am charged by this Reviewer, in the baldest terms, with  ignorance, on almost every one of his sixty odd pages, and, often,  several times on the same page.    All that I say of Cotton Mather, mostly drawn from his own words, does  not cover a dozen pages. Exception is taken to some unfavorable  judgments, cursorily expressed. This is fair and legitimate, and would  justify my being called on to substantiate them. But to assume, and  proclaim, that I had not read nor seen tracts or volumes that would come  under consideration in such a discussion, is as rash as it is offensive;  and, besides, constitutes a charge against which no person of any self  respect or common sense can be expected to defend himself. I gave the  opinion of Cotton Mather's agency in the Witchcraft of 1692, to which my  judgment had been led--whether with sufficient grounds or not will be  seen, as I proceed--but did not branch off from my proper subject, into  a detail of the sources from which that opinion was derived. If I had  done so, in connection with allusions to Mather, upon the same principle  it would have been necessary to do it, whenever an opinion was expressed  of others, such as Roger Williams, or Hugh Peters, or Richard Baxter. It  would destroy the interest, and stretch interminably the dimensions, of  any book, to break its narrative, abandon its proper subject, and stray  aside into such endless collateral matter. But it must be done, if the  article in the _North American Review_, is to be regarded as an  authoritative announcement of a canon of criticism. Lecturers and public  speakers, or writers of any kind, must be on their guard. If they should  chance, for instance, to speak of Cotton Mather as a pedant, they will  have the reviewers after them, belaboring them with the charge of \"a  great lack of research,\" in not having \"pored over\" the \"prodigious\"  manuscript of his unpublished work, in the Library of the Massachusetts  Historical Society, the whole of his three hundred and eighty-two  printed works, and the huge mass of _Mather Papers_, in the Library of  the American Antiquarian Society; and with never having \"read\" the  _Memorable Providences_, or \"seen\" the _Wonders of the Invisible World_,  or \"heard\" of the _Magnalia Christi Americana_.          III.    COTTON MATHER AND THE GOODWIN CHILDREN. JOHN BAILY. JOHN HALE. GOODWIN'S  CERTIFICATES. MATHER'S IDEA OF WITCHCRAFT AS A WAR WITH THE DEVIL. HIS  USE OF PRAYER. CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CASE OF THE GOODWIN CHILDREN AND  SALEM WITCHCRAFT.      The Reviewer complains of my manner of treating Cotton Mather's  connection with the affair of the Goodwin children. The facts in the  case are, that the family, to which they belonged, lived in the South  part of Boston. The father, a mason by occupation, was, as Mather  informs us, \"a sober and pious man.\" As his church relations were with  the congregation in Charlestown, of which Charles Morton was the Pastor,  he probably had no particular acquaintance with the Boston Ministers.  From a statement made by Mr. Goodwin, some years subsequently, it seems  that after one of his children had, for \"about a quarter of a year, been  laboring under sad circumstances from the invisible world,\" he called  upon \"the four Ministers of Boston, together with his own Pastor, to  keep a day of prayer at his house. If so deliverance might be obtained.\"  He says that Cotton Mather, with whom he had no previous acquaintance,  was the last of the Ministers that \"he spoke to on that occasion.\" Mr.  Mather did not attend the meeting, but visited the house in the morning  of the day, before the other Ministers came; spent a half hour there;  and prayed with the family. About three months after, the Ministers held  another prayer-meeting there, Mr. Mather being present. He further  stated that Mr. Mather never, in any way, suggested his prosecuting the  old Irish woman for bewitching his children, nor gave him any advice in  reference to the legal proceedings against her; but that \"the motion of  going to the authority was made to him by a Minister of a neighboring  town, now departed.\"    The Reviewer, in a note to the last item, given above, of Goodwin's  statement, says: \"Probably Mr. John Baily.\" Unless he has some  particular evidence, tending to fix this advice upon Baily, the  conjecture is objectionable. The name of such a man as Baily appears to  have been, ought not, unnecessarily, to be connected with the  transaction. It is true that, after the family had become relieved of  its \"sad circumstances from the invisible world,\" Mr. Baily took one of  the children to his house, in Watertown; but that is no indication of  his having given such advice. The only facts known of him, in connection  with Witchcraft prosecutions, look in the opposite direction. When John  Proctor, in his extremity of danger, sought for help, Mr. Baily was one  of the Ministers from whom alone he had any ground to indulge a hope for  sympathy; and his name is among the fourteen who signed the paper  approving of Increase Mather's _Cases of Conscience_. The list comprises  all the Ministers known as having shown any friendly feelings towards  persons charged with Witchcraft or who had suffered from the  prosecutions, such as Hubbard, Allen, Willard, Capen and Wise; but not  one who had taken an active part in hurrying on the proceedings of 1692.    If any surmise is justifiable, or worth while, as to the author of the  advice to Goodwin--and perhaps it is due to the memory of Baily, whose  name has been thus introduced--I should be inclined to suggest that it  was John Hale, of Beverly, who, like Baily, was deceased at the date of  Goodwin's certificate. He was a Charlestown man, originally of the same  religious Society with Goodwin, and had kept up acquaintance with his  former townsmen. His course at Salem Village, a few years afterwards,  shows that he would have been likely to give such advice; and we may  impute it to him without any wrong to his character or reputation. His  noble conduct in daring, in the very hour of the extremest fury of the  storm, when, as just before the break of day, the darkness was deepest,  to denounce the proceedings as wrong; and in doing all that he could to  repair that wrong, by writing a book condemning the very things in which  he had himself been a chief actor, gives to his name a glory that cannot  be dimmed by supposing that, in the period of his former delusion, he  was the unfortunate adviser of Goodwin.    When Calef's book reached this country, in 1700, a Committee of seven  was raised, at a meeting of the members of the Parish of which the  Mathers were Ministers, to protect them against its effects. John  Goodwin was a member of it, and contributed the Certificate from which  extracts have just been made. It was so worded as to give the impression  that Cotton Mather did not take a leading part in the case of Goodwin's  children, in 1688. It states, as has been seen, that he \"was the last of  the Ministers\" asked to attend the prayer-meeting; but lets out the fact  that he was the first to present himself, going to the house and praying  with the family before the rest arrived. Goodwin further states, as  follows: \"The Ministers would, now and then, come to visit my distressed  family, and pray with and for them, among which Mr. Cotton Mather would,  now and then, come.\" The whole document is so framed as to present  Mather as playing a secondary part.    In an account, however, of the affair, written by this same John"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#4)"],[1,"that you  were supposed to soak it in water before tackling it in earnest, but as  the only supply (except the runlet they still carried on them) was in  the fresh-water canal behind our unshaken line, such a course was not  practicable; the discovery of a very dead Turk some days later in that  canal led to the ribald suggestion that he had rashly endeavoured to eat  his ration. Our scientist laid great stress on its extraordinary  nutritive properties, but desisted, after breaking a tooth off his  denture, in actual experiment.    German influence, too, was apparent in the relations between officers  and men. A Turkish _yuzbashi_ was asked to get a big batch of prisoners  to form two groups according to the languages they spoke--Arabic or  Turkish. It was not an easy task in the open on a pitch-black night, but  he did it with soldierly promptitude and flung his glowing cigarette end  in the face of a dilatory private. As a natural corollary it may be  mentioned here that one or two of our prisoners had deserted after  shooting officers who had struck them.    For some days after the battles of Serapeum and Toussoum we expected  another attempt, but they had been more heavily mauled than we thought  at first. The dead in the Canal were kept down by the weight of their  ammunition for some time, and the shifting sand on the Sinaitic side  was always revealing hastily-buried corpses on their line of retreat.    Jemal Pasha hurried back to Gaza and published a grandiloquent report  for Moslem consumption, to the effect that the Turks were already in  Cairo (as was indeed the case with many hundreds), and that, of the  _giaour_ fleet, one ship had sunk, one had been set on fire, and the  rest had fled. Two heavy howitzers, as a matter of fact, had managed by  indirect fire from a concealed position to land a couple of projectiles  on the \"Hardinge,\" which was not originally built for such rough  treatment, being an Indian marine vessel taken over by the Navy. She  gave more than she got when her four-point-sevens found the massed  Turkish supports.    A great deal of criticism has been flung at this first series of fights  on the Canal, mostly by Anglo-Egyptian civilians. They asked derisively  whether we were protecting the Canal or the Canal us. The answer is in  the affirmative to both questions. Ordinary steamer traffic was only  suspended for a day during the first onslaught, and the G.O.C. was not  such a fool as to leave the Canal in his rear and forgo the defensive  advantage. There are some who, in their military ardour, would have had  him pursue the enemy into the desert, forgetting that to leave a sound  position and pursue a superior force on an ever-widening front in a  barren country which they know better than you do and have furnished  with their own supply-bases is just asking for trouble. Our few  aeroplanes in those days could only reconnoitre twenty miles out, and  there was no evidence that the enemy had not merely fallen back to his  line of wells preparatory to another attempt. We had not then the men,  material, or resources for a triumphant advance into Sinai; it was  enough to make sure of keeping the enemy that side of the Canal with the  Senussi sitting on the fence and Egypt honeycombed with seditious  propaganda.    Anyone at all in touch with native life in Cairo could gauge the extent  of propagandist activity by gossip at cafes and in the bazars. The  Senussi was marching against us. India was in revolt and the Indian Army  on the Canal had joined the Turks. The crowning stroke of ingenuity was  a tale that received wide credence among quite intelligent Egyptians. It  was to the effect that the Turks had commandeered an enormous number of  camels and empty kerosene tins. This was quite true so far, but the yarn  then rose to the following flight of fancy: These empty tins were to be  filled with dry cement and loaded on camels, which were to be marched  without water for days until they reached the Canal, when the pangs of  thirst would compel them to rush madly into the water. The cement would  solidify and the Faithful would march across on a composite bridge of  camel and concrete. Our flotilla was to be penned in by similar means.    There must be something about a Turk that hypnotises an Egyptian. His  country has suffered appallingly under Ottoman rule, and a pure-blooded  Turk can seldom be decently civil to him and considers him almost  beneath contempt. This is the conquering Tartar pose that has earned the  Turk such detestation and final ruin in Arabia, but it seems to have  fascinated the Egyptian like a rabbit in the presence of a python. Quite  early in the Turkish invasion of Sinai a detachment of Egyptian camelry,  operating in conjunction with the Bikanirs, deserted _en masse_ to the  enemy. It was at first supposed that they had been captured, but we  afterwards heard of their being feted somewhere in Palestine. On the  other hand, an Egyptian battery did yeoman service on the Canal; I saw a  pontoon that looked like a carelessly opened sardine-tin as a result of  its attentions.    The most tragic aspect of this spurious and mischievous propaganda was  its victims from Indian regiments. The Indian Moslem as a rule has no  illusions about the Turks, and will fight them at sight, but there will  always be a few misguided bigots to whom a specious and dogmatic  argument will appeal. There is no occasion to dwell on these cases,  which were sporadic only and generally soon met with the fate incurred  by attempted desertion to the enemy.    We looked on the movement as an insidious and dangerous disease and did  our best to trace it to its source and stop the distributing channels.  After events on the Canal had simmered down, I was seconded to Cairo to  help tackle the movement there: to show how little hold it had over the  minds of thinking Moslems. I may mention that my colleague was a Pathan  major who was a very strict Moslem and a first-rate fellow to boot.    We both served under an Anglo-Indian major belonging to the C.I.D., one  of the most active little men I have ever met. There were also several  \"ferrets,\" or Intelligence agents, who came into close contact with the  \"suspects\" and could be trusted up to a certain point if you looked  sharply after them. This is as much as can be said for any of these men,  though some are better, and some worse, than others. On the Canal we  employed numbers of them to keep us informed of the enemy's movements  and used to check them with the aerial reconnaissance--they needed it.  It did not take us long to find out that these sophisticated Sinaites  had established an Intelligence bureau of their own. They used to meet  their \"opposite numbers\" employed by the enemy at pre-arranged spots  between the lines and swop information, thereby avoiding unnecessary  toil or risk (the Sinaitic Bedouin loathes both) and obtaining news of  interest for both sides. It was a magnificently simple scheme; its sole  flaw was in failing to realise that some of us had played the Great Game  before. We used to time our emissaries to their return and cross-check  them where their wanderings intersected those of others--all were  supposed to be trackers and one or two knew something about it. Of  course they were searched and researched on crossing and returning to  our outpost line, for they could not be trusted to refuse messages to or  from the Turks. It was among this coterie that the brilliant idea  originated of shaving a messenger's head, writing a despatch on his  scalp, and then letting his hair grow before he started to deliver it. I  doubt if any of our folk were thorough enough for this, but we tested  for it occasionally, and an unpleasant job it was. Generally they would  incur suspicion by their too speedy return and the nonchalant way in  which they imparted tidings which would have driven them into ecstasies  of self-appreciation had they obtained such by legitimate methods. Then  a purposely false bit of information calculated to cause certain  definite action on the other side would usually betray them. Some  purists suggested a firing party as a fitting end for these gambits, but  that would have been a waste. Such men have their uses, until they know  they are suspected, as valuable channels of misinformation. No doubt the  enemy knew this too, and that is how an Intelligence Officer earns his  pay, by sifting grain from chaff as it comes in and sending out empty  husks and mouldy news.    But to return to Cairo. We netted a good deal of small fry, but only  landed one big fish during the time I was attached. He was a  Mesopotamian and a very respectable old gentleman, who followed the  calling of astrologer and peripatetic quack--a common combination and  admirably adapted for distributing propaganda. He came from Stamboul  through Athens with exemplary credentials, and might have got through to  India, which was the landfall he proposed to make, if his propagandist  energy had not led him to deviate on a small side-tour in Egypt. Here  we got on his track, and I boarded the Port Said express at short notice  while he and the \"ferret\" who had picked him up got into a third-class  compartment lower down. As the agent made no signal after the train had  pulled out, I knew our man had not got the bulk of his propaganda with  him, otherwise I had powers to hold up the express, for it was more  important to get his stuff than the man himself. At Port Said he had a  chance of seeing me, thanks to the agent's clumsiness, and I had to  shave my beard off and buy a sun-helmet in consequence, for I was  travelling in the same ship along the Canal to see that he did not  communicate with troops on either side of the bank, and on the slightest  suspicion he would have put his stuff over the side. All went smoothly  and he was arrested in Suez roads by plain-clothes men with a sackful of  seditious literature for printing"]]]
