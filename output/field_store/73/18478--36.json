Could assistance be at  hand?    Breathlessly the Bushman stood listening.        CHAPTER FIVE.    AREND LOST.    In the afternoon, when Groot Willem, Hans, and Hendrik returned to the  camp, they found it deserted.    Several jackals reluctantly skulked off as they drew near and on riding  up to the spot from which those creatures had retired, they saw the  clean-picked bones of an antelope.  The camp must have been deserted for  several hours.    \"What does this mean?\" exclaimed Groot Willem.  \"What has become of  Arend?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Hendrik.  \"It is strange Swart and Cong are not  here to tell us.\"    Something unusual had certainly happened; yet, as each glanced anxiously  around the place, there appeared nothing to explain the mystery.    \"What shall we do?\" asked Willem, in a tone that expressed much concern.    \"Wait,\" answered Hans; \"we can do nothing more.\"    Two or three objects were at this moment observed which fixed their  attention.  They were out on the plain, nearly a mile off.  They  appeared to be horses,--their own pack animals,--and Hendrik and Groot  Willem started off towards them to drive them back to the camp.    They were absent nearly an hour before they succeeded in turning the  horses and driving them towards the camp.  As they passed near the drift  on their return, they rode towards the river to water the animals they  were riding.    On approaching the bank, several native dogs, that had been yelling in a  clump, were seen to scatter and retreat across the plain.  The horsemen  thought little of this, but rode on into the river, and permitted their  horses to drink.    While quietly seated in their saddles, Hendrik fancied he heard some  strange sounds.  \"Listen!\" said he.  \"I hear something queer.  What is  it?\"    \"One of the honden,\" answered Willem.    \"Where?\"    This question neither for a moment could answer, until Groot Willem  observed one of the pits from the edge of which the dogs appeared to  have retreated.    \"Yonder's a pit-trap!\" he exclaimed, \"and I believe there's a dog has  got into it.  Well, I shall give it a shot, and put the creature out of  its misery.\"    \"Do so,\" replied Hendrik.  \"I hate the creatures as much as any other  noxious vermin, but it would be cruel to let one starve to death in that  way.  Kill it.\"    Willem rode up to the pit and dismounted.  Neither of them, as yet,  spoke loud enough to be heard in the pits, and the two men down below  were at this time silent, the dog alone continuing its cries of agony.    The only thing Willem saw on gazing down the hole was the wild hound  still hanging on the stake; and taking aim at one of its eyes he fired.    The last spark of life was knocked out of the suffering animal; but the  report of the great gun was instantly followed by two yells more hideous  than were ever uttered by \"wild honden.\"    They were the screams of two frightened Africans,--each frightened to  think that the next bullet would be for him.    \"Arend!\" exclaimed Willem, anxious about his brother, and thinking only  of him.  \"Arend! is it you?\"    \"No, Baas Willem,\" answered the Kaffir.  \"It is Congo.\"    Through the opening, Willem reached down the butt-end of his long roer,  while firmly clasping it by the barrel.    The Kaffir took hold with both hands, and, by the strong arms of Groot  Willem, was instantly extricated from his subterranean prison.    Swartboy was next hauled out, and the two mud-bedaubed individuals stood  gazing at one another, each highly delighted at the rueful appearance  presented by his rival.    Slowly the fire of anger, that seemed to have all the while been burning  in the Kaffir's eyes, became extinguished, and broad smile broke like  the light of day over his stoical countenance.    He had been released at length, and was now convinced that no one was to  blame for his protracted imprisonment.    Swartboy had been punished for his ill-timed mirth, and Congo was  willing to forget and forgive.    \"But where is Arend?\" asked Willem, who could not forget, even while  amused by the ludicrous aspect of the two Africans, that his brother was  missing.    \"Don't know, Baas Willem,\" answered Congo.  \"I been long time here.\"    \"But when did you see him last?\" inquired Hendrik.    Congo was unable to tell, for he seemed under the impression that he had  been several days in the bosom of the earth.    From Swartboy they learnt that soon after their own departure Arend had  started in pursuit of one of the horses seen straying over the plain.  That was the last Swart had seen of him.    The sun was now low down, and, without wasting time in idle speech,  Hendrik and Groot Willem again mounted their horses, and rode off  towards the place where Arend was last seen.    They reached the edge of the timber nearly a mile from the camp, and  then, not knowing which way to turn, or what else to do, Willem fired a  shot.    The loud crack of the roer seemed to echo far-away through the forest,  and anxiously they listened for some response to the sound.  It came,  but not in the report of a rifle, or in the voice of the missing man,  but in the language of the forest denizens.  The screaming of vultures,  the chattering of baboons, and the roaring of lions were the responses  which the signal received.    \"What shall we do, Willem?\" asked Hendrik.    \"Go back to the halting-place and bring Congo and Spoor'em,\" answered  Willem, as he turned towards the camp, and rode off, followed by his  cousin.        CHAPTER SIX.    SPOOR'EM.    The last ray of daylight had fled from the valley of the Limpopo, when  Willem and Hendrik, provided with a torch and accompanied by the Kaffir  and the dog Spoor'em, again set forth to seek for their lost companion.    The animal answering to the name Spoor'em was a large Spanish  bloodhound, now led forth to perform the first duty required of him in  the expedition.    The dog, when quite young, had been brought from one of the Portuguese  settlements at the north,--purchased by Groot Willem and christened  Spoor'em by Congo.    In the long journey from Graaf Reinet, this brute had been the cause of  more trouble than all the other dogs of the pack.  It had shown a strong  disinclination to endure hunger, thirst, or the fatigues of the journey;  and had often exhibited a desire to leave its new masters.    Spoor'em was now led out, in hopes that he would do some service to  compensate for the trouble he had caused.    Taking a course along the edge of the forest, that would bring them  across the track made by Arend in reaching the place where the horse had  strayed, the spoor of Arend's horse as well as the other's was  discovered.    The tracks of both were followed into the forest, along well-beaten  path, evidently made by buffaloes and other animals passing to and from  the river.  This path was hedged in by a thick thorny scrub, which being  impenetrable rendered it unnecessary for some time to avail themselves  of the instincts of the hound.  Congo led the way.    \"Are you sure that the two horses have passed along here?\" asked Willem,  addressing himself to the Kaffir.    \"Yaas, Baas Willem,\" answered Congo.  \"Sure dey both go here.\"    Willem, turning to Hendrik, added, \"I wish Arend had let the horse go to  the deuce.  It was not worth following into a place like this.\"    After continuing through the thicket for nearly half a mile, they  reached a stretch of open ground, where there was no longer a beaten  trail, but tracks diverging in several directions.  The hoof-marks of  Arend's horse were again found, and the bloodhound was unleashed and set  upon them.    Unlike most hounds, Spoor'em did not dash onward, leaving his followers  far behind.  He appeared to think that it would be for the mutual  advantage of himself and his masters that they should remain near each  other.  The latter, therefore, had no difficulty in keeping up with the  dog.    Believing that they should soon learn something of the fate of their  lost companion, they proceeded onward, with their voices encouraging the  hound to greater speed.    The sounds of a contest carried on by some of the wild denizens of the  neighbourhood were soon heard a few yards in advance of them.  They were  sounds that the hunters had often listened to before, and therefore  could easily interpret.  A lion and a pack of hyenas were quarrelling  over the dead body of some large animal.  They were not fighting; for of  course the royal beast was in undisputed possession of the carcass, and  the hyenas were simply complaining in their own peculiar tones.  The  angry roars of the lion, and the hideous laughter of the hyenas,  proceeded from a spot only a few yards in advance, and in the direction  Spoor'em was leading them.    The moon had risen, and by its light the searchers soon beheld the  creatures that were causing the tumult.  About a dozen hyenas were  gibbering around a huge lion that lay crouched alongside a dark object  on the ground, upon which he appeared to be feeding.  As the hunters  drew nearer, the hyenas retreated to some distance.    \"It appears to be the carcass of a horse,\" whispered Hendrik.    \"Yes, I am sure of it,\" answered Willem, \"for I can see the saddle.  My  God!  It is Arend's horse!  Where is he?\"    Spoor'em had now advanced to within fifteen paces of where the lion lay,  and commenced baying a menace; as if commanding the lion to forsake his  unfinished repast.  An angry growl was all the answer Spoor'em could  obtain; and the lion lay still.    \"We must either kill or drive him away,\" said Willem.  \"Which shall we  try?\"    \"Kill him,\" answered Hendrik; \"that will be our safest plan.\"    Stealing out of their saddles, Willem and Hendrik gave their horses in  charge to the Kaffir, and then proceeded to stalk.  With their guns at  full cock they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#4)"],[1,"pain, will never be written; and probably it is as well that it  should not be. But I can give you a few of the facts, if you care to  hear them. The Beaver soon found that he was out of the otter's reach,  and with his fears relieved on that point he set to work to free himself  from the trap. Round and round he twisted, till there came a little  snap, and the bone of his arm broke short off in the steel jaws. Then  for a long, long time he pulled and pulled with all his might, and at  last the tough skin was rent apart, and the muscles and sinews were torn  out by the roots. His right hand was gone, and he was so weak and faint  that it seemed as if all the strength and life of his whole body had  gone with it. No matter. He was free, and he swam away to the nearest  burrow and lay down to rest. The otter tried to do the same, but he was  caught by the thick of his thigh, and his case was a hopeless one. Next  day the trapper found him alive, but very meek and quiet, worn out with  fear and useless struggles. In the other trap were a beaver's hand and  some long shreds of flesh and sinew that must once have reached well up  into the shoulder.    We shall have to hurry over the events of the next winter--the last  winter in the city's history. By the time the Beaver's wound was  healed--Nature was good to him, and the skin soon grew over the torn  stump--the pond was covered with ice. The beavers, only half as numerous  as they had been a few weeks before, kept close in their lodges and  burrows, and for a time they lived in peace and quiet, and their numbers  suffered no further diminution. Then the trapper took to setting his  traps through the ice, and before long matters were worse than ever. By  spring the few beavers that remained were so thoroughly frightened that  the ancient town was again abandoned--this time forever. The lodges fell  to ruins, the burrows caved in, the dam gave way, the pond and canals  were drained, and that was the end of the city.    Yet not quite the end, after all. The beavers have vanished from their  old habitation, but their work remains in the broad meadows cleared of  timber by their teeth, and covered with rich black soil by the  inundations from their dam. There is an Indian legend which says that  after the Creator separated the land from the water He employed gigantic  beavers to smooth it down and prepare it for the abode of men. However  that may be, the farmers of generations to come will have reason to rise  up and bless those busy little citizens--but I don't suppose they will  ever do it.    One city was gone, but there were two that could claim the honor of  being our Beaver's home at different periods of his life. The first, as  we have already seen, was ancient and historic. The second was  brand-new. Let us see how it had its beginning. The Beaver got married  about the time he left his old home; and this, by the way, is a very  good thing to do when you want to start a new town. Except for his  missing hand, his wife was so like him that it would have puzzled you to  tell which was which. I think it is very likely that she was his twin  sister, but of course that's none of our business. Do you want to know  what they looked like? They measured about three feet six inches from  tip of nose to tip of tail, and they weighed perhaps thirty pounds  apiece. Their bodies were heavy and clumsy, and were covered with thick,  soft, grayish under-fur, which in turn was overlaid with longer hairs of  a glistening chestnut-brown, making a coat that was thoroughly  water-proof as well as very beautiful. Their heads were somewhat like  those of gigantic rats, with small, light-brown eyes, little round ears  covered with hair, and long orange-colored incisors looking out from  between parted lips. One portrait will answer for both of them.    They wandered about for some time, looking for a suitable location, and  examining several spots along the beds of various little rivers, none of  which seemed to be just right. But at last they found, in the very heart  of the wilderness, a place where a shallow stream ran over a hard stony  bottom, and here they set to work. It was a very desirable situation in  every respect. At one side stood a large tree, so close that it could  probably be used as a buttress for the dam when the latter was  sufficiently lengthened to reach it; while above the shallow the ground  was low and flat on both sides for some distance back from the banks, so  that the pond would have plenty of room to spread out. If they could  have spoken they would probably have said that the place was a dam site  better than any other they had seen.    [Illustration: _Building the Dam._]    Alder bushes laid lengthwise of the current were the first materials  used, and for a time the water filtered through them with hardly a  pause. Then the beavers began laying mud and stones and moss on this  brush foundation, scooping them up with their hands, and holding them  under their chins as they waddled or swam to the dam. The Beaver himself  was not very good at this sort of work, for his right hand was gone, as  we know, and it was not easy for him to carry things; but he did the  best he could, and together they accomplished a great deal. The mud and  the grass and such-like materials were deposited mainly on the upper  face of the dam, where the pressure of the water only sufficed to drive  them tighter in among the brush; and thus, little by little, a smooth  bank of earth was presented to the current, backed up on the lower side  by a tangle of sticks and poles. Its top was very level and straight,  and along its whole length the water trickled over in a succession of  tiny rills. This was important, for if all the overflow had been in one  place the stream might have been so strong and rapid as to eat into  the dam, and perhaps carry away the whole structure.    The first year the beavers did not try to raise the stream more than a  foot above its original level. There was much other work to be done--a  house to be built, and food to be laid in for the winter--and if they  spent too much time on the dam they might freeze or starve before  spring. A few rods up-stream was a grassy point which the rising waters  had transformed into an island, and here they built their lodge, a  hollow mound of sticks and mud, with a small, cave-like chamber in the  centre, from which two tunnels led out under the pond--\"angles,\" the  trappers call them. The walls were masses of earth and wood and stones,  so thick and solid that even a man with an axe would have found it  difficult to penetrate them. Only at the very apex of the mound there  was no mud, nothing but tangled sticks through which a breath of fresh  air found its way now and then. In spite of this feeble attempt at  ventilation I am obliged to admit that the atmosphere of the lodge was  often a good deal like that of the Black Hole of Calcutta, but beavers  are so constituted that they do not need much oxygen, and they did not  seem to mind it. In all other respects the house was neat and clean.  The floor was only two or three inches above the level of the water in  the angles, and would naturally have been a bed of mud; but they mixed  little twigs with it, and stamped and pounded it down till it was hard  and smooth. I think likely the Beaver's tail had something to do with  this part of the work, as well as with finishing off the dam, for he was  fond of slapping things with it, and it was just the right shape for  such use. In fact, I fear that if it had not been for the tail, and for  other tails like it, neither of the cities would ever have been as  complete as they were. With the ends of projecting sticks cut off to  leave the walls even and regular, and with long grass carried in to make  the beds, the lodge was finished and ready.    And now you might have seen the beavers coming home to rest after a  night's labor at felling timber--swimming across the pond toward the  island, with only the tops of their two little heads showing above the  water. In front of the lodge each tail-rudder gives a slap and a twist,  and they dive for the submarine door of one of the angles. In another  second they are swimming along the dark, narrow tunnel, making the water  surge around them. Suddenly the roof of the passage rises, and their  heads pop up into the air. A yard or two farther, and they enter the  chamber of the lodge, with its level floor and its low, arched roof. And  there in the darkness they lie down on their grass beds and go to sleep.  It is good to have a home of your own where you may take your ease when  the night's work is done.    Near the upper end of the pond, where the bank was higher, they dug a  long burrow, running back ten or fifteen feet into the ground. This was  to be the last resort if, by any possibility, the lodge should ever be  invaded. It was a weary task, digging that burrow, for its mouth was  deep under the water, and every few minutes they had to stop work and  come to the surface for breath. Night after night they scooped and  shovelled, rushing the job as fast as they knew how, but making pretty  slow progress in spite of all their efforts. It was done at last,  however, and they felt easier in their minds when they knew that it was  ready for use in case of necessity. From its mouth in the depths of the  pond it sloped gradually upward to a dry chamber under the roots of a  large birch; and here, where a few tiny holes were not likely to be  noticed from the outside, two or three small openings, almost hidden by  the moss and dead leaves, let in the air and an occasional ray of  light. The big tree made a solid roof overhead, and the chamber was  large enough, with a little crowding, to accommodate a whole family of  beavers.    There was only one other heavy task, and that was the gathering of the  wood, which, with its bark, was to serve as food through the winter.  This too "]]]
