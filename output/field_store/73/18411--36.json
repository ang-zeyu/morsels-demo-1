They proved to be a mother bear and her  two cubs; but the cubs were nearly as large as their mother. They ran  eagerly to the fire, drew out the part of the flesh that remained  unburned, and ate it greedily. The crew threw great lumps of the flesh  upon the ice, and the old bear carried them away, one by one, laying a  lump before each of her cubs, as she brought it, and thus dividing it,  keeping only a small share for herself. As she was carrying off the last  piece, the sailors shot both the cubs dead and wounded the mother, but  not fatally. It would have touched the heart of all but the most  unfeeling had they seen the affectionate concern of this poor animal in  the dying moments of her young. Though terribly wounded herself, she  crawled to the place where they lay, carrying a lump of flesh with her.  She tore the lump in pieces, and laid it before them. When she saw that  they refused to eat, she laid her paws first upon one, then upon the  other, and tried to raise them up, moaning meanwhile most pitifully.  Finding she could not stir them, she went off, and when she had gone  some distance, looked back and moaned, and called them. As that did not  seem to entice them away, she crawled back, and smelling round them,  began to lick their wounds. She went off a second time a few paces,  looked behind her again, and for some time stood moaning and calling. As  the cubs did not rise to follow her, she returned once more, and with  signs of inexpressible fondness went round them, caressing them with her  paws. Finding at last that they were cold and lifeless, she raised her  head toward the ship, and growled a curse upon their murderers, which  they returned with a volley of musket balls. She fell between her cubs,  and died licking their wounds.    [Illustration]          XXI    A STRANGE MOUSER      A gentleman once owned a hen that was a fine mouser. She was seen  constantly watching close to a corn rick, and the moment a mouse  appeared, she seized it in her beak, and carried it to a meadow near by,  where she would play with it like a young cat for some time, and then  kill it. She has been known to catch four or five mice a day in this  manner.    [Illustration]          XXII    SABINUS AND HIS DOG      After the execution of Sabinus, the Roman general, who was put to death  because of his attachment to the family of Germanicus, his body was left  lying unburied upon the precipice of the Gemoniae, as a warning to all  who should dare to befriend the house of Germanicus. No friend had the  courage to go near the body; one only remained true--his faithful dog.  For three days the animal continued to watch the body, his mournful  howling awakening the sympathy of every heart. Food was brought to him,  and he was kindly coaxed to eat it; but on taking the bread, instead of  eating it himself, he fondly laid it on his master's mouth and renewed  his howling. Days thus passed, but not for a single moment did he leave  the body.    The body was at length thrown into the Tiber, and the loving creature,  still unwilling that it should perish, leaped into the water after it,  and clasping the corpse between its paws, vainly tried to keep it from  sinking.    [Illustration]          XXIII    A JUST RETALIATION      A tame elephant kept by a merchant was allowed to go at large. The  animal used to walk about the streets in as quiet and familiar a manner  as any of the people, and took great pleasure in visiting the shops,  especially those which sold herbs and fruit, where he was well received,  except by a couple of brutal cobblers, who, without any cause, took  offense at the generous creature, and once or twice tried to wound his  trunk with their awls. The noble animal, who knew it was beneath him to  crush them, did not hesitate to punish them by other means. He filled  his large trunk with water, not of the cleanest quality, and advancing  to them, as usual, covered them all at once with the very dirty flood.  The fools were laughed at, and the punishment applauded.    [Illustration: A Just Retaliation.--Page 48]    [Illustration]          XXIV    AN ODD FAMILY      A gentleman travelling through Mecklenburg relates the following curious  incident which happened at an inn at which he was staying. After dinner,  the landlord placed on the floor a large dish of soup, and then gave a  loud whistle. At once there came into the room a mastiff, a fine Angora  cat, an old raven, and a remarkably large rat, with a bell about its  neck. These four animals went to the dish, and without disturbing one  another, fed together. After they had eaten, the dog, cat, and rat lay  before the fire, and the raven hopped about the room.          XXV    THE DOLPHIN      In the reign of Augustus Caesar there was, in the Lucrine lake, a dolphin  which formed a most romantic attachment to the son of a poor man. The  boy had to go every day from Baiae to Puteoli to school, and such were  the friendly terms on which he had got with the dolphin, that he had  only to wait by the banks of the lake and cry, \"Simo, Simo\"--the name he  had given to the animal, when, lo! Simo came scudding to the shore, let  fall the sharp prickles of his skin, and gently offered his back for the  boy to mount upon. The boy, nothing afraid, used to mount at once, and  the dolphin, without either rein or spur, would speed across the sea to  Puteoli, and after landing the young scholar, wait about the shore till  it was time for the boy to go home, when it would again perform the same  sort of friendly service. The boy was not ungrateful for such great  kindness, and used every day to bring a good store of food for Simo,  which the animal would take from his hand in the most tame and kindly  manner imaginable. For several years this friendly intercourse was kept  up. It was, in fact, only ended by the death of the boy. As the story  goes, the dolphin felt so badly when the lad failed to come as usual,  that it threw itself on the shore, and died, as was thought, of very  grief and sorrow at the loss of its friend.    [Illustration]          XXVI    A GOOD FINDER      One day a tradesman, walking with a friend, offered to wager that if he  were to hide a five-shilling piece in the dust, his dog would find it  and bring it to him. The wager was accepted, and the piece of money  marked and hidden. When the two had gone on some distance, the tradesman  called to his dog that he had lost something, and told him to seek it.  The dog turned back at once, and his master and his friend went on their  way. Meanwhile a traveller, driving a small chaise, saw the piece of  money which his horse had kicked from its hiding-place, alighted, took  it up and drove to his inn. The dog had just reached the spot in search  of the lost piece, when the stranger picked it up. He followed the  chaise, went into the inn, and, having scented the coin in the pocket of  the traveller, he kept leaping up at him. Supposing him to be some dog  that had lost his master, the traveller took these actions as marks of  affection, and as the animal was handsome, decided to keep him. He gave  him a good supper, and on retiring, took him with him to his room. But  no sooner had he pulled off his trousers than they were seized by the  dog. The owner, thinking that the dog only wanted to play with them,  took them away. The animal began to bark at the door, which the  traveller opened, thinking the animal wanted to go out. The dog  snatched up the trousers, and away he went, the traveller, with his  nightcap on, posting after him. The dog ran full speed to his master's  house, followed by the stranger, who accused the dog of robbing him.  \"Sir,\" said the master, \"my dog is a very faithful creature; and if he  ran away with your trousers, it is because you have in them money which  does not belong to you.\" The traveller became still more angry. \"Keep  calm, sir,\" answered the other, smiling; \"no doubt there is in your  purse a five-shilling piece which you picked up in the road, and which I  hid, knowing my dog would bring it back. This was the reason for the  robbery which he committed upon you.\" The stranger said he had found  such a coin, gave it up to the man, and went on his way. But the clever  dog had thus proven himself to be a good finder.    [Illustration]          XXVIII    REVENGE      A wild stork was brought by a farmer into his poultry yard, to be the  companion of a tame one, which he had long kept there; but the tame  stork, disliking a rival, fell upon the poor, wild stranger, and beat  him so terribly that he took wing and flew off.    About four months afterwards, however, his injuries having all healed,  he returned to the poultry yard, with three other storks, who no sooner  alighted than they all together fell upon the tame stork, and killed  it.    [Illustration]          XXVIII    MICE AS SAILORS      Although there are few who would dispute the cleverness and sagacity of  the larger animals, it is doubtful if there are many who credit the  mouse with even average intelligence. The following instance may go far  to raise our humble friend in the popular estimation; more especially as  the story is told by one who really saw the whole performance. In a  country where berries are scarce, these little animals were obliged to  cross a river to make their forages. In returning with their booty to  their homes, they had to recross the stream; in doing which they showed  an ingenuity little short of marvelous. The party, which consisted of  five, selected a water-lily leaf, on which they placed their berries in  a heap in the middle; then, by their united force, they brought it to  the water's edge, and after launching it, jumped on it, and placed  themselves round the heap, with their heads joined over it, and their  backs to the water. In this manner they drifted down the stream until  they reached the opposite shore, when they unloaded their cargo,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25447"],[0,"Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays (#4)"],[1,", not instinct itself,  that reason aims at correcting.    These more or less trite maxims may be illustrated by application to  Bergson's advocacy of \"intuition\" as against \"intellect.\" There are,  he says, \"two profoundly different ways of knowing a thing. The first  implies that we move round the object: the second that we enter into  it. The first depends on the point of view at which we are placed and  on the symbols by which we express ourselves. The second neither  depends on a point of view nor relies on any symbol. The first kind of  knowledge may be said to stop at the _relative_; the second, in those  cases where it is possible, to attain the _absolute_.\"[4] The second  of these, which is intuition, is, he says, \"the kind of _intellectual  sympathy_ by which one places oneself within an object in order to  coincide with what is unique in it and therefore inexpressible\" (p.  6). In illustration, he mentions self-knowledge: \"there is one  reality, at least, which we all seize from within, by intuition and  not by simple analysis. It is our own personality in its flowing  through time--our self which endures\" (p. 8). The rest of Bergson's  philosophy consists in reporting, through the imperfect medium of  words, the knowledge gained by intuition, and the consequent complete  condemnation of all the pretended knowledge derived from science and  common sense.    This procedure, since it takes sides in a conflict of instinctive  beliefs, stands in need of justification by proving the greater  trustworthiness of the beliefs on one side than of those on the other.  Bergson attempts this justification in two ways, first by explaining  that intellect is a purely practical faculty to secure biological  success, secondly by mentioning remarkable feats of instinct in  animals and by pointing out characteristics of the world which, though  intuition can apprehend them, are baffling to intellect as he  interprets it.    Of Bergson's theory that intellect is a purely practical faculty,  developed in the struggle for survival, and not a source of true  beliefs, we may say, first, that it is only through intellect that we  know of the struggle for survival and of the biological ancestry of  man: if the intellect is misleading, the whole of this merely inferred  history is presumably untrue. If, on the other hand, we agree with him  in thinking that evolution took place as Darwin believed, then it is  not only intellect, but all our faculties, that have been developed  under the stress of practical utility. Intuition is seen at its best  where it is directly useful, for example in regard to other people's  characters and dispositions. Bergson apparently holds that capacity  for this kind of knowledge is less explicable by the struggle for  existence than, for example, capacity for pure mathematics. Yet the  savage deceived by false friendship is likely to pay for his mistake  with his life; whereas even in the most civilised societies men are  not put to death for mathematical incompetence. All the most striking  of his instances of intuition in animals have a very direct survival  value. The fact is, of course, that both intuition and intellect have  been developed because they are useful, and that, speaking broadly,  they are useful when they give truth and become harmful when they give  falsehood. Intellect, in civilised man, like artistic capacity, has  occasionally been developed beyond the point where it is useful to the  individual; intuition, on the other hand, seems on the whole to  diminish as civilisation increases. It is greater, as a rule, in  children than in adults, in the uneducated than in the educated.  Probably in dogs it exceeds anything to be found in human beings. But  those who see in these facts a recommendation of intuition ought to  return to running wild in the woods, dyeing themselves with woad and  living on hips and haws.    Let us next examine whether intuition possesses any such infallibility  as Bergson claims for it. The best instance of it, according to him,  is our acquaintance with ourselves; yet self-knowledge is proverbially  rare and difficult. Most men, for example, have in their nature  meannesses, vanities, and envies of which they are quite unconscious,  though even their best friends can perceive them without any  difficulty. It is true that intuition has a convincingness which is  lacking to intellect: while it is present, it is almost impossible to  doubt its truth. But if it should appear, on examination, to be at  least as fallible as intellect, its greater subjective certainty  becomes a demerit, making it only the more irresistibly deceptive.  Apart from self-knowledge, one of the most notable examples of  intuition is the knowledge people believe themselves to possess of  those with whom they are in love: the wall between different  personalities seems to become transparent, and people think they see  into another soul as into their own. Yet deception in such cases is  constantly practised with success; and even where there is no  intentional deception, experience gradually proves, as a rule, that  the supposed insight was illusory, and that the slower more groping  methods of the intellect are in the long run more reliable.    Bergson maintains that intellect can only deal with things in so far  as they resemble what has been experienced in the past, while  intuition has the power of apprehending the uniqueness and novelty  that always belong to each fresh moment. That there is something  unique and new at every moment, is certainly true; it is also true  that this cannot be fully expressed by means of intellectual concepts.  Only direct acquaintance can give knowledge of what is unique and new.  But direct acquaintance of this kind is given fully in sensation, and  does not require, so far as I can see, any special faculty of  intuition for its apprehension. It is neither intellect nor intuition,  but sensation, that supplies new data; but when the data are new in  any remarkable manner, intellect is much more capable of dealing with  them than intuition would be. The hen with a brood of ducklings no  doubt has intuition which seems to place her inside them, and not  merely to know them analytically; but when the ducklings take to the  water, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be illusory, and the  hen is left helpless on the shore. Intuition, in fact, is an aspect  and development of instinct, and, like all instinct, is admirable in  those customary surroundings which have moulded the habits of the  animal in question, but totally incompetent as soon as the  surroundings are changed in a way which demands some non-habitual mode  of action.    The theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of  philosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals,  or to savages, or even to most civilised men. It is hardly to be  supposed, therefore, that the rapid, rough and ready methods of  instinct or intuition will find in this field a favourable ground for  their application. It is the older kinds of activity, which bring out  our kinship with remote generations of animal and semi-human  ancestors, that show intuition at its best. In such matters as  self-preservation and love, intuition will act sometimes (though not  always) with a swiftness and precision which are astonishing to the  critical intellect. But philosophy is not one of the pursuits which  illustrate our affinity with the past: it is a highly refined, highly  civilised pursuit, demanding, for its success, a certain liberation  from the life of instinct, and even, at times, a certain aloofness  from all mundane hopes and fears. It is not in philosophy, therefore,  that we can hope to see intuition at its best. On the contrary, since  the true objects of philosophy, and the habit of thought demanded for  their apprehension, are strange, unusual, and remote, it is here, more  almost than anywhere else, that intellect proves superior to  intuition, and that quick unanalysed convictions are least deserving  of uncritical acceptance.    In advocating the scientific restraint and balance, as against the  self-assertion of a confident reliance upon intuition, we are only  urging, in the sphere of knowledge, that largeness of contemplation,  that impersonal disinterestedness, and that freedom from practical  preoccupations which have been inculcated by all the great religions  of the world. Thus our conclusion, however it may conflict with the  explicit beliefs of many mystics, is, in essence, not contrary to the  spirit which inspires those beliefs, but rather the outcome of this  very spirit as applied in the realm of thought.      II. UNITY AND PLURALITY    One of the most convincing aspects of the mystic illumination is the  apparent revelation of the oneness of all things, giving rise to  pantheism in religion and to monism in philosophy. An elaborate logic,  beginning with Parmenides, and culminating in Hegel and his followers,  has been gradually developed, to prove that the universe is one  indivisible Whole, and that what seem to be its parts, if considered  as substantial and self-existing, are mere illusion. The conception  of a Reality quite other than the world of appearance, a reality one,  indivisible, and unchanging, was introduced into Western philosophy by  Parmenides, not, nominally at least, for mystical or religious  reasons, but on the basis of a logical argument as to the  impossibility of not-being, and most subsequent metaphysical systems  are the outcome of this fundamental idea.    The logic used in defence of mysticism seems to be faulty as logic,  and open to technical criticisms, which I have explained elsewhere. I  shall not here repeat these criticisms, since they are lengthy and  difficult, but shall instead attempt an analysis of the state of mind  from which mystical logic has arisen.    Belief in a reality quite different from what appears to the"]]]
