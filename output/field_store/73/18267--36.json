ORIGINS      The origins of painting in China are mingled with the origins of writing.  Written characters are, in fact, derived from pictography or picture  writing, those in use at the present time being only developed and  conventionalized forms of primitive drawings. The early books and  dictionaries give us definite information regarding this evolution. But  while history bears witness to this ancient connection, we do not come  into contact with actual evidence until the third century of our era,  through the bas-reliefs of the Han dynasty, and in the fourth century  through the paintings of Ku K'ai-chih. Here we find by no means the origin  of an evolution but, on the contrary, the last traces of an expiring  tradition.          II. BEFORE THE INTERVENTION OF BUDDHISM      The bas-reliefs of the Han dynasty are almost all comprised in the  sculptured stone slabs embellishing mortuary chambers and of these the  artistic merit is most unequal.[4] Their technique is primitive. It  consists in making the contours of figures by cutting away the stone in  grooves with softened angles, leaving the figure in silhouette. Engraved  lines complete the drawing.    The subjects are sometimes mythical and sometimes legendary. There are  representations of divinities, fabulous animals, scenes of war and of the  chase and processions of people bearing tribute. At times the great  compositions display imposing spectacles, a luxurious and refined array.  Now and then attempts at pictorial perspective are joined to some  unrelated scene.    All this is in direct conflict with the technique of bas-reliefs and leads  to the surmise that the models were drawn by painters and copied with  more or less skill by makers of funeral monuments.      [4] These bas-reliefs have been studied by M. Chavannes in \"La    sculpture sur pierre en Chine au temps des deux dynasties Han,\" Paris,    1893; also in \"Mission archeologique en Chine,\" Paris, 1910. Rubbings    taken from the sculptured slabs are reproduced here in full.      [Illustration: PLATE VI. PAINTING BY AN UNKNOWN ARTIST    T'ang Period. Collection of R. Petrucci.]    This impression is confirmed if certain carved slabs are compared with a  painting by Ku K'ai-chih, of which we can judge by means of a copy made in  the Sung period.[5] One of the scenes of this long scroll leaves no  possible misapprehension as to the pictorial origin of the Han  bas-reliefs. Its subject, a river god on a chariot drawn by dragons, is  similar in composition to the models used by the artisans of the third  century.    We have, however, better testimony than a copy made at a later period. The  British Museum, in London, is the owner of a painting attributed to Ku  K'ai-chih. The reasons impelling us to believe in its authenticity are  weighty, almost indisputable.[6][B] We therefore accept it here and will  endeavor to define the work of one of the greatest painters of China in  the fourth and the beginning of the fifth century.      [5] This painting formed part of the collection of the ex-viceroy Tuan    Fang, killed in 1911, during the revolution. It was published in 1911    by the Japanese archeologist, Mr. Taki.      [6] These reasons are set forth in a work which Mr. Laurence Binyon is    preparing, to accompany a reproduction engraved by Japanese artists    for the British Museum.      [B] The preceding footnote refers to a work published in 1913 by the    Trustees of the British Museum, containing a reproduction of the    painting in its entirety and giving a full description.--TRANSLATOR.    The painted scenes are inspired by a work of the third century containing  admonitions addressed to the ladies of the imperial palace. The striking  characteristics of these compositions are the lightness and delicacy of  style, the poetry of the attitudes and the supreme elegance of the forms.  Heavy black tresses frame the ivory faces with refined and subtle charm.  The voluptuous caprice of garments in long floating folds, the extreme  perfection of the figures and the grace of gestures make this painting a  thing of unique beauty. Only through the cultivation of centuries could  such spiritual insight be attained.    If the copy from the collection of Tuan Fang recalls the bas-reliefs of  the Han period, the painting in the British Museum is related to the  bas-reliefs of Long-men, which date from the seventh century and of which  M. Chavannes has published photographs. Therefore we may say that the  style of Ku K'ai-chih exemplifies the distinctive features of Chinese  painting at a period extending from the third to the seventh centuries.[7]      [7] A copy of an engraving on stone of the year 1095, representing    \"Confucius sitting amidst his disciples\" and another representing    \"Confucius walking, followed by one of his disciples,\" dated 1118,    have been published by M. de Chavannes (\"Mission archeologique en    Chine,\" Nos. 869 and 871). The latter is considered as having been    undoubtedly executed after a painting by Ku K'ai-chih.    It should also be noted that toward the end of the fifth or the beginning  of the sixth century, the painter and critic Hsieh Ho formulated the  Six Canons[8] upon which the far-eastern code of Aesthetics is founded.  These Canons introduce philosophical conceptions and technical knowledge  which also presuppose long cultivation, for it is only after rules have  been brought to reality in a work of art that they are formulated into a  code. Therefore when Buddhism appeared in China it found there a native  art whose value was proved beyond question by a long succession of  masterpieces. After having exhausted every manifestation of strength and  vigor, this art had arrived at expressions of extreme refinement and  profound and appealing charm, closely verging on the disquieting dreams of  decadence.      [8] Interpretations of the Six Canons by five authorities are    accessible in a very convenient form for comparison in Mr. Laurence    Binyon's \"Flight of the Dragon,\" p. 12.--TRANSLATOR.      [Illustration: PLATE VII. GEESE    Sung Period. British Museum, London.]          III. THE INTERVENTION OF BUDDHISM      Chinese books state that between the fourth and the eighth centuries \"the  art of painting _man and things_ underwent a vital change.\" By this they  alluded to the intervention of Buddhist art, which made its appearance in  China toward the fifth century in the form of the Graeco-Indian art of  Gandhara, already modified by its transit across Eastern Turkestan. This  by no means indicates that purely Indian origins might not be found for  it. At Sanchi, as well as in Central India and at Ajanta such  characteristics are preserved. But the Greek dynasties which had settled  in northwestern India in the train of Alexander, had carried with them the  canons of Hellenistic art. The technique and methods of this art were  placed at the service of the new religion. They gave to Buddhist  art--which was just beginning to appear in the Gandharian provinces--its  outward form, its type of figures, its range of personages and the greater  part of its ornamentation.[9]      [9] See Foucher, \"L'Art greco-bouddique du Gandhara.\" Paris, Leroux.    Buddhism found the expiring Hellenistic formula which had been swept  beyond its borders, ready at hand at the very moment the new religion was  gathering itself together for that prodigious journey which, traversing  the entire Far East, was to lead it to the shores of the Pacific. Once  outside of India, it came into contact with Sassanian Persia and Bactria.  With Hellenistic influences were mingled confused elements springing from  the scattered civilizations which had reigned over the Near East. Thence  it spread to the byways of Eastern Turkestan.    We know today, thanks to excavations of the German expeditions of  Gruenwedel and von Lecoq, the two English expeditions of Sir Aurel Stein  and the French expedition of M. Pelliot, that in that long chain of oases  filled with busy cities, Buddhist art was gradually formed into the  likeness under which it was to appear as a finished product in the Far  East. Here it developed magnificently. The enormous frescoes of Murtuq  display imposing arrangements of those figures of Buddhas and Bodhisatvas  which were to remain unchanged in the plastic formulas of China and Japan.  Meanwhile conflicting influences continued to be felt. Sometimes the  Indian types prevailed, as at Khotan, at others there were Semitic types  and elements originating in Asia Minor, such as were found at Miran, and  at length, as at Tun-huang, types that were almost entirely Chinese  appeared.    The paintings brought from Tun-huang by the Stein and Pelliot expeditions  enable us to realize the nature of the characteristics which contact with  China imposed upon Buddhist art. It had no choice but to combine with the  tendencies revealed in the painting of Ku K'ai-chih. The painter trained  in the school of Hellenistic technique drew with the brush. He delighted  in the rhythmic movement of the line and the display of a transcendent  harmony and elegance of proportion such as are seen in the frescoes of  Eastern Turkestan. Perhaps through contact with China--herself searching  for new expressions--but probably through a combination of the two  influences, Buddhist painting, at the opening of the T'ang dynasty, gives  us heavier types in which compact and powerful figures take on a new  character.    From then on we perceive the nature of the great change to which the early  books refer. Chinese painting had already known the genii and fairies of  Taoism, the Rishi or wizards living in mountain solitudes, the Immortals  dwelling in distant isles beyond the sea. It now knew gods wrapped in the  ecstatic contemplation of Nirvana, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/223"],[0,"The Wisdom of Father Brown (#4)"],[1," professional conjurer, as well as juggler, ventriloquist, and expert in  the rope trick. The conjuring explains the hat. It is without traces  of hair, not because it is worn by the prematurely bald Mr Glass, but  because it has never been worn by anybody. The juggling explains the  three glasses, which Todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and  catch in rotation. But, being only at the stage of practice, he smashed  one glass against the ceiling. And the juggling also explains the sword,  which it was Mr Todhunter's professional pride and duty to swallow.  But, again, being at the stage of practice, he very slightly grazed the  inside of his throat with the weapon. Hence he has a wound inside him,  which I am sure (from the expression on his face) is not a serious  one. He was also practising the trick of a release from ropes, like the  Davenport Brothers, and he was just about to free himself when we all  burst into the room. The cards, of course, are for card tricks, and they  are scattered on the floor because he had just been practising one of  those dodges of sending them flying through the air. He merely kept his  trade secret, because he had to keep his tricks secret, like any other  conjurer. But the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once  looked in at his back window, and been driven away by him with great  indignation, was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance, and  make us imagine his whole life overshadowed by the silk-hatted spectre  of Mr Glass.\"    \"But what about the two voices?\" asked Maggie, staring.    \"Have you never heard a ventriloquist?\" asked Father Brown. \"Don't you  know they speak first in their natural voice, and then answer themselves  in just that shrill, squeaky, unnatural voice that you heard?\"    There was a long silence, and Dr Hood regarded the little man who  had spoken with a dark and attentive smile. \"You are certainly a very  ingenious person,\" he said; \"it could not have been done better in a  book. But there is just one part of Mr Glass you have not succeeded in  explaining away, and that is his name. Miss MacNab distinctly heard him  so addressed by Mr Todhunter.\"    The Rev. Mr Brown broke into a rather childish giggle. \"Well, that,\"  he said, \"that's the silliest part of the whole silly story. When our  juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn, he counted  them aloud as he caught them, and also commented aloud when he failed to  catch them. What he really said was: 'One, two and three--missed a glass  one, two--missed a glass.' And so on.\"    There was a second of stillness in the room, and then everyone with  one accord burst out laughing. As they did so the figure in the corner  complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall with a flourish.  Then, advancing into the middle of the room with a bow, he produced  from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red, which announced that  ZALADIN, the World's Greatest Conjurer, Contortionist, Ventriloquist and  Human Kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of Tricks  at the Empire Pavilion, Scarborough, on Monday next at eight o'clock  precisely.            TWO. -- The Paradise of Thieves      THE great Muscari, most original of the young Tuscan poets,  walked swiftly into his favourite restaurant, which overlooked the  Mediterranean, was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon and  orange trees. Waiters in white aprons were already laying out on white  tables the insignia of an early and elegant lunch; and this seemed to  increase a satisfaction that already touched the top of swagger. Muscari  had an eagle nose like Dante; his hair and neckerchief were dark and  flowing; he carried a black cloak, and might almost have carried a black  mask, so much did he bear with him a sort of Venetian melodrama. He  acted as if a troubadour had still a definite social office, like a  bishop. He went as near as his century permitted to walking the world  literally like Don Juan, with rapier and guitar.    For he never travelled without a case of swords, with which he had  fought many brilliant duels, or without a corresponding case for his  mandolin, with which he had actually serenaded Miss Ethel Harrogate, the  highly conventional daughter of a Yorkshire banker on a holiday. Yet he  was neither a charlatan nor a child; but a hot, logical Latin who liked  a certain thing and was it. His poetry was as straightforward as anyone  else's prose. He desired fame or wine or the beauty of women with  a torrid directness inconceivable among the cloudy ideals or cloudy  compromises of the north; to vaguer races his intensity smelt of danger  or even crime. Like fire or the sea, he was too simple to be trusted.    The banker and his beautiful English daughter were staying at the hotel  attached to Muscari's restaurant; that was why it was his favourite  restaurant. A glance flashed around the room told him at once, however,  that the English party had not descended. The restaurant was glittering,  but still comparatively empty. Two priests were talking at a table in  a corner, but Muscari (an ardent Catholic) took no more notice of them  than of a couple of crows. But from a yet farther seat, partly concealed  behind a dwarf tree golden with oranges, there rose and advanced towards  the poet a person whose costume was the most aggressively opposite to  his own.    This figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check, with a pink tie, a  sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots. He contrived, in the  true tradition of 'Arry at Margate, to look at once startling and  commonplace. But as the Cockney apparition drew nearer, Muscari was  astounded to observe that the head was distinctly different from the  body. It was an Italian head: fuzzy, swarthy and very vivacious, that  rose abruptly out of the standing collar like cardboard and the comic  pink tie. In fact it was a head he knew. He recognized it, above all  the dire erection of English holiday array, as the face of an old but  forgotten friend name Ezza. This youth had been a prodigy at college,  and European fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen; but when  he appeared in the world he failed, first publicly as a dramatist and a  demagogue, and then privately for years on end as an actor, a traveller,  a commission agent or a journalist. Muscari had known him last behind  the footlights; he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that  profession, and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed  him up.    \"Ezza!\" cried the poet, rising and shaking hands in a pleasant  astonishment. \"Well, I've seen you in many costumes in the green room;  but I never expected to see you dressed up as an Englishman.\"    \"This,\" answered Ezza gravely, \"is not the costume of an Englishman, but  of the Italian of the future.\"    \"In that case,\" remarked Muscari, \"I confess I prefer the Italian of the  past.\"    \"That is your old mistake, Muscari,\" said the man in tweeds, shaking  his head; \"and the mistake of Italy. In the sixteenth century we Tuscans  made the morning: we had the newest steel, the newest carving, the  newest chemistry. Why should we not now have the newest factories, the  newest motors, the newest finance--the newest clothes?\"    \"Because they are not worth having,\" answered Muscari. \"You cannot make  Italians really progressive; they are too intelligent. Men who see the  short cut to good living will never go by the new elaborate roads.\"    \"Well, to me Marconi, or D'Annunzio, is the star of Italy\" said the  other. \"That is why I have become a Futurist--and a courier.\"    \"A courier!\" cried Muscari, laughing. \"Is that the last of your list of  trades? And whom are you conducting?\"    \"Oh, a man of the name of Harrogate, and his family, I believe.\"    \"Not the banker in this hotel?\" inquired the poet, with some eagerness.    \"That's the man,\" answered the courier.    \"Does it pay well?\" asked the troubadour innocently.    \"It will pay me,\" said Ezza, with a very enigmatic smile. \"But I am a  rather curious sort of courier.\" Then, as if changing the subject, he  said abruptly: \"He has a daughter--and a son.\"    \"The daughter is divine,\" affirmed Muscari, \"the father and son are, I  suppose, human. But granted his harmless qualities doesn't that banker  strike you as a splendid instance of my argument? Harrogate has millions  in his safes, and I have--the hole in my pocket. But you daren't  say--you can't say--that he's cleverer than I, or bolder than I, or even  more energetic. He's not clever, he's got eyes like blue buttons; he's  not energetic, he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic. He's a  conscientious, kindly old blockhead; but he's got money simply because  he collects money, as a boy collects stamps. You're too strong-minded  for business, Ezza. You won't get on. To be clever enough to get all  that money, one must be stupid enough to want it.\"    \"I'm stupid enough for that,\" said Ezza gloomily. \"But I should suggest  a suspension of your critique of the banker, for here he comes.\"    Mr Harrogate, the great financier, did indeed enter the room, but nobody  looked at him. He was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eye and  faded grey-sandy moustaches; but for his heavy stoop he might have been  a colonel. He carried several unopened letters in his hand. His son  Frank was a really fine lad, curly-haired, sun-burnt and strenuous; but  nobody looked at him either. All eyes, as usual, were riveted, for  the moment at least, upon Ethel Harrogate, whose golden Greek head and  colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea, like  a goddess's. The poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking  something, as indeed he was. He was drinking the Classic; which his  fathers made. Ezza studied her with a gaze equally intense and far more  baffling.    Miss Harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this  occasion; and her family had fallen into"]]]
