Summer, a direct descendant of Svasud  (the mild and lovely), inherited his sire's gentle disposition, and  was loved by all except Winter, his deadly enemy, the son of Vindsual,  himself a son of the disagreeable god Vasud, the personification of  the icy wind.          \"Vindsual is the name of him      Who begat the winter's god;      Summer from Suasuthur sprang:      Both shall walk the way of years,      Till the twilight of the gods.\"                Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).      The cold winds continually swept down from the north, chilling all  the earth, and the Northmen imagined that these were set in motion  by the great giant Hrae-svelgr (the corpse-swallower), who, clad in  eagle plumes, sat at the extreme northern verge of the heavens, and  that when he raised his arms or wings the cold blasts darted forth  and swept ruthlessly over the face of the earth, blighting all things  with their icy breath.          \"Hrae-svelger is the name of him      Who sits beyond the end of heaven,      And winnows wide his eagle-wings,      Whence the sweeping blasts have birth.\"                Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).        Dwarfs and Elves    While the gods were occupied in creating the earth and providing  for its illumination, a whole host of maggot-like creatures had  been breeding in Ymir's flesh. These uncouth beings now attracted  divine attention. Summoning them into their presence, the gods first  gave them forms and endowed them with superhuman intelligence, and  then divided them into two large classes. Those which were dark,  treacherous, and cunning by nature were banished to Svart-alfa-heim,  the home of the black dwarfs, situated underground, whence they were  never allowed to come forth during the day, under penalty of being  turned into stone. They were called Dwarfs, Trolls, Gnomes, or Kobolds,  and spent all their time and energy in exploring the secret recesses  of the earth. They collected gold, silver, and precious stones,  which they stowed away in secret crevices, whence they could withdraw  them at will. The remainder of these small creatures, including all  that were fair, good, and useful, the gods called Fairies and Elves,  and they sent them to dwell in the airy realm of Alf-heim (home of  the light-elves), situated between heaven and earth, whence they  could flit downward whenever they pleased, to attend to the plants  and flowers, sport with the birds and butterflies, or dance in the  silvery moonlight on the green.    Odin, who had been the leading spirit in all these undertakings,  now bade the gods, his descendants, follow him to the broad plain  called Idawold, far above the earth, on the other side of the great  stream Ifing, whose waters never froze.          \"Ifing's deep and murky wave      Parts the ancient sons of earth      From the dwelling of the Goths:      Open flows the mighty flood,      Nor shall ice arrest its course      While the wheel of Ages rolls.\"                Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).      In the centre of the sacred space, which from the beginning of the  world had been reserved for their own abode and called Asgard (home of  the gods), the twelve AEsir (gods) and twenty-four Asynjur (goddesses)  all assembled at the bidding of Odin. Then was held a great council,  at which it was decreed that no blood should be shed within the limits  of their realm, or peace-stead, but that harmony should reign there  for ever. As a further result of the conference the gods set up a  forge where they fashioned all their weapons and the tools required  to build the magnificent palaces of precious metals, in which they  lived for many long years in a state of such perfect happiness that  this period has been called the Golden Age.        The Creation of Man    Although the gods had from the beginning designed Midgard, or  Mana-heim, as the abode of man, there were at first no human beings to  inhabit it. One day Odin, Vili, and Ve, according to some authorities,  or Odin, Hoenir (the bright one), and Lodur, or Loki (fire), started  out together and walked along the seashore, where they found either  two trees, the ash, Ask, and the elm, Embla, or two blocks of wood,  hewn into rude semblances of the human form. The gods gazed at first  upon the inanimate wood in silent wonder; then, perceiving the use it  could be put to, Odin gave these logs souls, Hoenir bestowed motion  and senses, and Lodur contributed blood and blooming complexions.    Thus endowed with speech and thought, and with power to love and to  hope and to work, and with life and death, the newly created man and  woman were left to rule Midgard at will. They gradually peopled it  with their descendants, while the gods, remembering they had called  them into life, took a special interest in all they did, watched over  them, and often vouchsafed their aid and protection.        The Tree Yggdrasil    Allfather next created a huge ash called Yggdrasil, the tree of the  universe, of time, or of life, which filled all the world, taking  root not only in the remotest depths of Nifl-heim, where bubbled the  spring Hvergelmir, but also in Midgard, near Mimir's well (the ocean),  and in Asgard, near the Urdar fountain.    From its three great roots the tree attained such a marvellous height  that its topmost bough, called Lerad (the peace-giver), overshadowed  Odin's hall, while the other wide-spreading branches towered over the  other worlds. An eagle was perched on the bough Lerad, and between  his eyes sat the falcon Vedfolnir, sending his piercing glances down  into heaven, earth, and Nifl-heim, and reporting all that he saw.    As the tree Yggdrasil was ever green, its leaves never withering,  it served as pasture-ground not only for Odin's goat Heidrun, which  supplied the heavenly mead, the drink of the gods, but also for the  stags Dain, Dvalin, Duneyr, and Durathor, from whose horns honey-dew  dropped down upon the earth and furnished the water for all the rivers  in the world.    In the seething cauldron Hvergelmir, close by the great tree, a  horrible dragon, called Nidhug, continually gnawed the roots, and  was helped in his work of destruction by countless worms, whose aim  it was to kill the tree, knowing that its death would be the signal  for the downfall of the gods.          \"Through all our life a tempter prowls malignant,        The cruel Nidhug from the world below.      He hates that asa-light whose rays benignant        On th' hero's brow and glitt'ring sword bright glow.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).      Scampering continually up and down the branches and trunk of the  tree, the squirrel Ratatosk (branch-borer), the typical busybody  and tale-bearer, passed its time repeating to the dragon below the  remarks of the eagle above, and vice versa, in the hope of stirring  up strife between them.        The Bridge Bifroest    It was, of course, essential that the tree Yggdrasil should be  maintained in a perfectly healthy condition, and this duty was  performed by the Norns, or Fates, who daily sprinkled it with the  holy waters from the Urdar fountain. This water, as it trickled down  to earth through branches and leaves, supplied the bees with honey.    From either edge of Nifl-heim, arching high above Midgard, rose the  sacred bridge, Bifroest (Asabru, the rainbow), built of fire, water,  and air, whose quivering and changing hues it retained, and over which  the gods travelled to and fro to the earth or to the Urdar well, at  the foot of the ash Yggdrasil, where they daily assembled in council.                              \"The gods arose      And took their horses, and set forth to ride      O'er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall's watch,      To the ash Igdrasil, and Ida's plain.      Thor came on foot, the rest on horseback rode.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      Of all the gods Thor only, the god of thunder, never passed over the  bridge, for fear lest his heavy tread or the heat of his lightnings  would destroy it. The god Heimdall kept watch and ward there night  and day. He was armed with a trenchant sword, and carried a trumpet  called Giallar-horn, upon which he generally blew a soft note to  announce the coming or going of the gods, but upon which a terrible  blast would be sounded when Ragnarok should come, and the frost-giants  and Surtr combined to destroy the world.          \"Surt from the south comes      With flickering flame;      Shines from his sword      The Val-god's sun.      The stony hills are dashed together,      The giantesses totter;      Men tread the path of Hel,      And heaven is cloven.\"                Saemund's Edda (Thorpe's tr.).        The Vanas    Now although the original inhabitants of heaven were the AEsir,  they were not the sole divinities of the Northern races, who also  recognised the power of the sea- and wind-gods, the Vanas, dwelling  in Vana-heim and ruling their realms as they pleased. In early times,  before the golden palaces in Asgard were built, a dispute arose between  the AEsir and Vanas, and they resorted to arms, using rocks, mountains,  and icebergs as missiles in the fray. But discovering ere long that  in unity alone lay strength, they composed their differences and made  peace, and to ratify the treaty they exchanged hostages.    It was thus that the Van, Nioerd, came to dwell in Asgard with his two  children, Frey and Freya, while the Asa, Hoenir, Odin's own brother,  took up his abode in Vana-heim.              CHAPTER II: ODIN      The Father of Gods and Men    Odin, Wuotan, or Woden was the highest and holiest god of the  Northern races. He was the all-pervading spirit of the universe, the  personification of the air, the god of universal wisdom and victory,  and the leader and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#4)"],[1,"his sons, Aristobulus and Antigonus, over the siege; who  pushed it on so hard, that a famine so far prevailed within the city,  that they were forced to eat what never was esteemed food. They  also invited Antiochus, who was called Cyzicenus, to come to their  assistance; whereupon he got ready, and complied with their invitation,  but was beaten by Aristobulus and Antigonus; and indeed he was pursued  as far as Scythopolis by these brethren, and fled away from them. So  they returned back to Samaria, and shut the multitude again within the  wall; and when they had taken the city, they demolished it, and made  slaves of its inhabitants. And as they had still great success in their  undertakings, they did not suffer their zeal to cool, but marched with  an army as far as Scythopolis, and made an incursion upon it, and laid  waste all the country that lay within Mount Carmel.    8. But then these successes of John and of his sons made them be envied,  and occasioned a sedition in the country; and many there were who got  together, and would not be at rest till they brake out into open war,  in which war they were beaten. So John lived the rest of his life very  happily, and administered the government after a most extraordinary  manner, and this for thirty-three entire years together. He died,  leaving five sons behind him. He was certainly a very happy man, and  afforded no occasion to have any complaint made of fortune on his  account. He it was who alone had three of the most desirable things in  the world,--the government of his nation, and the high priesthood, and  the gift of prophecy. For the Deity conversed with him, and he was  not ignorant of any thing that was to come afterward; insomuch that he  foresaw and foretold that his two eldest sons would not continue masters  of the government; and it will highly deserve our narration to describe  their catastrophe, and how far inferior these men were to their father  in felicity.              CHAPTER 3.           How Aristobulus Was The First That Put A Diadem About His       Head; And After He Had Put His Mother And Brother To Death,       Died Himself, When He Had Reigned No More Than A Year.    1. For after the death of their father, the elder of them, Aristobulus,  changed the government into a kingdom, and was the first that put a  diadem upon his head, four hundred seventy and one years and three  months after our people came down into this country, when they were set  free from the Babylonian slavery. Now, of his brethren, he appeared to  have an affection for Antigonus, who was next to him, and made him his  equal; but for the rest, he bound them, and put them in prison. He also  put his mother in bonds, for her contesting the government with him;  for John had left her to be the governess of public affairs. He also  proceeded to that degree of barbarity as to cause her to be pined to  death in prison.    2. But vengeance circumvented him in the affair of his brother  Antigonus, whom he loved, and whom he made his partner in the kingdom;  for he slew him by the means of the calumnies which ill men about the  palace contrived against him. At first, indeed, Aristobulus would  not believe their reports, partly out of the affection he had for his  brother, and partly because he thought that a great part of these tales  were owing to the envy of their relaters: however, as Antigonus came  once in a splendid manner from the army to that festival, wherein our  ancient custom is to make tabernacles for God, it happened, in those  days, that Aristobulus was sick, and that, at the conclusion of the  feast, Antigonus came up to it, with his armed men about him; and this  when he was adorned in the finest manner possible; and that, in a great  measure, to pray to God on the behalf of his brother. Now at this very  time it was that these ill men came to the king, and told him in what  a pompous manner the armed men came, and with what insolence Antigonus  marched, and that such his insolence was too great for a private person,  and that accordingly he was come with a great band of men to kill him;  for that he could not endure this bare enjoyment of royal honor, when it  was in his power to take the kingdom himself.    3. Now Aristobulus, by degrees, and unwillingly, gave credit to these  accusations; and accordingly he took care not to discover his suspicion  openly, though he provided to be secure against any accidents; so he  placed the guards of his body in a certain dark subterranean passage;  for he lay sick in a place called formerly the Citadel, though  afterwards its name was changed to Antonia; and he gave orders that if  Antigonus came unarmed, they should let him alone; but if he came to him  in his armor, they should kill him. He also sent some to let him know  beforehand that he should come unarmed. But, upon this occasion, the  queen very cunningly contrived the matter with those that plotted his  ruin, for she persuaded those that were sent to conceal the king's  message; but to tell Antigonus how his brother had heard he had got a  very the suit of armor made with fine martial ornaments, in Galilee;  and because his present sickness hindered him from coming and seeing all  that finery, he very much desired to see him now in his armor; because,  said he, in a little time thou art going away from me.    4. As soon as Antigonus heard this, the good temper of his brother not  allowing him to suspect any harm from him, he came along with his armor  on, to show it to his brother; but when he was going along that dark  passage which was called Strato's Tower, he was slain by the body  guards, and became an eminent instance how calumny destroys all  good-will and natural affection, and how none of our good affections are  strong enough to resist envy perpetually.    5. And truly any one would be surprised at Judas upon this occasion. He  was of the sect of the Essens, and had never failed or deceived men in  his predictions before. Now this man saw Antigonus as he was passing  along by the temple, and cried out to his acquaintance, [they were not a  few who attended upon him as his scholars,] \"O strange!\" said he, \"it is  good for me to die now, since truth is dead before me, and somewhat that  I have foretold hath proved false; for this Antigonus is this day alive,  who ought to have died this day; and the place where he ought to be  slain, according to that fatal decree, was Strato's Tower, which is at  the distance of six hundred furlongs from this place; and yet four hours  of this day are over already; which point of time renders the prediction  impossible to be fill filled.\" And when the old man had said this, he  was dejected in his mind, and so continued. But in a little time news  came that Antigonus was slain in a subterraneous place, which was itself  also called Strato's Tower, by the same name with that Cesarea which lay  by the sea-side; and this ambiguity it was which caused the prophet's  disorder.    6. Hereupon Aristobulus repented of the great crime he had been guilty  of, and this gave occasion to the increase of his distemper. He also  grew worse and worse, and his soul was constantly disturbed at the  thoughts of what he had done, till his very bowels being torn to pieces  by the intolerable grief he was under, he threw up a great quantity of  blood. And as one of those servants that attended him carried out that  blood, he, by some supernatural providence, slipped and fell down in the  very place where Antigonus had been slain; and so he spilt some of  the murderer's blood upon the spots of the blood of him that had been  murdered, which still appeared. Hereupon a lamentable cry arose among  the spectators, as if the servant had spilled the blood on purpose in  that place; and as the king heard that cry, he inquired what was the  cause of it; and while nobody durst tell him, he pressed them so much  the more to let him know what was the matter; so at length, when he had  threatened them, and forced them to speak out, they told; whereupon he  burst into tears, and groaned, and said, \"So I perceive I am not like  to escape the all-seeing eye of God, as to the great crimes I have  committed; but the vengeance of the blood of my kinsman pursues me  hastily. O thou most impudent body! how long wilt thou retain a soul  that ought to die on account of that punishment it ought to suffer for a  mother and a brother slain! How long shall I myself spend my blood drop  by drop? let them take it all at once; and let their ghosts no longer be  disappointed by a few parcels of my bowels offered to them.\" As soon  as he had said these words, he presently died, when he had reigned no  longer than a year.              CHAPTER 4.           What Actions Were Done By Alexander Janneus, Who Reigned       Twenty-Seven Years.    1. And now the king's wife loosed the king's brethren, and made  Alexander king, who appeared both elder in age, and more moderate in his  temper than the rest; who, when he came to the government, slew one of  his brethren, as affecting to govern himself; but had the other of them  in great esteem, as loving a quiet life, without meddling with public  affairs.    2. Now it happened that there was a battle between him and Ptolemy, who  was called Lathyrus, who had taken the city Asochis. He indeed slew a  great many of his enemies, but the victory rather inclined to Ptolemy.  But when this Ptolemy was pursued by his mother Cleopatra, and retired  into Egypt, Alexander besieged Gadara, and took it; as also he did  Amathus, which was the strongest of all the fortresses that were about  Jordan, and therein were the most precious of all the possessions of  Theodorus, the son of Zeno. Whereupon Theodorus marched against him, and  took what belonged to himself as well as the king's baggage, and slew  ten thousand of the Jews. However, Alexander recovered this blow, and  turned his force towards the maritime parts, and took Raphia "]]]
