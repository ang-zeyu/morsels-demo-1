Then of a sudden he started in a direction opposite to  that taken by the machine.    \"He is going away!\" cried Sam.    \"Come on after him!\" called his big brother, and ran from the cave with  the others at his heels. Just as he did this Dangler glanced back and  saw them.    \"Hey, you!\" he cried in consternation.    \"Stop!\" called out Dick. \"We want you.\"    At this command Dangler was more amazed than ever. But of a sudden he  appeared to realize something of what had happened and commenced to run.    \"Stop!\" cried Tom and Sam, but at this the man only ran the faster.    \"Come on--we've got to catch that rascal!\" exclaimed Dick, and started  to sprint. The others followed as quickly as they could, and a rapid  chase along the mountain road ensued. But if the boys could run so could  the freight robber, and he made the best possible use of his legs until  he gained a side trail. Then he darted into this, and when the Rover  boys came up he had disappeared.    \"Where is he?\" panted Sam.    \"He took to this path, but he isn't in sight,\" answered Dick. He was  almost winded himself.    \"Come on, he must be somewhere around,\" put in Tom, and ran down the  path several hundred feet. Then he tripped over a fallen log and went  headlong in the bushes and wet grass. He got up looking tired out and  cross.    \"We've missed him,\" announced Dick, rather dismally. \"It's a pity, too.  He deserves to be put under arrest.\"    \"I think we had better get home and warn Uncle Randolph,\" returned Sam.  \"If we don't there is no telling what that fellow Merrick and that Pike  may do.\"          CHAPTER IV    AT THE FARM      The others considered Sam's advice good, and after another look around  for Dangler, they turned in the direction of home. They were a good  three miles from the farm and had to cross the river above the falls,  thus adding half a mile more to the journey. It was wet and muddy  walking and they had not covered over a mile when Tom called a halt.    \"I am about fagged out,\" he announced. \"Wonder if we can't hire a buggy  at the next farmhouse.\"    \"We can try anyway,\" answered Dick.    Directly after crossing the river they came to a small farmhouse, and  walked around to the kitchen, where they saw an old woman shelling peas.    \"We can't let you have any carriage,\" she said. \"The men folks are to  town and they've got the horses.\"    The boys were about to turn away when Dick thought of something.    \"By the way, do you know a man named Dangler?\" he asked.    \"Sure, I do,\" was the answer.    \"Does he live around here?\"    \"I guess he lives where he pleases. He is an old bachelor and comes and  goes as he likes. He used to have a cottage down the pike, but it burnt  down last winter.\"    \"Then you haven't any idea where he is stopping now?\"    \"No.\"    \"Do you know a man named Merrick and another man named Pike?\" went on  the eldest Rover boy.    At this the old woman shook her head.    \"Never heard tell of them,\" she said.    \"Has this Dangler any relatives around here?\" asked Tom.    \"None that I know of.\"    \"Do you know what kind of man he is?\" asked Sam.    \"I never talk about my neighbors,\" answered the old woman, and drew up  her thin lips and went on shelling peas.    Feeling it would be useless to ask any more questions, the three boys  journeyed wearily on to the next farmhouse. This belonged to a fat  German named Gus Schmidt, who knew the Rovers fairly well.    \"Yah, I let you haf a carriage alretty,\" said Gus Schmidt. \"Put you must  pring him back to-morrow, hey?\"    \"We will,\" answered Dick.    \"I vos hear some putty goot stories apout you Rofer poys,\" went on Mr.  Schmidt, while he was hooking up his horse. \"You vos on der Mississippi  Rifer, hey?\"    \"We were,\" answered Sam.    \"Und you vos go owid on der blains und catch some counterfeiters, hey?\"    \"Yes, we had something to do with it,\" came from Tom.    \"Und den you vos go py der Gulluf of Mexico alretty und find a steampoat  vos has nopotty got on it,\" pursued Gus Schmidt. \"Ach, it vos vonderful  vot vos habben to somepody, ain't it?\"    \"Didn't you ever have anything happen to you, Mr. Schmidt?\" asked Sam.    \"Only vonce, und dot vos enough. I peen in New York, und der poys call  me names. Den I run after dem, und da vos go py a cellar full of vater.  I vos run on a poard, und der poys turn dot poard----\"    \"And you fell into the water,\" finished Tom.    \"Not much! I chumped back to der sidevalk,\" answered Gus Schmidt, and  then laughed heartily at his little joke.    The three Rover boys were soon in the carriage and on the way to the  farm. The horse that had been loaned to them was a speedy animal and  they made good time despite the muddiness of the road. The brief storm  had been a severe one, and in one spot the roadbed was considerably  washed out.    The boys took the carriage around to the barn and left it in charge of  Jack Ness, the man of all work. Then they hurried to the house.    \"Oh, boys, I am so glad that you are back!\" exclaimed Mrs. Rover, on  seeing them. \"I suppose you are wet through. Better dry your clothing at  once, or change them, and I'll get you some hot tea to drink.\"    \"We are all right, Aunt Martha,\" answered Dick. \"We were under shelter  during the worst of the storm. Is Uncle Randolph around?\"    \"No, he went to Carwell on business. I am worried about him, for I am  afraid he got caught in the storm, for he drove over.\"    \"What did he go for?\" questioned Tom, quickly.    \"Oh, it was a private matter.\"    \"About some traction company bonds?\" asked Sam, who could not hold back  his curiosity.    \"Yes. But how do you happen to know about it?\" demanded his aunt, in  astonishment.    \"We found something out to-day, aunty,\" said Dick. \"It's a queer piece  of business. Do you know where Uncle Randolph was going?\"    \"You mean in Carwell?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I think to the hotel.\"    \"Hum,\" mused the eldest of the Rover boys. \"Wonder if I can get him on  the telephone?\" For a telephone line had been put up from Oak Run to the  farm.    \"Why, Dick, is there anything wrong?\" demanded Mrs. Rover, turning pale.    \"I hope not, Aunt Martha. We'll soon know. Don't worry, please.\"    \"Your uncle was very much disturbed when he went away.\"    \"I am going to try to telephone to him at once,\" said Dick.    The telephone was on a landing of the stairs, where the bell could  readily be heard upstairs and down, and Dick lost no time in taking down  the receiver and calling up the office at Oak Run.    \"I want to get the hotel at Carwell,\" he told the operator. \"This is 685  W,\" he added.    \"I cannot give you Carwell,\" was the answer.    \"Why not?\"    \"The lightning struck down some of our poles and the line is out of  commission.\"    This was dismaying news and for the moment Dick was nonplussed. Then he  spoke to the operator again.    \"Can you reach Farleytown?\"    \"Yes, but the line from Farleytown to Carwell is down, too,\" came over  the wire.    \"Can you reach Deeming's Corners?\"    \"No. Can't get to Carwell in any way at all,\" was the decided answer,  and Dick hung up the receiver much crestfallen.    \"The storm has knocked the telephone service into a cocked hat,\" he  explained to the others. \"The only way for us to reach Carwell is to  drive there.\"    \"Then let us do that, and right away!\" cried Tom, who had been talking  to his aunt. \"Uncle Randolph took those ten thousand dollars worth of  traction company bonds with him, and Aunt Martha says the bonds were  unregistered, so anybody could use them.\"    \"Do you think somebody is going to steal the bonds?\" asked the aunt.    \"Two men are up to some game,--that is as much as we know,\" said Dick,  thinking it unwise to keep his aunt in the dark any longer. \"And we know  the men are rascals,\" he added.    \"Oh, will they--they attack your uncle?\"    \"I don't think they are that kind,\" said Sam. \"I think they'll try to  get the bonds away by some slick game.\"    The aunt hated to see the boys go on a mission of possible peril and yet  she wanted to have her husband warned. The lads ran down to the barn and  had Jack Ness hitch up a fresh team to a buckboard. It was now growing  dark.    \"Take good care of yourselves,\" cried Mrs. Rover, as they drove off. \"If  the telephone and telegraph poles are down on the road see that you do  not run into any of them.\"    They were driving to the gateway of the big farm when they saw Alexander  Pop running after them, flourishing something in his hand. Aleck was a  colored man who had once worked at Putnam Hall, but who was now attached  to the Rover household.    \"I was jess a-thinkin' that maybe yo' boys wasn't armed,\" he said. \"If  yo' ain't, don't yo' want dis pistol?\" And he held up a weapon he had  purchased while on the river trip with them.    \"I didn't think there would be any shooting,\" answered Dick. \"But now  you've brought it, I might as well take the pistol along,\" and he placed  the weapon in his pocket.    \"Perhaps yo' would like to hab dis chicken along?\" went on the colored  man. He delighted to be with the Rover boys on every possible occasion.    \"No, the buckboard is crowded now,\" answered Dick. \"You do what you can  to quiet Mrs. Rover.\"    \"Yes, tell her not to worry about us,\" added Tom.    \"And don't mention the pistol,\" called Sam, as the turnout moved on  again.    After leaving the vicinity of the farm, the boys had a distance of  thirteen miles to cover. Part of the road lay through the valley which  had given the farm its name, but then it ran up and over a series of  hills, and through several patches of woods. Under the trees it was  dark, and they had to slacken their speed for fear of accident.    \"Danger ahead!\" cried Sam presently, and Dick, who was driving, brought  the team to a halt. Across the road lay an uprooted tree.    \"Can't drive around that,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22168"],[0,"The Golden Spears (#4)"],[1,"so engaged  he heard a rustle in a clump of sedge that grew close to one side of  the hut. He turned to where the sound came from, and what should he see  but an otter swimming towards him, with a little trout in his mouth.  When the otter came up to where Enda was lying, he lifted his head and  half his body from the water, and flung the trout on the platform,  almost at Enda's feet, and then disappeared.    Enda took the little panting trout in his hand; but as he did so he  heard, quite close to him, in the lake, a sound like that of water  plashing upon water, and he saw the widening circles caused by a trout  which had just risen to a fly; and he said to the little trout he held  in his hand:    \"I won't keep you, poor thing! Perhaps that was a little comrade come  to look for you, and so I'll send you back to him.\"    And saying this, he dropped the little trout into the lake.    Well, when the next evening came, again Enda was lying stretched outside  the hut, and once more he heard the rustle in the sedge, and once more  the otter came and flung the little trout almost into his hands.    Enda, more surprised than ever, did not know what to do. He saw that it  was the same little trout the otter had brought him the night before,  and he said:    \"Well, I gave you a chance last night. I'll give you another, if only to  see what will come of it.\"    And he dropped the trout into the lake; but no sooner had it touched the  waters than it was changed into a beautiful, milk-white swan. And Enda  could hardly believe his eyes, as he saw it sailing across the lake,  until it was lost in the sedges growing by the shore.    All that night he lay awake, thinking of what he had seen, and as soon  as the morning stood on the hill-tops, and cast its shafts of golden  light across the lake, Enda rose and got into his curragh.    He rowed all round the shores, beating the sedges with his oar, in  pursuit of the swan; but all in vain; he could not catch a glimpse of  her white plumage anywhere. Day after day he rowed about the lake in  search of her, and every evening he lay outside the hut watching the  waters. At long last, one night, when the full moon, rising above the  mountains, flooded the whole lake with light, he saw the swan coming  swiftly towards him, shining brighter than the moonbeams. The swan came  on until it was almost within a boat's length of the hut; and what  should Enda hear but the swan speaking to him in his own language:    \"Get into your curragh, Enda, and follow me,\" said she, and, saying  this, she turned round and sailed away.    Enda jumped into the curragh, and soon the water, dripping from his oar,  was flashing like diamonds in the moonlight. And he rowed after the  swan, who glided on before him, until she came to where the shadows of  the mountains lay deepest on the lake. Then the swan rested, and when  Enda came up to her:    \"Enda,\" said she, \"I have brought you where none may hear what I wish to  say to you. I am Mave, the daughter of the king of Erin. By the magic  arts of my cruel stepmother I was changed into a trout, and cast into  this lake a year and a day before the evening when you restored me to  the waters the second time. If you had not done so the first night the  otter brought me to you I should have been changed into a hooting owl;  if you had not done so the second night, I should have been changed into  a croaking raven. But, thanks to you, Enda, I am now a snow-white swan,  and for one hour on the first night of every full moon the power of  speech is and will be given to me as long as I remain a swan. And a swan  I must always remain, unless you are willing to break the spell of  enchantment that is over me; and you alone can break it.\"    \"I'll do anything I can for you, O princess!\" said Enda. \"But how can  I break the spell?\"    \"You can do so,\" said the swan, \"only by pouring upon my plumage the  perfumed water that fills the golden bowl that is in the inmost room of  the palace of the fairy queen, beneath the lake.\"    \"And how can I get that?\" said Enda.    \"Well,\" said the swan, \"you must dive beneath the lake, and walk along  its bed, until you come to where the lake dragon guards the entrance of  the fairy queen's dominions.\"    \"I can dive like a fish,\" said Enda; \"but how can I walk beneath the  waters?\"    \"You can do it easily enough,\" said the swan, \"if you get the  water-dress of Brian, one of the three sons of Turenn, and his helmet  of transparent crystal, by the aid of which he was able to walk under  the green salt sea.\"[3]    \"And where shall I find them?\"    \"They are in the water-palace of Angus of the Boyne,\" said the swan;  \"but you should set out at once, for if the spell be not broken before  the moon is full again, it cannot be broken for a year and a day.\"    \"I'll set out in the first ray of the morning,\" said Enda.    \"May luck and joy go with you,\" said the swan. \"And now the hours  of silence are coming upon me, and I have only time to warn you that  dangers you little dream of will lie before you in your quest for the  golden cup.\"    \"I am willing to face all dangers for your sake, O princess,\" said Enda.    \"Blessings be upon you, Enda,\" said the swan, and she sailed away from  the shadow out into the light across the lake to the sedgy banks. And  Enda saw her no more.    He rowed his curragh home, and he lay on his bed without taking off his  clothes. And as the first faint glimmer of the morning came slanting down  the mountains, he stepped into his curragh and pulled across the lake,  and took the road towards the water-palace of Angus of the Boyne.    When he reached the banks of the glancing river a little woman, dressed  in red, was standing there before him.    \"You are welcome, Enda,\" said she. \"And glad am I to see the day that  brings you here to help the winsome Princess Mave. And now wait a  second, and the water-dress and crystal helmet will be ready for you.\"    And, having said this, the little woman plucked a handful of wild  grasses, and she breathed upon them three times and then flung them on  the river, and a dozen fairy nymphs came springing up through the water,  bearing the water-dress and crystal helmet and a shining spear. And they  laid them down upon the bank at Enda's feet, and then disappeared.    \"Now, Enda,\" said the fairy woman, \"take these; by the aid of the dress  and the helmet you can walk beneath the waters. You will need the spear  to enable you to meet the dangers that lie before you. But with that  spear, if you only have courage, you can overcome everything and everyone  that may attempt to bar your way.\"    Having said this, she bid good-by to Enda, and stepping off the bank,  she floated out upon the river as lightly as a red poppy leaf. And when  she came to the middle of the stream she disappeared beneath the waters.    Enda took the helmet, dress, and spear, and it was not long until he  came to the sedgy banks where his little boat was waiting for him. As he  stepped into the curragh the moon was rising above the mountains. He  rowed on until he came to the hut, and having moored the boat to the  door, he put on the water-dress and the crystal helmet, and taking the  spear in his hand, he leaped over the side of the curragh, and sank down  and down until he touched the bottom. Then he walked along without  minding where he was going, and the only light he had was the shimmering  moonlight, which descended as faintly through the waters as if it came  through muffled glass. He had not gone very far when he heard a horrible  hissing, and straight before him he saw what he thought were two flaming  coals. After a few more steps he found himself face to face with the  dragon of the lake, the guardian of the palace of the fairy queen.  Before he had time to raise his spear, the dragon had wound its coils  around him, and he heard its horrible teeth crunching against the side  of his crystal helmet, and he felt the pressure of its coils around his  side, and the breath almost left his body; but the dragon, unable to  pierce the helmet, unwound his coils, and soon Enda's hands were free,  and before the dragon could attempt to seize him again, he drove his  spear through one of its fiery eyes, and, writhing with pain, the  hissing dragon darted through a cave behind him. Enda, gaining courage  from the dragon's flight, marched on until he came to a door of dull  brass set in the rocks. He tried to push it in before him, but he might  as well have tried to push away the rocks. While he was wondering what  he should do, he heard again the fierce hissing of the dragon, and saw  the red glare of his fiery eye dimly in the water.    Lifting his spear and hastily turning round to meet the furious monster,  Enda accidentally touched the door with the point of the spear, and the  door flew open. Enda passed through, and the door closed behind him with  a grating sound, and he marched along through a rocky pass which led to  a sandy plain.    As he stepped from the pass into the plain the sands began to move, as  if they were alive. In a second a thousand hideous serpents, almost the  color of the sand, rose hissing up, and with their forked tongues made a  horrible, poisonous hedge in front of him. For a second he stood  dismayed, but then, leveling his spear, he rushed against the hedge of  serpents, and they, shooting poison at him, sank beneath the sand. But  the poison did not harm him, because of his water-dress and crystal  helmet.    When he had passed over the sandy plain, he had to climb a great steep,  jagged rock. When he got to the top of the rock he saw spread out before  him a stony waste without a tuft or blade of grass. At some distance in  front of him he noticed a large dark object, which he took to be a rock,  but on looking at it more closely he saw that it was a huge, misshapen,  swollen mass, apparently alive. And it was growing bigger and bigger  every moment. Enda stood "]]]
