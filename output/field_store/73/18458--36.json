Beatrice awaited them  at a window which looked on to a secluded courtyard; she gave them  letters which she had written to her brother and to Monsignor Guerra.  The former was to approve, as he had done before, the murder of their  father; for she would do nothing without his sanction. As for Monsignor  Guerra, he was to pay Olympio a thousand piastres, half the stipulated  sum; Marzio acting out of pure love for Beatrice, whom he worshipped as  a Madonna; which observing, the girl gave him a handsome scarlet mantle,  trimmed with gold lace, telling him to wear it for love of her. As for  the remaining moiety, it was to be paid when the death of the old man  had placed his wife and daughter in possession of his fortune.    The two sbirri departed, and the imprisoned conspirators anxiously  awaited their return. On the day fixed, they were seen again. Monsignor  Guerra had paid the thousand piastres, and Giacomo had given his  consent. Nothing now stood in the way of the execution of this terrible  deed, which was fixed for the 8th of September, the day of the Nativity  of the Virgin; but Signora Lucrezia, a very devout person, having  noticed this circumstance, would not be a party to the committal of a  double sin; the matter was therefore deferred till the next day, the  9th.    That evening, the 9th of September, 1598, the two women, supping with  the old man, mixed some narcotic with his wine so adroitly that,  suspicious though he was, he never detected it, and having swallowed the  potion, soon fell into a deep sleep.    The evening previous, Marzio and Olympio had been admitted into the  castle, where they had lain concealed all night and all day; for, as  will be remembered, the assassination would have been effected the day  before had it not been for the religious scruples of Signora Lucrezia  Petroni. Towards midnight, Beatrice fetched them out of their  hiding-place, and took them to her father's chamber, the door of which  she herself opened. The assassins entered, and the two women awaited the  issue in the room adjoining.    After a moment, seeing the sbirri reappear pale and nerveless, shaking  their heads without speaking, they at once inferred that nothing had  been done.    \"What is the matter?\" cried Beatrice; \"and what hinders you?\"    \"It is a cowardly act,\" replied the assassins, \"to kill a poor old man  in his sleep. At the thought of his age, we were struck with pity.\"    Then Beatrice disdainfully raised her head, and in a deep firm voice  thus reproached them.    \"Is it possible that you, who pretend to be brave and strong, have not  courage enough to kill a sleeping old man? How would it be if he were  awake? And thus you steal our money! Very well: since your cowardice  compels me to do so, I will kill my father myself; but you will not long  survive him.\"    Hearing these words, the sbirri felt ashamed of their irresolution, and,  indicating by signs that they would fulfil their compact, they entered  the room, accompanied by the two women. As they had said, a ray of  moonlight shone through the open window, and brought into prominence the  tranquil face of the old man, the sight of whose white hair had so  affected them.    This time they showed no mercy. One of them carried two great nails,  such as those portrayed in pictures of the Crucifixion; the other bore a  mallet: the first placed a nail upright over one of the old man's eyes;  the other struck it with the hammer, and drove it into his head. The  throat was pierced in the same way with the second nail; and thus the  guilty soul, stained throughout its career with crimes of violence, was  in its turn violently torn from the body, which lay writhing on the  floor where it had rolled.    The young girl then, faithful to her word, handed the sbirri a large  purse containing the rest of the sum agreed upon, and they left. When  they found themselves alone, the women drew the nails out of the wounds,  wrapped the corpse in a sheet, and dragged it through the rooms towards  a small rampart, intending to throw it down into a garden which had been  allowed to run to waste. They hoped that the old man's death would be  attributed to his having accidentally fallen off the terrace on his way  in the dark to a closet at the end of the gallery. But their strength  failed them when they reached the door of the last room, and, while  resting there, Lucrezia perceived the two sbirri, sharing the money  before making their escape. At her call they came to her, carried the  corpse to the rampart, and, from a spot pointed out by the women, where  the terrace was unfenced by any parapet, they threw it into an elder  tree below, whose branches retained' it suspended.    When the body was found the following morning hanging in the branches of  the elder tree, everybody supposed, as Beatrice and her stepmother had  foreseen, that Francesco, stepping over the edge of the 386 terrace in  the dark, had thus met his end. The body was so scratched and disfigured  that no one noticed the wounds made by the two nails. The ladies, as  soon as the news was imparted to them, came out from their rooms,  weeping and lamenting in so natural a manner as to disarm any  suspicions. The only person who formed any was the laundress to whom  Beatrice entrusted the sheet in which her father's body had been  wrapped, accounting for its bloody condition by a lame explanation,  which the laundress accepted without question, or pretended to do so;  and immediately after the funeral, the mourners returned to Rome, hoping  at length to enjoy quietude and peace. For some time, indeed, they did  enjoy tranquillity, perhaps poisoned by remorse, but ere long  retribution pursued them. The court of Naples, hearing of the sudden and  unexpected death of Francesco Cenci, and conceiving some suspicions of  violence, despatched a royal commissioner to Petrella to exhume the body  and make minute inquiries, if there appeared to be adequate grounds for  doing so. On his arrival all the domestics in the castle were placed  under arrest and sent in chains to Naples. No incriminating proofs,  however, were found, except in the evidence of the laundress, who  deposed that Beatrice had given her a bloodstained sheet to wash. This,  clue led to terrible consequences; for, further questioned she declared  that she could not believe the explanation given to account for its  condition. The evidence was sent to the Roman court; but at that period  it did not appear strong enough to warrant the arrest of the Cenci  family, who remained undisturbed for many months, during which time the  youngest boy died. Of the five brothers there only remained Giacomo, the  eldest, and Bernardo, the youngest but one. Nothing prevented them from  escaping to Venice or Florence; but they remained quietly in Rome.    Meantime Monsignor Guerra received private information that, shortly  before the death of Francesco, Marzio and Olympio had been seen prowling  round the castle, and that the Neapolitan police had received orders to  arrest them.    The monsignor was a most wary man, and very difficult to catch napping  when warned in time. He immediately hired two other sbirri to  assassinate Marzio and Olympio. The one commissioned to put Olympio out  of the way came across him at Terni, and conscientiously did his work  with a poniard, but Marzio's man unfortunately arrived at Naples too  late, and found his bird already in the hands of the police.    He was put to the torture, and confessed everything. His deposition was  sent to Rome, whither he shortly afterwards followed it, to be  confronted with the accused. Warrants were immediately issued for the  arrest of Giacomo, Bernardo, Lucrezia, and Beatrice; they were at first  confined in the Cenci palace under a strong guard, but the proofs  against them becoming stronger and stronger, they were removed to the  castle of Corte Savella, where they were confronted with Marzio; but  they obstinately denied both any complicity in the crime and any  knowledge of the assassin. Beatrice, above all, displayed the greatest  assurance, demanding to be the first to be confronted with Marzio; whose  mendacity she affirmed with such calm dignity, that he, more than ever  smitten by her beauty, determined, since he could not live for her, to  save her by his death. Consequently, he declared all his statements to  be false, and asked forgiveness from God and from Beatrice; neither  threats nor tortures could make him recant, and he died firm in his  denial, under frightful tortures. The Cenci then thought themselves  safe.    God's justice, however, still pursued them. The sbirro who had killed  Olympio happened to be arrested for another crime, and, making a clean  breast, confessed that he had been employed by Monsignor Guerra--to put  out of the way a fellow-assassin named Olympio, who knew too many of the  monsignor's secrets.    Luckily for himself, Monsignor Guerra heard of this opportunely. A man  of infinite resource, he lost not a moment in timid or irresolute plans,  but as it happened that at the very moment when he was warned, the  charcoal dealer who supplied his house with fuel was at hand, he sent  for him, purchased his silence with a handsome bribe, and then, buying  for almost their weight in gold the dirty old clothes which he wore, he  assumed these, cut off all his beautiful cherished fair hair, stained  his beard, smudged his face, bought two asses, laden with charcoal, and  limped up and down the streets of Rome, crying, \"Charcoal! charcoal!\"  Then, whilst all the detectives were hunting high and low for him, he  got out of the city, met a company of merchants under escort, joined  them, and reached Naples, where he embarked. What ultimately became of  him was never known; it has been asserted, but without confirmation,  that he succeeded--in reaching"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#4)"],[1,"than that to which they had subjected the Protestants; for, as we have  explained above, the former could only find shelter in the plain, while  the latter used the Cevennes as a stronghold.    It was about this time that the peace, which was called, as we have  said, \"the insecurely seated,\" was concluded. Two years later this name  was justified by the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.    When this event took place, the South, strange as it may seem, looked  on: in Nimes both Catholics and Protestants, stained with the other's  blood, faced each other, hand on hilt, but without drawing weapon. It  was as if they were curious to see how the Parisians would get through.  The massacre had one result, however, the union of the principal cities  of the South and West: Montpellier, Uzes, Montauban, and La Rochelle,  with Nimes at their head, formed a civil and military league to last, as  is declared in the Act of Federation, until God should raise up a  sovereign to be the defender of the Protestant faith. In the year 1775  the Protestants of the South began to turn their eyes towards Henri IV  as the coming defender.    At that date Nimes, setting an example to the other cities of the  League, deepened her moats, blew up her suburbs, and added to the height  of her ramparts. Night and day the work of perfecting the means of  defence went on; the guard at every gate was doubled, and knowing how  often a city had been taken by surprise, not a hole through which a  Papist could creep was left in the fortifications. In dread of what the  future might bring, Nimes even committed sacrilege against the past, and  partly demolished the Temple of Diana and mutilated the amphitheatre--of  which one gigantic stone was sufficient to form a section of the wall.  During one truce the crops were sown, during another they were garnered  in, and so things went on while the reign of the Mignons lasted. At  length the prince raised up by God, whom the Huguenots had waited for so  long, appeared; Henri IV ascended the, throne.    But once seated, Henri found himself in the same difficulty as had  confronted Octavius fifteen centuries earlier, and which confronted  Louis Philippe three centuries later--that is to say, having been raised  to sovereign power by a party which was not in the majority, he soon  found himself obliged to separate from this party and to abjure his  religious beliefs, as others have abjured or will yet abjure their  political beliefs; consequently, just as Octavius had his Antony, and  Louis Philippe was to have his Lafayette, Henri IV was to have his  Biron. When monarchs are in this position they can no longer have a will  of their own or personal likes and dislikes; they submit to the force of  circumstances, and feel compelled to rely on the masses; no sooner are  they freed from the ban under which they laboured than they are obliged  to bring others under it.    However, before having recourse to extreme measures, Henri IV with  soldierly frankness gathered round him all those who had been his  comrades of old in war and in religion; he spread out before them a map  of France, and showed them that hardly a tenth of the immense number of  its inhabitants were Protestants, and that even that tenth was shut up  in the mountains; some in Dauphine, which had been won for them by their  three principal leaders, Baron des Adrets, Captain Montbrun, and  Lesdiguieres; others in the Cevennes, which had become Protestant  through their great preachers, Maurice Secenat and Guillaume Moget; and  the rest in the mountains of Navarre, whence he himself had come. He  recalled to them further that whenever they ventured out of their  mountains they had been beaten in every battle, at Jarnac, at  Moncontour, and at Dreux. He concluded by explaining how impossible it  was for him, such being the case, to entrust the guidance of the State  to their party; but he offered them instead three things, viz., his  purse to supply their present needs, the Edict of Nantes to assure their  future safety, and fortresses to defend themselves should this edict one  day be revoked, for with profound insight the grandfather divined the  grandson: Henri IV feared Louis XIV.    The Protestants took what they were offered, but of course like all who  accept benefits they went away filled with discontent because they had  not been given more.    Although the Protestants ever afterwards looked on Henri IV as a  renegade, his reign nevertheless was their golden age, and while it  lasted Nines was quiet; for, strange to say, the Protestants took no  revenge for St. Bartholomew, contenting themselves with debarring the  Catholics from the open exercise of their religion, but leaving them  free to use all its rites and ceremonies in private. They even permitted  the procession of the Host through the streets in case of illness,  provided it took place at night. Of course death would not always wait  for darkness, and the Host was sometimes carried to the dying during the  day, not without danger to the priest, who, however, never let himself  be deterred thereby from the performance of his duty; indeed, it is of  the essence of religious devotion to be inflexible; and few soldiers,  however brave, have equalled the martyrs in courage.    During this time, taking advantage of the truce to hostilities and the  impartial protection meted out to all without distinction by the  Constable Damville, the Carmelites and Capuchins, the Jesuits and monks  of all orders and colours, began by degrees to return to Nines; without  any display, it is true, rather in a surreptitious manner, preferring  darkness to daylight; but however this may be, in the course of three or  four years they had all regained foothold in the town; only now they  were in the position in which the Protestants had been formerly, they  were without churches, as their enemies were in possession of all the  places of worship. It also happened that a Jesuit high in authority,  named Pere Coston, preached with such success that the Protestants, not  wishing to be beaten, but desirous of giving word for word, summoned to  their aid the Rev. Jeremie Ferrier, of Alais, who at the moment was  regarded as the most eloquent preacher they had. Needless to say, Alais  was situated in the mountains, that inexhaustible source of Huguenot  eloquence. At once the controversial spirit was aroused; it did not as  yet amount to war, but still less could it be called peace: people were  no longer assassinated, but they were anathematised; the body was safe,  but the soul was consigned to damnation: the days as they passed were  used by both sides to keep their hand in, in readiness for the moment  when the massacres should again begin.          CHAPTER II      The death of Henri IV led to new conflicts, in which although at first  success was on the side of the Protestants it by degrees went over to  the Catholics; for with the accession of Louis XIII Richelieu had taken  possession of the throne: beside the king sat the cardinal; under the  purple mantle gleamed the red robe. It was at this crisis that Henri de  Rohan rose to eminence in the South. He was one of the most illustrious  representatives of that great race which, allied as it was to the royal  houses of Scotland, France, Savoy, and Lorraine; had taken as their  device, \"Be king I cannot, prince I will not, Rohan I am.\"    Henri de Rohan was at this time about forty years of age, in the prime  of life. In his youth, in order to perfect his education, he had visited  England, Scotland, and Italy. In England Elizabeth had called him her  knight; in Scotland James VI had asked him to stand godfather to his  son, afterwards Charles I; in Italy he had been so deep in the  confidence of the leaders of men, and so thoroughly initiated into the  politics of the principal cities, that it was commonly said that, after  Machiavel, he was the greatest authority in these matters. He had  returned to France in the lifetime of Henry IV, and had married the  daughter of Sully, and after Henri's death had commanded the Swiss and  the Grison regiments--at the siege of Juliers. This was the man whom the  king was so imprudent as to offend by refusing him the reversion of the  office of governor of Poitou, which was then held by Sully, his  father-in-law. In order to revenge himself for the neglect he met with  at court, as he states in his Memoires with military ingenuousness, he  espoused the cause of Conde with all his heart, being also drawn in this  direction by his liking for Conde's brother and his consequent desire to  help those of Conde's religion.    From this day on street disturbances and angry disputes assumed another  aspect: they took in a larger area and were not so readily appeased. It  was no longer an isolated band of insurgents which roused a city, but  rather a conflagration which spread over the whole South, and a general  uprising which was almost a civil war.    This state of things lasted for seven or eight years, and during this  time Rohan, abandoned by Chatillon and La Force, who received as the  reward of their defection the field marshal's baton, pressed by Conde,  his old friend, and by Montmorency, his consistent rival, performed  prodigies of courage and miracles of strategy. At last, without  soldiers, without ammunition, without money, he still appeared to  Richelieu to be so redoubtable that all the conditions of surrender he  demanded were granted. The maintenance of the Edict of Nantes was  guaranteed, all the places of worship were to be restored to the  Reformers, and a general amnesty granted to himself and his partisans.  Furthermore, he obtained what was an unheard-of thing until then, an  indemnity of 300,000 livres for his expenses during the rebellion; of  which sum he allotted 240,000 livres to his co-religionists--that is to  say, more than three-quarters of the entire amount--and kept, for the  purpose of"]]]
