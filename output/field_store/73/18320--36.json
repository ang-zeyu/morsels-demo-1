The idea which leads to intercourse with  spiritual Beings is not interchangeable with that which finds its  realisation in rest and pleasure.\"    Priestcraft.--From the ceremonial of ancestor worship the thin end of  the wedge of priestcraft was rigorously excluded. \"For the words of  prayer and blessing and those of benediction to be kept hidden away by  the officers of prayer of the ancestral temple, and by the sorcerers and  recorders, is a violation of the rules of propriety. This may be called  keeping in a state of darkness.\"    Confucius sums up the value of sacrifices in the following words. \"By  their great sacrificial ceremonies the ancients served God; by their  ceremonies in the ancestral temple they worshipped their forefathers. He  who should understand the great sacrificial ceremonies, and the meaning  of the ceremonies in the ancestral temple, would find it as easy to  govern the empire as to look upon the palm of his hand.\"    Filial Piety.--Intimately connected with ancestral worship is the  practice of filial piety; it is in fact on filial piety that ancestral  worship is dependent for its existence. In early ages, sons sacrificed  to the manes of their parents and ancestors generally, in order to  afford some mysterious pleasure to the disembodied spirits. There was  then no idea of propitiation, of benefits to ensue. In later times, the  character of the sacrifice underwent a change, until a sentiment of _do  ut des_ became the real mainspring of the ceremony. Meanwhile, Confucius  had complained that the filial piety of his day only meant the support  of parents. \"But,\" argued the Sage, \"we support our dogs and our horses;  without reverence, what is there to distinguish one from the other?\" He  affirmed that children who would be accounted filial should give their  parents no cause of anxiety beyond such anxiety as might be occasioned  by ill-health. Filial piety, he said again, did not consist in relieving  the parents of toil, or in setting before them wine and food; it did  consist in serving them while alive according to the established rules,  in burying them when dead according to the established rules, and in  sacrificing to them after death, also according to the established  rules. In another passage Confucius declared that filial piety consists  in carrying on the aims of our forefathers, which really amounts to  serving the dead as they would have been served if alive.    Divination.--Divination seems to have been practised in China from  the earliest ages. The implements used were the shell of the tortoise,  spiritualised by the long life of its occupant, and the stalks of a kind  of grass, to which also spiritual powers had for some reason or other  been attributed. These were the methods, we are told, by which the  ancient Kings made their people revere spirits, obey the law, and settle  all their doubts. God gave these spiritual boons to mankind, and the  sages took advantage of them. \"To explore what is complex, to search  out what is hidden, to hook up what lies deep, and to reach to what is  distant, thereby determining the issues for good or ill of all events  under the sky, and making all men full of strenuous endeavour, there are  no agencies greater than those of the stalks and the tortoise shell.\"    In B.C. 2224, when the Emperor Shun wished to associate the Great Yu  with him in the government, the latter begged that recourse might be  had to divination, in order to discover the most suitable among the  Ministers for this exalted position. The Emperor refused, saying that  his choice had already been confirmed by the body of Ministers. \"The  spirits too have signified their assent, the tortoise and grass having  both concurred. Divination, when fortunate, may not be repeated.\"    Sincerity, on which Confucius lays such especial stress, is closely  associated with success in divination. \"Sincerity is of God; cultivation  of sincerity is of man. He who is naturally sincere is he who hits his  mark without effort, and without thinking apprehends. He easily keeps to  the golden mean; he is inspired. He who cultivates sincerity is he who  chooses what is good and holds fast to it.    \"It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to  foreknow. When a State or a family is about to flourish, there are sure  to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to  be unpropitious omens. The events portended are set forth by the  divining-grass and the tortoise. When calamity or good fortune may be  about to come, the evil or the good will be foreknown by the perfectly  sincere man, who may therefore be compared with a spirit.\"    The tortoise and the grass have long since disappeared as instruments of  divination, which is now carried on by means of lots drawn from a vase,  with answers attached; by planchette; and by the _chiao_. The last  consists of two pieces of wood, anciently of stone, in the shape of the  two halves of a kidney bean. These are thrown into the air before the  altar in a temple,--Buddhist or Taoist, it matters nothing,--with  the following results. Two convex sides uppermost mean a response  indifferently good; two flat sides mean negative and bad; one convex  and one flat side mean that the prayer will be granted. This form of  divination, though widely practised at the present day, is by no means  of recent date. It was common in the Ch'u State, which was destroyed  B.C. 300, after four hundred and twenty years of existence.        CHAPTER II -- CONFUCIANISM    Attitude of Confucius.--Under the influence of Confucius, B.C. 551-479,  the old order of things began to undergo a change. The Sage's attitude  of mind towards religion was one of a benevolent agnosticism, as summed  up in his famous utterance, \"Respect the spirits, but keep them at a  distance.\" That he fully recognised the existence of a spirit world,  though admitting that he knew nothing about it, is manifest from the  following remarks of his:--    \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to  them! We look for, but do not see them; we listen for, but do not hear  them; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without them.  They cause all the people in the empire to fast and purify themselves,  and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at  their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the  heads, and on the right and left, of their worshippers.\"    He believed that he himself was, at any rate to some extent, a prophet  of God, as witness his remarks when in danger from the people of  K'uang:--    \"After the death of King Wen, was not wisdom lodged in me? If God were  to destroy this wisdom, future generations could not possess it. So long  as God does not destroy this wisdom, what can the people of K'uang do to  me?\"    Again, when Confucius cried, \"Alas! there is no one that knows me,\" and  a disciple asked what was meant, he replied, \"I do not murmur against  God. I do not mumble against man. My studies lie low, and my penetration  lies high. But there is God; He knows me.\"    We know that Confucius fasted, and we know that \"he sacrificed to the  spirits as though the spirits were present;\" it is even stated that  \"when a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and  horses, unless it were flesh which had been used in sacrifice, he did  not bow.\" He declared that for a person in mourning food and music were  without flavour and charm; and whenever he saw anyone approaching  who was in mourning dress, even though younger than himself, he  would immediately rise from his seat. He believed in destiny; he was  superstitious, changing colour at a squall or at a clap of thunder; and  he even countenanced the ceremonies performed by villagers when driving  out evil spirits from their dwellings. He protested against any attempt  to impose on God. He said that \"he who offends against God has none to  whom he can pray;\" and when in an hour of sickness a disciple asked to  be allowed to pray for him, he replied, \"My praying has been for a long  time.\" Yet he declined to speak to his disciples of God, of spiritual  beings or even of death and a hereafter, holding that life and its  problems were alone sufficient to tax the energies of the human race.  While not altogether ignoring man's duty towards God, he subordinated  it in every way to man's duty towards his neighbour. He also did much  towards weakening the personality of God, for whom he invariably  used _T'ien_, never _Shang Ti_, regarding Him evidently more as  an abstraction than as a living sentient Being, with the physical  attributes of man. Confucianism is therefore entirely a system of  morality, and not a religion.    It is also a curious fact that throughout the _Spring and Autumn_, or  Annals of the State of Lu, which extend from B.C. 722 to B.C. 484, there  is no allusion of any kind to the interposition of God in human affairs,  although a variety of natural phenomena are recorded, such as have  always been regarded by primitive peoples as the direct acts of an  angered or benevolent Deity. Lu was the State in which Confucius was  born, and its annals were compiled by the Sage himself; and throughout  these Annals the term God is never used except in connection with the  word \"King,\" where it always has the sense of \"by the grace of God,\"  and once where the suzerain is spoken of as \"the Son of God,\" or, as we  usually phrase it, \"the Son of Heaven.\"    How to bring rain.--In the famous Commentary by Tso-ch'iu Ming on the  _Spring and Autumn_, which imparts a human interest to the bald entries  set against each year of these annals, there are several allusions to  the Supreme Being. For instance, at a time of great drought the Duke of  Lu wished, in accordance with custom, to burn a witch and a person in  the last stage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23301"],[0,"Each Man Kills (#4)"],[1,"tful._    _\"Tod, dearest,\" she said softly, \"I must die some day, really die, so  what difference does it make when? I only know that I love you. Why wait  until I'm decrepit and alone, with only a few memories to look back on?  Why not now, with you, where life doesn't really stop? With all I've  read about this, don't you think I could free myself if I wished?\"_    _I still wonder if she really believed me. We were married three days  later. I never told her what her life with me would be like--that one  day I would desert her, fearing and hating her rivalry for the very  source of my life, and the ghastly chain would continue. I couldn't. I  loved her so, Morris, can you understand that? I couldn't betray her  then and I can't now._    _On the second night of our marriage, she died as you know it, in my  arms. I don't think she knows it yet. But it won't be long until she  does discover it. We were quite alive when you found us; she was in an  hypnotic state induced by her condition. She heard and saw nothing. But  I knew. And I must keep my faith. I must, and you are the only one who  can help me._    _If you will show this to a priest, he will gladly accompany you to the  place in_ Konigstein, _where we rest during the morning in a new \"bed\" I  had specially constructed for us. I couldn't bring Maria to that other  bed of corruption. A map of how to get there is enclosed. There you will  perform the ancient, effective rites, and you will lay us to rest  together, as we wish. That is all I ask...._           *       *       *       *       *    When I had finished reading I stared at nothing, trying to force myself  to think. This was \"all\" he asked. In substance, he wished me to murder  the girl I loved. I could refuse; I could ignore his request. I could  even doubt the verity of his statements. He might be a madman. But I  didn't doubt. I believed every word, and I knew I would do as he asked.    That she had gone willingly I didn't doubt. I no longer hated him so  much; rather I pitied him, the hapless victim of a horrible chain of  circumstance.           *       *       *       *       *    I found the priest, a venerable, gentle soul, after much searching. The  younger men had looked at me searchingly, laughed and told me to read  the Good Book for consolation, and to lay off the bottle. Father Kalman  was understanding, with the wisdom of the very old.    \"Yes, my son,\" he said, \"I will go. Many might doubt, but I believe.  Lucifer roams the earth in many guises and must be recognized and  exorcised.\"    It was five o'clock in the morning when we approached the mausoleum. The  Good Father explained that the \"creatures of darkness\" had to be back in  their resting places before the cock crew. At night they drew  sustenance; during the morning they slept.    There was a gleaming copper casket. Tod had not lied. We approached it  warily. In it was nothing but grisly remains, bloodstains and dust. We  drew back, fearful. Then we saw the other, newer casket in richest  mahogany, almost twice the width of the copper box: _Their bridal bed!_    They lay together, his arm about her. She wore a gown of palest blue,  but oh, that mockery of a gown! Stained it was with fresh blood which  had seeped onto it from him. Obviously she had not taken to prowling  yet. His mouth was dark, rich with blood, slightly open in a half-smile.  His hand pressed her fair head close to his chest. She lay trustingly  within the circle of his arm, like a small child. The priest crossed  himself. The bodies twitched slightly.    \"You know what you must do,\" Father Kalman whispered.    I nodded, the pit of my stomach churning madly. I couldn't do it! Not  Maria, the lovely. But I knew I would; I had to. She must not wake again  to see that blood-stained gown or to wonder at her husband's gory lips.  She should know rest, eternal rest.    Father Kalman circled the box several times, ringing his small bell, and  at one point laid a crucifix upon each of their chests. Their faces  writhed and I felt my skin creep.    Then, chanting in a low, firm voice, the priest gave me the signal.  Together we drove two long stakes, dipped first in Holy Water, home,  piercing their hearts simultaneously.    The bodies leapt forward in the box, straining against the stake, and a  horrible, drawn-out wail shattered the stillness of the tomb. The priest  dropped to his knees and I clapped my hands over my ears, but the  dreadful shriek penetrated. My stomach turned over and I retched. The  Good Father followed suit. We were no supermen and our bodies and our  very souls revolted against this monstrous thing.    \"Let us finish, my son,\" the priest said slowly, after a time, his face  the color of ashes. \"We must bury these dead, that they may sleep in  consecrated ground.\"    I couldn't. I had to see her again before it was done. She lay, small  and fragile as ever, her face calm, only there was no trace of life now.  She was still and white, as only the dead--the truly dead--are. Tod's  arm was flung across her chest, as if to protect her. I made myself move  the arm, resting her head upon his shoulder, where it belonged. Then, as  I looked, there was just Maria. Tod was gone and only a handful of dust  lay piled up around the stake. It was enough. I slammed the lid shut.           *       *       *       *       *    Looking back now, I can see it was all for the best. Ria was  different--apart from other women. A dreamer, a mystic, too easily  influenced by the bizarre and un-normal. I, on the other hand, am  practical almost to a fault. Had she married me I might have crushed in  her the very thing that drew me to her. In time she might have grown to  hate me.    Hunter, on the other hand, was a student. Introspective, given to  romanticizing. Susceptible to suggestion. Had I been confronted with an  Eve, I should have run like hell. To him, though, she was cloaked in  mystery; hence, more desirable. What better choice for him ultimately  than Ria? That Ria had to die to achieve her happiness is of no real  importance. Life is a transitory thing anyway.    Sometimes, though, when I look at Ria's picture, it's hard to be  practical. She was everything I shall ever want.    I had never been to Europe before the summer of 1947. I went to find  Maria, to marry her. Instead, I found and murdered her, and I will never  go back again."]]]
