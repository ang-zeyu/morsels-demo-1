D. 230, not  to speak of personages of equestrian rank, whose names have been  collected in hundreds.    A difficulty may arise in the mind of the reader: how was it possible  for these magistrates, generals, consuls, officers, senators, and  governors of provinces, to attend to their duties without performing  acts of idolatry? In chapter xxxvii. of the Apology, Tertullian says:  \"We are but of yesterday, yet we fill every place that belongs to you,  cities, islands, outposts; we fill your assemblies, camps, tribes and  decuries; the imperial palace, the Senate, the forum; we only leave to  you your temples.\" But here lies the difficulty; how could they fill  these places, and leave the temples?    First of all, the Roman emperors gave plenty of liberty to the new  religion from time to time; and some of them, moved by a sort of  religious syncretism, even tried to ally it with the official worship  of the empire, and to place Christ and Jupiter on the steps of the  same _lararium_. The first attempt of the kind is attributed to  Tiberius; he is alleged to have sent a message to the Senate  requesting that Christ should be included among the gods, on the  strength of the official report written by Pontius Pilatus of the  passion and death of our Lord. Malala says that Nero made honest  inquiries about the new religion, and that, at first, he showed  himself rather favorable towards it; a fact not altogether improbable,  if we take into consideration the circumstances of Paul's appeal, his  absolution, and his relations with Seneca, and with the converts _de  domo Caesaris_, \"of the house of Caesar.\" Lampridius, speaking of the  religious sentiments of Alexander Severus, says: \"He was determined to  raise a temple to Christ, and enlisted him among the gods; a project  attributed also to Hadrian. There is no doubt that Hadrian ordered  temples to be erected in every city to an unknown god; and because  they have no statue we still call them temples of Hadrian. He is said  to have prepared them for Christ; but to have been deterred from  carrying his plan into execution by the consideration that the temples  of the old gods would become deserted, and the whole population turn  Christian, _omnes christianos futuros_.\"[6]    The freedom enjoyed by the Church under Caracalla is proved by the  _graffiti_ of the Domus Gelotiana, described in my \"Ancient Rome.\"[7]  The one caricaturing the crucifixion, which is reproduced on p. 122 of  that volume, stands by no means alone in certifying to the spreading  of the faith in the imperial palace. The name of Alexamenos, \"the  faithful,\" is repeated thrice. There is also a name, LIBANUS, under  which another hand has written EPISCOPUS, and, lower down, LIBANUS  EPI[SCOPUS]. It is very likely a joke on Libanus, a Christian page  like Alexamenos, whom his fellow-disciples had nicknamed \"the bishop.\"  It is true that the title is not necessarily Christian, having been  used sometimes to denote a municipal officer;[8] but this can hardly  be the case in an assembly of youths, like the one of the Domus  Gelotiana; and the connection between the _graffiti_ of Libanus and  those of Alexamenos seems evident. In reading these _graffiti_, now  very much injured by dampness, exposure, and the unscrupulous hands of  tourists, we are really witnessing household quarrels between pagan  and Christian dwellers in the imperial palace, in one of which  Caracalla, when still young, saw one of his playmates struck and  punished on account of his Christian origin and persuasion.    Septimius Severus and Caracalla issued a constitution,[9] which  opened to the Jews the way to the highest honors, making the  performance of such ceremonies as were in opposition to the principles  of their faith optional with them. What was granted to the Jews by the  law of the empire may have been permitted also to the Christians by  the personal benevolence of the emperors.    When Elagabalus collected, or tried to collect, in his own private  chapel the gods and the holiest relics of the universe, he did not  forget Christ and his doctrine.[10] Alexander Severus, the best of  Roman rulers, gave full freedom to the Church; and once, the  Christians having taken possession of a public place on which the  _popinarii_, or tavern-keepers, claimed rights, Alexander gave  judgment in favor of the former, saying it was preferable that the  _place_ should serve for divine worship, rather than for the sale of  drinks.[11]    [Illustration: Portrait Bust of Philip the Younger.]    There can scarcely be any doubt that the emperor Philip the Arab  (Marcus Julius Philippus, A. D. 244), his wife Otacilia Severa, and  his son Philip the younger were Christians, and friends of S.  Hippolytus. Still, in spite of these periods of peace and freedom of  the Church, we cannot be blind to the fact that for a Christian  nobleman wishing to make a career, the position was extremely  hazardous. Hence we frequently see baptism deferred until mature or  old age, and strange situations and even acts of decided apostasy  created by mixed marriages.    The wavering between public honors and Christian retirement is  illustrated by some incidents in the life of Licentius, a disciple of  S. Augustine. Licentius was the son of Romanianus, a friend and  countryman of Augustine; and when the latter retired to the villa of  Verecundus, after his conversion, in the year 386, Licentius, who had  attended his lectures on eloquence at Milan, followed him to his  retreat. He appears as one of the speakers in the academic disputes  which took place in the villa.[12] In 396, Licentius, who had followed  his master to Africa, seduced by the hopes of a brilliant career,  determined to settle in Rome. Augustine, deeply grieved at losing his  beloved pupil, wrote to call him back, and entreated him to turn his  face from the failing promises of the world. The appeal had no effect,  and no more had the epistles, in prose and verse, addressed to him for  the same purpose by Paulinus of Nola. Licentius, after finishing the  course of philosophy, being scarcely a catechumen, and a very unsteady  one at that, entered a career for public honors. Paulinus of Nola  describes him as aiming not only at a consulship, but also at a pagan  pontificate, and reproaches and pities him for his behavior. After  this, we lose sight of Licentius in history, but a discovery made at  S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura in December, 1862, tells us the end of the  tale. A marble sarcophagus was found, containing his body, and his  epitaph. This shows that Licentius died in Rome in 406, after having  reached the end of his desires, a place in the Senate; and that he  died a Christian, and was buried near the tomb of S. Lorenzo. This  sarcophagus, hardly noticed by visitors in spite of its great  historical associations, is preserved in the vestibule of the  Capitoline Museum.    [Illustration: Inscription found near the Porta del Popolo, 1877.]    As regards mixed marriages, a discovery made in 1877, near the Porta  del Popolo, has revealed a curious state of things. In demolishing one  of the towers by which Sixtus IV. had flanked that gate, we found a  fragment of an inscription of the second century, containing these  strange and enigmatic words: \"If any one dare to do injury to this  structure, or to otherwise disturb the peace of her who is buried  inside, because she, my daughter, has been [or has appeared to be] a  pagan among the pagans, and a Christian among the Christians\" ... Here  followed the specification of the penalties which the violator of the  tomb would incur. It was thought at first that the phrase _quod inter  fedeles fidelis fuit, inter alienos pagana fuit_ had been dictated by  the father as a jocose hint of the religious inconsistency of the  girl; but such an explanation can hardly be accepted. A passage of  Tertullian in connection with mixed marriages leads us to the true  understanding of the epitaph. In the second book Ad Uxorem, Tertullian  describes the state of habitual apostasy to which Christian girls  marrying gentiles willingly exposed or submitted themselves,  especially when the husband was kept in ignorance of the religion of  the bride. He mentions the risks they would incur of betraying their  conscience by accompanying their husbands to state or civil  ceremonies, thus sanctioning acts of idolatry by the mere fact of  their presence. In the book De Corona, he concludes his argument with  the words: \"These are the reasons why we do not marry infidels,  because such marriages lead us back to idolatry and superstition.\" The  girl buried on the Via Flaminia, by the modern Porta del Popolo, must  have been born of a Christian mother and a good-natured pagan father;  still, it seems hardly consistent with the respect which the ancients  had for tombs that he should be allowed to write such extraordinary  words on that of his own daughter.    We must not believe, however, that gentiles and Christians lived  always at swords' points. Italians in general, and Romans in  particular, are noted for their great tolerance in matters of  religion, which sometimes degenerates into apathy and indifference.  Whether it be a sign of feebleness of character, or of common sense,  the fact is, that religious feuds have never been allowed to prevail  among us. In no part of the world have the Jews enjoyed more freedom  and tolerance than in the Roman Ghetto. The same feelings prevailed in  imperial Rome, except for occasional outbursts of passion, fomented by  the official persecutors.    [Illustration: Inscription in a tomb of the Via Severiana at Ostia.]    An inscription was discovered at Ostia, in January, 1867, in a tomb of  the Via Severiana, of which I append an accurate copy.    The tomb and the inscription are purely pagan, as shown by the  invocation"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],[0,"Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#4)"],[1," 463 [mu][mu] and 469 [mu][mu], and the line at 501 [mu][mu]  characteristic of gaseous nebulae is sometimes present.    This type embraces mainly stars of relatively small apparent brightness.  The brightest is [gamma] Velorum with _m_ = 2.22. We shall find that the  absolute magnitude of these stars nearly coincides with that of the  stars of type B.    The type is grouped into five subdivisions represented by the letters  Oa, Ob, Oc, Od and Oe. These subdivisions are conditioned by the varying  intensities of the bright bands named above. The due sequence of these  sub-types is for the present an open question.    Among interesting stars of this type is [zeta] Puppis (Od), in the  spectrum of which PICKERING discovered a previously unknown series of  helium lines. They were at first attributed (by RYDBERG) to hydrogen and  were called \"additional lines of hydrogen\".    _Type B_ (Orion type, Helium stars). All lines are here dark. Besides  the hydrogen series we here find the He-lines (396, 403, 412, 414, 447,  471, 493 [mu][mu]).    To this type belong all the bright stars ([beta], [gamma], [delta],  [epsilon], [zeta], [eta] and others) in Orion with the exception of  Betelgeuze. Further, Spica and many other bright stars.    On plate III [epsilon] Orionis is taken as representative of this type.    _Type A_ (Sirius type) is characterized by the great intensity of the  hydrogen lines (compare plate III). The helium lines have vanished.  Other lines visible but faintly.    The greater part of the stars visible to the naked eye are found here.  There are 1251 stars brighter than the 6th magnitude which belong to  this type. Sirius, Vega, Castor, Altair, Deneb and others are all  A-stars.    _Type F_ (Calcium type). The hydrogen lines still rather prominent but  not so broad as in the preceding type. The two calcium lines H and K  (396.9, 393.4 [mu][mu]) strongly pronounced.    Among the stars of this type are found a great many bright stars  (compare the third chapter), such as Polaris, Canopus, Procyon.    _Type G_ (Sun type). Numerous metallic lines together with relatively  faint hydrogen lines.    To this class belong the sun, Capella, [alpha] Centauri and other bright  stars.    _Type K._ The hydrogen lines still fainter. The K-line attains its  maximum intensity (is not especially pronounced in the figure of plate  III).    This is, next to the A-type, the most numerous type (1142 stars) among  the bright stars.    We find here [gamma] Andromedae, [beta] Aquilae, Arcturus, [alpha]  Cassiopeiae, Pollux and Aldebaran, which last forms a transition to the  next type.    _Type M._ The spectrum is banded and belongs to SECCHI's third type. The  flutings are due to titanium oxide.    Only 190 of the stars visible to the naked eye belong to this type.  Generally they are rather faint, but we here find Betelgeuze, [alpha]  Herculis, [beta] Pegasi, [alpha] Scorpii (Antares) and most variables of  long period, which form a special sub-type _Md_, characterized by bright  hydrogen lines together with the flutings.    Type M has two other sub-types Ma and Mb.    _Type N_ (SECCHI's fourth type). Banded spectra. The flutings are due to  compounds of carbon.    Here are found only faint stars. The total number is 241. All are red.  27 stars having this spectrum are variables of long period of the same  type as Md.    The spectral types may be summed up in the following way:--        White stars:--SECCHI's type I:--Harvard B and A,      Yellow  \"  :--   \"      \"  II:--   \"    F, G and K,      Red     \"  :--   \"      \" III:--   \"    M,       \"      \"  :--   \"      \"  IV:--   \"    N.    The Harvard astronomers do not confine themselves to the types mentioned  above, but fill up the intervals between the types with sub-types which  are designated by the name of the type followed by a numeral 0, 1, 2,  ..., 9. Thus the sub-types between A and F have the designations A0, A1,  A2, ..., A9, F0, &c. Exceptions are made as already indicated, for the  extreme types O and M.      11. _Spectral index._ It may be gathered from the above description that  the definition of the types implies many vague moments. Especially in  regard to the G-type are very different definitions indeed accepted,  even at Harvard.[6] It is also a defect that the definitions do not  directly give _quantitative_ characteristics of the spectra. None the  less it is possible to substitute for the spectral classes a continuous  scale expressing the spectral character of a star. Such a scale is  indeed implicit in the Harvard classification of the spectra.    Let us use the term _spectral index_ (_s_) to define a number expressing  the spectral character of a star. Then we may conveniently define this  conception in the following way. Let A0 correspond to the spectral index  _s_ = 0.0, F0 to _s_ = +1.0, G0 to _s_ = +2.0, K0 to _s_ = +3.0 M0 to  _s_ = +4.0 and B0 to _s_ = -1.0. Further, let A1, A2, A3, &c., have the  spectral indices +0.1, +0.2, +0.3, &c., and in like manner with the  other intermediate sub-classes. Then it is evident that to all spectral  classes between B0 and M there corresponds a certain spectral index _s_.  The extreme types O and N are not here included. Their spectral indices  may however be determined, as will be seen later.    Though the spectral indices, defined in this manner, are directly known  for every spectral type, it is nevertheless not obvious that the series  of spectral indices corresponds to a continuous series of values of some  attribute of the stars. This may be seen to be possible from a  comparison with another attribute which may be rather markedly  graduated, namely the colour of the stars. We shall discuss this point  in another paragraph. To obtain a well graduated scale of the spectra it  will finally be necessary to change to some extent the definitions of  the spectral types, a change which, however, has not yet been  accomplished.      12. We have found in Sec.9 that the light-radiation of a star is described  by means of the total intensity (_I_), the mean wave-length ([lambda]_0)  and the dispersion of the wave-length ([sigma]_[lambda]). [lambda]_0 and  [sigma]_[lambda] may be deduced from the spectral observations. It must  here be observed that the observations give, not the intensities at  different wave-lengths but, the values of these intensities as they are  apprehended by the instruments employed--the eye or the photographic  plate. For the derivation of the true curve of intensity we must know  the distributive function of the instrument (L. M. 67). As to the eye,  we have reason to believe, from the bolometric observations of LANGLEY  (1888), that the mean wave-length of the visual curve of intensity  nearly coincides with that of the true intensity-curve, a conclusion  easily understood from DARWIN's principles of evolution, which demand  that the human eye in the course of time shall be developed in such a  way that the mean wave-length of the visual intensity curve does  coincide with that of the true curve ([lambda] = 530 [mu][mu]), when the  greatest visual energy is obtained (L. M. 67). As to the dispersion,  this is always greater in the true intensity-curve than in the visual  curve, for which, according to Sec.10, it amounts to approximately 60  [mu][mu]. We found indeed that the visual intensity curve is extended,  approximately, from 400 [mu][mu] to 760 [mu][mu], a sixth part of which  interval, approximately, corresponds to the dispersion [sigma] of the  visual curve.    In the case of the photographic intensity-curve the circumstances are  different. The mean wave-length of the photographic curve is,  approximately, 450 [mu][mu], with a dispersion of 16 [mu][mu], which is  considerably smaller than in the visual curve.      13. Both the visual and the photographic curves of intensity differ  according to the temperature of the radiating body and are therefore  different for stars of different spectral types. Here the mean  wave-length follows the formula of WIEN, which says that this  wave-length varies inversely as the temperature. The total intensity,  according to the law of STEPHAN, varies directly as the fourth power of  the temperature. Even the dispersion is dependent on the variation of  the temperature--directly as the mean wave-length, inversely as the  temperature of the star (L. M. 41)--so that the mean wave-length, as  well as the dispersion of the wave-length, is smaller for the hot stars  O and B than for the cooler ones (K and M types). It is in this manner  possible to determine the temperature of a star from a determination of  its mean wave-length ([lambda]_0) or from the dispersion in [lambda].  Such determinations (from [lambda]_0) have been made by SCHEINER and  WILSING in Potsdam, by ROSENBERG and others, though these researches  still have to be developed to a greater degree of accuracy.      14. _Effective wave-length._ The mean wave-length of a spectrum, or, as  it is often called by the astronomers, the _effective_ wave-length, is  generally determined in the following way. On account of the refraction  in the air the image of a star is, without the use of a spectroscope,  really a spectrum. After some time of exposure we get a somewhat round  image, the position of which is determined precisely by the mean  wave-length. This method is especially used with a so-called  _objective-grating_, which consists of a series of metallic threads,  stretched parallel to each other at equal intervals. On account of the  diffraction of the light we now get in the focal plane of the objective,  with the use of these gratings, not only a fainter image of the star at  the place where it would have arisen without grating, but also at both  sides of this image secondary images, the distances of which from the  central star are certain theoretically known multiples of the effective  wave-lengths. In this simple manner it is possible to determine the  effective wave-length, and "]]]
