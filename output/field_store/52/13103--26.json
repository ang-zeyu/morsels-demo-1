In nothing is it more plainly displayed than in the demand  for food products out of their natural season. An article which in its  season of abundance is a staple article of diet, within the means of all  but the very poorest, at its season of scarcity becomes a luxury which  only the wealthy can afford.    Before cold-storage methods had been brought to high efficiency, there  was a period in the latter part of the winter and the early spring when  young chickens were very scarce. The number that could be hatched with  hens to meet a demand at this season was small, and those who were  hatching autumn and winter chickens by the natural method found it more  profitable to keep them to sell as roasters late in the spring and early  in the summer.    =The \"broiler craze.\"= A little before 1890, artificial incubators being  then first brought to a perfection which made them popular, some poultry  keepers began to hatch chickens in the winter to meet the demand for  early broilers. Those who were successful made a very good profit on  what chickens they had ready to sell while the prices were high. Most of  them operated in a very small way, taking up this work simply for  occupation when they had nothing else to do. Many were gardeners who had  just about enough slack time, after the harvest of one year was over, to  hatch and grow one lot of broilers before beginning their regular spring  work.    These people were not under any delusions about the limitations on this  line of production. They knew that the demand for very small chickens at  very high prices was limited and easily satisfied. But, as usual, the  published accounts of what they were doing set a great many people to  figuring the possibilities of profit from such a business conducted on a  large scale. For a few years the broiler craze affected nearly every one  interested in poultry keeping. Thousands who never engaged in it were  restrained only because of lack of capital or inability to adapt it to  their circumstances. Many people who had been through several  unsatisfactory ventures in poultry keeping thought that they saw in this  the one sure road to wealth, and began to make plans to grow broilers in  large quantities. Besides these business ventures there were countless  small ones, sometimes conducted under the most unsuitable conditions.  People tried to grow broilers in living rooms, in attics, in all sorts  of unheated outbuildings, and in house cellars to which the daylight  hardly penetrated.    =Present condition of broiler growing.= The production of broilers as a  specialty did not last long. The improvement in cold-storage methods  soon made it possible for speculators to carry over large quantities of  summer chickens, and the poultry keepers in other lines could easily  arrange to produce all the fresh broilers that could be sold at a good  profit.      ROASTER GROWING    =Description of a good roaster.= To roast nicely, a fowl must be  full-grown and well filled out, but young, soft-meated, and fat. A fowl  is \"ripe\" for a choice roaster for only a short period after arriving at  maturity. When a pullet has laid a few eggs, her flesh becomes harder  and is never again as tender and juicy as it was before she laid an egg.  When the spurs of a cockerel begin to harden and to grow a long, sharp  point, and the bird becomes boisterous and quarrelsome, the flesh  becomes dry and tough and is not fit for roasting.    =General and special supplies.= From July, when the earliest farm  chickens are large enough for roasting, until about the first of  February, when the last of the late-hatched farm chickens disappear from  the markets, there are nearly always enough very good roasting chickens  in the general market receipts to supply the demand for that class and  grade of poultry. Then for four or five months there are no fresh  roasting chickens on the market except those grown especially for this  trade. This line of poultry culture was developed first near  Philadelphia, in southern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania, about  forty years ago. The chickens were hatched with hens in the autumn and  early winter, each grower having only a few hundred. They were sold not  only in Philadelphia but in New York and Boston, and in smaller Eastern  cities where there was a demand for them. They were, and still are,  commonly known as Philadelphia chickens.    [Illustration: Fig. 111. Massachusetts soft-roaster plant]    =Large roaster plants.= After incubators came into common use, the  production of Philadelphia chickens increased, but a more remarkable  development of that line of production took place in Plymouth County,  Massachusetts, just about the time the broiler craze started. The  growing of winter chickens had been carried on to some extent in  southern New England in the same way as in the vicinity of Philadelphia,  but the local supply was small and irregular until artificial methods  were adopted. Then, quite suddenly, the industry developed extensively  in the vicinity of Norwell, Hanover, and Rockland. Its growth was  remarkable, both because of the number of people who were successful on  a comparatively large scale, and because it attracted almost no  attention outside of this district until long after it had become a  well-established local industry.    [Illustration: Fig. 112. Incubator cellar]    The methods of the roaster growers in this district are very intensive,  but as originally developed their business was not a continuous line of  intensive poultry culture, nor is it continuous now except in some  cases. For many years after the business began, the growers bought the  eggs that they incubated from farmers whose flocks were kept under good  conditions and were strong and vigorous; but as the numbers engaged in  growing winter chickens increased, the supply of eggs from the farms was  not sufficient, and some of the roaster growers began to keep hens to  supply a part of the eggs they used. Later some produced all the eggs  for hatching that they needed for their own use, and a few sold to  others also. This, however, can be done only by those having quite large  farms. Some of the most successful growers have only a few acres of land  and do not attempt to keep breeding fowls.    Hatching begins in August or September and is continued until all the  chickens that can be handled are hatched. If the eggs hatch well from  the start, a large grower may have his houses full by December, but  usually it takes until January to complete hatching, and sometimes it  takes longer. The price paid for eggs for hatching is only a little  above the price of market eggs, and the buyer takes all the risks of  poor hatches. The chickens are kept in warm brooder houses as long as  they need artificial heat, then they are removed to cold brooder houses  of the same type or to colony houses. Those who have land enough use  mostly colony houses. While in the heated brooder houses the chickens  are fed in the regular way--with mixed ground grains, either dry or  moistened, and small whole or cracked grains. After they leave the  brooder houses they have cracked corn, beef scrap, and water always  before them; for green food they have cabbage or the winter rye or grass  growing on the land.    [Illustration: Fig. 113. House used for growing roasting chickens]    [Illustration: Fig. 114. Group of houses like that in Fig. 113]    As the object of the grower is to have chickens that will grow large and  remain soft as long as possible, the breeds used are principally Light  Brahmas and Plymouth Rocks, although when eggs of these varieties cannot  be obtained in sufficient quantities, Wyandottes are used. The cockerels  are caponized when they are about two months old. A capon does not grow  a comb or spurs, nor does it crow. If a perfect capon, it remains  always soft-meated and may grow very large, though it does not, as is  commonly supposed, grow larger than a cockerel within the time it is  usually kept before being killed. An imperfect capon will after a time  grow a comb and short spurs and, though sterile, becomes harder in flesh  than a perfect capon. An imperfect capon is technically called a _slip_.    [Illustration: Fig. 115. Petaluma egg farm. (Photograph from Bureau of  Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]    About the first of March some of the earliest pullets may begin to lay.  From that time all the pullets that begin to lay, and the slips as they  appear, are marketed; all others are kept, because the grower realizes  the largest profit on those that can be marketed in June and July, when  the price is highest. By the middle of July, at the latest, everything  is sold. The poultry keeper then begins to prepare for the next crop of  chickens by taking up all his fences, plowing land that is not in grass,  and planting it with winter rye or cabbage or some late garden crop. Rye  and cabbage are preferred, because the rye will remain green all winter  and furnish green food for chickens that have access to it, and the  cabbage makes the best of green food for the little chickens in the  brooder houses. It is just as good for the others, too, but not many of  the poultry keepers grow enough to continue feeding it to them  throughout the winter.    While the land on these plants is heavily stocked with poultry, the  birds are on it only half of the season,--when vegetation grows  freely,--and during the remainder of the season a great deal of manure  is removed from the soil by gross-feeding crops like rye and cabbage. So  the land may be heavily stocked longer than it could be if fowls were on  it all the time. The chickens grown in this way do not usually grow so  large as those that are given more room, but they are grown at less cost  and are as large as the market demands. By this method the land will  carry a large crop of chickens year"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34479"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 1 (of 6) (#19)"],[1,"the new  Italian manner in the court of Spain, and returned to Florence with  honour and with affluence. The first remained to enjoy them in his  native country, until the time of his death: the latter returned back to  increase them; and, according to Vasari, he left no public work in  Florence, except an historic design of Isaac, in green earth, in a  cloister of the church of S. Maria Novella: perhaps he ought to have  said, that he left various works, for several are there visible, all in  the same taste, and so rude, as to induce us to reckon him rather a  follower of Buffalmacco than of Giotto. But he excelled in small pieces;  and there was none then living who could more elegantly ornament  cabinets, coffers, the backs of couches, or other household furniture,  with subjects from history and fable.    Among the disciples of Taddeo Gaddi I have named Jacopo del Casentino,  of whom there are some remains in the church of Orsanmichele. Jacopo  taught Spinello Aretino, a man of a most lively fancy, as may be  gathered from some of his pictures in Arezzo, no less than from his  life. He painted also at Florence, and was one of those who had the  honour of ornamenting the Campo Santo of Pisa with historical paintings.  His pictures of the martyrs S. Petito and S. Epiro, are noticed by  Vasari as his best performances. He was, however, inferior to his  competitors by the meanness of his design, and the style of his  colouring, in which green and black are predominant, without being  sufficiently relieved by other colours. The fall of the angels still  remains in S. Angelo at Arezzo, in which Lucifer is represented so  terrible, that it afterwards haunted the dreams of the artist, and,  deranging both his mind and body, hastened his death. Bernardo Daddi was  his scholar; a man less known in his own country than at Florence, where  he executed a picture, seen on the gate of San Giorgio (See Moreni, lib.  v. p. 5.); as was also Parri, the son of Spinello, who modernised his  style somewhat on the manner of Masolino. The latter excelled in the art  of colouring, but he was barbarous in the drawing of his figures, which  he made extravagantly long and bending, in order, as he was used to say,  to give them greater spirit. One may see some remains of them at Arezzo  in S. Domenico, and other places. Lorenzo di Bicci of Florence, another  scholar of Spinello, was the Vasari of his time, for the multiplicity,  celerity, and easy self-complacency, shewn in his labours. The first  cloister of the church of S. Croce retains several specimens, consisting  of the legends of S. Francis; and there is an Assumption on the front,  in which he was assisted by Donatello, while still a young man. Perhaps  his best work is the fresco, ornamenting the sanctuary of S. Maria  Nuova, built by Martin V. about the year 1418. His son Neri is reckoned  among the last followers of Giotto. He lived but a short time; he left,  in S. Romolo, a picture which would not have disgraced his father, and  which is certainly more carefully executed than was usual with the  latter.    During the fourteenth century, sculpture was cultivated at Pisa by as  many artists as painting was at Florence; but Pisa was not on that  account destitute of painters worthy of being recorded. Vasari mentions  one Vicino, who finished the mosaic begun by Turrita, assisted by Tafi  and Gaddi, and adds, that he was also a painter. Sig. da Morrona says,  that he retained the old style of his school; which was the case with  many others, as appears from several old Madonnas upon panels, both of  anonymous and of ascertained painters. Of this sort is that in the old  church of Tripalle, and that at S. Matthew's in Pisa. On the first is  this inscription, _Nerus Nellus de Pisa me pinxit_, 1299: on the second  we read, _Jacopo di Nicola dipintore detto Gera mi dipinse_. The mode of  expression is derived from the m'epoiese of the Greeks; to which the old  Pisans closely adhered in their paintings, their sculptures, and their  bronzes.[67] Like the other Italians they at length reformed their  style, and there, as well as at Florence and Siena, families of painters  arose, in which the fathers were excelled by their sons, and they by  their children. Thus, from Vanni, who flourished in 1300, sprung Turino  di Vanni, who flourished about 1343, and Nello di Vanni, who painted in  the Campo Santo, whose son Bernardo was the disciple of Orcagna, and  furnished many pictures for the palace of the primate. There was also in  that city one Andrea di Lippo, who is noticed in the _Academical  Discourse on the literary history of Pisa_, in the year 1336; the same,  I believe, with that Andrea da Pisa, mentioned among the artists that  ornamented the cathedral of Orvieto in 1346. A work by one Giovanni di  Niccolo remains in the monastery of S. Martha, and, perhaps, he painted  the fine trittico of the Zelada museum at Rome, which represents our  Saviour with S. Stephen, S. Agatha, and other saints, and which has this  inscription, _Jo. de Pisis pinxit_. This is a picture of great labour,  by some ascribed to Gio. Balducci; which, if it was ascertained, would  confer honour on that great man, as a professor of the three sister  arts. Towards the end of the century the power of the Pisans declined,  rather from civil discord than from other misfortunes; till at length  the city fell into the hands of the Florentines in 1406, and lay for a  long time prostrate and humbled, deprived, not only of her artists, but  almost of her citizens; and fully glutted the ancient hatred of her  hostile neighbours. She at length rose again, not, indeed, to command,  but to more dignified subjection.    The spirit of the Florentines in the mean time increasing with their  power, they became chiefly solicitous to suit the magnificence of their  capital to the grandeur of the state. Cosmo, at once the father of his  country and of men of genius, gave stability to public affairs. Lorenzo  the Magnificent, and others of the house of Medici, followed, whose  hereditary taste for literature and the fine arts is celebrated in a  multitude of books, and most copiously in the histories written by three  eminent authors, Monsignor Fabroni, the Signor Ab. Galluzzi, and Mr.  Roscoe. Their house was at once a lyceum for philosophers, an arcadia  for poets, and an academy for artists. Dello, Paolo, Masaccio, the two  Peselli, both the Lippi, Benozzo, Sandro, the Ghirlandai, enjoyed the  perpetual patronage of this family, and as constantly rendered it  whatever honour they could bestow. Their pictures are full of portraits,  according to the custom of the times, and continually presented to the  people the likenesses of the Medici, and often represented them with  regal ornaments in their pictures of the Epiphany, as if gradually to  prepare the people to behold the sceptre and royal robe securely  established in that house. The good taste of the Medici was seconded by  that of other citizens, who were then distributed into various  corporations, according to their place of residence and profession, each  of which strove with reciprocal emulation to decorate their houses and  their churches. Besides the desire of public ornament, they were  animated by religion, which, in what relates to divine worship, is so  widely spread, not only among the great, but also among the lower orders  of people, that those have a difficulty in believing who have not beheld  it. Their cathedral, a vast fabric, was already reared for the  ceremonies of religion, and here and there some other churches arose;  these and the more ancient, in emulation of each other, they adorned  with paintings, a luxury unknown to their ancestors, and less common in  the other cities of Italy. This disposition gave rise, after the  conclusion of the century, to that prodigious number of painters already  mentioned; and hence sprang, in the century we now treat of, that crowd  of artists in marble, bronze, and silver, who transferred pre-eminence  in sculpture, the ancient inheritance of the Pisans, to the people of  Florence. The Florentines were desirous of ornamenting the new cathedral  and baptistery, the church of Orsanmichele, and other sacred places,  with statues and basso-relievos. These brought forward Donatello,  Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Filarete, Rossellini, Pollajuoli, and  Verrocchio, and produced those noble works in marble, in bronze, and in  silver, which sometimes appear to have attained the perfection of the  art, and to have rivalled the ancients. The rising generation was  instructed in design by those celebrated men, and the universality of  the principles they taught, made the transition from one art to another  easy. The same individuals were often statuaries, founders in bronze, in  gold, lapidaries, painters, or architects, talents that appear enviable  to this age, in which an artist with difficulty acquires a competent  knowledge in a single art. Such was the course of instruction at  Florence in the Studies, and such the subsequent encouragement without,  from which it will not appear wonderful to the reader that this city was  the foremost to attain the perfection of the art. But let us trace the  steps by which it advanced in Florence, and in the rest of Italy.    The followers of Giotto had now carried painting beyond the period of  its infancy, but it continued to give proofs of its infant faculties,  especially in chiaroscuro, and still more in perspective. Figures  sometimes appeared as if falling or slipping from the canvass; buildings  had not a true point of view; and the art of foreshortening was yet very  rude. Stefano Fiorentino perceived rather than removed the difficulty;  others for the most part sought either to avoid or to compensate for the  deficiency. Pietro della Francesca, whom we have elsewhere noticed,  appears to have been the first who revived the Grecian practice of  rendering geometry"]]]
