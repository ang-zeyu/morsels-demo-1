In 1908 Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell brought 300 Lapland Reindeer to  Newfoundland. After some years they were transferred to the north shore  of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and finally to the island of Anticosti.  (Hewitt, 1921: 324-328; Seton, 1929, +3+: 92.) In 1911, 50 of these  Reindeer were shipped from Newfoundland to the Slave River region. Most  of them escaped (probably to contaminate the local stock of Caribou),  and by 1916 the last survivor of this band in captivity had succumbed  (Hewitt, 1921: 329-330).    \"A large part of the reindeer in Alaska are south of the Arctic Circle  on the comparatively mild shores of Bering Sea, where there are several  months of open tidewater navigation; vegetation is more luxuriant [than  in Arctic Canada] and conditions easier in general. There the reindeer  were introduced into a country where the wild caribou had been virtually  exterminated, and a large native population were anxious to take up a  new mode of support. The percentage of profits has appeared unduly large  in Alaska because statisticians have been unable to take into account  the value of the services of a large body of devoted missionaries,  government teachers, and other unselfish persons who put their best  efforts into years of unpaid extra work to make the reindeer successful  and beneficial to their charges.    \"Canada has a large area of Arctic and sub-arctic lands beyond the reach  of possible cultivation, still occupied by large numbers of wild caribou  and remnants of musk-oxen, with native inhabitants who derive a living  from them and add to the national wealth by fur production. These  Indians and Eskimos are still far from being either able or willing to  enter upon a pastoral stage of existence, and moreover, they are now  enjoying an era of prosperity from the fur industry which may be  temporary, but which they will not relinquish for the slower and less  profitable prospects of the herder.\" (R. M. Anderson, 1924: 330-331.)    In 1921 some Norwegian Reindeer were landed at Amadjuak, Baffin Island  (Seton, 1929, +3+: 92). The lack of further reference to the Baffin  Island animals by such subsequent investigators as Manning and Soper  would seem to indicate that the reindeer have not survived, unless  through mixture with the native Caribou. An attempt in 1922 at  acclimatization in Michigan \"ended in total failure\" (Seton, 1929, +3+:  93).    \"The Barren Grounds . . . still feed enormous herds of caribou. . . .  The greatest danger to this industry [reindeer-raising] is just these  wild herds, which would be very apt to absorb the tame animals. This  problem may perhaps become a fatal one to the Eskimos, for there might  very easily come a most difficult transitional period, when the caribou  would be too few in numbers to form a definite basis for the existence  of the people, but on the other hand numerous enough to make reindeer  breeding difficult.\" (Birket-Smith, 1933: 121.)    In northwestern Alaska \"large numbers of reindeer are constantly  escaping the herders and joining the wild caribou. It seems that it will  be but a short time until there will be no pure bred caribou along that  part of the coast. . . . As the reindeer are protected, and the caribou  are killed at every opportunity, the former will doubtless prove the  dominant animal and in time overcome the caribou, with hybridization the  inevitable result.\" (Bailey and Hendee, 1926: 22.)    \"The caribou's greatest menace is not the wolf, nor the hunter, but  man's economic developments, principally the raising of reindeer.  Wherever reindeer herds are introduced, caribou must of course  disappear, for both cannot occupy the same range. The disappearance of  the caribou along the Bering Sea and Arctic coasts, while regrettable,  was unavoidable in view of the development of reindeer herding in this  section, which is ideal for the purpose. . . .    \"The mingling of reindeer with the main caribou herds should be avoided.  Reindeer herds maintained in close contact with migrating caribou suffer  frequent losses through strays. Already the domestic reindeer are  mingling with the caribou herd of Mount McKinley National Park. . . .  [Hybridization] would be regrettable in interior Alaska, which has  produced a splendid type of wild caribou, coming near at least to being  the largest on the continent.\" (Murie, 1935: 7.)    Murie's extensive experience with these animals in Alaska has led him to  remark further (1939: 245):    \"The greatest hazard to the Caribou is the possible occupation of the  range by man's agricultural activities. . . . The most serious danger is  introduction of domesticated Reindeer on wild Caribou range, for the  wild herds must be removed in order to make possible the safe herding of  the domestic animals. . . . There is not room for both of these animals  on the same or closely adjacent ranges.\"    Porsild points out (1943: 386, 389) that sparsely covered grazing areas  are suitable for Caribou but not for Reindeer; and that the former  disappear before expanding Reindeer culture.    \"Perhaps the worst threat of all to the caribou has been the  introduction of reindeer culture along the arctic coast. This has  resulted in interbreeding between the wild caribou and their inferior  domesticated relatives. When and if this mixture extends to all the  herds of the Barren Grounds, the caribou may be written off the record  as a pure species; the animal will have become extinct through dilution,  as the biologists express it.\" (Harper, 1949: 239.)    The American Society of Mammalogists, at its annual meeting in 1950,  passed the following resolution (_Jour. Mammalogy_ +31+ (4): 483, 1950):    \"That the American Society of Mammalogists urges that the Canadian  Government not undertake the introduction of reindeer into Ungava.  Before any introduction even is seriously considered, those persons  involved in any planning are urged to make a thorough study beforehand  of the problems of integrating lichen ecology, reindeer biology, and  native culture--serious problems that have not been solved to date on  any workable scale on the North American continent. It would be  particularly deplorable if an introduction, to aid the natives, led to  early successes and high hopes, then eventual failure.\"    Porsild, who knows the Reindeer thoroughly at first hand, has made  (1951: 53) the following observation:    \"Thus far these experiments [at introduction into America] have met with  only partial or indifferent success, because reindeer nomadism is  incompatible with present trends of cultural development and because the  North American Arctic is too thinly populated to provide a ready market  for reindeer products.\"    Referring to the region of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska, Rausch  says (1951: 190):    \"The mixture of inferior reindeer bloodlines with the native caribou is  serious. This has already occurred to a considerable degree, and it is  hoped that proper control will be exercised if the reindeer industry is  revived in Alaska. Ear-notched animals have been killed in the Anaktuvuk  Pass country, and white reindeer have been seen running with the  caribou. The number of unrecognized reindeer passing through could be  great.\"    At present the Barren Ground Caribou is apparently the third most  abundant member of the deer family on our continent, being exceeded by  the White-tailed Deer and the Mule Deer (_cf._ Jackson, 1944: 7-8). No  other member of this family could be expected to be so eminently and  thoroughly adapted to its Arctic environment or to thrive so well on the  very ground where nature has been molding and perfecting its characters  for thousands of years. No naturally occurring relative--Moose, Deer, or  Woodland Caribou--undertakes to compete with it on its own particular  range. It requires practically nothing for the maintenance--and  increase--of its present numbers, other than an enlightened policy of  conservation. (As indicated on a previous page, the feminine wearers of  Arctic Fox furs must bear a heavy share of responsibility for the  decline of the Barren Ground Caribou in recent decades.) Our highest  authorities have pointed out the impracticability of Caribou and  Reindeer occupying the same range.    Would it not be the part of wisdom to exclude the inferior domesticated  alien, with its difficult and generally unsuccessful culture in North  America, and thereby to give the wonderful wild Caribou of the Barrens  its best chance for survival?      _References._--Chambers, 1914: 350-351; Hornaday, 1914, +2+:    105-108; Hewitt, 1921: 323, 329-330; R. M. Anderson, 1924: 330;    Kindle, 1928: 74; Seton, 1929, +3+: 92-93; Blanchet, 1930:    53-54; Birket-Smith, 1933: 121; Godsell, 1934: 276; Murie,    1935: 7, 1939: 245-246, and 1941: 435; Porsild, 1943: 386, 389;    Rousseau, 1948: 96; Harper, 1949: 239; Polunin, 1949: 24;    Lantis, 1950; Hustich, 1951; Porsild, 1951: 53; Rausch, 1951:    190; Scheffer, 1951.          NUMERICAL STATUS      There seems to be a general impression, among those who have known the  Barren Ground Caribou at first hand for a considerable period, that the  population has been reduced by something like a half during the past  generation. \"Recent preliminary aerial survey has indicated that their  numbers, although less than the previous estimates of 3,000,000 (R. M.  Anderson, 1938; Clarke, 1940), which were based upon the carrying  capacity of the Arctic tundra, are probably comparable to their  primitive numbers in the central portions of the range\" (Banfield, 1949:  478). A definite reduction is indicated along the Arctic coast and on  the Arctic islands (R. M. Anderson, 1937: 103, and 1938: 400; Banfield,  1949: 478, 481, and 1951a: 13-14).

A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#19)"],[1,"were made on the river bank for toilet articles,            nails placed for towels, etc., and saplings formed            as a screen for fear of a chance fisherman or game            protector passing by. On the other side of the            island a place was made for washing dishes.              Camp made, we were free to go fishing. So taking a            can of unsalted salmon eggs in our pockets, our            rods, and a v-shaped twig to carry our fish on, we            were off until lunch.              We all assist in making and cleaning up after this            meal. Then an hour of rest is followed by fishing,            learning woodcraft methods of various kinds, or            anything that we may choose to do. Dinner was            prepared while there was still daylight, and then            the best part of camp life began--telling stories            around the fire, studying the stars and singing to            the accompaniment of mandolin and ukulele, always            carried on a trip of this kind.              The large tarpaulins brought are for emergency            only, in case of a thunderstorm. Such occurring we            gather all our beds together into one row and the            tarpaulin is placed over them, under which we lie            until the storm is over. By crawling out carefully            we can gather up tarpaulin and shake it out away            from our bedding and thus we can keep dry without            the shelter of cabin, tent or lean-to.              This is a general routine of a short roughing trip            in the deep mountain forests of North Western            Washington.              The only addition necessary for the ordinary Girl            Scout equipment for a week-end hike is fishing            rods and tackle.

CAMP HEALTH AND CAMP SAFETY              _Ye, use ... this medicine             Every day this May or thou dine,             Go looke upon the fresh daisie             And though thou be for wo in point to die,             That shall full greatly lessen thee of thy pine._                                          --_Chaucer_      1. CAMP SANITATION    Too great stress cannot be laid upon the question of sanitation. Make  the camp safe if you would have a healthful, happy camp, and keep it  orderly if you would keep it safe. The time to make the camp safe is  before and during the process of building and prior to each camp season  if an old camp is used. Certain known things are fore-runners of trouble  and should be avoided or safeguarded against from the start. Among these  are low, damp ground, impure water, an insufficient supply of water,  unsafe bathing conditions, such as deep water only, a very swift  current, undertow, shallow water and a quick drop, holes, and so forth;  proximity to pest breeding places such as pools of stagnant water,  marshes where mosquitoes breed, uncared-for out houses, barns, and  dumps; inadequate latrine facilities, and so forth.    The keeping of the camp safe is a daily matter which includes the  disposal of all waste, the cleaning of the camp grounds and all  buildings, the inspection of the water supply, provisions, equipment,  the latter in a general way, the guarding against pests of any kind and  the personal health of the campers.      Disposition of Trash    Every morning all trash should be collected and properly disposed of.  Burning is the only method unless arrangements have been made to have  all dry waste carted away. For burning light trash use a small  incinerator two feet high and eighteen inches in diameter, made of iron,  and with a cover circular in shape and perforated closely with holes  half an inch in diameter. When in use the incinerator should stand in an  open place away from all tents and buildings. The heavier trash, such as  old shoes, paste-board boxes, discarded clothing, should be burned in a  heap away from all buildings, care being taken that no bits of hot paper  cause grass fires, or blow into the woods.    [Illustration: \"OVER THE TOP\"]    Wooden boxes in which provisions are shipped can be split up for  kindling wood, or if the boxes are large and well made, kept for packing  equipment for storage. Some of the well-made boxes are very serviceable  to use as seats, and one could be placed in the kitchen to hold wood.  Butter tubs, if washed and dried, can be used to hold vegetables or  other provisions. Barrels should never be thrown away if in good  condition. They are invaluable when packing dishes or kitchen ware and  during the summer will hold sacks of provisions such as cereal, rice,  hominy, beans, and so forth.    All tin cans should be rinsed out as soon as emptied, burned on the  trash heap and when cold thrown into a covered pit, or into covered  barrels to be carted away at the end of the season.      Garbage    There are three ways of disposing of garbage when in camp. Burn it, bury  it, give it away. Sometimes all three ways are necessary in one camp. If  the group is small and there is little garbage it can be thrown around  the edge of a hot fire and when dried out, raked onto the hot coals.    In larger camps a portable incinerator can be used. One form has a basin  over the fire pot, into which garbage is placed to be dried out and then  turned into the fire.    In camps of 100 or more people where burning is difficult, pits for  burying garbage have been found satisfactory if properly cared for and  dug not near the camp buildings or source of water supply. They should  be deep, oblong in shape, and the earth should be thrown up at one side  to be used in covering the garbage as soon as it is thrown into the pit.    In a camp where there is no plumbing, liquid waste as well as garbage,  can be disposed of in the following way. Dig a trench four feet long,  two feet deep and thirty inches wide at one end; eight inches wide and  level with the ground at the other end; line with stone, or if this is  impossible, use tin, sheet iron, or brick. Put the garbage into the  trench, build a fire on top of it, when the fire is very hot pour the  liquid waste into the trench at the small end. If there is a great deal  of garbage some of it will have to be put on top of the fire which  should be made of heavy logs of hard wood. Tin cans can be burnt in this  fire and then treated as stated before.    The disposing of camp garbage is not a difficult matter if some system  and care are used. It is necessary to have a covered pail near the  kitchen door for use during the day. The contents of this pail should be  burned or buried every night after supper and if necessary once during  the day, preferably after dinner. If this pail is lined with two or  three thicknesses of newspaper each time after emptying, it will be kept  in good condition.    If garbage is to be carted out of camp, have proper receptacles for  transporting it and do not let too much accumulate at any one time.    Under no circumstances allow waste food to be strewn on the ground  anywhere within camp limits, or the ground around the garbage pail, pit  or incinerator to be untidy.    One of the best disinfectants for latrines and garbage pits is  smouldering tar paper. Break the paper into small pieces, throw into the  latrine or pit, light and let smoulder.      Pests    At least twice a week camp grounds should be thoroughly inspected to  make sure that there are no pest breeding places such as pools of  stagnant water, old tin cans in which water will collect, trash heaps,  and so forth. It is much easier to keep flies and mosquitoes away by  doing away with such places, than it is to exterminate them after they  have come in large numbers. If camp grounds and buildings are cleaned  every day and all waste properly disposed of, there is little danger of  trouble from pests.    In localities where mosquitoes and flies are very troublesome other  precautions should be taken. It might be necessary to have mosquito  netting over the cots at night and fly paper in the kitchen and store  closet. A piece of absorbent cotton saturated in citronella and hung on  the tent poles at either end of the tent will sometimes keep mosquitoes  away as they dislike intensely any strong odor.    If ants get into the kitchen or store closets borax sprinkled on the  shelves will often send them away, or if they are very troublesome  dishes of food can be stood in pans of water.      Water Supply    An adequate water supply is most essential for any camp, and should be  one of the first things to be considered in selecting a site. Springs  and wells generally supply the camper with drinking water; lakes and  streams with wash water. Few springs or wells can supply enough water  for all purposes when a camp is large.    Whatever the source of supply the drinking water should be tested by the  Health authorities before camp opens, and at any time there is any  question concerning it. Springs and wells should be cleaned out and the  former protected with boards or screening if necessary.    Too much thought cannot be given to the question of the water, as to its  purity and quantity. Children drink a great deal in hot weather and much  has to be used for cooking and washing. If there is any danger of the  drinking supply giving out, to prevent waste, allow only one or two  people to draw water and then only when necessary.    Keep covered tanks or coolers of drinking water in shady places,  convenient for the campers. Caution all as to wastefulness and if in  case of an emergency there is only a very little, place a counsellor in  charge of it and deal it out by the cupful, seeing that all have an  equal share. Of course, only individual cups should be used.    Should there be any doubt as to the purity of the water, boil it for  twenty minutes, place in earthenware or agate vessels, cool, cover and  lower the vessels down"]]]
