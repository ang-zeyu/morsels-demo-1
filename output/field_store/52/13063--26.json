[26] F. meliacea is also known as tikug in Samar but it cannot be  used in weaving.    [27] In pulling up tikug the whole stalk can generally be obtained  by grasping it a short distance below the top. It is made into small  bundles and tied a short distance below the seed heads. Each bundle  contains from forty to sixty straws. In all towns except Basey  the weavers gather the stalks they use. At Basey, however, where  weaving of mats is a recognized industry, the straw is obtained from  country people who make it a business to gather and sell it. These  tikug vendors carry the bundles of green straw to the town, where  they sell for from forty centavos to one peso per hundred bundles,  depending upon the length of the straws.    [28] The high cost of these dyes results from the adulteration  practiced and the exorbitant profits, usually about 450 per cent. It  is expected that the new dyes obtained from Germany through the Bureau  of Education will make a saving of about 80 per cent to the workers.    [29] The following story is reported as showing the cleverness of  the weavers of Basey in embroidering designs on mats. An engineer in  charge of road construction refused to buy certain mats from a vendor  but stated, jokingly, and in order to be rid of the insistent merchant,  that if he were brought mats having designs which were of interest to  him, as showing scenes connected with his work, he would buy them. In  a few weeks the broker returned, bringing with him a large mat on which  were displayed a road roller, wheel barrows, shovels, spades and other  implements connected with road building, and part of a road itself.    [30] In general it may be stated that the sabutan and tikug mats are  the strongest made in the Philippines. Neither the wearing qualities  of the straw nor the permanency of the dyes in buri mats are equal  to those of tikug. If tikug floor mats become dirty they may be  cleaned without injury if the dyeing was well done. They should be  shaken to remove dust and dirt, laid flat on the floor and lightly  scrubbed with a cloth, sponge or brush, using lukewarm soapsuds,  after which cold water should be thrown on them. They are dried by  hanging in the sunshine or the breeze.    [31] A firm has recently entered the field and is doing a mail order  business in these mats with the United States. Their plans include  the furnishing of straw and dyes to the weavers and the weaving of  standard designs.    [32] Most of the information given under this heading was taken from  reports by Percy M. Jones and Frank Thomason, formerly supervising  teachers of Bohol.    [33] Circular No. 82, s. 1911, Bureau of Education.    [34] Based on original designs by Mrs. Alice Brezina.    [35] Three units will take up about 3 times 17, or 51 straws. In  starting, a curved pattern 51 straws across will have to be made and  slipped up or down in a sixteenth division of the mat in order that  the margin space may be determined.    [36] This design, in all cases except where G S is 8 instead of 5,  would look well with the outer border line broadened to the edge of  the mat. This is a suggestion only; it means a great deal of work.    [37] Weave large solid parts of designs first, when possible, and  slight mistakes of one or two straws, which may happen, will then occur  in open parts where they will show very little. Mistakes of this kind  are only allowable in cases of flaws in the mat which is used.              BUREAU OF EDUCATION PUBLICATIONS.

Although the singer may be quite unaware of the  science underlying the fact, it will be found that the quality of the  voice at the bottom of its range as these vowels are sung is very  different from that at the top of the range, the alterations taking  place in almost imperceptible gradations. By reference to the foregoing  pages of this book it will be seen that the late Emil Behnke attached  great importance to vowel training, and exemplifications of his methods  are to be found in \"Voice Training Exercises\" and \"Voice Training  Studies\" written in conjunction with C. W. Pearce, Mus.Doc. The subject  is also fully explained in \"Voice, Song, and Speech,\" by Lennox Browne,  F.R.C.S., and Emil Behnke; and the whole matter is most ably discussed  in \"Pronunciation for Singers,\" by the late Dr. A. J. Ellis, F.R.S.,  published by Messrs Curwen & Sons.    In thus strongly advocating education of the resonator in the production  of vowel sounds in singing, let me not be supposed to ignore the  necessity for also cultivating pronunciation of consonants, which have  been termed the checks and stops of sound.    Clearness of enunciation and purity of pronunciation, which are great  aids to the voice, and possess a charm all their own, depend upon both  vowels and consonants being accurately rendered.    The English are the worst enunciators of all European peoples, and their  custom is to lay the blame on the language, than which none other is  deemed by them so unvocal. There is, however, a vast amount of sonority  and musical charm in our grand and noble language, second only to the  Italian, when properly spoken.    The cultivation of pure, accurate, and refined pronunciation in speech  will greatly facilitate good enunciation in singing, and should he  sedulously acquired; for there are numbers of vocalists who leave us in  doubt as to whether the words they sing are English, French, Italian, or  German; while the number of those who mispronounce words in a deplorable  manner is legion.      FORCING THE REGISTERS.    The next factor which has much to do with voice failure is forcing the  registers beyond their proper point of change. The erroneous belief  appears to exist that, by carrying up the registers a few notes beyond  their natural limits, the tones thus produced are fuller and richer. But  if in training a voice this practice be followed the result will be  serious injury to the vocal organ.    This is not a theoretical statement; we can easily see with the  laryngoscope the great amount of congestion of the vocal ligaments  immediately caused by thus forcing up a register; and not only are these  affected by the strain put upon them, but the whole interior of the  throat becomes blood-red, and looks irritated and inflamed. As soon as  the change to the right register is made the vocal apparatus returns to  its normal state.    Now we all know the effects of undue strain on muscles in other parts of  the body, and have felt the pain and weakness arising therefrom; but far  worse results follow the damage to the throat caused by the strain of  forcing up the registers, by both speakers and singers. The quality of  the voice becomes impaired, and actual loss of notes follows. In some  extreme cases which I have had under my care, there has been entire  absence of voice both in speaking and in singing, and much suffering has  been experienced from granular inflammation of the throat brought on by  this faulty voice use.    Another method of forcing the voice is the almost universal endeavour to  acquire \"top notes\" which do not belong to the singer's compass. Because  of the high notes in some voices exceptionally endowed by nature, it  seems as though all singers, no matter what their natural range, have  made it the one object of their training to strive after a vocal  attainment whose rarity appears to be almost its only justification to  be considered as an artistic merit. Why should these ever vanishing  \"top notes\" be so much craved and striven for? Can it be said that, as  regards each individual voice, these notes are higher in a scale of  excellence than the rest? What merit does their acquisition promise as a  set-off to the deterioration of the voice and its inevitable ultimate  failure? A high note, _per se_, is not necessarily \"a thing of beauty\"  to the listener, while the result of its attainment is often the  converse of a \"joy for ever\" to the singer; for in those cases of  forcing up the voice above its natural compass, violence is done to the  throat, which in time results in some of the many ailments peculiar to  singers who use faulty methods. The middle range of the voice becomes  proportionately weaker and thinner as the cult of the extra \"top notes\"  becomes greater, until the anomalous position is reached of a voice with  two ends and no middle; while these superadded, artificial, high notes  are wanting in timbre, in purity, in strength, and in ease. It is easily  demonstrable by the laryngoscope that the forced and strained action of  the vocal ligaments, and of other laryngeal and throatal muscular  action, exercises an injurious influence upon the voice. The endeavour  to sing notes beyond the extreme of the compass, or notes which do not  naturally lie within any one register--particularly the chest  register--causes great fatigue of the tensor muscles of the vocal  ligaments, and serious congestion, extending to the windpipe and pharynx  has, in many cases, followed this practice.    More time and energy are devoted to the acquirement of what the late  Emil Behnke called \"mere acrobatic skill\" than is given to the purely  artistic side of voice use, and it follows that we get \"the survival  _not_ of the fittest\" but rather of those with exceptionally strong  physical organisations, instead of refined artists.    The deterioration throughout the whole compass of the voice is often  painfully noticeable during an entire song, but the forcible shouting of  a full, high-pitched note at its close seems to be intended to  compensate for all the misery previously endured by the sensitive  listener.    Now the maintenance of a healthy condition of the vocal muscles depends  to a great degree upon the right use of those muscles in the formation  of tone. There should never be any feeling of fatigue, strain, pricking,  tightness, aching, or of pain in the throat, nor yet of huskiness after  vocal practice. The method of voice use which produces such results, or  any one of them, is wrong. Nature is pointing out as forcibly as  possible the injury which is being done. Her warning should be heeded  before conditions, getting worse, lead up to the sad ailments from which  so many suffer, and which are disastrous to both voice and health.    The foregoing facts and illustrations force upon us the conclusion that  the large majority of throat affections from which both speakers and  singers suffer might be entirely prevented by correct methods of voice  use. As prevention is proverbially better than cure, it must be  infinitely more advantageous to acquire correct methods than to unlearn  bad ones which exercise a deleterious influence, always recognisable  even when entire voice failure has not followed their practice.          _APPENDIX TO THE TENTH EDITION_      DOES DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING APPLY EQUALLY TO WOMEN AS TO MEN?      In a kind notice of the first edition of this brochure, which appeared  in _The Medical Press_, the editor raises the above question. He says:  \"The evils attending faulty methods of voice-production are pointed out  both from an anatomical and from an artistic point of view,  diaphragmatic breathing being especially insisted on in opposition to  mere clavicular breathing. This is undoubtedly correct; but we think the  advice here embodied would have been even more valuable had the  authoress mentioned if from her experience she thought it applied in an  equal extent to both sexes, as it is well known that nature, or we may  perhaps more correctly say, the art of dress, causes women to breathe in  a far more 'clavicular manner' than men.\"    This is a valuable criticism, and as the point indicated is likely to be  of interest to many persons, I append my reply, which appeared in the  next number of _The Medical Press_:--    \"To the Editor of the _Medical Press and Circular_.    \"SIR,--I intended the advice on breathing to apply to both sexes,  diaphragmatic breathing with perfect control being the foundation of all  good voice-production, whether in speaking or in singing, in men and  women alike, while clavicular breathing is a potent factor in  voice-failure accompanied by throat ailments. From the examination of a  large number of cases, I find it exceptional for a woman, when dressed,  to breathe diaphragmatically, but when the garments are unfastened, and  a few simple directions followed, Nature's mode of breathing commences  to re-assert itself, feebly at first, but vigorously after a little  practice. Very many men also breathe clavicularly, to the great  detriment of their voices, whether in speaking or in singing. I have  noticed, however that whereas the majority of women _always_ breathe  clavicularly, comparatively few men adopt this pernicious habit unless  when using the voice, which is, of course, the worst time for them to  employ it. As a rule, men re-acquire the natural manner of breathing  more easily and quickly than women; this may be partly accounted for by  their greater freedom from constricting garments. After a few weeks'  training of the respiratory muscles, the lung capacity frequently  exceeds, in women especially, the average given in Hutchinson's tables.    \"Thanking you in anticipation for your courtesy in publishing this  letter,--I am, sir, yours &c.,    \"K.
