He once competed with his brother Annibal for  an altar-piece intended for the church of the Carthusians. His design was  preferred; and it was then that in his Communion of S. Girolamo he produced  one of the most celebrated pictures of which Bologna can boast. Nothing can  be imagined finer than the expression of devotion in the aged saint, the  piety of the priest at the communion, the looks of the spectators, who  support the dying, who catch his last accents, committing them instantly to  writing, lest they escape; countenances finely varied and animated, each  breathing and speaking, as it were, peculiar mind. On its first exhibition,  the pupils thronged around the picture to make their studies, insomuch that  Annibal, urged by jealousy, assumed more of his brother's taste, becoming  more select and slow, contriving further to addict his brother to  engraving; a plan in which he succeeded. He returned, as a painter, to  Rome; and the fine representation of Poetry, so much admired in the Farnese  gallery, was, in great part, owing to his talent; and the same may be said  of the fables of Cephalus and Galatea, exquisitely graceful productions,  which seem dictated by a poet, and executed by a Greek artist. Hence it was  rumoured that in the Farnesian paintings the engraver had surpassed the  painter; at which Annibal, no longer able to subdue his envy, removed his  brother from the undertaking under a variety of false pretences; nor was  any humility on the part of Agostino, any advice of his elders, or any  mediation of the great, sufficient to appease him. Quitting Rome, Agostino  entered into the service of the Duke of Parma, for whom he painted  Celestial Love, Terrestrial Love, and Venal Love, to adorn one of the  halls, a very beautiful work, which he terminated only just before his  death. A single figure remained wanting, and this the duke would never  consent to have supplied by any other hand. At the point of death he was  seized with lively remorse, on account of his many licentious engravings  and prints, and even wept bitterly. At that period he designed a picture of  the Last Judgment, which, however, he was unable to complete. In the  account of his funeral, and in the oration recited on that occasion by  Lucio Faberio, mention is made of a head of Jesus Christ, in the character  of the universal judge, painted at that time, though unfinished, upon a  black ground. Such a head is pointed out in the Albani palace at Rome, and  duplicates exist elsewhere. In the features we see exhibited all that is at  once most majestic and most terrible within the limits of the human  imagination.    Annibal was greatly celebrated in Lombardy in every peculiar taste which he  chose to pursue. In his earliest works Mengs declares that he traces the  appearance, but not the depth and reality of Coreggio's style; but it is an  appearance so extremely plausible, that it compels us to pronounce him one  of the most perfect imitators of that consummate master. His Taking down  from the Cross, at the church of the Capuccini in Parma, may challenge the  most distinguished followers of the Parmese School. His picture of S. Rocco  is still more celebrated, comprising the perfections of different artists,  a piece engraved in aqua forte by Guido Reni. It was executed for Reggio,  thence transferred to Modena, and from the last place to Dresden. He  represented the saint, standing near a portico on a basement, and  dispensing his wealth to poor mendicants; a composition not so very rich in  figures as in knowledge of the art. A throng of paupers, as different in  point of infirmity as in age and sex, is admirably varied, both in the  grouping and the gestures. One is seen receiving with gratitude, another  impatiently expecting, a third counting his alms with delight; every object  is misery and humiliation, and yet every thing seems to display the  abundance and dignity of the artist. But proceeding to Rome in the year  1600, he entered on another career; \"he checked his fire,\" observes Mengs,  \"he improved the extravagance of his forms, imitated Raffaello and the  ancients, retaining at the same time a portion of the style of Coreggio to  support dignity.\" (Tom. ii. p. 19.) Albano makes use of nearly the same  words in a letter given by Bellori, (p. 44,) adding, that Annibal, in the  opinion of competent judges, \"far surpassed his cousin, from a knowledge of  the works of Raffaello, in addition to that of the most beautiful ancient  statues.\" He was there employed in various churches, though his crowning  effort, and nearly the whole foundation of the art, as restored by his  means, are to be sought for in the Farnese palace. The subjects were  selected by Monsig. Agucchi; and together with the allegories may be read  in Bellori. In a small chamber he gave representations of the Virtues, such  as his _Choice of Hercules_, _Hercules sustaining the World_, _Ulysses the  Liberator_; in the gallery various fables of Virtuous Love, such as those  of Arion and Prometheus; with others of Venal Love, among which a wonderful  figure of a Bacchanal is one of the most conspicuous. The work is admirably  distributed and varied with ovals, cornices, and with a variety of  ornamental figures, sometimes in stucco, at others in chiaroscuro, where  the effect of his assiduous studies of the Farnesian Hercules is very  apparent, as well as of the _torso_ of the Belvidere, which he accurately  designed, without even having the model before him. The whole of the other  parts breathe Attic elegance combined with Raffaellesque grace, and  imitations not only of his own Tibaldi but of Bonarruoti himself, no less  than all the sprightly and the powerful added to the art by the Venetians  and Lombards. This was the earliest production, where, as in Pandora's box,  all the geniuses of the Italian schools united their several gifts; and in  its fit place I described the astonishment created by it at Rome, with the  revolution it occasioned in the whole art.    On account of this work he is ranked by Mengs next after the three leading  masters in the fourth degree, and even esteemed supereminent in regard to  the form of his virile figures. Poussin asserts, that after Raffaello there  were no better compositions than these, and he prefers the decorative heads  and figures already mentioned, with the other naked forms, in which the  artist was said to have surpassed himself, even to his fables so  beautifully painted. To him Baglione refers the method of colouring from  nature, which was nearly lost, as well as the true art of  landscape-painting, afterwards imitated by the Flemish. To these might  likewise be added the use of caricatures, which no one better than he knew  how to copy from nature, and to increase with ideal power. In the Roman  galleries many of Annibal's pictures are to be met with, conducted in this  new style; and there is one in the Lancellotti palace, small, and painted  _a colla_,[26] rivalling, I had almost said, the best pieces of Ercolani.  It is a Pan teaching Apollo to play upon the pipe; figures at once  designed, coloured, and disposed with the hand of a great master. They are  so finely expressive, that we see in the countenance of the youth,  humility, and apprehension of committing an error; and in that of the old  man, turning another way, peculiar attention to the sound, his pleasure in  possessing such a pupil, and his anxiety to conceal from him his real  opinion, lest he might happen to grow vain.[27]         Footnote 26: In colours, of which yolk of egg, or a kind of       glue, is the vehicle.         Footnote 27: See the _Dissertazione su la Pittura_, by the       Canon Lazzarini, in the Catalogue of Pictures at Pesaro, p.       118.    No other pieces so exquisitely finished are found by his hand at Bologna,  where there prevails the same strong party, commenced in the time of the  Caracci, and which prefers Lodovico to Annibal. When we reflect that  Annibal, in addition to the patrimony left by his school, conferred upon it  the riches which the genius of the Greeks, throughout many ages and many  places had collected to adorn their style; when we reflect on the progress,  which, on observing his new style at Rome, was made by Domenichino, Guido,  Albano, Lanfranco, with the new light which it afforded to Algardi,  according to the supposition of Passeri, in respect to sculpture, and the  improvement which by his means took place in the very pleasing and  attractive painting of Flanders and of Holland, we feel inclined to  coincide with the general sentiment entertained beyond the limits of  Bologna, that Annibal was the most eminent artist of his family. At the  same time we may allow, that Agostino was the greater genius, and Lodovico,  to whom we are indebted for both, the greater teacher of these three. As  such, too, the learned Ab. Magnani, librarian and lecturer upon eloquence  to the institution, assigns to him the office of teacher, in an able  oration upon the fine arts, printed at Parma by Bodoni, along with others  by the same author.    The three Caracci may be almost said to define the boundaries of the golden  age of painting in Italy. They are her last sovereign masters, unless we  are willing to admit a few of their select pupils, who extended that period  during the space of some years. Excellent masters, doubtless, flourished  subsequently; but after their decease, the powers of such artists appearing  less elevated and less solid, we begin to hear complaints respecting the  decline of the art. Nor were there wanting those who contended for a  secondary age of silver, dating from Guido down to the time of Giordano, as  well on account of the minor merit of the artists, as for the prices, so  much greater than formerly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#19)"],[1,"me I will see no blood shed at her bridal,     you saw her whisper me erewhile.

I understood that you     had apprehended it, and walked here to brave him: and that you     had held your life contemptible, in regard of your honour.       DAW: No, no; no such thing, I assure you. He and I parted now,     as good friends as could be.       TRUE: Trust not you to that visor. I saw him since dinner with     another face: I have known many men in my time vex'd with losses,     with deaths, and with abuses; but so offended a wight as sir     Amorous, did I never see, or read of. For taking away his guests,     sir, to-day, that's the cause: and he declares it behind your back     with such threatenings and contempts--He said to Dauphine, you     were the arrant'st ass--       DAW: Ay, he may say his pleasure.       TRUE: And swears you are so protested a coward, that he knows you     will never do him any manly or single right, and therefore he will     take his course.       DAW: I'll give him any satisfaction, sir--but fighting.       TRUE: Ay, sir: but who knows what satisfaction he'll take? blood     he thirsts for, and blood he will have: and whereabouts on you he     will have it, who knows but himself?

In good faith, sir Amorous, he is not this way; I pray you be     merciful, do not murder him; he is a Christian, as good as you:     you are arm'd as if you sought revenge on all his race.

I will     strangle him in this towel--which leads us to conjecture that the     main cause of his fury is, for bringing your meat to-day, with a     towel about you, to his discredit.
