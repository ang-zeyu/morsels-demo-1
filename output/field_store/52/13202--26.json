The Nature of Sin.=--The English word \"sin\" represents a very       great variety of terms occurring in the original languages, the       literal translation of which bear to one another a very great       similarity. Thus, in the Old Testament, the following terms among       others occur:--_setim_ (referred to in Psalms ci, 3), signifying       \"to deviate from the way;\" _shegagah_ (Lev. iv, 2; Num. xv, 27),       \"to err in the way;\" _avon_, \"the crooked, or perverted;\" _avel_,       \"to turn aside.\" In the New Testament we find, _hemartia_, \"the       missing of a mark;\" _parabasis_, \"the transgressing of a line;\"       _parakoe_, \"disobedience to a voice;\" _paraptoma_, \"falling from       uprightness; \"_agnoema_, \"unjustifiable ignorance;\" _hettema_,       \"giving only partial measure;\" _anomia_, \"non-observance of law;\"       _plemmeleia_, \"a discord.\" The above illustrations are taken       mainly from Mueller and French. In all these expressions, the       predominant idea is that of departure from the way of God, of       separation from His companionship by opposition to the Divine       requirements. Sin was introduced into the world from without; it       was not a natural product of earth. The seed of disobedience was       planted in the mind of Eve by the arch-fiend: that seed took       root; and much fruit, of the nature that we, with unguarded       words, call calamity, is the result. From these thorns and       thistles of mortality, a Savior has been prepared to deliver us.         =3. Eden.=--In the Hebrew tongue, from which our word \"Eden\" is       taken, this term signifies something particularly delightful,--a       place of pleasantness; the place is also called \"the garden of       the Lord.\" One particular spot in the land of Eden was prepared       by the Lord as a garden; this was situated eastward in Eden. From       the garden, the parents of the race were expelled after the Fall,       though it is reasonable to suppose that they still dwelt in the       land or region of Eden. We read that at a later date, Cain, the       first murderer, \"went out from the presence of the Lord, and       dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden\" (Gen. iv, 16).       Though there is no uniform belief among Christian scholars as to       the geographical location of Eden, the majority claim that it was       in Persia; however, the most radical among the advocates of this       view fail to prove any marked resemblance between the region at       present and the place described in the Bible. The Latter-day       Saints have more exact knowledge on the matter, a revelation       having been given through Joseph Smith, at Spring Hill, Mo., May       19, 1838, in which that place is named by the Lord       \"Adam-ondi-Ahman, because, said he, it is the place where Adam       shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit,       as spoken of by Daniel the prophet\" (Doc. and Cov. cxvi). From       another revelation we learn (Doc. and Cov. cvii, 52-53) that       three years before his death, Adam called together in the valley       of Adam-ondi-Ahman those of his sons who had been made High       Priests, together with the rest of his righteous posterity, and       there bestowed upon them his patriarchal blessings, the event       being marked by special manifestations from the Lord (see also       Doc. and Cov. cxvii, 8). The Lord has pointed out in this day the       exact location of the altar upon which Adam offered sacrifices       after his expulsion from the Garden (see Contributor, Vol. vii,       page 314). There is no authentic record of the human race having       inhabited the Eastern Hemisphere until after the flood. The       Western Continent, called now the New World, comprises indeed the       oldest inhabited regions of earth. The west, not the east, is the       \"cradle of nations.\"         =4. The Serpent=, as stated, having aided the purposes of Satan,       received from the Lord a special curse (see Genesis iii, 13, 15,       and the Pearl of Great Price, p. 16). The creature was doomed to       a life of degradation. Even from the standpoint of anatomy, the       serpent is a degraded type. Though a vertebrate,--a member of the       highest sub-kingdom of animals, it is devoid even of external       limbs, and its means of locomotion are of no higher order than       are those of the worm and the caterpillar. In the scriptures, the       serpent is made the symbol of craft, subtlety, cunning, and       danger.         =5. Mortality Essential.=--President John Taylor, after       discussing the succession of events leading up to the Fall,       says--\"Thus it would appear that if any of the links of this       great chain had been broken, it would have interfered with the       comprehensive plan of the Almighty pertaining to the salvation       and eternal exaltation of those spirits who were His sons, and       for whom principally the world was made: that they, through       submission to the requirements of the eternal principle and law       governing those matters, might possess bodies, and those bodies       united with the spirits might become living souls, and being the       sons of God, and made in the image of God, they through the       atonement might be exalted, by obedience to the law of the       Gospel, to the Godhead.\"--_Mediation and Atonement_, p. 135.         =6. Beneficent Results of the Fall.=--\"'Honor thy father and thy       mother.' This was one of the ten special commandments given to       Israel, during a grand display of God's power and glory on Mount       Sinai. In the past centuries of darkness it appears to have lost       its significance with the Christian world. They do not appear to       realize that honor is due to the first parents of the human race.       They have been long taught that Adam and Eve were great       transgressors, and have mourned over the fact that they partook       of the forbidden fruit and brought death into the world. There is       no possibility that the fall of man was an accident or chance,       any more than was his creation. If an accident, then why was       Christ prepared from before the foundation of the world as a       propitiation for sin, and to open up the way for man to       immortality? Christ's mediation was a sequence of the fall\" (see       Acts v, 31). \"Without the fall there would have been no broken       law, and therefore nothing to repent of; and there could be no       forgiveness of sin without the atonement of Christ. The Book of       Mormon makes this subject very plain: 'And now, behold, if Adam       had not transgressed, he would not have fallen; but he would have       remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were       created, must have remained in the same state which they were       after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and       had no end. And they would have had no children; wherefore they       would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for       they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin' (II       Nephi ii, 22-23).... We, the children of Adam, have no right to       bring accusations against the Patriarch of the race. But rather,       we should rejoice with them, that through their fall and the       atonement of Jesus Christ, the way of eternal life has been       opened up to us.\"--_A Compendium of the Doctrines of the Gospel_:       F. D. Richards and J. A. Little, pp. 3-4.         =7. The Fall Fore-known.=--\"'Mormonism' accepts the doctrine of       the Fall, and the account of the transgression in Eden, as set       forth in Genesis; but it affirms that none save Adam shall ever       have to account for Adam's disobedience; that mankind in general       are absolutely absolved from the responsibility for that       'original sin,' and that each shall answer for his own       transgressions alone. That the Fall was foreknown of God,--that       it was the accepted means by which the necessary condition of       mortality should be inaugurated; and that a Redeemer was provided       before the world was. That general salvation, in the sense of       redemption from the effects of the Fall, comes to all without       their seeking it; but that individual salvation or rescue from       the effects of personal sins is to be acquired by each for       himself, by faith and good works through the redemption wrought       by Jesus Christ.\"--_The Philosophy of Mormonism_: The Author;       Improvement Era, Vol. IV, pp. 465-466.         =8. The Fall a Process of Physical Degeneracy.=--For a concise       treatment of this topic see \"Jesus the Christ,\" pp. 19 and 29.          LECTURE IV.    THE ATONEMENT, AND SALVATION.         =Article 3.=--We believe that through the atonement of Christ,       all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances       of the gospel.      THE ATONEMENT.    =1. The Atonement of Christ= is taught as a leading doctrine by all  sects professing Christianity. The expression is so common a one, and  the essential point of its signification is so generally admitted,  that definitions may appear to be superfluous; nevertheless, there is  a peculiar importance attached to the use of the word atonement, in a  theological sense. The doctrine of the atonement comprises proof of  the divinity of Christ's earthly ministry; and the vicarious nature of  His death, as a fore-ordained and voluntary sacrifice, intended for  and efficacious as a propitiation for the sins of mankind, thus  becoming the means whereby salvation may be obtained.    =2.= The New Testament, which is properly regarded as the scripture of  Christ's mission among men,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#19)"],[1," her feet, but she still clung to him and stared  apprehensively about her. The chamber was a large one, with marble walls  partly covered with black velvet hangings and thick rich carpets on the  mosaic floor, laved in the soft golden glow of bronze lamps.    Conan instinctively laid a hand on his hilt. There was blood on his  hand, blood clotted about the mouth of his scabbard, for he had sheathed  his blade without cleansing it.    'Where are we?' he demanded.    The stranger answered with a low, profound bow in which the suspicious  king could detect no trace of irony.    'In the temple of Asura, your Majesty.'    Albiona cried out faintly and clung closer to Conan, staring fearfully  at the black, arched doors, as if expecting the entry of some grisly  shape of darkness.    'Fear not, my lady,' said their guide. 'There is nothing here to harm  you, vulgar superstition to the contrary. If your monarch was  sufficiently convinced of the innocence of our religion to protect us  from the persecution of the ignorant, then certainly one of his subjects  need have no apprehensions.'    'Who are you?' demanded Conan.    'I am Hadrathus, priest of Asura. One of my followers recognized you  when you entered the city, and brought the word to me.'    Conan grunted profanely.    'Do not fear that others discovered your identity,' Hadrathus assured  him. 'Your disguise would have deceived any but a follower of Asura,  whose cult it is to seek below the aspect of illusion. You were followed  to the watch tower, and some of my people went into the tunnel to aid  you if you returned by that route. Others, myself among them, surrounded  the tower. And now, King Conan, it is yours to command. Here in the  temple of Asura you are still king.'    'Why should you risk your lives for me?' asked the king.    'You were our friend when you sat upon your throne,' answered Hadrathus.  'You protected us when the priests of Mitra sought to scourge us out of  the land.'    Conan looked about him curiously. He had never before visited the temple  of Asura, had not certainly known that there was such a temple in  Tarantia. The priests of the religion had a habit of hiding their  temples in a remarkable fashion. The worship of Mitra was overwhelmingly  predominant in the Hyborian nations, but the cult of Asura persisted, in  spite of official ban and popular antagonism. Conan had been told dark  tales of hidden temples where intense smoke drifted up incessantly from  black altars where kidnapped humans were sacrificed before a great  coiled serpent, whose fearsome head swayed for ever in the haunted  shadows.    Persecution caused the followers of Asura to hide their temples with  cunning art, and to veil their rituals in obscurity; and this secrecy,  in turn, evoked more monstrous suspicions and tales of evil.    But Conan's was the broad tolerance of the barbarian, and he had refused  to persecute the followers of Asura or to allow the people to do so on  no better evidence than was presented against them, rumors and  accusations that could not be proven. 'If they are black magicians,' he  had said, 'how will they suffer you to harry them? If they are not,  there is no evil in them. Crom's devils! Let men worship what gods they  will.'    At a respectful invitation from Hadrathus he seated himself on an ivory  chair, and motioned Albiona to another, but she preferred to sit on a  golden stool at his feet, pressing close against his thigh, as if  seeking security in the contact. Like most orthodox followers of Mitra,  she had an intuitive horror of the followers and cult of Asura,  instilled in her infancy and childhood by wild tales of human sacrifice  and anthropomorphic gods shambling through shadowy temples.    Hadrathus stood before them, his uncovered head bowed.    'What is your wish, your Majesty?'    'Food first,' he grunted, and the priest smote a golden gong with a  silver wand.    Scarcely had the mellow notes ceased echoing when four hooded figures  came through a curtained doorway bearing a great four-legged silver  platter of smoking dishes and crystal vessels. This they set before  Conan, bowing low, and the king wiped his hands on the damask, and  smacked his lips with unconcealed relish.    'Beware, your Majesty!' whispered Albiona. 'These folk eat human flesh!'    'I'll stake my kingdom that this is nothing but honest roast beef,'  answered Conan. 'Come, lass, fall to! You must be hungry after the  prison fare.'    Thus advised, and with the example before her of one whose word was the  ultimate law to her, the countess complied, and ate ravenously though  daintily, while her liege lord tore into the meat joints and guzzled the  wine with as much gusto as if he had not already eaten once that night.    'You priests are shrewd, Hadrathus,' he said, with a great beef-bone in  his hands and his mouth full of meat. 'I'd welcome your service in my  campaign to regain my kingdom.'    Slowly Hadrathus shook his head, and Conan slammed the beef-bone down on  the table in a gust of impatient wrath.    'Crom's devils! What ails the men of Aquilonia? First Servius--now you!  Can you do nothing but wag your idiotic heads when I speak of ousting  these dogs?'    Hadrathus sighed and answered slowly: 'My lord, it is ill to say, and I  fain would say otherwise. But the freedom of Aquilonia is at an end.  Nay, the freedom of the whole world may be at an end! Age follows age in  the history of the world, and now we enter an age of horror and slavery,  as it was long ago.'    'What do you mean?' demanded the king uneasily.    Hadrathus dropped into a chair and rested his elbows on his thighs,  staring at the floor.    'It is not alone the rebellious lords of Aquilonia and the armies of  Nemedia which are arrayed against you,' answered Hadrathus. 'It is  sorcery--grisly black magic from the grim youth of the world. An awful  shape has risen out of the shades of the Past, and none can stand before  it.'    'What do you mean?' Conan repeated.    'I speak of Xaltotun of Acheron, who died three thousand years ago, yet  walks the earth today.'    Conan was silent, while in his mind floated an image--the image of a  bearded face of calm inhuman beauty. Again he was haunted by a sense of  uneasy familiarity. Acheron--the sound of the word roused instinctive  vibrations of memory and associations in his mind.    'Acheron,' he repeated. 'Xaltotun of Acheron--man, are you mad? Acheron  has been a myth for more centuries than I can remember. I've often  wondered if it ever existed at all.'    'It was a black reality,' answered Hadrathus, 'an empire of black  magicians, steeped in evil now long forgotten. It was finally overthrown  by the Hyborian tribes of the west. The wizards of Acheron practised  foul necromancy, thaumaturgy of the most evil kind, grisly magic taught  them by devils. And of all the sorcerers of that accursed kingdom, none  was so great as Xaltotun of Python.'    'Then how was he ever overthrown?' asked Conan skeptically.    'By some means a source of cosmic power which he jealously guarded was  stolen and turned against him. That source has been returned to him, and  he is invincible.'    Albiona, hugging the headsman's black cloak about her, stared from the  priest to the king, not understanding the conversation. Conan shook his  head angrily.    'You are making game of me,' he growled. 'If Xaltotun has been dead  three thousand years, how can this man be he? It's some rogue who's  taken the old one's name.'    Hadrathus leaned to an ivory table and opened a small gold chest which  stood there. From it he took something which glinted dully in the mellow  light--a broad gold coin of antique minting.    'You have seen Xaltotun unveiled? Then look upon this. It is a coin  which was stamped in ancient Acheron, before its fall. So pervaded with  sorcery was that black empire, that even this coin has its uses in  making magic.'    Conan took it and scowled down at it. There was no mistaking its great  antiquity. Conan had handled many coins in the years of his plunderings,  and had a good practical knowledge of them. The edges were worn and the  inscription almost obliterated. But the countenance stamped on one side  was still clear-cut and distinct. And Conan's breath sucked in between  his clenched teeth. It was not cool in the chamber, but he felt a  prickling of his scalp, an icy contraction of his flesh. The countenance  was that of a bearded man, inscrutable, with a calm inhuman beauty.    'By Crom! It's he!' muttered Conan. He understood, now, the sense of  familiarity that the sight of the bearded man had roused in him from the  first. He had seen a coin like this once before, long ago in a far land.    With a shake of his shoulders he growled: 'The likeness is only a  coincidence--or if he's shrewd enough to assume a forgotten wizard's  name, he's shrewd enough to assume his likeness.' But he spoke without  conviction. The sight of that coin had shaken the foundations of his  universe. He felt that reality and stability were crumbing into an abyss  of illusion and sorcery. A wizard was understandable; but this was  diabolism beyond sanity.    'We cannot doubt that it is indeed Xaltotun of Python,' said Hadrathus.  'He it was who shook down the cliffs at Valkia, by his spells that  enthrall the elementals of the earth--he it was who sent the creature of  darkness into your tent before dawn.'    Conan scowled at him. 'How did you know that?'    'The followers of Asura have secret channels of knowledge. That does not  matter. But do you realize the futility of sacrificing your subjects in  a vain attempt to regain your crown?'    Conan rested his chin on his fist, and stared grimly into nothing.  Albiona watched him anxiously, her mind groping bewildered in the mazes  of the problem that confronted him.    'Is there no wizard in the world who could make magic to fight  Xaltotun's magic?' he asked at last.    Hadrathus shook"]]]
