The sum which he will receive for his six great frescoes and the  ornamental frieze, will be 80,000 thalers (12,000_l._ sterling) and this  is secured to him, as the contract was made before the existence of a  constitutional budget.           *       *       *       *       *    Homer's Odyssey furnishes the subjects for a series of frescoes now  being executed in one of the royal palaces at Munich. Six halls are  devoted to the work; four of them are already finished, sixteen cantos  of the poem being illustrated on their walls. The designs are by  Schwanthaler, and executed by Hiltensperger. Between the different  frescoes are small landscapes representing natural scenes from the same  poem.           *       *       *       *       *    If we credit all the accounts of pictures by the old masters, we must  believe that they produced as many works as with ordinary energy they  could have printed had they lived till 1850. The _Journal de Lot et  Garonne_ states that in the church of the Mas-d'Agenais, Count Eugene de  Lonley has discovered, in the sacristy, concealed beneath dust and  spiders' webs, the 'Dying Christ,' painted by Rubens in 1631.

Music and the Drama.      THE ASTOR PLACE OPERA    We have watched with interest the attempts which have been made for  several years to establish permanently the Italian opera in New York.  Although we disapprove of some of the means which have been used to  accomplish this object, yet, upon the whole, those who have been  efficient in the matter, both amateurs and artists, are entitled to the  hearty commendation of our musical world. To the enterprising Maretzek  belongs the palm, for his energy, liberality, and discrimination, in  bringing forward, in succession, so many great works, and so many  artists of superior excellence. No man could have accomplished what has  been accomplished by Maretzek, without a combination of very rare  endowments. Let the public then see to it that one who has done so much  for the cultivation and gratification of a taste for the most refining  and delightful of the arts, does not remain unappreciated and  unrewarded. Of the last star which has been brought forward by M.  Maretzek, the musical critic of _The International_ (who has been many  years familiar with the performances of the most celebrated artists in  London, Paris, St. Petersburgh and Vienna, and who, it is pertinent to  mention, never saw M. Maretzek or Mlle. Parodi except in the orchestra  or upon the stage) gives these opinions.    As an artist, Parodi ranks among the very best of Europe.  Notwithstanding so few years have elapsed since her first appearance  upon the stage, she has attained a reputation second only to that of  Grisi and Persiani. We have often had the pleasure of listening to both  of these last-named celebrities, in their principal roles, and have  dwelt with rapture upon their soul-stirring representations. We have  also listened to the Norma and the Lucrezia Borgia of Parodi, and have  been equally delighted and astonished. Her excellences may be briefly  summed up as follows: With an organ of very great compass and of perfect  register, she combines immense power and endurance, and a variety and  perfection of intonation unsurpassed by any living artist. When she  portrays the softer emotions--affection, love, or benevolence--nothing  can be more sweet, pure, and melodious, than her tones; when rage,  despair, hate, or jealousy, seize upon her, still is she true to nature,  and her notes thrill us to the very soul, by their perfect truthfulness,  power, and intensity of expression. If gayety is the theme, no bird  carols more blithely than the Italian warbler. What singer can sustain a  high or a low tone, or execute a prolonged and varied shake, with more  power and accuracy than Parodi? What prima donna can run through the  chromatic scale, or dally with difficult cadenzas, full of unique  intervals, with more ease and precision than our charming Italian? Who  can execute a musical tour de force with more effect than she has so  recently done in Norma and Lucrezia?    Persiani has acquired her great reputation by husbanding her powers for  the purpose of making frequent points, and on this account she is not  uniform, but by turn electrifies and tires her audience. She passes  through the minor passages, undistinguished from those around her, but  in the concerted pieces, and wherever she can introduce a cadenza or a  _tour de force_, she carries all before her. Parodi is good  _everywhere_--in the dull recitative, and in the secondary and  unimportant passages. Her magnificent acting, combined with her superb  vocalization, enchain through the entire opera.    Grisi, like Parodi, is always uniform and accurate in her  representations, and upon the whole should be regarded as the queen of  song; but with these exceptions we know of no person who deserves a  higher rank as a true artist than Parodi. As yet she is not sufficiently  understood. She electrifies her hearers, and secures their entire  sympathies, but they have still to learn that silvery and melodious  tones, and cool mechanical execution, do not alone constitute a genuine  artist or a faultless prima donna. When the public understand how  perfectly Parodi identifies herself with the emotions and passions she  has to portray,--when they appreciate the immense variety of intonations  with which she illustrates her characters, and the earnestness and  intensity with which she throws her whole nature into all she does--then  she will be hailed as the greatest artist ever on this continent, and  one of the greatest in the world.           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. E. Oakes Smith's new tragedy called \"The Roman Tribute,\" has been  produced in Philadelphia for several nights in succession, with very  decided success. The leading character in this play, a noble old Roman,  is quite an original creation. He is represented as a mixture of antique  patriotism, heroic valor, sublime fidelity, and stern resolution, tinged  with a beautiful coloring of romance which softens and relieves his more  commanding virtues. Several feminine characters of singular loveliness  are introduced. The play abounds in scenes of deep passion and thrilling  pathos, while its chaste elegance of language equally adapts it for the  closet or the stage. It was brought out with great splendor of costume,  scenery, proscenium, and the other usual accessories of stage effect,  and presented one of the most gorgeous spectacles of the season. We are  gratified to learn that the dramatic talent of this richly-gifted lady,  concerning which we have before expressed ourselves in terms of high  encomium, has received such a brilliant illustration from the test of  stage experiment. Mrs. Oakes Smith's admirable play of \"Jacob Leisler\"  will probably be acted in New York during the season.           *       *       *       *       *    LEIGH HUNT UPON G.P.R. JAMES.

As Pohl takes pains to point out, he spoke highly of  Haydn whenever opportunity offered, often chose one of his themes when  improvising in public, scored one of his quartets for his own use, and  lovingly preserved the autograph of one of the English symphonies. That  he came in the end to realize his true greatness is amply proved by  the story already related which represents him as exclaiming on his  death-bed upon the fact of Haydn having been born in a common peasant's  cottage.    In the meantime, although Beethoven was dissatisfied with his progress  under Haydn, there was no open breach between the two. It is true that  the young musician sought another teacher--one Schenck, a well-known  Viennese composer--but this was done without Haydn's knowledge, out of  consideration, we may assume, for his feelings. That master and pupil  were still on the best of terms may be gathered from their having been  at Eisenstadt together during the summer of 1793. In the January of  the following year Haydn set out on his second visit to England, and  Beethoven transferred himself to Albrechtsberger.    The Haydn Museum    Haydn's life in Vienna during the eighteen months which intervened  between the two London visits was almost totally devoid of incident. His  wife, it will be remembered, had written to him in England, asking for  money to buy a certain house which she fancied for a \"widow's home.\"  Haydn was astute enough not to send the money, but on his return to  Vienna, finding the house in every way to his liking, he bought  it himself. Frau Haydn died seven years later, \"and now,\" said the  composer, speaking in 1806, \"I am living in it as a widower.\" The house  is situated in the suburb of Vienna known as Gumpendorf. It is No. 19  of the Haydngasse and bears a marble memorial tablet, affixed to it in  1840. The pious care of the composer's admirers has preserved it almost  exactly as it was in Haydn's day, and has turned it into a kind of  museum containing portraits and mementoes of the master, the original  manuscript of \"The Creation,\" and other interesting relics.    Starts for London    Haydn started on his journey to England on January 19, 1794, Salomon  having brought him, under a promise to return with six new symphonies  which he was to conduct in person. This time he travelled down the  Rhine, and he had not been many days on the way when news reached him of  the death of Prince Anton Esterhazy, who had very reluctantly given him  leave of absence. On the occasion of the first London visit Salomon had  been his travelling companion; now, feeling doubtless the encumbrance  of increasing years, Haydn took his servant and copyist, Johann Elssler,  along with him.    Honest Elssler    It may be noted in passing that he entertained a very warm regard for  Elssler, whose father had been music copyist to Prince Esterhazy. He was  born at Eisenstadt in 1769, and, according to Pohl, lived the whole of  his life with Haydn, first as copyist, and then as general servant and  factotum. It was Elssler who tended the composer in his last years, a  service recompensed by the handsome bequest of 6000 florins, which he  lived to enjoy until 1843. No man, it has been said, is a hero to his  valet, but \"Haydn was to Elssler a constant subject of veneration, which  he carried so far that when he thought himself unobserved he would stop  with the censer before his master's portrait as if it were the altar.\"  This \"true and honest servant\" copied a large amount of Haydn's  music, partly in score, partly in separate parts, much of which is now  treasured as the autograph of Haydn, though the handwritings of the two  are essentially different. It is a pity that none of the earlier writers  on Haydn thought of applying to Elssler for particulars of the private  life of the composer. He could have given information on many obscure  points, and could have amplified the details of this second London  visit, about which we know much less than we know about the former  visit.    The Salomon Concerts    Salomon's first concert had been arranged for the 3rd of February, but  Haydn did not arrive until the 4th, and the series accordingly began  upon the 10th. Twelve concerts were given in all, and with the most  brilliant success. The six new symphonies commissioned by Salomon were  performed, and the previous set were also repeated, along with some new  quartets. Of the many contemporary notices of the period, perhaps the  most interesting is that which appears in the Journal of Luxury and  Fashion, published at Weimar in July 1794. It is in the form of a London  letter, written on March 25, under the heading of \"On the Present State  and Fashion of Music in England.\" After speaking of Salomon's efforts  on behalf of classical music and of the praise due to him for his  performance of the quartets of \"our old favourite, Haydn,\" the writer  continues: \"But what would you now say to his new symphonies composed  expressly for these concerts, and directed by himself at the piano? It  is truly wonderful what sublime and august thoughts this master weaves  into his works. Passages often occur which render it impossible to  listen to them without becoming excited. We are altogether carried  away by admiration, and forced to applaud with hand and mouth. This is  especially the case with Frenchmen, of whom we have so many here that  all public places are filled with them. You know that they have great  sensibility, and cannot restrain their transports, so that in the midst  of the finest passages in soft adagios they clap their hands in loud  applause and thus mar the effect. In every symphony of Haydn the adagio  or andante is sure to be repeated each time, after the most vehement  encores. The worthy Haydn, whose personal acquaintance I highly value,  conducts himself on these occasions in the most modest manner. He is  indeed a good-hearted, candid, honest man, esteemed and beloved by all.\"    Several notable incidents occurred at the Salomon Concerts. It has been  remarked, as \"an event of some interest in musical history,\" that Haydn  and Wilhelm Cramer appeared together at one concert, Cramer as leader of  the orchestra, Haydn conducting from the pianoforte. But Cramer was  not a genius of the first rank--his compositions are of the slightest  importance--and there was nothing singular about his appearing along  with Haydn. He had been leader at the Handel Festivals at Westminster  Abbey in 1784 and 1787, and was just the man to be engaged for an  enterprise like that of Salomon's.    A \"Smart\" Drummer    An anecdote told of Haydn in connection with one of the rehearsals is  better worth noting. The drummer was found to be absent. \"Can anyone  here play the drum?\" inquired Haydn, looking round from his seat at the  piano. \"I can,\" promptly replied young George (afterwards Sir George)  Smart, who was sitting among the violinists. Smart, who lived to become  the doyen of the musical profession in England, had never handled a  drumstick before, and naturally failed to satisfy the conductor. Haydn  took the drumstick from him and \"showed to the astonished orchestra a  new and unexpected attitude in their leader.\" Then, turning to Smart,  he remarked: \"That is how we use the drumsticks in Germany.\" \"Oh, very  well,\" replied the unabashed youth, \"if you like it better in that way  we can also do it so in London.\"    New Acquaintances    Haydn made several new acquaintances during this visit, the most notable  being, perhaps, Dragonetti, the famous double-bass player, who had  accompanied Banti, the eminent prima donna, to London in 1794. Banti had  been discovered as a chanteuse in a Paris cafe, and afterwards attracted  much notice by her fine voice both in Paris and London. \"She is the  first singer in Italy, and drinks a bottle of wine every day,\" said one  who knew her. In her journeys through Germany, Austria and Italy she won  many triumphs. Haydn composed for her an air, \"Non Partir,\" in E, which  she sang at his benefit. As for \"Old Drag,\" the familiar designation of  the distinguished bassist, his eccentricities must have provided Haydn  with no little amusement. He always took his dog Carlo with him into the  orchestra, and Henry Phillips tells us that, having a strange weakness  for dolls, he often carried one of them to the festivals as his wife!  On his way to Italy in 1798 Dragonetti visited Haydn in Vienna, and was  much delighted with the score of \"The Creation,\" just completed. Several  eminent violinists were in London at the time of Haydn's visit. The most  distinguished of them was perhaps Felice de Giardini, who, at the age of  fourscore, produced an oratorio at Ranelagh Gardens, and even played  a concerto. He had a perfectly volcanic temper, and hated Haydn as the  devil is said to hate holy water. \"I don't wish to see the German dog,\"  he remarked in the composer's hearing, when urged to pay him a visit.  Haydn, as a rule, was kindly disposed to all brother artists, but to be  called a dog was too much, He went to hear Giardini, and then got even  with him by noting in his diary that he \"played like a pig.\"    The accounts preserved of Haydn's second visit to England are,  as already remarked, far less full than those of the first visit.  Unconnected memoranda appear in his diary, some of which are given by  Griesinger and Dies; but they are of comparatively little interest.  During the summer of 1794 he moved about the country a good deal. Thus,  about the 26th of August, he paid a visit to Waverley Abbey, whose  \"Annales Waverliensis\" suggested to Scott the name of his first romance.  The ruined condition of the venerable pile--it dates from 1128--set  Haydn moralizing on the \"Protestant heresy\" which led the \"rascal mob\"  to tear down \"what had once been a stronghold of his own religion.\"    Haydn at Bath    In the following month he spent three days in Bath with Dr Burney,  and"]]]
