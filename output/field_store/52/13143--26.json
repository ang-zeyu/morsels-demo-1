The low, green hill-slopes  were divided into fields, with low drystone walls and ditches. Here and  there a stone barn rose alone, or with a few bare, windy trees attached.  Two rough-coated winter horses pastured on the rough grass, a boy came  along the naked, wide, grass-bordered high-road with a couple of milk  cans, drifting in from nowhere: and it was all so like Cornwall, or a  part of Ireland, that the old nostalgia for the Celtic regions began to  spring up in me. Ah, those old, drystone walls dividing the fields--pale  and granite-blenched! Ah, the dark, sombre grass, the naked sky! the  forlorn horses in the wintry morning! Strange is a Celtic landscape, far  more moving, disturbing than the lovely glamor of Italy and Greece.  Before the curtains of history lifted, one feels the world was like  this--this Celtic bareness and sombreness and _air_. But perhaps it is  not Celtic at all: Iberian. Nothing is more unsatisfactory than our  conception of what is Celtic and what is not Celtic. I believe there  never were any Celts, as a race.--As for the Iberians--!    [Illustration: TONARA]    Wonderful to go out on a frozen road, to see the grass in shadow bluish  with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams  melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and  things standing up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with  roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in  the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad,  on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk  down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk  on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is  built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all  so familiar to my _feet_, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if  I had made a discovery. And I realize that I hate lime-stone, to live on  lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are  dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is  much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under  the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and  I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and  withers.           *       *       *       *       *    After coming to a deep well in a grassy plot in a wide space of the  road, I go back, across the sunny naked upland country, towards the pink  station and its out-buildings. An engine is steaming its white clouds in  the new light. Away to the left there is even a row of small houses,  like a row of railway-mens' dwellings. Strange and familiar sight. And  the station precincts are disorderly and rather dilapidated. I think of  our Sicilian host.    The brown woman gives us coffee, and very strong, rich goats' milk, and  bread. After which the q-b and I set off once more along the road to the  village. She too is thrilled. She too breathes deep. She too feels  _space_ around her, and freedom to move the limbs: such as one does not  feel in Italy and Sicily, where all is so classic and fixed.    The village itself is just a long, winding, darkish street, in shadow,  of houses and shops and a smithy. It might almost be Cornwall: not  quite. Something, I don't know what, suggests the stark burning glare of  summer. And then, of course, there is none of the cosiness which  climbing roses and lilac trees and cottage shops and haystacks would  give to an English scene. This is harder, barer, starker, more dreary.  An ancient man in the black-and-white costume comes out of a hovel of a  cottage. The butcher carries a huge side of meat. The women peer at  us--but more furtive and reticent than the howling stares of Italy.    So we go on, down the rough-cobbled street through the whole length of  the village. And emerging on the other side, past the last cottage, we  find ourselves again facing the open country, on the gentle down-slope  of the rolling hill. The landscape continues the same: low, rolling  upland hills, dim under the yellow sun of the January morning: stone  fences, fields, grey-arable land: a man slowly, slowly ploughing with a  pony and a dark-red cow: the road trailing empty across the distance:  and then, the one violently unfamiliar note, the enclosed cemetery lying  outside on the gentle hill-side, closed in all round, very compact,  with high walls: and on the inside face of the enclosure wall the marble  slabs, like shut drawers of the sepulchres, shining white, the wall  being like a chest of drawers, or pigeon holes to hold the dead. Tufts  of dark and plumy cypresses rise among the flat graves of the enclosure.  In the south, cemeteries are walled off and isolated very tight. The  dead, as it were, are kept fast in pound. There is no spreading of  graves over the face of the country. They are penned in a tight fold,  with cypresses to fatten on the bones. This is the one thoroughly  strange note in the landscape. But all-pervading there is a strangeness,  that strange feeling as if the _depths_ were barren, which comes in the  south and the east, sun-stricken. Sun-stricken, and the heart eaten out  by the dryness.    \"I like it! I like it!\" cries the q-b.    \"But could you live here?\" She would like to say yes, but daren't.    We stray back. The q-b wants to buy one of those saddle-bag  arrangements. I say what for? She says to keep things in. Ach! but  peeping in the shops, we see one and go in and examine it. It is quite a  sound one, properly made: but plain, quite plain. On the white  cross-stripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and  magenta: the three favorite Sardinian colors: nor are there any of the  fantastic and griffin-like beasts. So it won't do. How much does it  cost? Forty-five francs.    There is nothing to do in Mandas. So we will take the morning train and  go to the terminus, to Sorgono. Thus, we shall cross the lower slopes of  the great central knot of Sardinia, the mountain knot called  Gennargentu. And Sorgono we feel will be lovely.    Back at the station we make tea on the spirit lamp, fill the thermos,  pack the knapsack and the kitchenino, and come out into the sun of the  platform. The q-b goes to thank the black-cap for the white bread,  whilst I settle the bill and ask for food for the journey. The brown  woman fishes out from a huge black pot in the background sundry hunks of  coarse boiled pork, and gives me two of these, hot, with bread and salt.  This is the luncheon. I pay the bill: which amounts to twenty-four  francs, for everything. (One says francs or liras, irrespective, in  Italy.) At that moment arrives the train from Cagliari, and men rush in,  roaring for the soup--or rather, for the broth. \"Ready, ready!\" she  cries, going to the black pot.          V.    TO SORGONO.      The various trains in the junction squatted side by side and had long,  long talks before at last we were off. It was wonderful to be running in  the bright morning towards the heart of Sardinia, in the little train  that seemed so familiar. We were still going third class, rather to the  disgust of the railway officials at Mandas.    At first the country was rather open: always the long spurs of hills,  steep-sided, but not high. And from our little train we looked across  the country, across hill and dale. In the distance was a little town, on  a low slope. But for its compact, fortified look it might have been a  town on the English downs. A man in the carriage leaned out of the  window holding out a white cloth, as a signal to someone in the far off  town that he was coming. The wind blew the white cloth, the town in the  distance glimmered small and alone in its hollow. And the little train  pelted along.    It was rather comical to see it. We were always climbing. And the line  curved in great loops. So that as one looked out of the window, time and  again one started, seeing a little train running in front of us, in a  diverging direction, making big puffs of steam. But lo, it was our own  little engine pelting off around a loop away ahead. We were quite a long  train, but all trucks in front, only our two passenger coaches hitched  on behind. And for this reason our own engine was always running fussily  into sight, like some dog scampering in front and swerving about us,  while we followed at the tail end of the thin string of trucks.    I was surprised how well the small engine took the continuous steep  slopes, how bravely it emerged on the sky-line. It is a queer railway. I  would like to know who made it. It pelts up hill and down dale and round  sudden bends in the most unconcerned fashion, not as proper big railways  do, grunting inside deep cuttings and stinking their way through  tunnels, but running up the hill like a panting, small dog, and having a  look round, and starting off in another direction, whisking us behind  unconcernedly. This is much more fun than the tunnel-and-cutting system.    They told me that Sardinia mines her own coal: and quite enough for her  own needs: but very soft, not fit for steam-purposes. I saw heaps of it:  small, dull, dirty-looking stuff. Truck-loads of it too. And  truck-loads of grain.    At every station we were left ignominiously planted, while the little  engines--they had gay gold names on their black little bodies--strolled  about along the side-lines, and snuffed at the various trucks. There we  sat, at every station, while some truck was discarded and some other  sorted out like a branded sheep, from the sidings and hitched on to us.  It took a long time, this did.           *       *       *       *       *    All the stations so far had had wire netting over the windows. This  means malaria-mosquitoes. The malaria climbs very high in Sardinia.

They had seen a French vessel  wrecked on the coast towards the south. Those who escaped from her were  four or six leagues off, on the banks of a river or arm of the sea,  which they could not cross.    Menendez instantly sent forty or fifty men in boats to reconnoitre.  Next, he called the chaplain,--for he would fain have him at his elbow  to countenance the deeds he meditated,--and, with him twelve soldiers  and two Indian guides, embarked in another boat. They rowed along the  channel between Anastasia Island and the main shore; then they landed,  struck across the island on foot, traversed plains and marshes, reached  the sea towards night, and searched along shore till ten o'clock to  find their comrades who had gone before. At length, with mutual joy, the  two parties met, and bivouacked together on the sands. Not far distant  they could see lights. These were the camp-fires of the shipwrecked  French.    To relate with precision the fortunes of these unhappy men is  impossible; for henceforward the French narratives are no longer the  narratives of eye-witnesses.    It has been seen how, when on the point of assailing the Spaniards at  St. Augustine, Jean Ribaut was thwarted by a gale, which they hailed  as a divine interposition. The gale rose to a tempest of strange fury.  Within a few days, all the French ships were cast on shore, between  Matanzas Inlet and Cape Canaveral. According to a letter of Menendez,  many of those on hoard were lost; but others affirm that all escaped but  a captain, La Grange, an officer of high merit, who was washed from a  floating mast. One of the ships was wrecked at a point farther northward  than the rest, and it was her company whose campfires were seen by the  Spaniards at their bivouac on the sands of Anastasia Island. They were  endeavoring to reach Fort Caroline, of the fate of which they knew  nothing, while Ribaut with the remainder was farther southward,  struggling through the wilderness towards the same goal. What befell the  latter will appear hereafter. Of the fate of the former party there  is no French record. What we know of it is due to three Spanish  eye-witnesses, Mendoza, Doctor Soils de las Meras, and Menendez himself.  Soils was a priest, and brother-in-law to Menendez. Like Mendoza, he  minutely describes what he saw, and, like him, was a red-hot zealot,  lavishing applause on the darkest deeds of his chief. But the principal  witness, though not the most minute or most trustworthy, is Menendez, in  his long despatches sent from Florida to the King, and now first brought  to light from the archives of Seville,--a cool record of unsurpassed  atrocities, inscribed on the back with the royal indorsement, \"Say to  him that he has done well.\"    When the Adelantado saw the French fires in the distance, he lay close  in his bivouac, and sent two soldiers to reconnoitre. At two o'clock in  the morning they came back, and reported that it was impossible to get  at the enemy, since they were on the farther side of an arm of the sea  (Matanzas Inlet). Menendez, however, gave orders to march, and before  daybreak reached the hither bank, where he hid his men in a bushy  hollow. Thence, as it grew light, they could discern the enemy, many  of whom were searching along the sands and shallows for shell-fish, for  they were famishing. A thought struck Menendez, an inspiration, says  Mendoza, of the Holy Spirit. He put on the clothes of a sailor, entered  a boat which had been brought to the spot, and rowed towards the  shipwrecked men, the better to learn their condition. A Frenchman swam  out to meet him. Menendez demanded what men they were.    \"Followers of Ribaut, Viceroy of the King of France,\" answered the  swimmer.    \"Are you Catholics or Lutherans?\"    \"All Lutherans.\"    A brief dialogue ensued, during which the Adelantado declared his name  and character, and the Frenchman gave an account of the designs of  Ribaut, and of the disaster that had thwarted them. He then swam back  to his companions, but soon returned, and asked safe conduct for his  captain and four other gentlemen, who wished to hold conference with the  Spanish general. Menendez gave his word for their safety, and, returning  to the shore, sent his boat to bring them over. On their landing, he  met them very courteously. His followers were kept at a distance, so  disposed behind hills and among bushes as to give an exaggerated idea  of their force,--a precaution the more needful, as they were only about  sixty in number, while the French, says Solfs, were above two hundred.  Menendez, however, declares that they did not exceed a hundred and  forty. The French officer told him the story of their shipwreck, and  begged him to lend them a boat to aid them in crossing the rivers which  lay between them and a fort of their King, whither they were making  their way.    Then came again the ominous question,    \"Are you Catholics or Lutherans?\"    \"We are Lutherans.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" pursued Menendez, \"your fort is taken, and all in it are  put to the sword.\" And, in proof of his declaration, he caused articles  plundered from Fort Caroline to be shown to the unhappy petitioners. He  then left them, and went to breakfast with his officers, first ordering  food to be placed before them. Having breakfasted, he returned to them.    \"Are you convinced now,\" he asked, \"that what I have told you is true?\"    The French captain assented, and implored him to lend them ships in  which to return home. Menendez answered that he would do so willingly if  they were Catholics, and if he had ships to spare, but he had none.  The supplicants then expressed the hope that at least they and their  followers would be allowed to remain with the Spaniards till ships could  be sent to their relief, since there was peace between the two nations,  whose kings were friends and brothers.    \"All Catholics,\" retorted the Spaniard, \"I will befriend; but as you are  of the New Sect, I hold you as enemies, and wage deadly war against you;  and this I will do with all cruelty [crueldad] in this country, where I  command as Viceroy and Captain-General for my King. I am here to plant  the Holy Gospel, that the Indians may be enlightened and come to the  knowledge of the Holy Catholic faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, as the  Roman Church teaches it. If you will give up your arms and banners, and  place yourselves at my mercy, you may do so, and I will act towards you  as God shall give me grace. Do as you will, for other than this you can  have neither truce nor friendship with me.\"    Such were the Adelantado's words, as reported by a bystanders his  admiring brother-in-law and that they contain an implied assurance  of mercy has been held, not only by Protestants, but by Catholics  and Spaniards. The report of Menendez himself is more brief, and  sufficiently equivocal:--    \"I answered, that they could give up their arms and place themselves  under my mercy,--that I should do with them what our Lord should order;  and from that I did not depart, nor would I, unless God our Lord should  otherwise inspire.\"    One of the Frenchmen recrossed to consult with his companions. In two  hours he returned, and offered fifty thousand ducats to secure their  lives; but Menendez, says his brother-in-law, would give no pledges. On  the other hand, expressions in his own despatches point to the inference  that a virtual pledge was given, at least to certain individuals.    The starving French saw no resource but to yield themselves to his  mercy. The boat was again sent across the river. It returned laden  with banners, arquebuses, swords, targets, and helmets. The Adelantado  ordered twenty soldiers to bring over the prisoners, ten at a time. He  then took the French officers aside behind a ridge of sand, two gunshots  from the bank. Here, with courtesy on his lips and murder at his heart,  he said:    \"Gentlemen, I have but few men, and you are so many that, if you were  free, it would be easy for you to take your satisfaction on us for the  people we killed when we took your fort. Therefore it is necessary that  you should go to my camp, four leagues from this place, with your hands  tied.\"    Accordingly, as each party landed, they were led out of sight behind the  sand-hill, and their hands tied behind their backs with the match-cords  of the arquebuses, though not before each had been supplied with  food. The whole day passed before all were brought together, bound and  helpless, under the eye of the inexorable Adelantado. But now Mendoza  interposed. \"I was a priest,\" he says, \"and had the bowels of a man.\"  He asked that if there were Christians--that is to say, Catholics--among  the prisoners, they should be set apart. Twelve Breton sailors professed  themselves to be such; and these, together with four carpenters and  calkers, \"of whom,\" writes Menendez, \"I was in great need,\" were put on  board the boat and sent to St. Augustine. The rest were ordered to march  thither by land.    The Adelantado walked in advance till he came to a lonely spot, not far  distant, deep among the bush-covered hills. Here he stopped, and with  his cane drew a line in the sand. The sun was set when the captive  Huguenots, with their escort, reached the fatal goal thus marked out.  And now let the curtain drop; for here, in the name of Heaven, the  hounds of hell were turned loose, and the savage soldiery, like wolves  in a sheepfold, rioted in slaughter. Of all that wretched company, not  one was left alive.      \"I had their hands tied behind their backs,\" writes the chief criminal,  \"and themselves put to the knife. It appeared to me that, by thus  chastising them, God our Lord and your Majesty were served; whereby in  future this evil sect will leave us more free to plant the Gospel in  these parts.\""]]]
