It was originally in the  possession of the late Mr. Jennings, and, I am informed by Captain Laskey,  was on first being received, in a much finer state. Mr. Jennings had it  cleaned, and in so doing many of the delicate transverse striae were  partially obliterated, and the sharp ridges on the longitudinal ribs worn  down, as indeed was apparent from a drawing Captain L. had made of the  shell previous to this unmerciful cleaning. It however still remains a very  fine shell, and is now in the cabinet of Mrs. Bolton, of Storr's-hall, to  whom I am obliged for the opportunity of now publishing it.    The figure and specific character will sufficiently point out its  distinctions. The body-whorl is smooth, but strongly granulated at the  base; the spire delicately striated between the ribs; the two last whorls  before the apex are close, thick, and somewhat papillary; the apex itself  small and sharp. The upper part of the inner lip has some faint obsolete  teeth, but the base has three very strong ones.    It connects in the most beautiful manner the two genera of _Mitra_ and  _Voluta_. Its country is unknown.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 55    [Illustration]    SOLEN ambiguus.    _Ambiguous Solen._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa bivalvis, aequivalvis, transversissime elongata, utroque latere      hians.

Modern writers have, however, retained nearly all these in the  genus as left by Linnaeus; and this method for the present is more  desirable than that of creating a multiplicity of genera. Dr. Turton, in  his very useful Conchological Dictionary, enumerates thirteen species as  found on the British coast, including the _Solen Novacula_ of Montagu,  which the Doctor suspects is not truly a species. The original specimens  which Montagu described I have carefully inspected at the British Museum,  and have no doubt in my own mind they are in reality no other than _S.  Siliqua_ with one of the cardinal teeth broken off; a circumstance which,  from their fragility, frequently happens, even in opening the recent shell.    _Solen ambiguus_ was first described by Lamarck, who says it is from North  America. Two or three specimens are in my possession; but it is a rare  species, much thicker, and with larger teeth than any other; the epidermis  is pale-brown, and in some parts obliquely lineated.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 56    [Illustration]    RAMPHASTOS vitellinus.    _Sulphur-and-white-breasted Toucan._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 45.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _R. niger, gula flavo-aurantia; lateribus auribusque albis; fascia      pectorali tegminibusque rubris; rostro nigro fascia basali caerulea,      culmine subcurvato convexo, lateribus incrassatis._        Black; throat yellowish-orange; the sides and ears white; pectoral bar      and tail-covers red; bill black, with a blue basal belt, the top convex      and but slightly curved, the sides thickened.

Independent of colour, this differs from _R. Tucanus_ in having the bill  less curved, the top convex and obscure pink, not flat and blue. The belt  at the base is always vivid blue (grey in the dead bird), not, as in _R.  Tucanus_, of a rich yellow. This I have never met with in Brazil; the other  is common from lat. 8 to 23deg S. A drawing from the live bird by the late  Sydenham Edwards (obligingly lent me by Lord Stanley) confirms others I  have seen as to the colour of the bill, orbits, &c. It varies, however, in  that of the throat, breadth of the red band, and in the tail-covers. A  specimen I possess being somewhat larger, the breast is nearly white, and  the upper tail-covers sulphur. In young birds the white on the sides is  tinged with grey. I am inclined to consider the _Grand Toucan a ventre  rouge_ of Vaillant as a mere variety, having the red pectoral bar very  broad.    In general size it is rather larger than the Brazilian Toucan. Our figure  is on the exact scale of four-tenths to an inch. Its precise locality I am  unacquainted with. We hope to enlarge more on this interesting genus in  another publication.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 57    [Illustration]    UNIO nasutus.    _Rostrated River-Mussel._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa transversa, aequivalvis, non affixa; natibus decorticatis,      suberosis; impressio muscularis postica composita.

The colours of all are more or less  dark-brown, sometimes radiated with green; but the specific characters rest  on the contour of the shell and the proportion of the teeth.    There can be no doubt this shell is the _Unio nasutus_ of Say, who refers  to the figure of Lister. The _Unio nasuta_ however of Lamarck I apprehend  will be found different, as he seems to think; his shell also is purple  inside with short thick teeth; indeed so much uncertainty hangs on the  shells of this genus, that the species can only be fixed by ample  descriptions and very correct figures. The figure is from a shell in the  Linnaean Society's cabinet.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39674"],[0,"Buffalo Land (#19)"],[1,"  sometimes in braids and again loosely, over their shoulders, and their  blankets hanging around them, they did really look much like the  traditional squaw who so kindly assists one in cutting his eye-teeth at  Niagara Falls, with her sharp practice and cheap bead-work. Their faces  were as smooth as a woman's, without the least trace of either mustache  or whiskers; so that, altogether, when we essayed to pick out some  females, we got completely \"mixed up,\" and were at length forced to the  conclusion that the majestic White Wolf was traveling over the plains  with a copper-colored harem.    Cooper having told us that the Indian term of reproach is to be or to  look like a woman, we avoided offense and the \"arrows of outrageous  fortune\" which an Indian is so dexterous in using, and gained the  information desired by addressing a direct inquiry to White Wolf,  through the interpreter, whether he had any squaws along. He replied by  holding up two fingers and pointing out the couple thus designated. We  tried to find, first in their features and then in their clothing, some  distinguishing characteristic but found it impossible; so that when they  changed positions an instant afterward, I was entirely at a loss to  recognize them again.    All had extremely uninviting countenances, any one of which would have  sufficed to hang three ordinary men, and a common villainy made them as  much alike as forty-six nutmegs. White Wolf alone differed in  appearance. He was stoutly built, as well as tall and straight, with  broad features, the bronze of his complexion merging almost into white,  and he smiled pleasantly and readily. The others were no more able to  smile than Satan himself, the expression which their faces assumed when  attempting it being simply diabolical. Dobeen was so startled by one  who tried that contortion on and asked for \"tobac,\" that he retreated in  disorder from the council-chamber.    White Wolf and the more important members of his band took the chairs  proffered them, and sat in a circle, the Professor, Sachem, and two  leading citizens of Hays being sandwiched in at proper intervals. The  object of the gathering was gravely announced to be that the Indians  might smoke the pipe of peace with the towns-people. As war was a  chronic passion with these wild horsemen of the plains, none of them had  ever been near the place in friendly mood before, and the novelty of the  occasion, therefore, brought the entire population around the building.  The postmaster of Hays, Mr. Hall, had once traded among the Cheyennes  and, understanding their sign-language, acted as interpreter. This  curious race has two distinct ways of conversing--one by mouth, in a  singularly unmusical dialect, and the other by motions or signs with the  hands. The latter is that most generally understood and employed by  scouts and traders.    [Illustration: THE PIPE OF PEACE--THE PROFESSOR'S DILEMMA.]    One of the Indians now took from a sack a red-clay pipe, with a  ridiculously long bowl and longer shank, and inserted into it a  three-foot stem, profusely ornamented with brass tacks and a tassel of  painted horse hair. This was handed to White Wolf, together with a small  bag of tobacco, in which the Killikinnick leaves had been previously  crumbled and mixed. These were a bright red, evidently used for their  fragrance, as they only weakened the tobacco without adding any  particular flavor. We were struck with the Indian mode of smoking.  The chief took a few quick whiffs, emitting the fumes with a hoarse  blowing like a miniature steam-engine. He then passed it, mouth-piece  down so that the saliva might escape, and it commenced a slow journey  around the circle. When it reached our worthy professor he found himself  in a sore dilemma. No smoke had ever curled along the roof of his mouth,  or made a chimney of his geological nose. For an instant the philosopher  hesitated; then, reflecting that passing the pipe would be worse than  choking over it, the excellent man put the stem to his mouth and gave a  pull which must have filled the remotest corner of his lungs with  Killikinnick. Gasping amid the stifling cloud, it poured from both mouth  and nose, and called on the way at his stomach, which gave unmistakable  symptoms of distress. We feared that he would be forced to forsake the  council, but, with an effort worthy of the occasion and himself, he kept  his seat, and opening wide his mouth, waited patiently until the fiend  of smoke had withdrawn from his interior its trailing garments.    The council disappointed us. In White Wolf we had found as fine-looking  an Indian as ever murdered and stole upon his native continent. His  people were first in war, first to break peace, and the last to keep it,  their excuse being that the white man trespassed on their hunting  grounds. We had rather expected that burly form to rise from his seat,  and, with flashing eyes, utter then and there a flood of aboriginal  eloquence: \"White man, your people live where the sun rises, ours where  it sets. When did you ever come to us hungry and be fed, or clothed and  go away so,\" and so on _ad infinitum_. Instead of all this there was a  tremendous smoking and grunting, more like a farmer's fumigation of hogs  than one of those pipe-of-peace councils which I had so often studied on  canvas and in books. I have often regretted since that our aborigines  can not read. If they could only learn from the white man's literature  what they ought to be, the contrast between it and what they really are  would be so violent that it might make an impression, even upon an  Indian.    For a happy mingling of lies and truth our \"big talk\" could hardly be  excelled. A reporter could have taken down the proceedings somewhat as  follows:    SCENE--Six Indians and as many white men in a ring. Postmaster Hall in  the center, acting as interpreter.    _Indian_--\"Cheyenne love white man much (lie). Forty-six warriors all  hungry (truth). Us good Indians\" (lie). And so on, alternately.    _Pale Brother_--\"White man love Cheyenne. Got lots of food, but no  whisky\" (the latter a lie which almost choked the speaker).    It would not interest the reader to know all the repetitions or nonsense  uttered, and we spare him the infliction of even attempting to tell him.  The Indians had for their object food, and they got it. The whites had  for their object permanent peace, and did not get it.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION BUFFALO_    WHITE WOLF AT HOME.    \"The red man is noble, big injun is me.\"]    In due time the council broke up, and in an incredibly short time  thereafter many of the Indians were reeling drunk. That White Wolf  did not become equally so was owing altogether to his being a man of  iron constitution. Any thing but metal, it seemed to me, must have been  burnt out by the fiery draughts which we saw the noble chief take down.  A tin cupful of \"whisk,\" such as would have made the cork in a bottle  tight, was tossed off without a wink.    Sachem, who took notes, rendered White Wolf's speech at the council in  verse, as follows:      White brother, have pity; the White Wolf is poor,      The skin of his belly is shrunk to his back;    A gallon of whisky is good for a cure,      If followed by plenty of \"bacon and tack.\"      The red man is noble, big Injun is me:      Like berries all crimson and ready to pick,    The scalps on my pole are a heap good to see--      Good medicine they when poor Injun is sick.      The red man is truth, and the white one is lies;      The first suffers wrong at hand of the other;    The way they skin us is good for sore eyes,      The way we skin them astonishing, rather.      They rob us of guns and offer us plows,      And tell us to farm it, to go into corn;    We're good to raise hair, and good to raise rows,      And good to raise essence of corn--in a horn.      Go back to your cities and leave us our home,      Or off with your scalp and that remnant of shirt;    Go, let the poor Injun in happiness roam,      And live on his buffalo, puppies, and dirt.    Two or three of the Indians mounted their ponies and took a race through  the streets. The animals were thin, despondent brutes, but as wiry as if  their hides were stuffed, like patent mattresses, full of springs. The  Indians, as is their universal custom, mounted from the right side,  instead of the left as we do. At the lower end of the street they got as  nearly in line as their inebriated condition would permit, and when the  word was given set off toward us with frightful shouts, which made the  ponies scamper like so many frightened cats.    The animal which came out ahead had no rider to claim the honors, that  blanketed jockey having fallen off midway. He was now sitting on his  hams, looking the wrong way down the track, and evidently adding up the  \"book\" which he had made for the race. As he soon arose, with a  dissatisfied grunt, we thought his figures probably read about as  follows:    Given--A gallon of Hays whisky in the saddle, and a race-horse under it.  Endeavor to divide the latter by a rawhide whip, and the result is a  sore-headed Indian, who stands forfeit to his peers for \"the drinks.\"    As we wandered back to the council-chamber, the scene there had changed  somewhat. White Wolf had been transformed into a cavalry colonel, and  was strutting around with two gilt eagles on his broad shoulders,  looking fully as important as many a real colonel whom we have caught in  his pin feathers and, withal, much more of the hero. Our warrior had  seen some of the officers from the fort strolling around, and  straightway fell to coveting his neighbors' straps, which observing,  Sachem at once purchased from a store the emblems of power and pinned  them upon him. He whispered to us that when White Wolf took his first  step as a colonel, it had been accompanied by a snort of pain, the  unlucky slipping of a pin having evidently"]]]
