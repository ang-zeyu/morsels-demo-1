Countries there are certainly to be found, where the  \"elements of temperature,\" are so fortunately balanced and combined as  to produce only good effects, and in which the rude inhabitants reap  the fruits of a spontaneous plenty; but these form only a small  proportion of the globe, and in most regions man must give his  unceasing endeavours to the cultivation of a plant or animal, before  he can raise it from the miniature condition in which he finds it, to  such a size and richness as will satisfy his wants. Nor need we go far  for illustrations. The crab has been transformed into the apple, and  the sloe into the plum. None of our cereal grasses, as now cultivated,  are to be met with in a wild state; they have evidently been brought  to their present fulness by the care of ages. The red cabbage and the  cauliflower are the altered descendants of a widely different sea-side  plant. The different races of cabbages are examples of a wonderful  deviation from the natural type, and they all require much nicety in  cultivation to prevent them assuming the characters of the original  stock, as, when permitted to grow wild, especially on a sterile soil  as that of the sea coast, they are sure in no long time to become  exact counterparts of their originals. Cultivation, also, though taken  in rather a different sense, influences to a great extent the form and  features of animals. In proof of this may be adduced the differences  that exist between different ranks of inhabitants in almost all  countries. Buffon says, that in France you may distinguish by their  aspect not only the nobles from the peasantry, but the superior orders  of nobility from the inferior--these from citizens, and citizens from  peasants. The African field-slaves in America, are extremely different  from the domestic servants of the former nation, retaining as they do  their original peculiarities from poor living and degrading duties;  while the latter have nearly approached to the habits and modes of  thinking of their masters, from living with them, and being well  treated under the same roof. \"The South Sea islanders,\" says Dr  Elliotson, \"who appear to be all of one family, vary according to  their degree of cultivation. The New Zealanders, for example, are  savages, and chiefly black; the New Hollanders half civilized, and  chiefly tawny; the Friendly islanders are more advanced, and not quite  so dark; several are lighter than olive colour, and hundreds of  European faces are found among them.\" Indeed the examples are almost  endless which I could bring forward to aid my explanations; but these  it would be needless to give, since it is in the power of every one to  study the differences in form and features of the classes of society  in our own island, and by so doing understand the influence of  otherwise trivial and unimportant circumstances, on an animal at all  times so easily moulded to situation as the sheep.    (86.) _Varieties from mode of Breeding._--Changes are wrought for the  most part by attention to the mode of propagation of the plant or  animal, by the plan of crossing; and by careful selection of the  parent stock. Every one must be struck with the varieties constantly  occurring in the vegetable world: Flowers change their colours, and  become double; and these characters can be perpetuated by seed.  Hedge-row plants may be observed to vary even in the limits of an  ordinary walk, and to be continued as varieties so long as they remain  in the same locality. The following striking example of the extent to  which plants may be made to vary by altering their circumstances, is  related by Mr Herbert in the _Horticultural Transactions_, vol.  iv:--\"I raised from the natural seed of an umbel of a highly manured  red cowslip, a primrose, a cowslip, oxlips of the usual and other  colours, a black polyanthus, a hose-in-hose cowslip, and a natural  primrose bearing its flower on a polyanthus stalk. From the seed of  that very hose-in-hose cowslip, I have since raised a hose-in-hose  primrose. I therefore consider all these to be only local varieties,  depending upon soil and situation.\" \"Fifty years ago,\" says Buffon  (writing in 1749), \"our pot-herbs consisted of a single species of  succory, and two of lettuce, both very bad; but we have now more than  fifty kinds of lettuce and succory, all of which are good. Our best  fruits and nuts, which are so different from those formerly cultivated  that they have no resemblance but in the name, must likewise be  referred to a very modern date. In general, substances remain, and  names change with times: but in this case names remain, and substances  are changed. Our peaches, our apricots, our pears, are new productions  with ancient names. To remove every doubt upon this subject, we have  only to compare our flowers and fruits with the descriptions, or  rather notices of them transmitted to us by the Greeks and Romans. All  their flowers were single, and all their fruit-trees were wild stocks,  and their species very ill-chosen. Their fruits of course, were small,  dry, sour, and had neither the flavour nor the beauty of ours. These  new and good species originally sprung from the wild kinds; but how  many times have their seeds been sown before this happy effect was  produced? It was only by sowing and rearing an infinite number of  vegetables of the same species, that some individuals were recognized  to bear better and more succulent fruit than others; and this first  discovery, which supposes much care and observation, would have  remained for ever useless if a second had not been made, which implies  an equal degree of genius as the first required of patience--I mean  the mode of multiplying by engrafting those precious individuals which  unfortunately cannot propagate or transmit their excellent qualities  to their posterity. * * * In the animal kingdom, most of those  qualities which appear to be individual are propagated and transmitted  in the same manner as their specific qualities. It was therefore more  easy for man to have influence upon the nature of animals than upon  that of vegetables. Particular races in any species of animals, are  only constant varieties, which are perpetuated by generation. But in  the vegetable kingdom there are no races, no varieties so constant as  to be perpetuated by reproduction. In the species of the hen and  pigeon, a great number of races have been very lately produced, all of  which propagate their kinds. In other species, we daily rear and  improve races by crossing the breeds.\"    (87.) _Breeding in-and-in._--Though there are several methods pursued  by breeders for the improvement of flocks, the one most in vogue is,  that of choosing individuals of the same family, and breeding  _in-and-in_. It is however a plan requiring, for the safety of the  flock, either very great skill in selecting the males and females, or  only to be followed to a very limited extent. No subject ever called  forth so much random controversy, and no evil has ever so clearly  shown itself as such; yet it is only recently, that people have opened  the intellectual eye to the dangers of a practice, against which the  ablest pens were long and vainly blunted. The object of breeding  _in-and-in_ is to strengthen good qualities and get rid of bad ones,  as speedily as possible; and it is plain, that if we happen to select  animals with slight imperfections, these imperfections will become  hereditary, and will go on assuming a worse and worse type till the  breed be destroyed. Culley, however, was of opinion, that less risk is  run by breeding _in-and-in_ than is generally supposed, and instances  the wild cattle in Chillingham Park, in the county of Northumberland,  which, having been confined for several hundred years without  intermixture, must have bred from the nearest affinities, and yet are  just as they were five hundred years since. With all due deference,  however, to the opinion of the late Mr Culley, I must assert, that I  cannot perceive in what manner wild cattle can be made to illustrate  the case in point, as it must be evident, that animals in a state of  nature differ essentially from those in charge of man, in regard to  the propagation of infirmities, as the former, if born with a radical  defect, will, ten to one, never see the age which suits them for  reproduction; while the latter, from the care bestowed upon them,  will, even when very delicate, in many instances be bolstered up till  they have entailed upon posterity an accumulation of their already  aggravated maladies. The system of breeding _in-and-in_ proves, in  fact, as destructive to flocks, as marriages of near relations to the  human kind. We would not witness an every-day entailment of diseases,  if people would forego their unnatural love of money, and cease their  endeavours to keep it in \"the family,\" by forming matrimonial  alliances with those who are near of kin. The law of God forbids us to  wed those who stand in certain degrees of propinquity; but, if we and  our descendants avail ourselves of the limits of this law, and marry  on its verge a certain number of times, misery must infallibly be the  lot even of the tenth generation; and instead of being fathers of a  mighty people, few and full of sorrow will be the days of our  children; while in place of retaining in their possession our darling  wealth, it will, ere long, pass into the hand of the stranger.    (88.) _Opponents of in-and-in breeding._--Different individuals at  various times, and in widely separate places, have by their  observations rendered the criminal absurdity of this system perfectly  apparent to all, who, unbiased by party principle, are anxious for a  knowledge of the truth. A few of these I shall mention. Ezra  L'Hommedieu, Vice-president of the Agricultural Society of New York,  collected, in the year 1800, a great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#19)"],[1," of danger and need; when a woman croons over her baby an  incantation to keep him honest and true, and that he shall be spared in  danger, surely these croonings are of the nature of prayers born of the  same elementary frame of mind as our more elaborate litany. I fancy  inherent devotional impulses are common to all races irrespective of  country or colour.    When the prayer was over the old men chanted Byamee's song, which only  the fully initiated may sing, and which an old black fellow chanted for  us as the greatest thing he could do.    There seemed very little in this song, for no, one can translate it,  the meaning having been lost in the 'dark backward,' if it was ever  known to the Euahlayi.      'Byamee guadoun.    Byamee guadoun.    Byamee guadoun.    Mungerh wirree.    Mungerh wirree.    Mungerh wirree.    Birree gunyah, birrie gunyah.    Dilbay gooran mulah bungarn.    Oodoo doo gilah.    Googoo wurra wurra.    Bulloo than nulgah delah boombee nulgah.    Delah boombee. Nulgah delah boombee boombee.    Buddereebah . . . . . . Eumoolan.    Dooar wullah doo. Boombee nulgah delah.'    The old fellow said wherever Byamee had travelled this song was known,  but no one now knew the meaning of the whole, not even the oldest  wirreenuns.    Another stone was given to a Boorahbayyi when he first heard this song.    The wirreenuns, they say, swallow their stones to keep them safe.    At each Boorah a taboo is taken off food. After a third Boorah a man  could eat fish, after a fourth honey, after a fifth what he liked. He  was then, too, shown and taught the meanings of the tribal  message-sticks, and the big Boorah one of Byamee. As few men now have  ever been to five Boorahs, few know anything about these last. At each  Boorah a stone was given to a man, and when he had the five he could  marry.    After each Boorah all the figures and embankments are destroyed.    After the fifth Boorah the mystery of the Gayandi was revealed and the  bull roarers shown--oval pieces of wood pointed at both ends, fastened  to a string and swung round; but though this was shown, the wirreenuns  told them that the spirit's voice was really in this wood animating it.  After a man has been to one Boorah he can have war weapons and is a  warrior, but not until he has been to five can he join or be one of the  dorrunmai--sort of chiefs--who hold councils of war, but have few  privileges beyond being accepted authorities as to war and hunting.  With the wirreenuns rests the real power, by reason of their skill in  magic.    Besides Boorahs are minor corroboree meetings where marriages are  arranged; meetings where the illegality of marriages is gone into, and,  if necessary, exchanges effected or arranged; meetings where the  wirreenuns of the Boogahroo produce the bags of hair, etc., and  vendettas are sworn; meetings of Boodther, or giving, where each person  receives and gives presents. A person who went to a Boodther without a  goolay full of presents would be thought a very poor thing indeed.    Of course every meeting has a corroboree as part of it.    Every totem even has its own special corroboree and time for having it,  as the Beewees, or iguanas, when the pine pollen is failing and the red  dust-storms come. And if you abused these dust-storms to a Beewee  black, you would insult him: it is not dust, it is the pollen off the  pines, and so a multiplex totem to him!    The winds belong to various totems, and the rains are claimed by the  totem whose wind it was that blew it up.    If a storm comes up without wind it belongs to Bohrah, the kangaroo.    The big mountainous clouds when they come from the south-west are said  to be Mullyan, the eagle-hawk, who makes the south-west wind claimed by  Maira, paddy melon totem, one of whose multiplex totems Mullyan is.    The crow keeps the cold west wind in a hollow log, as she was too fond  of blowing up hurricanes; she escapes sometimes, but the crow hunts her  back. But they say the log is rotting and she will get away yet, when  there will be great wreckage and quite a change in climates. [Here we see  the usual antagonism of crow and eagle-hawk.--A. L.]    Away to the north-west a tribe of blacks have almost a monopoly in  wind-making, holding great corroborees to sing these hurricanes up. One  of this tribe came to the station once and wanted to marry a girl  there. She would not consent, and told him to go home. He went,  threatening to send a storm to wreck the station. The storm came; the  house escaped, but stable, store, and cellar were unroofed. I told my  Black-but-Comelys to kindly avoid such vehemently revengeful lovers for  the future.          CHAPTER X    CHIEFLY AS TO FUNERALS AND MOURNING      I was awakened one morning on the station by distant wailing.    A wailing that came in waves of sound, beginning slowly and lowly, to  gain gradually in volume until it reached the full height or limit of  the human voice, when gradually, as it had risen, it fell again. No  shrieking, just a wailing inexpressibly saddening to hear.    I lay for some minutes not realising what the sound was, yet penetrated  by its sorrow. Then came consciousness. It was from the blacks' camp,  and must mean death. Beemunny, the oldest woman of the camp, who for  weeks had been ill, must now be dead.    Poor old Beemunny, who was blind and used to get her  great-granddaughter, little Buggaloo, to lead her up to the tree  outside my window, under whose shade she had spent so many hours,  telling me legends of the golden age when man, birds, beasts, trees,  and elements spoke a common language. But the day before I had been to  the camp to hear how she was. The old women were sitting round her; one  of the younger ones told me her end had nearly come.    The Boolees, or whirlwinds, with the Mullee Mullees of her enemies in,  had been playing round and through the camp for days, they said,  watching to seize her fleeting spirit--a sure sign the end was near.  That night surely would come Yowee, the skeleton spirit, with the big  head and fiery eyes, whose coming meant death.    Last night more than one of the blacks had dreamt of an emu, which  meant misfortune to one of that totem, which was Beemunny's.    As Yellen spoke in a hushed sad voice, suddenly, though no breath of  wind was stirring, sprang up on the edge of the camp a boolee, rearing  its head as if it were a living thing. Round it whirled, snatching the  dead leaves of the Coolabahs, swirling them with the dust it gathered  into a spiral column, which sped, as if indeed a spirit animated it,  straight to the camp of the dying woman. Round and round it eddied, a  dust-devil dancing a dance of death.    The watchers drew nearer to Beemunny, who was past heeding even the  spirits of evil.    The women in other camps clutched their children to them, but spoke no  word. All was silent but the swirling leaves as the column gathered  them. Finding the deathbed guarded, the boolee turned sharply from the  camp and sped away down the road, dissolving on the poligonum flat in  the distance.    Yellen gave a sigh of relief.    But now her fears were verified; Beemunny was dead.    Poor old Beemunny! How the vanities of youth cling to one; how we are  'all sisters under the skin.'    She was ever so old, she was blind, her face was scarred with wrinkles,  yet one of her beauties remained, and she absolutely joyed in its  possession: it was her hair. Her hair was thick and fuzzy, when combed  would stand nearly straight out, which is quite unusual with the native  women's hair in that part. Beemunny one day asked one of the younger  women if I had ever heard what a lot of lovers she had had in her  youth, what fights there had been over her, and all because of her  beautiful hair.    Poor old Beemunny! Something in my own woman nature went out to her in  sympathy. She was old, she was ugly, her husband was dead, as were all  men to her.    Poor old Beemunny! Having once learnt her vanity, I never passed her  without saying 'Gubbah Tekkul!' 'Beautiful hair!' at which she would  beam and toss her head.    At sunrise came again the wailing; the singing of the Goohnai, or  dirge, wherein are enumerated all the multiplex totems of the deceased,  crooned in a wailing way, and each fresh person who comes to the camp  sings this dirge again. In olden times all would have been painted in  full war paint, weapons in hand, to see the corpse.    I was given permission to go to the funeral, old Bootha was to take me.    I heard that Beemunny had died early in the night. Her daughter and  nearest of kin had sat all night beside her body, with each a hand on  it to guard her from the spirits. She was now in her bark coffin, round  which were her own blankets to be buried with her. The coffin was made  of bark cut off right round a tree, split on one side from end to end;  the body was placed in this, then the bark lapped over it, the ends  were blocked up with other pieces, the whole secured by ropes. All day  until the burial some one of kin stayed beside the coffin, little fires  of Budtha kept smoking all the while. In the afternoon old Bootha came  for me, and we set out.    First in the procession marched two old men of the tribe, behind them  some young men, then those in charge of the coffin and the two nearest  women relations, immediately behind them the old women, then the young  women. No women with babies were allowed to go, nor any children. I  came last with old Bootha.    The procession moved along an old winding track on the top of a  moorilla, or pebbly ridge, pine-trees overarching in places carving the  sky into a dome--a natural temple through which we walked to the  burial-ground.    Every now and then we heard a bird note, which made the women glance at  each other and say, first, 'Guadgee,' then 'Bootha,' as it came again,  and a third time 'Hippitha.' To my uneducated ear the note seemed the  same each time. I asked Bootha"]]]
