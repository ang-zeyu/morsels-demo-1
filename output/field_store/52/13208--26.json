The meeting could be put off no longer. It came, and in the same dear  old kitchen where they had worked together. The man looked straight  into her eyes and said, quietly:    \"Charity, I have done you and myself a great wrong. I shall try to do  better. God knows how hard I shall try--am trying! Will you forgive  me? Will you help me?\"    After all, she was hardly prepared for this, and though she began  bravely enough with, \"Mr. Ralston,\" she soon broke down altogether.  \"Of course,\" she told him, \"the wedding must be postponed  indefinitely. Further than that--I can't tell what--O Tom! how  could\"--she began afresh, but stopped at his look, and slowly walked  out of the room and house.      V    Slowly the long weeks of late winter succeeded each other, alike  monotonous, gray and dreary. Tom Ralston worked, at first manfully,  then doggedly, on the farm, fighting with a strong will against public  opinion and private temptation. Everybody had heard of his fall. Young  girls eyed him curiously from the opposite side of the road, and the  frequenters of the village store gathered at night to sit around the  stove, heels in air, and bring out stories of old Major Ralston, two  or three generations back, whose dissipations had been town talk; and  the gossips gravely wagged their heads and said: \"'Twas bound to crop  out sooner or later.\"    So passed the icy months, and song-sparrows and bluebirds began to  flit among the naked boughs like dreams of spring. Following them came  the robins, plump and cheery embodiments of summer. One morning in  April the maples and oaks stretched out their arms, full of rosy and  restless baby leaves born in the night. The heats of July parched the  land; September laid her gentle hand upon its brow until it was  refreshed and slept.    Still Tom Ralston worked on, through sun and shower, seed-time and  harvest, beginning at last to win approving nods and kindly smiles  and words from his self-appointed critics. Still Charity, with heavy  heart, went about her routine of household duties, from which all the  sweetness, the vague looking forward, the pretty, girlish longing  which had of late clothed them were gone. When she met Tom, as she was  often obliged to, she spoke not coldly indeed, but as to a mere  acquaintance. Right or wrong, she had conscientiously chosen her  course, and she would keep it to the end. She would never marry a man  who might become a drunkard, and perhaps leave his curse to be  inherited by his innocent children.    It was five days before Christmas when Charity, having finished her  daily tasks, stole away to spend the last hour or two of the short  winter afternoon in her favorite walk, an old logging-path through the  pine woods. The air was deliciously clear and sweet. Overhead, a flock  of chickadees called to her merrily, and hung upside down among the  tasseled boughs in search of insects and other small bird food. Not an  anxious search, by any means; rather a contented one, on the whole, as  if they were quite sure their daily bread had been given them, and  they were only to see that it was not wasted. Charity half  unconsciously took note of their happy little movements to and fro,  as, for the hundredth time, she went over and over the arguments  against forgiving Tom. She had just reached the triumphant \"lastly,\"  in her course of reasoning, when, suddenly startled by the breaking of  a twig, she glanced up, to see the subject of her syllogisms not  twenty feet away, gathering evergreen. Like the rushing waters of a  great tide, sweeping away her artificial landmarks and barriers, came  the overwhelming conviction that it was she, and not the man before  her, who needed forgiveness.    At the sound of her dress, Tom, too, had started up, as he did in the  cell a year ago; but presently went on with his task, stooping low  over a refractory vine of princess pine.    \"It was the least I could do,\" he said humbly, and with evident  effort. \"I shall take it up to the city myself and sell it for the  girls.\"    Something in her very silence, or perhaps a slight exclamation that  escaped her lips, made him look up. She stood there, alternately  paling and flushing, with a look in her eyes he had not seen for many  a long day. He sprang to his feet, but she put out her hand to check  him.    \"Tom,\" she began, with quivering lip, \"dear Tom, can you forgive\"--    What was the use of her hand then! If she had been surrounded by  Napoleon's Old Guard I believe Tom would have got at her somehow.  Forgive her! Bless you, if you had seen him for the next five minutes,  or had heard them talk as they walked home together beneath the pines,  you would have been puzzled to know which forgave or which was  forgiven, or which had done right or wrong, or whether either had ever  doubted the other for an instant of their lives.    \"'Suffereth long and is kind,'\" whispered grandmother that night,  stroking the girl's brown hair.    Of course Tom went home with her afterward, in the old way, and made  footprints again before her door, while the moon smiled to itself and  poured down its silvery blessing upon them.    So they had a merry Christmas after all, and a New Year's wedding, on  which occasion grandmother was resplendent in fresh ribbons, and the  girls laughed and cried by turns.    The hard, dreary year of Tom's struggle is long since past, but as  Christmastide draws nigh and the wreaths are hung at the windows,  Charity Ralston, the dearest and brightest little woman in all the  country, looks fondly into her husband's strong, manly face, and lays  her cheek upon his shoulder in a way that tells him she remembers. He,  too, has never forgotten, and, standing there in the twilight, with  the sweet Christmas incense of the evergreen about them, he tells her  again how he endured, and hoped, and loved, and ends by holding her  close in his arms, while she whispers, \"Merry Christmas, Tom!\"          XI    THROUGH THE STORM      I    \"'Lisbeth, 'Lisbeth, what ye doin' out there?\"    It was a sharp, high-strung voice, yet not loud nor ill-natured. The  speaker stood at an open door between the kitchen and an outer porch,  the latter built of rough boards and showing little wet streaks on the  floor, where the storm had thrust in its snowy fingers the night  before. The silence of the place was broken at intervals by a regular  series of dull blows, lasting two or three minutes and interspersed  with muffled splashings.    \"'Lisbeth, can't ye leave off churnin' a minute? I want my specs.\"    \"All right, father, I'll find 'em for ye: 's--almost--come!\" The last  words were emphasized by such an energetic pounding that the  window-sashes, with their small, old-fashioned panes, rattled like  cymbals.    \"There! there! ye needn't knock the bottom out'n the churn,\" said the  first speaker, with a movement among the wrinkles of his face that  betokened a smile. \"I c'n hold on a spell longer, I guess. Jest bring  me in a mug o' the buttermilk when ye've got threw.\" The keen air  swept through the porch and lifted the leaves of a yellow-covered  almanac that hung against the wall. The old man took it down from its  nail, and closed the door with a shiver. \"Wind's shiftin' back,\" he  mused. \"Soon's ever I git my glasses I'll see what the almanac says.  'T ain't much use fer Wesley to break out the road, even 'f the  Hill-folks _is_ comin'. 'Twill be over the walls 'fore the train's  in.\" He walked slowly to a pile of wood that lay near the fireplace,  paused before it a moment, with a shrewd look, whistling in a sort of  whisper, then picked out a stout birch stick with the bark hanging in  strips and laid it with great deliberation on the fire, which was  already crackling and roaring up the chimney in a broad blaze and  sending its generous glow to the farthest corner of the room.    A few moments later the door opened and showed a quiet little figure  and a cheery face that irresistibly suggested Thanksgiving, Christmas,  comfort, and reliableness, all in one. It was evident that if her  forty years or so had brought her many sorrows they had given a  wonderful inward peace and strength that is not afraid of evil  tidings. She was dressed plainly, with her sleeves rolled up to the  elbows. \"Here's your milk, father; and there's your glasses now, right  on top of your head,\" she said, stooping forward a little and speaking  in loud, clear tones.    \"Lor' sakes! so they be. I declare, I'm gittin' so forgitful, 'n' I  can't hear no one 'bout the house but you, 'Lisbeth. Strange how my  hearin' 's failed me this year! If't wa'n't for you\"--Here his voice  quavered a little, but he was happily interrupted by the entrance of a  broad-shouldered, clear-eyed young fellow, who advanced to the fire,  and, holding out his hands to its genial warmth, stamped off upon the  brick hearth a few bits of snow that had clung to his stout boots.    \"Well, grandfather, we've got a 'spell o' weather' this time,\" he  shouted. \"Old Bonny Beag has her nightcap on, and I saw two or three  flakes as I came in. 'Lisbeth,\" he continued, \"the visitors up at the  Hill won't any _more_ than get there to-day, I guess. Sam Fifield,  down at the depot, says he has orders to have a pung ready for a lot  of boxes and a sleigh for the women and children that are coming down  to Christmas. I've broken out as far as the Corner; beyond that it's  good roading for quite a piece. The steers are as near being tired out  as ever I saw them. Breakfast 'most ready?\"    In a few minutes more the table was pulled out from the wall, and a  chip thrust under one of its feet to offset the unevenness of the  floor. Upon the spotless cloth were set three blue china plates, with  pictures of stately castles rising from lambent seas and numerous  swans disporting themselves therein; then came brown-jacketed  potatoes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#19)"],[1,"of their time in conversation, and  visits, and assemblies, these COMPANIONABLE qualities, so to speak,  are of high estimation, and form a chief part of personal merit. In  countries where men live a more domestic life, and either are employed  in business, or amuse themselves in a narrower circle of acquaintance,  the more solid qualities are chiefly regarded. Thus, I have often  observed, that, among the French, the first questions with regard to a  stranger are, IS HE POLITE? HAS HE WIT? In our own country, the chief  praise bestowed is always that of a GOOD-NATURED, SENSIBLE FELLOW.    In conversation, the lively spirit of dialogue is AGREEABLE, even to  those who desire not to have any share in the discourse: hence the  teller of long stories, or the pompous declaimer, is very little  approved of. But most men desire likewise their turn in the  conversation, and regard, with a very evil eye, that LOQUACITY which  deprives them of a right they are naturally so jealous of.    There is a sort of harmless LIARS, frequently to be met with in company,  who deal much in the marvellous. Their usual intention is to please and  entertain; but as men are most delighted with what they conceive to be  truth, these people mistake extremely the means of pleasing, and incur  universal blame. Some indulgence, however, to lying or fiction is  given in HUMOROUS stories; because it is there really agreeable and  entertaining, and truth is not of any importance.    Eloquence, genius of all kinds, even good sense, and sound reasoning,  when it rises to an eminent degree, and is employed upon subjects of  any considerable dignity and nice discernment; all these endowments seem  immediately agreeable, and have a merit distinct from their usefulness.  Rarity, likewise, which so much enhances the price of every thing, must  set an additional value on these noble talents of the human mind.    Modesty may be understood in different senses, even abstracted from  chastity, which has been already treated of. It sometimes means that  tenderness and nicety of honour, that apprehension of blame, that dread  of intrusion or injury towards others, that Pudor, which is the proper  guardian of every kind of virtue, and a sure preservative against vice  and corruption. But its most usual meaning is when it is opposed  to IMPUDENCE and ARROGANCE, and expresses a diffidence of our own  judgement, and a due attention and regard for others. In young men  chiefly, this quality is a sure sign of good sense; and is also the  certain means of augmenting that endowment, by preserving their ears  open to instruction, and making them still grasp after new attainments.  But it has a further charm to every spectator; by flattering every man's  vanity, and presenting the appearance of a docile pupil, who receives,  with proper attention and respect, every word they utter.    Men have, in general, a much greater propensity to overvalue than  undervalue themselves; notwithstanding the opinion of Aristotle  [Footnote: Ethic. ad Nicomachum.]. This makes us more jealous of the  excess on the former side, and causes us to regard, with a peculiar  indulgence, all tendency to modesty and self-diffidence; as esteeming  the danger less of falling into any vicious extreme of that nature. It  is thus in countries where men's bodies are apt to exceed in corpulency,  personal beauty is placed in a much greater degree of slenderness, than  in countries where that is the most usual defect. Being so often struck  with instances of one species of deformity, men think they can never  keep at too great a distance from it, and wish always to have a  leaning to the opposite side. In like manner, were the door opened to  self-praise, and were Montaigne's maxim observed, that one should say as  frankly, I HAVE SENSE, I HAVE LEARNING, I HAVE COURAGE, BEAUTY, OR WIT,  as it is sure we often think so; were this the case, I say, every one  is sensible that such a flood of impertinence would break in upon us,  as would render society wholly intolerable. For this reason custom  has established it as a rule, in common societies, that men should not  indulge themselves in self-praise, or even speak much of themselves;  and it is only among intimate friends or people of very manly behaviour,  that one is allowed to do himself justice. Nobody finds fault with  Maurice, Prince of Orange, for his reply to one who asked him, whom he  esteemed the first general of the age, THE MARQUIS OF SPINOLA, said he,  IS THE SECOND. Though it is observable, that the self-praise implied is  here better implied, than if it had been directly expressed, without any  cover or disguise.    He must be a very superficial thinker, who imagines that all instances  of mutual deference are to be understood in earnest, and that a man  would be more esteemable for being ignorant of his own merits and  accomplishments. A small bias towards modesty, even in the internal  sentiment, is favourably regarded, especially in young people; and a  strong bias is required in the outward behaviour; but this excludes not  a noble pride and spirit, which may openly display itself in its full  extent, when one lies under calumny or oppression of any kind. The  generous contumacy of Socrates, as Cicero calls it, has been highly  celebrated in all ages; and when joined to the usual modesty of his  behaviour, forms a shining character. Iphicrates, the Athenian, being  accused of betraying the interests of his country, asked his accuser,  WOULD YOU, says he, HAVE, ON A LIKE OCCASION, BEEN GUILTY OF THAT CRIME?  BY NO MEANS, replied the other. AND CAN YOU THEN IMAGINE, cried the  hero, that Iphicrates WOULD BE GUILTY? [Footnote: Quinctil. lib. v. cap.  12.]--In short, a generous spirit and self-value, well founded, decently  disguised, and courageously supported under distress and calumny, is a  great excellency, and seems to derive its merit from the noble elevation  of its sentiment, or its immediate agreeableness to its possessor. In  ordinary characters, we approve of a bias towards modesty, which is  a quality immediately agreeable to others: the vicious excess of  the former virtue, namely, insolence or haughtiness, is immediately  disagreeable to others; the excess of the latter is so to the possessor.  Thus are the boundaries of these duties adjusted.    A desire of fame, reputation, or a character with others, is so far  from being blameable, that it seems inseparable from virtue, genius,  capacity, and a generous or noble disposition. An attention even to  trivial matters, in order to please, is also expected and demanded by  society; and no one is surprised, if he find a man in company to observe  a greater elegance of dress and more pleasant flow of conversation, than  when he passes his time at home, and with his own family. Wherein, then,  consists Vanity, which is so justly regarded as a fault or imperfection.  It seems to consist chiefly in such an intemperate display of our  advantages, honours, and accomplishments; in such an importunate and  open demand of praise and admiration, as is offensive to others, and  encroaches too far on their secret vanity and ambition. It is besides a  sure symptom of the want of true dignity and elevation of mind, which is  so great an ornament in any character. For why that impatient desire  of applause; as if you were not justly entitled to it, and might not  reasonably expect that it would for ever at tend you? Why so anxious to  inform us of the great company which you have kept; the obliging things  which were said to you; the honours, the distinctions which you met  with; as if these were not things of course, and what we could readily,  of ourselves, have imagined, without being told of them?    Decency, or a proper regard to age, sex, character, and station in the  world, may be ranked among the qualities which are immediately agreeable  to others, and which, by that means, acquire praise and approbation. An  effeminate behaviour in a man, a rough manner in a woman; these are ugly  because unsuitable to each character, and different from the qualities  which we expect in the sexes. It is as if a tragedy abounded in comic  beauties, or a comedy in tragic. The disproportions hurt the eye, and  convey a disagreeable sentiment to the spectators, the source of blame  and disapprobation. This is that INDECORUM, which is explained so much  at large by Cicero in his Offices.    Among the other virtues, we may also give Cleanliness a place; since  it naturally renders us agreeable to others, and is no inconsiderable  source of love and affection. No one will deny, that a negligence in  this particular is a fault; and as faults are nothing but smaller vices,  and this fault can have no other origin than the uneasy sensation which  it excites in others; we may, in this instance, seemingly so trivial,  clearly discover the origin of moral distinctions, about which the  learned have involved themselves in such mazes of perplexity and error.    But besides all the AGREEABLE qualities, the origin of whose beauty  we can, in some degree, explain and account for, there still remains  something mysterious and inexplicable, which conveys an immediate  satisfaction to the spectator, but how, or why, or for what reason,  he cannot pretend to determine. There is a manner, a grace, an ease, a  genteelness, an I-know-not-what, which some men possess above others,  which is very different from external beauty and comeliness, and which,  however, catches our affection almost as suddenly and powerfully. And  though this MANNER be chiefly talked of in the passion between the  sexes, where the concealed magic is easily explained, yet surely much  of it prevails in all our estimation of characters, and forms no  inconsiderable part of personal merit. This class of accomplishments,  therefore, must be trusted entirely to the blind, but sure testimony of  taste and sentiment; and must be considered as a"]]]
