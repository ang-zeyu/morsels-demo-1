The women of this  country are so enterprising and idolatrous, that they do marvellous  things for the love of their idols, in this manner. There are  amongst them young girls who desire to marry some man for whom they  have a liking, and one of these will promise her idol to do it a  great service if she should marry such a one whom she wishes for.  And if she marries that one, she then says to him, I have to make a  feast for such a god, and I have to offer my blood before I deliver  myself to you. And so they appoint a day for celebrating that feast.  And she takes a large waggon with oxen, and they fix it in a very  high crane, such as those with which they draw water, and they  fasten it to an iron chain with two iron hooks, and she comes out of  her house with great honour, accompanied by all her relations and  friends, men and women, with much singing and playing of  instruments, and many dancers and jesters; and she comes wrapped  very tightly round the waist with her white stuffs, covered from the  waist to the knees, the rest bare, and at the door of her house,  where the car stands, they lower the crane, and stick the two hooks  into her in the loins between the skin and the flesh, and put into  her left hand a small round shield, and a little bag with lemons and  oranges. They then raise the crane with great shouting and sound of  instruments, firing guns, and making other festal demonstrations:  and in this manner the car begins its march on the way to the house  of the idol to which the promise was made, and she goes suspended by  those hooks fastened into her flesh, and the blood runs down her  legs. And she continues to sing and shout for joy, and to strike  upon the shield, and to throw oranges and lemons to her husband and  to her relations, who go with her in this manner to the door of the  said house of prayer, where they take her down, and cure her, and  deliver her to her husband; and she gives at that place great alms  to the Bramans and offerings to the idols, and a great feast to as  many as accompanied her.    There are other persons also who offer the virginity of their  daughters to an idol, and as soon as they are ten years of age they  take her to a monastery and the house of prayer of that idol, with  great honour, and accompanied by her relations, entertaining her  like one that is going to be married. And outside of the monastery,  at the door, there is a bench of hard black stone, square, of half a  man's height, and surrounded with wooden steps, with many oil lamps  placed on the steps, which are lit at night.[184]           *       *       *       *       *    This King of Narsinga is frequently at war with the King of Dacani,  who has taken from him much of his land; and also with another  Gentile King of the country of Otira,[185] which is the country in  the interior. And he always sends his captains and troops to this  war, and on some occasions, if of necessity, he goes to the war in  person; and as soon as it is determined on, he goes out to the  country, on a certain day, on an elephant or in a litter, very  richly adorned with gold and jewels, accompanied by many knights and  horse and foot-men: and many elephants go before him, all covered  with scarlet cloth and silk, and much bedizened and dressed out as  for a feast. And as they go through the fields they bring the king a  horse, on which he rides, and a bow and an arrow, which he shoots  towards the part where he intends to go and make war. And they name  the day of his setting out, and this news immediately runs  throughout all the kingdom. He then pitches his tents and camp in  the country, and there remains until the appointed term of days is  accomplished for his departure. When this is concluded he orders the  city to be set on fire, and directs it all to be burned except the  royal palaces, castles, houses of prayer, and those of some of the  grandees which are not covered with thatch, in order that all may go  to the war to die with him, and with his wives and children, whom he  has with him in the wars. In order that these may not take to flight  he directs large pay to be given to all: in the first place, to the  enchanting single women, who are numerous, and who do not fight, but  their lovers fight for love of them very vigorously. And it is also  said that many men come from all the other kingdoms to this king's  camp for the love of these women,[186] amongst whom there are many  very honourable ones, great confidantes of the king, who come of  great houses, and are very rich. Each one of them keeps seven or  eight pretty waiting women, who are given to them by their mothers  to bring them up, and put them in the court enrolled on the pay  list. They hold this service in great honour, and it is but a short  time since one of them died who had no son nor heir, and left the  king for her heir; and he gathered from the inheritance sixty  thousand gold pardaos, besides twelve thousand which he gave to a  waiting woman of his, whom he had brought up from a girl: which is  not to be wondered at for the great wealth of the kingdom.    In this kingdom jewels are esteemed as treasure by the king and also  by the rich, who buy them at large prices. The people of this  kingdom are great hunters both of flying game and wild beasts. There  are many small hacks, and very good ones to go.      HOTISA.    Having passed the said kingdom of Narsynga inland, there is next  another kingdom called Hotisa,[187] which confines with it on one  side, and on another with the kingdom of Bengal, and on the other  with the kingdom of Dely: and it is inhabited by Gentiles. The king  is also a Gentile, very rich and powerful, who has many foot  soldiers; he is frequently at war with the kingdom of Narsinga, from  which he has taken lands and villages; and the King of Narsinga has  taken others from him: so that they are rarely at peace. Of the  customs of these people I have little information, on account of  their being placed so much in the interior of the country. It is  only known that in that country there are very few Moors, and that  they are almost all Gentiles and very good fighting men.      KINGDOM OF DELY.    Having passed this kingdom of Otisa, more inland there is another  great kingdom, which is called Dely, of many provinces, and of large  and rich cities of great trade. This kingdom is of the Moors, and  has a Moorish king, a great lord; and in former times this kingdom  was of the Gentiles, of whom there are still many who live amidst  the Moors, with much vexation. And many of them nobles and  respectable people, not to be subject to the Moors, go out of the  kingdom and take the habit of poverty, wandering the world; and they  never settle in any country until their death; nor will they possess  any property, since they lost their lands and property, and for that  go naked, barefooted, and bareheaded; they only cover their  nakedness with coverings[188] of brass, in this manner: it must be  said, that they wear belts of Moorish brass of pieces fitted  together, of four fingers in breadth, carved with many images of men  and women, sculptured and shining: and they wear it so tight that it  makes their guts rise high up; and from the girdle below the hips  there comes a bandage of the same brass, and in front it forms a  sort of braguette, which comes and fastens in the girdle in front  with its fastenings: all very tight. Besides this, they carry very  heavy chains round their necks, and waists, and legs; and they smear  all their bodies and faces with ashes. And they carry a small brown  horn at their necks, after the fashion of a trumpet, with which they  call and beg for food at the door of any house where they arrive:  chiefly at the houses of kings and great lords and at the temples;  and they go many together, like the gipsies.[189] They are  accustomed to stop very few days in each country. These people are  commonly called jogues, and in their own speech they are called  zoame, which means servant of God. They are brown, very well made  and proportioned, of handsome faces; they wear their hair without  ever combing it, and made into many plaits, wound round the head.  And I asked them many times why they went in this fashion. And they  answered me, that they wore those chains upon their bodies as  penance for the sin which they committed for allowing themselves to  be captured by such bad people as the Moors, and that they went  naked as a sign of dishonour, because they had allowed their lands  and houses to be lost, in which God brought them up; and that they  did not want more property since they had lost their own, for which  they ought to have died; and that they smeared themselves with ashes  in order to remind themselves perpetually that they were born of  earth and had to return again to the earth, and that all the  rest[190] was falsehood. And each one of them carries his little bag  of these ashes with him; and all the Gentiles of the country honour  them greatly, and receive from them some of these ashes, and put it  on their heads,[191] shoulders, and breasts, making a few lines with  it. And throughout all the country the Gentiles are in the habit of  doing this. And so also throughout all India among the Gentiles,  many of them turn jogues; but most of them are from the kingdom of  Dely. These jogues eat all meats and do not observe any idolatry,  and they mingle with all kinds of people: neither do they wash like  other Gentiles, except when the wish to do so comes to them.    In this kingdom of Dely there are many very good horses, which are  born and bred there. The people of the kingdom, both Moors and  Gentiles, are very good fighting men and good knights, armed with  many kinds of weapons; they are great bowmen, and very strong men;  they have very good lances, swords, daggers, steel maces, and  battle-axes, with which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#19)"],[1,"people alone?\"    \"Oh, woman, woman!\" I threw in helpfully.    \"Always interfering--\"    \"Rotten!\"    \"And backbiting--\"    \"Awful!\"    \"I shan't stand it.\"    \"I shouldn't!\"    \"Look here! On the next page she calls me a gaby!\"    \"It's time you took a strong line.\"    \"And in the very next sentence refers to me as a perfect guffin. What's  a guffin, Garny, old boy?\"    I considered the point.    \"Broadly speaking, I should say, one who guffs.\"    \"I believe it's actionable.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder.\"    Ukridge rushed to the door.    \"Millie!\"    He slammed the door, and I heard him dashing upstairs.    I turned to my letters. One was from Lickford, with a Cornish postmark.  I glanced through it and laid it aside for a more exhaustive perusal.    The other was in a strange handwriting. I looked at the signature.  \"Patrick Derrick.\" This was queer. What had the professor to say to me?    The next moment my heart seemed to spring to my throat.    \"Sir,\" the letter began.    A pleasant cheery opening!    Then it got off the mark, so to speak, like lightning. There was no  sparring for an opening, no dignified parade of set phrases, leading up  to the main point. It was the letter of a man who was almost too  furious to write. It gave me the impression that, if he had not written  it, he would have been obliged to have taken some very violent form of  exercise by way of relief to his soul.      \"You will be good enough to look on our acquaintance as closed. I have  no wish to associate with persons of your stamp. If we should happen to  meet, you will be good enough to treat me as a total stranger, as I  shall treat you. And, if I may be allowed to give you a word of advice,  I should recommend you in future, when you wish to exercise your  humour, to do so in some less practical manner than by bribing boatmen  to upset your--(_friends_ crossed out thickly, and _acquaintances_  substituted.) If you require further enlightenment in this matter, the  enclosed letter may be of service to you.\"      With which he remained mine faithfully, Patrick Derrick.    The enclosed letter was from one Jane Muspratt. It was bright and  interesting.      \"DEAR SIR,--My Harry, Mr. Hawk, sas to me how it was him upsetting the  boat and you, not because he is not steady in a boat which he is no man  more so in Combe Regis, but because one of the gentlemen what keeps  chikkens up the hill, the little one, Mr. Garnick his name is, says to  him, Hawk, I'll give you a sovrin to upset Mr. Derick in your boat, and  my Harry being esily led was took in and did, but he's sory now and  wishes he hadn't, and he sas he'll niver do a prackticle joke again for  anyone even for a banknote.--Yours obedly.,                                                JANE MUSPRATT.\"      Oh, woman, woman!    At the bottom of everything! History is full of tragedies caused by the  lethal sex. Who lost Mark Antony the world? A woman. Who let Samson in  so atrociously? Woman again. Why did Bill Bailey leave home? Once more,  because of a woman. And here was I, Jerry Garnet, harmless,  well-meaning writer of minor novels, going through the same old mill.    I cursed Jane Muspratt. What chance had I with Phyllis now? Could I  hope to win over the professor again? I cursed Jane Muspratt for the  second time.    My thoughts wandered to Mr. Harry Hawk. The villain! The scoundrel!  What business had he to betray me? ... Well, I could settle with him.  The man who lays a hand upon a woman, save in the way of kindness, is  justly disliked by Society; so the woman Muspratt, culpable as she was,  was safe from me. But what of the man Hawk? There no such  considerations swayed me. I would interview the man Hawk. I would give  him the most hectic ten minutes of his career. I would say things to  him the recollection of which would make him start up shrieking in his  bed in the small hours of the night. I would arise, and be a man, and  slay him; take him grossly, full of bread, with all his crimes  broad-blown, as flush as May, at gaming, swearing, or about some act  that had no relish of salvation in it.    The Demon!    My life--ruined. My future--grey and black. My heart--shattered. And  why? Because of the scoundrel, Hawk.    Phyllis would meet me in the village, on the Cob, on the links, and  pass by as if I were the Invisible Man. And why? Because of the  reptile, Hawk. The worm, Hawk. The dastard and varlet, Hawk.    I crammed my hat on, and hurried out of the house towards the village.        CHAPTER XVI    A CHANCE MEETING    I roamed the place in search of the varlet for the space of  half-an-hour, and, after having drawn all his familiar haunts, found  him at length leaning over the sea-wall near the church, gazing  thoughtfully into the waters below.    I confronted him.    \"Well,\" I said, \"you're a beauty, aren't you?\"    He eyed me owlishly. Even at this early hour, I was grieved to see, he  showed signs of having looked on the bitter while it was brown. His  eyes were filmy, and his manner aggressively solemn.    \"Beauty?\" he echoed.    \"What have you got to say for yourself?\"    \"Say f'self.\"    It was plain that he was engaged in pulling his faculties together by  some laborious process known only to himself. At present my words  conveyed no meaning to him. He was trying to identify me. He had seen  me before somewhere, he was certain, but he could not say where, or who  I was.    \"I want to know,\" I said, \"what induced you to be such an abject idiot  as to let our arrangement get known?\"    I spoke quietly. I was not going to waste the choicer flowers of speech  on a man who was incapable of understanding them. Later on, when he had  awakened to a sense of his position, I would begin really to talk to  him.    He continued to stare at me. Then a sudden flash of intelligence lit up  his features.    \"Mr. Garnick,\" he said at last.    \"From ch--chicken farm,\" he continued, with the triumphant air of a  cross-examining King's counsel who has at last got on the track.    \"Yes,\" I said.    \"Up top the hill,\" he proceeded, clinchingly. He stretched out a huge  hand.    \"How you?\" he inquired with a friendly grin.    \"I want to know,\" I said distinctly, \"what you've got to say for  yourself after letting our affair with the professor become public  property?\"    He paused awhile in thought.    \"Dear sir,\" he said at last, as if he were dictating a letter, \"dear  sir, I owe you--ex--exp----\"    He waved his hand, as who should say, \"It's a stiff job, but I'm going  to do it.\"    \"Explashion,\" he said.    \"You do,\" said I grimly. \"I should like to hear it.\"    \"Dear sir, listen me.\"    \"Go on then.\"    \"You came me. You said 'Hawk, Hawk, ol' fren', listen me. You tip this  ol' bufflehead into watter,' you said, 'an' gormed if I don't give 'ee  a poond note.' That's what you said me. Isn't that what you said me?\"    I did not deny it.    \"'Ve' well,' I said you. 'Right,' I said. I tipped the ol' soul into  watter, and I got the poond note.\"    \"Yes, you took care of that. All this is quite true, but it's beside  the point. We are not disputing about what happened. What I want to  know--for the third time--is what made you let the cat out of the bag?  Why couldn't you keep quiet about it?\"    He waved his hand.    \"Dear sir,\" he replied, \"this way. Listen me.\"    It was a tragic story that he unfolded. My wrath ebbed as I listened.  After all the fellow was not so greatly to blame. I felt that in his  place I should have acted as he had done. It was Fate's fault, and  Fate's alone.    It appeared that he had not come well out of the matter of the  accident. I had not looked at it hitherto from his point of view. While  the rescue had left me the popular hero, it had had quite the opposite  result for him. He had upset his boat and would have drowned his  passenger, said public opinion, if the young hero from  London--myself--had not plunged in, and at the risk of his life brought  the professor ashore. Consequently, he was despised by all as an  inefficient boatman. He became a laughing-stock. The local wags made  laborious jests when he passed. They offered him fabulous sums to take  their worst enemies out for a row with him. They wanted to know when he  was going to school to learn his business. In fact, they behaved as  wags do and always have done at all times all the world over.    Now, all this, it seemed, Mr. Hawk would have borne cheerfully and  patiently for my sake, or, at any rate for the sake of the crisp pound  note I had given him. But a fresh factor appeared in the problem,  complicating it grievously. To wit, Miss Jane Muspratt.    \"She said to me,\" explained Mr. Hawk with pathos, \"'Harry 'Awk,' she  said, 'yeou'm a girt fule, an' I don't marry noone as is ain't to be  trusted in a boat by hisself, and what has jokes made about him by that  Tom Leigh!'\"    \"I punched Tom Leigh,\" observed Mr. Hawk parenthetically. \"'So,' she  said me, 'you can go away, an' I don't want to see yeou again!'\"    This heartless conduct on the part of Miss Muspratt had had the natural  result of making him confess in self-defence; and she had written to  the professor the same night.    I forgave Mr. Hawk. I think he was hardly sober enough to understand,  for he betrayed no emotion. \"It is Fate, Hawk,\" I said, \"simply Fate.  There is a Divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will,  and it's no good grumbling.\"    \"Yiss,\" said Mr. Hawk, after chewing this sentiment for a while in  silence, \"so she said me, 'Hawk,' she said--like that--'you're a girt  fule----'\"    \"That's all right,\" I replied. \"I quite understand. As I say, it's  simply Fate. Good-bye.\" And I left him.    As I was going back, I met the professor and Phyllis. They passed me  without a look.    I wandered on in quite a fervour of self-pity. I was in one of those  moods when life suddenly seems to become irksome, when the future  stretches black and grey in front of one. I should have liked"]]]
