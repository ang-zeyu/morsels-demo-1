Nebulous and gruesome shreds of blue-fog like wraiths shifted over the  sea. Out of the sombre, heavy air began to issue a sound as of many  women sobbing. From the indistinct distance came moaning, crooning  voices. Sometimes hysterical wails of anguish rent the air, and now and  then frantic choruses shrieked some heart-aching despair. My impression  was that I was in a land of the sorrowful dead, some mid-strata of the  spirit world, where, in this gray-green twilight, formless things in the  distance moved to and fro.    There is, I believe, in the heart of every man, an instinctive respect  for sorrow. With muffled steps, I left the igloo and paced the  dreariness of ice, treading slowly, lest, in the darkness, I slip into  some unseen crevasse of the open sea. A strange and eerie sight  confronted me. Along the seashore, bending over the lapping black water,  or standing here and there by inky, open leads in the severed ice, many  Eskimo women were gathered. Some stood in groups of two or three. Bowed  and disconsolate, her arms about them, with almost every hundred steps,  I saw a weeping mother and her children. Standing rigid and stark,  motionless graven images of despair, or frantically writhing to and fro,  others stood far apart in desolate places, alone.    The dull, opaque air was tinged with a strange phosphorescent green,  suggestive of a place of dead things; and now, like the flutterings of  huge death-lamps, along the horizon, where the sun had sunk, gashes of  crimson here and there fitfully glowed blood-red in the pall-like sky.    To the left, as I walked along, I recognized Tung-wingwah, with a child  on her back and a bag of moss in her hand. She stood behind a cheerless  rock, with her face toward the faint red flushes of the sun. She stood  motionless. Big tears rolled from her eyes, but not a sound was uttered.  To my low queries she made no response. I invited her to the camp to  have a cup of tea, thinking to change her sad thoughts and loosen her  tongue. But still her eyes did not leave that last distant line of open  water. From another, I later learned that in the previous April her  daughter of five, while playing on the ice-foot, slipped and was lost in  the sea. The mother now mourned because the ice would bury her little  one's soul.    A little farther along was Al-leek-ah, a woman of middle age, with two  young children by her side. She was hysterical in her grief, now  laughing with a weird giggle, now crying and groaning as if in great  pain, and again dancing with emotions of madness. I learned her story  from a chatter that ran through all her anguish. Towanah, her first  husband, had been drawn under the ice, by the harpoon line, twenty years  ago. And though she had been married three times since, she was trying  to keep alive the memory of her first love. I went on, marveling at a  primitive fidelity so long enduring.    Still farther along towards the steep slopes of the main coast, I saw  Ahwynet, all alone in the gloomy shadow of great cliffs. Her story was  told in chants and moans. Her husband and all her children had been  swept by an avalanche into the stormy seas. There was a kind of wild  poetry in the song of her bereavement. Tears came to my eyes. The rush  of the avalanche, the hiss of the wind, the pounding of the seas, were  all indicated. And then, in heart-breaking tones, came \"blood of her  blood, flesh of her flesh, under the frozen waters,\" and other  sentiments which I could not catch in the undertone of sobs.    Cold shivers began to run up my spine, and I turned to retreat to camp.  Here was a scene that perhaps a Dante might adequately write about. I  cannot. I felt that I, an alien, was intruding into the realm of some  strange and mystic sorrow. I felt the sombre thrill of a borderland  world not human. These women were communicating with the souls of their  dead. To those who had perished in the sea they were telling, ere the  gates of ice closed above them, all the news of the past year--things of  interest and personal, and even of years before, as far back as they  could remember. Almost every family each year loses someone in the sea;  almost every family was represented by these weeping women, overburdened  with their own naive sorrow, and who yet strangely sought to cheer the  souls of the disconsolate and desolate dead.    Meanwhile, while the women were weeping and giving their parting  messages to the dead, the male members of the tribe, in chants and  dramatic dances, were celebrating, in the igloos, the important events  of the past year.    Inside, the igloos were dimly lighted with stone blubber lamps. These,  during the entire winter, furnish light and heat. The lamp consists of a  crescent-shaped stone with a concavity, in which there is animal oil and  a line of crushed moss as a wick. Lighted early in the season, for an  entire winter, these lamps cast a faint, perpetual, flickering light.  Shadows dance grotesquely about on the rounded walls. An oily stench  pervades the unventilated enclosure. In this weird, yellow-blackish  radiance the men engage in their fantastic dances. Moving the central  parts of their bodies to and fro, they utter weird sing-song chants.  They recite, in jerky, curious singing, the history of the big events of  the year; of successful chases; of notable storms; of everything that  means much in their simple lives. As they dance, their voices rise to a  high pitch of excitement. Their eyes flash like smoldering coals. Their  arms move frantically. Some begin to sob uncontrollably. A hysteria of  laughter seizes others. Finally the dance ends; exhausted, they pass  into a brief lethargy, from which they revive, their melancholia  departed. The women return from the shores of the sea; they wipe their  tears, and, with native spontaneity, forget their depression and smile  again.    While I was interested in the curious spectacles presented, the sunset  of 1907 to me was inspiration for the final work in directing the  completion of the outfit with which to begin the conquest of the Pole at  sunrise of 1908. Fortunately, I was not handicapped by the company of  the usual novices taken on Polar expeditions. There were only two of us  white men, and white men, at the best, must be regarded as amateurs  compared with the expert efficiency of Eskimos in their own environment.  Our food supply contained only the prime factors of primitive  nourishment. Special foods and laboratory concoctions and canned  delicacies did not fill an important space in our larder. Nor had we  balloons, automobiles, motor sleds or other freak devices. We did,  however, I have said, have what was of utmost importance, an abundance  of the best hickory and metal for the making of the sleds upon which our  destinies were vitally to depend.          FIRST WEEK OF THE LONG NIGHT    HUNTING IN THE ARCTIC TWILIGHT--PURSUING BEAR, CARIBOU AND SMALLER GAME  IN SEMI-GLOOM    VII    THE GLORY OF THE AURORA      The sun had dropped below the horizon. The gloom continued steadily to  thicken. Each twenty-four hours, at the approximate approach of what was  the noon hour when the sun had been above the horizon, the sky to the  south of us glowed with marvelous, subdued sunset hues. By this time our  work had gone ahead by progressive stages. Furs, to protect us from the  cold of the uttermost North on my prospective trip, had been prepared  and were being made into clothing; meat and fat, for food and fuel, were  being dried and stored in numerous caches about Annoatok; several of the  sledges and part of the equipment were ready.    We still had need of large quantities of supplies, and, while some of  the natives were busy with their routine work, we planned that as many  others as possible should use the twilight days pursuing bear, caribou,  fox, hare and other game far beyond the usual Eskimo haunts. Before the  dawn of the sun's afterglow, on the morning of October 26, seven sledges  with sixty dogs were on the ice-foot near our camp, ready to start for  hunting grounds near Humboldt Glacier, a distance of one hundred miles  northward.[7]    While the teamsters waited for the final password the dogs chafed  fiercely. I could barely see the outlines of my companions in the gloom,  and it was difficult, in the irregular snow and tide-lifted ice  descending to sea level, to find footing.    The word to start was given. My companions took up the cry.    \"_Huk! Huk! Huk!_\" (Go! Go!) they shouted.    The dogs responded in leaps and howls.    \"_Howah! Howah!_\" (Right! Right!) \"_Egh! Egh!_\" (Stop! Stop!)  \"_Aureti!_\" (Behave!) came echoingly along the line of teams. Finally  the wild dash slackened, the dogs regulated their paces to an easy trot,  and we swept steadily along the frozen highway of the tide-made shelf of  the ice-foot. The sledges dodged stones and ice-blocks, edged along  dangerous precipices, in the depths of which I heard the swish of water,  and glided miraculously over crevices and along deep gorges. Jumping  about the sledges, guiding, pushing, or retarding their speed, cracking  their whips in the air, the natives, with that art which only aborigines  seem to have, picked the way and controlled the dogs, but a few  generations removed from their wolf progenitors, with amazing dexterity.    A low wind blew down the slopes and froze our breath in lines of frost  about our heads. The temperature was 35 deg. below zero. To the left of us  was Kane Basin, recalling its history of human strife northward. It was  filled with serried ranges of crushed ice, a berg here and there, all in  the light of the kindling sky, aglow with purple and blue. To the far  west I saw the dim outline of Ellesmere, my promised land, over which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#19)"],[1,"his retreat from the Genesee in '79. Brant, who had plenty  of powder, ordered his American prisoners to load and fire this gun a  number of times, the Indians meanwhile yelling in delight and the  Tories and British enjoying the chagrin of the helpless Americans. Then  the march was resumed; over the watershed to Cayuga Lake, which they  crossed on the ice near the outlet, a long train, each man far from his  fellow, for the ice was rotten and full of air-holes; then along the old  trail to Seneca River, which they forded; thence the route was west by  north, one camp being somewhere between the present villages of Waterloo  and Lyons. Brant on this expedition appears to have kept to the north of  Kanadasaga.[23] A day later they came to the outlet of Canandaigua Lake,  where the Indians, finding a human head which they said was the head of  a Yankee, had an improvised game of football with it, with taunts and  threats for the edification of their prisoners. The next day they  crossed the Genesee River, at or near the old Genesee Castle. And still,  as throughout all this march, unsalted, often uncooked, samp was their  only food.    On the march Davy and each of his fellows had worn about their necks a  rope of some fourteen or sixteen feet in length. In the daytime these  ropes were wound about their necks and tied. At night they were unwound,  each prisoner placed between two captors, and one end of the rope was  fastened to each of the double guard. Under the circumstances it is no  reflection upon our hero's courage that he had not made his escape.    West of the Genesee, and beyond the country which had been ravaged by  Sullivan, signs of Indian occupancy multiplied; but as yet there was no  other food than corn to be had for their ill-conditioned bodies. As they  filed along the trail, through the snow and mud of March, they met  another large party just setting out from Niagara on a foray for  prisoners and scalps. There were noisy greetings and many exultant  yells; and as the outbound savages passed the prisoners, they snatched  from each one's head the raccoon-skin cap; so that for the rest of the  journey Davy and his companions met the weather bare-headed--all save  Corporal Betts, to whom again was still spared the old three-cornered  hat. The incident bespeaks either the lack of control or the negligent  good nature of Brant, for fifteen raccoon-skins at Fort Niagara would  surely have been worth at least fifteen quarts of rum. Corporal Betts,  however, must have got little comfort out of his hat; for seeing him  look so soldierly in it, the whim seized upon Brant to compel the  unlucky corporal to review his woebegone troops.    \"Drill your men,\" said the fun-loving chief, \"and let us see if these  Yankees can go through the tactics of Baron Steuben.\"    And so poor Betts, but with a broken spirit, mustered his forlorn guard,  dressed them in a straight line, and put them through the manual  according to Steuben. I doubt if the history of Western New York can  show a stranger military function than this reluctant muster of patriot  prisoners under compulsion of a playful tiger of an Indian, jeered at  meanwhile by British soldiers from Fort Niagara. When these latter went  too far in their ridicule Brant stopped them. \"The Yankees,\" he said  angrily, \"do it a damned sight better than you can.\"    This affair took place, as nearly as I can make out, somewhere between  Batavia and Lockport; probably not far from the old Indian village of  Tonawanda.    Being now in the valley of the Tonawanda, Brant seems to have sent ahead  a runner to announce his approach; for the second or third day after  crossing the Genesee they were met by a party from the fort, bringing  pork and flour, whereupon there was a camp and a feast; with the not  strange result that many of them had to return to the astringent parched  corn as a corrective.    From this point on Davy and his friends were subjected to a new  experience; for, as they passed through the Indian villages, the old  women and children exercised their accustomed privilege of beating and  abusing the prisoners. On one occasion, as Davy was plodding along the  path, a squaw ran up to him, and, all unawares, hit him a terrific blow  on the side of the head, whereupon the boy came near getting into  trouble by making a vigorous effort to kick the lady. At another time,  as David marched near Brant, he saw a young Indian raise a pole,  intending to give the prisoner a whack over the head. Davy dodged, and  the blow fell on Brant's back. The chief, though undoubtedly hurt, paid  no attention to the Indian lad, but advised Davy to run, and Davy,  knowing perfectly well that to run away meant torture and death, wisely  ran towards the fort, which was but a few miles distant. A companion  named Hawkins, who had marched with him, ran by his side. And, as they  ran, they came upon still another village of the Senecas, from which two  young savages took after them. Believing that their pursuers would  tomahawk them, the boys let out a link or two of their speed, and coming  to a creek where logs made a bridge, Hawkins hid under the bridge, while  Davy ran behind a great buttonwood tree. The young Indians, however, had  seen them, and on coming up, one of them promptly went under the bridge,  and the other around the tree for Davy. This Indian held out his hand in  friendship, and said: \"Brother, stop.\" And the boys, seeing that the  Indians had no tomahawks and could do them no harm, were reassured, and  they all went on together toward Fort Niagara.    Soon they met a detail of soldiers from the fort, who detained them  until the rest of the party came up, when Davy saw that some of his  friends had been so badly wounded by the assaults of these village  Indians that they were now being carried. As the party went on together,  the path was continually lined with Indians, whose camps were on the  open plains about the fort; and the clubbing and beating of the  prisoners became incessant. This was all a regular part of a triumphal  return to Fort Niagara of a party of British and Indians with American  prisoners, and was the mild preliminary of that dread ordeal known as  running the gauntlet.    When Davy, well to the front of the procession, had been marched some  distance farther through the wood, he looked out upon a clearing, across  which extended a long line of fallen trees, which lay piled with the  butts inward, so that the sharpened points of the forked branches all  pointed outwards, making a _chevaux-de-frise_ upon which one might  impale himself, but which could scarcely be scaled. Beyond this barrier,  as Davy looked, he saw, first, the wagon road which ran between this  _chevaux-de-frise_ and the palisades or pickets of the fort beyond.  Within the palisades he could see the outlines of the fortification, the  upper part of the old castle which still stands there, and other  buildings, and over all the red flag of Great Britain. But while he  noted these things, his chief regard must have fallen upon the great  crowd of Indians who were ranged along on either side of the road  between the outwork of fallen trees and the palisades--two close ranks  of painted savages in front, and behind them on either side a dense mass  of yelling, gesticulating bucks, squaws, old men and children, impatient  for the passing of the prisoners. Beyond, the British sentries, officers  and other inmates of the fort, awaited the sport, like spectators at a  play.    Davy knew the gravity and the chances of the situation. He knew the  Indian custom, which does not seem to have been at all interfered with  by the officers in command at Niagara,[24] which allowed the spectator  to assault or wound the prisoner who should run between the ranks, in  any way which his ingenuity could suggest, except with hatchets and  knives; these could be used only on prisoners whose faces were painted  black, by which sign wretches doomed to death were known; yet any  prisoner, even the black-painted ones, who lived through the gauntlet  and gained the gate of the fort, was safe from Indian judgment, and  could rest his case upon the mercies of the British.    I do not know whether or not Davy's heart stood still for a second, but  I am bound to say there was not a drop of craven blood in his veins. He  was not exactly in training, as we would say of a sprinter today--his  diet, the reader will remember, had been somewhat deficient. But if he  hesitated or trembled it was not for long. We can see him as he stands  between the soldiers from the fort--bareheaded, ragged, dirty; a blanket  pinned about his shoulders and still with the rope about his neck by  which he was secured at night. And now, as his guards look back to see  the others come up, Davy tightens the leather strap at his waist, takes  a deep breath, bends low, darts forward, and is half way down the line  before the waiting Indians know he is coming.    How he does run! And how the yells and execrations follow! There is a  flight of stones and clubs, but not one touches the boy. One huge  savage steps forward, to throw the runner backward--he clutches only the  blanket, which is left in his hands, and Davy runs freer than before.  The twenty rods of this race for life are passed, and as the boy dashes  upon the bridge by which the road into the fort crosses the outer ditch,  he is confronted by an evil-looking squaw, who aims a blow with her fist  square at his face. Davy knocks up her arm with such force that she  sprawls heavily to the ground, striking her head on one of the great  spikes that held the planking. And straight on runs Davy, not down the  road along the wall to the place set for prisoners, but through the  inner gate, under the guard-house; and so, panting and spent, out upon  the old parade-ground.    Thus came the boy-soldier of the Revolution, David Ogden, to Fort  Niagara, 118 years ago.    The sentries"]]]
