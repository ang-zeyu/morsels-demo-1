She was grateful for the money, and was only too  glad to go to work for Henry; she would have done it long ago if she had  only known what to do. We then parted, and I have never seen the woman,  since that day.    This business transacted, I at once returned to my practice at  Biddeford. Among my patients was a wealthy widow, \"fat, fair, and  forty,\" and I had not attended her long before a warm affection sprung  up between us, and in time, when the widow recovered, we began to think  we were in love with each other. I confess that I agreed to marry  her; but it was to be at some distant day--a very distant day as I  intended--for, strange as it may seem, and as it did seem to me, I had  at last learned the lesson that I had better let matrimony alone. I had  married too many wives, widows, milliners, and what not, already,  and had suffered too severely for so doing. I meant that my Vermont  imprisonment, the worst of all, should be the last.    So I only \"courted\" the widow, calling upon her almost every day, and  I was received and presented to her acquaintances as her affianced  husband. Her family and immediate friends were violently opposed to the  match, thereby showing their good sense. I was also informed that they  knew something of my previous history, and I was warned that I had  better not undertake to marry the widow. Bless their innocent hearts! I  had no idea of doing it. I was daily amazed at my own common sense. My  memory was active now; all my matrimonial mishaps of the past, with all  the consequences, were ever present to my mind, and never more present  than when was in the company of the fascinating widow. As for her,  the more her relatives opposed the match, the more she was bent upon  marrying me. Her family, she, said, were afraid they were going to lose  her property, but she would never give them a cent of it, anyhow, and  she would marry when and whom she pleased.    Not \"when,\" exactly; because, as she protested she would marry me, I  had something to say about it; I had been run away with by a milliner  in Vermont, and I had no idea of beings forcibly wedded by a widow in  Maine. I pleaded that my business was not sufficiently established; I  was liable to be called away from time to time; I had affairs to arrange  in New York and elsewhere before I could settle down; and so the happy  day was put off to an indefinite future time.    By-and-by I had business in Boston, and the widow declared that she  would go with me; she wanted to visit her friend's there and do some  shopping; and without making particular mention of her intention to her  relatives, she went with me, and we were in Boston together more  than two weeks. At the end of that time she returned to Biddeford and  notified her friends treat she was married to the doctor, though she had  no certificate, not even a Troy one, to show for it.    I deemed it advisable not to go back with her, but went to Worcester for  a while. In a few days I went to Biddeford, keeping somewhat close, for  I did not care to meet any of the relatives, and at night I called upon  the widow. She told me that her family had raised a tremendous fuss  about me, and had learned as much as they, and indeed she, wanted to  know about my adventures in Vermont and New Hampshire. They had not gone  back of that, but that was enough. It was dangerous, she told me, for me  to stay there; I was sure to be arrested; I had better get away from the  place as soon as possible. We might meet again by-and-by, but unless I  wanted to be arrested I must leave, the place that very night. She gave  me seven hundred dollars, pressed the money upon me, and I parted from  her, returning to Worcester, and going from there to Boston. Besides  what the widow bad given me, I had made more than one thousand dollars  in Maine, and was comparatively well off.    Then came the joyful intelligence that Henry was released. His mother  had worked for him night and day. She bad drawn up a petition, secured  a large number of sterling signatures, had gone with her counsel to see  the Governor, had presented the petition and all the facts in the case,  and the Governor had granted a pardon. Henry served only six months of  the eighteen for which he was sentenced, and very soon after I received  word that he was free, he came to me in Boston, stayed a few days, and  then went home to his mother in Unadilla.    With the release of my son, I considered the Scheimer account closed,  and I have never made any effort to see Sarah or our boy since that  time.    From Boston I went to Pittsford, Ontario County, N. Y., where I had many  friends, who knew nothing about any of my marriages or misfortunes, my  arrests or imprisonments. I went visiting merely, and enjoyed myself so  much that I stayed there nearly three months, going about the country,  and practicing a little among my friends. I was never happier than I was  during this time. I was free from prisons, free from my wives, and  free from care. As a matrimonial monomaniac I now looked upon myself as  cured.    Among the friends whom I visited in Ontario County, and with whom I  passed several pleasant weeks, were two cousins of mine whom I had not  seen for many years, since we were children in fact, but who gave me a  most cordial welcome, and made much of me while I was there. They knew  absolutely nothing of my unhappy history--no unpleasant rumor even  respecting me, had ever penetrated that quiet quarter of the State. I  told them what I pleased of my past career, from boyhood to the present  time, and to them I was only a tolerably successful doctor, who made  money enough to live decently and dress well, and who was then suffering  from overwork and badly in need of recuperation. This, indeed, was the  ostensible reason for my visit to Ontario. I was somewhat shattered; my  old prison trials and troubles began to tell upon me. I used to think  sometimes that I was a little \"out of my head;\" I certainly was so  whenever I entered upon one of my matrimonial schemes, and I must have  been as mad as a March hare when I attempted to kidnap Sarah Scheimer's  boy. After all the excitement and suffering of the past few years, I  needed rest, and here I found it.    My cousins were more than well-to-do farmers; they were enormously  rich in lands and money. Just after the war of 1812, their father,  my uncle, and my own father, had come to this, then wild and almost  uninhabited, section of the State to settle. Soon after they arrived  there my father's wife died, and this loss, with the general loneliness  of the region, to say nothing of the fever and ague, soon drove my  father back to Delaware County to his forge for a living, and to the  day of his death he was nothing more than a hard-working,  hand-to-mouth-living, common blacksmith.    But my uncle stayed there, and, as time went on, he bought hundreds of  acres of land for a mere song, which were now immensely valuable, and  had made his children almost the richest people in that region. My  Cousins were great farmers, extensive raisers of stock, wool-growers,  and everything else that could make them prosperous. There seemed to be  no end to their wealth, and their fiat farms, spread out on every side  as far as the eye could see.    And if my father had only stayed there, I could not help but think what  a different life mine might have been. Instead of being the adventurer  I was, and had been ever since I separated from my first and worst  wife--doing well, perhaps, for a few weeks or a few months, and then  blundering into a mad marriage or other difficulty which got me into  prison; well-to-do to-day and to-morrow a beggar--I, too, might  have been rich and respectable, and should have, saved myself a world of  suffering. This was but a passing thought which did not mar my visit,  or make it less pleasant to me. I went there to be happy, not to be  miserable, and for three months I was happy indeed.    From there I went to my birthplace in Columbia County, revisiting old  scenes and the very few old friends and acquaintances who survived, or  who had not moved away. I spent a month there and thereabouts, and at  the end of that time I felt full restored to my usual good health, and  was ready to go to work again, not in the matrimonial way, but in my  medical business, that was enough for me now.        CHAPTER XIV. MY OWN SON TRIES TO MURDER ME.

Where to go, not what to do, was the next question. Wherever I might go  and establish myself, if only for a few days, or a few weeks, I was sure  to have almost immediately plenty of patients and customers enough for  my medicines--this had been my experience always--and unfortunately for  me, I was almost equally sure to get into some difficulty from which  escape was not always easy. Looking over the whole ground for a fresh  start in business, it seemed to me that Maine was the most favorable  place. Whenever I had been there I had done well; it was one of the very  few States I had lived in where I had not been in jail or in prison; nor  had I been married there, though the Biddeford widow did her best to wed  me, and it is not her fault that she did not succeed in doing it.    To Maine, then, I went, settling down in Augusta, and remaining there  four months, during which time I had as much as I could possibly attend  to, and laid by a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#19)"],[1,"file will cut you.\"    \"How,--do not trifle with me,--what is this which you are telling me?\"    \"Indeed, sir,--indeed, it is all true,\" said the other, half frightened  at the effect his words had produced upon the prisoner, who now stepped  away from him and stood aloof, withdrawing his wrists from the operation  which Leonard Hust was performing.    \"Come hither, Leonard Hust, if that be your name,\" he said; \"sit here  and tell me what this business is that you refer to. No blind hints,  sir, but speak out plainly, and like a man.\"    Thus interrogated, the man did as he was directed, and went on to tell  the commander of the \"Sea Witch\" his story, up to the time when he was  lost to his parents and friends. How he had never been kindly treated by  his elder brother, who, indeed, drove him from home by his incessant  oppression. He referred to that last gallant act he had performed, by  saving his mother's favorite dog, and how little cousin Helen (she is  the same as Miss Huntington) had seen it all, and had thanked him over  and over again for it, and a thousand other reminiscences, thread by  thread, and link by link, filling up the space from earliest childhood  to the hour when he had left his home at Bramble Park.    As he went on relating these things, in the same old natural voice that  he had poured into the same ears from their infancy, until nearly ten  years had passed, a long-closed vein of memory seemed gradually to open  in the prisoner's brain; he covered his face with his hands, and for a  few moments seemed lost in connecting the various threads of the past,  until gradually it all came plainly and clearly back to him. His memory  had again by these hints become completely restored, he was himself  again!    \"Leonard, Leonard, I see all, remember all,\" he said, while a tear, a  man's tear, wet for a single moment his bronzed cheek.    \"I am rejoiced, sir, to hear it, I am sure,\" said the other.    \"But, Leonard, where is my brother, and why is it necessary to remove  these badges of shame by stealth? Tell me, where is Robert?\"    \"Alas, sir, you must remember that he never held a brother's regard for  you; it was that very thing which drove you from us when you were a wee  bit of a boy.\"    \"True, true; but he must see the hand of Providence in all this, and I  know he will give me his hand, and we will forgive each other and forget  the past.\"    \"Alas! sir, I always befriended you at home, when master Robert had set  both the old folk against you, and I would do so now; but as to him,  sir, I am sorry to say it, but he's a bad man, and he makes all those  who are with him bad men, and I have many a sad thing at heart that I  have been guilty of by following his orders, sir. No, no, master  Charles, take my advice, don't trust Robert,--make your escape, or you  will be hanged at the yard-arm of this very ship ere another twenty-four  hours have passed!\"    \"Is he capable of this?\" asked the younger brother, in tones of  amazement.    \"Nobody should know better than I, sir, and I tell you yes.\"    \"My blood, then, shall not be upon his hands,\" said Charles, musing, \"I  will escape. Come, good Leonard, relieve me of these shackles, and  quickly.\"    \"Slowly, slowly, master Charles, we must be cautious, there are watchful  eyes on board the ship, and sentries who know their duty, so be wary.\"    The young commander seemed now to stand more erect, there was a freer  glance to his eye, his lips were more compressed and firm, he felt that  what had been to him heretofore an indelible stain, a stigma upon his  character, was now effaced; he was not only respectably born, but even  gently and highly so. His father was knighted by his king, his blood was  as pure and ancient as any in England. He could now take Helen  Huntington to his heart without shame; he could boldly plead a cause  that he had not before dared to utter; he could refer her to the dear  hours of their childhood, to the tender kiss she gave him when he left  that distant home to become a wanderer over half the globe!    He no longer felt the irons that Leonard Hust was filing away. He seemed  to feel a strength that would have snapped them like pack threap. He was  a man now, a free man, and not a thing of accident; a thing for the  world to point at in scorn, not an abandoned child of shame. No, he felt  nerved at once by this singular, this almost miraculous discovery, and  could hardly restrain his impatience. Yet a shadow for a moment crossed  over his brow, as he thought of that brother, who could coldly look on  and see him sacrificed, knowing what he must and surely did know. Could  he have permitted such a result, had he been in Robert's place? Indeed,  he felt he could not.    \"Does not my brother know that you are here on this errand, Leonard?\"    \"If he did it would cost me my life,\" said the honest fellow.    Charles would have placed some favorable construction upon the case,  but, alas, he could not; there was no possible way of disguising the  matter. Robert was the same bitter, jealous-spirited soul that had  rendered his childhood miserable. Time had not improved him,--it was his  nature and could not be eradicated. Charles now realized this, and  within a few further inquiries of Leonard, touching matters of vital  interest to him, he resolved not to seek Robert, as he had at the outset  intended, neither would he avoid him. He knew no other person save him  could bring a continuance of the suit against him, but he hardly feared  that even he would do that.    \"Of course Helen Huntington knows nothing of this development yet,  Leonard?\"    \"No, sir, and master Robert bid me be careful not to let her find it  out, or to say one word about the matter to any one whatever. I wonder  the lady didn't know you, sir.\"    \"You forget that even Robert did not recognize me.\"    \"And that, too, seemed funny to me. Why, sir, I seemed to know you the  instant I set eyes on you in the court, and when I got close I soon  settled the doubt in my mind.\"    \"Well, my good fellow, it seems that but for you I might have been  hanged, and that, too, by my own bother; but I trust all is set right  now.\"    \"I hope so, sir, only you must not let master Robert know that I  liberated you from these ruffles, sir, will you, master Charles?\"    \"Never fear me, Leonard, I shall not do as you were about to do towards  me, give testimony that will in any way criminate you.\"    \"But I wasn't, sir, of my own free will, only master Robert had told me  what I must say, and stick to it, and swear to it through thick and  thin, and I'm afraid not to obey him.\"    \"Poor fellow, I see you are, indeed, his tool; but if I find myself in  any sort of a position ere long, I will take care to make your situation  more comfortable.\"    \"Thank ye, sir,\" said Leonard Hust, just as the last shackle dropped  from the prisoner's wrists.    In the mean time, let us turn for a moment to the bedside of Captain  Robert Bramble, for it is long past midnight, and, weary in mind and  body, he had retired to that rest which he most certainly needed. But  sleep is hardly repose to the guilty, and he was trebly so. Phantoms of  all imaginable shapes flitted across his brain, pictures of suffering,  of misery and of danger, to all of which he seemed to be exposed, and  from which he had no power to flee. Alas, how fearful the shadows that  haunt a bad man's pillow. He writhed like one in physical pain, tossed  from side to side, while the cold perspiration stood in big drops upon  his brow and temples.    Now his dreams carry him back, far back a score of years, to his  childhood at Bramble Park, when all was innocence, and then, with  leaping strides, he finds himself, years after, even as to-day, bearing  deadly witness against his brother. His dead father seems standing by  his bedside, pointing at him a warning finger, and sadly chiding his  fearful want of feeling. He tosses and turns and writhes again, then  leaping from the uneasy bed, looks bewildered around, and half grows  alarmed. Quickly he wraps a dressing-gown about him, and hastily walks  back and forth to still the agony of feeling and the bitter phantoms of  his dreams. How haggard and wild he looks by that dim candle-light.    Once more he throws himself upon his bed, and, after a while, is again  asleep, if such unconsciousness can be called sleep. Again he tosses,  and turns, and sighs like one in a nightmare until at last, towards the  breaking of day, the quick, startling breathing ceases, and subsides  into a regular and equal respiration, and he lies still. Nature  overcomes all else, and he now sleeps, indeed, but not until he has  passed through a fearful purgatory of dreams, all too real, too  trying.--His brother, with soon the prospect of a disgraceful death on  the gallows, had not suffered thus. No, he was repentant for the wrong  he had done, and had already resolved to completely reform if the  opportunity were offered to him; but Robert Bramble was outraging the  laws of nature and of God.          CHAPTER XV.    THE ESCAPE.      CHARLES BRAMBLE found himself playing a dangerous part. It was true that  Leonard Hust had freed his hands from those shackles that had confined  them so long, and had pointed out to him the way to retreat and escape;  but he must run the gauntlet of dangers in order to do so. This,  however, he was prepared to do; as to fear, it was a sensation he knew  not; but prudence was much more requisite in this instance than any  especial degree of courage. As is always the case on board a man-of-war,  especially when lying in port, where the escape to the shore is easy,  sentinels were placed at stem, stern and waist of the English ship, at  all hours, pacing their allotted round of the deck, and keeping watchful  guard over every avenue of exit from the vessel.    The only possible plan of escape that suggested itself to Charles  Bramble, under the circumstances, "]]]
