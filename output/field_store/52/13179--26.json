Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"had been  called a few minutes past midnight; and as the men were going on deck to  muster, the ship gave a terrible lurch to starboard, soon, however,  righting herself on that occasion. Robert Hirst, a seaman, who afterwards  gave some valuable testimony, was on the forecastle. There was a very  strong wind, and the ship was then only carrying her three top-sails,  double reefs in each, and the foretop-mast stay-sail. The yards were  braced sharp up, and the ship had little way upon her.(44) As the watch  was mustered, he heard Captain Burgoyne give the order, \"Let go the  foretop-sail halyards!\" followed by, \"Let go fore and maintop-sail  sheets!\" By the time the men got to the top-sail sheets the ship was  heeling over to starboard so much that others were being washed off the  deck, the ship lying down on her side, as she was gradually turning over  and trembling through her whole frame with every blow which the short,  jumping, vicious seas, now white with the squall, gave her.(45) The roar  of the steam from her boilers was terrific, \"outscreaming the noise of the  storm,\" but not drowning the shrieks of the poor engineers and stokers  which were heard by some of the survivors. The horrors of their situation  can be imagined. The sea, breaking down the funnel, would soon, no doubt,  extinguish the furnaces, but not until some of their contents had been  dashed into the engine-room, with oceans of scalding water; the boilers  themselves may, likely enough, have given way and burst also. Mercifully,  it was not for long. Hirst, with two other men, rushed to the  weather-forecastle netting and jumped overboard. It was hardly more than a  few moments before they found themselves washed on to the bilge of the  ship's bottom, for in that brief space of time the ship had turned  completely over, and almost immediately went down. Hirst and his  companions went down with the ship, but the next feeling of consciousness  by the former was coming into contact with a floating spar, to which he  tied himself with his black silk handkerchief. He was soon, however,  washed from the spar, but got hold of the stern of the second launch,  which was covered with canvas, and floating as it was stowed on board the  ship. Other men were there, on the top of the canvas covering. Immediately  after, they fell in with the steam-lifeboat pinnace, bottom-up, with  Captain Burgoyne and several men clinging to it. Four men, of whom Mr.  May,(46) the gunner, was one, jumped from off the bottom of the  steam-pinnace to the launch. One account says that Captain Burgoyne  incited them, by calling out, \"Jump, men, jump!\" but did not do it  himself. The canvas was immediately cut away, and with the oars free, they  attempted to pull up to the steam-pinnace to rescue the captain and others  remaining there. This they found impossible to accomplish. As soon as they  endeavoured to get the boat's head up to the sea to row her to windward to  where the capsized boat was floating, their boat was swamped almost level  to her thwarts, and two of the men were washed clean out of her. The pump  was set going, and the boat bailed out with their caps, &c., as far as  possible. They then made a second attempt to row the boat against the sea,  which was as unsuccessful as before. Meantime, poor Burgoyne was still  clinging to the pinnace, in \"a storm of broken waters.\" When the launch  was swept towards him once, one of the men on board offered to throw him  an oar, which he declined, saying, nobly, \"For God's sake, men, keep your  oars: you will want them.\" This piece of self-abnegation probably cost him  his life, for he went down shortly after, following \"the six hundred\" of  his devoted crew into \"the valley of death.\" The launch was beaten hither  and thither; and a quarter of an hour after the _Captain_ had capsized,  sighted the lights of one of their own ships, which was driven by in the  gale, its officers knowing nothing of the fate of these unfortunates, or  their still more hapless companions. Mr. May, the gunner, took charge of  the launch, and at daybreak they sighted Cape Finisterre, inside which  they landed after twelve hours' hard work at the oars.               [Illustration: THE \"CAPTAIN\" IN THE BAY OF BISCAY.]    One man, when he found the vessel capsizing, crawled over the  weather-netting on the port side, and performed an almost incredible feat.  It is well told in his own laconic style:--\"Felt ship heel over, and felt  she would not right. Made for weather-hammock netting. She was then on her  beam-ends. Got along her bottom by degrees, as she kept turning over,  until I was where her keel would have been if she had one. The seas then  washed me off. I saw a piece of wood about twenty yards off, and swam to  it.\" In other words, he got over her side, and walked _up_ to the bottom!  While in the water, two poor drowning wretches caught hold of him, and  literally tore off the legs of his trousers. He could not help them, and  they sank for the last time.    Many and varied were the explanations given of the causes of this  disaster. There had evidently been some uneasiness in regard to her  stability in the water at one time, but she had sailed so well on previous  trips, in the same stormy waters, that confidence had been restored in  her. The belief, afterwards, among many authorities, was that she ought  not to have carried sail at all.(47) This was the primary cause of the  disaster, no doubt; and then, in all probability, when the force of the  wind had heeled her over, a heavy sea struck her and completely capsized  her--the water on and over her depressed side assisting by weighting her  downwards. The side of the hurricane-deck acted, when the vessel was  heeled over, as one vast sail, and, no doubt, had much to do with putting  her on her beam-ends. The general impression of the survivors appeared to  be that, with the ship heeling over, the pressure of a strong wind upon  the under part of the hurricane-deck had a greater effect or leverage upon  the hull, than the pressure of the wind on her top-sails. They were also  nearly unanimous in their opinion that when the _Captain's_ starboard side  was well down in the water, with the weight of water on the turret-deck,  and the pressure of the wind blowing from the port hand on the under  surface of the hurricane-deck, and thus pushing the ship right over, she  had no chance of righting herself again.    It is to be remarked that long after the _Captain_ had sunk, the admiral  of the squadron thought that he saw her, although it was very evident  afterwards that it must have been some other vessel. In his despatch to  the Admiralty,(48) which very plainly indicated that he had some anxiety  in regard to her stability in bad weather, he described her appearance and  behaviour up till 1.30 a.m.--more than an hour after her final exit to the  depths below. In the days of superstitious belief, so common among  sailors, a thrilling story of her image haunting the spot would surely  have been built on this foundation.    In the old fighting-days of the Royal Navy, when success followed success,  and prize after prize rewarded the daring and enterprise of its  commanders, they did not think very much of the loss of a vessel more or  less, but took the lesser evils with the greater goods. The seamanship was  wonderful, but it was very often utterly reckless. A captain trained in  the school of Nelson and Cochrane would stop at nothing. The country,  accustomed to great naval battles, enriched by the spoils of the enemy--who  furnished some of the finest vessels in our fleet--was not much affected by  the loss of a ship, and the Admiralty was inclined to deal leniently with  a spirited commander who had met with an accident. But then an accident in  those days did not mean the loss of half a million pounds or so. The cost  of a large ironclad of to-day would have built a small wooden fleet of  those days.    The loss of the _Captain_ irresistibly brings to memory another great loss  to the Royal Navy, which occurred nearly ninety years before, and by which  900 lives were in a moment swept into eternity. It proved too plainly that  \"wooden walls\" might capsize as readily as the \"crankiest\" ironclad. The  reader will immediately guess that we refer to the loss of the _Royal  George_, which took place at Spithead, on the 28th of August, 1782, in  calm weather, but still under circumstances which, to a very great extent,  explain how the _Captain_--at the best, a vessel of doubtful  stability--capsized in the stormy waters of Biscay. The _Royal George_ was,  at the time, the oldest first-rate in the service, having been put into  commission in 1755. She carried 108 guns, and was considered a staunch  ship, and a good sailer. Anson, Boscawen, Rodney, Howe, and Hawke had all  repeatedly commanded in her.    From what small causes may great and lamentable disasters arise! \"During  the washing of her decks, on the 28th, the carpenter discovered that the  pipe which admitted the water to cleanse and sweeten the ship, and which  was about three feet under the water, was out of repair--that it was  necessary to replace it with a new one, and to heel her on one side for  that purpose.\" The guns on the port side of the ship were run out of the  port-holes as far as they would go, and those from the starboard side were  drawn in and secured amidships. This brought her porthole-sills on the  lower side nearly even with the water. \"At about 9 o'clock a.m., or rather  before,\" stated one of the survivors,(49) \"we had just finished our  breakfast, and the last lighter, with rum on board, had come alongside;  this vessel was a sloop of about fifty tons, and belonged to three  brothers, who used her to carry things on board the men-of-war. She was  lashed to the larboard side of the _Royal George_, and we were piped to  clear the lighter and get the rum out of her, and stow it in the hold...."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39372"],[0,"The Recent Mammals of Tamaulipas, México (#19)"],[1,"females, 36.9; Sierra de  Tamaulipas, 12 males, 47.3, 20 females, 40.7; Sierra Madre Oriental,  eight males, 45.5, nine females, 37.0 grams.

Washington, 26:191, October 23, type from Ruidoso       Creek, 6 mi. below Ruidoso, Lincoln Co., New Mexico.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Probably in the Rio Grande       drainage.    The beaver has been reported in Tamaulipas only from Matamoros (Baird,  1858:355--three specimens) and from 12 miles below, south of, Matamoros  (V. Bailey, 1905:124). In Tamaulipas the beaver may occur only in the  Rio Grande drainage.      =Oryzomys palustris=    Marsh Rice Rat    Previous to this report only one subspecies of _Oryzomys palustris_ had  been recorded from Tamaulipas. Careful examination of the available  material from the state shows that _O. p. aquaticus_ occurs in the east  and _O. p. peragrus_ lives in the southwestern part of the state.    In general, specimens examined were trapped in dense brush alongside  waterholes as at Altamira, or around cornfields as at the place 36  kilometers north and 10 kilometers west of Ciudad Victoria, where the  bushes were mesquite and other kinds of Acacias. There the ground was  covered by cat claw, and no grass was seen near the traps in which _O.  palustris_ was caught. In the Sierra de Tamaulipas a specimen was  caught among rocks and bushes. Ingles (1959:395) reported that his  specimens were trapped alive in dense brush and \"tules.\"    A female taken at Jaumave on July 25 had 5 embryos, each 20 mm. in  crown-rump length.      =Oryzomys palustris aquaticus= J.

Weights of two males were 80 and 82, and of a female 66 grams.    _Oryzomys palustris aquaticus_ differs from _O. p. peragrus_ in having  a rich cinnamon, reddish color and the interorbital region constricted  to less than 14.7 per cent of the greatest length of the skull. _O. p.  peragrus_ is ochraceous and grayish. The least width of its  interorbital region is more than 14.5 per cent of the greatest length  of the skull. Individuals studied from the Sierra de Tamaulipas are  typical _aquaticus_. Of those from Altamira, one has the color as in  _aquaticus_, but the color of the other two resembles that of  _peragrus_; nevertheless, all of the mentioned specimens are here  assigned to _aquaticus_.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 4: Sierra de       Tamaulipas, 10 mi.

Two males from Jaumave weighed 62 and 65 and one pregnant female  weighed 67 grams.    Most records of _O. p. peragrus_ are from places along the Sierra Madre  Oriental, but Lawrence (1947:103) recorded a specimen from the Rio  Corona, which is east of, but not far from the mentioned Sierra. Baker  (1951:215) reported two specimens from two different localities labeled  with reference to Ciudad Victoria (same specimens reported here) as _O.  p. aquaticus_, but pointed out that they tended \"toward the darker _O.  c. peragrus_.\" Examination of more material and taking into  consideration the relation between the interorbital constriction and  the greatest length of skull, cause me here to refer those specimens to  _peragrus_.    Hooper (1953:8) reported three young specimens from Rancho Pano Ayuctle  as of the subspecies _aquaticus_, but study of two adults from the same  locality reveals that this locality should be included within the  geographic range of _peragrus_.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 9: 36 km. N,       10 km. W Cd. Victoria, 1; Jaumave, 2400 ft., 5; Rancho Pano       Ayuctle, 25 mi. N, 3 km. W El Mante, 2; 70 km. S Cd.       Victoria (by highway) and 6 km. W of Highway, 1.

Two subspecies are recorded: _O. m. carrorum_ in the north  and _O. m. rostratus_ in the tropical area from Rancho Pano Ayuctle to  Altamira.    Specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were trapped along a stream,  edged with trees, bushes and rocks; at Rancho Pano Ayuctle the animals  were in grass between banana groves. The specimen from 70 kilometers  south of Ciudad Victoria was taken in tall grass near a field of sugar  cane in a line of traps that yielded also _Peromyscus leucopus_,  _Sigmodon hispidus_, _Liomys irroratus_, and _Oryzomys fulvescens_.  Hooper (1953:8) and Ingles (1959:395) reported _O. melanotis_ as caught  at the edges of cane fields.      =Oryzomys melanotis carrorum= Lawrence         1947. _Oryzomys rostratus carrorum_ Lawrence, Proc. New       England Zool. Club, 24:101, May 29, type from Rancho Santa       Ana, about 8 mi. SW Padilla, Rio Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas.         1959. _Oryzomys melanotis carrorum_, Hall and Kelson, The       Mammals of North America, 2:560, March 21.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Southeast part of state;       known only from the type locality and the Sierra de       Tamaulipas.    The original description of this subspecies was based on three  specimens collected at Rancho Santa Ana. Specimens examined from the  Sierra de Tamaulipas extended the known range 45 miles southeast of the  type locality, and also extend the previously known altitudinal range  of 300-350 feet elevation to 1200 feet.    Specimens examined correspond in color and measurements to those  recorded by Lawrence (1947:102-103). Of 12 specimens studied, the  tympanic bullae of six touch the surface of the table when the skull  rests on the tips of the incisors and the occipital condyles. In the  other six the bullae are 0.3 to 1.3 mm. above the table top. The  mesopterygoid space in the specimens examined are broad and U-shaped  and not V-shaped as in the three specimens examined by Lawrence (_op.  cit._). Weight of six males was 52.5 (48-63) and of four females 44.7  (40-49) grams.         _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of six       males are as follows: 255.3 (240-269); 135.7 (120-147);       135.7 (120-147); 30.4 (30-31); 21 (20-22); greatest length       of skull, 31.6 (30.9-32.5); zygomatic breadth, 15.3       (14.7-16.1); interorbital constriction, 4.8 (4.5-5.1);       breadth of skull, 31.6 (30.9-32.5); length of nasals, 12.9       (12.4-13.4); length of anterior palatine foramina, 5.5       (5.2-5.7); length of palatal bridge, 6.1 (5.8-6.4); length       of maxillary tooth-row, 4.0 (3.9-4.1). The females average       slightly smaller.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 12 from Sierra       de Tamaulipas, 10 mi. W, 2 mi. S Piedra, 1200 ft.
