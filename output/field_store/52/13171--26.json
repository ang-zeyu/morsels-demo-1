Moving now from India westwards, we find on one side the Iranian, and  on the other the Turanian traditions. We cannot pass into Europe  without at least indicating the general character of each.    In the Persian cosmogony, the bull (_gaus aevo dato_) is one of the  first of created existences, being as old as the elements. It is,  moreover, well known how much importance was ascribed to the bull  among the Persians in the mysteries of the solar god Mithra, who is  represented as a beautiful youth, holding the horns of a bull in his  left hand, and having the knife of sacrifice in his right. Mithra  sacrificing the bull is just the solar hero sacrificing himself in the  evening. Indeed, in the Persian tradition, Mithra, like the Hindoo  Yamas, holds the office of god of the dead, and as such, like Yamas,  is of a monstrous aspect, and is found in the _Yacna_ represented with  a thousand ears and ten thousand eyes.    As in India, so in Persia, the urine of the cow is used in ceremonies of  purification, during which it is drunk.[267] We have already seen in the  story of Utankas how the excrement of the bull, upon which Utankas fed,  was ambrosia itself; and, indeed, all is beneficial which is given by  the cow of abundance (the moon, the cloud, and the aurora), and by the  divine bull (the moon and the sun). The mythical belief was natural,  however disgusting when we insist on literal interpretation.

Kherson was taken March 21.  On March 27, the semi-official Russian news agency announced that the  Soviet and Ukrainian troops, assisted by naval forces, recaptured  Odessa. According to an earlier report, Kherson, Nikolayev, and Znamenka  were also recaptured by Red Guards and armed civilians. The retaking of  Odessa was officially denied by Vienna, and the city is apparently in  the hands of the Teutons at this writing (April 18). They are reported  to have seized large stores of war materials at Odessa, and 2,500 ships  at Nikolayev, which is a port on the Black Sea, with vast docks for  building warships. The Austro-Germans also took Poltava, situated midway  between the Dnieper and Donetz, and set it on fire. The capture of  Poltava was followed (April 8) by that of Yekaterinoslav and Kharkov,  the former seat of the Bolshevist Rada.    On April 11 the invaders occupied the small city of Lgov, 130 miles  northwest of Kharkov, and an ultimatum was sent to the City of Kursk,  demanding its surrender. Both towns are situated in the province of  Kursk, which lies beyond the Russo-Ukrainian border as defined by the  Central Powers.    The march of the Teutons, coupled with their requisitions of food  products, seemed to arouse a good deal of dissatisfaction among the  peasants and workmen in the Ukraine. It is reported that the Rada, which  had invited the Germans, requested them to stop the advance of their  troops, but their request was not heeded. The behavior of the Teutons in  Kiev led to a clash between the Ukrainian authorities and the German  commandant. The demand of the Austro-Germans that the Ukraine should  furnish them 85 per cent. of its grain and all its sugar except that  needed for local consumption was particularly resented. On April 7 the  Bolshevist Foreign Minister Chicherin signified to the German  Government his willingness to open peace negotiations with the Ukraine.  According to some advices the Rada wished to form a federated alliance  with the Russian Republic.      IN THE CAUCASUS    Article 4 of the Russo-German treaty provides for the evacuation by the  Russian troops of the districts of Erivan, Kars, and Batum, (in the  Caucasus,) and the reorganization of these districts in agreement with  Turkey. The Transcaucasion Constituent Assembly, meeting in Tiflis,  refused to recognize the peace with the Central Powers and pronounced  itself in favor of a war against them. On March 29 it was reported that  the local Diet declared the independence of the Caucasus and approved  the project of a separate peace with Turkey. But when, several days  later, the Turks began the military occupation of the Caucasian  districts mentioned in the Brest-Litovsk treaty, the Armenians and  Georgians rose against the invaders. On April 4 the Armenians were said  to have recaptured Erzerum, in Turkish Armenia, which Russia evacuated  after the conclusion of peace. Before the Caucasian uprising Turkey  officially announced its intention to send troops to restore order in  the Crimea. It was reported that massacres of Armenians were resumed by  the Turks and that many thousand women and children had been butchered.    On April 14 the Russian Government forwarded to Germany a protest of the  Armenian National Council, addressed to the German Ministry of Foreign  Affairs and the President of the Reichstag. The document reads in part:        Following upon the withdrawal of the Russian troops Turkish      troops already have invaded the undefended country and are not      only killing every Turkish Armenian, but also every Russian in      Armenia.        In spite of the terms of the peace treaty, which recognizes the      right of self-determination for these Caucasian regions, the      Turkish Army is advancing toward Kars and Ardahan, destroying      the country and killing the Christian population. The      responsibility for the future destiny of the Armenians lies      entirely with Germany because it was Germany's insistence that      resulted in the withdrawal of the Russian troops from the      Armenian regions, and at the moment it rests with Germany to      prevent the habitual excesses of the Turkish troops, increased      by revengefulness and anger.      INTERNAL SITUATION    The internal situation in Russia proper remains uncertain, nor have any  definite changes taken place in the mood of the people or in the  Governmental policies of the Bolsheviki. It is charged that the  Bolshevist Government suppressed the full text of the Brest-Litovsk  Treaty. On April 10 the Commissioner of Commerce of the Bolsheviki  announced that under the terms of the peace treaty Russia had suffered  the following losses:        Seven hundred and eighty thousand square kilometers (301,000      square miles) of territory.        Fifty-six million inhabitants, constituting 32 per cent, of the      entire population of the country.        One-third of Russia's total mileage of railways, amounting to      21,530 kilometers, (13,350 miles.)        Seventy-three per cent. of the total iron production.        Eighty-nine per cent. of the total coal production.        Two hundred and sixty-eight sugar refineries, 918 textile      factories, 574 breweries, 133 tobacco factories, 1,685      distilleries, 244 chemical factories, 615 paper mills, 1,073      machine factories.        These territories, which now become German, formerly brought in      annual revenue amounting to 845,238 rubles, and had 1,800      savings banks.    The alarming sweep of the Teutonic invasion, together with the growing  realization of what the Brest-Litovsk agreement really means to Russia,  seemed finally to arouse some spirit of resistance in the Russian  masses. Patriarch Tikhon declared that the Russian Church could not  recognize a peace dismembering the country and subjecting it to a  foreign power. Since the ratification the spokesmen of the Bolshevist  Government have not ceased talking of organizing a large army for a new  war. The prevalent Bolshevist opinion is that the new revolutionary army  should be used, in the words of the semi-official Bolshevist organ  Pravda, \"not to strengthen, as the imperialists calculate, this or that  bourgeois front, but to turn the front of the world war into a front of  the workers' and soldiers' revolution.\"    [Illustration: The United States Congress in wartime, including nearly  all the members of the House, on the steps of the Capitol  ((C) _Harris & Ewing_)]    [Illustration: An American first aid station in the trenches in France  ((C) _Committee on Public Information_)]      TALK OF NEW ARMY    In March it was reported that four of the People's Commissaries had gone  south to organize troops for guerrilla warfare. This idea, however, was  soon abandoned. Trotzky insisted upon the necessity of having a strictly  disciplined army of 300,000 to 750,000 men, under regular officers. \"We  cannot,\" he said, \"preserve the illusion that European capital will  patiently suffer the fact that in Russia the power is in the hands of  the working class. * * * We are surrounded by enemies on all sides. If  it were proposed to France to return Alsace, the French Bourse would  sell Russia tomorrow.\" On April 2 M. Podvoisky, Assistant Commissary of  War, stated that Russia would form an army of 1,500,000 men, and that  the Red Army of Volunteers was steadily growing. The army organization  has been changed with a view to limiting the application of the elective  principle. According to some reports the Bolsheviki are hoping to have  an army of 500,000 by the Fall. Some of the leaders went so far as to  advocate compulsory military service. On April 10 Leon Trotzky was  appointed joint Minister of War and Marine.    On the previous day the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets  unanimously passed a resolution ruling that henceforth Russia's national  flag would be a red banner bearing the inscription: \"_Rossiyskaya,  Sotzialisticheskaya Federativnaya Sovetskaya Respublika_,\" (Russian  Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.) Proposing the measure, the  Chairman said: \"The Russian flag will have to wave over the embassies in  Berlin and Vienna and we cannot have the old tricolor, so I think it  most proper to adopt the red flag under which we fought and gained  victory.\"      BESSARABIA AND RUMANIA    An important event has taken place in the southwestern corner of the  former Russian Empire, in the rich province of Bessarabia, where  separatist tendencies have recently made themselves strongly felt. A  Berlin dispatch, dated April 11, announced that the Bessarabian Diet  had voted, 86 against 5, that Bessarabia should join the Kingdom of  Rumania. Thereupon, the Ukrainian Premier filed a protest in Russia  against this act, stating that the Ukraine must have her say in the  settlement of Bessarabia's fate in view of the fact that this province  has a large Ukrainian population and that the Ukraine is controlling an  important region on the Black Sea adjacent to Bessarabia.    The Council of the People's Commissaries was notified on April 9 that  the Province of Kazan, situated in the east of European Russia and  having a population of 2,000,000, had been proclaimed an independent  republic by the Congress of Peasants of that region.      RUSSIA AND THE ALLIES    The Entente did not acknowledge the Russo-German peace. In a statement  issued March 18 through the British Foreign Office the Governments of  Great Britain, France, and Italy voiced their protest against \"the  political crimes which, under the name of a German peace, have been  committed against the Russian people.\" Ambassador David R. Francis, when  asked whether he would leave Russia in consequence of the ratification  of the peace treaty, gave the following reply:        I shall not leave Russia until compelled by"]]]
