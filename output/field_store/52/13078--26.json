Now, this is what I want to ask  you about--to wit, how you get people to work when there is no reward of  labour, and especially how you get them to work strenuously?\"    \"No reward of labour?\" said Hammond, gravely.  \"The reward of labour is  _life_.  Is that not enough?\"    \"But no reward for especially good work,\" quoth I.    \"Plenty of reward,\" said he--\"the reward of creation.  The wages which  God gets, as people might have said time agone.  If you are going to ask  to be paid for the pleasure of creation, which is what excellence in work  means, the next thing we shall hear of will be a bill sent in for the  begetting of children.\"    \"Well, but,\" said I, \"the man of the nineteenth century would say there  is a natural desire towards the procreation of children, and a natural  desire not to work.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said he, \"I know the ancient platitude,--wholly untrue;  indeed, to us quite meaningless.  Fourier, whom all men laughed at,  understood the matter better.\"    \"Why is it meaningless to you?\" said I.    He said: \"Because it implies that all work is suffering, and we are so  far from thinking that, that, as you may have noticed, whereas we are not  short of wealth, there is a kind of fear growing up amongst us that we  shall one day be short of work.  It is a pleasure which we are afraid of  losing, not a pain.\"    \"Yes,\" said I, \"I have noticed that, and I was going to ask you about  that also.  But in the meantime, what do you positively mean to assert  about the pleasurableness of work amongst you?\"    \"This, that _all_ work is now pleasurable; either because of the hope of  gain in honour and wealth with which the work is done, which causes  pleasurable excitement, even when the actual work is not pleasant; or  else because it has grown into a pleasurable _habit_, as in the case with  what you may call mechanical work; and lastly (and most of our work is of  this kind) because there is conscious sensuous pleasure in the work  itself; it is done, that is, by artists.\"    \"I see,\" said I.  \"Can you now tell me how you have come to this happy  condition?  For, to speak plainly, this change from the conditions of the  older world seems to me far greater and more important than all the other  changes you have told me about as to crime, politics, property,  marriage.\"    \"You are right there,\" said he.  \"Indeed, you may say rather that it is  this change which makes all the others possible.  What is the object of  Revolution?  Surely to make people happy.  Revolution having brought its  foredoomed change about, how can you prevent the counter-revolution from  setting in except by making people happy?  What! shall we expect peace  and stability from unhappiness?  The gathering of grapes from thorns and  figs from thistles is a reasonable expectation compared with that!  And  happiness without happy daily work is impossible.\"    \"Most obviously true,\" said I: for I thought the old boy was preaching a  little.  \"But answer my question, as to how you gained this happiness.\"    \"Briefly,\" said he, \"by the absence of artificial coercion, and the  freedom for every man to do what he can do best, joined to the knowledge  of what productions of labour we really wanted.  I must admit that this  knowledge we reached slowly and painfully.\"    \"Go on,\" said I, \"give me more detail; explain more fully.  For this  subject interests me intensely.\"    \"Yes, I will,\" said he; \"but in order to do so I must weary you by  talking a little about the past.  Contrast is necessary for this  explanation.  Do you mind?\"    \"No, no,\" said I.    Said he, settling himself in his chair again for a long talk: \"It is  clear from all that we hear and read, that in the last age of  civilisation men had got into a vicious circle in the matter of  production of wares.  They had reached a wonderful facility of  production, and in order to make the most of that facility they had  gradually created (or allowed to grow, rather) a most elaborate system of  buying and selling, which has been called the World-Market; and that  World-Market, once set a-going, forced them to go on making more and more  of these wares, whether they needed them or not.  So that while (of  course) they could not free themselves from the toil of making real  necessaries, they created in a never-ending series sham or artificial  necessaries, which became, under the iron rule of the aforesaid World-  Market, of equal importance to them with the real necessaries which  supported life.  By all this they burdened themselves with a prodigious  mass of work merely for the sake of keeping their wretched system going.\"    \"Yes--and then?\" said I.    \"Why, then, since they had forced themselves to stagger along under this  horrible burden of unnecessary production, it became impossible for them  to look upon labour and its results from any other point of view than  one--to wit, the ceaseless endeavour to expend the least possible amount  of labour on any article made, and yet at the same time to make as many  articles as possible.  To this 'cheapening of production', as it was  called, everything was sacrificed: the happiness of the workman at his  work, nay, his most elementary comfort and bare health, his food, his  clothes, his dwelling, his leisure, his amusement, his education--his  life, in short--did not weigh a grain of sand in the balance against this  dire necessity of 'cheap production' of things, a great part of which  were not worth producing at all.  Nay, we are told, and we must believe  it, so overwhelming is the evidence, though many of our people scarcely  _can_ believe it, that even rich and powerful men, the masters of the  poor devils aforesaid, submitted to live amidst sights and sounds and  smells which it is in the very nature of man to abhor and flee from, in  order that their riches might bolster up this supreme folly.  The whole  community, in fact, was cast into the jaws of this ravening monster, 'the  cheap production' forced upon it by the World-Market.\"    \"Dear me!\" said I.  \"But what happened?  Did not their cleverness and  facility in production master this chaos of misery at last?  Couldn't  they catch up with the World-Market, and then set to work to devise means  for relieving themselves from this fearful task of extra labour?\"    He smiled bitterly.  \"Did they even try to?\" said he.  \"I am not sure.  You know that according to the old saw the beetle gets used to living in  dung; and these people, whether they found the dung sweet or not,  certainly lived in it.\"    His estimate of the life of the nineteenth century made me catch my  breath a little; and I said feebly, \"But the labour-saving machines?\"    \"Heyday!\" quoth he.  \"What's that you are saying? the labour-saving  machines?  Yes, they were made to 'save labour' (or, to speak more  plainly, the lives of men) on one piece of work in order that it might be  expended--I will say wasted--on another, probably useless, piece of work.  Friend, all their devices for cheapening labour simply resulted in  increasing the burden of labour.  The appetite of the World-Market grew  with what it fed on: the countries within the ring of 'civilisation'  (that is, organised misery) were glutted with the abortions of the  market, and force and fraud were used unsparingly to 'open up' countries  _outside_ that pale.  This process of 'opening up' is a strange one to  those who have read the professions of the men of that period and do not  understand their practice; and perhaps shows us at its worst the great  vice of the nineteenth century, the use of hypocrisy and cant to evade  the responsibility of vicarious ferocity.  When the civilised  World-Market coveted a country not yet in its clutches, some transparent  pretext was found--the suppression of a slavery different from and not so  cruel as that of commerce; the pushing of a religion no longer believed  in by its promoters; the 'rescue' of some desperado or homicidal madman  whose misdeeds had got him into trouble amongst the natives of the  'barbarous' country--any stick, in short, which would beat the dog at  all.  Then some bold, unprincipled, ignorant adventurer was found (no  difficult task in the days of competition), and he was bribed to 'create  a market' by breaking up whatever traditional society there might be in  the doomed country, and by destroying whatever leisure or pleasure he  found there.  He forced wares on the natives which they did not want, and  took their natural products in 'exchange,' as this form of robbery was  called, and thereby he 'created new wants,' to supply which (that is, to  be allowed to live by their new masters) the hapless, helpless people had  to sell themselves into the slavery of hopeless toil so that they might  have something wherewith to purchase the nullities of 'civilisation.'    \"Ah,\" said the old man, pointing to the Museum, \"I have read books and  papers in there, telling strange stories indeed of the dealings of  civilisation (or organised misery) with 'non-civilisation'; from the time  when the British Government deliberately sent blankets infected with  small-pox as choice gifts to inconvenient tribes of Red-skins, to the  time when Africa was infested by a man named Stanley, who--\"    \"Excuse me,\" said I, \"but as you know, time presses; and I want to keep  our question on the straightest line possible; and I want at once to ask  this about these wares made for the World-Market--how about their  quality; these people who were so clever about making goods, I suppose  they made them well?\"    \"Quality!\" said the old man crustily, for he was rather peevish at being  cut short in his story; \"how could they possibly attend to such trifles  as the quality of the wares they sold?  The best of them were of a lowish  average, the worst were transparent make-shifts for the things asked for,  which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32677"],[0,"The Invention of the Sewing Machine (#19)"],[1,"amton, N.Y.
