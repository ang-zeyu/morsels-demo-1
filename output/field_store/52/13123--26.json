[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#19)"],[1,"forth just previously to the  gathering of Israel? Answer: They were, according to Ezekiel,  thirty-seventh chapter, where God commanded him to \"Take one stick,  and write upon it For Judah, and the children of Israel his  companions; then take another stick, and write upon it For Joseph, the  stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions; and  join them one to another, into one stick, and they shall become one in  thine hand. And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,  saying, Wilt not thou show us what thou meanest by these? say unto  them, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will take the stick of  Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his  fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and  make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand; and the  sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will take the  children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and  will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land;  and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of  Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no  more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any  more at all.\"    Now, nothing can be more plain than the above prophecy; there are  presented two writings, the one to Ephraim, the other to Judah; that  of Ephraim is to be brought forth by the Lord, and put with that of  Judah, and they are to become one in their testimony, and grow  together in this manner, in order to bring about the gathering of  Israel. The eighty-fifth Psalm is very plain on the subject: speaking  of the restoration of Israel to their own land, it says, \"Mercy and  Truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each  other. _Truth shall spring out of the earth:_ and Righteousness shall  look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good;  and our land shall yield her increase. Righteousness shall go before  Him, and shall set us in the way of His steps.\" Now the Savior, while  praying for His disciples, said: \"Sanctify them through Thy  _truth_--Thy _word_ is _truth_.\" From these passages we learn, that  His word is to spring out of the earth, while Righteousness looks down  from heaven. And the next thing that follows is, that Israel are set  in the way of His steps, and partaking of the fruit of their own land.  Jeremiah, xxxiii, 6, speaking of the final return from captivity of  both Judah and Israel, says: \"I will reveal unto them the abundance of  peace and truth.\" And Isaiah, speaking of the everlasting covenant,  which should gather them, makes this extraordinary and very remarkable  expression: \"Their seed shall be known amongst the Gentiles, and their  offspring among the people.\" Now, reader, let me ask, can any one tell  whether the Indians of America are of Israel, unless by revelation  from God? Therefore this was a hidden mystery, which it was necessary  to reveal in time for their gathering.    So much, then, we have produced from the Scriptures, in proof of a  work, like the book of Mormon, making its appearance in these days; to  say nothing of Isaiah, xxix. But says one, \"What is the use of the  Book of Mormon, even if it be true?\" I answer: First, it brings to  light an important history, before unknown to man. Second, it reveals  the origin of the American Indians, which was before a mystery. Third,  it contains important prophecies, yet to be fulfilled, which  immediately concern the present generation. Fourth, it contains much  plainness in regard to points of doctrine, insomuch that all may  understand, and see eye to eye, if they take pains to read it.    \"But what are its proofs, as to chosen witnesses who testify to its  translation by inspiration?\" For this testimony, I refer the reader to  the testimony of the witnesses in the first page of the Book of  Mormon; he will there find as positive testimony as has ever been  found in the other Scriptures concerning any truth which God ever  revealed. Men there testify, not only that they have seen and handled  the plates, but that an angel of God came down from heaven, and  presented the plates before them, while the glory of God shone round  about them, and the voice of God spoke from heaven, and told them that  these things were true, and had been translated by the gift and power  of God, and commanded them to bear record of the same to all people.    Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers! He has visited His people, and  the dayspring from on high has dawned upon our benighted world once  more; for no sooner had the Book been translated, and men begun to  bear record of the same, than the Angel of the Lord came down from  heaven again, and commissioned men to preach the Gospel to every  creature, and to baptize with water for the remission of sins. No  sooner did the people begin to believe their testimony, and be  baptized, than the Holy Ghost fell upon them, through the laying on of  hands in the name of Jesus; and the heavens were opened: and while  some had the ministering of angels, others began to speak in other  tongues, and prophesy. From that time forth, many of them were healed  by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus; and thus mightily grew  the word of God, and prevailed. And thus, thousands have been raised  up to testify that they do know for themselves, and are not dependent  on the testimony of any man, for the truth of these things, for these  signs follow them that believe. And when a man believes the truth,  through the testimony of God's witnesses, and then these signs follow,  not only them, but him also; if he has the ministering of angels, if  he has been healed, or heals others, by the laying on of hands in the  name of Jesus, or if he speaks in other tongues, or prophesies, he  knows it for himself; and thus is fulfilled the saying of Scripture,  \"If any man do my will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be  of God.\" Thus faith comes by hearing, and knowledge by obeying; but  hearing comes by preaching, and preaching comes by sending; as it is  written--\"How shall they preach, except they be sent?\"    But there are many who say--\"Show us a sign, and we will believe.\"  Remember, faith comes not by signs, but signs come by faith. Gifts  were not given to make men believe; but what saith the Scripture?  \"Gifts are for the edifying of the Church.\" If otherwise, why was it  not written--\"Faith comes by miracles,\" instead of \"Faith comes by  hearing?\" I always take it for granted, that a man or woman who comes  demanding a sign in order to make them believe, belongs to a wicked  and adulterous generation, at least, to say no worse; for any person  who will go to Jesus, with a pure heart, desiring and praying in  faith, that he may know the truth concerning these things, the Lord  will reveal it to him, and he shall know, and shall bear testimony,  for by the Spirit of God they shall know truth from error: as it is  written--\"My sheep hear my voice.\" And he that will not come unto  Jesus by faith, shall never know the truth, until, too late, he finds  the harvest is over, and the summer is ended, and his soul not saved.    Thus the religion of Jesus, unlike all other religious systems, bears  its own weight, and brings certainty and knowledge, leaving no room  for imposition. And now I say unto all people, Come unto the Father in  the name of Jesus; doubt not, but be believing, as in days of old, and  ask in faith for whatsoever you stand in need of; ask not that you may  consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness not to be shaken,  that you will yield to no temptation, but that you will keep His  commandments, as fast as He makes them manifest unto you; and if ye do  this, and He reveals to you that He has sent us with a new and  everlasting covenant, and commanded us to preach, and baptize, and  build up His Church as in days of old, then come forward and obey the  truth; but if you do not know, or are not satisfied that He has sent  us, then do not embrace the doctrine we preach. Thus to your own  master you shall stand or fall; and one day you shall know, yea, in  that great day, when every knee shall bow, then shall you know that  God has sent us with the truth, to prune His vineyard for the last  time, with a mighty pruning.    We shall now introduce much circumstantial evidence, from American  antiquities, and from the traditions of the natives, etc.    First, says Mr. Boudinot: \"It is said among their principal or beloved  men, that they have it handed down from their ancestors, that the book  which the white people have, was once theirs: that while they had it  they prospered exceedingly, etc. They also say, that their fathers  were possessed of an extraordinary Divine Spirit, by which they  foretold future events, and controlled the common course of nature;  and this they transmitted to their offspring, on condition of their  obeying the sacred laws; that they did, by these means, bring down  showers of blessings upon their beloved people; but that this power,  for a long time past, had entirely ceased.\" Colonel James Smith, in  his journal, while a prisoner among the natives, says: \"They have a  tradition, that in the beginning of this continent, the angels or  heavenly inhabitants, as they call them, frequently visited the  people, and talked with their forefathers, and gave directions how to  pray.\"    Mr. Boudinot, in his able work, remarks concerning their language:  \"Their language, in its roots, idiom, and particular construction,  appears to have the _whole genius_ of the Hebrew; and what is very  remarkable, and well worthy of serious attention, has most of the  peculiarities of that language.\" There is a tradition related by an  aged Indian, of the Stockbridge tribe, that their fathers were once in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#19)"],[1,"of that capital.    A law of the 23d of August 1794 forbade the use of any other names than  those in the register of births. I wished to conform to this law, which  very foolishly interfered with old habits. My eldest brother was living,  and I therefore designated myself Fauvelet the younger. This annoyed  General Bonaparte. \"Such change of name is absolute nonsense,\" said he.  \"I have known you for twenty years by the name of Bourrienne. Sign as  you still are named, and see what the advocates with their laws will  do.\"    On the 20th of April, as Bonaparte was returning to Italy, he was  obliged to stop on an island of the Tagliamento, while a torrent passed  by, which had been occasioned by a violent storm. A courier appeared on  the right bank of the river. He reached the island. Bonaparte read in  the despatches of the Directory that the armies of the Sambre-et-Meuse  and the Rhine were in motion; that they were preparing to cross the  Rhine, and had commenced hostilities on the very day of the signing  of the preliminaries. This information arrived seven days after the  Directory had written that \"he must not reckon on the co-operation  of the armies of Germany.\" It is impossible to describe the General's  vexation on reading these despatches. He had signed the preliminaries  only because the Government had represented the co-operation of the  armies of the Rhine as impracticable at that moment, and shortly  afterwards he was informed that the co-operation was about to take  place! The agitation of his mind was so great that he for a moment  conceived the idea of crossing to the left bank of the Tagliamento, and  breaking off the negotiations under some pretext or other. He persisted  for some time in this resolution, which, however, Berthier and some  other generals successfully opposed. He exclaimed, \"What a difference  would there have been in the preliminaries, if, indeed, there had been  any!\"    His chagrin, I might almost say his despair, increased when, some days  after his entry into the Venetian States, he received a letter from  Moreau, dated the 23d of April, in which that general informed him that,  having passed the Rhine on the 20th with brilliant success, and taken  four thousand prisoners, it would not be long before he joined him. Who,  in fact, can say what would have happened but for the vacillating  and distrustful policy of the Directory, which always encouraged low  intrigues, and participated in the jealousy excited by the renown of  the young conqueror? Because the Directory dreaded his ambition they  sacrificed the glory of our arms and the honour of the nation; for  it cannot be doubted that, had the passage of the Rhine, so urgently  demanded by Bonaparte, taken place some days sooner, he would have been  able, without incurring any risk, to dictate imperiously the conditions  of peace on the spot; or, if Austria were obstinate, to have gone on to  Vienna and signed it there. Still occupied with this idea, he wrote to  the Directory on the 8th of May: \"Since I have received intelligence of  the passage of the Rhine by Hoche and Moreau, I much regret that it did  not take place fifteen days sooner; or, at least, that Moreau did not  say that he was in a situation to effect it.\" (He had been informed to  the contrary.) What, after this, becomes of the unjust reproach against  Bonaparte of having, through jealousy of Moreau, deprived France of the  advantages which a prolonged campaign would have procured her? Bonaparte  was too devoted to the glory of France to sacrifice it to jealousy of  the glory of any individual.    In traversing the Venetian States to return to Milan, he often spoke  to me of Venice. He always assured me that he was originally entirely  unconnected with the insurrections which had agitated that country; that  common sense would show, as his project was to advance into the basin of  the Danube, he had no interest in having his rear disturbed by revolts,  and his communications interrupted or cut off: \"Such an idea,\" said he,  \"would be absurd, and could never enter into the mind of a man to whom  even his enemies cannot deny a certain degree of tact.\" He acknowledged  that he was not vexed that matters had turned out as they had done,  because he had already taken advantage of these circumstances in the  preliminaries and hoped to profit still more from them in the definitive  peace. \"When I arrive at Milan,\" said he, \"I will occupy myself with  Venice.\" It is therefore quite evident to me that in reality the  General-in-Chief had nothing to do with the Venetian insurrections; that  subsequently he was not displeased with them; and that, later still, he  derived great advantage from them.    We arrived at Milan on the 5th of May, by way of Lawbook, Thrust,  Palma-Nova, Padua, Verona, and Mantua. Bonaparte soon took up his  residence at Montebello, a very fine chateau, three leagues from  Milan, with a view over the rich and magnificent plains of Lombard. At  Montebello commenced the negotiations for the definitive peace which  were terminated at Passeriano. The Marquis de Gallo, the Austrian  plenipotentiary, resided half a league from Montebello.    During his residence at Montebello the General-in-Chief made an  excursion to the Lake of Como and to the Ago Maguire. He visited the  Borromean Islands in succession, and occupied himself on his return with  the organization of the towns of Venice, Genoa, and Milan. He sought for  men and found none. \"Good God,\" said he, \"how rare men are! There  are eighteen millions in Italy, and I have with difficulty found two,  Dandolo and Melzi.\"    He appreciated them properly. Dandolo was one of the men who, in those  revolutionary times, reflected the greatest honour upon Italy. After  being a member of the great council of the Cisalpine Republic, he  exercised the functions of Proveditore-General in Dalmatia. It is only  necessary to mention the name of Dandolo to the Dalmatians to learn from  the grateful inhabitants how just and vigorous his administration was.  The services of Melzi are known. He was Chancellor and Keeper of the  Seals of the Italian monarchy, and was created Duke of Lodi.         --[Francesco, Comte de Melzi d'Eryl (1753-1816), vice President of     the Italian Republic, 1802; Chancellor of the Kingdom of Italy,     1805; Duc de Loth, 1807.]--    In those who have seen the world the truth of Napoleon's reproach  excites little astonishment. In a country which, according to  biographies and newspapers, abounds with extraordinary men, a woman of  much talent--(Madame Roland.)--said, \"What has most surprised me, since  the elevation of my husband has afforded me the opportunity of knowing  many persons, and particularly those employed in important affairs,  is the universal mediocrity which exists. It surpasses all that the  imagination can conceive, and it is observable in all ranks, from  the clerk to the minister. Without this experience I never could have  believed my species to be so contemptible.\"    Who does not remember Oxenstiern's remark to his son, who trembled at  going so young to the congress of Munster: \"Go, my son. You will see by  what sort of men the world is governed.\"            CHAPTER VI.     1797.         Napoleon's correspondence--Release of French prisoners at Olmutz--     Negotiations with Austria--Bonaparte's dissatisfaction--Letter of     complaint from Bonaparte to the Executive Directory--Note respecting     the affairs of Venice and the Club of Clichy, written by Bonaparte     and circulated in the army--Intercepted letter of the Emperor     Francis.    During the time when the preliminaries of Leoben suspended military  operations, Napoleon was not anxious to reply immediately to all  letters. He took a fancy to do, not exactly as Cardinal Dubois did, when  he threw into the fire the letters he had received, saying, \"There! my  correspondents are answered,\" but something of the same kind. To satisfy  himself that people wrote too much, and lost, in trifling and useless  answers, valuable time, he told me to open only the letters which came  by extraordinary couriers, and to leave all the rest for three weeks  in the basket. At the end of that time it was unnecessary to reply to  four-fifths of these communications. Some were themselves answers; some  were acknowledgments of letters received; others contained requests  for favours already granted, but of which intelligence had not been  received. Many were filled with complaints respecting provisions, pay,  or clothing, and orders had been issued upon all these points before  the letters were written. Some generals demanded reinforcements, money,  promotion, etc. By not opening their letters Bonaparte was spared the  unpleasing office of refusing. When the General-in-Chief compared the  very small number of letters which it was necessary to answer with the  large number which time alone had answered, he laughed heartily at his  whimsical idea. Would not this mode of proceeding be preferable to that  of causing letters to be opened by any one who may be employed, and  replying to them by a circular to which it is only necessary to attach a  date?    During the negotiations which followed the treaty of Leoben, the  Directory ordered General Bonaparte to demand the liberty of MM. de La  Fayette, Latour-Marbourg, and Bureau de Puzy, detained at Olmutz  since 1792 as prisoners of state. The General-in-Chief executed  this commission with as much pleasure as zeal, but he often met with  difficulties which appeared to be insurmountable. It has been very  incorrectly stated that these prisoners obtained their liberty by one  of the articles of the preliminaries of Leoben. I wrote a great deal  on this subject to the dictation of General Bonaparte, and I joined him  only on the day after the signature of these preliminaries. It was  not till the end of May of the year 1797 that the liberation of these  captives was"]]]
