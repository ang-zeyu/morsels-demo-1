Information is raw data from any source, data that may  be fragmentary, contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or  wrong. Intelligence is information that has been collected,  integrated, evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished  intelligence is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to  be delivered to the policymaker.      The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence  reports on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable  outcomes. The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is  the foundation on which the other two are constructed; current  intelligence continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and  estimative intelligence revises overall interpretations of country  and issue prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence.  The World Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National  Intelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished  intelligence.      The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities  since the days of George Washington but only since World War II have  they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs  have highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence  since that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies  (JANIS), (2) the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3)The  World Factbook .      During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought  home to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed  and coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers  as Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous  interest. In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines  had to launch amphibious operations against many islands about which  information was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities  resolved that the United States should never again be caught  unprepared.      In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of  Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of  the Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort  should be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April  1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study  Publishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the  Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first  interdepartmental basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of  the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of  strategic basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the  board published 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war  effort, and numerous letters of commendation were received,  including a statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff,  Pacific Ocean Areas, which said, \"JANIS has become the indispensable  reference work for the shore-based planners.\"      The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar  world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author  on national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than  in war. \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human  activities - not just the enemy and his war production.\"      The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and  officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October  1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which  authorized the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a  peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate  NIS country sections could be produced, government agencies had to  develop more comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board  on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the  Interior produced the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.      The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the  structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in  1955 that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable  publication which provides the essential elements of basic  intelligence on all areas of the world. There will always be a  continuing requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The  Factbook was created as an annual summary and update to the  encyclopedic NIS studies. The first classified Factbook was  published in August 1962, and the first unclassified version was  published in June 1971. The NIS program was terminated in 1973  except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer components. The 1975  Factbook was the first to be made available to the public with sales  through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The Factbook was  first made available on the Internet in June 1997. The year 2010  marks the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of the Central  Intelligence Agency and the 67th year of continuous basic  intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and  its two predecessor programs.                The Evolution of The World Factbook      National Basic Intelligence Factbook produced semiannually until  1980. Country entries include sections on Land, Water, People,  Government, Economy, Communications, and Defense Forces.          1981    Publication becomes an annual product and is renamed The World  Factbook. A total of 165 nations are covered on 225 pages.      1983    Appendices (Conversion Factors, International Organizations) first  introduced.      1984    Appendices expanded; now include: A. The United Nations, B. Selected  United Nations Organizations, C. Selected International  Organizations, D. Country Membership in Selected Organizations, E.  Conversion Factors.      1987    A new Geography section replaces the former separate Land and Water  sections. UN Organizations and Selected International Organizations  appendices merged into a new International Organizations appendix.  First multi-color-cover Factbook.      1988    More than 40 new geographic entities added to provide complete world  coverage without overlap or omission. Among the new entities are  Antarctica, oceans (Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), and the  World. The front-of-the-book explanatory introduction expanded and  retitled to Notes, Definitions, and Abbreviations. Two new  Appendices added: Weights and Measures (in place of Conversion  Factors) and a Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names. Factbook  size reaches 300 pages.      1989    Economy section completely revised and now includes an Overview  briefly describing a country's economy. New entries added under  People, Government, and Communications.      1990    The Government section revised and considerably expanded with new  entries.      1991    A new International Organizations and Groups appendix added.  Factbook size reaches 405 pages.      1992    Twenty new successor state entries replace those of the Soviet Union  and Yugoslavia. New countries are respectively: Armenia, Azerbaijan,  Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia,  Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine,  Uzbekistan; and Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia  and Montenegro, Slovenia. Number of nations in the Factbook rises to  188.      1993    Czechoslovakia's split necessitates new Czech Republic and Slovakia  entries. New Eritrea entry added after it secedes from Ethiopia.  Substantial enhancements made to Geography section.      1994    Two new appendices address Selected International Environmental  Agreements. The gross domestic product (GDP) of most developing  countries changed to a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis rather  than an exchange rate basis. Factbook size up to 512 pages.      1995    The GDP of all countries now presented on a PPP basis. New appendix  lists estimates of GDP on an exchange rate basis."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35937"],[0,"Are the Planets Inhabited? (#19)"],[1,"in the same direction. So, not less unmistakably,  do the magnitude and rapidity of the atmospheric movements. The clouds and  storms of our own atmosphere are worked by solar heat; solar heat it is  that draws up the vapours and provides the chief part of the energy  manifested in the speed and strength of the air-current. But solar heat  can only give 1/27th the amount of that energy at the distance of Jupiter,  so that, if they were entirely dependent on solar radiation, the winds of  Jupiter should be very feeble.    Further, the difference of presentment due to the difference of latitude  is a fruitful cause of inequalities of temperature and pressure in the  terrestrial atmosphere. But as a degree of latitude on Jupiter is eleven  times as wide as on the Earth, such inequalities connected with a given  difference in latitude are spread over eleven times the distance that they  would be on the Earth, and are, therefore, so much the less pronounced.  Yet, across a gulf of 400 millions of miles we can clearly discern the  bright zones of Jupiter now narrowing down and constricting the red belts,  now thrust apart by them, and can detect changes taking place in an hour  of time over areas equal to that of a terrestrial hemisphere.    A notable peculiarity of Jupiter is found in the proper motions of its  spots. Many of the white spots are exceedingly swift, giving a rotation  period of 9h. 50m. while the equatorial belt in general gives a period 5m.  longer; so that in 119 rotations (nearly 49 days) a white spot will have  passed entirely round the belt, gaining upon it at a rate of nearly 240  miles an hour.    The most famous of all the markings in Jupiter is the Great Red Spot,  which became conspicuous in 1878, since when the spot itself, or at least  the nest in which it lay, has always been visible. It has been identified  with a great red spot observed by Hooke and Cassini in 1664-6, that  appeared and vanished again eight times between 1665 and 1708. It  therefore has had a history practically as long as our telescopic  knowledge of the planet, and may be looked upon as in some sort a  permanent feature. Yet that it is not in the nature of a portion of a  solid crust is clear. It occupies on Jupiter much the position and  relative area of Australia on the Earth, but whereas Australia of  necessity rotates in one piece with all the other continents, the Great  Red Spot has a rotation period which is neither that of the equatorial  belt, nor of the quickly moving white spots, and is not itself stable. An  \"Australia on the loose\" is impossible, even unthinkable here, but the  Great Red Spot, for all its long duration, is mobile and inconstant, and  is therefore no portion of a solid permanent crust.    The giant planet Jupiter, therefore, offers us an example of what we may  call a \"semi-sun\"; a world still bubbling with tremendous energies of its  own, still pulsing with its own inherent heat, still without a solid  crust; probably without a solid nucleus, liquid or vaporous throughout.  Whatever the future may hold for such an orb, it is clearly no world for  habitation at present. Full of colour, and movement, and change as it is,  it lacks the Earth's \"gloom of iron substance,\" which is necessary, no  less than its veiling by the plant, as a stage for \"the passion and  perishing of mankind.\"    But if Jupiter be a semi-Sun, still a source of heat, perhaps even of  light, can it yield the means of life to its satellites? For Jupiter is  sun-like, not merely in its own condition, but also in that it is the  centre and ruler of a system of its own. We know already of eight  satellites revolving round it.    Of these eight, only four--the four discovered by Galileo, in the first  days of his possession of a telescope--need be considered; the other four  are of the same order of size as the asteroids, and are indeed much  smaller than Ceres.    But the Galilean satellites are of a higher rank. Europa, the smallest, is  in size a twin to the Moon; Callisto, the outermost, is almost exactly the  size of Mercury; Io, the innermost, is midway between the two in its  dimensions. But Ganymede, the largest, is almost comparable with Mars, its  diameter being 0.45 that of the Earth instead of the 0.53 of Mars.    But the Moon, Mercury, and Mars have all been shown, on the ground of  their small size, to be worlds unfit for habitation; the satellites of  Jupiter are, therefore, all rejected on the same score. Nor can the  greater nearness of their immediate primary compensate for their  remoteness from the Sun. It is true that Jupiter presents to Ganymede a  disc with more than 200 times the apparent area that the Sun presents to  the Earth, but to make up for the falling-off of the solar radiation, each  unit of this area should radiate about 1/250th as much heat as each unit  of the Sun's surface. In other words, the absolute surface temperature of  Jupiter should be 1/4th that of the Sun, or about 1550 deg. C., and this is  higher than can be admitted. The Sun and Jupiter together cannot put  Ganymede in as favourable a position as Mars, much less as favourable as  the Earth.    The case of Jupiter carries with it those of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.  All three, from their high albedoes and low densities, are still in a  vaporous condition; still in some sort, semi-Suns; sources of a certain  amount of heat, and not recipients merely. The days are yet far distant  when a solid crust can form on any one of them, and the water condense  from the steamy atmosphere to form oceans, seas, and rivers. Not till  then, if at all, when water as a liquid, water that flows, is present, can  life begin to appear and enter on its long course of change.          CHAPTER XI    WHEN THE MAJOR PLANETS COOL      The question has been asked: \"It is evident that life cannot exist at the  present time on the outer planets, since they are in a highly heated and  quasi-solar condition; but when they cool down, as cool they must, and a  solid crust is formed, may not a time come when they will be habitable? It  seems impossible to think that worlds so beautiful to our eyes and so vast  in scale are destined never to be peopled by intelligent beings.\"    It is clearly difficult to answer satisfactorily a question that requires  so deep a plunge into the recesses of the unknown future; yet, so far as  our knowledge goes, there is no reason to think that Jupiter will be more  habitable then than it is now. The difficulty of the small supply of light  and heat received from the Sun would apparently still remain, if indeed,  the cooling of the Sun itself would not increase it. We do not know of any  means by which our Sun could so increase its radiation as to supply to  Jupiter from 25 to 30 times as much heat as it now receives, and this  would be necessary to place it in the same favoured condition as the  Earth. If so great a change were to take place in the Sun, life would be  scorched out of existence on all planets nearer than Jupiter, and,  similarly, if the solar emission were increased to meet the necessities of  Uranus or Neptune, even Jupiter would fall a victim.    But we may consider it as a conceivable case that a planet of the exact  dimensions of Jupiter may be revolving in an annual period of the same  length as his, round some star that is capable of affording it adequate  nourishment; and so with the three other giant planets. The actual Jupiter  and Saturn of the solar system have, so far as we can tell, neither  present nor future as habitable worlds, but we can consider what would be  the case of imaginary bodies of similar dimensions in systems where the  supply of heat would be sufficient. Or we can neglect the question of  temperature altogether, as we did at first in the case of Mars.    All the four planets must shrink much in volume before their  solidification will take place. Their average density at present but  little exceeds that of water; indeed, Saturn is not so dense as water; yet  we must suppose that the same elements are in general common to the Earth  and to them all. If we assume, then, that the four planets all cool to the  point of solidification, their densities must be much increased, and their  volumes correspondingly diminished. Since all four greatly exceed the  Earth in mass, it is but natural to expect that, when they have assumed  the terrestrial condition, they will be more closely compacted than the  Earth, and their densities in consequence will be greater. It will,  however, be simpler if we assume exactly the same density for them as for  the Earth. Jupiter will then have shrunk to about one-fourth of its  present volume, and the statistics for the four planets will run as in the  following Table:    STATISTICS OF THE FOUR OUTER PLANETS IF WITH THE SAME DENSITY AS THE EARTH      PROPORTIONS OF THE PLANETS:--                                         Uranus  Neptune  Saturn  Jupiter      Diameter in miles                  19300    20400    36000   54000        do                [Symbol] = 1    2.44     2.57     4.56    6.82      Surface,            [Symbol] = 1    6.0      6.6     20.8    46.6      Mass and Volume,    [Symbol] = 1   14.6     17.0     94.8   317.7      Gravity at surface, [Symbol] = 1    2.44     2.57     4.56    6.82    Rate of Fall, Feet in      the First Second                   39.2     41.3     73.3   109.7      ATMOSPHERE, assuming the    total mass of the atmosphere    to be proportional to    the mass of the planet:--      Pressure at the surface in lb.      per square inch                    88.2     97.0    305.8   685.0    Pressure at the surface in      \"atmospheres\"                       6.0      6.6     20.8    46.6    Level of half-pressure in miles       1.37     1.30     0.73    0.49    Boiling point of water at      surface                            127 deg.C    129 deg.C    148 deg.C   164 deg.C    Jupiter offers two peculiarities.
