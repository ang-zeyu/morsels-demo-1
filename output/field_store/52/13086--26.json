This village consisted of a few Indian huts, built around  a large open square, and on one side was a sort of shed for a casa  real. It had no church or cura, and already we experienced a difficulty  which we did not expect to encounter so soon. The population consisted  entirely of Indians, who in general throughout the country speak  nothing but the Maya; there was not a white man in the place, nor any  one who could speak in any tongue that we could comprehend.  Fortunately, a muleteer from the interior, on his way to Merida, had  stopped to bait his mules under the shade of a large tree, and was  swinging in a hammock in the casa real. He was surprised at our  undertaking alone a journey into the interior, seeing that we were  brought to a stand at the first village from the capital; but, finding  us somewhat rational in other respects, he assisted us in procuring  ramon leaves and water for the horses. His life had been passed in  driving mules from a region of country called the Sierra, to the  capital; but he had heard strange stories about foreign countries, and,  among others, that in El Norte a man could earn a dollar a day by his  labour; but he was comforted when he learned that a real in his country  was worth more to him than a dollar would be in ours; and as he  interpreted to his nearly naked companions, crouching in the shade,  nothing touched them so nearly as the idea of cold and frost, and  spending a great portion of the day's earnings for fuel to keep from  freezing.    At three o'clock we left the hamlet, and at a little after four we saw  the towers of the church of Tekoh. In the suburbs of this village we  passed the campo santo, a large enclosure with high stone walls; over  the gateway of which, and in niches along the top of the wall, was a  row of human skulls. Inside the enclosure, at the farthest extremis,  was a pile of skulls and bones, which, according to a custom of the  Indians observed from time immemorial, had been dug up from the graves  and thrown into this shallow pit, a grim and ghastly charnel-house.    The village consisted of a long, straight street, with houses or huts  almost hidden by foliage, and inhabited exclusively by Indians. We rode  up to the plaza without meeting a single person. At one side of the  plaza, on a high stone platform, stood a  gigantic church, with two  lofty towers, and in front and on each side was a broad flight of stone  steps. Crossing the plaza we saw an Indian woman, to whom we uttered  the word _convento_, and, following the direction of her hand, rode up  to the house of the cura. It was in the rear of the church, and  enclosed by a large wall. The gate was closed, but we opened it without  knocking. The convent stood on the same platform with the church, and  had a high flight of stone steps. A number of Indian servants ran out  to the corridor, to stare at such strange-looking persons, and we  understood that the padre was not at home; but we were too well pleased  with the appearance of things to think of going elsewhere. We tied our  horses in the yard, ascended the steps, and strolled through the  corridor of the convent and along the platform of the church,  overlooking the village.    Before the door of the church lay the body of a child on a bier. There  was no coffin, but the body was wrapped in a tinsel dress of paper of  different colours, in which red and gold were predominant; and amid  this finery worms several inches long were issuing from its nostrils,  curling and twisting over its face: a piteous and revolting spectacle,  showing the miserable lot of the children of the poor in these Indian  villages.    In a few minutes the ministro, or assistant of the cura, joined us,  from whom we learned that the cura was preparing to bury this child,  and as soon as it was over, would come to receive us. In the mean time,  under his escort, we ascended to the top of the church.    The ascent was by a large stone staircase within one of the towers. The  top commanded a view of a great plain, covered by an almost boundless  forest, extending on one side to the sea, and on the other to the  sierra which crosses the peninsula of Yucatan, and runs back to the  great traversing range in Guatimala, broken only by a high mound, which  at three leagues' distance towered above the plain, a mourning monument  of the ruins of Mayapan, the capital of the fallen kingdom of Maya.    On our return we found the cura, Don Jose Canuta Vela, waiting to  receive us; he had been notified of our coming, and had expected us the  day before. His curacy consisted of nearly two thousand souls, and,  except his ministro, we did not see a white man among this population.  He was under thirty, born and bred in Merida, and in manners and  attainments apparently out of place in such a position; but his  feelings and sympathies were identified with the people under his  charge. The convent was a great stone building, with walls several feet  thick, and in size corresponded with the church. Being so near Merida,  it was more than ordinarily well supplied with comforts; and, among  other things, the cura had a small collection of books, which, for that  country, constituted quite a library.    He relieved us of all difficulty arising from the want of an  interpreter, and, sending for the Indian alcaldes, made immediate  arrangements to forward our luggage, and to accompany us himself the  next day to the ruins of Mayapan. We had again made a beginning with  the padres, and this beginning, in heartiness of welcome and goodness  of cheer, corresponded with all that we had before received at their  hands. We had the choice of cot or hammock for the night, and at  breakfast a group of Indian musicians were seated under the corridor,  who continued making a noise, which they called la musica, till we  mounted to depart.    The cura accompanied us, mounted on one of the best horses we had seen  in the country; and as it was a rare thing for him to absent himself a  day from his parochial duties, he set out as for a holy-day excursion,  worrying our poor nags, as well as ourselves, to keep up with him.    The road upon which we entered turned off abruptly from the camino  real. This royal road itself, like most of the others which bore that  name, would not be considered, in other countries, as indicating a very  advanced state of internal improvement, but the one into which we now  struck was much rougher and more stony, entirely new, and in some  places still unfinished. It had been but lately opened, and the reason  of its being opened at all illustrates one striking feature in the  character of the Indians. The village to which it leads was under the  pastoral charge of our friendly companion, and was formerly reached by  a road, or rather path, so circuitous and difficult that, on account of  his other duties, he was obliged to give notice that he would be  compelled to give it up. To prevent this calamity, all the Indians, in  a body, turned out and made this new road, being a straight cut through  the woods, two leagues in length.    The padre took a lively interest in the zeal lately awakened for  exploring the antiquities of the country, and told us that this  particular region abounded with traces of the ancient inhabitants. At a  short distance from the camino real we came to a line of fallen stones,  forming what appeared to be the remains of a wall which crossed the  road, and ran off into the forest on both sides, traversing, he said,  the country for a great distance in both directions.    A short distance beyond, we turned off to a large hollow basin  perfectly dry, which he called an aguada, and said it was an artificial  formation, excavated and walled around, and had been used by the  ancients as a reservoir for water. At the time, we did not agree with  him, but considered the basin a natural formation, though, from what we  saw afterward, we are induced to believe that his account may have been  correct.    At ten o'clock we reached the small village of Telchaquillo, containing  a population of six hundred souls, and these, again, were all Indians.  It was they who had made the road we had travelled over, and the church  was under our friend's pastoral charge. We rode to the convent, and  dismounted. Immediately the bell of the church tolled, to give notice  of his arrival, that all who wished to confess or get married, who had  sick to be visited, children to be baptized, or dead to be buried,  might apply to him, and have their wants attended to.    The village consisted entirely of huts, or casas de paja. The church  had been commenced on a large scale, under the direction of a former  cura, who afterward became dissatisfied with the people, and  discontinued the building. One end was covered over, and fitted up  rudely as a chapel; beyond were two high walls, but roofless.    In the square of this little village was a great senote, or  subterraneous well, which supplied all the inhabitants with water. At a  distance the square seemed level and unbroken; but women walking across  it with cantaros or water-jars suddenly disappeared, and others seemed  to rise out of the earth. On a nearer approach, we found a great  orifice or opening in the rocky surface, like the mouth of a cave. The  descent was by irregular steps cut and worn in the rocks. Over head was  an immense rocky roof, and at a distance of perhaps five hundred feet  from the mouth was a large basin or reservoir of water. Directly over  the water the roof was perhaps sixty feet high; and there was an  opening above which threw down a strong body of light. The water had no  current, and its source was a mystery. During the rainy season it rises  a little, but never falls below a certain point, and at all times  it is the only source of supply to the inhabitants. Women, with their  water-jars, were constantly ascending and descending; swallows were  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#19)"],[1,"road toward the Hooge crater, and  those trenches which were battered to pieces but not abandoned in the  first battle of Ypres and the second battle.    That salient was, even then, in 1915, a graveyard of British  soldiers--there were years to follow when many more would lie there--and  as between flash and flash the scene was revealed, I seemed to see a  great army of ghosts, the spirits of all those boys who had died on this  ground. It was the darkness, and the tumult of guns, and our loneliness  here on the ramparts, which put an edge to my nerves and made me see  unnatural things.    No wonder a sentry was startled when he saw our two figures approaching  him through a clump of trees. His words rang out like pistol-shots.    \"Halt! Who goes there?\"    \"Friends!\" we shouted, seeing the gleam of light on a shaking bayonet.    \"Come close to be recognized!\" he said, and his voice was harsh.    We went close, and I for one was afraid. Young sentries sometimes shot  too soon.    \"Who are you?\" he asked, in a more natural voice, and when we explained  he laughed gruffly. \"I never saw two strangers pass this way before!\"    He was an old soldier, \"back to the army again,\" with Kitchener's men.  He had been in the Chitral campaign and South Africa--\"Little wars  compared to this,\" as he said. A fine, simple man, and although a  bricklayer's laborer in private life, with a knowledge of the right  word. I was struck when he said that the German flares were more  \"luminous\" than ours. I could hardly see his face in the darkness,  except when he struck a match once, but his figure was black against the  illumined sky, and I watched the motion of his arm as he pointed to the  roads up which his comrades had gone to the support of another battalion  at Hooge, who were hard pressed. \"They went along under a lot of  shrapnel and had many casualties.\"    He told the story of that night in a quiet, thoughtful way, with phrases  of almost biblical beauty in their simple truth, and the soul of the  man, the spirit of the whole army in which he was a private soldier, was  revealed when he flashed out a sentence with his one note of fire, \"But  the enemy lost more than we did, sir, that night!\"    We wandered away again into the darkness, with the din of the  bombardment all about us. There was not a square yard of ground unplowed  by shells and we did not nourish any false illusions as to finding a  safe spot for a bivouac.    There was no spot within the ramparts of Ypres where a man might say \"No  shells will fall here.\" But one place we found where there seemed some  reasonable odds of safety. There also, if sleep assailed us, we might  curl up in an abandoned dugout and hope that it would not be \"crumped\"  before the dawn. There were several of these shelters there, but,  peering into them by the light of a match, I shuddered at the idea of  lying in one of them. They had been long out of use and there was a foul  look about the damp bedding and rugs which had been left to rot there.  They were inhabited already by half-wild cats--the abandoned cats of  Ypres, which hunted mice through the ruins of their old houses--and  they spat at me and glared with green-eyed fear as I thrust a match into  their lairs.    There were two kitchen chairs, with a deal table on which we put our  cake and Cointreau, and here, through half a night, my friend and I  sat watching and listening to that weird scene upon which the old moon  looked down; and, as two men will at such a time, we talked over all the  problems of life and death and the meaning of man's heritage.    Another sentry challenged us--all his nerves jangled at our apparition.  He was a young fellow, one of \"Kitchener's crowd,\" and told us frankly  that he had the \"jimjams\" in this solitude of Ypres and \"saw Germans\"  every time a rat jumped. He lingered near us--\"for company.    It was becoming chilly. The dew made our clothes damp. Cake and sweet  liquor were poor provisions for the night, and the thought of hot  tea was infinitely seductive. Perhaps somewhere one might find a few  soldiers round a kettle in some friendly dugout. We groped our way  along, holding our breath at times as a shell came sweeping overhead or  burst with a sputter of steel against the ramparts. It was profoundly  dark, so that only the glowworms glittered like jewels on black velvet.  The moon had gone down, and inside Ypres the light of the distant flares  only glimmered faintly above the broken walls. In a tunnel of darkness  voices were speaking and some one was whistling softly, and a gleam of  red light made a bar across the grass. We walked toward a group of black  figures, suddenly silent at our approach--obviously startled.    \"Who's there?\" said a voice.    We were just in time for tea--a stroke of luck--with a company of boys  (all Kitchener lads from the Civil Service) who were spending the night  here. They had made a fire behind a screen to give them a little comfort  and frighten off the ghosts, and gossiped with a queer sense of humor,  cynical and blasphemous, but even through their jokes there was a  yearning for the end of a business which was too close to death.    I remember the gist of their conversation, which was partly devised for  my benefit. One boy declared that he was sick of the whole business.    \"I should like to cancel my contract,\" he remarked.    \"Yes, send in your resignation, old lad,\" said another, with ironical  laughter.    \"They'd consider it, wouldn't they? P'raps offer a rise in wages--I  don't think!\"    Another boy said, \"I am a citizen of no mean Empire, but what the hell  is the Empire going to do for me when the next shell blows off both my  bleeding legs?\"    This remark was also received by a gust of subdued laughter, silenced  for a moment by a roar and upheaval of masonry somewhere by the ruins of  the Cloth Hall.    \"Soldiers are prisoners,\" said a boy without any trace of humor. \"You're  lagged, and you can't escape. A 'blighty' is the best luck you can hope  for.\"    \"I don't want to kill Germans,\" said a fellow with a superior accent.  \"I've no personal quarrel against them; and, anyhow, I don't like  butcher's work.\"    \"Christian service, that's what the padre calls it. I wonder if Christ  would have stuck a bayonet into a German stomach--a German with his  hands up. That's what we're asked to do.\"    \"Oh, Christianity is out of business, my child. Why mention it? This is  war, and we're back to the primitive state--B.C. All the same, I say my  little prayers when I'm in a blue funk.    \"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, Look upon a little child.\"    This last remark was the prize joke of the evening, received with much  hilarity, not too loud, for fear of drawing fire--though really no  Germans could have heard any laughter in Ypres.    Nearby, their officer was spending the night. We called on him, and  found him sitting alone in a dugout furnished by odd bits from the  wrecked houses, with waxen flowers in a glass case on the shelf, and  an old cottage clock which ticked out the night, and a velvet armchair  which had been the pride of a Flemish home. He was a Devonshire lad,  with a pale, thoughtful face, and I was sorry for him in his loneliness,  with a roof over his head which would be no proof against a fair-sized  shell.    He expressed no surprise at seeing us. I think he would not have been  surprised if the ghost of Edward the Black Prince had called on him.  He would have greeted him with the same politeness and offered him his  green armchair.    The night passed. The guns slackened down before the dawn. For a little  while there was almost silence, even over the trenches. But as the first  faint glow of dawn crept through the darkness the rifle-fire burst  out again feverishly, and the machine-guns clucked with new spasms of  ferocity. The boys of the New Army, and the Germans facing them, had an  attack of the nerves, as always at that hour.    The flares were still rising, but had the debauched look of belated  fireworks after a night of orgy.    In a distant field a cock crew.    The dawn lightened all the sky, and the shadows crept away from the  ruins of Ypres, and all the ghastly wreckage of the city was revealed  again nakedly. Then the guns ceased for a while, and there was quietude  in the trenches, and out of Ypres, sneaking by side ways, went two tired  figures, padding the hoof with a slouching swiftness to escape the early  morning \"hate\" which was sure to come as soon as a clock in Vlamertinghe  still working in a ruined tower chimed the hour of six.    I went through Ypres scores of times afterward, and during the battles  of Flanders saw it day by day as columns of men and guns and  pack-mules and transports went up toward the ridge which led at last to  Passchendaele. We had big guns in the ruins of Ypres, and round about,  and they fired with violent concussions which shook loose stones, and  their flashes were red through the Flanders mist. Always this capital of  the battlefields was sinister, with the sense of menace about.    \"Steel helmets to be worn. Gas-masks at the alert.\"    So said the traffic man at the crossroads.    As one strapped on one's steel helmet and shortened the strap of one's  gas-mask, the spirit of Ypres touched one's soul icily.          IX      The worst school of war for the sons of gentlemen was, in those early  days, and for long afterward, Hooge. That was the devil's playground  and his chamber of horrors, wherein he devised merry tortures for young  Christian men. It was not far out of Ypres, to the left of the Menin  road, and to the north of Zouave Wood and Sanctuary Wood. For a time  there was a chateau there called the White Chateau, with excellent  stables and good accommodation for one of our brigade staffs, until one  of our generals was killed and others wounded by a shell, which broke up  their conference. Afterward there was no chateau, but only a rubble  of bricks"]]]
