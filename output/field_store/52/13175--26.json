One might also assume that juveniles require  different amounts of water and food than adults. Juveniles have less  dense pelage than adults, and probably are affected more by their  immediate environment because of their relatively poor insulation.  Juveniles might also be in an unfavorable situation insofar as water  conservation is concerned, because they are actively growing, and in  most cases, acquiring new pelage; it is well known that these are times  of stress for the individual.

He found that in the  later stages of pregnancy, females of _P. m. bairdii_ required 36 per  cent more water than non-breeding females; at 14 days after parturition,  nursing females required 111 per cent more water than non-breeding  females, and at weaning time, 158 per cent more water. Dice (1922:35)  reported a 217 per cent increase in drinking of _P. m. bairdii_ before  parturition, and 171 per cent increase while nursing.    Several females of both species were bred prior to the start of the  experiments described herein. As a consequence, it was possible to  determine water and food consumption for lactating females of each  species, and later, for their litters. Pregnant and lactating females,  and newly-weaned litters, were fed laboratory chow throughout this  experiment. The litters were separated from their mothers as soon as the  young were observed to be eating, or no later than 33 days after birth.    Table 11 shows the amounts of water and food consumed by two females of  each species while they were either in the later stages of pregnancy, or  were nursing. Although the data in Table 11 do not cover the full  developmental time of the litters involved, it is obvious that both  lactating females of _P. truei_ and one female of _P. maniculatus_  consumed more water than the average for their species (Table 7). Water  and food consumption was measured for both females of _P. truei_ while  they were nursing. The female that gave birth to litter A was left in  the cage with the male for several days after the litter was born,  resulting in another litter being born about 27 days after the first.  Therefore, the record of this female represents an extreme case of  stress (probably a common occurrence in nature) in which a female is  nursing one litter while she is pregnant with a second.    The record of the female of _P. truei_ that gave birth to litter B is  the most complete, including data from the fifth day after parturition  until the young were weaned on the thirty-third day after parturition.  The record of the female of _P. maniculatus_ that gave birth to litter C  covers the last 10 days of nursing before the young were weaned. After  being separated from her litter, this female drank more than the average  amounts of water, on both high and low protein diets. Although the food  and water were lost several times for the female of _P. maniculatus_  with litter D, the period of time covered by the 14 days when water and  food consumption were measured includes times just prior to parturition  and to weaning of the young.

Conversely, water consumption of the female with litter D was within one  standard deviation of the mean for all adults of _P. maniculatus_. I  infer that at least some lactating females of _P. maniculatus_ are  better adapted to aridity than are some lactating females of _P. truei_.

Fortunately, she  was favoured by weather, and effected her purpose without injury or loss;  but I never reflect upon this piece of service without an inward tribute of  admiration to the daring, skill, and seamanship of Captain Stokes,  Lieutenant Skyring, and Mr. Flinn. {78}    In his journal Captain Stokes says:    \"Incessant rain and thick clouds prevented my completing, until this day  (19th), the observations necessary for making an island, just outside the  Harbour of Mercy, the southern end of my base, for the trigonometrical  connection of the coasts and islands near the western entrance of this  weather-beaten Strait.    \"On the 20th, I weighed and beat to windward, intending to search for  anchorage on the north shore, where I might land and fix the northern end  of our base line. In the evening we anchored in an archipelago of islands,  the real danger of whose vicinity was much increased to the eye by rocks,  scattered in every direction, and high breakers, occasioned doubtless by  reefs under water. We observed that most of the larger islands have small  banks of sand at their eastern sides, on which anchorage may be found; but  for ordinary purposes of navigation, this cluster of islands[63] need only  be pointed out to be avoided. The number and contiguity of the rocks, below  as well as above water, render it a most hazardous place for any  square-rigged vessel: nothing but the particular duty on which I was  ordered would have induced me to venture among them. Fore-and-aft vessels  might work with far less risk; and as the rocks are frequented by vast  numbers of fur seal, a season or two might be profitably passed here by a  sealing vessel so rigged.    \"This morning (21st) I landed on one of the larger islands, with Lieutenant  Skyring, and having ascended an eminence (Observation Mount) with the  necessary instruments, fixed its position, and made it the northern end of  our base.    \"It was a beautiful, and clear day; the Isles of Direction (or  Evangelists), as well as every point of importance on the adjacent coast,  were seen distinctly during several hours.    \"My next object was to fix the position of Cape Victory, and ascertain  whether anchorage could be found in its neighbourhood. Accordingly, we  weighed early next morning (22d,) and after extricating ourselves from this  labyrinth (not without much difficulty and danger), we beat to the  westward. Violent squalls, a heavy sea, and thick weather, which came on  about {79} noon, obliged me to choose the least evil, and run for the  Harbour of Mercy.    \"On the 23d, we went out again, and beat towards the Isles of Direction,  off which we passed a night under sail.    \"The morning of the 24th was very fine, and the wind moderate. Leaving the  Beagle to sound about the Isles of Direction, I set out in my boat, with  two days' provisions, towards Cape Victory. As we rowed along these rocky  shores, threading the mazes of the labyrinth of islets which fringe them,  we saw vast numbers of black whales, and the rocks were quite covered with  fur seal and brant geese.    \"After pulling, in earnest, for six hours, we landed upon Cape Victory, the  north-western limit of the Strait of Magalhaens, and there, with a sextant,  artificial horizon, and chronometer, ascertained the position of this  remarkable promontory. From an eminence, eight hundred feet above the sea,  we had a commanding view of the adjacent coasts, as well as of the vast  Pacific, which enabled us to rectify former material errors. Late in the  evening we were fortunate enough to get safely on board again, which,  considering the usual weather here and the heavy sea, was unexpected  success. This night was passed under sail in the Pacific, and next morning  we commenced our return to Port Famine.    \"When within four or five miles of Cape Pillar, and to the westward of it,  a current was found to set southward, at about two knots an hour. As we  neared the Cape the wind fell, and the Beagle was set rapidly towards those  dangerous rocks, called the Apostles. Fortunately, a commanding breeze  sprung up, and we extricated ourselves from the difficulty. While passing  Cape Pillar, I landed in a cove near it, and determined its position. By  sunset we had arrived near the Harbour of Mercy; and being becalmed, towed  the ship in, with her boats, until an anchor was dropped at the proper  place.    \"On the 26th, we went to Tuesday Bay, and on the 27th crossed the Strait,  and anchored under Cape Parker. I have rarely witnessed such a high, cross,  and irregular sea as we this day passed through, near the strange mass of  rock, called by {80} Narborough, 'Westminster Hall.' The coast about our  unsafe anchorage was as barren and dismal-looking as any part of this  country, which, as the old navigator above-mentioned said, is 'so desolate  land to behold.'    \"Next day (March 1st) we ran down to Cape Upright, and there remained until  the 3d, collecting the required data for our survey.    \"While standing towards the bay called Playa Parda (on the 3d), a boat  under sail was seen making towards us from the southern coast. I fired  several guns, to show our position, before we became shut in by the land,  and soon after anchoring a whale-boat came alongside, with the second mate  and five men belonging to the sealing-vessel Prince of Saxe Cobourg.    \"Anxious not to lose a moment in hastening to the relief of our shipwrecked  countrymen, I ran down next day to Port Gallant, and thence proceeded with  two ten-oared boats (on the 5th) through the Barbara Channel, and the  following evening reached Fury Harbour.\"    Having already given a short account of the Saxe Cobourg's loss, and the  rescue of her crew by Captain Stokes, I will not repeat the story by  extracting more from his journal.    Mr. Graves returned from his cruize in the Hope on the 17th, after  suffering much from stormy weather and incessant rain; but having made a  survey of the openings in the land to the west of Magdalen Channel as far  as the Sugar Loaf Point, at the west head of Lyell Sound, which he found to  be deep inlets, affording no anchorages of value to navigation.    The time having arrived for our return to Monte Video, preparations were  made for sailing, and in the mean time I went to the northward, in the  Hope, to survey the coast between Port Famine and Elizabeth Island,  including Shoal Haven.    At the bottom of Shoal Haven we were stopped by the water shoaling to five  feet, so that we were obliged to haul out till we could anchor in more than  two fathoms. During the night the wind shifted to N.E., and blew right in,  obliging us to weigh, and work under the S.W. end of Elizabeth Island into  a bay close to that shore. From the summit of the S.W. {81} point I  afterwards took angles, among which the most important gave Mount Sarmiento  bearing S. 1-1/2deg W. (true). Its distance must have been (by recent  observations) ninety-four miles.    Elizabeth Island is a long, low strip of land, lying parallel to the shores  of the Strait, which here take a N.N.E. direction. Compared with the land  to the southward it is very low, no part being more than two or three  hundred feet high. It is composed of narrow ranges of hills, extending in  ridges in the direction of its length, over which are strewed boulders of  the various rocks, which have been noticed before as forming the shingle  beaches of Point St. Mary and Point St. Anna; two kinds of rock, greenstone  and hornblende, being the most common. The vallies which divide the hilly  ridges were well clothed with grass, and in many places were seen hollows,  that had contained fresh water, but now were entirely dried up. These spots  were marked by a white crust, apparently caused by the saline quality of  the soil.    Geese and wild ducks, and the red-bill (_Haematopus_), seem to be the only  inhabitants of this island. The Indians sometimes visit it, for at the S.W.  end we found remains of wigwams and shell-fish. Perhaps it is a place  whence they communicate with the Patagonian natives, or they may in the  season frequent it for eggs.    We anchored in Laredo Bay, and visited a lake about a mile from the beach,  distinguished on the chart by the name of Duck Lagoon: it is very  extensive, and covered with large flights of gulls, ducks, and widgeons. We  shot one widgeon, which was a most beautiful bird, and of a species we had  not before seen.[64]    Here the country begins to be clothed with the deciduous leaved Beech tree  (_Fagus Antarctica_), which is stunted in growth, but very convenient for  fuel. Though the hardiest tree of this region, it is never found of large  size, the larger trees being the evergreen Beech (_Fagus betuloides_). We  also met with several small plants common to Cape Gregory. One {82} may  consider Cape Negro to be the boundary of two countries, as entirely  different from each other in geological structure and appearance, as they  are in climate, to which last difference may be attributed the  dissimilarity of their botanical productions.    Hence we returned to Port Famine. In our absence, a boat from the Beagle  had crossed the Strait to Lomas Bay, where a party of natives had kindled  fires of invitation.    The weather, since the sun crossed the equator, had been unusually fine;  and, with the exception of one day's heavy rain, the sky was so clear (the  wind being moderate from the N.E.) that all the heights were exposed to our  view, and amongst them Mount Sarmiento stood pre-eminent.    Our preparations for sailing being nearly completed, the Hope was unrigged  and hoisted in, and our temporary settlement on shore abandoned. It  consisted of a marquee and a large bell tent. In the former was Mr.  Harrison (mate), who had charge of the party, and of the meteorological  instruments: the bell tent held the crew. Near them were the"]]]
