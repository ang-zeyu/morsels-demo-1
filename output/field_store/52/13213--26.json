In one direction only has she forgotten to rivet the  perception to the need. And since each direction corresponds to what we  call a SENSE--through one of his senses, and through that sense alone,  is the artist usually wedded to art. Hence, originally, the diversity  of arts. Hence also the speciality of predispositions. This one applies  himself to colours and forms, and since he loves colour for colour and  form for form, since he perceives them for their sake and not for his  own, it is the inner life of things that he sees appearing through  their forms and colours. Little by little he insinuates it into our own  perception, baffled though we may be at the outset. For a few moments  at least, he diverts us from the prejudices of form and colour that  come between ourselves and reality. And thus he realises the loftiest  ambition of art, which here consists in revealing to us nature. Others,  again, retire within themselves. Beneath the thousand rudimentary  actions which are the outward and visible signs of an emotion, behind  the commonplace, conventional expression that both reveals and conceals  an individual mental state, it is the emotion, the original mood, to  which they attain in its undefiled essence. And then, to induce us to  make the same effort ourselves, they contrive to make us see something  of what they have seen: by rhythmical arrangement of words, which thus  become organised and animated with a life of their own, they tell  us--or rather suggest--things that speech was not calculated to  express. Others delve yet deeper still. Beneath these joys and sorrows  which can, at a pinch, be translated into language, they grasp  something that has nothing in common with language, certain rhythms of  life and breath that. are closer to man than his inmost feelings, being  the living law--varying with each individual--of his enthusiasm and  despair, his hopes and regrets. By setting free and emphasising this  music, they force it upon our attention; they compel us, willy-nilly,  to fall in with it, like passers-by who join in a dance. And thus they  impel us to set in motion, in the depths of our being, some secret  chord which was only waiting to thrill. So art, whether it be painting  or sculpture, poetry or music, has no other object than to brush aside  the utilitarian symbols, the conventional and socially accepted  generalities, in short, everything that veils reality from us, in order  to bring us face to face with reality itself. It is from a  misunderstanding on this point that the dispute between realism and  idealism in art has arisen. Art is certainly only a more direct vision  of reality. But this purity of perception implies a break with  utilitarian convention, an innate and specially localised  disinterestedness of sense or consciousness, in short, a certain  immateriality of life, which is what has always been called idealism.  So that we might say, without in any way playing upon the meaning of  the words, that realism is in the work when idealism is in the soul,  and that it is only through ideality that we can resume contact with  reality.    Dramatic art forms no exception to this law. What drama goes forth to  discover and brings to light, is a deep-seated reality that is veiled  from us, often in our own interests, by the necessities of life. What  is this reality? What are these necessities? Poetry always expresses  inward states. But amongst these states some arise mainly from contact  with our fellow-men. They are the most intense as well as the most  violent. As contrary electricities attract each other and accumulate  between the two plates of the condenser from which the spark will  presently flash, so, by simply bringing people together, strong  attractions and repulsions take place, followed by an utter loss of  balance, in a word, by that electrification of the soul known as  passion. Were man to give way to the impulse of his natural feelings,  were there neither social nor moral law, these outbursts of violent  feeling would be the ordinary rule in life. But utility demands that  these outbursts should be foreseen and averted. Man must live in  society, and consequently submit to rules. And what interest advises,  reason commands: duty calls, and we have to obey the summons. Under  this dual influence has perforce been formed an outward layer of  feelings and ideas which make for permanence, aim at becoming common to  all men, and cover, when they are not strong enough to extinguish it,  the inner fire of individual passions. The slow progress of mankind in  the direction of an increasingly peaceful social life has gradually  consolidated this layer, just as the life of our planet itself has been  one long effort to cover over with a cool and solid crust the fiery  mass of seething metals. But volcanic eruptions occur. And if the earth  were a living being, as mythology has feigned, most likely when in  repose it would take delight in dreaming of these sudden explosions,  whereby it suddenly resumes possession of its innermost nature. Such is  just the kind of pleasure that is provided for us by drama. Beneath the  quiet humdrum life that reason and society have fashioned for us, it  stirs something within us which luckily does not explode, but which it  makes us feel in its inner tension. It offers nature her revenge upon  society. Sometimes it makes straight for the goal, summoning up to the  surface, from the depths below, passions that produce a general  upheaval. Sometimes it effects a flank movement, as is often the case  in contemporary drama; with a skill that is frequently sophistical, it  shows up the inconsistencies of society; it exaggerates the shams and  shibboleths of the social law; and so indirectly, by merely dissolving  or corroding the outer crust, it again brings us back to the inner  core. But, in both cases, whether it weakens society or strengthens  nature, it has the same end in view: that of laying bare a secret  portion of ourselves,--what might be called the tragic element in our  character.    This is indeed the impression we get after seeing a stirring drama.  What has just interested us is not so much what we have been told about  others as the glimpse we have caught of ourselves--a whole host of  ghostly feelings, emotions and events that would fain have come into  real existence, but, fortunately for us, did not. It also seems as if  an appeal had been made within us to certain ancestral memories  belonging to a far-away past--memories so deep-seated and so foreign to  our present life that this latter, for a moment, seems something unreal  and conventional, for which we shall have to serve a fresh  apprenticeship. So it is indeed a deeper reality that drama draws up  from beneath our superficial and utilitarian attainments, and this art  has the same end in view as all the others.    Hence it follows that art always aims at what is INDIVIDUAL. What the  artist fixes on his canvas is something he has seen at a certain spot,  on a certain day, at a certain hour, with a colouring that will never  be seen again. What the poet sings of is a certain mood which was his,  and his alone, and which will never return. What the dramatist unfolds  before us is the life-history of a soul, a living tissue of feelings  and events--something, in short, which has once happened and can never  be repeated. We may, indeed, give general names to these feelings, but  they cannot be the same thing in another soul. They are INDIVIDUALISED.  Thereby, and thereby only, do they belong to art; for generalities,  symbols or even types, form the current coin of our daily perception.  How, then, does a misunderstanding on this point arise?    The reason lies in the fact that two very different things have been  mistaken for each other: the generality of things and that of the  opinions we come to regarding them. Because a feeling is generally  recognised as true, it does not follow that it is a general feeling.  Nothing could be more unique than the character of Hamlet. Though he  may resemble other men in some respects, it is clearly not on that  account that he interests us most. But he is universally accepted and  regarded as a living character. In this sense only is he universally  true. The same holds good of all the other products of art. Each of  them is unique, and yet, if it bear the stamp of genius, it will come  to be accepted by everybody. Why will it be accepted? And if it is  unique of its kind, by what sign do we know it to be genuine?  Evidently, by the very effort it forces us to make against our  predispositions in order to see sincerely. Sincerity is contagious.  What the artist has seen we shall probably never see again, or at least  never see in exactly the same way; but if he has actually seen it, the  attempt he has made to lift the veil compels our imitation. His work is  an example which we take as a lesson. And the efficacy of the lesson is  the exact standard of the genuineness of the work. Consequently, truth  bears within itself a power of conviction, nay, of conversion, which is  the sign that enables us to recognise it. The greater the work and the  more profound the dimly apprehended truth, the longer may the effect be  in coming, but, on the other hand, the more universal will that effect  tend to become. So the universality here lies in the effect produced,  and not in the cause.    Altogether different is the object of comedy. Here it is in the work  itself that the generality lies. Comedy depicts characters we have  already come across and shall meet with again. It takes note of  similarities. It aims at placing types before our eyes. It even creates  new types, if necessary. In this respect it forms a contrast to all the  other arts.    The very titles of certain classical comedies are significant in  themselves.

He has shown that he  knows some clever magic, and perhaps I shall not be able to foil it.  So it will be well for us to escape tonight if possible.\"    \"Can you fight and conquer the big sea devil up in the dome?\" asked  Trot.    The queen was thoughtful, and did not reply to this question at  once. But Cap'n Bill said uneasily, \"I can't abide them devil  critters, an' I hopes, for my part, we won't be called on to tackle  'em. You see, Trot, we're in consider'ble of a bad mess, an' if we  ever live to tell the tale--\"    \"Why not, Cap'n?\" asked the child. \"We're safe enough so far. Can't  you trust our good friend, the queen?\"    \"She don't seem plumb sure o' things herself,\" remarked the sailor.  \"The mermaids is all right an' friendly, mate, but this 'ere magic  maker, ol' Zog, is a bad one, out 'n' out, an' means to kill us if  he can.\"    \"But he can't!\" cried Trot bravely.    \"I hope you're right, dear. I wouldn't want to bet on Zog's chances  jes' yet, an' at the same time it would be riskin' money to bet on  our chances. Seems to me it's a case of luck which wins.\"    \"Don't worry, friend,\" said the Queen. \"I have a plan to save us.  Let us wait patiently until nightfall.\" They waited in the Rose  Chamber a long time, talking earnestly together, but the brilliant  light that flooded both the room and the great dome outside did not  fade in the least. After several hours had passed away, the gong  sounded and Tom Atto again appeared, followed by four slaves bearing  many golden dishes upon silver trays. The friendly cook had prepared  a fine dinner, and they were all glad to find that, whatever Zog  intended to do to them, he had no intention of starving them.  Perhaps the magician realized that Aquareine's fairy powers, if put  to the test, would be able to provide food for her companions, but  whatever his object may have been, their enemy had given them  splendid rooms and plenty to eat.    \"Isn't it nearly nighttime?\" asked the Queen as Tom Atto spread the  table with a cloth of woven seaweed and directed his men to place  the dishes upon it.    \"Night!\" he exclaimed as if surprised. \"There is no night here.\"    \"Doesn't it ever get dark?\" inquired Trot.    \"Never. We know nothing of the passage of time or of day or night.  The light always shines just as you see it now, and we sleep  whenever we are tired and rise again as soon as we are rested.\"    \"What causes the light?\" Princess Clia asked.    \"It's magic, your Highness,\" said the cook solemnly. \"It's one of  the curious things Zog is able to do. But you must remember all this  place is a big cave in which the castle stands, so the light is  never seen by anyone except those who live here.\"    \"But why does Zog keep his light going all the time?\" asked the  Queen.    \"I suppose it is because he himself never sleeps,\" replied Tom Atto.  \"They say the master hasn't slept for hundreds of years, not since  Anko, the sea serpent, defeated him and drove him into this place.\"    They asked no more questions and began to eat their dinner in  silence. Before long, Cap'n Joe came in to visit his brother and  took a seat at the table with the prisoners. He proved a jolly  fellow, and when he and Cap'n Bill talked about their boyhood days,  the stories were so funny that everybody laughed and for a time  forgot their worries.    When dinner was over, however, and Cap'n Joe had gone back to his  work of sewing on buttons and the servants had carried away the  dishes, the prisoners remembered their troubles and the fate that  awaited them. \"I am much disappointed,\" said the Queen, \"to find  there is no night here and that Zog never sleeps. It will make our  escape more difficult. Yet we must make the attempt, and as we are  tired and a great struggle is before us, it will be best for us to  sleep and refresh ourselves.\"    They agreed to this, for the day had been long and adventurous, so  Cap'n Bill kissed Trot and went in to the Peony Room, where he lay  down upon his spongy couch and fell fast asleep. The mermaids and  Trot followed this example, and I think none of them was much  worried, after all, because they quickly sank into peaceful slumber  and forgot all the dangers that threatened them.          CHAPTER 17    THE QUEEN'S GOLDEN SWORD      \"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Trot, raising herself by a flirt of her  pink-scaled tail and a wave of her fins, \"isn't it dreadful hot  here?\"    The mermaids had risen at the same time, and Cap'n Bill came  swimming in from the Peony Room in time to hear the little girl's  speech.    \"Hot!\" echoed the sailor. \"Why, I feel like the inside of a steam  engine!\"    The perspiration was rolling down his round, red face, and he took  out his handkerchief and carefully wiped it away, waving his fish  tail gently at the same time.    \"What we need most in this room,\" said he, \"is a fan.\"    \"What's the trouble, do you s'pose?\" inquired Trot.    \"It is another trick of the monster Zog,\" answered the Queen calmly.  \"He has made the water in our rooms boiling hot, and if it could  touch us, we would be well cooked by this time. Even as it is, we  are all made uncomfortable by breathing the heated air.\"    \"What shall we do, ma'am?\" the sailor man asked with a groan. \"I  expected to get into hot water afore we've done with this  foolishness, but I don't like the feel o' bein' parboiled, jes' the  same.\"    The queen was waving her fairy wand and paid no attention to Cap'n  Bill's moans. Already the water felt cooler, and they began to  breathe more easily. In a few moments more, the heat had passed from  the surrounding water altogether, and all danger from this source  was over.    \"This is better,\" said Trot gratefully.    \"Do you care to sleep again?\" asked the Queen.    \"No, I'm wide awake now,\" answered the child.    \"I'm afraid if I goes to sleep ag'in, I'll wake up a pot roast,\"  said Cap'n Bill.    \"Let us consider ways to escape,\" suggested Clia. \"It seems useless  for us to remain here quietly until Zog discovers a way to destroy  us.\"    \"But we must not blunder,\" added Aquareine cautiously. \"To fail in  our attempt would be to acknowledge Zog's superior power, so we must  think well upon our plan before we begin to carry it out. What do  you advise, sir?\" she asked, turning to Cap'n Bill.    \"My opinion, ma'am, is that the only way for us to escape is to get  out o' here,\" was the sailor's vague answer. \"How to do it is your  business, seein' as I ain't no fairy myself, either in looks or in  eddication.\"    The queen smiled and said to Trot, \"What is your opinion, my dear?\"    \"I think we might swim out the same way we came in,\" answered the  child. \"If we could get Sacho to lead us back through the maze, we  would follow that long tunnel to the open ocean, and--\"    \"And there would be the sea devils waitin' for us,\" added Cap'n Bill  with a shake of his bald head. \"They'd drive us back inter the  tunnel like they did the first time, Trot. It won't do, mate, it  won't do.\"    \"Have you a suggestion, Clia?\" inquired the Queen.    \"I have thought of an undertaking,\" replied the pretty princess,  \"but it is a bold plan, your Majesty, and you may not care to risk  it.\"    \"Let us hear it, anyway,\" said Aquareine encouragingly.    \"It is to destroy Zog himself and put him out of the world forever.  Then we would be free to go home whenever we pleased.\"    \"Can you suggest a way to destroy Zog?\" asked Aquareine.    \"No, your Majesty,\" Clia answered. \"I must leave the way for you to  determine.\"    \"In the old days,\" said the Queen thoughtfully, \"the mighty King  Anko could not destroy this monster. He succeeded in defeating Zog  and drove him into this great cavern, but even Anko could not  destroy him.\"    \"I have heard the sea serpent explain that it was because he could  not reach the magician,\" returned Clia. \"If King Anko could have  seized Zog in his coils, he would have made an end of the wicked  monster quickly. Zog knows this, and that is why he does not venture  forth from his retreat. Anko is the enemy he constantly dreads. But  with you, my queen, the case is different. You may easily reach Zog,  and the only question is whether your power is sufficient to destroy  him.\"    For a while Aquareine remained silent. \"I am not sure of my power  over him,\" she said at last, \"and for that reason I hesitate to  attack him personally. His slaves and his allies, the sea devils, I  can easily conquer, so I prefer to find a way to overcome the guards  at the entrances rather than to encounter their terrible master. But  even the guards have been given strength and power by the magician,  as we have already discovered, so I must procure a weapon with which  to fight them.\"    \"A weapon, ma'am?\" said Cap'n Bill, and then he took a jackknife  from his coat pocket and opened the big blade, afterward handing it  to the queen. \"That ain't a bad weapon,\" he announced.    \"But it is useless in this case,\" she replied, smiling at the old  sailor's earnestness. \"For my purpose I must have a golden sword.\"    \"Well, there's plenty of gold around this castle,\" said Trot,  looking around her. \"Even in this room there's enough to make a  hundred golden swords.\"    \"But we can't melt or forge gold under water, mate,\" the Cap'n said.    \"Why not? Don't you s'pose all these gold roses and things were made  under water?\" asked the little girl.    \"Like enough,\" remarked the sailor, \"but I don't see how.\"    Just then the gong at the door sounded, and the boy Sacho came in  smiling and cheerful as ever. He said Zog had sent him to inquire  after their health and happiness. \"You may tell him that his water  became a trifle too warm, so we cooled it,\" replied the Queen. Then  they told Sacho how the boiling water had made them uncomfortable  while they slept. "]]]
