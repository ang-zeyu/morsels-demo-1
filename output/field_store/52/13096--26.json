The roof is good and steep.  Yes, I like a ridge roof and half pitch them, you do not have to make  the body so high. Yes, I always chunk well and calk good with moss  before I mud it, then you have a good warm camp.

Fred we must bunk down for we must be moving  early in the morning.\"    \"Come, Fred, turn out, I have breakfast about ready.\"    \"Why it is not morning, is it?\"    \"Yes, it is six o'clock and we must be moving as soon as we can see,  for we have a big day's work before us. Yes, Fred, everything tastes  good in the woods. I suppose a keen appetite has something to do with  that. Well, it is light, so that we can see to travel, so we will be  going. Yes, Fred, you can come over with me again and I will show you  how to set traps, many different ways, to catch different animals,  and we might have a bear in a pen.\"    \"Do you catch bear in a pen?\"    \"Yes, and I like a pen for a bear better than a steel trap. No  getting away if the pen is properly made.\"    \"Well, here is the bear trap and there has been a wild cat at work at  those inwards, so you see I did not bring that trap along for  nothing. Fred, you place a few of those bushy limbs around on the  upper side of those inwards, while I set the trap. There, that is all  right, we will staple to this limb. Yes, he will be quite likely to  get into the trap if he comes again, for he can't get at the bait  very well from any other way, only over the trap.\"    \"How far is it from where the bear trap was set?\"    \"About one-half mile. Yes, I suppose he dragged that trap three or  four miles to get that distance. Here we are, it will not be a long  job to set that trap as he has not torn the bait trap down. Fred, you  get the clamps from the knapsack, while I cut that bushy tree for a  clog. Yes, we let those limbs stick out about ten inches so that they  will catch in the brush and on logs, and that bothers, you see. Yes,  those lungs and liver are all right for bait as long as it is fresh.  A bear does not like tainted meat. Well, that is all right now, we  will go to camp and get a bite to eat, and then pull for home and get  the horse and wagon and come out and take the bear meat and the skin  in. Yes, we always ship the saddles to New York, they bring a good  price.    \"Yes, it is more of a knack to stretch a bear skin right than any  other skin. Here we are at camp again, we will eat a bite and then  pull for home. Good bye, Fred, yes, you shall go again.\"        CHAPTER IX.    Bears in 1870, To-Day--Other Notes.    One not familiar with the conditions of a wild woods life would  naturally think that bears would diminish in proportion to deer and  wild animals. However, this does not seem to be the case. Forty years  ago, trappers of bear were not as numerous as at the present time.  People at that time, hunted more for profit than sport and their  forte was the slaughter of deer. In those days it was nothing  uncommon to see sleigh loads of deer pass every day on the way to  market.    After the first tracking snows of the season, the deer killed in this  county (Potter) were hauled by team thirty and forty miles to the  nearest railroad station and shipped to New York and Philadelphia but  this is not what we wish to write of. We only speak of this to show  that the man of forty years ago was of the trail, rather than the  trap line.    Forty years ago, the writer was acquainted with nearly every hunter  and trapper who made a business of hunting or trapping in this and  adjoining counties. Men who made a business of trapping bear as well  as hunting deer could be counted on the fingers of your hands, and  the grounds on which they operated were the counties of Clinton,  McKean, Cameron and Potter.    The names of these men who perhaps were the most interested in bear  trapping in the section above mentioned were, Leroy Lyman, Horatio  Nelson, Lanson Stephan, Isaac Pollard, Ezery Prichard and one or two  others, including the writer.    The traps mostly used were bear pens and deadfalls. It was considered  a fairly good day's work for two men to build one good bear pen or  two good deadfalls. Most bear trappers, however, had a few steel bear  traps for it may be said that nearly every country blacksmith knew  how to make a bear trap and how to temper a trap spring. This cannot  be said of the average blacksmith of the present day.    Bear forty years ago would migrate then as they do now. We used to  think that bear would travel from the Virginias and from Northern New  York if not from the New England States to Pennsylvania or from  Pennsylvania north or south as the case may be. This was proven from  the fact that if there was a good crop of mast in one locality, while  a scarcity in another, the bear would all seem to be moved north or  south as the case may be as though they had some way of informing one  another where plenty of food was to be found. At such times when bear  are on a migratory tramp it is not an uncommon thing to find a bear  track near your house or barn on going out in the morning when there  was snow on, so that the track is plain to be seen. This was no  uncommon thing forty years ago, neither is it at the present time  (1910) when there is a general scarcity of forage crops such as beech  nuts, chestnuts and acorns. I have seen it stated by some writers  that at certain times bear will move in a drove and at such times it  was not safe for a man to meet a bear for they were very dangerous  and would attack any one who chanced to be in their way.    In my upwards of fifty years experience of woods life, I do not call  to mind of ever seeing more than three bears on one trail at the same  time and these were an old bear and cubs. It has been the writer's  observation that when bears were on these migratory trips in search  of food or from other cause, they travel singly and not in droves or  even in pairs.    During the summer when bears are existing on nettles, wild turnips,  berries and other green food, it is not out of the ordinary to find a  bear in pretty close proximity to the farm house and close around the  fields where he can occasionally get a sheep or lamb.    I have seen and heard much written and said of bear raising from  their hind feet to attract people's attention who chanced to come in  their way when in the woods. I have never seen a bear raise on his  hind feet for battle, in any case, when a hunter or trapper  approaches them. I have often seen them sit upon their haunches to  listen when they heard a noise and were not sure of its origin.    As to the number of bear at the present time and forty or fifty years  ago, through Northern and Central Pennsylvania, there seems to be  about as many now as there were then. This I attribute to the fact  that much of the country in other localities has been cleared up and  thus deprived bruin of his natural haunts.    Forty years ago,--in the early 70's--it was customary then as now, to  keep tab on trappers as to what they were doing along the trap line.  Trappers of years ago would average from three to twelve bears,  according to how plenty they were and to what the condition of the  weather was.    It often happens that when bear are plenty on the trapper's trapping  grounds, he does not have the best of luck in taking the game. If  shack is very plentiful it is sometimes difficult to get the bear to  take ordinary bait. The bear will also den up or go into hibernation  much quicker if they get fat, than they will if shack is a little  scarce so that they do not get quite so fleshy. If the bears get real  fleshy early in the season they will den up at the approach of the  first cold and freezing weather and sleep until spring. On the other  hand, if the bear continues to be a little lean, as he generally is  during the summer, he will continue to search for food during quite  severe weather. They will leave winter quarters and come out in  search of food when there are a few warm days, or a slight thaw,  which they will rarely do if they go into the den in good flesh.    The bear is not like the raccoon. Their rutting season in this  latitude is in August and not in February and March as with the  raccoon and groundhog. Now all of these conditions has much to do  with the number of bears that a trapper may get during a season. The  number of bear taken in Pennsylvania by the average trapper at the  present time and forty years ago may be slightly less now than then  but the difference is not great.    There are more bear trappers today than forty years ago. During the  months of October and November, 1909, there were nearly one hundred  bears caught in traps and killed with dogs in the above counties  mentioned. Bears were more plentiful through this section than usual  this season, although they did not work north into the beech timber  until about the first of November, owing to a heavy crop of chestnuts  and acorns farther south.    Comrades of the trap line, if I was in a section of country where  large game was as plentiful as it was here fifty years ago, I would  not be able to get very far into tall timber, but as it gets  monotonous to write of skunk, muskrat and rabbit hunting of to-day, I  will tell of some of my experiences of fifty years ago, when it was  my custom to hunt deer and bear for profit and pleasure. In those  days I made it a point to be in the woods with my bear traps and  rifle by the middle of October each year, if health permitted.    In those days all that a trapper and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#19)"],[1," heavy lattice, of which the decayed and blackened wood seemed on guard  before some tragic or weary secret. Before me was the entrance to the  mosque of Ibn-Tulun, older than any mosque in Cairo save only the mosque  of Amru. It is approached by a flight of steps, on each side of which  stand old, impenetrable houses. Above my head, strung across from one  house to the other, were many little red and yellow flags ornamented  with gold lozenges. These were to bear witness that in a couple of days'  time, from the great open place beneath the citadel of Cairo, the Sacred  Carpet was to set out on its long journey to Mecca. My guide struck on a  door and uttered a fierce cry. A small shutter in the blackened lattice  was opened, and a young girl, with kohl-tinted eyelids, and a brilliant  yellow handkerchief tied over her coarse black hair, leaned out, held a  short parley, and vanished, drawing the shutter to behind her. The  mist crept about the tawdry flags, a heavy door creaked, whined on  its hinges, and from the house of the girl there came an old, fat man  bearing a mighty key. In a moment I was free of the mosque of Ibn-Tulun.    I ascended the steps, passed through a doorway, and found myself on a  piece of waste ground, flanked on the right by an old, mysterious wall,  and on the left by the long wall of the mosque, from which close to  me rose a grey, unornamented minaret, full of the plain dignity of  unpretending age. Upon its summit was perched a large and weary-looking  bird with draggled feathers, which remained so still that it seemed to  be a sad ornament set there above the city, and watching it for ever  with eyes that could not see. At right angles, touching the mosque,  was such a house as one can see only in the East--fantastically old,  fantastically decayed, bleared, discolored, filthy, melancholy, showing  hideous windows, like windows in the slum of a town set above coal-pits  in a colliery district, a degraded house, and yet a house which roused  the imagination and drove it to its work. In this building once dwelt  the High Priest of the mosque. This dwelling, the ancient wall, the  grey minaret with its motionless bird, the lamentable waste ground at my  feet, prepared me rightly to appreciate the bit of old Cairo I had come  to see.    People who are bored by Gothic churches would not love the mosque of  Ibn-Tulun. No longer is it used for worship. It contains no praying  life. Abandoned, bare, and devoid of all lovely ornament, it stands like  some hoary patriarch, naked and calm, waiting its destined end  without impatience and without fear. It is a fatalistic mosque, and is  impressive, like a fatalistic man. The great court of it, three hundred  feet square, with pointed arches supported by piers, double, and on  the side looking toward Mecca quintuple arcades, has a great dignity of  sombre simplicity. Not grace, not a light elegance of soaring beauty,  but massiveness and heavy strength are distinguishing features of this  mosque. Even the octagonal basin and its protecting cupola that stands  in the middle of the court lack the charm that belongs to so many of the  fountains of Cairo. There are two minarets, the minaret of the bird, and  a larger one, approached by a big stairway up which, so my dragoman  told me, a Sultan whose name I have forgotten loved to ride his favorite  horse. Upon the summit of this minaret I stood for a long time, looking  down over the city.    Grey it was that morning, almost as London is grey; but the sounds that  came up softly to my ears out of the mist were not the sounds of  London. Those many minarets, almost like columns of fog rising above the  cupolas, spoke to me of the East even upon this sad and sunless morning.  Once from where I was standing at the time appointed went forth the  call to prayer, and in the barren court beneath me there were crowds  of ardent worshippers. Stern men paced upon the huge terrace just at my  feet fingering their heads, and under that heavy cupola were made the  long ablutions of the faithful. But now no man comes to this old place,  no murmur to God disturbs the heavy silence. And the silence, and the  emptiness, and the greyness under the long arcades, all seem to make  a tremulous proclamation; all seem to whisper, \"I am very old, I am  useless, I cumber the earth.\" Even the mosque of Amru, which stands also  on ground that looks gone to waste, near dingy and squat houses built  with grey bricks, seems less old than this mosque of Ibn-Tulun. For  its long facade is striped with white and apricot, and there are  lebbek-trees growing in its court near the two columns between which  if you can pass you are assured of heaven. But the mosque of Ibn-Tulun,  seen upon a sad day, makes a powerful impression, and from the summit of  its minaret you are summoned by the many minarets of Cairo to make the  pilgrimage of the mosques, to pass from the \"broken arches\" of these  Saracenic cloisters to the \"Blue Mosque,\" the \"Red Mosque,\" the mosques  of Mohammed Ali, of Sultan Hassan, of Kait Bey, of El-Azhar, and so on  to the Coptic church that is the silent centre of \"old Cairo.\" It is  said that there are over four hundred mosques in Cairo. As I looked  down from the minaret of Ibn-Tulun, they called me through the mist  that blotted completely out all the surrounding country, as if it would  concentrate my attention upon the places of prayer during these holy  days when the pilgrims were crowding in to depart with the Holy Carpet.  And I went down by the staircase of the house, and in the mist I made my  pilgrimage.    As every one who visits Rome goes to St. Peter's, so every one who  visits Cairo goes to the mosque of Mohammed Ali in the citadel, a  gorgeous building in a magnificent situation, the interior of which  always makes me think of Court functions, and of the pomp of life,  rather than of prayer and self-denial. More attractive to me is the  \"Blue Mosque,\" to which I returned again and again, enticed almost as by  the fascination of the living blue of a summer day.    This mosque, which is the mosque of Ibrahim Aga, but which is familiarly  known to its lovers as the \"Blue Mosque,\" lies to the left of a  ramshackle street, and from the outside does not look specially  inviting. Even when I passed through its door, and stood in the court  beyond, at first I felt not its charm. All looked old and rough, unkempt  and in confusion. The red and white stripes of the walls and the arches  of the arcade, the mean little place for ablution--a pipe and a row of  brass taps--led the mind from a Neapolitan ice to a second-rate school,  and for a moment I thought of abruptly retiring and seeking more  splendid precincts. And then I looked across the court to the arcade  that lay beyond, and I saw the exquisite \"love-color\" of the marvellous  tiles that gives this mosque its name.    The huge pillars of this arcade are striped and ugly, but between them  shone, with an ineffable lustre, a wall of purple and blue, of purple  and blue so strong and yet so delicate that it held the eyes and drew  the body forward. If ever color calls, it calls in the blue mosque of  Ibrahim Aga. And when I had crossed the court, when I stood beside the  pulpit, with its delicious, wooden folding-doors, and studied the tiles  of which this wonderful wall is composed, I found them as lovely near as  they are lovely far off. From a distance they resemble a Nature effect,  are almost like a bit of Southern sea or of sky, a fragment of gleaming  Mediterranean seen through the pillars of a loggia, or of Sicilian blue  watching over Etna in the long summer days. When one is close to them,  they are a miracle of art. The background of them is a milky white upon  which is an elaborate pattern of purple and blue, generally conventional  and representative of no known object, but occasionally showing tall  trees somewhat resembling cypresses. But it is impossible in words  adequately to describe the effect of these tiles, and of the tiles that  line to the very roof the tomb-house on the right of the court. They  are like a cry of ecstasy going up in this otherwise not very beautiful  mosque; they make it unforgettable, they draw you back to it again and  yet again. On the darkest day of winter they set something of summer  there. In the saddest moment they proclaim the fact that there is joy  in the world, that there was joy in the hearts of creative artists years  upon years ago. If you are ever in Cairo, and sink into depression, go  to the \"Blue Mosque\" and see if it does not have upon you an uplifting  moral effect. And then, if you like go on from it to the Gamia El  Movayad, sometimes called El Ahmar, \"The Red,\" where you will find  greater glories, though no greater fascination; for the tiles hold their  own among all the wonders of Cairo.    Outside the \"Red Mosque,\" by its imposing and lofty wall, there is  always an assemblage of people, for prayers go up in this mosque,  ablutions are made there, and the floor of the arcade is often  covered with men studying the Koran, calmly meditating, or prostrating  themselves in prayer. And so there is a great coming and going up the  outside stairs and through the wonderful doorway: beggars crouch  under the wall of the terrace; the sellers of cakes, of syrups and  lemon-water, and of the big and luscious watermelons that are so  popular in Cairo, display their wares beneath awnings of orange-colored  sackcloth, or in the full glare of the sun, and, their prayers  comfortably completed or perhaps not yet begun, the worshippers stand to  gossip, or sit to smoke their pipes, before going on their way into the  city or the mosque. There are noise and perpetual movement here. Stand  for a while to gain an impression from them before you mount the steps  and pass into the spacious peace beyond.    Orientals must surely revel in contrasts. There is no tumult like the  tumult in certain of their"]]]
