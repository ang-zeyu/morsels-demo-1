So thinking, they put themselves into communication with Bennett and  Claiborne. In 1654 Stone charged the Commissioners with having promoted  \"faction, sedition, and rebellion against the Lord Baltimore.\" The  charge was well founded. Claiborne and Bennett assumed that they were  yet Parliament Commissioners, empowered to bring \"all plantations within  the Bay of Chesapeake to their due obedience to the Parliament and  Commonwealth of England.\" And they were indeed set against the Lord  Baltimore. Claiborne would head the Puritans of Providence; and a troop  should be raised in Virginia and march northward. The Commissioners  actually advanced upon St. Mary's, and with so superior a force that  Stone surrendered, and a Puritan Government was inaugurated. A Puritan  Assembly met, debarring any Catholics. Presently it passed an act  annulling the Proprietary's Act of Toleration. Professors of the  religion of Rome should \"be restrained from the exercise thereof.\"  The hand of the law was to fall heavily upon \"popery, prelacy, or  licentiousness of opinion.\" Thus was intolerance alive again in the only  land where she had seemed to die!    In England now there was hardly a Parliament, but only the Lord  Protector, Oliver Cromwell. Content with Baltimore's recognition of the  Protectorate, Cromwell was not prepared to back, in their independent  action, the Commissioners of that now dissolved Parliament. Baltimore  made sure of this, and then dispatched messengers overseas to Stone,  bidding him do all that lay in him to retake Maryland. Stone thereupon  gathered several hundred men and a fleet of small sailing craft, with  which he pushed up the bay to the Severn. In the meantime the Puritans  had not been idle, but had themselves raised a body of men and had taken  over the Golden Lyon, an armed merchantman lying before their town. On  the 24th of March, 1655, the two forces met in the Battle of the Severn.  \"In the name of God, fall on!\" cried the men of Providence, and \"Hey for  St. Mary's!\" cried the others. The battle was won by the Providence men.  They slew or wounded fifty of the St. Mary's men and desperately wounded  Stone himself and took many prisoners, ten of whom were afterwards  condemned to death and four were actually executed.    Now followed a period of up and down, the Commissioners and the  Proprietary alike appealing to the Lord Protector for some expression of  his \"determinate will.\" Both sides received encouragement inasmuch as he  decided for neither. His own authority being denied by neither, Cromwell  may have preferred to hold these distant factions in a canceling,  neutralizing posture. But far weightier matters, in fact, were occupying  his mind. In 1657, weary of her \"very sad, distracted, and unsettled  condition,\" Maryland herself proceeded--Puritan, Prelatist, and  Catholic together--to agree henceforth to disagree. Toleration viewed  in retrospect appears dimly to have been seen for the angel that it was.  Maryland would return to the Proprietary's rule, provided there should  be complete indemnity for political offenses and a solemn promise that  the Toleration Act of 1649 should never be repealed. This without a  smile Baltimore promised. Articles were signed; a new Assembly composed  of all manner of Christians was called; and Maryland returned for a time  to her first allegiance.    Quiet years, on the whole, follow in Virginia under the Commonwealth.  The three Governors of this period--Bennett, Digges, and Mathews are  all chosen by the Assembly, which, but for the Navigation Laws,* might  almost forget the Home Government. Then Oliver Cromwell dies; and, after  an interval, back to England come the Stuarts. Charles II is proclaimed  King. And back into office in Virginia is brought that staunch old  monarchist, Sir William Berkeley--first by a royalist Assembly and  presently by commission from the new King.         * See Editor's Note on the Navigation Laws at the end of       this volume.      Then Virginia had her Long Parliament or Assembly. In 1661, in the  first gush of the Restoration, there was elected a House of Burgesses so  congenial to Berkeley's mind that he wished to see it perpetuated. For  fifteen years therefore he held it in being, with adjournments from one  year into another and with sharp refusals to listen to any demand for  new elections. Yet this demand grew, and still the Governor shut the  door in the face of the people and looked imperiously forth from the  window. His temper, always fiery, now burned vindictive; his zeal for  King and Church and the high prerogatives of the Governor of Virginia  became a consuming passion.    When Berkeley first came to Virginia, and again for a moment in the  flare of the Restoration, his popularity had been real, but for long now  it had dwindled. He belonged to an earlier time, and he held fast to old  ideas that were decaying at the heart. A bigot for the royal power,  a man of class with a contempt for the generality and its clumsily  expressed needs, he grew in narrowness as he grew in years. Berkeley  could in these later times write home, though with some exaggeration:  \"I thank God there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope we shall  not have these hundred years; for learning has brought disobedience into  the world and printing has divulged them, and libels against the best  governments! God keep us from both!\" But that was the soured zealot  for absolutism--William Berkeley the man was fond enough of books and  himself had written plays.    The spirit of the time was reactionary in Virginia as it was reactionary  in England. Harsh servant and slave laws were passed. A prison was to  be erected in each county; provision was made for pillory and stocks and  duckingstool; the Quakers were to be proceeded against; the Baptists  who refused to bring children to baptism were to suffer. Then at last in  1670 came restriction of the franchise:    \"Act III. ELECTION OF BURGESSES BY WHOM. WHEREAS the usuall way of  chuseing burgesses by the votes of all persons who having served their  tyme are freemen of this country who haveing little interest in the  country doe oftener make tumults at the election to the disturbance of  his Majestie's peace, than by their discretions in their votes provide  for the conservation thereof, by makeing choyce of persons fitly  qualifyed for the discharge of soe greate a trust, And whereas the  lawes of England grant a voyce in such election only to such as by  their estates real or personall have interest enough to tye them to  the endeavour of the publique good; IT IS HEREBY ENACTED, that none but  freeholders and housekeepers who only are answerable to the publique for  the levies shall hereafter have a voice in the election of any burgesses  in this country.\"         *Hening's \"Statutes\", vol. II, p. 280.      Three years later another woe befell the colony. That same Charles  II--to whom in misfortune Virginia had so adhered that for her loyalty  she had received the name of the Old Dominion--now granted \"all that  entire tract, territory, region, and dominion of land and water commonly  called Virginia, together with the territory of Accomack,\" to Lord  Culpeper and the Earl of Arlington. For thirty-one years they were to  hold it, paying to the King the slight annual rent of forty shillings.  They were not to disturb the colonists in any guaranteed right of life  or land or goods, but for the rest they might farm Virginia. The country  cried out in anger. The Assembly hurried commissioners on board a ship  in port and sent them to England to besiege the ear of the King.    Distress and discontent increased, with good reason, among the mass of  the Virginians. The King in England, his councilors, and Parliament,  played an unfatherly role, while in Virginia economic hardships pressed  ever harder and the administration became more and more oppressive.  By 1676 the gunpowder of popular indignation was laid right and left,  awaiting the match.        CHAPTER XII. NATHANIEL BACON    To add to the uncertainty of life in Virginia, Indian troubles flared up  again. In and around the main settlements the white man was safe enough  from savage attack. But it was not so on the edge of the English world,  where the white hue ran thin, where small clusters of folk and even  single families built cabins of logs and made lonely clearings in the  wilderness.    Not far from where now rises Washington the Susquehannocks had taken  possession of an old fort. These Indians, once in league with the  Iroquois but now quarreling violently with that confederacy, had  been defeated and were in a mood of undiscriminating bitterness and  vengeance. They began to waylay and butcher white men and women and  children. In self protection Maryland and Virginia organized in common  an expedition against the Indian stronghold. In the deep woods beyond  the Potomac, red men and white came to a parley. The Susquehannocks sent  envoys. There was wrong on both sides. A dispute arose. The white men,  waxing angry, slew the envoys--an evil deed which their own color in  Maryland and in Virginia reprehended and repudiated. But the harm  was done. From the Potomac to the James Indians listened to Indian  eloquence, reciting the evils that from the first the white man had  brought. Then the red man, in increasing numbers, fell upon the outlying  settlements of the pioneers.    In Virginia there soon arose a popular clamor for effective action. Call  out the militia of every county! March against the Indians! Act! But the  Governor was old, of an ill temper now, and most suspicious of popular  gatherings for any purpose whatsoever. He temporized, delayed, refused  all appeals until the Assembly should meet.

But by 1869. the Pony Express was quietly  superseded by the telegraph, which in that year had completed its  circuits all the way to San Francisco, seven years ahead of the first  transcontinental railroad. And in four more years Cyrus W. Field and  Peter Cooper had carried to complete success the Atlantic Cable; and the  Morse telegraph was sending intelligence across the sea, as well as from  New York to the Golden Gate.    And today ships at sea and stations on land, separated by the sea, speak  to one another in the language of the Morse Code, without the use  of wires. Wireless, or radio, telegraphy was the invention of a  nineteen-year-old boy, Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian; but it has  been greatly extended and developed at the hands of four Americans:  Fessenden, Alexanderson, Langmuir, and Lee De Forest. It was De  Forest's invention that made possible transcontinental and transatlantic  telephone service, both with and without wires.    The story of the telegraph's younger brother, and great ally in  communication, the telephone of Alexander Graham Bell, is another  pregnant romance of American invention. But that is a story by itself,  and it begins in a later period and so falls within the scope of another  volume of these Chronicles.*         * \"The Age of Big Business\", by Burton J. Hendrick, \"The       Chronicle of America\", vol. XXXIX.      Wise newspapermen stiffened to attention when the telegraph began  ticking. The New York Herald, the Sun, and the Tribune had been founded  only recently and they represented a new type of journalism, swift,  fearless, and energetic. The proprietors of these newspapers saw that  this new instrument was bound to affect all newspaperdom profoundly. How  was the newspaper to cope with the situation and make use of the news  that was coming in and would be coming in more and more over the wires?    For one thing, the newspapers needed better printing machinery. The  application of steam, or any mechanical power, to printing in America  was only begun. It had been introduced by Robert Hoe in the very years  when Morse was struggling to perfect the telegraph. Before that time  newspapers were printed in the United States, on presses operated as  Franklin's press had been operated, by hand. The New York Sun, the  pioneer of cheap modern newspapers, was printed by hand in 1833, and  four hundred impressions an hour was the highest speed of one press.  There had been, it is true, some improvements over Franklin's printing  press. The Columbian press of George Clymer of Philadelphia, invented  in 1816, was a step forward. The Washington press, patented in 1829 by  Samuel Rust of New York, was another step forward. Then had come Robert  Hoe's double-cylinder, steamdriven printing press. But a swifter machine  was wanted. And so in 1845 Richard March Hoe, a son of Robert Hoe,  invented the revolving or rotary press, on the principle of which larger  and larger machines have been built--machines so complex and wonderful  that they baffle description; which take in reels of white paper and  turn out great newspapers complete, folded and counted, at the rate of  a hundred thousand copies an hour. American printing machines are in use  today the world over. The London Times is printed on American machines.    Hundreds of new inventions and improvements on old inventions followed  hard on the growth of the newspaper, until it seemed that the last word  had been spoken. The newspapers had the wonderful Hoe presses; they  had cheap paper; they had excellent type, cast by machinery; they had a  satisfactory process of multiplying forms of type by stereotyping; and  at length came a new process of making pictures by photo-engraving,  supplanting the old-fashioned process of engraving on wood. Meanwhile,  however, in one important department of the work, the newspapers had  made no advance whatever. The newspapers of New York in the year 1885,  and later, set up their type by the same method that Benjamin Franklin  used to set up the type for The Pennsylvania Gazette. The compositor  stood or sat at his \"case,\" with his \"copy\" before him, and picked the  type up letter by letter until he had filled and correctly spaced a  line. Then he would set another line, and so on, all with his hands.  After the job was completed, the type had to be distributed again,  letter by letter. Typesetting was slow and expensive.    This labor of typesetting was at last generally done away with by the  invention of two intricate and ingenious machines. The linotype, the  invention of Ottmar Mergenthaler of Baltimore, came first; then the  monotype of Tolbert Lanston, a native of Ohio. The linotype is the  favorite composing machine for newspapers and is also widely used  in typesetting for books, though the monotype is preferred by book  printers. One or other of these machines has today replaced, for  the most part, the old hand compositors in every large printing  establishment in the United States.      While the machinery of the great newspapers was being developed, another  instrument of communication, more humble but hardly less important in  modern life, was coming into existence. The typewriter is today in every  business office and is another of America's gifts to the commercial  world. One might attempt to trace the typewriter back to the early  seals, or to the name plates of the Middle Ages, or to the records  of the British Patent Office, for 1714, which mention a machine for  embossing. But it would be difficult to establish the identity of these  contrivances with the modern typewriter.    Two American devices, one of William Burt in 1829, for a \"typographer,\"  and another of Charles Thurber, of Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1843,  may also be passed over. Alfred Ely Beach made a model for a typewriter  as early as 1847, but neglected it for other things, and his next effort  in printing machines was a device for embossing letters for the blind.  His typewriter had many of the features of the modern typewriter, but  lacked a satisfactory method of inking the types. This was furnished  by S. W. Francis of New York, whose machine, in 1857, bore a ribbon  saturated with ink. None of these machines, however, was a commercial  success. They were regarded merely as the toys of ingenious men.    The accredited father of the typewriter was a Wisconsin newspaperman,  Christopher Latham Sholes, editor, politician, and anti-slavery  agitator. A strike of his printers led him to unsuccessful attempts to  invent a typesetting machine. He did succeed, however, in making,  in collaboration with another printer, Samuel W. Soule, a numbering  machine, and a friend, Carlos Glidden, to whom this ingenious  contrivance was shown, suggested a machine to print letters.    The three friends decided to try. None had studied the efforts of  previous experimenters, and they made many errors which might have  been avoided. Gradually, however, the invention took form. Patents were  obtained in June, 1868, and again in July of the same year, but the  machine was neither strong nor trustworthy. Now appeared James Densmore  and bought a share in the machine, while Soule and Glidden retired.  Densmore furnished the funds to build about thirty models in succession,  each a little better than the preceding. The improved machine was  patented in 1871, and the partners felt that they were ready to begin  manufacturing.    Wisely they determined, in 1873, to offer their machine to Eliphalet  Remington and Sons, then manufacturing firearms, sewing machines, and  the like, at Ilion, New York. Here, in well-equipped machine shops it  was tested, strengthened, and improved. The Remingtons believed they saw  a demand for the machine and offered to buy the patents, paying either a  lump sum, or a royalty. It is said that Sholes preferred the ready cash  and received twelve thousand dollars, while Densmore chose the royalty  and received a million and a half.      The telegraph, the press, and the typewriter are agents of communication  for the written word. The telephone is an agent for the spoken word.  And there is another instrument for recording sound and reproducing it,  which should not be forgotten. It was in 1877 that Thomas Alva Edison  completed the first phonograph. The air vibrations set up by the human  voice were utilized to make minute indentations on a sheet of tinfoil  placed over a metallic cylinder, and the machine would then reproduce  the sounds which had caused the indentations. The record wore out after  a few reproductions, however, and Edison was too busy to develop his  idea further for a time, though later he returned to it.    The phonograph today appears under various names, but by whatever name  they are called, the best machines reproduce with wonderful fidelity  the human voice, in speech or song, and the tones of either a single  instrument or a whole orchestra. The most distinguished musicians are  glad to do their best for the preservation and reproduction of their  art, and through these machines, good music is brought to thousands to  whom it could come in no other way.      The camera bears a large part in the diffusion of intelligence, and the  last half century in the United States has seen a great development in  photography and photoengraving. The earliest experiments in photography  belong almost exclusively to Europe. Morse, as we have seen, introduced  the secret to America and interested his friend John W. Draper, who had  a part in the perfection of the dry plate and who was one of the first,  if not the first, to take a portrait by photography.    The world's greatest inventor in photography is, however, George  Eastman, of Rochester. It was in 1888 that Eastman introduced a new  camera, which he called by the distinctive name Kodak, and with it the  slogan: \"You press the button, we do the rest.\" This first kodak  was "]]]
