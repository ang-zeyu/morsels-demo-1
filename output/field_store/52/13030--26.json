The continuous weird whistle from  the hidden mechanism of the sun-ship was like the drone of a monster  insect, monotonous and soporific during the long intervals when the  scientist was too busy with his controls to engage in conversation.    For some reason that he could not explain, Northwood had an aversion to  going into the sleeping apartment behind the control room. Then, towards  morning, when the suddenly falling temperature struck a biting chill  throughout the sun-ship, Northwood, going into the cabin for fur coats,  discovered why his mind and body shrank in horror from the cabin.           *       *       *       *       *    After he had procured the fur coats from a closet, he paused a moment,  in the privacy of the cabin, to look at Athalia's picture. Every nerve  in his body leaped to meet the magnetism of her beautiful eyes. Never  had Mary Burns stirred emotion like this in him. He hung over Mary's  picture, wistfully, hoping almost prayerfully that he could react to her  as he did to Athalia; but her pale, over-intellectual face left him  cold.    \"Cad!\" he ground out between his teeth. \"Forgetting her so soon!\"    The two pictures were lying side by side on a little table. Suddenly an  obscure noise in the room caught his attention. It was more vibration  than noise, for small sounds could scarcely be heard above the whistle  of the sun-ship. A slight compression of the air against his neck gave  him the eery feeling that someone was standing close behind him. He  wheeled and looked over his shoulder. Half ashamed of his startled  gesture, he again turned to his pictures. Then a sharp cry broke from  him.    Athalia's picture was gone.    He searched for it everywhere in the room, in his own pockets, under the  furniture. It was nowhere to be found.    In sudden, overpowering horror, he seized the fur coats and returned to  the control room.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Mundson was changing the speed.    \"Look out the window!\" he called to Northwood.    The young man looked and started violently. Day had come, and now that  the sun-ship was flying at a moderate speed, the ocean beneath was  plainly visible; and its entire surface was covered with broken floes of  ice and small, ragged icebergs. He seized a telescope and focused it  below. A typical polar scene met his eyes: penguins strutted about on  cakes of ice, a whale blowing in the icy water.    \"A part of the Antarctic that has never been explored,\" said Dr.  Mundson; \"and there, just showing on the horizon, is the Great Ice  Barrier.\" His characteristic smile lighted the morose black eyes. \"I am  enough of the dramatist to wish you to be impressed with what I shall  show you within less than an hour. Accordingly, I shall make a landing  and let you feel polar ice under your feet.\"    After less than a minute's search, Dr. Mundson found a suitable place on  the ice for a landing, and, with a few deft manipulations of the  controls, brought the sun-ship swooping down like an eagle on its prey.    For a long moment after the scientist had stepped out on the ice,  Northwood paused at the door. His feet were chained by a strange  reluctance to enter this white, dead wilderness of ice. But Dr.  Mundson's impatient, \"Ready?\" drew from him one last glance at the cozy  interior of the sun-ship before he, too, went out into the frozen  stillness.    They left the sun-ship resting on the ice like a fallen silver moon,  while they wandered to the edge of the Barrier and looked at the gray,  narrow stretch of sea between the ice pack and the high cliffs of the  Barrier. The sun of the commencing six-months' Antarctic day was a low,  cold ball whose slanted rays struck the ice with blinding whiteness.  There were constant falls of ice from the Barrier, which thundered into  the ocean amid great clouds of ice smoke that lingered like wraiths  around the edge. It was a scene of loneliness and waiting death.    \"What's that?\" exclaimed the scientist suddenly.    Out of the white silence shrilled a low whistle, a familiar whistle.  Both men wheeled toward the sun-ship.    Before their horrified eyes, the great sphere jerked and glided up, and  swerved into the heavens.           *       *       *       *       *    Up it soared; then, gaining speed, it swung into the blue distance  until, in a moment, it was a tiny star that flickered out even as they  watched.    Both men screamed and cursed and flung up their arms despairingly. A  penguin, attracted by their cries, waddled solemnly over to them and  regarded them with manlike curiosity.    \"Stranded in the coldest spot on earth!\" groaned the scientist.    \"Why did it start itself, Dr. Mundson!\" Northwood narrowed his eyes as  he spoke.    \"It didn't!\" The scientist's huge face, red from cold, quivered with  helpless rage. \"Human hands started it.\"    \"What! Whose hands?\"    \"_Ach!_ Do I know?\" His Teutonic accent grew more pronounced, as it  always did when he was under emotional stress. \"Somebody whose brain is  better than mine. Somebody who found a way to hide away from our eyes.  _Ach, Gott!_ Don't let me think!\"    His great head sank between his shoulders, giving him, in his fur suit,  the grotesque appearance of a friendly brown bear.    \"Doctor Mundson,\" said Northwood suddenly, \"did you have an enemy, a man  with the face and body of a pagan god--a great, blond creature with eyes  as cold and cruel as the ice under our feet?\"    \"Wait!\" The huge round head jerked up. \"How do you know about Adam? You  have not seen him, won't see him until we arrive at our destination.\"    \"But I have seen him. He was sitting not thirty feet from you in the Mad  Hatter's Club last night. Didn't you know? He followed me to the street,  spoke to me, and then--\" Northwood stopped. How could he let the insane  words pass his lips?    \"Then, what? Speak up!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Northwood laughed nervously. \"It sounds foolish, but I saw him vanish  like that.\" He snapped his fingers.    \"_Ach, Gott!_\" All the ruddy color drained from the scientist's face. As  though talking to himself, he continued:    \"Then it is true, as he said. He has crossed the bridge. He has reached  the Light. And now he comes to see the world he will conquer--came  unseen when I refused my permission.\"    He was silent for a long time, pondering. Then he turned passionately to  Northwood.    \"John Northwood, kill me! I have brought a new horror into the world.  From the unborn future, I have snatched a creature who has reached the  Light too soon. Kill me!\" He bowed his great, shaggy head.    \"What do you mean, Dr. Mundson: that this Adam has arrived at a point in  evolution beyond this age?\"    \"Yes. Think of it! I visioned godlike creatures with the souls of gods.  But, Heaven help us, man always will be man: always will lust for  conquest. You and I, Northwood, and all others are barbarians to Adam.  He and his kind will do what men always do to barbarians--conquer and  kill.\"    \"Are there more like him?\" Northwood struggled with a smile of unbelief.    \"I don't know. I did not know that Adam had reached a point so near the  ultimate. But you have seen. Already he is able to set aside what we  call natural laws.\"    Northwood looked at the scientist closely. The man was surely mad--mad  in this desert of white death.    \"Come!\" he said cheerfully. \"Let's build an Eskimo snow house. We can  live on penguins for days. And who knows what may rescue us?\"    For three hours the two worked at cutting ice blocks. With snow for  mortar, they built a crude shelter which enabled them to rest out of the  cold breath of the spiral polar winds that blew from the south.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Mundson was sitting at the door of their hut, moodily pulling at his  strong, black pipe. As though a fit had seized him, he leaped up and let  his pipe fall to the ice.    \"Look!\" he shouted. \"The sun-ship!\"    It seemed but a moment before the tiny speck on the horizon had swept  overhead, a silver comet on the grayish-blue polar sky. In another  moment it had swooped down, eaglewise, scarcely fifty feet from the ice  hut.    Dr. Mundson and Northwood ran forward. From the metal sphere stepped the  stranger of the Mad Hatter Club. His tall, straight form, erect and  slim, swung toward them over the ice.    \"Adam!\" shouted Dr. Mundson. \"What does this mean? How dare you!\"    Adam's laugh was like the happy demonstration of a boy. \"So? You think  you still are master? You think I returned because I reverenced you  yet?\" Hate shot viciously through the freezing blue eyes. \"You worm of  the Black Age!\"    Northwood shuddered. He had heard those strange words addressed to  himself scarcely more than twelve hours ago.    Adam was still speaking: \"With a thought I could annihilate you where  you are standing. But I have use for you. Get in.\" He swept his hand to  the sun-ship.    Both men hesitated. Then Northwood strode forward until he was within  three feet of Adam. They stood thus, eyeing each other, two splendid  beings, one blond as a Viking, the other dark and vital.    \"Just what is your game?\" demanded Northwood.    The icy eyes shot forth a gleam like lightning. \"I needn't tell you, of  course, but I may as well let you suffer over the knowledge.\" He curled  his lips with superb scorn. \"I have one human weakness. I want Athalia.\"  The icy eyes warmed for a fleeting second. \"She is anticipating her  meeting with you--bah! The taste of these women of the Black Age! I  could kill you, of course; but that would only inflame her. And so I  take you to her, thrust you down her throat. When she sees you, she will  fly to me.\" He spread his magnificent chest.    \"Adam!\" Dr. Mundson's face was dark with anger. \"What of Eve?\"    \"Who are you to question my actions? What a fool you were to let me,  whom you forced into life thousands of years too soon, grow more  powerful than you!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28681"],[0,"The Cook's Oracle; and Housekeeper's Manual (#19)"],[1,"  turnips, &c.: they will take about four hours: let them stand till cold,  to skim off the fat; then warm it up all together, or part, as you may  want it.    \"All these I have been in the habit of baking for the first families.    \"The time each of the above articles should take depends much upon the  state of the oven, and I do consider the baker a sufficient judge; if  they are sent to him in time, he must be very neglectful if they are not  ready at the time they are ordered.\"    For receipts for making bread, French rolls, muffins, crumpets, Sally  Lunn, &c., see the Appendix.      FOOTNOTES:    [66-*] \"The process by which food is most commonly prepared for the  table, BOILING, is so familiar to every one, and its effects are so  uniform, and apparently so simple, that few, I believe, have taken the  trouble to inquire _how_ or _in what manner_ those effects are produced;  and whether any, and what improvements in that branch of cookery are  possible. So little has this matter been an object of inquiry, that few,  very few indeed, I believe, among the _millions of persons_ who for so  many ages have been _daily_ employed in this process, have ever given  themselves the trouble to bestow one serious thought on the subject.    \"_Boiling_ cannot be carried on without a very great expense of fuel;  but any boiling-hot liquid (by using proper means for confining the  heat) may be kept _boiling-hot_ for any length of time almost without  any expense of fuel at all.    \"_The waste of fuel_ in culinary processes, which arises from making  liquids boil _unnecessarily_, or when nothing more would be necessary  than to keep them _boiling-hot_, is enormous; I have not a doubt but  that much more than half the fuel used in all the kitchens, public and  private, in the whole world, is wasted precisely in this manner.    \"But the evil does not stop here. This unscientific and slovenly manner  of cooking renders the process much more laborious and troublesome than  otherwise it would be; and, (what by many will be considered of more  importance than either the waste of fuel or the increase of labour to  the cook) the food is rendered less savoury, and very probably less  nourishing and less wholesome.    \"It is natural to suppose that many of the finer and more volatile  parts of food (those which are best calculated to act on the organs  of taste), must be carried off with the steam when the boiling is  violent.\"--_Count_ RUMFORD'S 10th Essay, pp. 3, 6.    [67-*] If, unfortunately, this should happen, the cook must carefully  take it off when she dishes up, either with a clean sponge or a  paste-brush.    [67-+] Cooks, however, as well as doctors, disagree; for some say, that  \"all sorts of fresh meat should be put in when the water boils.\" I  prefer the above method for the reason given; gentle stewing renders  meat, &c. tender, and still leaves it sapid and nutritive.    [71-*] The diminution of weight by boiling and roasting is not all lost,  the FAT SKIMMINGS and the DRIPPINGS, nicely clarified, will well supply  the place of lard and for frying. See No. 83, and the receipt for CHEAP  SOUP (No. 229).          CHAPTER II.    ROASTING.      In all studies, it is the best practice to begin with the plainest and  easiest parts; and so on, by degrees, to such as are more difficult: we,  therefore, treated of plain boiling, and we now proceed to roasting: we  shall then gradually unravel to our culinary students the art (and  _mystery_, until developed in this work) of making, with the least  trouble and expense, the most highly finished soups, sauces, and  made-dishes.    Let the young cook never forget that cleanliness is the chief cardinal  virtue of the kitchen; the first preparation for roasting is to take  care that the spit be properly cleaned with sand and water; nothing  else. When it has been well scoured with this, dry it with a clean  cloth. If spits are wiped clean as soon as the meat is drawn from them,  and while they are hot, a very little cleaning will be required. The  less the spit is passed through the meat the better;[74-*] and, before  you spit it, joint it properly, especially necks and loins, that the  carver may separate them easily and neatly, and take especial care it be  evenly balanced on the spit, that its motion may be regular, and the  fire operate equally on each part of it; therefore, be provided with  balancing-skewers and cookholds, and see it is properly jointed.    Roasting should be done by the radiant heat of a clear, glowing fire,  otherwise it is in fact _baked_: the machines the economical  grate-makers call ROASTERS, are, in plain English, ovens.    Count Rumford was certainly an exact economist of fuel, when he  contrived these things; and those philosophers who try all questions  \"according to Cocker\" may vote for baked victuals; but the rational  epicure, who has been accustomed to enjoy beef well roasted, will soon  be convinced that the poet who wrote our national ballad at the end of  this chapter, was not inspired by Sir Benjamin Thompson's cookery.    All your attention in roasting will be thrown away, if you do not take  care that your meat, especially beef, has been kept long enough to be  tender. See \"ADVICE TO COOKS,\" and obs. to No. 68.    Make up the fire in time; let it be proportioned to the dinner to be  dressed, and about three or four inches longer at each end than the  thing to be roasted, or the ends of the meat cannot be done nice and  brown.    A cook must be as particular to proportion her fire to the business she  has to do, as a chemist: the degree of heat most desirable for dressing  the different sorts of food ought to be attended to with the utmost  precision.    The fire that is but just sufficient to receive the noble sirloin (No.  19), will parch up a lighter joint.    From half an hour to an hour before you begin to roast, prepare the fire  by putting a few coals on, which will be sufficiently lighted by the  time you wish to make use of your fire; between the bars, and on the  top, put small or large coals, according to the bulk of the joint, and  the time the fire is required to be strong; after which, throw the  cinders (wetted) at the back.    Never put meat down to a burned-up fire, if you can possibly avoid it;  but should the fire become fierce, place the spit at a considerable  distance, and allow a little more time.    Preserve the fat,[75-*] by covering it with paper, for this purpose  called \"kitchen-paper,\" and tie it on with fine twine; pins and skewers  can by no means be allowed; they are so many taps to let out the gravy:  besides, the paper often starts from them and catches fire, to the great  injury of the meat.    If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, the fire should be little  and brisk: when you have a large joint to roast, make up a sound, strong  fire, equally good in every part of the grate, or your meat cannot be  equally roasted, nor have that uniform colour which constitutes the  beauty of good roasting.    Give the fire a good stirring before you lay the joint down; examine it  from time to time while the spit is going round; keep it clear at the  bottom, and take care there are no smoky coals in the front, which will  spoil the look and taste of the meat, and hinder it from roasting  evenly.    When the joint to be roasted is thicker at one end than the other, place  the spit slanting, with the thickest part nearest the fire.    Do not put meat too near the fire at first; the larger the joint, the  farther it must be kept from the fire: if once it gets scorched, the  outside will become hard, and acquire a disagreeable, empyreumatic  taste; and the fire being prevented from penetrating into it, the meat  will appear done before it is little more than half-done, besides losing  the pale brown colour, which it is the beauty of roasted meat to have.    From 14 to 10 inches is the usual distance at which meat is put from the  grate, when first put down. It is extremely difficult to offer any thing  like an accurate general rule for this, it depends so much upon the size  of the fire, and of that of the thing to be roasted.    Till some culinary philosopher shall invent a thermometer to ascertain  the heat of the fire, and a graduated spit-rack to regulate the distance  from it, the process of roasting is attended by so many ever-varying  circumstances, that it must remain among those which can only be  performed well, by frequent practice and attentive observation.    If you wish your jack to go well, keep it as clean as possible, oil it,  and then wipe it: if the oil is not wiped off again it will gather dust;  to prevent this, as soon as you have done roasting, cover it up. Never  leave the winders on while the jack is going round, unless you do it, as  Swift says, \"that it may fly off, and knock those troublesome servants  on the head who will be crowding round your kitchen fire.\"    Be very careful to place the dripping-pan at such a distance from the  fire as just to catch the drippings: if it is too near, the ashes will  fall into it, and spoil the drippings[76-*] (which we shall hereafter  show will occasionally be found an excellent substitute for butter or  lard). To clarify drippings, see (No. 83,) and pease and dripping soup  (No. 229), savoury and salubrious, for only a penny per quart. If it is  too far from the fire to catch them, you will not only lose your  drippings, but the meat will be blackened and spoiled by the foetid  smoke, which will arise when the fat falls on the live cinders.    A large dripping-pan is convenient for several purposes. It should not  be less than 28 inches long and 20 inches wide, and have a covered well  on the side from the fire, to collect the drippings; this will preserve  them in the most delicate state: in a pan of the above size you may set  fried fish, and various dishes, to keep hot.    This is one of Painter's and Hawke's contrivances, near Norfolk-street,"]]]
