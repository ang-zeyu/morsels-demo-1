Cover all over with fine dirt the same as it was before being  disturbed. Then take a brush made from stiff tough grass, a small  brush or the wing of a chicken or sage-hen and brush out all finger  marks, etc., then drop the last bait on top of stake and go away.\"    \"The coyote or wolf will not come close enough to get caught the  first three or four nights, but don't get uneasy, they will get bold  after awhile, if you don't go too close to your trap when looking at  it. When one gets caught in a trap set this way, he pulls to the end  of the chain and swings around so as to step into another trap, then  there is not much danger of him breaking a chain or pulling up a  stake.\"      * * *    \"In trapping the coyote or wolf, I make a bed some three or four feet  each way, or nearly round. I set the traps after I swing the spring  to the \"dog\" side. Then place the trap, say, about ten inches from  the outside of the bed. Cover them with about three-fourths inch of  soil. I cover the pan with a piece of gunny sack so the sack will be  inside of the jaws. I place the pin in the middle of the  bed,--everything is covered.\"    \"I use bacon for my bait. After I have the bed all smooth and fine, I  cut the bacon in very small pieces, then scatter them all over the  bed, say some four inches apart. Coyotes like the bacon. They  commence to pick up the small pieces and the first thing they know  they are in trouble. I caught in two nights with the eight sets six  coyotes.\"    \"I make my beds near the cow trails. I have had better success making  my beds near a dead carcass than to set the traps by the carcass.  Last October we had an old coyote and five puppies that were killing  sheep for one of our neighbors. I set one trap where the herder  generally saw them. I caught the five young ones the first five  nights. The sixth morning I went to the traps and they were dug up  and the bait gone. I reset them and they were in the same shape the  next morning. I said to myself, \"Old girl, I will fool you.\" I made  another bed some thirty feet from the old one. I set four traps in  the new bed and fixed up the old one just the same as I had it  before, only minus the traps. The next morning she was caught and had  three feet in the traps. She ate all the bait on the old place and  had pawed up the ground.\"    \"I do not use scent. I have tried several kinds and consider them no  good. I have trailed coyotes where they have been trailing my tracks  and found them caught in the traps. I have set traps in the evening  and found coyotes in them the next morning. I have been trapping  coyotes and wolves for some five years in my county (Billings Co.) I  am located on the Little Missouri River a short distance south of the  old ranch that President Roosevelt used to own, what is called Bad  Land Country.\"      * * *    \"First boil your traps, and from the time you take them from the hot  water, use gloves till set, gloves to be smeared with blood. Take a  pair of old shoes and nail on some blocks of wood cut from 2 x 4  stuff, the length of your shoes; nail them on from the inside of  shoes with small nails, use gloves to do this. Now you are ready to  start to where your coyotes are, so take four No. 3 or 4 traps and  stake 3 feet long, with something to drive it with. Don't let traps  touch your clothes while carrying them.\"    \"When you get to your place that you have in mind, put stake thru all  four rings of traps and drive down to the level of the ground; put  your traps out each way so as to form a square, and bury each trap,  chain and all. Make everything look as natural as possible. Put a  small piece of wool or cotton under pan of trap and cover all well  with dirt; take what dirt you have left from digging to set trap and  carry away. Now leave your traps set till next evening, and then take  a piece of beef liver or fresh hog lungs, put on your same shoes with  blocks on and go put your bait in center of trap, (keeping gloves  on), and don't expect to catch your coyote the first night, as he  will likely come up close and take a look at things and go away  again, but the third or fourth night, he will try to sample your  bait, and when you catch your first one, the next one will walk in a  lot quicker.\"    \"I have caught as many as eight at one setting. Now mind you, in  going to trap and resetting them, wear your shoes and gloves. I  always bury my gloves and shoes in dirt to keep off human scent. I  have caught lots of them this way, although, I have other methods.  The main thing is to keep human scent off of trap and the ground  where your traps are set.\"      * * *    \"I saw a coyote jump over a sage brush about 6 rods from me one day,  and shot at him as he struck the ground with No. 6 fine shot and  killed him. As I went to pick him up, I found his hind foot in a No.  2 Newhouse trap. I took him out of the trap, took the trap, and  followed his track for about one-half mile toward the top of the  Butte, and found a dead horse. I left the trap, went back and skinned  the coyote, took his hide over to Mr. Muma.\"    \"About a week after killing the coyote, I went over the Butte, and  found a man at the horse covering up some traps. I told him of  killing the coyote and where to find the hide. He caught 11 coyotes  at this horse up to February 1st. They set their traps from 10 to 30  feet away from the horse, between sage brush, where coyotes would be  likely to walk in approaching the horse. They had eight traps set at  this place, fastened each one to a limb about 3 feet long. I think  they put some scent on the horse to keep the coyotes from eating him,  as I did not see as they had eaten any of it during the time they had  their traps set.\"      * * *    \"I will give some good coyote sets, altho the season is about over  now, March 8th, but some coyote trappers will trap most all summer in  order to get bounty. I find that this thing in handling your traps  with gloves on is all foolishness. Well, to begin with, take some  lard cracklings, say a half dozen. Go to some brush where there is a  trail going through, take your cracklings to the trail and scatter  cracklings along trail, and set traps one at each end of brush in  trail. This is a set hard to beat, boys. Another way is to find some  old cow path, and if you see coyote tracks in this set a few traps  along in it, cover traps, first spreading some brown paper over trap  then some dirt. Take an old coyote foot, make tracks all around your  trap, and you will have another good set.\"      [Illustration: A Trail Set.]    \"Here we have the coyote in larger numbers than any of the furry  tribe, and he is here to stay, for his cunning is a match for the  best of trappers, but many a one gets his toes pinched every season  and his coat is worn the next.\"    \"The best method that I know of to fool the cute chap is to find a  carcass, and if they are feeding off it, then take about six or eight  No. 3 or 4 Newhouse traps and set well back from bait. Set in trails  leading to and from the carcass, but be very careful and leave no  signs, for Mr. Coyote is very careful to look all around before  partaking of his meal, and while making this tour of inspection (if  you have your traps rightly and neatly set) he will get his foot  caught.\"    \"Never fasten the trap solid but to a drag so that he can drag it off  and not prevent all the others from coming to the bait, and also he  makes his hardest fight immediately after being caught, and if your  trap is staked solid and happens to have a weak place, or your coyote  is not securely caught, you are very apt to lose him.\"    \"Find an old badger hole with a large pile of dirt in front of it.  Take your traps, and everything needed to make the set with, walk  straight up to the place and don't move out of your tracks while you  set the traps. Put the bait, fresh meat of almost any kind, in the  hole, so that the coyote can just see it. Set one trap about six  inches from the mouth of the hole, a little to one side and another  on top of the mound of dirt. Bury the toggles carefully the length of  the chains from the traps and dig a hollow for the traps to set in.  Be sure they rest solidly in their beds, so that they will not tip  over if the coyote steps on the jaw. Cover neatly, with, first a  piece of paper, and then fine dirt. After the set is completed, use a  skunk's tail for a brush and smooth out all signs except your tracks.  Have it appear that you have walked by there without stopping. The  No. 4 Newhouse trap is the one to use, and the more coyotes you catch  in one place, the better the set will be.\"      [187 Traps Set at Badger Den.]    \"Around most ranches are hollows, ditches, or strips of brush, along  which the coyote approaches the ranch to catch chickens. Along one of  these places, about a quarter of a mile from the house is the place  to catch a coyote.\"    \"Take the entrails of a hog or other animal and go up the gulch until  you find a place where the ground is loose and there is no grass. Set  two traps about four feet apart and place the bait between, and about  one foot from one of the traps. If the animal tries to eat the bait,  it will be caught in this trap, and if it is suspicious and walks  around the bait, the other one will catch it. Take a piece of the  bait and erase all signs that you have made in setting the traps, so  that it will appear that you have only come there to dispose of the  bait.\"    \"Look at the traps every other day, not oftener, and never go close  to a set if it can be avoided. These may not be the best methods, but  they are good ones, and I have caught many coyotes with them. When  you get thirty or forty skins, you will think that they are well  worth the trouble necessary to secure them, just to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],[0,"The Man of the Forest (#19)"],[1,"back to it she saw a magnificent stag, with noble spreading  antlers, standing like a statue, his head up in alert and wild posture.  His color was gray. Beside him grazed two deer of slighter and more  graceful build, without horns.    \"It's downhill,\" whispered Dale. \"An' you're goin' to overshoot.\"    Then Helen saw that Roy had his rifle leveled.    \"Oh, don't!\" she cried.    Dale's remark evidently nettled Roy. He lowered the rifle.    \"Milt, it's me lookin' over this gun. How can you stand there an' tell  me I'm goin' to shoot high? I had a dead bead on him.\"    \"Roy, you didn't allow for downhill... Hurry. He sees us now.\"    Roy leveled the rifle and, taking aim as before, he fired. The buck  stood perfectly motionless, as if he had indeed been stone. The does,  however, jumped with a start, and gazed in fright in every direction.    \"Told you! I seen where your bullet hit thet pine--half a foot over his  shoulder. Try again an' aim at his legs.\"    Roy now took a quicker aim and pulled trigger. A puff of dust right at  the feet of the buck showed where Roy's lead had struck this time. With  a single bound, wonderful to see, the big deer was out of sight behind  trees and brush. The does leaped after him.    \"Doggone the luck!\" ejaculated Roy, red in the face, as he worked the  lever of his rifle. \"Never could shoot downhill, nohow!\"    His rueful apology to the girls for missing brought a merry laugh from  Bo.    \"Not for worlds would I have had you kill that beautiful deer!\" she  exclaimed.    \"We won't have venison steak off him, that's certain,\" remarked Dale,  dryly. \"An' maybe none off any deer, if Roy does the shootin'.\"    They resumed travel, sheering off to the right and keeping to the edge  of the intersecting canuon. At length they rode down to the bottom,  where a tiny brook babbled through willows, and they followed this for  a mile or so down to where it flowed into the larger stream. A dim trail  overgrown with grass showed at this point.    \"Here's where we part,\" said Dale. \"You'll beat me into my camp, but  I'll get there sometime after dark.\"    \"Hey, Milt, I forgot about thet darned pet cougar of yours an' the rest  of your menagerie. Reckon they won't scare the girls? Especially old  Tom?\"    \"You won't see Tom till I get home,\" replied Dale.    \"Ain't he corralled or tied up?\"    \"No. He has the run of the place.\"    \"Wal, good-by, then, an' rustle along.\"    Dale nodded to the girls, and, turning his horse, he drove the  pack-train before him up the open space between the stream and the  wooded slope.    Roy stepped off his horse with that single action which appeared such a  feat to Helen.    \"Guess I'd better cinch up,\" he said, as he threw a stirrup up over the  pommel of his saddle. \"You girls are goin' to see wild country.\"    \"Who's old Tom?\" queried Bo, curiously.    \"Why, he's Milt's pet cougar.\"    \"Cougar? That's a panther--a mountain-lion, didn't he say?\"    \"Shore is. Tom is a beauty. An' if he takes a likin' to you he'll love  you, play with you, maul you half to death.\"    Bo was all eyes.    \"Dale has other pets, too?\" she questioned, eagerly.    \"I never was up to his camp but what it was overrun with birds an'  squirrels an' vermin of all kinds, as tame as tame as cows. Too darn  tame, Milt says. But I can't figger thet. You girls will never want to  leave thet senaca of his.\"    \"What's a senaca?\" asked Helen, as she shifted her foot to let him  tighten the cinches on her saddle.    \"Thet's Mexican for park, I guess,\" he replied. \"These mountains are  full of parks; an', say, I don't ever want to see no prettier place till  I get to heaven.... There, Ranger, old boy, thet's tight.\"    He slapped the horse affectionately, and, turning to his own, he stepped  and swung his long length up.    \"It ain't deep crossin' here. Come on,\" he called, and spurred his bay.    The stream here was wide and it looked deep, but turned out to be  deceptive.    \"Wal, girls, here beginneth the second lesson,\" he drawled, cheerily.  \"Ride one behind the other--stick close to me--do what I do--an' holler  when you want to rest or if somethin' goes bad.\"    With that he spurred into the thicket. Bo went next and Helen followed.  The willows dragged at her so hard that she was unable to watch Roy, and  the result was that a low-sweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard  on the head. It hurt and startled her, and roused her mettle. Roy was  keeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well, and he led up  a slope to the open pine forest. Here the ride for several miles was  straight, level, and open. Helen liked the forest to-day. It was brown  and green, with patches of gold where the sun struck. She saw her first  bird--big blue grouse that whirred up from under her horse, and little  checkered gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing. Several times  Roy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle, and often  when he pointed Helen was not quick enough to see.    Helen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of  yesterday. So far she had been only barely conscious of sore places  and aching bones. These she would bear with. She loved the wild and the  beautiful, both of which increased manifestly with every mile. The sun  was warm, the air fragrant and cool, the sky blue as azure and so deep  that she imagined that she could look far up into it.    Suddenly Roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short.    \"Look!\" he called, sharply.    Bo screamed.    \"Not thet way! Here! Aw, he's gone!\"    \"Nell! It was a bear! I saw it! Oh! not like circus bears at all!\" cried  Bo.    Helen had missed her opportunity.    \"Reckon he was a grizzly, an' I'm jest as well pleased thet he loped  off,\" said Roy. Altering his course somewhat, he led to an old rotten  log that the bear had been digging in. \"After grubs. There, see his  track. He was a whopper shore enough.\"    They rode on, out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range,  gorge and ridge, green and black as far as Helen could see. The ranges  were bold and long, climbing to the central uplift, where a number of  fringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of Old Baldy.  Far as vision could see, to the right lay one rolling forest of pine,  beautiful and serene. Somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert,  but it was not in sight.    \"I see turkeys 'way down there,\" said Roy, backing away. \"We'll go down  and around an' mebbe I'll get a shot.\"    Descent beyond a rocky point was made through thick brush. This slope  consisted of wide benches covered with copses and scattered pines and  many oaks. Helen was delighted to see the familiar trees, although these  were different from Missouri oaks. Rugged and gnarled, but not tall,  these trees spread wide branches, the leaves of which were yellowing.  Roy led into a grassy glade, and, leaping off his horse, rifle in hand,  he prepared to shoot at something. Again Bo cried out, but this time it  was in delight. Then Helen saw an immense flock of turkeys, apparently  like the turkeys she knew at home, but these had bronze and checks  of white, and they looked wild. There must have been a hundred in the  flock, most of them hens. A few gobblers on the far side began the  flight, running swiftly off. Helen plainly heard the thud of their  feet. Roy shot once--twice--three times. Then rose a great commotion and  thumping, and a loud roar of many wings. Dust and leaves whirling in the  air were left where the turkeys had been.    \"Wal, I got two,\" said Roy, and he strode forward to pick up his game.  Returning, he tied two shiny, plump gobblers back of his saddle and  remounted his horse. \"We'll have turkey to-night, if Milt gets to camp  in time.\"    The ride was resumed. Helen never would have tired riding through those  oak groves, brown and sear and yellow, with leaves and acorns falling.    \"Bears have been workin' in here already,\" said Roy. \"I see tracks all  over. They eat acorns in the fall. An' mebbe we'll run into one yet.\"    The farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees, so that  dodging branches was no light task. Ranger did not seem to care how  close he passed a tree or under a limb, so that he missed them himself;  but Helen thereby got some additional bruises. Particularly hard was it,  when passing a tree, to get her knee out of the way in time.    Roy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation  and in places covered with a thick scum. But it had a current and an  outlet, proving it to be a huge, spring. Roy pointed down at a muddy  place.    \"Bear-wallow. He heard us comin'. Look at thet little track. Cub track.  An' look at these scratches on this tree, higher 'n my head. An old  she-bear stood up, an' scratched them.\"    Roy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree.    \"Woods's full of big bears,\" he said, grinning. \"An' I take it  particular kind of this old she rustlin' off with her cub. She-bears  with cubs are dangerous.\"    The next place to stir Helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom  of this canuon. Beech-trees, maples, aspens, overtopped by lofty  pines, made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown,  swirling current, and leaves drifted down, and stray flecks of golden  sunlight lightened the gloom. Here was hard riding to and fro across the  brook, between huge mossy boulders, and between aspens so close together  that Helen could scarce squeeze her knees through.    Once more Roy climbed out of that canuon, over a ridge into another,  down long wooded slopes and through scrub-oak thickets, on and on  till the sun stood straight overhead. Then he halted for a short rest,  unsaddled the horses to let them roll, and gave the girls some cold  lunch that he had packed. He strolled off with his gun, and, upon  returning, resaddled and gave the word to start.    That was the last of rest and easy traveling for the"]]]
