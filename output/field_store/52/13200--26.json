But as long as  I was on the island, I never knew what to expect when I had eaten;  sometimes all was well, and sometimes I was thrown into a miserable  sickness; nor could I ever distinguish what particular fish it was that  hurt me.    All day it streamed rain; the island ran like a sop, there was no dry  spot to be found; and when I lay down that night, between two boulders  that made a kind of roof, my feet were in a bog.    The second day I crossed the island to all sides. There was no one part  of it better than another; it was all desolate and rocky; nothing living  on it but game birds which I lacked the means to kill, and the gulls  which haunted the outlying rocks in a prodigious number. But the creek,  or strait, that cut off the isle from the main-land of the Ross, opened  out on the north into a bay, and the bay again opened into the Sound of  Iona; and it was the neighbourhood of this place that I chose to be my  home; though if I had thought upon the very name of home in such a spot,  I must have burst out weeping.    I had good reasons for my choice. There was in this part of the isle a  little hut of a house like a pig's hut, where fishers used to sleep when  they came there upon their business; but the turf roof of it had fallen  entirely in; so that the hut was of no use to me, and gave me less  shelter than my rocks. What was more important, the shell-fish on which  I lived grew there in great plenty; when the tide was out I could gather  a peck at a time: and this was doubtless a convenience. But the other  reason went deeper. I had become in no way used to the horrid solitude  of the isle, but still looked round me on all sides (like a man that  was hunted), between fear and hope that I might see some human creature  coming. Now, from a little up the hillside over the bay, I could catch a  sight of the great, ancient church and the roofs of the people's houses  in Iona. And on the other hand, over the low country of the Ross, I saw  smoke go up, morning and evening, as if from a homestead in a hollow of  the land.    I used to watch this smoke, when I was wet and cold, and had my head  half turned with loneliness; and think of the fireside and the  company, till my heart burned. It was the same with the roofs of Iona.  Altogether, this sight I had of men's homes and comfortable lives,  although it put a point on my own sufferings, yet it kept hope alive,  and helped me to eat my raw shell-fish (which had soon grown to be a  disgust), and saved me from the sense of horror I had whenever I was  quite alone with dead rocks, and fowls, and the rain, and the cold sea.    I say it kept hope alive; and indeed it seemed impossible that I should  be left to die on the shores of my own country, and within view of a  church-tower and the smoke of men's houses. But the second day passed;  and though as long as the light lasted I kept a bright look-out for  boats on the Sound or men passing on the Ross, no help came near me. It  still rained, and I turned in to sleep, as wet as ever, and with a cruel  sore throat, but a little comforted, perhaps, by having said good-night  to my next neighbours, the people of Iona.    Charles the Second declared a man could stay outdoors more days in the  year in the climate of England than in any other. This was very like a  king, with a palace at his back and changes of dry clothes. But he must  have had better luck on his flight from Worcester than I had on that  miserable isle. It was the height of the summer; yet it rained for more  than twenty-four hours, and did not clear until the afternoon of the  third day.    This was the day of incidents. In the morning I saw a red deer, a buck  with a fine spread of antlers, standing in the rain on the top of the  island; but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock, before  he trotted off upon the other side. I supposed he must have swum the  strait; though what should bring any creature to Earraid, was more than  I could fancy.    A little after, as I was jumping about after my limpets, I was startled  by a guinea-piece, which fell upon a rock in front of me and glanced off  into the sea. When the sailors gave me my money again, they kept back  not only about a third of the whole sum, but my father's leather purse;  so that from that day out, I carried my gold loose in a pocket with a  button. I now saw there must be a hole, and clapped my hand to the place  in a great hurry. But this was to lock the stable door after the steed  was stolen. I had left the shore at Queensferry with near on fifty  pounds; now I found no more than two guinea-pieces and a silver  shilling.    It is true I picked up a third guinea a little after, where it lay  shining on a piece of turf. That made a fortune of three pounds and four  shillings, English money, for a lad, the rightful heir of an estate, and  now starving on an isle at the extreme end of the wild Highlands.    This state of my affairs dashed me still further; and, indeed my plight  on that third morning was truly pitiful. My clothes were beginning to  rot; my stockings in particular were quite worn through, so that my  shanks went naked; my hands had grown quite soft with the continual  soaking; my throat was very sore, my strength had much abated, and my  heart so turned against the horrid stuff I was condemned to eat, that  the very sight of it came near to sicken me.    And yet the worst was not yet come.    There is a pretty high rock on the northwest of Earraid, which (because  it had a flat top and overlooked the Sound) I was much in the habit of  frequenting; not that ever I stayed in one place, save when asleep, my  misery giving me no rest. Indeed, I wore myself down with continual and  aimless goings and comings in the rain.    As soon, however, as the sun came out, I lay down on the top of that  rock to dry myself. The comfort of the sunshine is a thing I cannot  tell. It set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance, of which I had  begun to despair; and I scanned the sea and the Ross with a fresh  interest. On the south of my rock, a part of the island jutted out and  hid the open ocean, so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon  that side, and I be none the wiser.    Well, all of a sudden, a coble with a brown sail and a pair of fishers  aboard of it, came flying round that corner of the isle, bound for Iona.  I shouted out, and then fell on my knees on the rock and reached up my  hands and prayed to them. They were near enough to hear--I could even  see the colour of their hair; and there was no doubt but they observed  me, for they cried out in the Gaelic tongue, and laughed. But the boat  never turned aside, and flew on, right before my eyes, for Iona.    I could not believe such wickedness, and ran along the shore from rock  to rock, crying on them piteously even after they were out of reach  of my voice, I still cried and waved to them; and when they were quite  gone, I thought my heart would have burst. All the time of my troubles  I wept only twice. Once, when I could not reach the yard, and now, the  second time, when these fishers turned a deaf ear to my cries. But this  time I wept and roared like a wicked child, tearing up the turf with  my nails, and grinding my face in the earth. If a wish would kill men,  those two fishers would never have seen morning, and I should likely  have died upon my island.    When I was a little over my anger, I must eat again, but with such  loathing of the mess as I could now scarce control. Sure enough, I  should have done as well to fast, for my fishes poisoned me again. I had  all my first pains; my throat was so sore I could scarce swallow; I had  a fit of strong shuddering, which clucked my teeth together; and there  came on me that dreadful sense of illness, which we have no name for  either in Scotch or English. I thought I should have died, and made my  peace with God, forgiving all men, even my uncle and the fishers; and as  soon as I had thus made up my mind to the worst, clearness came upon me;  I observed the night was falling dry; my clothes were dried a good deal;  truly, I was in a better case than ever before, since I had landed on  the isle; and so I got to sleep at last, with a thought of gratitude.    The next day (which was the fourth of this horrible life of mine) I  found my bodily strength run very low. But the sun shone, the air was  sweet, and what I managed to eat of the shell-fish agreed well with me  and revived my courage.    I was scarce back on my rock (where I went always the first thing after  I had eaten) before I observed a boat coming down the Sound, and with  her head, as I thought, in my direction.    I began at once to hope and fear exceedingly; for I thought these men  might have thought better of their cruelty and be coming back to my  assistance. But another disappointment, such as yesterday's, was more  than I could bear. I turned my back, accordingly, upon the sea, and  did not look again till I had counted many hundreds. The boat was still  heading for the island. The next time I counted the full thousand, as  slowly as I could, my heart beating so as to hurt me. And then it was  out of all question. She was coming straight to Earraid!    I could no longer hold myself back, but ran to the seaside and out,  from one rock to another, as far as I could go. It is a marvel I was not  drowned; for when I was brought to a stand at last, my legs shook under  me, and my mouth was so dry, I must wet it with the sea-water before I  was able to shout.    All this time the boat was coming on; and now I was able to perceive  it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday. This I knew by  their hair, which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black.  But now there was a third man along with them, who looked to be of a  better class.

The forests of Cuba are of vast extent, and so dense as to be  almost impenetrable. It is estimated that of about 20,000,000  acres of land still remaining perfectly wild and uncultivated,  nearly 13,000,000 are uncleared forest. Mahogany and other hard  woods, such as the Cuban ebony, cedar, and granadilla, valuable  for manufactures, cabinet work and ship building are indigenous,  and are exported to a considerable extent.    The palm is the queen of the Cuban forests and is its most  valuable tree. It grows in every part of the island, but  especially in the west, giving at once character and beauty to the  scenery. The royal palm is the most common variety, and frequently  grows to a height of one hundred and twenty feet, the branches  numbering from twenty to twenty-five, in the center of which are  the hearts or buds of the plant, elevating themselves  perpendicularly with needle-like points.    This heart, enveloped in wrappers of tender white leaves, makes a  most delicious salad, and it is also boiled, like cauliflower, and  served with a delicate white sauce. The trunk of the palm is  composed of fibrous matter, which is stripped off and dried,  forming a narrow, thin board, which the natives use for the walls  of their cottages. The boughs are sometimes made to serve for  roofing, though palm leaves are usually used for this purpose, as  well as for the linings of the walls. \"El yarey\" is another  variety of the palm tree that is of great utility. From it the  native women make the palm leaf hats that are worn by almost all  the villagers and country people of Cuba.    TROPICAL FRUITS IN ABUNDANCE.    The fruits of Cuba are those common to the tropics. Bananas,  pineapples, oranges, lemons and bread-fruit all grow in abundance,  delicious to the taste and delightful to the eye.    Richard Henry Dana, Jr., after returning from a vacation trip to  Cuba, wrote a charming description of a fruit garden that it was  his good fortune to visit there:    \"The garden contained a remarkable variety of trees, including  some thrifty exotics. Here the mango, with its peach-like foliage,  was bending on the ground with the weight of its ripening fruit;  the alligator pear was marvelously beautiful in its full blossom,  suggesting, in form and color, the passion flower; the soft,  delicate foliage of the tamarind was like our sensitive plant; the  banana trees were in full bearing, the deep green fruit (it is  ripened and turns yellow off the tree), being in clusters of a  hundred, more or less, tipped at the same time by a single,  pendent, glutinous bud, nearly as large as a pineapple. The date  palm, so suggestive of the far east, and the only one we had seen  in Cuba, was represented by a choice specimen, imported in its  youth. There was also the star-apple tree, remarkable for its  uniform and graceful shape, full of green fruit, with here and  there a ripening specimen; so, also, was the favorite zapota, its  rusty coated fruit hanging in tempting abundance. From low, broad  spreading trees depended the grape fruit, as large as an infant's  head and yellow as gold, while the orange, lime and lemon trees,  bearing blossoms, green and ripe fruit all together, met the eye  at every turn, and filled the garden with fragrance. The cocoanut  palm, with its tall, straight stem, and clustering fruit,  dominated all the rest. Guava, fig, custard apple, and bread-fruit  trees, all were in bearing.    \"Our hospitable host plucked freely of the choicest for the benefit of  his chance visitors. Was there ever such a fruit garden before, or  elsewhere? It told of fertility of soil and deliciousness of climate, of  care, judgment, and liberal expenditure, all of which combined had  turned these half a dozen acres of land into a Gan Eden. Through his  orchard of Hesperides, we were accompanied also by the proprietor's two  lovely children, under nine years of age, with such wealth of promise in  their large black eyes and sweet faces as to fix them on our memory with  photographic fidelity. Before leaving the garden we returned with our  intelligent host once more to examine his beautiful specimens of  bananas, which, with its sister fruit, the plantain, forms so important  a staple of fruit in Cuba and throughout all tropical regions. It seems  that the female banana tree bears more fruit than the male, but not so  large. The average clusters of the former comprise here about one  hundred, but the latter rarely bears over sixty or seventy distinct  specimens of the cucumber-shaped product. From the center of its large,  broad leaves, which gather at the top, when it has reached the height of  twelve or fifteen feet, there springs forth a large purple bud ten  inches long, shaped like a huge acorn, though more pointed. This cone  hangs suspended from a strong stem, upon which a leaf unfolds,  displaying a cluster of young fruit. As soon as these are large enough  to support the heat of the sun and the chill of the rain, this  sheltering leaf drops off, and another unfolds, exposing its little  brood of fruit; and so the process goes on, until six or eight rings of  young bananas are started, forming, as we have said, bunches numbering  from seventy to a hundred. The banana is a herbaceous plant, and after  fruiting, its top dies; but it annually sprouts up again fresh from the  roots. From the unripe fruit, dried in the sun, a palatable and  nutritious flour is made.\"    THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY.    Cuban tobacco is famous throughout the world, and is one of the  most profitable of all its products. Prior to 1791 the crop was  sent to the national factories in Spain, by the \"Commercial  Company of Havana,\" under government contract, but during that  year the \"Factoria de Tobacco\" was established in Havana by the  government. The tobacco was classified as superior, medium and  inferior, and was received from the growers at fixed prices. In  1804 these were six, five and two and a half dollars per arrobe (a  Spanish unit of weight, subject to local variations, but averaging  about twenty-seven pounds avoirdupois).    By comparing the different prices with the quantity of each class of  tobacco produced, we find that the \"Factoria\" paid an average price of  $16 per hundred pounds for the leaf tobacco. With the expense of  manufacture, the cigars cost the government seventy-five cents per  pound; snuff, fine grain and good color, forty-three cents, and common  soft, or Seville, nineteen cents a pound in Havana. In good years, when  the crop amounted to 350,000 arrobes of leaf, 128,000 arrobes were  manufactured for Spain, 80,000 for Havana, 9,200 for Peru, 6,000 for  Buenos Ayres, 2,240 for Mexico, and 1,100 for Caracas and Campeachy.    In order to make up the amount of 315,000 arrobes, (for the crop  loses ten per cent. of its weight, in loss and damage in the  transportation and manufacture) we must suppose that 80,000  arrobes were consumed in the interior of the island; that is, in  the country, where the royal monopoly did not extend. The  maintenance of 120 slaves and the expenses of manufacture did not  exceed $12,000 yearly; but the salaries of the officers of the  \"Factoria\" amounted to $541,000. The value of the 128,000 arrobes  of tobacco sent to Spain, in the abundant years, either in cigars,  leaf or snuff, at the customary prices there, exceeded the sum of  five million dollars.    It is surprising to see in the returns of the exports from Havana  (documents published by the Consulado), that the exports for 1816  were only 3,400 arrobes; for the year 1823, only 13,900 arrobes of  leaf tobacco; and in 1825 only 70,302 pounds of cigars and 167,100  pounds of leaf tobacco and strips; but we must remember that no  branch of the contraband trade is more active than that in cigars.  The tobacco of the Vuelta de Abajo is the most celebrated, but  large quantities are exported which are produced in other parts of  the island. The cultivation of tobacco has been one of the most  uncertain branches of industry in Cuba. Trammeled by restrictions  and exactions, it was confined almost entirely to the poorer  classes of the population, who were enabled to raise a scanty and  uncertain crop through the advances of capital made them by the  \"Factoria.\" Since the suppression of this monopoly, it has had to  contend with the more popular and profitable pursuit of sugar  planting, which has successfully competed with it for the  employment of the capital, skill and labor of the island.    SUGAR CANE AND ITS CULTIVATION.    Maturin Ballou, in his \"Cuba Past and Present,\" published in 1885,  when the sugar industry was in its best days, writes an  interesting account of cane cultivation:    \"Sugar cane is cultivated like Indian corn, which it also  resembles in appearance. It is first planted in rows, not in  hills, and must be hoed and weeded until it gets high enough to  shade its roots. Then it may be left to itself until it reaches  maturity. This refers to the first laying out of a plantation,  which will afterwards continue fruitful for years, by very simple  processes of renewal. When thoroughly ripe the cane is of a light  golden yellow, streaked here and there with red. The top is dark  green, with long, narrow leaves depending, very much like those of  the corn stalk, from the center of which shoots upward a silvery  stem, a couple of feet in height, and from its tip grows a white  fringed plume of a delicate lilac hue. The effect of a large field  at its maturity, lying under a torrid sun, and gently yielding to  the breeze, is very fine, a picture to live in the memory ever  after.    \"In the competition between the products of beet-root sugar and  that from sugar cane, the former controls the market,"]]]
