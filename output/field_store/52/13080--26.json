He  could not be moved on the 16th, so I marched across the plain and put  up in some villages on its western side. Whilst waiting for the sheikh's  arrival, some villagers at night stole several loads of beads, and ran  off with them; but my men, finding the theft out in time, hunted them  down, and recovered all but one load--for the thieves had thrown their  loads down as soon as they found they were hotly pursued.    Early this morning I called all the head men of the village together,  and demanded the beads to be restored to me; for, as I was living with  them, they were responsible, according to the laws of the country. They  acknowledged the truth and force of my demand, and said they would each  give me a cow as an earnest, until their chief, who was absent, arrived.  This, of course, was objected to, as the chief, in his absence, must  have deputed some one to govern for him, and I expected him to settle  at once, that I might proceed with the march. Then selecting five of  my head men to conduct the case, with five of their elders, it was  considered my losses were equivalent to thirty head of cattle. As I  remitted the penalty to fifteen head, these were made over to me, and  we went on with the march--all feeling delighted with the issue but the  Hottentots, who, not liking the loss of the second fifteen cows, said  that in Kafirland, where the laws of the country are the same as here,  the whole would have been taken, and, as it was, they thought I was  depriving them of their rights to beef.    By a double march, the sheikh riding in a hammock slung on a pole, we  now made Kuale, or \"Partridge\" nullah, which, crossing the road to the  northward, drains these lands to the Malagarazi river, and thence into  the Tanganyika lake. Thence, having spent the night in the jungle, we  next morning pushed into the cultivated district of Rubuga, and put up  in some half-deserted tembes, where the ravages of war were even more  disgusting to witness than at Tura. The chief, as I have said, was a  slave, placed there by the Arabs on the condition that he would allow  all traders and travellers to help themselves without payment as long as  they chose to reside there. In consequence of this wicked arrangement,  I found it impossible to keep my men from picking and stealing. They  looked upon plunder as their fortune and right, and my interference as  unjustifiable.    By making another morning and evening march, we then reached the western  extremity of this cultivated opening; where, after sleeping the night,  we threaded through another forest to the little clearance of Kigue,  and in one more march through forest arrived in the large and fertile  district of Unyanyembe, the centre of Unyamuezi--the Land of the  Moon--within five miles of Kaze which is the name of a well in the  village of Tbora, now constituted the great central slave and ivory  merchants' depot. My losses up to this date (23d) were as follows:--One  Hottentot dead and five returned; one freeman sent back with the  Hottentots, and one flogged and turned off; twenty-five of Sultan  Majid's gardeners deserted; ninety-eight of the original Wanyamuezi  porters deserted; twelve mules and three donkeys dead. Besides which,  more than half of my property had been stolen; whilst the travelling  expenses had been unprecedented, in consequence of the severity of the  famine throughout the whole length of the march.

U-n-ya-muezi--Country of Moon--must have been one of the largest  kingdoms in Africa. It is little inferior in size to England, and of  much the same shape, though now, instead of being united, it is cut  up into petty states. In its northern extremities it is known by  the appellation U-sukuma--country north; and in the southern,  U-takama--country south. There are no historical traditions known to the  people; neither was anything ever written concerning their country,  as far as we know, until the Hindus, who traded with the east coast of  Africa, opened commercial dealings with its people in salves and ivory,  possibly some time prior to the birth of our Saviour, when, associated  with their name, Men of the Moon, sprang into existence the Mountains of  the Moon. These Men of the Moon are hereditarily the greatest traders in  Africa, and are the only people who, for love of barter and change, will  leave their own country as porters and go to the coast, and they do so  with as much zest as our country-folk go to a fair. As far back as we  can trace they have done this, and they still do it as heretofore.  The whole of their country ranges from 3000 to 4000 feet above the  sea-level--a high plateau, studded with little outcropping hills of  granite, between which, in the valleys, there are numerous fertilising  springs of fresh water, and rich iron ore is found in sandstone.  Generally industrious--much more so than most other negroes--they  cultivate extensively, make cloths of cotton in their own looms, smelt  iron and work it up very expertly, build tembes to live in over a large  portion of their country, but otherwise live in grass huts, and keep  flocks and herds of considerable extent.    The Wanyamuezi, however, are not a very well-favoured people in physical  appearance, and are much darker than either the Wazaramo or the Wagogo,  though many of their men are handsome and their women pretty; neither  are they well dressed or well armed, being wanting in pluck and  gallantry. Their women, generally, are better dressed than the men.  Cloths fastened round under the arms are their national costume, along  with a necklace of beads, large brass or copper wire armlets, and  a profusion of thin circles, called sambo, made of the giraffe's  tail-hairs bound round by the thinnest iron or copper wire; whilst the  men at home wear loin-cloths, but in the field, or whilst travelling,  simply hang a goat-skin over their shoulders, exposing at least  three-fourths of their body in a rather indecorous manner. In all other  respects they ornament themselves like the women, only, instead of a  long coil of wire wound up the arm, they content themselves with having  massive rings of copper or brass on the wrist; and they carry for arms a  spear and bow and arrows. All extract more or less their lower incisors,  and cut a [upside-down V shape] between their two upper incisors. The  whole tribe are desperate smokers, and greatly given to drink.    On the 24th, we all, as many as were left of us, marched into the  merchant's depot, S. lat. 5 deg. 0' 52\", and E. long. 33 deg. 1' 34\", [7]  escorted by Musa, who advanced to meet us, and guided us into his tembe,  where he begged we would reside with him until we could find men to  carry our property on to Karague. He added that he would accompany  us; for he was on the point of going there when my first instalment of  property arrived, but deferred his intention out of respect to myself.  He had been detained at Kaze ever since I last left it in consequence  of the Arabs having provoked a war with Manua Sera, to which he was  adverse. For a long time also he had been a chained prisoner; as the  Arabs, jealous of the favour Manua Sera had shown to him in preference  to themselves, basely accused him of supplying Manua Sera with  gunpowder, and bound him hand and foot \"like a slave.\" It was delightful  to see old Musa's face again, and the supremely hospitable, kind, and  courteous manner in which he looked after us, constantly bringing in all  kind of small delicacies, and seeing that nothing was wanting to make us  happy. All the property I had sent on in advance he had stored away; or  rather, I should say, as much as had reached him, for the road expenses  had eaten a great hole in it.    Once settled down into position, Sheikh Snay and the whole conclave of  Arab merchants came to call on me. They said they had an army of four  hundred slaves armed with muskets ready to take the field at once to  hunt down Manua Sera, who was cutting their caravan road to pieces,  and had just seized, by their latest reports, a whole convoy of their  ammunition. I begged them strongly to listen to reason, and accept my  advice as an old soldier, not to carry on their guerilla warfare in such  a headlong hurry, else they would be led a dance by Manua Sera, as we  had been by Tantia Topee in India. I advised them to allow me to mediate  between them, after telling them what a favourable interview I had had  with Manua Sera and Maula, whose son was at that moment concealed in  Musa's tembe. My advice, however, was not wanted. Snay knew better than  any one how to deal with savages, and determined on setting out as soon  as his army had \"eaten their beef-feast of war.\"    On my questioning him about the Nile, Snay still thought the N'yanza  was the source of the Jub river [8] as he did in our former journey, but  gave way when I told him that vessels frequented the Nile, as this also  coincided with his knowledge of navigators in vessels appearing on some  waters to the northward of Unyoro. In a great hurry he then bade  me good-bye; when, as he thought it would be final, I gave him, in  consideration of his former good services to the last expedition, one of  the gold watches given me by the Indian Government. I saw him no more,  though he and all the other Arabs sent me presents of cows, goats, and  rice, with a notice that they should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#19)"],[1," The  only apparent lapse of attention occurred when Donald Ross opened his  horn snuff-box, and after tapping solemnly upon its lid, drew forth a  huge pinch of snuff and passed it to his neighbor, who, after helping  himself in like manner, passed the box on. That the lapse was only  apparent was made evident by the air of abstraction with which this  operation was carried on, the snuff being held between the thumb and  forefinger for some moments, until a suitable resting-place in the  sermon was reached.    When the minister had arrived at the middle of the second head, he made  the discovery, as was not frequently the case, that the remotest limits  of the alloted time had been passed, and announcing that the subject  would be concluded on the following Sabbath, he summarily brought the  English service to a close, and dismissed the congregation with a brief  prayer, two verses of a psalm, and the benediction.    When Maimie realized that the service was really over, she felt as  if she had been in church for a week. After the benediction the  congregation passed out into the churchyard and disposed themselves in  groups about the gate and along the fences discussing the sermon and  making brief inquiries as to the \"weal and ill\" of the members of their  families. Mrs. Murray, leaving Hughie and Maimie to wander at will,  passed from group to group, welcomed by all with equal respect and  affection. Young men and old men, women and girls alike, were glad to  get her word. To-day, however, the young men were not at first to be  seen, but Mrs. Murray knew them well enough to suspect that they would  be found at the back of the church, so she passed slowly around the  church, greeting the people as she went, and upon turning the corner she  saw a crowd under the big maple, the rendezvous for the younger portion  of the congregation before \"church went in.\" In the center of the  group stood Ranald and Don, with Murdie, Don's eldest brother, a huge,  good-natured man, beside them, and Peter Ruagh, with his cousin Aleck,  and others of the clan. Ranald was standing, pale and silent, with his  head thrown back, as his manner was when in passion. The talk was mainly  between Aleck and Murdie, the others crowding eagerly about and putting  in a word as they could. Murdie was reasoning good-humoredly, Aleck  replying fiercely.    \"It was good enough for him,\" Mrs. Murray heard Don interject, in a  triumphant tone, to Murdie. But Murdie shut him off sternly.    \"Whisht, Don, you are not talking just now.\"    Don was about to reply when he caught sight of Mrs. Murray. \"Here's the  minister's wife,\" he said, in a low tone, and at once the group parted  in shamefaced confusion. But Murdie kept his face unmoved, and as Mrs.  Murray drew slowly near, said, in a quiet voice of easy good-humor, to  Aleck, who was standing with a face like that of a detected criminal:  \"Well, we will see about it to-morrow night, Aleck, at the post-office,\"  and he faced about to meet Mrs. Murray with an easy smile, while Aleck  turned away. But Mrs. Murray was not deceived, and she went straight to  the point.    \"Murdie,\" she said, quietly, when she had answered his greeting, \"will  you just come with me a little; I want to ask you about something.\"  And Murdie walked away with her, followed by the winks and nods of the  others.    What she said Murdie never told, but he came back to them more  determined upon peace than ever. The difficulty lay, not with the  good-natured Peter, who was ready enough to settle with Ranald, but with  the fiery Aleck, who represented the non-respectable section of the  clan McRae, who lived south of the Sixteenth, and had a reputation for  wildness. Fighting was their glory, and no one cared to enter upon a  feud with any one of them. Murdie had interfered on Ranald's behalf,  chiefly because he was Don's friend, but also because he was unwilling  that Ranald should be involved in a quarrel with the McRaes, which he  knew would be a serious affair for him. But now his strongest reason for  desiring peace was that he had pledged himself to the minister's wife  to bring it about in some way or other. So he took Peter off by himself,  and without much difficulty, persuaded him to act the magnanimous part  and drop the quarrel.    With Ranald he had a harder task. That young man was prepared to see his  quarrel through at whatever consequences to himself. He knew the McRaes,  and knew well their reputation, but that only made it more impossible  for him to retreat. But Murdie knew better than to argue with him, so  he turned away from him with an indifferent air, saying: \"Oh, very well.  Peter is willing to let it drop. You can do as you please, only I know  the minister's wife expects you to make it up.\"    \"What did she say to you, then?\" asked Ranald, fiercely.    \"She said a number of things that you don't need to know, but she said  this, whatever, 'He will make it up for my sake, I know.'\"    Ranald stood a moment silent, then said, suddenly: \"I will, too,\" and  walking straight over to Peter, he offered his hand, saying, \"I was too  quick, Peter, and I am willing to take as much as I gave. You can go  on.\"    But Peter was far too soft-hearted to accept that invitation, and  seizing Ranald's hand, said, heartily: \"Never mind, Ranald, it was my  own fault. We will just say nothing more about it.\"    \"There is the singing, boys,\" said Murdie. \"Come away. Let us go in.\"    He was all the more anxious to get the boys into the church when he saw  Aleck making toward them. He hurried Peter in before him, well pleased  with himself and his success as peacemaker, but especially delighted  that he could now turn his face toward the minister's pew, without  shame. And as he took his place in the back seat, with Peter Ruagh  beside him, the glance of pride and gratitude that flashed across the  congregation to him from the gray-brown eyes made Murdie feel more  than ever pleased at what he had been able to do. But he was somewhat  disturbed to notice that neither Ranald nor Don nor Aleck had followed  him into the church, and he waited uneasily for their coming.    In the meantime Straight Rory was winding his sinuous way through  Coleshill, the Gaelic rhythm of the psalm allowing of quavers and turns  impossible in the English.    In the pause following the second verse, Murdie was startled at the  sound of angry voices from without. More than Murdie heard that sound.  As Murdie glanced toward the pulpit he saw that the minister had risen  and was listening intently.    \"Behold--the--sparrow--findeth--out--\" chanted the precentor.    \"You are a liar!\" The words, in Aleck's fiery voice outside, fell  distinctly upon Murdie's ear, though few in the congregation seemed to  have heard. But while Murdie was making up his mind to slip out, the  minister was before him. Quickly he stepped down the pulpit stairs,  psalm-book in hand, and singing as he went, walked quietly to the back  door, and leaving his book on the window-sill, passed out. The singing  went calmly on, for the congregation were never surprised at anything  their minister did.    The next verse was nearly through, when the door opened, and in came  Don, followed by Aleck, looking somewhat disheveled and shaken up,  and two or three more. In a few moments the minister came in, took his  psalm-book from the window-sill, and striking up with the congregation,  \"Blest is the man whose strength thou art,\" marched up to the pulpit  again, with only an added flash in his blue eyes and a little more  triumphant swing to his coat-tails to indicate that anything had taken  place. But Murdie looked in vain for Ranald to appear, and waited,  uncertain what to do. He had a wholesome fear of the minister, more  especially in his present mood. Instinctively he turned toward the  minister's pew, and reading the look of anxious entreaty from the pale  face there, he waited till the congregation rose for prayer and then  slipped out, and was seen no more in church that day.    On the way home not a word was said about the disturbance. But after the  evening worship, when the minister had gone to his study for a smoke,  Hughie, who had heard the whole story from Don, told it to his mother  and Maimie in his most graphic manner.    \"It was not Ranald's fault, mother,\" he declared. \"You know Peter would  not let him alone, and Ranald hit him in the nose, and served him right,  too. But they made it all up, and they were just going into the church  again, when that Aleck McRae pulled Ranald back, and Ranald did not want  to fight at all, but he called Ranald a liar, and he could not help it,  but just hit him.\"    \"Who hit who?\" said Maimie. \"You're not making it very clear, Hughie.\"    \"Why, Ranald, of course, hit Aleck, and knocked him over, too,\" said  Hughie, with much satisfaction; \"and then Aleck--he is an awful fighter,  you know--jumped on Ranald and was pounding him just awful, the great  big brute, when out came papa. He stepped up and caught Aleck by the  neck and shook him just like a baby, saying, all the time, 'Would ye? I  will teach you to fight on the Sabbath day! Here! in with you, every  one of you!' and he threw him nearly into the door, and then they all  skedaddled into the church, I tell you, Don said. They were pretty badly  scart, too, but Don did not know what papa did to Ranald, and he did not  know where Ranald went, but he is pretty badly hurted, I am sure. That  great big Aleck McRae is old enough to be his father. Wasn't it mean of  him, mother?\"    Poor Hughie was almost in tears, and his mother, who sat listening too  eagerly to correct her little boy's ethics or grammar, was as nearly  overcome as he. She wished she knew where Ranald was. He had not  appeared at the evening Bible class, and Murdie had reported that he  could not find him anywhere.    She put Hughie to bed, and then saw Maimie to her room. But Maimie was  very unwilling to"]]]
