In his paper of 1792, HERSCHEL shows that the most distant satellite of  _Saturn_--_Japetus_--turns once on its axis in each revolution about its  primary, just as our moon does. He says of this:        \"I cannot help reflecting with some pleasure on the discovery of an      analogy which shows that a certain uniform plan is carried on among      the secondary planets of our solar system; and we may conjecture      that probably most of the satellites are governed by the same law;      especially if it be founded on such a construction of their figure      as makes them more ponderous towards their primary planets.\"    I believe the last suggestion to have been the first statement of the  possible arrangement of matter in satellites, which was afterwards so  forcibly maintained by HANSEN in his theory of the moon. HANSEN'S  researches show the consequences of such an arrangement, although they  do not prove its existence.    It should be recorded that the explanation which is to-day received of  the belts and bands upon _Jupiter_, is, I believe, first found in  HERSCHEL'S memoir on _Venus_ (1793). His memoir of 1797, on the  changeable brightness of the satellites of _Jupiter_, has already been  referred to. The times of the rotation of the satellites on their axes  was first determined by HERSCHEL from these observations, which also  contain accounts of the curious, and as yet unexplained, phenomena  attending their appearances on the disc of the planet.    HERSCHEL discovered in January, 1787, the two brighter satellites of  _Uranus_, now called _Oberon_ and _Titania_. They are among the faintest  objects in the solar system. A later discussion of all his observations  led him to the belief that there were four more, and he gives his  observations and computations in full. He says that of the existence of  additional satellites he has no doubt. Of these four, three were  exterior to the most distant satellite _Oberon_, the other was  \"interior\" to _Titania_.    It was not until 1834 that even _Oberon_ and _Titania_ were again  observed (by Sir JOHN HERSCHEL) with a telescope of twenty feet, similar  to that which had discovered them, and not until 1847 was the true state  of this system known, when Mr. LASSELL discovered _Ariel_ and _Umbriel_,  two satellites interior to _Titania_, neither of which was HERSCHEL'S  \"interior\" satellite. In 1848 and later years Mr. LASSELL, by the aid of  telescopes constructed by himself, fully settled the fact that only  four satellites of this planet existed. In 1874 I examined the  observations of HERSCHEL on his supposed \"interior\" satellite, thinking  that it might be possible that among the very few glimpses of it which  he recorded, some might have belonged to _Ariel_ and some to _Umbriel_,  and that by combining rare and almost accidental observations of two  satellites which really existed, he had come to announce the existence  of an \"interior\" satellite which had no existence in fact. Such I  believe to be the case. In 1801, April 17, HERSCHEL describes an  interior satellite in the position angle 189 deg., distant 18\" from  the planet. At that instant _Umbriel_, one of Mr. LASSELL'S satellites,  was in the position 191 deg., and distant 21\" from _Uranus_, in the  most favorable position for seeing it. The observation of 1794, March  27, _may_ belong to _Ariel_. At the best the investigation is of passing  interest only, and has nothing to do with the question of the discovery  of the satellites. HERSCHEL discovered the two brighter ones, and it  was only sixty years later that they were properly re-observed by Mr.  LASSELL, who has the great honor of having added as many more, and who  first settled the vexed question of satellites _exterior_ to _Oberon_,  and this with a reflecting telescope made by himself, which is  unequalled by any other of its dimensions.                          _Researches on the Nature of the Sun._    In the introduction to his paper on the _Nature and Construction of the  Sun and Fixed Stars_ (1795), HERSCHEL recounts what was known of the  nature of the sun at that time. NEWTON had shown that it was the centre  of the system; GALILEO and his successors had determined its rotation,  the place of its equator, its real diameter, magnitude, density,  distance, and the force of gravity on its surface. He says:        \"I should not wonder if, considering all this, we were induced to      think that nothing remained to be added; and yet we are still very      ignorant in regard to the internal construction of the sun.\" \"The      spots have been supposed to be solid bodies, the smoke of      volcanoes, the scum floating on an ocean of fluid matter, clouds,      opaque masses, and to be many other things.\" \"The sun itself has      been called a globe of fire, though, perhaps, metaphorically.\" \"It      is time now to profit by the observations we are in possession of.      I have availed myself of the labors of preceding astronomers, but      have been induced thereto by my own actual observation of the solar      phenomena.\"    HERSCHEL then refers to the theories advanced by his friend, Prof.  WILSON, of Glasgow, in 1774. WILSON maintained that the spots were  depressions below the sun's atmosphere, vast hollows as it were, at the  bases of which the true surface of the sun could be seen.    The essence of his theory was the existence of two different kinds of  matter in the sun: one solid and non-luminous--the nucleus--the other  gaseous and incandescent--the atmosphere. Vacant places in the  atmosphere, however caused, would show the black surface of the solid  mass below. These were the spots. No explanation could be given of the  _faculae_, bright streaks, which appear on the sun's surface from time  to time; but his theory accounted for the existence of the black  _nuclei_ of the spots, and for the existence of the _penumbrae_ about  these. The penumbra of a spot was formed by the thinner parts of the  atmosphere about the vacancy which surrounded the nucleus.    This theory of WILSON'S was adopted by HERSCHEL as a basis for his own,  and he brought numerous observations to confirm it, in the modified  shape which he gave to it.    According to HERSCHEL, the sun consisted of three essentially different  parts. First, there was a solid nucleus, non-luminous, cool, and even  capable of being inhabited. Second, above this was an atmosphere proper;  and, lastly, outside of this was a layer in which floated the clouds, or  bodies which gave to the solar surface its intense brilliancy:        \"According to my theory, a dark spot in the sun is a place in its      atmosphere which happens to be free from luminous decompositions\"      above it.    The two atmospheric layers, which will be of varying thickness about a  spot, will account for all the shades of darkness seen in the penumbra.  Ascending currents from the solar surface will elevate certain regions,  and may increase the solar activity near by, and will thus give rise to  faculae, which HERSCHEL shows to be elevated above the general surface.  It will not be necessary to give a further account of this theory. The  data in the possession of the modern theorist is a thousand-fold that to  be derived from HERSCHEL'S observations, and, while the subject of the  internal construction of the sun is to-day unsettled, we know that many  important, even fundamental, portions of his theory are untenable.  A remark of his should be recorded, however, as it has played a great  part in such theories:        \"That the emission of light must waste the sun, is not a difficulty      that can be opposed to our hypothesis. Many of the operations of      Nature are carried on in her great laboratory which we cannot      comprehend. Perhaps the many telescopic comets may restore to the      sun what is lost by the emission of light.\"    Arguments in favor of the habitability of both sun and moon are  contained in this paper; but they rest more on a metaphysical than a  scientific basis, and are to-day justly forgotten.                   _Researches on the Motion of the Sun and of                      the Solar System in Space._    In 1782 HERSCHEL writes, in regard to some of his discoveries of double  stars:        \"These may serve another very important end. I will just mention it,      though it is foreign to my present purpose. Several stars of the      first magnitude have been observed or suspected to have a proper      motion; hence we may surmise that our sun, with all its planets and      comets, may also have a motion towards some particular point of the      heavens. . . . If this surmise should have any foundation, it will show      itself in a series of some years in a kind of systematical parallax,      or change, due to the motion of the whole solar system.\"    In 1783 he published his paper _On the Proper Motion of the Solar  System_, which contained the proofs of his surmises of a year before.  That certain of the stars had in fact a _proper_ motion had been well  established by the astronomers of the eighteenth century. After all  allowances had been made for the effects of precession and other  displacements of a star's position which were produced by motions of the  earth, it was found that there were still small outstanding differences  which must be due to the motion of the star itself--its proper motion.  The quantity of this motion was not well known for any star when  HERSCHEL'S researches began. Before they were concluded, however,  MASKELYNE had deduced the proper motions of thirty-six stars--the  fundamental stars, so called--which included in their number _Sirius_,  _Procyon_, _Arcturus_, and generally the brightest stars.    It is _a priori_ evident that stars, in general, must have proper  motions, when once we admit the universality of gravitation. That any  fixed star should be entirely at rest would require that the attractions  on all sides of it should be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#19)"],[1,"  It will be readily understood that our table equipage is not of the best  or most sumptuous description. It fluctuates in extent a good deal from  time to time, and always presents the spectacle of pleasing variety. We  are never without appliances and substitutes of one kind or other; and  members of the society now and then add to the stock such items as they  severally deem desirable, or happen to pick up cheap \"down the river.\"    Experience has taught us that meat is meat still, although it may be  eaten direct out of frying-pan or stew-pot. It is just as good, better  we think, as when served up on Palissy ware or silver. Knives and forks  are distinctly a product of civilization; custom holds us to the use of  them. But what are a sheath-knife and a wooden skewer, if not  everything that is needed?    Those ultra-conservatives among our number, those rigid adherents to the  most primitive bush-life, of course despise all the refinements of the  table. Plates, forks, and spoons are to them degeneracies,--things that  no noble bushman needs or requires. They scorn any leanings towards  luxury and ease. Give _them_ a life that is totally free from the petty  trammels and slavish conventionalities of the old world!    At one time we were possessed of but a single plate, an iron one, which  had lost its enamel, and was half eaten through by rust; we had only one  fork, and that had only a prong and a half remaining. But we had our  cooking-pots and billies, our sheath-knives, wooden skewers, fingers,  and O'Gaygun's shingle-plates. What more could any one want? And if  there were not enough pannikins or mugs to hold our tea all round, there  were empty preserve-cans, gallipots, and oyster-shells! We were content  and happy. But this blissful state was to be rudely broken.    One day, a member of our party had been down Helensville way. There had  been an auction of the effects of a settler, who was moving off to the  South Island. Our chum had not been able to resist the temptation, and  had invested all he was worth in an assortment of goods. It was night  when he returned, and we were all in the shanty. He came up from the  boat, staggering under the weight of a great kit full of crocks and  such-like.    Of course, the excitement was great as we surveyed the heap of new  treasures we had acquired. Even O'Gaygun was enchanted for a moment,  till he remembered himself, and assumed the stern and savage bearing  befitting the leader of our conservatives. His scorn was withering.    \"F'what might this be?\" he would ask, fingering contemptuously first one  thing and then another.    \"An' f'what do ye do wid it, at all?\" he inquired, as article after  article was reviewed, affecting the airs of wonderment supposed to  belong to a child of nature.    Presently his humour changed, and he passed into the declamatory stage.    \"'Tis a sinful exthravagance! a temptin' av Providence!\" he exclaimed.  \"Plates! an' faaks! an' dishes! an' sacers! did ivver anny wan see the  loike? F'what do ye expict nixt? Kid gloves to work in, maybe! That  ivver I'd see the day whan sich degrading emblems av the ould  superstitions of sassiety was brought into the bush! Ough!\"    So much and more the O'Gaygun. But there is a sequel to the incident.    Some time after, when we had learnt to love and cherish these  acquisitions, the Little'un was one day detailed as hut-keeper. It so  happened that he had our entire stock of crockery to wash up, as we  generally work through the set before any one will act as scullery-maid.  The Little'un got through his task; he washed every plate and cup we had  got; but, not finding any towel or cloth handy, he disposed the things  on the stones in the chimney-place, round the stove to dry. There he  left them, and went off to chop firewood, forgetting to fasten the door.    Directly the Little'un's back was turned, a wandering pig arrived on the  scene. Seeing the open door, he resolved to prospect a bit, and  accordingly entered the shanty. What followed can now never be precisely  known, but conjecture allows us to arrive at the probable truth.    The pig's first discovery was a number of comical objects, whose purpose  he could not divine, stuck about among stones and gravel. He ruminated  over these awhile, and at last inquisitively snouted one dish that stood  alone, like a small monument. Down went the strange thing and smashed.  The pig thought this was singular, and was somewhat startled. Still, he  resolved to persevere in his investigations. He inserted his nose into a  long, hollow thing that lay there, but could not get it out of the jug  again. In his horror and fright at such an extraordinary accident, he  plunged round and round the place; and, as he went, things fell and  cracked and crashed under his feet in an awful and terrifying manner. At  last he hit the thing that covered his snout against something hard, and  it, too, broke. But a splinter wounded his nose, and made him squeal and  fairly scream with pain and fright. At last, executing one final  pirouette and gambado, while the strange things crunched and crackled at  every move of his, he rushed out through the door, oversetting a man who  was coming in with a bundle of firewood.    It was a scene of woe when the rest of us arrived from work. Concern and  consternation sat on every brow, as the Little'un unfolded his tale, and  we surveyed the universal smash of our crockery. Only O'Gaygun showed  signs of levity. In stentorian tones he shouted:--    \"A jedgment! a jedgment on ye, bhoys! The very bastes is sint to prache  aginst yer exthravagance an' lukshury! The pigs is tachin' ye as they  tached the howly St. Anthony av ould! O glory, glory! 'tis grand!\"    But his remarks were ill-timed. Conservatism was out of favour just  then, and the Liberals were in power. The wrath of the assembly was  turned upon this audacious prophet; and, excommunicated from the shanty,  it was very late before humanity compelled us to let him have his  supper. And I may mention that fresh pork chops were added to the bill  of fare that night.          CHAPTER VI.    OUR HOME-LIFE.      Among the friends of colonists at home in Britain, among those who talk  most and know least of this land of the blest, I specify three classes.  First, there are the people who talk of \"roughing it\" with an air of  rapturous enjoyment, and a Micawber-like roll of the voice, as if that  were really something good, something both pleasant and praiseworthy in  itself. Again, there are those who shudder at the bare idea, and who  conceive it, perhaps, to be a good deal worse than it really is. Lastly,  there are some who are quite vacuous in the matter, either because the  term conveys no meaning to their minds, or because Nature has made them  indifferent to personal comfort and discomfort.    Now, in the first place, roughing it is not a nice process. There is  nothing at all delightful or charming about it. Plainly, it is  suffering. Suffering of numberless discomforts and privations, slight  in themselves as a rule, though not invariably so, but certainly a  serious matter in the aggregate. Nor is there anything grand or glorious  in the prospect of roughing it. Merely in itself it does not add to a  man's good in any particular way. It has to be got through in order that  certain ends may be achieved. That is about the sum of it.    On the other hand, there is nothing to daunt healthy young fellows in  the prospect of roughing it. Only those who are delicate, or who are of  sensitive nature, need turn back from the possibility of it. And it must  be remembered that, to succeed eventually in any path of life  whatsoever, some sort of hardship, toil, and self-sacrifice must be  undergone.    Of course, you cannot carry the drawing-room with you into the bush.  That side of life, with much of the refinement belonging to it, is swept  completely out of your reach. And what is of more importance still, your  existence is apt to grow somewhat unintellectual. Yet these are matters  that are already remedying themselves. As comfort and competence are  gradually achieved, and as society becomes large, so do the higher  results of civilization follow. And as pioneering progresses into the  more advanced stages of improvement, so do the opportunities and  possibilities for mental work and culture become more generally and  readily appreciable.    To us, when we first came out from England, the life here seemed utterly  delightful, because it was so fresh and novel. We were quite captivated  with it. Our existence was a perpetual holiday and picnic, to which the  various difficulties and discomforts that cropped up only seemed to add  more zest. But we soon got over that. We soon began to find that it did  not rain rosewater here. A rude picnic prolonged day after day, year  after year, soon lost its enchantment, and merged into something very  like suffering. We began to yearn after those flesh-pots of Egypt which  we had left behind us; and there were times when we have regretted that  we ever emigrated at all.    Now we have settled down to a calm and placid contentment with our lot.  We begin to see what results are possible to us, and there are signs  that our chrysalis condition is finite after all, and that some reward  for our toil will be ours ere long. The days of our worst poverty and  difficulty lie behind us, and better things are in store.    We have been thankful for one thing. Our society in this district is  limited; but it comprises persons of some small amount of cultivation  and intelligence. We appreciate this at its fullest, for most of us  have, at one time or other, had to work in other parts of the colony,  where our only associates were of the rudest and dullest mental  organization. We are kindred spirits, and are happy in our way, making  light of difficulties, laughing at hardships and privations, and mocking  at poverty and toil. By this"]]]
