Furthermore, from our previous experience  with long-continued experiments of from 10 days to 2 weeks, it has been  found that oxygen can be supplied to the system readily and the amount  thus supplied determined accurately. Consequently, even in these short  experiments, we adhere to the original practice of supplying oxygen to  the air and noting the amount thus added.    The oxygen supply was formerly obtained from small steel cylinders of  the highly compressed gas. This gas was made by the calcium-manganate  method and represented a high degree of purity for commercial oxygen.  More recently we have been using oxygen of great purity made from liquid  air. Inasmuch as this oxygen is very pure and much less expensive than  the chemically-prepared oxygen, extensive provisions have been made for  its continued use. Instead of using small cylinders containing 10 cubic  feet and attaching thereto purifying devices in the shape of soda-lime  U-tubes and a sulphuric-acid drying-tube, we now use large cylinders and  we have found that the oxygen from liquid air is practically free from  carbon dioxide and water-vapor, the quantities present being wholly  negligible in experiments such as these. Consequently, no purifying  attachments are considered necessary and the oxygen is delivered  directly from the cylinder. The cylinders, containing 100 cubic feet  (2,830 liters), under a pressure of 120 atmospheres, are provided with  well-closing valves and weigh when fully charged 57 kilograms.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Diagram of oxygen balance and cylinder. At the  top is the balance arrangement, and at the center its support. At the  left is the oxygen cylinder, with reducing valve A, rubber tube D  leading from it, F the electro-magnet which opens and closes D, K the  hanger of the cylinder and support for the magnet, R the lever which  operates the supports for the cylinder and its counterpoise S, T' a box  which is raised and lowered by R, and T its surrounding box.]    It is highly desirable to determine the oxygen to within 0.1 gram, and  we are fortunate in having a balance of the type used frequently in this  laboratory which will enable us to weigh this cylinder accurately with a  sensitiveness of less than 0.1 gram. Since 1 liter of oxygen weighs 1.43  grams, it can be seen that the amount of oxygen introduced into the  chamber can be measured by this method within 70 cubic centimeters.  Even in experiments of but an hour's duration, where the amount of  oxygen admitted from the cylinder is but 25 to 30 grams, it can be seen  that the error in the weighing of the oxygen is much less than 1 per  cent.    The earlier forms of cylinders used were provided with valves which  required some special control and a rubber bag was attached to provide  for any sudden rush of gas. The construction of the valve and valve-stem  was unfortunately such that the well-known reduction valves could not be  attached without leakage under the high pressure of 120 atmospheres.  With the type of cylinder at present in use, such leakage does not occur  and therefore we simply attach to the oxygen cylinder a reduction-valve  which reduces the pressure from 120 atmospheres to about 2 or 3 pounds  to the square inch. The cylinder, together with the reduction valve, is  suspended on one arm of the balance. The equipment of the arrangement is  shown in fig. 31. (See also fig. 5, page 4.) The cylinder is supported  by a clamp K hung from the balance arm, and the reduction-valve A is  shown at the top. The counterpoise S consists of a piece of 7-inch pipe,  with caps at each end. At a convenient height a wooden shelf with  slightly raised rim is attached.    In spite of the rigid construction of this balance, it would be  detrimental to allow this enormous weight to remain on the knife-edges  permanently, so provision is made for raising the cylinders on a small  elevator arrangement which consists of small boxes of wood, T, into  which telescope other boxes, T'. A lever handle, R, when pressed  forward, raises T' by means of a roller bearing U, and when the handle  is raised the total weight of the cylinders is supported on the  platforms.    The balance is attached to an upright I-beam which is anchored to the  floor and ceiling of the calorimeter laboratory. Two large turnbuckle  eye-bolts give still greater rigidity at the bottom. The whole apparatus  is inclosed in a glass case, shown in fig. 5.      AUTOMATIC CONTROL OF OXYGEN SUPPLY.    The use of the reduction-valve has made the automatic control of the  oxygen supply much simpler than in the apparatus formerly used. The  details of the connections somewhat schematically outlined are given in  fig. 32, in which D is the oxygen cylinder, K the supporting band, A the  reduction-valve, and J the tension-equalizer attached to one of the  calorimeters. Having reduced the pressure to about 2 pounds by means of  the reduction-valve, the supply of oxygen can be shut off by putting a  pinch-cock on a rubber pipe leading from the reduction-valve to the  calorimeters. Instead of using the ordinary screw pinch-cock, this  connection is closed by a spring clamp. The spring E draws on the rod  which is connected at L and pinches the rubber tube tightly. The tension  at E can be released by an electro-magnet F, which when magnetized  exercises a pull on the iron rod, extends the spring E, and  simultaneously releases the pressure on the rubber tube at L. To make  the control perfectly automatic, the apparatus shown on the top of the  tension-equalizer J is employed. A wire ring, with a wire support, is  caused to pass up through a bearing fastened to the clamp above J. As  the air inside of the whole system becomes diminished in volume and the  rubber cap J sinks, there is a point at which a metal loop dips into two  mercury cups C and C', thus closing the circuit, which causes a current  of electricity to pass through F. This releases the pressure at L,  oxygen rushes in, and the rubber bag J becomes distended. As it is  distended, it lifts the metal loop out of the cups, C and C', and the  circuit is broken. There is, therefore, an alternate opening and closing  of this circuit with a corresponding admission of oxygen. The exact  position of the rubber diaphragm can be read when desired from a pointer  on a graduated scale attached to a support holding the terminals of the  electric wires. More frequently, however, when the volume is required,  instead of filling the bag to a definite point, as shown by the  pointer, a delicate manometer is attached to the can by means of a  pet-cock and the oxygen is admitted by operating the switch B until the  desired tension is reached.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Part of the oxygen cylinder and connections to  tension-equalizer. At the left is shown the upper half of the oxygen  cylinder with a detail of the electro-magnet and reducing-valve. D is  the cylinder; K, the band supporting the oxygen cylinder and  electro-magnet arrangement; F, the electro-magnet; E, the tension  spring; and L, the rubber tubing at a point where it is closed by the  clamp. The tension-equalizer and the method of closing the circuit  operating it are shown at the right. C and C' are two mercury cups into  which the wire loop dips, thus closing the circuit. B is a lever used  for short-circuiting for filling the diaphragm J. G is a sulphuric-acid  container; H, the quick-throw valve for shutting off the tension  equalizer J; M, part of the ingoing air-pipe; N, a plug connecting the  electric circuit with the electro-magnet; and O, a storage battery.]    In order to provide for the maximum sensitiveness for weighing D and its  appurtenances, the electric connection is broken at the cylinder by  means of the plug N and the rubber tube is connected by a glass  connector which can be disconnected during the process of weighing.  Obviously, provision is also made that there be no leakage of air out of  the system during the weighing. The current at F is obtained by means of  a storage battery O. The apparatus has been in use for some time in the  laboratory and has proved successful in the highest degree.      TENSION-EQUALIZER.    The rigid walls of the calorimeter and piping necessitate some provision  for minor fluctuations in the absolute volume of air in the confined  system. The apparatus was not constructed to withstand great  fluctuations in pressure, and thin walls were used, but it is deemed  inadvisable to submit it even to minor pressures, as thus there would be  danger of leakage of air through any possible small opening.  Furthermore, as the carbon dioxide and water-vapor are absorbed out of  the air-current, there is a constant decrease in volume, which is  ordinarily compensated by the admission of oxygen. It would be very  difficult to adjust the admission of oxygen so as to exactly compensate  for the contraction in volume caused by the absorption of water-vapor  and carbon dioxide. Consequently it is necessary to adjust some portion  of the circulating air-current so that there may be a contraction and  expansion in the volume without producing a pressure on the system. This  was done in a manner similar to that described in the earlier apparatus,  but on a much simpler plan.    To the air-pipe just before it entered the calorimeter was attached a  copper can with a rubber diaphragm top. This diaphragm, which is, as a  matter of fact, a ladies' pure rubber bathing-cap, allows for an  expansion or contraction of air in the system of 2 to 3 liters. The  apparatus shown in position is to be seen in fig. 25, in which the tin  can I is covered with the rubber diaphragm J. If there is any change in  volume, therefore, the rubber diaphragm rises or falls with it and under  ordinary conditions of an experiment this arrangement results in a  pressure in the chamber approximately that of the atmosphere.
