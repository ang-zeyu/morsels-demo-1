The    government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to spur    economic activity and trade. The economy is bolstered by annual    remittances from abroad of $600-$800 million, mostly from Greece and    Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit. Agriculture,    which accounts for about one-quarter of GDP, is held back because of    frequent drought and the need to modernize equipment, to clarify    property rights, and to consolidate small plots of land. Energy    shortages and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to    Albania's poor business environment, which make it difficult to    attract and sustain foreign investment. The planned construction of    a new thermal power plant near Vlore and improved transmission and    distribution facilities will help relieve the energy shortages.    Also, the government is moving slowly to improve the poor national    road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained economic    growth. On the positive side: growth was strong in 2003-05 and    inflation is not a problem.

In order to save appearances, the pacha was compelled to allow  them to ask for the pardon of the criminal whom he dared not punish.  This incident showed him that his authority was no longer paramount, and  he began to doubt the fidelity of his soldiers. The arrival of the  Ottoman fleet further enlightened him to his true position. Mussulman  and Christian alike, all the inhabitants of Northern Albania, who had  hitherto concealed their disaffection under an exaggerated semblance of  devotion, now hastened to make their submission to the sultan. The  Turks, continuing their success, laid siege to Parga, which was held by  Mehemet, Veli's eldest son. He was prepared to make a good defence, but  was betrayed by his troops, who opened the gates of the town, and he was  compelled to surrender at discretion. He was handed over to the  commander of the naval forces, by whom he was well treated, being  assigned the best cabin in the admiral's ship and given a brilliant  suite. He was assured that the sultan, whose only quarrel was with his  grandfather, would show him favour, and would even deal mercifully with  Ali, who, with his treasures, would merely be sent to an important  province in Asia Minor. He was induced to write in this strain to his  family and friends in order to induce them to lay down their arms.    The fall of Parga made a great impression on the Epirotes, who valued  its possession far above its real importance. Ali rent his garments and  cursed the days of his former good fortune, during which he had neither  known how to moderate his resentment nor to foresee the possibility of  any change of fortune.    The fall of Parga was succeeded by that of Arta of Mongliana, where was  situated Ali's country house, and of the post of the Five Wells. Then  came a yet more overwhelming piece of news Omar Brionis, whom Ali,  having formerly despoiled of its wealth, had none the less, recently  appointed general-in-chief, had gone over to the enemy with all his  troops!    Ali then decided on carrying out a project he had formed in case of  necessity, namely, on destroying the town of Janina, which would afford  shelter to the enemy and a point of attack against the fortresses in  which he was entrenched. When this resolution was known, the inhabitants  thought only of saving themselves and their property from the ruin from  which nothing could save their country. But most of them were only  preparing to depart, when Ali gave leave to the Albanian soldiers yet  faithful to him to sack the town.    The place was immediately invaded by an unbridled soldiery. The  Metropolitan church, where Greeks and Turks alike deposited their gold,  jewels, and merchandise, even as did the Greeks of old in the temples of  the gods, became the first object of pillage. Nothing was respected. The  cupboards containing sacred vestments were broken open, so were the  tombs of the archbishops, in which were interred reliquaries adorned  with precious stones; and the altar itself was defiled with the blood of  ruffians who fought for chalices and silver crosses.    The town presented an equally terrible spectacle; neither Christians nor  Mussulmans were spared, and the women's apartments, forcibly entered,  were given up to violence. Some of the more courageous citizens  endeavoured to defend their houses and families against these bandits,  and the clash of arms mingled with cries and groans. All at once the  roar of a terrible explosion rose above the other sounds, and a hail of  bombs, shells, grenade's, and rockets carried devastation and fire into  the different quarters of the town, which soon presented the spectacle  of an immense conflagration. Ali, seated on the great platform of the  castle by the lake, which seemed to vomit fire like a volcano, directed  the bombardment, pointing out the places which must be burnt. Churches,  mosques, libraries, bazaars, houses, all were destroyed, and the only  thing spared by the flames was the gallows, which remained standing in  the midst of the ruins.    Of the thirty thousand persons who inhabited Janina a few hours  previously, perhaps one half had escaped. But these had not fled many  leagues before they encountered the outposts of the Otto man army,  which, instead of helping or protecting them, fell upon them, plundered  them, and drove them towards the camp, where slavery awaited them. The  unhappy fugitives, taken thus between fire and sword, death behind and  slavery before, uttered a terrible cry, and fled in all directions.  Those who escaped the Turks were stopped in the hill passes by the  mountaineers rushing down to the rey; only large numbers who held  together could force a passage.    In some cases terror bestows extraordinary strength, there were mothers  who, with infants at the breast, covered on foot in one day the fourteen  leagues which separate Janina from Arta. But others, seized with the  pangs of travail in the midst of their flight, expired in the woods,  after giving birth to babes, who, destitute of succour, did not survive  their mothers. And young girls, having disfigured themselves by gashes,  hid themselves in caves, where they died of terror and hunger.    The Albanians, intoxicated with plunder and debauchery, refused to  return to the castle, and only thought of regaining their country and  enjoying the fruit of their rapine. But they were assailed on the way by  peasants covetous of their booty, and by those of Janina who had sought  refuge with them. The roads and passes were strewn with corpses, and the  trees by the roadside converted into gibbets. The murderers did not long  survive their victims.    The ruins of Janina were still smoking when, on the 19th August, Pacho  Bey made his entry. Having pitched his tent out of range of Ali's  cannon, he proclaimed aloud the firman which inaugurated him as Pacha of  Janina and Delvino, and then raised the tails, emblem of his dignity.  Ali heard on the summit of his keep the acclamations of the Turks who  saluted Pacho Bey, his former servant with the titles of Vali of Epirus,  and Ghazi, of Victorius. After this ceremony, the cadi read the  sentence, confirmed by the Mufti, which declared Tepelen Veli-Zade to  have forfeited his dignities and to be excommunicated, adding an  injunction to all the faithful that henceforth his name was not to be  pronounced except with the addition of \"Kara,\" or \"black,\" which is  bestowed on those cut off from the congregation of Sunnites, or Orthodox  Mohammedans. A Marabout then cast a stone towards the castle, and the  anathema upon \"Kara Ali\" was repeated by the whole Turkish army, ending  with the cry of \"Long live the sultan! So be it!\"    But it was not by ecclesiastical thunders that three fortresses could be  reduced, which were defended by artillerymen drawn from different  European armies, who had established an excellent school for gunners and  bombardiers. The besieged, having replied with hootings of contempt to  the acclamations of the besiegers, proceeded to enforce their scorn with  well-aimed cannon shots, while the rebel flotilla, dressed as if for a  fete-day, passed slowly before the Turks, saluting them with cannon-shot  if they ventured near the edge of the lake.    This noisy rhodomontade did not prevent Ali from being consumed with  grief and anxiety. The sight of his own troops, now in the camp of Pacho  Bey, the fear of being for ever separated from his sons, the thought of  his grandson in the enemy's hands, all threw him into the deepest  melancholy, and his sleepless eyes were constantly drowned in tears. He  refused his food, and sat for seven days with untrimmed beard, clad in  mourning, on a mat at the door of his antechamber, extending his hands  to his soldiers, and imploring them to slay him rather than abandon him.  His wives, seeing him in this state, and concluding all was lost, filled  the air with their lamentations. All began to think that grief would  bring Ali to the grave; but his soldiers, to whose protestations he at  first refused any credit, represented to him that their fate was  indissolubly linked with his. Pacho Bey having proclaimed that all taken  in arms for Ali would be shot as sharers in rebellion, it was therefore  their interest to support his resistance with all their power. They also  pointed out that the campaign was already advanced, and that the Turkish  army, which had forgotten its siege artillery at Constantinople, could  not possibly procure any before the end of October, by which time the  rains would begin, and the enemy would probably be short of food.  Moreover, in any case, it being impossible to winter in a ruined town,  the foe would be driven to seek shelter at a distance.    These representations, made with warmth conviction, and supported by  evidence, began to soothe the restless fever which was wasting Ali, and  the gentle caresses and persuasions of Basillisa, the beautiful  Christian captive, who had now been his wife for some time, completed  the cure.    At the same time his sister Chainitza gave him an astonishing example of  courage. She had persisted, in spite of all that could be said, in  residing in her castle of Libokovo. The population, whom she had cruelly  oppressed, demanded her death, but no one dared attack her. Superstition  declared that the spirit of her mother, with whom she kept up a  mysterious communication even beyond the portals of the grave, watched  over her safety. The menacing form of Kamco had, it was said, appeared  to several inhabitants of Tepelen, brandishing bones of the wretched  Kardikiotes, and demanding fresh victims with loud cries. The desire of  vengeance had urged some to brave these unknown dangers, and twice, a  warrior, clothed in black, had warned them back, forbidding them to lay  hands on a sacrilegious woman; whose punishment Heaven reserved to  itself, and twice they had"]]]
