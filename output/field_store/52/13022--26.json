Time had breathed upon his heart and, without  chilling it, given it a relieved sense of having taken the air. Isabel  felt her usual esteem for Time rise at a bound. Her friend's manner was  certainly that of a contented man, one who would rather like people, or  like her at least, to know him for such. \"There's something I must tell  you without more delay,\" he resumed. \"I've brought Ralph Touchett with  me.\"    \"Brought him with you?\" Isabel's surprise was great.    \"He's at the hotel; he was too tired to come out and has gone to bed.\"    \"I'll go to see him,\" she immediately said.    \"That's exactly what I hoped you'd do. I had an idea you hadn't seen  much of him since your marriage, that in fact your relations were a--a  little more formal. That's why I hesitated--like an awkward Briton.\"    \"I'm as fond of Ralph as ever,\" Isabel answered. \"But why has he come to  Rome?\" The declaration was very gentle, the question a little sharp.    \"Because he's very far gone, Mrs. Osmond.\"    \"Rome then is no place for him. I heard from him that he had determined  to give up his custom of wintering abroad and to remain in England,  indoors, in what he called an artificial climate.\"    \"Poor fellow, he doesn't succeed with the artificial! I went to see him  three weeks ago, at Gardencourt, and found him thoroughly ill. He has  been getting worse every year, and now he has no strength left. He  smokes no more cigarettes! He had got up an artificial climate indeed;  the house was as hot as Calcutta. Nevertheless he had suddenly taken it  into his head to start for Sicily. I didn't believe in it--neither did  the doctors, nor any of his friends. His mother, as I suppose you know,  is in America, so there was no one to prevent him. He stuck to his idea  that it would be the saving of him to spend the winter at Catania.  He said he could take servants and furniture, could make himself  comfortable, but in point of fact he hasn't brought anything. I wanted  him at least to go by sea, to save fatigue; but he said he hated the sea  and wished to stop at Rome. After that, though I thought it all rubbish,  I made up my mind to come with him. I'm acting as--what do you call it  in America?--as a kind of moderator. Poor Ralph's very moderate now. We  left England a fortnight ago, and he has been very bad on the way. He  can't keep warm, and the further south we come the more he feels the  cold. He has got rather a good man, but I'm afraid he's beyond human  help. I wanted him to take with him some clever fellow--I mean some  sharp young doctor; but he wouldn't hear of it. If you don't mind my  saying so, I think it was a most extraordinary time for Mrs. Touchett to  decide on going to America.\"    Isabel had listened eagerly; her face was full of pain and wonder. \"My  aunt does that at fixed periods and lets nothing turn her aside. When  the date comes round she starts; I think she'd have started if Ralph had  been dying.\"    \"I sometimes think he IS dying,\" Lord Warburton said.    Isabel sprang up. \"I'll go to him then now.\"    He checked her; he was a little disconcerted at the quick effect of his  words. \"I don't mean I thought so to-night. On the contrary, to-day,  in the train, he seemed particularly well; the idea of our reaching  Rome--he's very fond of Rome, you know--gave him strength. An hour ago,  when I bade him goodnight, he told me he was very tired, but very happy.  Go to him in the morning; that's all I mean. I didn't tell him I was  coming here; I didn't decide to till after we had separated. Then I  remembered he had told me you had an evening, and that it was this very  Thursday. It occurred to me to come in and tell you he's here, and let  you know you had perhaps better not wait for him to call. I think he  said he hadn't written to you.\" There was no need of Isabel's declaring  that she would act upon Lord Warburton's information; she looked, as she  sat there, like a winged creature held back. \"Let alone that I wanted to  see you for myself,\" her visitor gallantly added.    \"I don't understand Ralph's plan; it seems to me very wild,\" she said.  \"I was glad to think of him between those thick walls at Gardencourt.\"    \"He was completely alone there; the thick walls were his only company.\"    \"You went to see him; you've been extremely kind.\"    \"Oh dear, I had nothing to do,\" said Lord Warburton.    \"We hear, on the contrary, that you're doing great things. Every one  speaks of you as a great statesman, and I'm perpetually seeing your name  in the Times, which, by the way, doesn't appear to hold it in reverence.  You're apparently as wild a radical as ever.\"    \"I don't feel nearly so wild; you know the world has come round to me.  Touchett and I have kept up a sort of parliamentary debate all the way  from London. I tell him he's the last of the Tories, and he calls me  the King of the Goths--says I have, down to the details of my personal  appearance, every sign of the brute. So you see there's life in him  yet.\"    Isabel had many questions to ask about Ralph, but she abstained from  asking them all. She would see for herself on the morrow. She perceived  that after a little Lord Warburton would tire of that subject--he had a  conception of other possible topics. She was more and more able to say  to herself that he had recovered, and, what is more to the point, she  was able to say it without bitterness. He had been for her, of old,  such an image of urgency, of insistence, of something to be resisted  and reasoned with, that his reappearance at first menaced her with a new  trouble. But she was now reassured; she could see he only wished to live  with her on good terms, that she was to understand he had forgiven her  and was incapable of the bad taste of making pointed allusions. This was  not a form of revenge, of course; she had no suspicion of his wishing to  punish her by an exhibition of disillusionment; she did him the justice  to believe it had simply occurred to him that she would now take a  good-natured interest in knowing he was resigned. It was the resignation  of a healthy, manly nature, in which sentimental wounds could never  fester. British politics had cured him; she had known they would. She  gave an envious thought to the happier lot of men, who are always free  to plunge into the healing waters of action. Lord Warburton of course  spoke of the past, but he spoke of it without implications; he even  went so far as to allude to their former meeting in Rome as a very jolly  time. And he told her he had been immensely interested in hearing of her  marriage and that it was a great pleasure for him to make Mr. Osmond's  acquaintance--since he could hardly be said to have made it on the other  occasion. He had not written to her at the time of that passage in her  history, but he didn't apologise to her for this. The only thing he  implied was that they were old friends, intimate friends. It was very  much as an intimate friend that he said to her, suddenly, after a short  pause which he had occupied in smiling, as he looked about him, like a  person amused, at a provincial entertainment, by some innocent game of  guesses--    \"Well now, I suppose you're very happy and all that sort of thing?\"    Isabel answered with a quick laugh; the tone of his remark struck her  almost as the accent of comedy. \"Do you suppose if I were not I'd tell  you?\"    \"Well, I don't know. I don't see why not.\"    \"I do then. Fortunately, however, I'm very happy.\"    \"You've got an awfully good house.\"    \"Yes, it's very pleasant. But that's not my merit--it's my husband's.\"    \"You mean he has arranged it?\"    \"Yes, it was nothing when we came.\"    \"He must be very clever.\"    \"He has a genius for upholstery,\" said Isabel.    \"There's a great rage for that sort of thing now. But you must have a  taste of your own.\"    \"I enjoy things when they're done, but I've no ideas. I can never  propose anything.\"    \"Do you mean you accept what others propose?\"    \"Very willingly, for the most part.\"    \"That's a good thing to know. I shall propose to you something.\"    \"It will be very kind. I must say, however, that I've in a few small  ways a certain initiative. I should like for instance to introduce you  to some of these people.\"    \"Oh, please don't; I prefer sitting here. Unless it be to that young  lady in the blue dress. She has a charming face.\"    \"The one talking to the rosy young man? That's my husband's daughter.\"    \"Lucky man, your husband. What a dear little maid!\"    \"You must make her acquaintance.\"    \"In a moment--with pleasure. I like looking at her from here.\" He ceased  to look at her, however, very soon; his eyes constantly reverted to Mrs.  Osmond. \"Do you know I was wrong just now in saying you had changed?\" he  presently went on. \"You seem to me, after all, very much the same.\"    \"And yet I find it a great change to be married,\" said Isabel with mild  gaiety.    \"It affects most people more than it has affected you. You see I haven't  gone in for that.\"    \"It rather surprises me.\"    \"You ought to understand it, Mrs. Osmond. But I do want to marry,\" he  added more simply.    \"It ought to be very easy,\" Isabel said, rising--after which she  reflected, with a pang perhaps too visible, that she was hardly the  person to say this. It was perhaps because Lord Warburton divined the  pang that he generously forbore to call her attention to her not having  contributed then to the facility.    Edward Rosier had meanwhile seated himself on an ottoman beside Pansy's  tea-table. He pretended at first to talk to her about trifles, and she  asked him who was the new gentleman conversing with her stepmother.    \"He's an English lord,\" said Rosier. \"I don't know more.\"    \"I wonder if he'll have some tea. The English are so fond of tea.\"    \"Never mind that; I'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#19)"],[1,"lked, and stood with his fingers touching the haft of this same ax.  Jason knew his life was still in jeopardy, until he gave an answer that  satisfied these men.    He couldn't tell the truth. If they once suspected he was spying among  them to aid the city people, it would be the end. Nevertheless, he had  to be free to talk about the survival problem.    The answer hit him as soon as he had stated the problem. All this had  only taken an instant to consider, as he turned back to face the  invalid, and he answered at once. Trying to keep his voice normal and  unconcerned.    \"I'm Jason dinAlt, an ecologist, so you see I have the best reasons in  the universe for visiting this planet--\"    \"What is an ecologist?\" Rhes broke in. There was nothing in his voice to  indicate whether he meant the question seriously, or as a trap. All  traces of the ease of their earlier conversation were gone, his voice  had the deadliness of a stingwing's poison. Jason chose his words  carefully.    \"Simply stated, it is that branch of biology that considers the  relations between organisms and their environment. How climatic and  other factors affect the life forms, and how the life forms in turn  affect each other and the environment.\" That much Jason knew was  true--but he really knew very little more about the subject so he moved  on quickly.    \"I heard reports of this planet, and finally came here to study it  firsthand. I did what work I could in the shelter of the city, but it  wasn't enough. The people there think I'm crazy, but they finally agreed  to let me make a trip out here.\"    \"What arrangements have been made for your return?\" Naxa snapped.    \"None,\" Jason told him. \"They seemed quite sure that I would be killed  instantly and had no hope of me coming back. In fact, they refused to  let me go and I had to break away.\"    This answer seemed to satisfy Rhes and his face cracked into a mirthless  smile. \"They would think that, those junkmen. Can't move a meter outside  their own walls without an armor-plated machine as big as a barn. What  did they tell you about us?\"    Again Jason knew a lot depended on his answer. This time he thought  carefully before speaking.    \"Well ... perhaps I'll get that ax in the back of my neck for saying  this ... but I have to be honest. You must know what they think. They  told me you were filthy and ignorant savages who smelled. And you ...  well, had curious customs you practiced with the animals. In exchange  for food, they traded you beads and knives ...\"    Both Pyrrans broke into a convulsion of laughter at this. Rhes stopped  soon, from weakness, but Naxa laughed himself into a coughing fit and  had to splash water over his head from a gourd jug.    \"That I believe well enough,\" Rhes said, \"it sounds like the stupidity  they would talk. Those people know nothing of the world they live in. I  hope the rest of what you said is true, but even if it is not, you are  welcome here. You are from off-world, that I know. No junkman would have  lifted a finger to save my life. You are the first off-worlder my people  have ever known and for that you are doubly welcome. We will help you in  any way we can. My arm is your arm.\"    These last words had a ritual sound to them, and when Jason repeated  them, Naxa nodded at the correctness of this. At the same time, Jason  felt that they were more than empty ritual. Interdependence meant  survival on Pyrrus, and he knew that these people stood together to the  death against the mortal dangers around them. He hoped the ritual would  include him in that protective sphere.    \"That is enough for tonight,\" Rhes said. \"The spotted sickness had  weakened me, and your medicine has turned me to jelly. You will stay  here, Jason. There is a blanket, but no bed at least for now.\"    Enthusiasm had carried Jason this far, making him forget the two-gee  exertions of the long day. Now fatigue hit him a physical blow. He had  dim memories of refusing food and rolling in the blanket on the floor.  After that, oblivion.          XVII.      Every square inch of his body ached where the doubled gravity had  pressed his flesh to the unyielding wood of the floor. His eyes were  gummy and his mouth was filled with an indescribable taste that came off  in chunks. Sitting up was an effort and he had to stifle a groan as his  joints cracked.    \"Good day, Jason,\" Rhes called from the bed. \"If I didn't believe in  medicine so strongly, I would be tempted to say there is a miracle in  your machine that has cured me overnight.\"    There was no doubt that he was on the mend. The inflamed patches had  vanished and the burning light was gone from his eyes. He sat, propped  up on the bed, watching the morning sun melt the night's hailstorm into  the fields.    \"There's meat in the cabinet there,\" he said, \"and either water or visk  to drink.\"    The visk proved to be a distilled beverage of extraordinary potency that  instantly cleared the fog from Jason's brain, though it did leave a  slight ringing in his ears. And the meat was a tenderly smoked joint,  the best food he had tasted since leaving Darkhan. Taken together they  restored his faith in life and the future. He lowered his glass with a  relaxed sigh and looked around.    With the pressures of immediate survival and exhaustion removed, his  thoughts returned automatically to his problem. What were these people  really like--and how had they managed to survive in the deadly  wilderness? In the city he had been told they were savages. Yet there  was a carefully tended and repaired communicator on the wall. And by the  door a crossbow--that fired machined metal bolts, he could see the tool  marks still visible on their shanks. The one thing he needed was more  information. He could start by getting rid of some of his  misinformation.    \"Rhes, you laughed when I told you what the city people said, about  trading you trinkets for food. What do they really trade you?\"    \"Anything within certain limits,\" Rhes said. \"Small manufactured items,  such as electronic components for our communicators. Rustless alloys we  can't make in our forges, cutting tools, atomic electric converters that  produce power from any radioactive element. Things like that. Within  reason they'll trade anything we ask that isn't on the forbidden list.  They need the food badly.\"    \"And the items on the forbidden list--?\"    \"Weapons, of course, or anything that might be made into a powerful  weapon. They know we make gunpowder so we can't get anything like large  castings or seamless tubing we could make into heavy gun barrels. We  drill our own rifle barrels by hand, though the crossbow is quiet and  faster in the jungle. Then they don't like us to know very much, so the  only reading matter that gets to us are tech maintenance manuals, empty  of basic theory.    \"The last banned category you know about--medicine. This is the one  thing I cannot understand, that makes me burn with hatred with every  death they might have prevented.\"    \"I know their reasons,\" Jason said.    \"Then tell me, because I can think of none.\"    \"Survival--it's just that simple. I doubt if you realize it, but they  have a decreasing population. It is just a matter of years before they  will be gone. Whereas your people at least must have a stable--if not  slightly growing population--to have existed without their mechanical  protections. So in the city they hate you and are jealous of you at the  same time. If they gave you medicine and you prospered, you would be  winning the battle they have lost. I imagine they tolerate you as a  necessary evil, to supply them with food, otherwise they wish you were  all dead.\"    \"It makes sense,\" Rhes growled, slamming his fist against the bed. \"The  kind of twisted logic you expect from junkmen. They use us to feed them,  give us the absolute minimum in return, and at the same time cut us off  from the knowledge that will get us out of this hand to mouth existence.  Worse, far worse, they cut us off from the stars and the rest of  mankind.\" The hatred on his face was so strong that Jason unconsciously  drew back.    \"Do you think we are savages here, Jason? We act and look like animals  because we have to fight for existence on an animal level. Yet we know  about the stars. In that chest over there, sealed in metal, are over  thirty books, all we have. Fiction most of them, with some history and  general science thrown in. Enough to keep alive the stories of the  settlement here and the rest of the universe outside. We see the ships  land in the city and we know that up there are worlds we can only dream  about and never see. Do you wonder that we hate these beasts that call  themselves men, and would destroy them in an instant if we could? They  are right to keep weapons from us--for sure as the sun rises in the  morning we would kill them to a man if we were able, and take over the  things they have withheld from us.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was a harsh condemnation, but essentially a truthful one. At least  from the point of view of the outsiders. Jason didn't try to explain to  the angry man that the city Pyrrans looked on their attitude as being  the only possible and logical one. \"How did this battle between your two  groups ever come about?\" he asked.    \"I don't know,\" Rhes said, \"I've thought about it many times, but there  are no records of that period. We do know that we are all descended from  colonists who arrived at the same time. Somewhere, at some time, the two  groups separated. Perhaps it was a war, I've read about them in the  books. I have a partial theory, though I can't prove it, that it was the  location of the city.\"    \"Location--I don't understand.\"    \"Well, you know the junkmen, and you've seen where their city is. They  managed to put it right in the middle of the most savage spot on this  planet. You know they don't care about any living thing except  themselves, shoot "]]]
