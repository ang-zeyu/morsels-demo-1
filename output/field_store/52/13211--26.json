The exercise described in a previous chapter will help to bring a  quiet face. We must drop our heads with a sense of letting every  strain go out of our faces, and then let our heads carry our bodies  down as far as possible, dropping strain all the time, and while  rising slowly we must take the same care to drop all strain.    In taking the long breath, we must inhale without effort, and exhale  so easily that it seems as if the breath went out of itself, like  the balloons that children blow up and then watch them shrink as the  air leaves them.    Five minutes a day is very little time to spend to get a quiet face,  but just that five minutes--if followed consistently--will make us  so much more sensitive to the unquiet that we will sooner or later  turn away from it as by a natural instinct.          CHAPTER XIX    _About Voices_      I KNEW an old German--a wonderful teacher of the speaking voice--who  said \"the ancients believed that the soul of the man is  here\"--pointing to the pit of his stomach. \"I do not know,\" and he  shrugged his shoulders with expressive interest, \"it may be and it  may not be--but I know the soul of the voice is here--and you  Americans--you squeeze the life out of the word in your throat and  it is born dead.\"    That old artist spoke the truth--we Americans--most of us--do  squeeze the life out of our words and they are born dead. We squeeze  the life out by the strain which runs all through us and reflects  itself especially in our voices. Our throats are tense and closed;  our stomachs are tense and strained; with many of us the word is  dead before it is born.    Watch people talking in a very noisy place; hear how they scream at  the top of their lungs to get above the noise. Think of the amount  of nervous force they use in their efforts to be heard.    Now really when we are in the midst of a great noise and want to be  heard, what we have to do is to pitch our voices on a different key  from the noise about us. We can be heard as well, and better, if we  pitch our voices on a lower key than if we pitch them on a higher  key; and to pitch your voice on a low key requires very much less  effort than to strain to a high one.    I can imagine talking with some one for half an hour in a noisy  factory--for instance--and being more rested at the end of the half  hour than at the beginning. Because to pitch your voice low you must  drop some superfluous tension and dropping superfluous tension is  always restful.    I beg any or all of my readers to try this experiment the next time  they have to talk with a friend in a noisy street. At first the  habit of screaming above the noise of the wheels is strong on us and  it seems impossible that we should be heard if we speak below it. It  is difficult to pitch our voices low and keep them there. But if we  persist until we have formed a new habit, the change is delightful.    There is one other difficulty in the way; whoever is listening to us  may be in the habit of hearing a voice at high tension and so find  it difficult at first to adjust his ear to the lower voice and will  in consequence insist that the lower tone cannot be heard as easily.    It seems curious that our ears can be so much engaged in expecting  screaming that they cannot without a positive effort of the mind  readjust in order to listen to a lower tone. But it is so. And,  therefore, we must remember that to be thoroughly successful in  speaking intelligently below the noise we must beg our listeners to  change the habit of their ears as we ourselves must change the pitch  of our voices.    The result both to speaker and listener is worth the effort ten  times over.    As we habitually lower the pitch of our voices our words cease  gradually to be \"born dead.\" With a low-pitched voice everything  pertaining to the voice is more open and flexible and can react more  immediately to whatever may be in our minds to express.    Moreover, the voice itself may react back again upon our  dispositions. If a woman gets excited in an argument, especially if  she loses her temper, her voice will be raised higher and higher  until it reaches almost a shriek. And to hear two women \"argue\"  sometimes it may be truly said that we are listening to a  \"caterwauling.\" That is the only word that will describe it.    But if one of these women is sensitive enough to know she is  beginning to strain in her argument and will lower her voice and  persist in keeping it lowered the effect upon herself and the other  woman will put the \"caterwauling\" out of the question.    \"Caterwauling\" is an ugly word. It describes an ugly sound. If you  have ever found yourself in the past aiding and abetting such an  ugly sound in argument with another--say to yourself \"caterwauling,\"  \"caterwauling,\" \"I have been 'caterwauling' with Jane Smith, or  Maria Jones,\" or whoever it may be, and that will bring out in such  clear relief the ugliness of the word and the sound that you will  turn earnestly toward a more quiet way of speaking.    The next time you start on the strain of an argument and your voice  begins to go up, up, up--something will whisper in your ear  \"caterwauling\" and you will at once, in self-defense, lower your  voice or stop speaking altogether.    It is good to call ugly things by their ugliest names. It helps us  to see them in their true light and makes us more earnest in our  efforts to get away from them altogether.    I was once a guest at a large reception and the noise of talking  seemed to be a roar, when suddenly an elderly man got up on a chair  and called \"silence,\" and having obtained silence he said, \"it has  been suggested that every one in this room should speak in a lower  tone of voice.\"    The response was immediate. Every one went on talking with the same  interest only in a lower tone of voice with a result that was both  delightful and soothing.    I say every one--there were perhaps half a dozen whom I observed who  looked and I have no doubt said \"how impudent.\" So it was \"impudent\"  if you chose to take it so--but most of the people did not choose to  take it so and so brought a more quiet atmosphere and a happy change  of tone.    Theophile Gautier said that the voice was nearer the soul  than any other expressive part of us. It is certainly a very  striking indicator of the state of the soul. If we accustom  ourselves to listen to the voices of those about us we detect more  and more clearly various qualities of the man or the woman in the  voice, and if we grow sensitive to the strain in our own voices and  drop it at once when it is perceived, we feel a proportionate gain.    I knew of a blind doctor who habitually told character by the tone  of the voice, and men and women often went to him to have their  characters described as one would go to a palmist.    Once a woman spoke to him earnestly for that purpose and he replied,  \"Madam, your voice has been so much cultivated that there is nothing  of you in it--I cannot tell your real character at all.\" The only  way to cultivate a voice is to open it to its best  possibilities--not to teach its owner to pose or to imitate a  beautiful tone until it has acquired the beautiful tone habit. Such  tones are always artificial and the unreality in them can be easily  detected by a quick ear.    Most great singers are arrant hypocrites. There is nothing of  themselves in their tone. The trouble is to have a really beautiful  voice one must have a really beautiful soul behind it.    If you drop the tension of your voice in an argument for the sake of  getting a clearer mind and meeting your opponent without resistance,  your voice helps your mind and your mind helps your voice.    They act and react upon one another with mutual benefit. If you  lower your voice in general for the sake of being more quiet, and so  more agreeable and useful to those about you, then again the mental  or moral effort and the physical effort help one another.    It adds greatly to a woman's attraction and to her use to have a  low, quiet voice--and if any reader is persisting in the effort to  get five minutes absolute quiet in every day let her finish the  exercise by saying something in a quiet, restful tone of voice.    It will make her more sensitive to her unrestful tones outside, and  so help her to improve them.          CHAPTER XX    _About Frights_      HERE are two true stories and a remarkable contrast. A nerve  specialist was called to see a young girl who had had nervous  prostration for two years. The physician was told before seeing the  patient that the illness had started through fright occasioned by  the patient's waking and discovering a burglar in her room.    Almost the moment the doctor entered the sick room, he was accosted  with: \"Doctor, do you know what made me ill? It was frightful.\" Then  followed a minute description of her sudden awakening and seeing the  man at her bureau drawers.    This story had been lived over and over by the young girl and her  friends for two years, until the strain in her brain caused by the  repetition of the impression of fright was so intense that no skill  nor tact seemed able to remove it. She simply would not let it go,  and she never got really well.    Now, see the contrast. Another young woman had a similar burglar  experience, and for several nights after she woke with a start at  the same hour. For the first two or three nights she lay and  shivered until she shivered herself to sleep.    Then she noticed how tightened up she was in every muscle when she  woke, and she bethought herself that she would put her mind on  relaxing her muscles and getting rid of the tension in her nerves.  She did this persistently, so that when she woke with the burglar  fright it was at once a reminder to relax.

They know \"nothing of the corruptness  and faithless arts of Europe.\" \"They live in great tranquillity and are  seldom at war with their neighbours.\" They are \"all kindness and  goodwill to one another.. One of the greatest pleasures of the  Hottentots certainly lies in their gifts and good offices to one  another.\" \"The integrity of the Hottentots, their strictness and  celerity in the exercise of justice, and their chastity, are things in  which they excel all or most nations in the world.\"(15)    Tachart, Barrow, and Moodie(16) fully confirm Kolben's testimony. Let me  only remark that when Kolben wrote that \"they are certainly the most  friendly, the most liberal and the most benevolent people to one another  that ever appeared on the earth\" (i. 332), he wrote a sentence which has  continually appeared since in the description of savages. When first  meeting with primitive races, the Europeans usually make a caricature of  their life; but when an intelligent man has stayed among them for a  longer time, he generally describes them as the \"kindest\" or \"the  gentlest\" race on the earth. These very same words have been applied to  the Ostyaks, the Samoyedes, the Eskimos, the Dayaks, the Aleoutes, the  Papuas, and so on, by the highest authorities. I also remember having  read them applied to the Tunguses, the Tchuktchis, the Sioux, and  several others. The very frequency of that high commendation already  speaks volumes in itself.    The natives of Australia do not stand on a higher level of development  than their South African brothers. Their huts are of the same character:  very often simple screens are the only protection against cold winds. In  their food they are most indifferent: they devour horribly putrefied  corpses, and cannibalism is resorted to in times of scarcity. When first  discovered by Europeans, they had no implements but in stone or bone,  and these were of the roughest description. Some tribes had even no  canoes, and did not know barter-trade. And yet, when their manners and  customs were carefully studied, they proved to be living under that  elaborate clan organization which I have mentioned on a preceding  page.(17)    The territory they inhabit is usually allotted between the different  gentes or clans; but the hunting and fishing territories of each clan  are kept in common, and the produce of fishing and hunting belongs to  the whole clan; so also the fishing and hunting implements.(18) The  meals are taken in common. Like many other savages, they respect certain  regulations as to the seasons when certain gums and grasses may be  collected.(19) As to their morality altogether, we cannot do better than  transcribe the following answers given to the questions of the Paris  Anthropological Society by Lumholtz, a missionary who sojourned in North  Queensland:(20)--    \"The feeling of friendship is known among them; it is strong. Weak  people are usually supported; sick people are very well attended to;  they never are abandoned or killed. These tribes are cannibals, but they  very seldom eat members of their own tribe (when immolated on religious  principles, I suppose); they eat strangers only. The parents love their  children, play with them, and pet them. Infanticide meets with common  approval. Old people are very well treated, never put to death. No  religion, no idols, only a fear of death. Polygamous marriage, quarrels  arising within the tribe are settled by means of duels fought with  wooden swords and shields. No slaves; no culture of any kind; no  pottery; no dress, save an apron sometimes worn by women. The clan  consists of two hundred individuals, divided into four classes of men  and four of women; marriage being only permitted within the usual  classes, and never within the gens.\"    For the Papuas, closely akin to the above, we have the testimony of G.L.  Bink, who stayed in New Guinea, chiefly in Geelwink Bay, from 1871 to  1883. Here is the essence of his answers to the same questioner:(21)--    \"They are sociable and cheerful; they laugh very much. Rather timid than  courageous. Friendship is relatively strong among persons belonging to  different tribes, and still stronger within the tribe. A friend will  often pay the debt of his friend, the stipulation being that the latter  will repay it without interest to the children of the lender. They take  care of the ill and the old; old people are never abandoned, and in no  case are they killed--unless it be a slave who was ill for a long time.  War prisoners are sometimes eaten. The children are very much petted and  loved. Old and feeble war prisoners are killed, the others are sold as  slaves. They have no religion, no gods, no idols, no authority of any  description; the oldest man in the family is the judge. In cases of  adultery a fine is paid, and part of it goes to the negoria (the  community). The soil is kept in common, but the crop belongs to those  who have grown it. They have pottery, and know barter-trade--the custom  being that the merchant gives them the goods, whereupon they return to  their houses and bring the native goods required by the merchant; if the  latter cannot be obtained, the European goods are returned.(22) They are  head-hunters, and in so doing they prosecute blood revenge. 'Sometimes,'  Finsch says, 'the affair is referred to the Rajah of Namototte, who  terminates it by imposing a fine.'\"    When well treated, the Papuas are very kind. Miklukho-Maclay landed on  the eastern coast of New Guinea, followed by one single man, stayed for  two years among tribes reported to be cannibals, and left them with  regret; he returned again to stay one year more among them, and never  had he any conflict to complain of. True that his rule was never--under  no pretext whatever--to say anything which was not truth, nor make any  promise which he could not keep. These poor creatures, who even do not  know how to obtain fire, and carefully maintain it in their huts, live  under their primitive communism, without any chiefs; and within their  villages they have no quarrels worth speaking of. They work in common,  just enough to get the food of the day; they rear their children in  common; and in the evenings they dress themselves as coquettishly as  they can, and dance. Like all savages, they are fond of dancing. Each  village has its barla, or balai--the \"long house,\" \"longue maison,\" or  \"grande maison\"--for the unmarried men, for social gatherings, and for  the discussion of common affairs--again a trait which is common to most  inhabitants of the Pacific Islands, the Eskimos, the Red Indians, and so  on. Whole groups of villages are on friendly terms, and visit each other  en bloc.    Unhappily, feuds are not uncommon--not in consequence of \"Overstocking  of the area,\" or \"keen competition,\" and like inventions of a mercantile  century, but chiefly in consequence of superstition. As soon as any one  falls ill, his friends and relatives come together, and deliberately  discuss who might be the cause of the illness. All possible enemies are  considered, every one confesses of his own petty quarrels, and finally  the real cause is discovered. An enemy from the next village has called  it down, and a raid upon that village is decided upon. Therefore, feuds  are rather frequent, even between the coast villages, not to say a word  of the cannibal mountaineers who are considered as real witches and  enemies, though, on a closer acquaintance, they prove to be exactly the  same sort of people as their neighbours on the seacoast.(23)    Many striking pages could be written about the harmony which prevails in  the villages of the Polynesian inhabitants of the Pacific Islands. But  they belong to a more advanced stage of civilization. So we shall now  take our illustrations from the far north. I must mention, however,  before leaving the Southern Hemisphere, that even the Fuegians, whose  reputation has been so bad, appear under a much better light since they  begin to be better known. A few French missionaries who stay among them  \"know of no act of malevolence to complain of.\" In their clans,  consisting of from 120 to 150 souls, they practise the same primitive  communism as the Papuas; they share everything in common, and treat  their old people very well. Peace prevails among these tribes.(24) With  the Eskimos and their nearest congeners, the Thlinkets, the Koloshes,  and the Aleoutes, we find one of the nearest illustrations of what man  may have been during the glacial age. Their implements hardly differ  from those of palaeolithic man, and some of their tribes do not yet know  fishing: they simply spear the fish with a kind of harpoon.(25) They  know the use of iron, but they receive it from the Europeans, or find it  on wrecked ships. Their social organization is of a very primitive kind,  though they already have emerged from the stage of \"communal marriage,\"  even under the gentile restrictions. They live in families, but the  family bonds are often broken; husbands and wives are often  exchanged.(26) The families, however, remain united in clans, and how  could it be otherwise? How could they sustain the hard struggle for life  unless by closely combining their forces? So they do, and the tribal  bonds are closest where the struggle for life is hardest, namely, in  North-East Greenland. The \"long house\" is their usual dwelling, and  several families lodge in it, separated from each other by small  partitions of ragged furs, with a common passage in the front. Sometimes  the house has the shape of a cross, and in such case a common fire is  kept in the centre. The German Expedition which spent a winter close by  one of those \"long houses\" could ascertain that \"no quarrel disturbed  the peace, "]]]
