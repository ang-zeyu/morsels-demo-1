Many of his  statements are to-day prophecies fulfilled.    It is not an imaginary man of letters who starts on a trip in obedience  to a doctor's orders. It is Alfredo Panzini, exhausted from many labors.  He goes wherever his fancy takes him, to Vicenza, Bologna, Pisa, Venice,  and it is with the literary memories of these places that he is chiefly  concerned. At Pisa it is Leopardi, Shelley, and Byron; at Vicenza,  Fogazzaro; but at Bologna the memories become more personal. Here he sat  at the feet of Carducci and learned to love and respect him; here his  budding fancies first showed indications of blooming; here he first  essayed amatory flights. He chances upon an old flame of his student  days leading the old life in the old home, except that she had taken to  writing poems and insists on having his opinion of them. His account of  how he succeeded in meeting her wishes and still maintained his  self-respect is a masterpiece of ingenuousness. The least thing suffices  to start a train of thought and reflection or to decide his next  tarrying-place. The volume ends with an interesting account of a visit  to the birthplace of Pascoli, the socialist and idealist poet of the  Romagna.    In his \"Piccole Storie del Mondo Grande\" he describes a pilgrimage to  the country of Leopardi, and to Umbria. It is filled with little  anecdotes of literary immortals who wandered there, and of references  that are more significant to Italians than to foreigners, and through it  all there is a strange, melancholy humor which is quite characteristic  of Panzini.    The two novels which he has written show that he has the art of the  story-teller in narration, sequence, and constructiveness, but they lack  what the dramatists call action. \"Io Cerco Moglie\" (\"I Seek a Wife\") is  his best work. Ginetto Sconer, who oozes prosperity and  self-satisfaction, proceeds in a businesslike way to select a wife. He  consults a pastry-cook and a doctor, to the great glee of the reader. He  sees women in three categories: those who presume to disturb the dreams  of anchorites and are still men's pleasure and despair; the aristocratic  blue-stocking; and the domestic paragon. He had not contemplated  marrying a blue-stocking or even aspiring to blue blood, but when he  meets Countess Ghiselda he realizes that ambition expands with amatory  awakement. Her freedom is handicapped by the attentions of a Futuristic  poet whose intellectual productions and antics are amusing to every one  save Cavaliere Sconer. He has peeps into spiritual and emotional vistas,  but he yields finally to the flesh-box and woos the daughter of the  woman who places a caramel in the mouth of her husband every morning  before he goes to his office.    Signor Panzini knows the present-day Borghese, their thoughts, their  virtues, their absurdities, and their charm, and he has depicted them in  this book in the most interesting way.    Signor Panzini is not what is called a feminist fan, and he utilizes  Ginetto Sconer, who is seeking the ideal mate, as a mouthpiece for his  own convictions and sentiments concerning women. Italy is likely to be  one of the last countries that will yield woman the freedom for  emotional and intellectual development to which she is entitled, and  when it comes, as it is bound to do, it will be despite the kindly and  sentimental protests and ironies of such oppositionists as Signor  Panzini.    \"La Madonna di Mama\" (\"The Madonna of Mamma\") is, in addition to a  splendid character study, a revelation of the disturbance caused in a  gentle and meditative soul, his own, by the war. For, in reality, like  so many Italian writers, Panzini is autobiographical in everything that  he writes. In this book he has shown more insight of feminine psychology  than in any of his other writings, though he is more successful with  Donna Barberina, who represents modern Italian emotional repressions,  than with the English governess, Miss Edith, who forecasts in a timid  way what her countrywomen have obtained. Nevertheless, the strength of  the story is the evolution of the moral and intellectual nature of  Aquilino, to whom the reader is partial from the first page, and Count  Hypolyte, who is \"too good to be true.\" Aquilino is what Alfredo Panzini  would have been had he encountered Conte Ippolito in his early youth.  The reader who makes his acquaintance identifies him with the future  glory of Italy, the type of youth who has no facilitation to success  save ideals and integrity.    Many of his short stories--such as \"Novelle d'Ambo i Sessi\" (\"Stories of  Both Sexes\"), \"Le Chicche di Noretta\" (\"The Gewgaws of Little  Nora\")--have elicited great praise. To-day Panzini has the reputation of  being one of the most gifted writers of Italy. He has come to his  patrimony very slowly. Without being in the smallest way like George  Meredith or Henry James, his writings have experienced a reception  similar to theirs in so far as it has been said of them that they are  hard to understand. It is difficult for a foreigner to give weight to  this accusation. The reader who once gets a familiarity with them  becomes an enthusiast. To him Panzini is one of the most readable of all  Italian writers. To be sure, if one reads \"Xantippe\" it is to be  expected that more or less will be said about Socrates and about the  customs and habits of Athens of that day. The same is true of Diogenes  and his lantern. It is also likely that when a man of literary training  and taste wanders about the country, writing of his encounters, he will  be likely to write of people and things, which, when others read them,  will presuppose a certain culture, but the reader who has the misfortune  to lack it need not hesitate to read the books of Signor Panzini. He  will have a certain degree of it after he has read them and he will get  possessed of it without effort. It is not at all unlikely that Signor  Panzini writes his stories and novels in much the same way as he writes  his dictionaries, namely, laboriously. His later writings have some  indication of having been thrown off in a white heat of creative passion  without preparation or conscious premeditation, but most of his books  bear the hallmarks of careful planning, methodical execution,  painstaking revision, and careful survey after completion that the  writer may be sure that his creation exposed to the gaze and criticism  of his fellow beings shall be as perfect as he can make it both from his  own knowledge and from the knowledge of others assimilated and  integrated by him.    The position which Panzini holds in the Italian world of letters to-day  is the index of the protest against the writings of D'Annunzio. Panzini  is sane, normal, human, gentle, kindly. He sees the facts of life as  they are; he fears the ascendancy of materialism; his hopes are that  man's evolutionary progress shall be spiritual, and he does not  anticipate the advent of a few supermen who shall administer the affairs  of the planet.    Alfredo Panzini may finally get a place in Italian letters comparable to  that of Pascoli, and should his call to permanent happiness be delayed  until he has achieved the days allotted by the psalmist he is likely to  have the position in Italian letters which Joseph Conrad has in English  letters to-day. This statement is not tantamount to an admission that it  is to writers like Panzini that we are to look for new developments in  imaginative literature. They will be found rather amongst a group of  writers who are the very antithesis of him--the Futurists.    The successor to the literary fame of Giacosa is Luigi Pirandello,  another schoolmaster. His earlier writings were cast as romances, but  latterly he has confined himself largely to stage-pieces which reflect  our moralities, satirize our conventions, and lampoon our hypocrisies.  His diction is idiomatic and telling. It reminds of de Maupassant and of  Bernard Shaw. Either he inherited an unusual capacity for verbal  expression or he has cultivated it assiduously.    He is Panzini's junior by three years, having been born in Girgenti,  June 28, 1867. His father was an exporter of sulphur, and his early life  was spent amongst the simple, passionate, emotional, tradition-loving  people of southern Sicily. Unlike his fellow Sicilians, Verga and  Capuana, he has not utilized them to any considerable degree as the  mouthpiece of his satiric comments and reflections on social life. He  has taken the more sophisticated if less appealing people of northern  and central Italy, and puts them in situations from which they extricate  themselves or get themselves more hopelessly entangled for the reader's  amusement or edification. In his last comedy, \"L'uomo, la Bestia, e la  Virtu\" (\"Man, Beast, and Virtue\"), the scene is laid \"in a city on the  sea, it doesn't matter where,\" yet the characters are typically  Sicilian.    After graduating from the University of Rome, Pirandello studied at Bonn  and made some translations of Goethe's \"Roman Elegies.\" Soon after he  returned to Rome he published a book of verse and a book of short  stories which made no particular stir. It was not until he published \"Il  fu Mattia Pascal\" (\"The Late Mattias Pascal\") that he obtained any real  success. Critics consider it still his best effort in the field of  romance.

Father, Calahorra shall remain to Don Fernando, and  I shall have another claim on Ximena for her love. Let God put me front  to front with Martin Gonzalez, in order that my sword may cause to bite  the dust the only man I hate in this world, now that De Gormaz is  dead--a man whom Ximena also abhors.\"    \"Yes, my son,\" replied Diego, participating in the delight of his son,  both on account of the honours which both of them had received from the  king, and the enterprise which had been entrusted to Rodrigo, in which  he was likely to gain still further glory. \"Yes, you shall fight for  your king and for your love, and you shall conquer; do not doubt of it,  Rodrigo. To-morrow we shall return to the court, where happier days  await us than those which we recently experienced in it.\"    Thus speaking, both parents embraced their son, for Teresa also shared  in the satisfaction of her husband and Rodrigo. The latter, indeed, was  about to engage in a fight in which one of the combatants was almost  certain to lose his life, but Teresa trusted in the valour of her son,  and at that period the sentiment of honour was superior to all  affections, to all fears, to all interests. Then the mother who most  loved her son was the very one who most ardently desired to see him  engaged in some honourable and hazardous enterprise, even though the  chances of gaining honour were less than those of losing life.    The reader, who doubtless remembers the interview between Ximena and  Rodrigo in the halls of the Alcazar, will also remember the fears which  both of them entertained, that Don Gome might bestow the hand of his  daughter on another man. Let us see if such fears were well founded.    Before the battle of Atapuerca, and when enmity was commencing between  Diego Lainez and Don Gome, the latter was sent to the court of Aragon,  in reality as the ambassador of Don Fernando, but he imagined that it  was a kind of exile, brought about by the artifices of De Vivar. Martin  Gonzalez, who was one of the most powerful grandees of Aragon, gave him  hospitality in his mansion, and entertained him magnificently,  apparently for no reason but to return the marks of friendship which he  had received from the count, some time before, at Gormaz, where he had  been at the celebration of a tournament, in which were engaged both  Castilian and Aragonian knights. Martin then saw Ximena, and was charmed  with her beauty and prudence; but he did not demand her hand, believing  that it would not be accorded to him, as he was aware that it had been  promised to Rodrigo. However, whilst Don Gome was enjoying his  hospitality, Martin Gonzalez discovered the recent bitter feelings which  he entertained towards De Vivar, and he believed that the time had  arrived for winning what he so ardently desired. He fanned the flames of  discord between Diego Lainez and Don Gome, strengthening by means of  calumny the belief which the latter entertained, that he owed his  disfavour at the court to the artifices of De Vivar. Then, when he had  sufficiently worked on the mind of Don Gome, he asked him for the hand  of Ximena, which was granted, on condition, however, that she should be  in no way forced to grant it against her will, for, with all his faults,  De Gormaz, as we have said before, loved his daughter, and, although he  had then resolved that she should not marry Rodrigo, he did not intend  that she should become the wife of another, except with her own free  consent. These infamous schemes, which were the principal causes of the  division between the two families, were known to Ximena and to Rodrigo,  and that is why they both entertained a deep hatred towards Martin  Gonzalez, and certainly that hatred was legitimate and just.    We do not wish to leave the castle of Vivar without knowing the  condition of affairs between the squire and his two sweethearts, for  which reason we shall enter a chamber, which must be that of Fernan, for  he is in it, and a lance and other instruments belonging to his  profession are suspended on its walls.    The valiant squire must be in very low spirits, for when he is not so he  talks, when in company, as much as four, or if alone, sings ballads of  love or chivalry; but now he is silent, with his head bent down, as if  buried in deep and disagreeable thought. Another servitor, however,  enters the apartment, and from his words we shall perchance learn  something of that which we desire to know.    \"On my soul,\" said the page, for such he was, \"you are now just as much  what you used to be as I am a bishop. What are you doing with your head  sunk on your breast, and so miserable, when such glad news has come to  our lords and masters?\"    \"Tell me, then, Alvar, what news have come?\"    \"I will tell you willingly as much as I know. I swear that the tidings  must be good--and so good that my masters gave the messengers who  brought them presents so valuable, that if they are not worth at least  more than a hundred ounces of good silver, may the saints forsake me at  the hour of my death!\"    \"But will you not tell me, accursed chatterer that you are, what the  news is which the messenger has brought?\"    \"Yes, Fernan, I will, and I am just coming to it. But what good has it  done you to visit so often the witch of the torrent, if you have not yet  learned to know things beforehand, an art in which people say she  excels?\"    \"I vow by Judas Iscariot that I'll throw you out of the window if you  don't cease talking such nonsense, and get out of this at once.\"    Alvar stepped backwards on seeing the threatening gesture of the  impatient squire, for he knew that it was the habit of Fernan to  accompany his words with acts, to which his ribs, almost broken more  than once by the squire, could testify. As the reader has already  perceived, the page was one of those young men who are so fond of  circumlocutions that they go to the grain, as sparrows, through the  straw. We have corresponding types in our own times, as may be often  seen in meetings of Parliament, in which is often heard the cry, \"To the  grain, to the grain!\" or \"Question, question,\" which is the same thing.    Thanks, then, to the threats of Fernan, the page related, without any  more roundabout expressions, what had brought the messenger of Don  Fernando; adding, as we already know, that both Diego and Rodrigo had  decided to set out for the court on the following day.    \"I am much pleased to hear that,\" said Fernan, \"for my life at Vivar is  but a lingering death, since that ungrateful Mayorica repays my love  with scratches and insults, and that vixen of an Aldonza shuts the door  in my face.\"    \"Then you love them, Fernan?\" said the page, much surprised.    \"And I must love them, I fear, in spite of the fact that they treat me  worse than a captive Moor.\"    \"By the soul of my grandfather, he who goes on in that way deserves a  hundred lashes. Oh, how vain are the intentions of lovers! Why don't you  swear, you unfortunate man, that as long as you live you'll have nothing  more to do with women?\"    \"What do you desire, Alvar? Man proposes and woman disposes. I was born  with such weaknesses, and I fear that I shall die with them.\"    \"Conquer these inclinations of yours, Fernan.\"    \"It's not easy to do that. However, I swear to you, friend Alvar, that  my eyes are opened with regard to the fair sex, and I'll do my best to  be done with them from this time forward.\"    \"If you don't do so soon, I tell you again, as I have already said, that  you will deserve a hundred good lashes.\"    \"It is easily seen, Alvar, that you have no heart. You never knew, and  don't know now, what love is.\"    \"Alas!\" said the page, heaving a deep sigh; \"I know it but too well,  friend Fernan. If we carried our hearts on our foreheads, you would see  mine, and it would move you to compassion.\"    \"By Judas Iscariot! what do you tell me, friend Alvar? You in love?\"    \"Don't be surprised, Fernan, for one should be made of stone not to  fall in love with the tyrannical and gentle maiden for whom I sigh.\"    \"Tell me, who is this sovereign beauty?\"    \"Yes, I will tell you, Fernan. You and your master brought her to  Vivar\"--    \"Explain quickly what you mean!\" exclaimed the squire, becoming suddenly  very angry again.    \"I tell you,\" hastened to answer Alvar, fearing the look of Fernan,  \"that Beatrice, the maiden whom you and Don Rodrigo rescued at the inn,  has me almost dead with love.\"    \"You will soon be dead by my hands!\" cried the squire, rushing at the  page and furiously seizing him by the throat. \"What is that you dare to  say, ill-born lout? You in love with Beatrice! you dare to place your  eyes where I have fixed mine!\"    \"Fernan, Fernan, let me loose! you are choking me with your hands of  iron! If I had known that you were in love with her, I should have had  no more thought of loving her than of turning Moor.\"    Fernan let go the page, feeling convinced that he had set his eyes on  Beatrice, not knowing that doing so would offend him.    \"Yes, I love her,\" said the squire; \"and, except my master, no one has  any right to interfere with me, for my lance made the fellows that were  carrying her off bite the dust. Although up to the present she has  showed herself insensible to my prayers, she shall learn how worthy I am  of serving her, and will yield to me, so that I may requite myself for  the cruelty of Mayorica.\"    The page found it hard to give up the conquest of the maiden who had  been rescued from Don Suero, but he found the hands of Fernan harder;  for that reason he promised him solemnly that he would not expose  himself again to his anger by paying attentions to Beatrice. The thrice  enamoured squire was satisfied with this, and both continued to converse  amiably, when they heard some persons exclaim in an adjacent room--    \"Father!\"    \"Daughter of my soul!\"    To these"]]]
