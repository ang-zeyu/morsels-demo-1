One knows by this that she can now  do greater work than she has done or is doing;\" so says one writer.    Is it not a beautiful thought that this feeling, which we have  supposed we must fight as something low, is in reality the stirring of  a divine impulse which we can control and govern and make to serve us  in all high and noble deeds?    If you hold such noble thoughts in your heart concerning yourself, you  will need no threatenings to keep you from self-debasement and  self-defilement. You will not need to be told of the loss of physical  strength or of beauty, of memory or of reason, through evil habits of  solitary vice, for they will have no temptation for you, even as you  do not need threats of police and prisons to keep you from stealing,  because honesty is the active and guiding principle of your life.    But supposing you have already acquired the evil habit and are now  awakened to the wrong you are doing yourself; you observe the lack of  lustre in the eye, the sallow, blotched complexion; you realize your  loss of nerve-power manifested in cold and clammy hands, backache,  lassitude, irritability, lack of memory, and inability to concentrate  thought. What shall you do to overcome and to gain control of  yourself? The question is a serious one, for no habit is more  tyrannical than the dominion of unrestrained sexual desire. Its  victims often fight for years, only to be conquered at last. If there  was no cure but in fighting, I should feel that the case was almost  hopeless.    The very first thing to do is to change the mental attitude in regard  to the whole matter of sex; to hold it in thought as sacred, holy,  consecrated to the highest of all functions, that of procreation.  Recognize that, conserved and controlled, it becomes a source of  energy to the individual. Cleanse the mind of all polluting images by  substituting this purer thought; then go to work to establish correct  habits of living in dress, diet, exercise, etc. See to it that there  are no such causes of pelvic congestions as prolapsed bowels, caused  by tight clothing or constipation; keep the skin active; and, above  all, keep the mind healthfully occupied.    The victim of self-abuse has, through the frequent repetition of the  habit, built up an undue amount of brain that is sensitive to local  irritation of the sex-organs or to mental pictures of sex-pleasure.  She must now allow this part of the brain to become quiescent, and she  should go to work to build up other brain centers. Let her train her  sight by close observation of form, color, size, location. Let her  cultivate her sense of hearing in the study of different qualities of  sound, tone, pitch, intensity, duration, timbre; her sense of touch,  by learning to judge with closed eyes of different materials, of  quality of fiber, of the different degrees of temperature, of  roughness or smoothness, of density; in fact, let her endeavor to  become alert, observant, along all the lines of sense-perception. Let  her study nature, leaf-forms, cloud-shapes, insects, flowers, birds,  bird-songs, the causes of natural phenomena; and, above all, let her  keep out of the realm of the artificial, the sentimental, the  emotional, and, holding firmly to the thought that creative energy is  symbolized by desire and can be dignified and consecrated to noblest  purposes, she will find herself daily growing into a stronger, more  beautiful self-control.          CHAPTER XX.    BE GOOD TO YOURSELF.      I witnessed the other day a parting between two men. The elder, as he  took the younger by the hand, said, \"Good-by, my boy; be good to  yourself;\" and the younger responded, heartily, \"Oh, there is no  danger but I'll be that.\" I wondered, as I saw the laughing face, so  full of the indications of the love of pleasure, if he really would be  good to himself, or if he would interpret it to mean to indulge  himself in all kinds of sensuous gratification. It is a great thing to  be truly good to one's self, and I would give the injunction with the  highest ideal. Be good to your real self with that true goodness that  sees the end from the beginning, that realizes the tendency of certain  forms of pleasure, and that claims the privilege of being master of  the senses, and not their slave.    \"Well,\" you say, rather deprecatingly, \"you can't expect young people  to act as staid and wise as you old folks. We want some fun.\" So you  do, and that is perfectly right. You should want fun and have fun. All  I ask is that you shall try to understand what real, true fun is.    I have seen young folks pull the chair from under some one \"for fun,\"  and the result was pain and perhaps permanent injury to the object of  the joke.    I have known young men to imagine they were having \"fun\" when they  went on a spree, to get \"gloriously drunk,\" as they phrased it. You  can see no fun in this. You realize that it is a most serious tragedy,  with not an element of real fun in it, involving, as it does, the loss  of health, the risking of life, the possibility of crime, the  heart-break of friends, and perhaps even death. It is altogether a  wrong idea of fun.    I have known girls in the secrecy of their rooms to smoke cigarettes  \"for fun,\" and in that I am sure that you see no amusement. It was a  lowering of the standard of womanhood; it was tampering with a poison;  it was something to be ashamed of, rather than something to call fun.    I have known young men and women to enter into flirtations \"for fun.\"  I knew a girl whose chief delight seemed to be in getting young men in  love with her, only to cast them aside when tired of their adoration.  She called this fun, but it was cruelty. In olden times men amused  themselves by throwing Christians to wild beasts and watching them  while being torn to pieces. This was their idea of fun, and the  flirt's idea of amusement seems to be of the same order. She plays  with the man as the cat with the mouse, and experiences no pangs of  conscience when, torn and bleeding in heart, she tosses him aside for  a new victim.    There are other young people who would not enter into such serious  flirtations, and yet are unduly familiar with each other. They mean  nothing by their endearments and familiarities, and neither will  suffer any pangs when the pleasant intimacy is ended. Can we not call  this innocent fun? They have indulged in some unobserved  hand-pressures, or a few stolen kisses; but neither believed the other  to mean anything serious. It was only fun; what harm could there be in  that?    Many girls to-day are reasoning thus, and many of these may pass  through the experience without loss of reputation; they may  subsequently marry honorably, and become respected and beloved  mothers. But ask any of these girls, in her mature years, when her own  daughters are growing up around her, if she wants them to pass through  the same experiences. I once knew a beautiful young woman who thought  it was fun to have these familiar intimacies with young men, because,  as she said, she knew how far to go. I saw her in her maturity, with  daughters of her own, and heard her say that when she recalled her own  girlish escapades, even in the darkness of the night the blushes would  rush over her from head to foot, and in heartfelt agony she would say  to herself, \"Oh, I wonder if my girls will ever do so?\"    It was fun to her in her girlhood; it was shame to her in her mature  remembrance; it was agony when she saw it possible to her own  children.    True fun is fun in anticipation, fun in realization, fun in  retrospection, and fun in seeing it repeated by succeeding  generations. If it fails to be fun in any of these instances, it fails  to be genuine.    I like to see young people full of vivacity. I like to hear their  merry laughter, to witness their innocent pranks; but I do not like to  see them laughing at the sufferings of others, or amusing themselves  with dangers of any kind. Above all, I regret to see them playing with  the fire of physical passion.    Many a girl who to-day is lost to virtue had no idea that she was  starting on this downward road. She was only having a good time. She  was pretty, attractive, and admired. Young men flattered her with  words, and when they held her hand, or put their arm around her, she  took it as another compliment to her charms. She did not see that it  was only selfishness, only a desire to feel the thrills of physical  pleasure which this contact with her person aroused. She would have  felt humiliated had she recognized this fact, and it seems to me that  girls should understand the feelings that prompt young men to take  personal familiarities.    The young man might deny the fact to the girl, but he understands it  well enough as a fact, and he loses a measure of respect for her  because she is willing to permit his advances. The girl no doubt  imagines that these are sweet little secrets between herself and the  young man, when perhaps he is discussing her openly with his young men  friends. I have even heard such discussions on railway trains, carried  on in no very low tones, between young men, well dressed and with all  the outward appearances of gentlemen, and I have wondered how Jennie  and Sadie and Clara and Nellie, whose names I heard openly mentioned,  would have felt to have heard themselves described as \"a nice, soft  little thing to hug,\" or \"she knows how to kiss.\"    Do you imagine these young men would have thus spoken had they truly  respected the girls? They might say \"They are nice girls,\" but would  they say, in their deeper consciousness, \"They are true,  self-respecting, womanly girls, and I honor them?\"    \"But what is a girl to do?\" asks one. \"If she is prudish she won't get  any attention. She has to allow a certain innocent freedom, or young  men won't go with her.\"    Do you really"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#19)"],[1," of Xisuthrus's or Noah's sons, from thence  first made.

B. II. ch. 10., and about which our late writers  seem very much unconcerned; viz. that it was a war of that consequence,  as to occasion the removal or destruction of six or seven nations of the  posterity of Mitzraim, with their cities; which Josephus would not have  said, if he had not had ancient records to justify those his assertions,  though those records be now all lost.]      18 (return) [ That the Jews were called Hebrews from this their  progenitor Heber, our author Josephus here rightly affirms; and not from  Abram the Hebrew, or passenger over Euphrates, as many of the moderns  suppose. Shem is also called the father of all the children of Heber, or  of all the Hebrews, in a history long before Abram passed over  Euphrates, Genesis 10:21, though it must be confessed that, Genesis  14:13, where the original says they told Abram the Hebrew, the  Septuagint renders it the passenger, [GREEK]: but this is spoken only of  Abram himself, who had then lately passed over Euphrates, and is another  signification of the Hebrew word, taken as an appellative, and not as a  proper name.]      19 (return) [ It is worth noting here, that God required no other  sacrifices under the law of Moses, than what were taken from these five  kinds of animals which he here required of Abram. Nor did the Jews feed  upon any other domestic animals than the three here named, as Reland  observes on Antiq. B. IV. ch. 4. sect. 4.]      20 (return) [ As to this affliction of Abram's posterity for 400 years,  see Antiq. B. II. ch. 9. sect. 1.]      21 (return) [ These sons-in-law to Lot, as they are called, Genesis  19:12-14, might be so styled, because they were betrothed to Lot's  daughters, though not yet married to them.

That it was standing then is also  attested by Clement of Rome, contemporary with Josephus; as also that it  was so in the next century, is attested by Irenaeus, with the addition  of an hypothesis, how it came to last so long, with all its members  entire.Whether the account that some modern travelers give be true,  that it is still standing, I do not know. Its remote situation, at the  most southern point of the Sea of Sodom, in the wild and dangerous  deserts of Arabia, makes it exceeding difficult for inquisitive  travelers to examine the place; and for common reports of country  people, at a distance, they are not very satisfactory. In the mean time,  I have no opinion of Le Clerc's dissertation or hypothesis about this  question, which can only be determined by eye-witnesses. When Christian  princes, so called, lay aside their foolish and unchristian wars and  quarrels, and send a body of fit persons to travel over the east, and  bring us faithful accounts of all ancient monuments, and procure us  copies of all ancient records, at present lost among us, we may hope for  full satisfaction in such inquiries; but hardly before.]      24 (return) [ I see no proper wicked intention in these daughters of  Lot, when in a case which appeared to them of unavoidable necessity,  they procured themselves to be with child by their father. Without such  an unavoidable necessity, incest is a horrid crime; but whether in such  a case of necessity, as they apprehended this to be, according to  Josephus, it was any such crime, I am not satisfied. In the mean time,  their making their father drunk, and their solicitous concealment of  what they did from him, shows that they despaired of persuading him to  an action which, at the best, could not but be very suspicious and  shocking to so good a man.]      25 (return) [ It is well worth observation, that Josephus here calls  that principal Angel, who appeared to Abraham and foretold the birth of  Isaac, directly God; which language of Josephus here, prepares us to  believe those other expressions of his, that Jesus was a wise man, if it  be lawful to call him a man, Antiq. B. XVIII. ch. 3. sect. 3, and of God  the Word, in his homily concerning Hades, may be both genuine. Nor is  the other expression of Divine Angel, used presently, and before, also  of any other signification.]      26 (return) [ Josephus here calls Ismael a young child or infant, though  he was about 13 years of age; as Judas calls himself and his brethren  young men, when he was 47, and had two children, Antiq. B. II. ch. 6.  sect. 8, and they were of much the same age; as is a damsel of 12 years  old called a little child, Mark 5:39-42, five several times. Herod is  also said by Josephus to be a very young man at 25. See the note on  Antiq. B. XIV. ch. 9. sect 2, and of the War, B. I. ch. 10. And  Aristobulus is styled a very little child at 16 years of age, Antiq. B.  XV. ch. 2. sect. 6, 7. Domitian also is called by him a very young  child, when he went on his German expedition at about 18 years of age,  of the War, B. VII. ch. 4. sect. 2. Samson's wife, and Ruth, when they  were widows, are called children, Antiq. B. V. ch. 8. sect. 6, and ch.  9. sect. 2 3.]      27 (return) [ Note, that both here and Hebrews 11:17, Isaac is called  Abraham's only begotten son, though he at the same time had another son,  Ismael. The Septuagint expresses the true meaning, by rendering the text  the beloved son.]      28 (return) [ Here is a plain error in the copies which say that king  David afterwards built the temple on this Mount Moriah, while it was  certainly no other than king Solomon who built that temple, as indeed  Procopius cites it from Josephus. For it was for certain David, and not  Solomon, who built the first altar there, as we learn, 2 Samuel 24:18,  etc.; 1 Chronicles 21:22, etc.; and Antiq. B. VII. ch. 13. sect. 4.]      29 (return) [ It seems both here, and in God's parallel blessing to  Jacob, ch. 19. sect. 1, that Josephus had yet no notion of the hidden  meaning of that most important and most eminent promise, \"In thy seed  shall all the families of the earth be blessed. He saith not, and of  seeds, as of many, but as of one; and to thy seed, which is Christ,\"  Galatians 3:16. Nor is it any wonder, he being, I think, as yet not a  Christian. And had he been a Christian, yet since he was, to be sure,  till the latter part of his life, no more than an Ebionite Christian,  who, above all the apostles, rejected and despised St. Paul, it would be  no great wonder if he did not now follow his interpretation. In the mean  time, we have in effect St. Paul's exposition in the Testament of  Reuben, sect. 6, in Authent. Rec. Part I. p. 302, who charges his sons  \"to worship the seed of Judah, who should die for them in visible and  invisible wars; and should be among them an eternal king.\" Nor is that  observation of a learned foreigner of my acquaintance to be despised,  who takes notice, that as seeds in the plural, must signify posterity,  so seed in the singular may signify either posterity, or a single  person; and that in this promise of all nations being happy in the seed  of Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob, etc., it is always used in the singular.  To which I shall add, that it is sometimes, as it were, paraphrased by  the son of Abraham, the son of David, etc., which is capable of no such  ambiguity.]      30 (return) [ The birth of Jacob and Esau is here said to be after  Abraham's death: it should have been after Sarah's death. The order of  the narration in Genesis, not always exactly according to the order of  time, seems to have led Josephus into this error, as Dr. Bernard  observes here.]      31 (return) [ For Seir in Josephus, the coherence requires that we read  Esau or Seir, which signify the same thing.]      32 (return) [ The supper of savory meat, as we call it, Genesis 27:4, to  be caught by hunting, was intended plainly for a festival or a  sacrifice; and upon the prayers that were frequent at sacrifices, Isaac  expected, as was then usual in such eminent cases, that a divine impulse  would come upon him, in order to the blessing of his son there present,  and his foretelling his future behavior and fortune. Whence it must be,  that when Isaac had unwittingly blessed Jacob, and was afterwards made  sensible of his mistake, yet did he not attempt to alter it, how  earnestly soever his affection for Esau might incline him to wish it  might be altered, because he knew that this blessing came not from  himself, but from God, and that an alteration was out of his power. A  second afflatus then came upon him, and enabled him to foretell Esau's  future behavior and foretell Esau's future behavior and fortune also.]      33 (return) [ Whether Jacob or his mother Rebeka were most blameable in  this imposition upon Isaac in his old age, I cannot determine. However  the blessing being delivered as a prediction of future events, by a  Divine impulse, and foretelling things to befall to the posterity of  Jacob and Esau in future ages, was for certain providential; and  according to what Rebeka knew to be the purpose of God, when he answered  her inquiry, \"before the children were born,\" Genesis 25:23, \"that one  people should be stronger than the other people; and the elder, Esau,  should serve the younger, Jacob.\" Whether Isaac knew or remembered this  old oracle, delivered in our copies only to Rebeka; or whether, if he  knew and remembered it, he did not endeavor to alter the Divine  determination,"]]]
