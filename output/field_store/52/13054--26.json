The motto humorously proposed for the new review  by its projector was, \"_Tenui musam meditamur avena,_\"--_i.e._, \"We  cultivate literature upon a little oatmeal;\" but this being too nearly  the truth to be publicly acknowledged, the more grave dictum of \"_Judex  damnatur cum nocens absolvitur_\" was adopted from _Publius Syrus_, of  whom, Sydney Smith affirms, \"None of us, I am sure, ever read a single  line!\" Lord Byron, in his fifth edition of _English Bards and Scotch  Reviewers_, refers to the reviewers as an \"oat-fed phalanx.\"           *       *       *       *       *      CLEVER STATESMEN.    However great talents may command the admiration of the world, they do  not generally best fit a man for the discharge of social duties. Swift  remarks that \"Men of great parts are often unfortunate in the management  of public business, because they are apt to go out of the common road  by the quickness of their imagination. This I once said to my Lord  Bolingbroke, and desired he would observe, that the clerk in his office  used a sort of ivory knife, with a blunt edge, to divide a sheet of  paper, which never failed to cut it even, only by requiring a steady  hand; whereas, if he should make one of a sharp penknife, the sharpness  would make it go often out of the crease, and disfigure the paper.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE FIRST MAGAZINE.    The _Gentleman's Magazine_ unaccountably passes for the earliest  periodical of that description; while, in fact, it was preceded nearly  forty years by the _Gentleman's Journal_ of Motteux, a work much more  closely resembling our modern magazines, and from which Sylvanus Urban  borrowed part of his title, and part of his motto; while on the first  page of the first number of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ itself, it is  stated to contain \"more than any book of the _kind_ and price.\"           *       *       *       *       *      MRS. TRIMMER.    This ingenious woman was the daughter of Joshua and Sarah Kirby, and was  born at Ipswich, January 6, 1741. Kirby taught George the Third, when  Prince of Wales, perspective and architecture. He was also President of  the Society of Artists of Great Britain, out of which grew the Royal  Academy. It was the last desire of Gainsborough to be buried beside his  old friend Kirby, and their tombs adjoin each other in the churchyard at  Kew.    Mrs. Trimmer, when a girl, was constantly reading Milton's _Paradise  Lost_; and this circumstance so pleased Dr. Johnson, that he invited her  to see him, and presented her with a copy of his _Rambler_. She also  repeatedly met Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Gregory, Sharp, Hogarth, and  Gainsborough, with all of whom her father was on terms of intimacy. Mrs.  Trimmer advocated religious education against the latitudinarian views  of Joseph Lancaster. It was at her persuasion that Dr. Bell entered the  field, and paved the way for the establishment of the National Society.  Mrs. Trimmer died, in her seventieth year, in 1810. She was seated at  her table reading a letter, when her head sunk upon her bosom, and she  \"fell asleep;\" and so gentle was the wafting, that she seemed for some  time in a refreshing slumber, which her family were unwilling to  interrupt.           *       *       *       *       *      BOSWELL'S BEAR-LEADING.    It was on a visit to the parliament house that Mr. Henry Erskine,  (brother of Lord Buchan and Lord Erskine,) after being presented to Dr.  Johnson by Mr. Boswell, and having made his bow, slipped a shilling  into Boswell's hand, whispering that it was for the sight of his  _bear_.--_Sir Walter Scott._           *       *       *       *       *      LORD ELIBANK AND DR. JOHNSON    Lord Elibank made a happy retort on Dr. Johnson's definition of oats, as  the food of horses in England, and men in Scotland. \"Yes,\" said he, \"and  where else will you see _such horses, and such men_?\"--_Sir Walter Scott._           *       *       *       *       *      RELICS OF DR. JOHNSON AT LICHFIELD.    The house in which Dr. Johnson was born, at Lichfield--where his father,  it is well known, kept a small bookseller's shop, and where he was  partly educated--stood on the west side of the market-place. In the  centre of the market-place is a colossal statue of Johnson, seated upon  a square pedestal: it is by Lucas, and was executed at the expense of  the Rev. Chancellor Law, in 1838. By the side of a footpath leading from  Dam-street to Stow, formerly stood a large willow, said to have been  planted by Johnson. It was blown down, in 1829; but one of its shoots  was preserved and planted upon the same spot: it was in the year 1848 a  large tree, known in the town as \"Johnson's Willow.\"    Mr. Lomax, who for many years kept a bookseller's shop--\"The Johnson's  Head,\" in Bird-street, Lichfield, possessed several articles that  formerly belonged to Johnson, which have been handed down by a clear and  indisputable ownership. Amongst them is his own _Book of Common Prayer_,  in which are written, in pencil, the four Latin lines printed in Strahan's  edition of the Doctor's Prayers. There are, also, a sacrament-book, with  Johnson's wife's name in it, in his own handwriting; an autograph letter  of the Doctor's to Miss Porter; two tea-spoons, an ivory tablet, and a  breakfast table; a Visscher's Atlas, paged by the Doctor, and a manuscript  index; Davies's _Life of Garrick_, presented to Johnson by the publisher;  a walking cane; and a Dictionary of Heathen Mythology, with the  Doctor's MS. corrections. His wife's wedding-ring, afterwards made into  a mourning-ring; and a massive chair, in which he customarily sat, were  also in Mr Lomax's possession.    Among the few persons living in the year 1848 who ever saw Dr. Johnson,  was Mr. Dyott, of Lichfield: this was seventy-four years before, or in  1774, when the Doctor and Boswell, on their tour into Wales, stopped at  Ashbourne, and there visited Mr. Dyott's father, who was then residing  at Ashbourne Hall.[9]     [9] \"The Dyotts,\" notes Croker, \"are a respectable and wealthy family,   still residing near Lichfield. The royalist who shot Lord Brooke when   assaulting St. Chad's Cathedral, in Lichfield, on St. Chad's Day, was   a Mr. Dyott.\"           *       *       *       *       *      COLERIDGE A SOLDIER.    After Coleridge left Cambridge, he came to London, where soon feeling  himself forlorn and destitute, he enlisted as a soldier in the 15th  Elliot's Light Dragoons. \"On his arrival at the quarters of the  regiment,\" says his friend and biographer, Mr. Gilman, \"the general of  the district inspected the recruits, and looking hard at Coleridge, with  a military air, inquired 'What's your name, sir?' 'Comberbach!' (the  name he had assumed.) 'What do you come here for, sir?' as if doubting  whether he had any business there. 'Sir,' said Coleridge, 'for what most  other persons come--to be made a soldier.' 'Do you think,' said the  general, 'you can run a Frenchman through the body?' 'I do not know,'  replied Coleridge, 'as I never tried; but I'll let a Frenchman run me  through the body before I'll run away.' 'That will do,' said the  general, and Coleridge was turned in the ranks.\"    The poet made a poor dragoon, and never advanced beyond the awkward  squad. He wrote letters, however, for all his comrades, and they  attended to his horse and accoutrements. After four months service,  (December 1793 to April 1794), the history and circumstances of  Coleridge became known. He had written under his saddle, on the stable  wall, a Latin sentence (Eheu! quam infortunii miserrimum est fuisse  felicem!) which led to an inquiry on the part of the captain of his  troop, who had more regard for the classics than Ensign Northerton, in  _Tom Jones_. Coleridge was, accordingly, discharged, and restored to his  family and friends.           *       *       *       *       *      COBBETT'S BOYHOOD.    Perhaps, in Cobbett's voluminous writings, there is nothing so complete  as the following picture of his boyish scenes and recollections: it has  been well compared to the most simple and touching passages in  Richardson's _Pamela_:--        \"After living within a hundred yards of Westminster Hall and the      Abbey church, and the bridge, and looking from my own window into      St. James's Park, all other buildings and spots appear mean and      insignificant. I went to-day to see the house I formerly occupied.      How small! It is always thus: the words large and small are      carried about with us in our minds, and we forget real dimensions.      The idea, such as it was received, remains during our absence from      the object. When I returned to England in 1800, after an absence      from the country parts of it of sixteen years, the trees, the      hedges, even the parks and woods, seemed so small! It made me      laugh to hear little gutters, that I could jump over, called      rivers! The Thames was but 'a creek!' But when, in about a month      after my arrival in London, I went to Farnham, the place of my      birth, what was my surprise! Every thing was become so pitifully      small! I had to cross in my postchaise the long and dreary heath      of Bagshot. Then, at the end of it, to mount a hill called Hungry      Hill; and from that hill I knew that I should look down into the      beautiful and fertile vale of Farnham. My heart fluttered with      impatience, mixed with a sort of fear, to see all the scenes of my      childhood; for I had learned before the death of my father and      mother. There is a hill not far from the town, called Crooksbury      Hill, which rises up out of a flat in the form of a cone, and is      planted with Scotch fir-trees. Here I used to take the eggs and      young ones of crows and magpies. This hill was a famous object in      the neighbourhood.

Under Governor Cornbury,  the English law was adopted and enforced, and the Quakers were  disqualified from testifying in court unless they took an oath and  were prohibited from serving on juries or holding any office of trust.  Cornbury's judges wore scarlet robes, powdered wigs, cocked hats,  gold lace, and side arms; they were conducted to the courthouse by the  sheriff's cavalcade and opened court with great parade and ceremony.  Such a spectacle of pomp was sufficient to divert the flow of Quaker  immigrants to Pennsylvania, where the government was entirely in Quaker  hands and where plain and serious ways gave promise of enduring and  unmolested prosperity.    The Quakers had altogether thirty meeting houses in West Jersey and  eleven in East Jersey, which probably shows about the proportion  of Quaker influence in the two Jerseys. Many of them have since  disappeared; some of the early buildings, to judge from the pictures,  were of wood and not particularly pleasing in appearance. They were  makeshifts, usually intended to be replaced by better buildings. Some  substantial brick buildings of excellent architecture have survived, and  their plainness and simplicity, combined with excellent proportions and  thorough construction, are clearly indicative of Quaker character. There  is a particularly interesting one in Salem with a magnificent old oak  beside it, another in the village of Greenwich on the Cohansey farther  south, and another at Crosswicks near Trenton.    In West Jersey near Mount Holly was born and lived John Woolman, a  Quaker who became eminent throughout the English speaking world for the  simplicity and loftiness of his religious thought as well as for his  admirable style of expression. His \"Journal,\" once greatly and even  extravagantly admired, still finds readers. \"Get the writings of John  Woolman by heart,\" said Charles Lamb, \"and love the early Quakers.\"  He was among the Quakers one of the first and perhaps the first really  earnest advocate of the abolition of slavery. The scenes of West Jersey  and the writings of Woolman seem to belong together. Possibly a feeling  for the simplicity of those scenes and their life led Walt Whitman, who  grew up on Long Island under Quaker influence, to spend his last years  at Camden, in West Jersey. His profound democracy, which was very  Quaker-like, was more at home there perhaps than anywhere else.        Chapter IX. Planters And Traders Of Southern Jersey    Most of the colonies in America, especially the stronger ones, had an  aristocratic class, which was often large and powerful, as in the case  of Virginia, and which usually centered around the governor, especially  if he were appointed from England by the Crown or by a proprietor. But  there was very little of this social distinction in New Jersey. Her  political life had been too much broken up, and she had been too long  dependent on the governors of New York to have any of those pretty  little aristocracies with bright colored clothes, and coaches and four,  flourishing within her boundaries. There seems to have been a faint  suggestion of such social pretensions under Governor Franklin just  before the Revolution. He was beginning to live down the objections to  his illegitimate birth and Toryism and by his entertainments and manner  of living was creating a social following. There is said also to have  been something a little like the beginning of an aristocracy among the  descendants of the Dutch settlers who had ancestral holdings near the  Hudson; but this amounted to very little.    Class distinctions were not so strongly marked in New Jersey as in some  other colonies. There grew up in southern Jersey, however, a sort of  aristocracy of gentlemen farmers, who owned large tracts of land and  lived in not a little style in good houses on the small streams.    The northern part of the province, largely settled and influenced by New  Englanders, was like New England a land of vigorous concentrated town  life and small farms. The hilly and mountainous nature of the northern  section naturally led to small holdings of land. But in southern Jersey  the level sandy tracts of forest were often taken up in large areas.  In the absence of manufacturing, large acreage naturally became, as in  Virginia and Maryland, the only mark of wealth and social distinction.  The great landlord was looked up to by the lesser fry. The Quaker rule  of discountenancing marrying out of meeting tended to keep a large  acreage in the family and to make it larger by marriage. A Quaker  of broad acres would seek for his daughter a young man of another  landholding Quaker family and would thus join the two estates.    There was a marked difference between East Jersey and West Jersey  in county organization. In West Jersey the people tended to become  planters; their farms and plantations somewhat like those of the far  South; and the political unit of government was the county. In East  Jersey the town was the starting point and the county marked the  boundaries of a collection of towns. This curious difference, the result  of soil, climate, and methods of life, shows itself in other States  wherever South and North meet. Illinois is an example, where the  southern part of the State is governed by the county system, and the  northern part by the town system.    The lumberman, too, in clearing off the primeval forest and selling the  timber, usually dealt in immense acreage. Some families, it is said, can  be traced steadily proceeding southward as they stripped off the forest,  and started sawmills and gristmills on the little streams that trickled  from the swamps, and like beavers making with their dams those pretty  ponds which modern lovers of the picturesque are now so eager to find. A  good deal of the lumbering in the interior pines tract was carried on  by persons who leased the premises from owners who lived on plantations  along the Delaware or its tributary streams. These operations began soon  after 1700. Wood roads were cut into the Pines, sawmills were started,  and constant use turned some of these wood roads into the highways of  modern times.    There was a speculative tinge in the operations of this landed  aristocracy. Like the old tobacco raising aristocracy of Virginia and  Maryland, they were inclined to go from tract to tract, skinning what  they could from a piece of deforested land and then seeking another  virgin tract. The roughest methods were used; wooden plows, brush  harrows, straw collars, grapevine harness, and poor shelter for animals  and crops; but were the Virginia methods any better? In these operations  there was apparently a good deal of sudden profit and mushroom  prosperity accompanied by a good deal of debt and insolvency. In this,  too, they were like the Virginians and Carolinians. There seem to have  been also a good many slaves in West Jersey, brought, as in the southern  colonies, to work on the large estates, and this also, no doubt, helped  to foster the aristocratic feeling.    The best days of the Jersey gentlemen farmers came probably when they  could no longer move from tract to tract. They settled down and enjoyed  a very plentiful, if rude, existence on the products of their land,  game, and fish, amid a fine climate--with mosquitoes enough in summer to  act as a counterirritant and prevent stagnation from too much ease and  prosperity. After the manner of colonial times, they wove their own  clothes from the wool of their own sheep and made their own implements,  furniture, and simple machinery.    There are still to be found fascinating traces of this old life in  out-of-the-way parts of southern Jersey. To run upon old houses among  the Jersey pines still stored with Latin classics and old editions of  Shakespeare, Addison, or Samuel Johnson, to come across an old mill  with its machinery, cogwheels, flywheels, and all, made of wood, to find  people who make their own oars, and the handles of their tools from  the materials furnished by their own forest, is now unfortunately a  refreshment of the spirit that is daily becoming rarer.    This condition of material and social self-sufficiency lasted in places  long after the Revolution. It was a curious little aristocracy--a very  faint and faded one, lacking the robustness of the far southern  type, and lacking indeed the real essential of an aristocracy, namely  political power. Moreover, although there were slaves in New Jersey,  there were not enough of them to exalt the Jersey gentlemen farmers into  such self-sufficient lords and masters as the Virginian and Carolinian  planters became.    To search out the remains of this stage of American history, however,  takes one up many pleasant streams flowing out of the forest tract  to the Delaware on one side or to the ocean on the other. This  topographical formation of a central ridge or watershed of forest and  swamp was a repetition of the same formation in the Delaware peninsula,  which like southern Jersey had originally been a shoal and then an  island. The Jersey watershed, with its streams abounding in wood duck  and all manner of wild life, must have been in its primeval days as  fascinating as some of the streams of the Florida cypress swamps. Toward  the ocean, Wading River, the Mullica, the Tuckahoe, Great Egg; and on  the Delaware side the Maurice, Cohansey, Salem Creek, Oldman's, Raccoon,  Mantua, Woodberry, Timber, and the Rancocas, still possess attraction.  Some of them, on opposite sides of the divide, are not far apart  at their sources in the old forest tract; so that a canoe can be  transported over the few miles and thus traverse the State.
