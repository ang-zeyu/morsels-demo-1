She would probably be a worthy, stolid, stayless lady with none of my  faults, and when he was fed up with her stolid staylessness he could  come back to me, and my very faults, you see, would be pleasing to him  by reason of their contrast to hers, and _vice versa_.'    'It's really a wonderful idea,' said Isolda, thoughtfully, 'I wonder no  one thought of it before. There would be fewer old maids, as men  wouldn't be so terribly shy of matrimony when they knew there would  always be that second chance. They wouldn't expect so much from one wife  as they do now. And think what a good effect it would have on our  manners, too--how kind and polite and self-controlled we would be, under  fear of being compared unfavourably with the other one.'    'Yes, it would certainly keep us all up to the mark,' reflected Miranda,  'slovenly wives would make an effort to be smart, and shrewish ones  would put a curb on their tongues. Husbands would be quite loverlike and  attentive, in their anxiety to outdo the other fellow.'    'It would smooth out the tangles all round,' declared Amoret; 'now just  take the cases known to us personally. The Fred Smiths, for instance,  haven't spoken to each other for three years, just because Fred fell in  love with Miss Brown and spends nearly all his time with her. Mrs Smith  is broken-hearted, Fred looks miserable enough--a home where no one  speaks to you must be simply Hades--and the Brown girl is always  threatening to commit suicide. The affair has quite spoilt her life, and  it must be very hard luck on the Smith children, growing up in such an  atmosphere. My plan would have done away with all this misery: Fred  could have married Miss Brown, and gone on living happily at intervals  with Mrs Smith.'    'But what would Mrs Smith do in the intervals? She happens to have found  no counter attraction.'    'Well, perhaps if duogamy had been the custom, she would have looked out  for one,' said Amoret, 'most married women could find one alternative,  I'm sure. But, any way, no plan is perfect, and there are lots of wives  who wouldn't want a second husband at all, and who would be only too  glad of a restful period, when no dinners need be ordered. Then take the  case of the Robinsons: Dick Jones adores Mrs Robinson and is utterly  wretched because he can only be a friend to her. She is very fond of  him, and fond of her husband too; she could make them both very happy if  they would share her.'    'I have often felt I could make two men happy,' said Isolda. 'Some of my  best points are wasted on Launcelot. Then, too, he never tires of the  country and his beloved golf, but I do, and when one of my fits of  London-longing were to come over me I'd just run up to town and have a  ripping time with my London husband.'    'Without feeling you were doing anything wrong,' supplemented Amoret,  whose apparent experience of the qualms of conscience struck me as being  rather suspicious.    'It's no good, girls,' said Miranda, suddenly. 'It's no good--duogamy's  off! Think of the servants!'    'Horrors, the servants!' said Isolda, blankly.    'Yes, I was afraid you would soon find out the one weak spot,' said  Amoret, regretfully. 'Of course it would be awful having to cope with  two lots of servants. One husband could afford to keep four or five,  say, and the other only one or two, and each lot would get out of hand  during the wife's absence.'    'So instead of having a perfectly deevy time with two husbands vying  with each other in pleasing one, one would have a fearsome existence  constantly breaking-in minions. Directly one had got A.'s servants into  order, it would be time to go back to B. and do the same there.'    'No; thank you,' said Isolda, firmly, 'one lot is enough for me. I've  said dozens of times, for the servant reason alone, that I wish I had  never married. It would be madness to actually double one's burden.  You can strike me off the list of duogamists, Amoret, until the Servant  Question is solved by some new invention of machinery, or the  importation of Chinese.'    'Perhaps,' Amoret suggested hopefully, 'your alternative might consent  to live in a hotel.'    'No such luck,' said Isolda, mournfully, 'when a man marries it's mostly  for a home--why else should he marry unless it's for the children? Good  gracious! I'd forgotten all about the children. Of course that  settles it.'    'The _cul-de-sac_ of all reforms!' said Amoret, tragically. 'It's  impossible to suggest any revision in the marriage system that isn't  instantly quashed by the children complication.'    We all sat silent, busy with our thoughts, and then Isolda shuddered.    'Duogamy's no good,' she said emphatically, 'and I _am_ so  disappointed!'            VII      THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PRELIMINARY CANTER      'Marriage is terrifying, but so is a cold and forlorn old age.'      --R. L. STEVENSON.      Of all the revolutionary suggestions for improving the present marriage  system, the most sensible and feasible seems to me marriage 'on  approval'--in other words, a 'preliminary canter.' The procedure would  be somewhat as follows: a couple on deciding to marry would go through a  legal form of contract, agreeing to take each other as husband and wife  for a limited term of years--say three. This period would allow two  years for a fair trial, after the abnormal and exceptionally trying  first year was over. Any shorter time would be insufficient. At the  conclusion of the three years, the contracting parties would have the  option of dissolving the marriage--the dissolution not to become  absolute for another six months, so as to allow every opportunity of  testing the genuineness of the desire to part. If no dissolution were  desired, the marriage would then be ratified by a religious or final  legal ceremony, and become permanently binding.    In the case of a marriage dissolved, each party would be free to wed  again; but the second essay must be final and permanent from the start.  This restriction would be absolutely necessary if the preliminary canter  plan is not to degenerate into a species of legalised free love, as  there are many men, and some women, who would 'always go on cantering,'  as Amoret expressed it once--and the upshot would be nothing less than  leasehold marriage for the short term of three years.    It might be urged against this plan that many couples who come to grief  in the danger zone of married life--_i.e._ nearing the tenth year--are  perfectly happy in the early years. But human love being as mutable as  it is, and people and conditions being so liable to change, it is  impossible to arrive at any permanent marriage system which allows for  this. It must, however, be remembered that, in the majority of unhappy  unions, it is not the system, but the individuals who are to blame. The  institution of the conjugal novitiate would, however, reduce the number  of divorces considerably, by making less possible the miserable misfits  in temperament now so prevalent. It would give a second chance to those  who had made a mistake, yet without resulting in that promiscuity of  intercourse which is a danger to society and fatal to the best interests  of the race. Of what other scheme can the same be said?    For married women in the novitiate period a new prefix would have to be  invented, which they would retain if the union were dissolved. _Mrs_  would be the distinguishing prefix of women who had entered on the final  and permanent state of matrimony. Whether the wife would take the  husband's surname during the probationary term would be another question  for decision by the majority; I should incline to her retaining her  maiden name with the aforesaid prefix, and only assuming that of the  husband with the Mrs of finality. But these are mere details.    As regards the important question of the children, the issue of a  probationary union would, of course, be legitimate, but I think wise  people would see to it that no children were born to them until the  marriage had been finally ratified. Certainly children would be the  exception rather than the rule, but the question of their custody in the  case of dissolved marriages would be one requiring the most thoughtful  legislation. To divide the child's time between the parents is an  undesirable expedient, and one that must to a certain extent be harmful,  since a settled existence and routine is so essential for children's  well-being. Yet to deprive the father of them altogether is equally  undesirable.    The conjugal novitiate is not a new scheme. It was practised prior to  the Reformation in Scotland under the name of 'hand-fasting.' The  parties met at the annual fairs, and by the ceremony of joining hands  declared themselves man and wife for a year. On the anniversary of this  function they were legally married by a priest--if all had gone well  with them. If they had found the union a failure they parted.

Shape as roses on a buttered tin sheet, brush over lightly  with egg slightly beaten and diluted with one tablespoon milk, and brown  delicately in oven.    TO SHAPE ROSES    Fill pastry bag with potato mixture. Hold the bag upright with tube  pointing downward. Guide tube with left hand and press out potato with  the right, making a circular motion. When roses are the desired size  press the tube gently into mixture and withdraw it quickly to stop the  flow and give the pyramid a pointed finish. Sweet potatoes may be  prepared in the same manner.      CORN FRITTERS    (For recipe see Page 63.)

Pour over one and  one-half cups Bechamel Sauce (see Page 85). Sprinkle with finely chopped  parsley.      DRESSED HEAD LETTUCE    Select a large, firm head of lettuce. Remove all wilted leaves. Separate  the heart leaves sufficiently to wash them thoroughly. Drain, arrange  leaves on shallow serving plate, keeping them in their original shape if  possible. Sprinkle over all finely shredded red and green prepared  peppers. (To prepare peppers, plunge them into boiling water, then  quickly rub off the glazed outer skin, drop peppers into cold water  until crisp. Cut a slice from the stem ends, remove seeds and veins,  then cut in thread like rings.) Serve with French Dressing, to which add  one tablespoon Roquefort cheese. Blend well before pouring over Salad.      BLACKBERRY ROLY-POLY              2 cups blackberries.            1/4 cup water.            1 cup sugar.            1/4 teaspoon salt.            2 cups pastry flour.            4 teaspoons baking powder.            1/2 teaspoon salt.            4 tablespoons Cottolene.

Rub  through a sieve and add sugar to pulp; return to range and cook until  mixture thickens, stirring occasionally. Sift flour with baking powder  and salt, work in Cottolene with tips of fingers, and mix to a soft  dough with yolk of egg mixed with one-half cup of milk. Turn onto a  floured board, knead slightly and roll out in a rectangular sheet  one-fourth inch thick. Divide this into four pieces, longer than wide.  Spread each with the blackberry sauce and roll up like jelly roll; wet  the edges, press lightly to prevent unrolling. Lay on buttered sheet and  brush tops with white of egg, sprinkle with sugar and a few grains  cloves. Bake twenty-five minutes in a hot oven. Serve hot with remaining  sauce kept hot over hot water or with    CREAMY SAUCE              1/4 cup butter.            2/3 cup powdered sugar.            2 tablespoons milk.            2 tablespoons Sherry wine.            Few grains nutmeg.    PROCESS: Cream butter, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly, add  milk and wine very slowly, continue beating. Add a sprinkle of nutmeg.  To avoid having sauce curdle, milk and wine must be added drop by drop.
