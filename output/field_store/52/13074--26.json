If  then a male is to attain a full measure of success it must be capable  of keeping its boundaries intact up to the time when the young are able  to fend for themselves, and consequently it is important that its  intolerant nature should remain susceptible to stimulation throughout  the greater part of the season.    Does the presence of a female serve to promote this end? Now we know  very little of the influence exerted by one sex upon the other.  Professor Lloyd Morgan has suggested that the male raises the emotional  tone of the female, a suggestion which seems to me in accordance with  the facts. There is reason to believe, however, that the converse is  also true--namely that the excitement of the male reaches a higher level  of intensity when a female is present. Granting then that his emotional  tone is raised, how will this affect the question? So great is the  difference of opinion as to the part that the emotions play in  furthering the life of the individual that one hesitates to accept any  particular one. But it seems to be generally admitted that emotion adds  to the efficacy of behaviour, and this is the view of Professor Lloyd  Morgan. \"Whatever may be the exact psychological nature of the emotions,  it may be regarded,\" he says, \"as certain that they introduce into the  conscious situation elements which contribute not a little to the energy  of behaviour. They are important conditions to vigorous and sustained  conation.\" Therefore, if it be true that the female raises the emotional  tone of the male, the result will be an increased flow of energy into  all the specific modes of behaviour connected with reproduction, amongst  which those directly concerned in the securing and defence of the  territory will receive their share; so that instead of a progressive  weakening of just those elements in the situation which make for  success, the level of their efficiency will be maintained as a result of  such reinforcement. But the female becomes intolerant of her own sex  when she has discovered a male ready to breed, and, later, assists her  mate in resisting intrusion; and by raising her emotional tone, he may  be the means of furthering more strenuous behaviour on her part. Each  member of the pair would in this way contribute towards the energy of  behaviour of its mate, and hence add indirectly to the security of the  territory.    It may be well to illustrate the foregoing remarks. Suppose that there  is a small piece of woodland barely sufficient to hold three pairs of  Willow-Warblers, and suppose that the male and female in the middle  territory did not respond to one another's influence quite as readily as  the adjoining males and females, what would be the result? The emotional  tone of the central pair would stand at a lower level of intensity; and,  since their congenital dispositions would lack the necessary  reinforcement, the birds would tend to become less and less punctilious  in keeping their boundaries intact, whereas the adjoining pairs, always  on the alert and meeting with little opposition, would encroach more and  more and gradually extend their dominion. And so, by the time the young  were hatched, the parents would be in occupation of an area too limited  in extent to insure the necessarily rapid supply of food, and would be  compelled to intrude upon the adjoining ground. But knowing how routine  becomes ingrained in the life of the individual, knowing that for weeks  this pair had submitted to their neighbours, can we believe that they  would be capable of asserting their authority and that the young would  be properly cared for? Or suppose that different pairs of Kittiwake  Gulls on the crowded ledges, or different pairs of Puffins in the  crowded burrows, varied in like manner, would they all have equal  chances of rearing their offspring? The struggle for reproduction is  nowhere more severe than amongst the cliff-breeding sea birds; it is not  for nothing that one sees Kittiwake Gulls, locked together, fall into  the water hundreds of feet below and struggle to the point of  exhaustion, or, as has been reported, to the point of death; it is not  for nothing that Puffins fight with such desperation. And surely success  will be attained by that pair whose emotional tone stands high and whose  impulse to fight is therefore strong, rather than to the ill-assorted  couple.      The argument, then, is briefly this. In the spring, a marked change  takes place in the character of the males of very many species; instead  of being gregarious they either avoid one another and become hostile,  or, if their conditions of existence require that they shall still live  together, they become irritable and pugnacious. This change is made  known to us by the battles of varying degrees of severity which are such  a feature of bird life in the spring; and since a female can commonly be  observed to accompany the combatants, the possession of a mate appears  at first sight to be the proximate end for which the males are  contending. But when the circumstances which lead up to the quarrels are  investigated closely, the problem becomes more difficult; for it is not  merely a question of males fighting in the presence of a female, as is  generally supposed to be the case, but on the contrary there is a  complexity of strife which is bewildering--males attack females or _vice  versa_; female fights with female; or a pair combine to drive away  another pair, or even a solitary individual no matter of which sex. This  complexity of strife makes against the view that the possession of a  mate is the reason of the fighting. But an even stronger objection is to  be found in the fact that males are hostile when no female is  present--and hence we must seek elsewhere for the true explanation.    Now if the behaviour of a male be closely observed, it will be found  that its pugnacious instinct gains or loses susceptibility according to  the position which it happens to occupy--when its ground is trespassed  upon, the impulse to fight is strong; but when it crosses the boundary  it seems to lose all interest in the intruder. Moreover, in some  species, the male rejoins the flock at intervals during the early part  of the season and for a time leads a double existence, passing backwards  and forwards between its territory and the neutral ground. Its behaviour  under these circumstances affords some valuable evidence, for the bird  displays little if any hostility when accompanying the flock, yet when  it returns to the ground over which it exercises dominion, no male can  approach without being attacked. The conclusion, therefore, seems to be  inevitable, namely that the actual occupation of a territory is the  condition under which the pugnacious nature of the male is rendered  susceptible to appropriate stimulation.          CHAPTER IV    THE RELATION OF SONG TO THE TERRITORY      If we listen to the voices of the Waders as, in search of food, they  follow the slowly ebbing tide, we shall notice that each species has a  number of different cries, some of which are uttered frequently and  others only occasionally. Not only so, but if we study the circumstances  under which they are uttered, we shall in time learn to associate  certain specific notes with certain definite situations.    The Curlew, when surprised, utters a cry with which most of us, I  suppose, are familiar; but when with lowered head it drives away another  individual from the feeding ground, it gives expression to its feelings  by a low, raucous sound, which again is different from its cry when a  Common Gull steals the _arenicola_ that has been drawn out of the mud  with such labour.    Thus we come to speak of \"alarm notes,\" \"notes of anger,\" \"warning  notes\"--naming each according to the situations which normally accompany  their utterance. And so, all species, or at least a large majority of  them, have, in greater or lesser variety, cries and calls which are  peculiar to certain seasons and certain situations; and since on many  occasions we have indisputable evidence of the utility of the sound  produced--as when, upon the alarm being given by one individual, the  flock of Lapwing rises, or when, in response to a particular note of the  parent, the nestling Blackcap ceases to call--so are we bound to infer  that all the cries are, in one way or another, serviceable in furthering  the life of the individual.    But besides these call-notes, birds produce special sounds during the  season of reproduction--some by instrument, others by voice, others  again by the aid of mechanical device. And not only is this the case,  but many accompany their songs with peculiar flights, such as soaring to  a great height, or circling, or floating in the air upon outstretched  wings. These special sounds and special flights are those with which I  now propose to deal, including under the heading \"song\" all sounds  whether harsh or monotonous or beautiful, and whether vocally or  otherwise produced; and I shall endeavour to show not only that they are  related to the \"territory,\" but that they contribute not a little to the  successful attainment of reproduction.    The vocal productions are infinite in variety and combination. At the  one extreme we have songs composed of a single note repeated slowly or  rapidly as the case may be, whilst at the other we have the complex  productions of the Warblers; and between these two extremes, notes and  phrases are combined and recombined in ways innumerable. And just as  there is a rich variety of combination, so there is a very wide  variation in the purity and character of the notes--some are harsh,  others melodious, some flute-like, others more of a whistle, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32023"],[0,"The Boy's Voice (#19)"],[1,"COURT, CHAPEL ROYAL.--No boarding school.

In this list I have included songs with innocent, hopeful, joyous words  such as boys may honestly sing. Words dwelling with sadness on the past,  or speaking of life as bitter, I have excluded. Convivial and amatory  sentiments have also been ruled out. As to the music, I have excluded  songs with difficulties of vocalisation. The keys chosen are those best  suited to treble boys, bringing the melody as nearly as possible between  F and F{1}, with an occasional G{1}. The list is by no means  exhaustive, and must be regarded merely as a dip in the ocean of  ballads. I shall be much obliged to correspondents who will suggest  suitable additions.    Composer.
