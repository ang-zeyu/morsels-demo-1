[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46521"],[0,"Forty Years Among the Indians (#19)"],[1,"arrived from the states  bringing news of the army being ordered to Utah; and that the mail  contract which had been let to Brigham Young and company was cancelled,  and that in consequence of this the Y. X. (Young's Express) companies  were all called home. This was startling news, as all had been at peace  and nothing to justify the move could be surmised. The cause of this  whole raid and the result are matters of history, so I will not mention  the subject at present.    After getting my stuff together two of the brethren who had stayed  there during the winter accompanied me and we started back towards  South Pass, making the trip in good time. My partner, Mr. Roberts,  having traded to good advantage, we were soon ready to start home.    On arriving in Salt Lake City I went to the Tithing Office as I had  some articles belonging there. I was informed that Brother Brigham  wished to see me. I went at once to his office, not even taking time to  wash my face. As I got to the outside door of Brother Young's office  I met him coming out alone. After shaking hands, inquiring after my  health, etc., he said, \"Come, let us take a little walk. I want to  talk to you.\" We started and went toward his barn in the rear of his  dwelling. He informed me that there had been a formal complaint made  against me for robbing the people of their goods while at Devil's Gate;  said these complaints were made by some of the Elders in behalf of  themselves and others. He gave the names of some of my accusers. He  then asked, \"Are you willing to meet these accusations and answer them?\"    I replied, \"Yes, sir, I am both willing and glad of the opportunity.\"  At the same time I gave the names of some I wished as witnesses.    He then said, \"Be here in ten days from today and we will hear these  complaints.\"    I felt quite sore and would like to have had a little consolation from  Brother Brigham, but he commenced moving about, showing me his horses  and cattle and chatting till we returned to his office. His manner  was kind and pleasant. He asked me about my trip and success. Also  made some remarks about the army; saying that we would have a busy  time soon. Said the boys were going out to meet the army and see about  getting the road clear so that there would be no obstructions in the  way until they got near enough to us that we could see what was best  to do with them without having to go too far; that he had sent word to  have everything belonging to the mail company on the road, all goods  and everything \"Mormon\" started west as soon as possible.    It was harvest time when I got home to Provo. I felt almost sick. I had  never taken to the amount of a cent anything except such as we were  compelled to use, and these were always kept in account by the clerk.  As I had many opportunities to take goods and hide them and no one be  the wiser, and as goods had been misplaced, people were not entirely to  blame for accusing me after the stories had once got in circulation.  The originators of these accusations were the more responsible parties.  Many of the stories originated with the man who left his keys with me.  To please his family and other relatives he had collected for presents  considerable stuff while on his mission. Some of these things he had  given away to the brethren, as heretofore mentioned. I believe he left  his trunks and keys with me in perfect good faith at the time. After  getting home he naturally supposed we would use much of his stuff and  that this would justify him in accounting not only for what he had  given away but for all that his good-heartedness would have caused him  to do for his family. So there was nothing mentioned scarcely but what  he was fetching them, provided it was not taken from his trunks. When  his goods arrived and many of these fine things were missing, (one bill  of fifty pairs of silk stockings among the rest) of course \"Jones stole  them.\" I carried his keys all winter in my pocket, entrusting them to  no one, so of course I knew whether anything was stolen or not.    It was this same man's wife that came to search for stolen goods during  the winter. There was so much rascality brought to light that winter  that it was no wonder that nearly everyone except my wife and family  thought I was guilty.    The emigrants, taking their cue from this brother, passed my name far  and wide as a great robber. So much so that I was refused admittance  into a quorum of Seventies at Provo that I had formerly been invited to  join.    I returned home and worked a few days in the harvest field. I said  but little to anyone about my coming trial. I was tempted at times to  leave the country, for it seemed to me that I had no friends. The devil  tempted me continually to believe that President Young would believe my  accusers, they being men of influence. Then there was another spirit  whispering to me, saying, \"You are innocent; he is a prophet and will  understand the truth.\" This spirit prevailed.    On arriving at President Young's office August 25th, 1857, I found  quite a number present. I was asked if I was ready for the hearing.  I replied that I did not see my witnesses. President Young answered:  \"When we need them we will send for them.\" I was then called upon to  give my report and show how we had lived, what the cost of living was,  etc. I had an account of all our expenditures, which amounted to about  75 cts. a week for each man. Some one remarked that we could not live  so cheaply. Then began quite a discussion over our cheap living. Some  were inclined to question my statement. Brother Young said to me,  \"Brother Jones, get up and tell the brethren just how you lived, and  explain to them why your accounts only amount to 75 cts. a week.\"    I then made the statement that we had killed and eaten forty head of  cattle that were so poor they were dying; we had lived on the meat and  hides some two months; that we had not credited the owners anything for  them, as we thought it was worth the cattle to eat them. That we had  killed some game at various times. That was ours, no credit allowed;  had lived two weeks on thistles dug from the frozen ground, no credit;  one week on native garlic; three days on minnows caught with a dip-net,  fish too small to clean, rather bitter in taste, no credit; several  meals on prickly pear leaves roasted, no credit; several days without  anything much but water to drink, no credit; some five months mostly on  short rations without bread or salt. These were about all the reasons  for the price being so low. The seventy-five cents per week covered  all the meats bought of Indians or anyone else. All groceries, soap,  candles, in fact everything used belonging to the companies, including  some leather owned by F. D. Richards, who remarked to me that he was  glad it was there for us to use. Brothers Jas. Ferguson and W. C.  Dunbar also made the same remark about some groceries used of theirs.  Not so with some others. They grieved very much over what stuff had  been used of theirs.    After I got through making my statements. Brother Young asked each of  my accusers what they had to say. No one answered. Then he spoke each  man's name, asking them one at a time if they believed what I had said.  All replied in the affirmative. He asked each one if they believed I  had been honest, and taken good care of their goods. All answered \"Yes.\"    Brother Young then stood up and said to the brethren, \"You have accused  Bro. Jones of stealing from you and others whom you represent, some  five thousand dollars worth of goods. These accusations commenced in  the winter when Brother Jones and companions were eating raw hide and  poor meat, suffering every privation possible to take care of your  stuff. How such stories started when there was no communication can  only be accounted for by the known power of Satan to deceive and lie.  These accusations continued until I, hearing of them, wrote a letter  to the Bishops and Presidents, expressing my confidence in Brother  Jones' labors; knowing at that time, as well as I do now, that he was  innocent. I knew what Brother Jones' feelings were the other day when  I notified him of this trial.\" Turning to me he said, \"You wanted to  ask me if I thought you guilty, but I gave you no chance to ask the  question. I wanted you to learn that when I decide anything, as I  had in your case, I do not change my mind. You were not brought here  for trial for being guilty, but to give you a chance to stop these  accusations.\" Then turning to my accusers again, \"How does this look?  After charging Brother Jones as you have, he makes a simple statement,  affirming nothing, neither witnessing anything, and each of you say you  believe he has told the truth. You have nothing to answer save that he  is an honest man. Well, now, what have you brought him here for?\"    One of the complainers then asked if some of the company with me might  not have stolen the goods. I answered \"No; I am here to answer for all.  Besides it would have been almost impossible for anyone besides myself  to have taken anything unbeknown to others.\"    Bro. ----- asked, \"If neither Bro. Jones nor the brethren with him have  taken anything, how is it that I have lost so much?\"    Brother Brigham replied, \"It is because you lie. You have not lost as  you say you have.\" This I knew to be correct as before stated, I had  this brother's keys and knew that nothing had been taken.    Brother Brigham continued talking, chastising some of the Elders  present for their ingratitude. Brother Kimball also felt indignant  toward them. Finally Brother Brigham commenced to pronounce a curse  upon those who had spoken falsely about me. I asked him to stop before  he had finished the words, and told him I could bear their accusations  better than they could bear his curse. He then blessed me, saying they  would be cursed if they did not cease their talk; saying that we had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"\"scrannel  pipe\" of abominable discordance, in honour of a perverse saint whose  corpse insisted upon being buried inside some respectable man's  dwelling-house.[FN#13] The scene reminds you strongly of the Sonneurs  of Brittany and the Zampognari from the Abruzzian Highlands bagpiping  before the Madonna. There a tall, gaunt Maghrabi displays upon a square  yard of    [p.81]dirty paper certain lines and blots, supposed to represent the  venerable Ka'abah, and collects coppers to defray the expenses of his  pilgrimage. A steady stream of loungers sets through the principal  thoroughfares towards the Azbakiyah Gardens, which skirt the Frank  quarter; there they sit in the moonlight, listening to Greek and  Turkish bands, or making merry with cakes, toasted grains, coffee,  sugared-drinks, and the broad pleasantries of Kara Gyuz[FN#14] (the  local Punch and Judy). Here the scene is less thoroughly Oriental than  within the city; but the appearance of Frank dress amongst the  varieties of Eastern costume, the moon-lit sky, and the light mist  hanging over the deep shade of the Acacia trees-whose rich scented  yellow-white blossoms are popularly compared to the old Pasha's  beard[FN#15]-make it passing picturesque. And the traveller from the  far East remarks with wonder the presence of certain ladies, whose only  mark of modesty is the Burka, or face-veil: upon this laxity the police  looks with lenient eyes, inasmuch as, until very lately, it paid a  respectable tax to the state.[FN#16]    Returning to the Moslem quarter, you are bewildered    [p.82]by its variety of sounds. Everyone talks, and talking here is  always in extremes, either in a whisper, or in a scream; gesticulation  excites the lungs, and strangers cannot persuade themselves that men so  converse without being or becoming furious. All the street cries, too,  are in the soprano key. \"In thy protection! in thy protection!\" shouts  a Fellah peasant to a sentinel, who is flogging him towards the  station-house, followed by a tail of women, screaming, \"Ya Gharati-ya  Dahwati-ya Hasrati-ya Nidamati-O my calamity! O my shame!\" The boys  have elected a Pasha, whom they are conducting in procession, with  wisps of straw for Mash'als, or cressets, and outrunners, all huzzaing  with ten-schoolboy power. \"O thy right! O thy left! O thy face! O thy  heel! O thy back, thy back!\" cries the panting footman, who, huge torch  on shoulder, runs before the grandee's carriage; \"Bless the Prophet and  get out of the way!\" \"O Allah bless him!\" respond the good Moslems,  some shrinking up to the walls to avoid the stick, others rushing  across the road, so as to give themselves every chance of being knocked  down. The donkey boy beats his ass with a heavy palm-cudgel,-he fears  no treadmill here,-cursing him at the top of his voice for a \"pander,\"  a \"Jew,\" a \"Christian,\" and a \"son of the One-eyed, whose portion is  Eternal Punishment.\" \"O chick pease! O pips!\" sings the vendor of  parched grains, rattling the unsavoury load in his basket. \"Out of the  way, and say, There is one God,'\" pants the industrious water-carrier,  laden with a skin, fit burden for a buffalo. \"Sweet-water, and gladden  thy soul, O lemonade!\" pipes the seller of that luxury, clanging his  brass cups together. Then come the beggars, intensely Oriental. \"My  supper is in Allah's hands, my supper is in Allah's hands! whatever  thou givest, that will go with thee!\" chaunts the old vagrant, whose  wallet perhaps contains more provision than the basket of many a  respectable shopkeeper.  [p.83]\"Na'al abuk[FN#17]-rucse thy father-O brother of a naughty  sister!\" is the response of some petulant Greek to the touch of the old  man's staff. \"The grave is darkness, and good deeds are its lamp!\" sing  the blind women, rapping two sticks together: \"upon Allah! upon Allah!  O daughter!\" cry the bystanders, when the obstinate \"bint\"[FN#18]  (daughter) of sixty years seizes their hands, and will not let go  without extorting a farthing. \"Bring the sweet\" (i.e. fire), \"and take  the full,\"[FN#19] (i.e., empty cup), euphuistically cry the  long-moustached, fierce-browed Arnauts to the coffee-house keeper, who  stands by them charmed by the rhyming repartee that flows so readily  from their lips.    \"Hanien,\" may it be pleasant to thee![FN#20] is the signal for  encounter.    [p.84]\"Thou drinkest for ten,\" replies the other, instead of returning  the usual religious salutation.    \"I am the cock and thou art the hen!\" is the rejoinder,-a tart one.  \"Nay, I am the thick one and thou art the thin!\" resumes the first  speaker, and so on till they come to equivoques which will not bear a  literal English translation.    And sometimes, high above the hubbub, rises the melodious voice of the  blind mu'ezzin, who, from his balcony in the beetling tower rings  forth, \"Hie ye to devotion! Hie ye to salvation.\" And (at  morning-prayer time) he adds: \"Devotion is better than sleep! Devotion  is better than sleep!\" Then good Moslems piously stand up, and mutter,  previous to prayer, \"Here am I at Thy call, O Allah! here am I at Thy  call!\"    Sometimes I walked with my friend to the citadel, and sat upon a high  wall, one of the outworks of Mohammed Ali's Mosque, enjoying a view  which, seen by night, when the summer moon is near the full, has a  charm no power of language can embody. Or escaping from \"stifled  Cairo's filth,[FN#21]\" we passed, through the Gate of Victory, into the  wilderness beyond the City of the Dead.[FN#22] Seated upon some mound  of ruins, we inhaled    [p.85]the fine air of the Desert, inspiriting as a cordial, when  star-light and dew-mists diversified a scene, which, by day, is one  broad sea of yellow loam with billows of chalk rock, thinly covered by  a film-like spray of sand surging and floating in the fiery wind.  There, within a mile of crowded life, all is desolate; the town walls  seem crumbling to decay, the hovels are tenantless, and the paths  untrodden; behind you lies the Wild, before you, the thousand  tomb-stones, ghastly in their whiteness; while beyond them the tall  dark forms of the Mamluk Soldans' towers rise from the low and hollow  ground like the spirits of kings guarding ghostly subjects in the  Shadowy Realm. Nor less weird than the scene are the sounds!-the  hyaena's laugh, the howl of the wild dog, and the screech of the  low-flying owl. Or we spent the evening at some Takiyah[FN#23]  (Darwayshes' Oratory), generally preferring that called the \"Gulshani,\"  near the Muayyid Mosque outside the Mutawalli's saintly door. There is  nothing attractive in its appearance. You mount a flight of ragged  steps, and enter a low verandah enclosing an open stuccoed terrace,  where stands the holy man's domed tomb: the two stories contain small  dark rooms in which the Darwayshes dwell, and the ground-floor doors  open into the    [p.86]verandah. During the fast-month, Zikrs[FN#24] are rarely  performed in the Takiyahs: the inmates pray there in congregations, or  they sit conversing upon benches in the shade. And a curious medley of  men they are, composed of the choicest vagabonds from every nation of  Al-Islam. Beyond this I must not describe the Takiyah or the doings  there, for the \"path\" of the Darwaysh may not be trodden by feet  profane.    Curious to see something of my old friends the Persians, I called with  Haji Wali upon one Mirza Husayn, who by virtue of his dignity as  \"Shahbandar[FN#25]\" (he calls himself \"Consul-General\"), ranks with the  dozen little quasi-diplomatic kings of Cairo. He suspends over his  lofty gate a sign-board in which the Lion and the Sun (Iran's proud  ensign) are by some Egyptian limner's art metamorphosed into a  preternatural tabby cat grasping a scimitar, with the jolly fat face of  a \"gay\" young lady, curls and all complete, resting fondly upon her  pet's concave back. This high dignitary's reception room was a  court-yard sub dio: fronting the door were benches and cushions  composing the Sadr or high place, with the parallel rows of Diwans  spread down the less dignified sides, and a line of naked boards, the  lowest seats, ranged along the door-wall. In the middle stood three  little tables supporting three huge lanterns-as is their size so is the  owner's dignity-each of which contained three of the largest spermaceti  candles.    The Haji and I entering took our seats upon the side benches with  humility, and exchanged salutations with the great man on the Sadr.  When the Darbar or levee was full, in stalked the Mirza, and all arose  as he calmly divested himself of his shoes; and with all due    [p.87]solemnity ascended his proper cushion. He is a short, thin man  about thirty-five, with regular features and the usual preposterous  lamb-skin cap and beard, two peaked black cones at least four feet in  length, measured from the tips, resting on a slender basement of pale  yellow face. After a quarter of an hour of ceremonies, polite  mutterings and low bendings with the right hand on the left breast, the  Mirza's pipe was handed to him first, in token of his dignity-at  Teheran he was probably an under-clerk in some government office. In  due time we were all served with Kaliuns[FN#26] (Persian hookahs) and  coffee by the servants, who made royal conges whenever they passed the  great man; and more than once the janissary, in dignity of belt and  crooked sabre, entered the court to quicken our awe.    The conversation was the usual Oriental thing. It is, for instance,  understood that you have seen strange things in strange lands.    \"Voyaging-is-victory,\" quotes the Mirza; the quotation is a hackneyed  one, but it steps forth majestic as to pause and emphasis.    \"Verily,\" you reply with equal ponderousness of pronunciation and  novelty of citation, \"in leaving home one learns life, yet a journey is  a bit of Jahannam.\"    Or if you are a physician the \"lieu commun\" will be,  \"Little-learn'd doctors the body destroy:  Little-learn'd"]]]
