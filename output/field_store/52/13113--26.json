The  third time the wall was built it stood.'    _Fairies passing through Stone Walls._--'Where MacEwen's house stands  was a noted fairy place. Men in building the house saw fairies on horses  coming across the spot, and the stone walls did not stop them at all.'    _Seeing the 'Gentry'._--'A cousin of mine, who was a pilot, once went to  the watch-house up there on the Point to take his brother's place; and  he saw ladies coming towards him as he crossed the Greenlands. At first  he thought they were coming from a dance, but there was no dance going  then, and, if there had been, no human beings dressed like them and  moving as they were could have come from any part of the globe, and in  so great a party, at that hour of the night. Then when they passed him  and he saw how beautiful they were, he knew them for the _gentry_  women.'    'Michael Reddy (our next witness) saw the _gentry_ down on the  Greenlands in regimentals like an army, and in daylight. He was a young  man at the time, and had been sent out to see if any cattle were  astray.'    And this is what Michael Reddy, of Rosses Point, now a sailor on the  ship _Tartar_, sailing from Sligo to neighbouring ports on the Irish  coast, asserts in confirmation of Owen Conway's statement about him:--'I  saw the _gentry_ on the strand (at Lower Rosses Point) about forty years  ago. It was afternoon. I first saw one of them like an officer pointing  at me what seemed a sword; and when I got on the Greenlands I saw a  great company of _gentry_, like soldiers, in red, laughing and shouting.  Their leader was a big man, and they were ordinary human size. As a  result [of this vision] I took to my bed and lay there for weeks. Upon  another occasion, late at night, I was with my mother milking cows, and  we heard the _gentry_ all round us talking, but could not see them.'    _Going to the 'Gentry' through Death, Dreams, or Trance._--John  O'Conway, one of the most reliable citizens of Upper Rosses Point,  offers the following testimony concerning the 'gentry':--'In olden times  the _gentry_ were very numerous about _forts_ and here on the  Greenlands, but rarely seen. They appeared to be the same as any living  men. When people died it was said the _gentry_ took them, for they would  afterwards appear among the _gentry_.'    'We had a ploughman of good habits who came in one day too late for his  morning's work, and he in excuse very seriously said, \"May be if you had  travelled all night as much as I have you wouldn't talk. I was away with  the _gentry_, and save for a lady I couldn't have been back now. I saw a  long hall full of many people. Some of them I knew and some I did not  know. The lady saved me by telling me to eat no food there, however  enticing it might be.\"'    'A young man at Drumcliffe was _taken_ [in a trance state], and was with  the _Daoine Maithe_ some time, and then got back. Another man, whom I  knew well, was haunted by the _gentry_ for a long time, and he often  went off with _them_' (apparently in a dream or trance state).    _'Sidhe' Music._--The story which now follows substantiates the  testimony of cultured Irish seers that at Lower Rosses Point the music  of the _Sidhe_ can be heard:--'Three women were gathering shell-fish, in  the month of March, on the lowest point of the strand (Lower Rosses or  Wren Point) when they heard the most beautiful music. They set to work  to dance with it, and danced themselves sick. They then thanked the  invisible musician and went home.'      THE TESTIMONY OF A COLLEGE PROFESSOR    Our next witness is the Rev. Father ----, a professor in a Catholic  college in West Ireland, and most of his statements are based on events  which happened among his own acquaintances and relatives, and his  deductions are the result of careful investigation:--    _Apparitions from Fairyland._--'Some twenty to thirty years ago, on the  borders of County Roscommon near County Sligo, according to the firm  belief of one of my own relatives, a sister of his was _taken_ by the  fairies on her wedding-night, and she appeared to her mother afterwards  as an apparition. She seemed to want to speak, but her mother, who was  in bed at the time, was thoroughly frightened, and turned her face to  the wall. The mother is convinced that she saw this apparition of her  daughter, and my relative thinks she might have saved her.    'This same relative who gives it as his opinion that his sister was  _taken_ by the fairies, at a different time saw the apparition of  another relative of mine who also, according to similar belief, had been  _taken_ by the fairies when only five years old. The child-apparition  appeared beside its living sister one day while the sister was going  from the yard into the house, and it followed her in. It is said the  child was _taken_ because she was such a good girl.'    _Nature of the Belief in Fairies._--'As children we were always afraid  of fairies, and were taught to say \"God bless _them_! God bless _them_!\"  whenever we heard them mentioned.    'In our family we always made it a point to have clean water in the  house at night for the fairies.    'If anything like dirty water was thrown out of doors after dark it was  necessary to say \"_Hugga, hugga salach!_\" as a warning to the fairies  not to get their clothes wet.    'Untasted food, like milk, used to be left on the table at night for the  fairies. If you were eating and food fell from you, it was not right to  take it back, for the fairies wanted it. Many families are very serious  about this even now. The luckiest thing to do in such cases is to pick  up the food and eat just a speck of it and then throw the rest away to  the fairies.    'Ghosts and apparitions are commonly said to live in isolated  thorn-bushes, or thorn-trees. Many lonely bushes of this kind have their  ghosts. For example, there is Fanny's Bush, Sally's Bush, and another I  know of in County Sligo near Boyle.'    _Personal Opinions._--'The fairies of any one race are the people of the  preceding race--the Fomors for the Fir Bolgs, the Fir Bolgs for the  Dananns, and the Dananns for us. The old races died. Where did they go?  They became spirits--and fairies. Second-sight gave our race power to  see the inner world. When Christianity came to Ireland the people had no  _definite_ heaven. Before, their ideas about the other world were vague.  But the older ideas of a spirit world remained side by side with the  Christian ones, and being preserved in a subconscious way gave rise to  the fairy world.'      EVIDENCE FROM COUNTY ROSCOMMON    Our next place for investigation will be the ancient province of the  great fairy-queen Meave, who made herself famous by leading against  Cuchulainn the united armies of four of the five provinces of Ireland,  and all on account of a bull which she coveted. And there could be no  better part of it to visit than Roscommon, which Dr. Douglas Hyde has  made popular in Irish folk-lore.    _Dr. Hyde and the Leprechaun._--One day while I was privileged to be at  Ratra, Dr. Hyde invited me to walk with him in the country. After we had  visited an old _fort_ which belongs to the 'good people', and had  noticed some other of their haunts in that part of Queen Meave's realm,  we entered a straw-thatched cottage on the roadside and found the good  house-wife and her fine-looking daughter both at home. In response to  Dr. Hyde's inquiries, the mother stated that one day, in her girlhood,  near a hedge from which she was gathering wild berries, she saw a  leprechaun in a hole under a stone:--'He wasn't much larger than a doll,  and he was most perfectly formed, with a little mouth and eyes.' Nothing  was told about the little fellow having a money-bag, although the woman  said people told her afterwards that she would have been rich if she had  only had sense enough to catch him when she had so good a chance.[22]    _The Death Coach._--The next tale the mother told was about the death  coach which used to pass by the very house we were in. Every night until  after her daughter was born she used to rise up on her elbow in bed to  listen to the death coach passing by. It passed about midnight, and she  could hear the rushing, the tramping of the horses, and most beautiful  singing, just like fairy music, but she could not understand the words.  Once or twice she was brave enough to open the door and look out as the  coach passed, but she could never see a thing, though there was the  noise and singing. One time a man had to wait on the roadside to let the  fairy horses go by, and he could hear their passing very clearly, and  couldn't see one of them.    When we got home, Dr. Hyde told me that the fairies of the region are  rarely seen. The people usually say that they hear or feel them only.    _The 'Good People' and Mr. Gilleran._--After the mother had testified,  the daughter, who is quite of the younger generation, gave her own  opinion. She said that the 'good people' live in the _forts_ and often  take men and women or youths who pass by the _forts_ after sunset; that  Mr. Gilleran, who died not long ago, once saw certain dead friends and  recognized among them those who were believed to have been _taken_ and  those who died naturally, and that he saw them again when he was on his  death-bed.    We have here, as in so many other accounts, a clear connexion between  the realm of the dead and Fairyland.      THE TESTIMONY OF A LOUGH DERG SEER    Neil Colton, seventy-three years old, who lives in Tamlach Townland, on  the shores of Lough Derg, County Donegal, has a local reputation for  having seen the 'gentle folk', and so I called upon him. As we sat round  his blazing turf fire, and in the midst of his family of three sturdy  boys--for he married late in life--this is what he related:--    _A Girl Recovered from Faerie._--'One day, just before sunset in  midsummer, and I a boy then, my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#19)"],[1,"statement--that the Government intended, at some  indefinite time, to bring in a general reform bill which _might_ be  amended to include woman suffrage. Our wonderful demonstration, it  appeared, had made no impression whatever upon him.          CHAPTER III      Now we had reached a point where we had to choose between two  alternatives. We had exhausted argument. Therefore either we had to give  up our agitation altogether, as the suffragists of the eighties  virtually had done, or else we must act, and go on acting, until the  selfishness and the obstinacy of the Government was broken down, or the  Government themselves destroyed. Until forced to do so, the Government,  we perceived, would never give women the vote.    We realised the truth of John Bright's words, spoken while the reform  bill of 1867 was being agitated. Parliament, John Bright then declared,  had never been hearty for any reform. The Reform Act of 1832 had been  wrested by force from the Government of that day, and now before  another, he said, could be carried, the agitators would have to fill the  streets with people from Charing Cross to Westminster Abbey. Acting on  John Bright's advice, we issued a call to the public to join us in  holding a huge demonstration, on June 30th outside the House of Commons.  We wanted to be sure that the Government saw as well as read of our  immense following. A public proclamation from the Commissioner of  Police, warning the public not to assemble in Parliament Square and  declaring that the approaches to the Houses of Parliament must be kept  open, was at once issued.    We persisted in announcing that the demonstration would take place, and  I wrote a letter to Mr. Asquith telling him that a deputation would wait  upon him at half-past four on the afternoon of June 30th. We held the  usual Women's Parliament in Caxton Hall, after which Mrs. Pethick  Lawrence, eleven other women, and myself, set forth. We met with no  opposition from the police, but marched through cheering crowds of  spectators to the Strangers' Entrance to the House of Commons. Here we  were met by a large group of uniformed men commanded by Inspector  Scantlebury, of the police. The inspector, whom I knew personally,  stepped forward and demanded officially, \"Are you Mrs. Pankhurst, and is  this your deputation?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied.    \"My orders are to exclude you from the House of Commons.\"    \"Has Mr. Asquith received my letter?\" I asked.    For answer the inspector drew my letter from his pocket and handed it to  me.    \"Did Mr. Asquith return no message, no kind of reply?\" I inquired.    \"No,\" replied the inspector.    We turned and walked back to Caxton Hall, to tell the waiting audience  what had occurred. We resolved that there was nothing to do but wait  patiently until evening, and see how well the public would respond to  our call to meet in Parliament Square. Already we knew that the streets  were filled with people, and early as it was the crowds were increasing  rapidly. At eight we went out in groups from Caxton Hall, to find  Parliament Square packed with a throng, estimated next day at least  100,000. From the steps of public buildings, from stone copings, from  the iron railings of the Palace Yard, to which they clung precariously,  our women made speeches until the police pulled them down and flung them  into the moving, swaying, excited crowds. Some of the women were  arrested, others were merely ordered to move on. Mingled cheers and  jeers rose from the spectators. Some of the men were roughs who had come  out to amuse themselves. Others were genuinely sympathetic, and tried  valiantly to help us to reach the House of Commons. Again and again the  police lines were broken, and it was only as the result of repeated  charges by mounted police that the people's attacks were repelled. Many  members of Parliament, including Mr. Lloyd-George, Mr. Winston  Churchill, and Mr. Herbert Gladstone, came out to witness the struggle,  which lasted until midnight and resulted in the arrest of twenty-nine  women. Two of these women were arrested after they had each thrown a  stone through a window of Mr. Asquith's official residence in Downing  Street, the value of the windows being about $2.40.    This was the first window-breaking in our history. Mrs. Mary Leigh and  Miss Edith New, who had thrown the stones, sent word to me from the  police court that, having acted without orders, they would not resent  repudiation from headquarters. Far from repudiating them, I went at once  to see them in their cells, and assured them of my approval of their  act. The smashing of windows is a time-honoured method of showing  displeasure in a political situation. As one of the newspapers,  commenting on the affair, truly said, \"When the King and Queen dine at  Apsley on the 13th inst. they will be entertained in rooms the windows  of which the Duke of Wellington was obliged to protect with iron  shutters from the fury of his political opponents.\"    In Winchester a few years ago, to give but one instance, a great riot  took place as a protest against the removal of a historic gun from one  part of the town to another. In the course of this riot windows were  broken and other property of various kinds was destroyed, very serious  damage being done. No punishment was administered in respect of this  riot and the authorities, bowing to public opinion thus riotously  expressed, restored the gun to its original situation.    Window-breaking, when Englishmen do it, is regarded as honest expression  of political opinion. Window-breaking, when Englishwomen do it, is  treated as a crime. In sentencing Mrs. Leigh and Miss New to two months  in the first division, the magistrate used very severe language, and  declared that such a thing must never happen again. Of course the women  assured him that it would happen again. Said Mrs. Leigh: \"We have no  other course but to rebel against oppression, and if necessary to resort  to stronger measures. This fight is going on.\"    The summer of 1908 is remembered as one of the most oppressively hot  seasons the country had known for years. Our prisoners in Holloway  suffered intensely, some being made desperately ill from the heat, the  bad air, and the miserable food. We who spent the summer campaigning  suffered also, but in less degree. It was a tremendous relief when the  cool days of autumn set in, and it was with renewed vigour that we  prepared for the opening day of Parliament, which was October 12th.  Again we resolved to send a deputation to the Prime Minister, and again  we invited the general public to take part in the demonstration. We had  printed thousands of little handbills bearing this inscription: \"Men and  Women, Help the Suffragettes to Rush the House of Commons, on Tuesday  Evening, October 13th, at 7:30.\"    On Sunday, October 11th, we held a large meeting in Trafalgar Square, my  daughter Christabel, Mrs. Drummond and I speaking from the plinth of the  Nelson monument. Mr. Lloyd-George, as we afterward learned, was a member  of the audience. The police were there, taking ample notes of our  speeches. We had not failed to notice that they were watching us daily,  dogging our footsteps, and showing in numerous ways that they were under  orders to keep track of all our movements. The climax came at noon on  October 12th, when Christabel, Mrs. Drummond and I were each served with  an imposing legal document which read, \"Information has been laid this  day by the Commissioner of Police that you, in the month of October, in  the year 1908, were guilty of conduct likely to provoke a breach of the  peace by initiating and causing to be initiated, by publishing and  causing to be published, a certain handbill, calling upon and inciting  the public to do a certain wrongful and illegal act, viz., to rush the  House of Commons at 7:30 P.M. on October 13th inst.\"    [Illustration: MRS. PANKHURST AND CHRISTABEL HIDING FROM THE POLICE ON  THE ROOF GARDEN AT CLEMENTS INN    _October, 1908_]    The last paragraph was a summons to appear at Bow Street police station  that same afternoon at three o'clock. We did not go to Bow Street police  station. We went instead to a crowded \"At Home\" at Queen's Hall, where  it can be imagined that our news created great excitement. The place was  surrounded by constables, and the police reporters were on hand to take  stenographic reports of everything that was said from the platform. Once  an excited cry was raised that a police inspector was coming in to  arrest us. But the officer merely brought a message that the summons had  been adjourned until the following morning.    It did not suit our convenience to obey the adjourned summons quite so  early, so I wrote a polite note to the police, saying that we would be  in our headquarters, No. 4 Clements Inn, the next evening at six  o'clock, and would then be at his disposal. Warrants for our arrests  were quickly issued, and Inspector Jarvis was instructed to execute them  at once. This he found impossible to do, for Mrs. Drummond was spending  her last day of liberty on private business, while my daughter and I had  retreated to another part of Clements Inn, which is a big, rambling  building. There, in the roof-garden of the Pethick Lawrence's private  flat, we remained all day, busy, under the soft blue of the autumn sky,  with our work and our preparations for a long absence. At six we walked  downstairs, dressed for the street. Mrs. Drummond arrived promptly, the  waiting officers read the warrants, and we all proceeded to Bow Street  in cabs. It was too late for the trial to be held. We asked for bail,  but the authorities had no mind to allow us to take part in the \"rush\"  which we had incited, so we were obliged to spend the night in the  police station. All night I lay awake, thinking of the scenes which were  going on in the streets.    The next morning, in a courtroom crowded to its utmost"]]]
