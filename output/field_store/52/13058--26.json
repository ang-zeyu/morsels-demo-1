Moreover they were near enough to the haunts of the buffalo to depend on  that great beast for food. Since one buffalo supplies as much food as a  hundred rabbits, these Indians were vastly better off than the people of  the drier parts of the western coast.    South of the home of the Kutenai, in eastern Oregon, southern Idaho,  Nevada, Utah, and neighboring regions dwelt the Utes and other Shoshoni  tribes. In this region the rainfall, which is no greater than that of  California, occurs chiefly in winter. The long summer is so dry that,  except by highly developed methods of irrigation, agriculture is  impossible. Hence it is not surprising to find a traveler in 1850  describing one tribe of the Ute family as \"without exception the most  miserable looking set of human beings I ever saw. They have hitherto  subsisted principally on snakes, lizards, roots.\" The lowest of all the  Ute tribes were those who lived in the sage-brush. The early explorer,  Bonneville, found the tribes of Snake River wintering in brush shelters  without roofs merely heaps of brush piled high, behind which the Indians  crouched for protection from wind and snow. Crude as such shelters may  seem, they were the best that could be constructed by people who dwelt  where there was no vegetation except little bushes, and where the soil  was for the most part sandy or so salty that it could not easily be made  into adobe bricks.    The food of these Utes and Shoshonis was no better than their shelters.  There were no large animals for them to hunt; rabbits were the best that  they could find. Farther to the east, where the buffalo wandered during  part of the year and where there are some forests, the food was better,  the shelters were more effective, and, in general, the standard of  living was higher, although racially the two groups of people were  alike. In this case, as in others, the people whose condition was lowest  were apparently as competent as those whose material conditions were  much better. Today, although the Ute Indians, like most of their race,  are rather slow, some tribes, such as the Payutes, are described as  not only \"peaceful and moral,\" but also \"industrious.\" They are highly  commended for their good qualities by those who have had the best  opportunities for judging. While not as bright in intellect as some of  the prairie tribes whom we shall soon consider, they appear to possess  more solidity of character. By their willingness and efficiency as  workers they have made themselves necessary to the white farmers  and have thus supplied themselves with good clothing and many of the  comforts of life. They have resisted, too, many of the evils coming from  the advance of civilization, so that one agent speaks of these Indians  as presenting the singular anomaly of improving by contact with the  whites. Apparently their extremely low condition in former times was due  merely to that same handicap of environment which kept back the Indians  of California.    Compare these backward but not wholly ungifted Utes with the Hopi who  belonged to the same stock. The relatively high social organization of  the latter people and the intricacy and significance of their religious  ceremonials are well known. Mentally the Hopi seem to be the equal  of any tribe, but it is doubtful whether they have much more innate  capacity than many of their more backward neighbors. Nevertheless they  made much more progress before the days of the white man, as can easily  be seen in their artistic development. Every one who has crossed the  continent by the Santa Fe route knows how interesting and beautiful  are their pottery, basketry, and weaving. Not only in art but also  in government the Hopi are highly advanced. Their governing body is  a council of hereditary elders together with the chiefs of religious  fraternities. Among these officials there is a speaker chief and a war  chief, but there seems never to have been any supreme chief of all the  Hopi. Each pueblo has an hereditary chief who directs all the communal  work, such as the cleaning of the springs and the general care of the  village. Crimes are rare. This at first sight seems strange in view of  the fact that no penalty was inflicted for any crime except sorcery, but  under Hopi law all transgressions could be reduced to sorcery. One  of the most striking features of Hopi life was its rich religious  development. The Hopi recognized a large number of supernatural beings  and had a great store of most interesting and poetic mythological  tales. The home of the Hopi would seem at first sight as unfavorable to  progress as that of their Ute cousins, but the Hopi have the advantage  of being the most northwesterly representatives of the Indians who dwell  within the regions of summer rain. Fortunately for them, their country  is too desert and unforested for them to subsist to any great degree  by the chase. They are thus forced to devote all their energy to  agriculture, through which they have developed a relatively high  standard of living. They dwell far enough south to have their heaviest  rainfall in summer and not in winter, as is the case in Utah, so that  they are able to cultivate crops of corn and beans. Where such an  intensive system of agriculture prevails, the work of women is as  valuable as that of men. The position of woman is thus relatively high  among the Hopi, for she is useful not only for her assistance in the  labors of the field but also for her skill in preserving the crops,  grinding the flour, and otherwise preparing the comparatively varied  food which this tribe fortunately possesses.    From northern New Mexico and Arizona to Mexico City summer rains, dry  winters, and still drier springs, are the rule. Forests are few, and  much of the country is desert. The more abundant the rains, the  greater the number of people and the greater the opportunities for the  accumulation of wealth, and thus for that leisure which is necessary  to part of a community if civilization is to make progress. That is  one reason why the civilization of the summer rain people becomes more  highly developed as they go from north to south. The fact that the  altitude of the country increases from the United States border  southward also tends in the same direction, for it causes the climate to  be cooler and more bracing at Mexico City than at places farther north.    The importance of summer rains in stimulating growth and in facilitating  the early stages of agriculture is noteworthy. Every one familiar with  Arizona and New Mexico knows how the sudden summer showers fill the  mountain valleys with floods which flow down upon the plain and rapidly  spread out into broad, thin sheets, often known as playas. There the  water stands a short time and then either sinks into the ground or  evaporates. Such places are favored with the best kind of natural  irrigation, and after the first shower it is an easy matter for the  primitive farmer to go out and drop grains of corn into holes punched  with a stick. Thereafter he can count on other showers to water his  field while the corn sprouts and grows to maturity. All that he needs  to do is to watch the field to protect it from the rare depredations  of wild animals. As time goes on the primitive farmer realizes the  advantage of leading the water to particularly favorable spots and thus  begins to develop a system of artificial irrigation. In regions where  such advantageous conditions prevail, the people who live permanently  in one place succeed best, for the work that they do one year helps them  the next. They are not greatly troubled by weeds, for, though grasses  grow as well as corn in the places where the water spreads out, the  grasses take the form of little clumps which can easily be pulled up.  In the drier parts of the area of summer rain, it becomes necessary to  conserve the water supply to the utmost. The Hopi consider sandy fields  the best, for the loose sand on top acts as a natural blanket to prevent  evaporation from the underlying layers. Sometimes in dry seasons the  Hopi use extraordinary methods to help their seeds to sprout. For  instance, they place a seed in a ball of saturated mud which they  bury beneath several inches of sand. As the sand prevents evaporation,  practically all the water is retained for the use of the seed, which  thereupon sprouts and grows some inches by the time the first summer  floods arrive.    The Indians of the Great Plains lived a very different life from that  of the natives of either the mountains or the Pacific coast. In the far  north, to be sure, the rigorous climate caused all the Indians to live  practically alike, whether in the Rockies, the plains, or the Laurentian  highland. South of them, in that great central expanse stretching from  the latitude of Lake Winnipeg to the Rio Grande River, the Indians  of the plains possessed a relatively uniform type of life peculiar to  themselves. This individuality was due partly to the luxuriant carpet of  grass which covered the plains and partly to the supply of animal  food afforded by the vast herds of buffaloes which roamed in tens  of thousands throughout the whole territory. The grass was important  chiefly because it prevented the Indians from engaging in agriculture,  for it must never be forgotten that the Indians had neither iron tools  nor beasts of burden to aid them in overcoming the natural difficulties  in the way of agriculture. To be sure, they did occasionally pound  meteoric iron into useful implements, but this substance was so rare  that probably not one Indian in a hundred had ever seen a piece. The  Indians were quite familiar with copper, but there is not the slightest  evidence that they had discovered any means of hardening it."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3069"],[0,"The Great Boer War (#19)"],[1," so  that the advancing infantry alternately dipped into shelter and emerged  into a hail of bullets. The line of advance was dotted with khaki-clad  figures, some still in death, some writhing in their agony. Amid the  litter of bodies a major of the Gordons, shot through the leg, sat  philosophically smoking his pipe. Plucky little Chisholm, Colonel of the  Imperials, had fallen with two mortal wounds as he dashed forward waving  a coloured sash in the air. So long was the advance and so trying the  hill that the men sank panting upon the ground, and took their breath  before making another rush. As at Talana Hill, regimental formation was  largely gone, and men of the Manchesters, Gordons, and Imperial Light  Horse surged upwards in one long ragged fringe, Scotchman, Englishman,  and British Africander keeping pace in that race of death. And now at  last they began to see their enemy. Here and there among the boulders  in front of them there was the glimpse of a slouched hat, or a peep at  a flushed bearded face which drooped over a rifle barrel. There was a  pause, and then with a fresh impulse the wave of men gathered themselves  together and flung themselves forward. Dark figures sprang up from the  rocks in front. Some held up their rifles in token of surrender. Some  ran with heads sunk between their shoulders, jumping and ducking among  the rocks. The panting breathless climbers were on the edge of the  plateau. There were the two guns which had flashed so brightly, silenced  now, with a litter of dead gunners around them and one wounded officer  standing by a trail. A small body of the Boers still resisted. Their  appearance horrified some of our men. 'They were dressed in black  frock coats and looked like a lot of rather seedy business men,' said a  spectator. 'It seemed like murder to kill them.' Some surrendered, and  some fought to the death where they stood. Their leader Koch, an old  gentleman with a white beard, lay amidst the rocks, wounded in three  places. He was treated with all courtesy and attention, but died in  Ladysmith Hospital some days afterwards.    In the meanwhile the Devonshire Regiment had waited until the attack  had developed and had then charged the hill upon the flank, while  the artillery moved up until it was within 2000 yards of the enemy's  position. The Devons met with a less fierce resistance than the others,  and swept up to the summit in time to head off some of the fugitives.  The whole of our infantry were now upon the ridge.    But even so these dour fighters were not beaten. They clung desperately  to the further edges of the plateau, firing from behind the rocks.  There had been a race for the nearest gun between an officer of the  Manchesters and a drummer sergeant of the Gordons. The officer won, and  sprang in triumph on to the piece. Men of all regiments swarmed round  yelling and cheering, when upon their astonished ears there sounded the  'Cease fire' and then the 'Retire.' It was incredible, and yet it pealed  out again, unmistakable in its urgency. With the instinct of discipline  the men were slowly falling back. And then the truth of it came upon  the minds of some of them. The crafty enemy had learned our bugle calls.  'Retire be damned! shrieked a little bugler, and blew the 'Advance' with  all the breath that the hillside had left him. The men, who had retired  a hundred yards and uncovered the guns, flooded back over the plateau,  and in the Boer camp which lay beneath it a white flag showed that  the game was up. A squadron of the 5th Lancers and of the 5th Dragoon  Guards, under Colonel Gore of the latter regiment, had prowled round  the base of the hill, and in the fading light they charged through and  through the retreating Boers, killing several, and making from twenty to  thirty prisoners. It was one of the very few occasions in the war where  the mounted Briton overtook the mounted Boer.    'What price Majuba?' was the cry raised by some of the infantry as they  dashed up to the enemy's position, and the action may indeed be said to  have been in some respects the converse of that famous fight. It is true  that there were many more British at Elandslaagte than Boers at Majuba,  but then the defending force was much more numerous also, and the  British had no guns there. It is true, also, that Majuba is very much  more precipitous than Elandslaagte, but then every practical soldier  knows that it is easier to defend a moderate glacis than an abrupt  slope, which gives cover under its boulders to the attacker while the  defender has to crane his head over the edge to look down. On the whole,  this brilliant little action may be said to have restored things to  their true proportion, and to have shown that, brave as the Boers  undoubtedly are, there is no military feat within their power which  is not equally possible to the British soldier. Talana Hill and  Elandslaagte, fought on successive days, were each of them as gallant an  exploit as Majuba.    We had more to show for our victory than for the previous one at Dundee.  Two Maxim-Nordenfeld guns, whose efficiency had been painfully evident  during the action, were a welcome addition to our artillery. Two hundred  and fifty Boers were killed and wounded and about two hundred taken  prisoners, the loss falling most heavily upon the Johannesburgers, the  Germans, and the Hollanders. General Koch, Dr. Coster, Colonel Schiel,  Pretorius, and other well-known Transvaalers fell into our hands. Our  own casualty list consisted of 41 killed and 220 wounded, much the same  number as at Talana Hill, the heaviest losses falling upon the Gordon  Highlanders and the Imperial Light Horse.    In the hollow where the Boer tents had stood, amid the laagered wagons  of the vanquished, under a murky sky and a constant drizzle of rain, the  victors spent the night. Sleep was out of the question, for all night  the fatigue parties were searching the hillside and the wounded were  being carried in. Camp-fires were lit and soldiers and prisoners crowded  round them, and it is pleasant to recall that the warmest corner and the  best of their rude fare were always reserved for the downcast Dutchmen,  while words of rude praise and sympathy softened the pain of defeat. It  is the memory of such things which may in happier days be more potent  than all the wisdom of statesmen in welding our two races into one.    Having cleared the Boer force from the line of the railway, it is  evident that General White could not continue to garrison the point, as  he was aware that considerable forces were moving from the north,  and his first duty was the security of Ladysmith. Early next morning  (October 22nd), therefore, his weary but victorious troops returned  to the town. Once there he learned, no doubt, that General Yule had  no intention of using the broken railway for his retreat, but that he  intended to come in a circuitous fashion by road. White's problem was  to hold tight to the town and at the same time to strike hard at any  northern force so as to prevent them from interfering with Yule's  retreat. It was in the furtherance of this scheme that he fought upon  October 24th the action of Rietfontein, an engagement slight in itself,  but important on account of the clear road which was secured for the  weary forces retiring from Dundee.    The army from the Free State, of which the commando vanquished at  Elandslaagte was the vanguard, had been slowly and steadily debouching  from the passes, and working south and eastwards to cut the line between  Dundee and Ladysmith. It was White's intention to prevent them from  crossing the Newcastle Road, and for this purpose he sallied out of  Ladysmith on Tuesday the 24th, having with him two regiments of cavalry,  the 5th Lancers and the 19th Hussars, the 42nd and 53rd field batteries  with the 10th mountain battery, four infantry regiments, the Devons,  Liverpools, Gloucesters, and 2nd King's Royal Rifles, the Imperial Light  Horse, and the Natal Volunteers--some four thousand men in all.    The enemy were found to be in possession of a line of hills within  seven miles of Ladysmith, the most conspicuous of which is called Tinta  Inyoni. It was no part of General White's plan to attempt to drive him  from this position--it is not wise generalship to fight always upon  ground of the enemy's choosing--but it was important to hold him where  he was, and to engage his attention during this last day of the march  of the retreating column. For this purpose, since no direct attack was  intended, the guns were of more importance than the infantry--and indeed  the infantry should, one might imagine, have been used solely as an  escort for the artillery. A desultory and inconclusive action ensued  which continued from nine in the morning until half-past one in the  afternoon. A well-directed fire of the Boer guns from the hills was  dominated and controlled by our field artillery, while the advance of  their riflemen was restrained by shrapnel. The enemy's guns were more  easily marked down than at Elandslaagte, as they used black powder. The  ranges varied from three to four thousand yards. Our losses in the  whole action would have been insignificant had it not happened that the  Gloucester Regiment advanced somewhat incautiously into the open and was  caught in a cross fire of musketry which struck down Colonel Wilford and  fifty of his officers and men. Within four days Colonel Dick-Cunyngham,  of the Gordons, Colonel Chisholm, of the Light Horse, Colonel Gunning,  of the Rifles, and now Colonel Wilford, of the Gloucesters, had all  fallen at the head of their regiments. In the afternoon General White,  having accomplished his purpose and secured the safety of the Dundee  column while traversing the dangerous Biggarsberg passes, withdrew his  force to Ladysmith. We have no means of ascertaining the losses of the  Boers, but they were probably slight. On our side we lost"]]]
