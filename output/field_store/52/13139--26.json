This production of fresh individuals enlarges the parent  colony, but could not be the means of founding a new one, which is  accomplished by two other modes. A little way down the cells Professor  Allman discovered an ovary attached to the internal tube by a short  _peduncle_, or foot stalk, while a testis or male generative organ is  attached to the _funiculus_, or \"little rope,\" we have already  described.    July and August are the best times for observing the ovaries, and they  are most conspicuous in the genera _Alcyonella_ and _Paludicella_. True  eggs are developed in the ovaries in a manner resembling this mode of  multiplication in other animals; but there is another kind of egg, or,  perhaps to speak more properly, a variety of bud, which is extremely  curious. In looking at our specimens we noticed brown oval bodies in the  cells; these, on careful examination, presented the appearance of the  sketch. The centre is dark, covered with a network, which is more  conspicuous in the lighter coloured and more transparent margins. These  curious bodies are produced from the funiculus, and act as reserves of  propagative force, as they are not hatched or developed until they get  out and find themselves exposed to appropriate circumstances. Professor  Allman names them _Statoblasts_, or stationary germs, and they bear some  resemblance to what are called the \"winter eggs\" of some other  creatures. The Professor was never able to discover any mode by which  they were permitted to escape from the cells, and in our colonies none  were allowed to leave their homes until the death of their parent, and  the decomposition of its cell had taken place; a process which went on  contemporaneously with the growth of new cells, until the plant on which  the _coenoecium_ was situated, rotted away, and then unfortunately  the whole concern went to pieces.    [Illustration: Plumatella repens on a leaf.]    The tubes of the _Plumatella_, and of most other Polyzoa, are composed  of two coats, called respectively _endocyst_ and _ectocyst_, that is,  \"inner case\" and \"outer case.\" The first is vitally endowed, and  exhibits vessels and muscular fibres. The second or outer case is thrown  off by the first. It is a parchment-like substance, strengthened by the  adhesion of dirt particles, and does not appear to exercise any vital  functions, but to be merely a covering for protection. The inner layer  terminates in the neck of the bag before described, as exserted when the  polypide comes out, and inverted when it goes in. This mode of making a  case or sheath by inversion of a bag is technically called  _invagination_, and is readily seen in new and transparent cells.    The movement of _eversion_, or coming out, is chiefly produced by the  contraction of the endocyst; while the _inversion_, or getting in again,  is performed by the long muscles, which, when the animal is extended,  are seen attached to it like ropes. Upon these muscles Professor Allman  remarks that they are \"especially interesting in a physiological point  of view, as they seem to present us with an example of true muscular  tissue, reduced to its simplest and essential form. A muscle may here  be viewed as a beautiful dissection far surpassing the most refined  preparation of the dissecting needle, for it is composed of a bundle of  elementary fibres, totally separate from one another through their  entire course.\" He further adds, \"The fibres of the great retractor  muscle are distinctly marked by transverse striae;--a condition, however,  which is not at all times equally perceptible, and some of our best  observers have denied to the Polyzoon the existence of striated fibre.\"    We can confirm the fact of this sort of fibre being present, but we  fancy a reader not versed in the mysteries of physiology exclaiming,  'What does it matter whether his fibres are striped or not?'    Physiologists used to suppose there was a strong and marked distinction  and separation between _striped_ muscles, that is, muscles the fibres of  which exhibit transverse stripes when magnified, and those which do not.  Koelliker, however, says this decided separation can no longer be  maintained,[23] and he gives instances in proof of the connections that  can be traced between the two forms. In the higher animals the striped  muscles are the special instruments of _will_, and of movements that  follow, or are accompanied by, distinct sensations. Striped fibre must  be regarded as the highest form; and as a muscle of this sort contracts  in length it increases uniformly in breadth.    [23] 'Manual of Human Microscopic Anatomy,' p. 63.    There are many other genera and species of fresh-water polyzoa besides  the _Plumatella repens_, and they are found attached to sticks, stones,  or leaves, generally to the under surface of the latter. They are all  objects of great interest and beauty, which, whatever their diversity,  conform sufficiently to one type that the student who has observed one,  will easily recognise the zoological position of another. They should be  viewed by transmitted and by dark-ground illumination, which produces  very beautiful effects. To observe them in the performance of their  functions, they require more room than the live-box can afford, but are  well shown in the glass trough, whose moveable diaphragm enables them to  be brought near enough to the object-glass, for the use of a power of  about sixty linear for general purposes, and of from one to two hundred  for the examination of particular parts. For a more detailed examination  dissection must be employed, but all that we have mentioned can be seen  without injury to the living animal, if specimens are kept till new  cells are formed in water, which does not contain enough dirt to render  their integuments opaque.

There is always satisfaction in finding a work accomplished; but the  attempt to delineate some of the marvels of minute creation has been a  pleasant one, and we approach the completion of our task of recording a  _Microscopic Year_ with something like regret. The dark, dirty December  of the great metropolis may not seem a promising time for field  excursions, but some ponds lie near enough to practicable roads and  paths to render an occasional dip in them, not of ourselves, but of our  bottles--an easy and not unpleasant performance; and if the weather is  unusually bad, we can fall back upon our preserves in bottles and tanks,  which seldom fail to afford something new, as we have been pretty sure  to bring home some undeveloped germs with our stock of pond-water and  plants, and even creatures of considerable size are very likely to have  escaped detection in our first efforts at examination.    When objects are not over abundant, as is apt to be the case in the cold  months, it is well to fill a large vial with some water out of the  aquarium or other large vessel, and watch what living specks may be  moving about therein. These are readily examined with a pocket-lens, and  with a little dexterity any promising creature can be fished out with  the dipping-tube. It is also advisable to shake a mass of vegetation in  a white basin, as the larger infusoria, &c., may be thrown down; and  indeed this method (as recommended by Pritchard) is always convenient.  Even so small a quantity of water as is contained in a glass cell,  appropriated to the continual examination of polyps or polyzoa, should  be frequently hunted over with a low power, as in the course of days and  weeks one race of small animals will disappear, and another take their  place.    Following these various methods in December, we obtained many specimens;  but the most interesting was found by taking up small branches of the  Anacharis with a pair of forceps, and putting them into a glass trough  to see what inhabitants they might possess. One of these trials was  rewarded by the appearance of a little puppy-shaped animal very busy  pawing about with eight imperfect legs, but not making much progress  with all his efforts. It was evident that we had obtained one of the  _Tardigrada_ (slow-steppers), or Water-Bears, and a very comical amusing  little fellow he was. The figure was like that of a new-born puppy, or  \"unlicked\" bear cub; each of the eight legs were provided with four  serviceable claws, there was no tail, and the blunt head was susceptible  of considerable alteration of shape. He was grubbing about among some  bits of decayed vegetation, and from the mass of green matter in his  stomach, it was evident that he was not one of that painfully numerous  class in England--the starving poor.    [Illustration: Water-Bear.]    A power of one hundred and five linear, obtained with a two-thirds  object-glass, and the second eye-piece, enabled all his motions and  general structure to be exhibited, and showed that he possessed a sort  of gizzard, whose details would require more magnification to bring out.  Accordingly the dipping-tube was carefully held just over him, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36924"],[0,"The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci, and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career (#19)"],[1," the said office, and to do and comply  with all the things in this our letter or appertaining to it; and for  their accomplishment and execution give all the favour and help that is  needful for all that is here, and for each part of it; and that the above  may come to the knowledge of all, and that none may pretend ignorance,  we order that this our letter shall be read before the public notary,  in the markets and open spaces, and other accustomed places in the said  city of Seville, and in the city of Cadiz, and in all the other cities,  towns, and villages of these kingdoms and lordships; and if hereafter  any person or persons act against it, the said justices shall execute  upon them the penalties contained in this letter, so that the above  shall be observed and shall take effect without fail; and if the one or  the others do not so comply, they shall be subject to a fine of 10,000  maravedis for our chamber.

It is manifest that the Admiral Don Cristobal Colon was the first by  whom Divine Providence ordained that this, our great continent should  be discovered, and chose him for the instrument through whom all these  hitherto unknown Indies should be shown to the world. He saw it on  Wednesday, the 1st of August, one day after he discovered the island of  Trinidad, in the year of our salvation, 1498.[141] He gave it the name  of Isla Santa, believing that it was an island. He then began to enter  the Gulf of La Bellena, by the entrance called the mouth of the Serpent  by him, finding all the water fresh, and it is this entrance which forms  the island of Trinidad, separating it from the mainland called Santa. On  the following Friday, being the 3rd of August, he discovered the point  of Paria, which he also believed to be an island, giving it the name of  Gracia. But all was mainland, as in due time appeared, and still more  clearly now is it known that here there is an immense continent.    It is well here to consider the injury and injustice which that Americo  Vespucio appears to have done to the Admiral, or that those have done  who published his _Four Navigations_, in attributing the discovery of  this continent to himself, without mentioning anyone but himself. Owing  to this, all the foreigners who write of these Indies in Latin, or in  their own mother-tongue, or who make charts or maps, call the continent  America, as having been first discovered by Americo.    For as Americo was a Latinist, and eloquent, he knew how to make use of  the first voyage he undertook, and to give the credit to himself, as  if he had been the principal captain of it. He was only one of those  who were with the captain, Alonso de Hojeda, either as a mariner, or  because, as a trader, he had contributed towards the expenses of the  expedition; but he secured notoriety by dedicating his _Navigations_  to King Rene of Naples.[142] Certainly these _Navigations_ unjustly  usurp from the Admiral the honour and privilege of having been the first  who, by his labours, industry, and the sweat of his brow, gave to Spain  and to the world a knowledge of this continent, as well as of all the  Western Indies. Divine Providence reserved this honour and privilege  for the Admiral Don Cristobal Colon, and for no other. For this reason  no one can presume to usurp the credit, nor to give it to himself or  to another, without wrong, injustice, and injury committed against the  Admiral, and consequently without offence against God.    In order that this truth may be made manifest, I will here relate  truthfully, and impartially, the information on the subject which I  possess. To understand the matter it is necessary to bear in mind that  the Admiral left San Lucar, on his third voyage, on the 30th of May 1498,  and arrived at the Cape Verde Islands on the 27th of June. He sighted  the island of Trinidad on Tuesday, the 31st of July, and soon afterwards,  on Wednesday, the 1st of August, he saw the continent to the south of a  strait two leagues wide, between it and the island of Trinidad. He called  this strait the \"mouth of the Serpent\", and the mainland, believing it to  be an island, he named Isla Sancta. Presently, on the following Friday,  he sighted and discovered Paria, which he called Isla de Gracia, thinking  that it also was an island. An account of all these discoveries, with  a painted outline of the land, was sent by the Admiral to the Sovereigns.    This being understood, we shall now see when Americo Vespucio set out, and  with whom, to discover and trade in those parts. Those who may read this  history must know that, at that time, Alonso de Hojeda was in Castille,  when the account of the discovery and of the form of that land arrived,  which was sent by the Admiral to the Sovereigns. This report and map came  into the hands of the Bishop Don Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, afterwards  Bishop of Palencia, who had charge of all business connected with the  Indies from the beginning, and was then Archdeacon of Seville. The said  Alonso de Hojeda was a great favourite of the Bishop, and when the report  of the Admiral and the map arrived, Fonseca suggested to Hojeda to go and  make more discoveries in the same direction as the Admiral had taken. For  when the thread is discovered and placed in the hand, it is an easy  matter to reach the skein. Hojeda was aided by the information which the  Admiral had collected from the Indians when he served in the first voyage,  that there was a continent behind the lands and islands then reached. As  he had the favour and goodwill of the Bishop, he looked out for persons  who would fit out some ships, for he himself had not sufficient funds.  As he was known in Seville as a brave and distinguished man, he found,  either there, or perhaps at the port of Santa Maria, whence he sailed,  some one who enabled him to fit out four ships. The Sovereigns gave  him his commission and instructions, and appointed him captain, for the  discovery and purchase of gold and pearls, a fifth being reserved as the  royal share, and to treat of peace and friendship with people he should  meet with during the expedition.    Thus the first who went to discover after the Admiral was no other than  Alonso de Hojeda. Those whom he took, and wanted to take in his company,  consisted of the sailors who were acquainted with the voyage to those  lands, who were none others but those who had come and gone with the  Admiral. Those were the principal mariners of the time. One of them  was Juan de la Cosa Biscayan,[143] who went with the Admiral when he  discovered this island, and was afterwards with him in the Cuba and  Jamaica discovery, the most laborious voyage up to that time. Hojeda also  took with him the pilot Bartolome Roldan, who was well known in this  city of San Domingo, and who built, from their foundations, a great  number of the houses now standing in the four streets. He too had been  with the Admiral in his first voyage, and also in the discovery of Paria  and the mainland. Hojeda also took the said Americo, and I do not know  whether as pilot, or as a man instructed in navigation and learned in  cosmography. For it appears that Hojeda puts him among the pilots he  took with him.    I gather from the prologue he addressed to King Rene of Naples, in the  book of his four _Navigations_, that the said Americo was a merchant,  for so he confesses. Probably he contributed some money towards the  expenses of fitting-out the four ships, with the condition of receiving  a proportionate share of the profits. Although Americo asserts that the  King of Castille sent out the expedition, and that they went to discover  by his order, this is not true. Three or four, or ten, persons combined,  who were possessed of some money, and begged and even importuned the  Sovereigns for permission to go and discover and search, with the object  of promoting their own profits and interests. Thus Hojeda, owing to his  having got possession of the chart which the Admiral had sent home of  the mainland he had discovered, for the Sovereigns, and owing to his  having with him the pilots and mariners who had been with the Admiral,  came to discover the further part of the mainland, which will be described  in chapter 166.    It is a thing well known, and established by many witnesses, that Americo  went with Alonso de Hojeda, and that Hojeda went after the Admiral had  discovered the mainland. It is also proved by Alonso de Hojeda himself.  He was produced as a witness in favour of the Crown, when the Admiral Don  Diego Colon, next and legitimate successor of the Admiral Don Cristobal  Colon, had a lawsuit with the Crown for all the estate of which his father  had been dispossessed, as he was by the same cause. Alonso de Hojeda  testifies as follows, in his reply to the second question. He was asked \"if  he knew that the Admiral Don Cristobal Colon had not discovered any part of  what is now called mainland, except when he once touched at the part called  Paria?\" The answer of Hojeda was that the Admiral touched at the island  of Trinidad, and passed between that island and the \"Boca del Drago\",  which is Paria, and that he sighted the island of Margarita.
