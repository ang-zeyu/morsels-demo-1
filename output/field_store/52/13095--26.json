It has been seen swarming in a teasel-field, near  Selby, Yorkshire.    Its predilection for settling on bramble sprays has been alluded to on page  47.           *       *       *       *       *    THE DARK-GREEN FRITILLARY. (_Argynnis Aglaia._)    (Plate X. fig. 1, Male.)    This is a handsomely-marked insect--orange-brown, chequered with black,  above. Beneath, the _front wing_ is coloured nearly as above, _but bears  near the tip several silvery spots_. The hind wing is splendidly studded  with rounded spots of silver, on a ground partly tawny, partly olive-green  and brown. The _male_ is the sex {130} represented, the female being darker  above, both as to the ground colour and markings.    The _caterpillar_, which feeds on the dog-violet, is very similar to that  of the last; as also is the _chrysalis_.    The _butterfly_ is out in July and part of August, and may be seen in a  variety of situations, from the breezy tops of heathy downs, to close-grown  forest-lands in the valleys; and it seems to be distributed over the whole  of the country, occurring in widely distant localities, from the south  coast to Scotland.           *       *       *       *       *    THE HIGH-BROWN FRITILLARY. (_Argynnis Adippe._)    (Plate X. fig. 2.)    On the upper surface, this insect so closely resembles the last, that it is  difficult in a description to discriminate between them; but _beneath_, the  two are distinguished by the _absence in Adippe of the silvery spots near  the tip of the front wing_; and though there is some similarity in the  arrangement of the silver spots on the hind wing, and in its general  colouring, _Adippe_ is distinguished by a row of rust-red spots, with small  silvery centres, between the silver border spots and the next row inwards.  By comparing the figures of the under sides of _Adippe_ and _Aglaia_, these  will be readily made out. {131}    The _caterpillar_ is thorny, greyish, with black spots on the back,  intersected by a white line. Feeds on the violet.    The _chrysalis_ is reddish, spotted with silver.    The _butterfly_ appears in July, in many open places, in woods, and on  heaths, in various parts of England, but most plentifully in the south.  Like the last species, it is an active and wary insect on the wing, and  requires considerable agility and dexterity for its capture.           *       *       *       *       *    THE QUEEN OF SPAIN FRITILLARY. (_Argynnis Lathonia._)    (Plate X. fig. 3.)    This splendid little species is one of the prize-flies of the  collector--that is, if the specimen be an undoubted native; for while a  \"Queen of Spain\" taken within our shores will command a considerable sum of  money in the market, another, precisely similar, but brought over from the  opposite French coast, may be bought for a very few pence; but the mode of  carriage, you see, makes all the difference, and the value of the insect  depends entirely upon whether its own wings or a steam-boat have brought it  over the Channel. So much for \"the fancy.\"    When figured side by side with the other Fritillaries, this species looks  distinct enough from any of them; {132} but it has been several times  confounded with small specimens of _Adippe_ and with _Euphrosyne_, and its  capture has thereupon been erroneously published; but this must have been  the effect of a description imperfectly written or read. It will be  observed that the form of the front wings differs in this from the rest of  the Fritillaries, the outer margin being _concave_ in its outline. The  inner corner of the hind wings also is more sharply angular.    Above, the colouring of the wings is similar to that of the others of the  genus, tawny-brown and black. Beneath, the front wing has a group of silver  spots near the tip, the ground colour of the hind wing is yellowish, and  the silver spots are proportionately larger than in the other species;  _near the margin of the hind wing_, and parallel with its edge, are _seven  dark-brown spots with silver centres_.    The _caterpillar_ is brown, striped with white, and yellowish tint; head,  legs, and thorns, tawny coloured. It feeds on the wild heartsease, also on  sainfoin and borage.    The _chrysalis_ is tinted with dull-green and brown, and spotted with gold.    The _butterfly_ is said to be double-brooded--one brood appearing in June,  the other in September. The most likely places in which to look for it are  clover fields in the south of England, and more especially on the  south-east coast. Though still classed among the rarest of British  butterflies, it has been found in a great many localities. It has been  taken at Brighton; Shoreham; Eastbourne; Dover; Margate; Ashford; Chatham;  Exeter; Bristol; Harleston, near Norwich; Colchester; Lavenham;  Peterborough.    [Illustration: XIII.]    {133}    THE PEARL-BORDERED FRITILLARY. (_Argynnis Euphrosyne._)    (Plate X. fig. 4.)    This very common insect is considerably smaller than any of the preceding  species, though small specimens of the last sometimes do not much exceed it  in size. The upper surface is lively orange-brown, with black markings.  Beneath, the _hind wing_ is mapped out with black lines into various  irregular spaces, _all_ of which are filled with tints of dull yellow,  ochreous, or reddish orange; excepting a row of silver spots on the border,  _one silver spot in the centre of the wing_, and _one_ triangular one close  to the root of the wing.    The _caterpillar_ is black, with white lines; and the pro-legs red. It  feeds on various species of _viola_.    The _butterfly_ appears first in May, and there is another brood in autumn,  about August. It frequents woods and hedgerows, being met with most  profusely in the south; but its range is extended into Scotland. In Ireland  I believe it is unknown.           *       *       *       *       *    {134}    THE SMALL PEARL-BORDERED FRITILLARY. (_Argynnis Selene._)    (Plate XI. fig. 1.)    This butterfly, which is very nearly related to the last, often so closely  resembles it in the marking of the upper surface, that even practised eyes  are sometimes at a loss to distinguish the two, without a reference to the  under side; for on this side do the real distinctive marks lie, and chiefly  on the hind wing. In addition to the silver border and central spots of  _Euphrosyne_, this species has several other silvery or pearly patches  distributed over the hind wing; and the reddish-orange colour adjoining the  silver border in _Euphrosyne_ is exchanged for dark chestnut-brown in  _Selene_. In average size the two insects differ very slightly, though the  name of this expresses an inferior size.    The _caterpillar_ much resembles that of the last, and feeds on  violet-leaves.    The _chrysalis_ is greyish.    The _butterfly_ is double-brooded, appearing first in May and again in  August. It is not so common an insect as _Euphrosyne_, but is met with in  similar situations, and has a range nearly co-extensive with that of the  latter.           *       *       *       *       *    {135}    THE GLANVILLE FRITILLARY. (_Melitaea Cinxia._)    (Plate XI. fig. 2.)    Though usually rather abundant where it occurs at all, this insect is one  of the most local of all our butterflies, and I can only find recorded  about a dozen places for it in the country. Of these, the Isle of Wight is  the great metropolis of the insect, and there, in many places round the  coast, numerous colonies have been established.    This butterfly is distinguished from the next (_M. Athalia_), which it very  much resembles, principally by the characters on the under surface.    The hind wing (beneath) is covered with alternate bands of bright  straw-colour and orange-brown, divided by black lines; and possesses in  _the marginal straw-coloured band a row of clear_ BLACK SPOTS. Another row  of black spots crosses the centre of the wing. It will also be observed  that the _hind wings_ have on _their upper surface a row of black spots_  parallel with, and not far from, the margin. The colouring of the upper  side is orange-brown with black markings.    The _caterpillar_, which feeds on the narrow-leaved plantain, is thorny and  black, with reddish head and legs. The chrysalis is brownish, marked with  fulvous tint. A highly interesting account of the habits and {136} history  of this butterfly in all its stages has been sketched from the life by the  Rev. J. F. Dawson (who has made an intimate acquaintance with a colony of  the insect at Sandown, Isle of Wight), and will be found in the  _Zoologist_, p. 1271.    The _butterfly_ first appears about the first or second week in May, and  thence continues till about the middle of June, seldom enduring till July.  It is to be looked for in rough, broken ground, such as the Isle of Wight  landslips, where plenty of the narrow-leaved plantain grows.    Other localities for the Glanville Fritillary are, Folkestone below  West-Cliff (abundant); round Dover; Birchwood; Dartford, Kent; Stapleford,  near Cambridge; Yorkshire; Lincolnshire; Wiltshire; Peterboro', Stowmarket;  and in Scotland, at Falkland in Fifeshire.           *       *       *       *       *    THE PEARL-BORDERED LIKENESS FRITILLARY. (_Melitaea Athalia._)    (Plate XI. fig. 3.)    This is another very local butterfly, though rather more widely and  generally distributed than the last, which, as before stated, it greatly  resembles in appearance, especially on the upper side. {137}    It may be characterised negatively as _not_ having the rows of black spots  found on both surfaces of _Cinxia_, though its colouring is very  similar--fulvous (or orange-brown) and black above; straw-coloured,  fulvous, and black beneath.    The _caterpillar_ is black, with rust-coloured spines; and feeds on various  species of plantain.    The _butterfly_ is out from May to July, and is met with (if at all) on  heaths, clearings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33965"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 4, July, 1851 (#19)"],[1,"lachrymose romance of _Raphael_, has passed  into a third edition in Paris.           *       *       *       *       *    The French poet MERY has just published a romance entitled _Confessions  de Marion Delorme_. We cannot imagine any additional interest from  fictitious coloring to a life such as it is believed was really led by  the heroine.         \"Marion Delorme was born in 1612 or 1615, but where is not       exactly known, though probably in Champagne or Franche       Comte. Of marvellous beauty and exquisite wit, she became,       after certain amatory adventures, the mistress, and       subsequently by secret marriage the wife, of Cinq Mars, and,       as such, was persecuted by the terrible Cardinal Richelieu.       Even before he was sent to the scaffold, she had formed       other intrigues, and then had a long list of lovers, amongst       whom were de Grammont and Saint Evremont; then she became       the 'glass of fashion and the mould of form, the observed of       all observers,' and the admired of all gallants of the good       city of Paris; then she dabbled in politics, and eventually       became one of the chiefs of the malcontent party; then she       was in danger of arrest, like the Princes de Conti and de       Conde; then to escape a jail she spread a rumor that she was       dead, and actually got up a mock funeral of herself;       afterwards, she escaped to England, married a lord, and in a       short time became a widow with a legacy of L4000; then she       returned to France, and on her way to Paris was attacked by       brigands, robbed of her money, and made to marry the chief       of the band; four years later she was again a widow, and       then she wedded a M. Laborde; after living with him       seventeen years, he died, and she went to Paris with the       remains of her fortune; robbed by her domestics, she was       reduced to beggary, and continued to lead a wretched       existence to the extraordinary age of one hundred and       thirty-four!\"           *       *       *       *       *    M.

THACKERAY, who promises to come and see us, and who, of course, will  talk about us with the world afterwards, is delivering a course of six  lectures in London upon the English humorists. The first was good, and  as good as was expected, which is great praise--for few things are so  difficult as for a famous man to satisfy public expectation. The London  _Leader_ thus speaks of it:         \"On Thursday the great satiric painter of social life--the       Fielding of our times--commenced at Willis's rooms the first       of those 'Lectures on the English Humorists of the       Eighteenth Century,' which many months ago we announced as       in preparation. We have never heard a lecture that delighted       us more. It was thoughtful and picturesque, with some       wonderful traces of pathos and far-reaching sentences.       Dwelling upon the moral aspects of Swift's position and       career, rather than attempting a criticism on his works,       Thackeray held his audience from first to last. He gave a       vivid picture of the early life and loneliness of the great       satirist amidst the exasperating servilities and insults       endured from Temple's household, as also of the turbulent       political bravo coming up to London to carve for himself a       pathway among lords whom he despised. In this part of the       lecture it was felt that, while satirizing that condition of       political corruption which made Swift a bravo, and used him       as such, the censor still touched upon living foibles; at       the allusion to the South Sea Bubble, with its railway       parallel, we observed some fair shoulders wince! Nor were       religious cant and formalism untouched in the admirable       picture of Swift's sacrifice of his life to an hypocrisy.       The audience was of the elite--Thomas Carlyle, Macaulay,       Milman, Milnes, Sir Robert Inglis, the Duke and Duchess of       Argyle, the Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Constance Leveson       Gower, Lady Lichfield, with many others, not a few lovely       women, and several men well known in literature and art.\"    Of his second lecture we quote the _Times_:         \"The heroes of his second lecture were Congreve and Addison.       For Congreve, while he admitted the brilliancy of his wit,       he evinced no great respect. He characterized him as the       greatest literary \"swell\" that ever lived. With an air of       greatness, Congreve put on his best clothes, stalked among       wits who all thronged to admire him, however eminent they       might be, and approached fine ladies with a certainty of       conquest. The \"I am the great Mr. Congreve!\" was the       complacent ejaculation which seemed to break through all he       said and did. His character as a man of gallantry was       illustrated by citations from his poems, in which he       adulates or insults the ladies whom he immortalizes, and       every where appears as the irresistible seducer, sure to be       victorious in the end. And who could resist that very great       Mr. Congreve, with his very fine coat, squeezing a hand,       covered with diamonds, through the ringlets of a dishevelled       periwig? Of the moral principle of his comedies Mr.       Thackeray spoke with disgust, and traced the worship of       youth and recklessness, and the disrespect of old age, which       are such leading characteristics in those brilliant works,       through a whole series of dramatic categories from the       comedy to the puppet-show. The constant tendency, he       humorously described, is a recommendation to \"Eat and drink,       and go to the deuce, when your time comes, if deuce there       be; and he confessed that he regarded these witty banquets       without love as he would contemplate the ruins of Sallust's       house at Pompeii, with all its ghastly relics of festivity.       The foppish depreciation of his own literary productions       with which Congreve met the compliments of Voltaire, Mr.       Thackeray rather commended than otherwise, but not for a       reason which would have pleased the great man. He really did       think his productions worthless, if weighed against one       kindly line of Steele or Addison.         \"Addison is evidently Mr. Thackeray's favorite of the       'humorists' he has brought before the public. If Swift was       the most wretched of mankind, Addison appeared to him as the       most amiable. He admired the serene, calm character, who       could walk so majestically among his fellow-creatures, and       viewing with love all below him, could raise his eyes with       adoration to the blue sky above. He admitted that Addison       was not profound, and that his writings betray no appearance       of suffering--which probably he never knew prior to his       unlucky marriage--but at the same time he expatiated on the       kindliness of his wisdom and the genuine character of his       piety. The foible of drinking he did not attempt to conceal,       but observed that we should have liked Addison less had he       been without it, as we should have liked Sir Roger de       Coverley less without his vanities. Greatly he admired the       gentle spirit of Addison's sarcasm, as distinguished from       the merciless onslaught of Swift, remarking, that in his       mild court only minor cases were tried. Nor were words of       commendation the only means by which Mr. Thackeray indicated       his predilection for Addison. Of Swift he scarcely read a       line; Congreve he illustrated, not by extracts from the       comedies in which he lives for posterity, but by those minor       poems which, though admired by his cotemporaries, are now       little regarded; but he read several extracts from the       _Spectator_, and also Addison's well known hymn, as a       specimen of his deep feeling of devotion. Addison and       Congreve were both prosperous men in a wordly point of view,       and they were therefore introduced with a survey of that       golden age, when an epithalamium on some noble marriage, or       an ode to William III., was rewarded out of the public purse       to an extent that made the poet comfortable for life.       Congreve's first literary achievements earned for him,       through the patronage of Lord Halifax, places in the       commission for licensing hackney-coaches, in the       Custom-house, and in the Pipe-office. 'Alas!' said Mr.       Thackeray, 'there are no Pipe-offices now; the public have       smoked all the pipes!\"      "]]]
