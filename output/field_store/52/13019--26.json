For Sir John Herschel's  hypothesis of an increased retention of heat at the sun's equator, due  to the slightly spheroidal or bulging form of its outer atmospheric  envelope, assuredly gives no sufficient account of such circulatory  movements as he supposed to exist. Nevertheless, the view that the sun's  rotation is intimately connected with the formation of spots is so  obviously correct, that we can only wonder it was not thought of sooner,  while we are even now unable to explain with any certainty _how_ it is  so connected.    Mere scrutiny of the solar surface, however, is not the only means of  solar observation. We have a satellite, and that satellite from time to  time acts most opportunely as a screen, cutting off a part or the whole  of those dazzling rays in which the master-orb of our system veils  himself from over-curious regards. The importance of eclipses to the  study of the solar surroundings is of comparatively recent recognition;  nevertheless, much of what we know concerning them has been snatched, as  it were, by surprise under favour of the moon. In former times, the sole  astronomical use of such incidents was the correction of the received  theories of the solar and lunar movements; the precise time of their  occurrence was the main fact to be noted, and subsidiary phenomena  received but casual attention. Now, their significance as a geometrical  test of tabular accuracy is altogether overshadowed by the interest  attaching to the physical observations for which they afford propitious  occasions. This change may be said to date, in its pronounced form, from  the great eclipse of 1842. Although a necessary consequence of the  general direction taken by scientific progress, it remains associated in  a special manner with the name of Francis Baily.    The \"philosopher of Newbury\" was by profession a London stockbroker, and  a highly successful one. Nevertheless, his services to science were  numerous and invaluable, though not of the brilliant kind which attract  popular notice. Born at Newbury in Berkshire, April 28, 1774, and placed  in the City at the age of fourteen, he derived from the acquaintance of  Dr. Priestley a love of science which never afterwards left him. It was,  however, no passion such as flames up in the brain of the destined  discoverer, but a regulated inclination, kept well within the bounds of  an actively pursued commercial career. After travelling for a year or  two in what were then the wilds of North America, he went on the Stock  Exchange in 1799, and earned during twenty-four years of assiduous  application to affairs a high reputation for integrity and ability, to  which corresponded an ample fortune. In the meantime the Astronomical  Society (largely through his co-operation) had been founded; he had for  three years acted as its secretary, and he now felt entitled to devote  himself exclusively to a subject which had long occupied his leisure  hours. He accordingly in 1825 retired from business, purchased a house  in Tavistock Place, and fitted up there a small observatory. He was,  however, by preference a computator rather than an observer. What Sir  John Herschel calls the \"archaeology of practical astronomy\" found in him  an especially zealous student. He re-edited the star-catalogues of  Ptolemy, Ulugh Beigh, Tycho Brahe, Hevelius, Halley, Flamsteed,  Lacaille, and Mayer; calculated the eclipse of Thales and the eclipse of  Agathocles, and vindicated the memory of the first Astronomer Royal. But  he was no less active in meeting present needs than in revising past  performances. The subject of the reduction of observations, then, as we  have already explained,[150] in a state of deplorable confusion,  attracted his most earnest attention, and he was close on the track of  Bessel when made acquainted with the method of simplification devised at  Koenigsberg. Anticipated as an inventor, he could still be of eminent use  as a promoter of these valuable improvements; and, carrying them out on  a large scale in the star-catalogue of the Astronomical Society  (published in 1827), \"he put\" (in the words of Herschel) \"the  astronomical world in possession of a power which may be said, without  exaggeration, to have changed the face of sidereal astronomy.\"[151]    His reputation was still further enhanced by his renewal, with vastly  improved apparatus, of the method, first used by Henry Cavendish in  1797-98, for determining the density of the earth. From a series of no  less than 2,153 delicate and difficult experiments, conducted at  Tavistock Place during the years 1838-42, he concluded our planet to  weigh 5.66 as much as a globe of water of the same bulk; and this result  slightly corrected is still accepted as a very close approximation of  the truth.    What we have thus glanced at is but a fragment of the truly surprising  mass of work accomplished by Baily in the course of a variously occupied  life. A rare combination of qualities fitted him for his task. Unvarying  health, undisturbed equanimity, methodical habits, the power of directed  and sustained thought, combined to form in him an intellectual toiler of  the surest, though not perhaps of the highest quality. He was in harness  almost to the end. He was destined scarcely to know the miseries of  enforced idleness or of consciously failing powers. In 1842 he completed  the laborious reduction of Lalande's great catalogue, undertaken at the  request of the British Association, and was still engaged in seeing it  through the press when he was attacked with what proved his last, as it  was probably his first serious illness. He, however, recovered  sufficiently to attend the Oxford Commemoration of July 2, 1844, where  an honorary degree of D.C.L. was conferred upon him in company with Airy  and Struve; but sank rapidly after the effort, and died on the 30th of  August following, at the age of seventy, lamented and esteemed by all  who knew him.    It is now time to consider his share in the promotion of solar research.  Eclipses of the sun, both ancient and modern, were a speciality with  him, and he was fortunate in those which came under his observation.  Such phenomena are of three kinds--partial, annular, and total. In a  partial eclipse, the moon, instead of passing directly between us and  the sun, slips by, as it were, a little on one side, thus cutting off  from our sight only a portion of his surface. An annular eclipse, on the  other hand, takes place when the moon is indeed centrally interposed,  but falls short of the apparent size required for the entire concealment  of the solar disc, which consequently remains visible as a bright ring  or annulus, even when the obscuration is at its height. In a total  eclipse, on the contrary, the sun completely disappears behind the dark  body of the moon. The difference of the two latter varieties is due to  the fact that the apparent diameter of the sun and moon are so nearly  equal as to gain alternate preponderance one over the other through the  slight periodical changes in their respective distances from the earth.    Now, on the 15th of May, 1836, an annular eclipse was visible in the  northern parts of Great Britain, and was observed by Baily at Inch  Bonney, near Jedburgh. It was here that he saw the phenomenon which  obtained the name of \"Baily's Beads,\" from the notoriety conferred upon  it by his vivid description.    \"When the cusps of the sun,\" he writes, \"were about 40 deg. asunder, a  row of lucid points, like a string of bright beads, irregular in size  and distance from each other, _suddenly_ formed round that part of the  circumference of the moon that was about to enter on the sun's disc. Its  formation, indeed, was so rapid that it presented the appearance of  having been caused by the ignition of a fine train of gunpowder.  Finally, as the moon pursued her course, the dark intervening spaces  (which, at their origin, had the appearance of lunar mountains in high  relief, and which still continued attached to the sun's border) were  stretched out into long, black, thick, parallel lines, joining the limbs  of the sun and moon; when all at once they _suddenly_ gave way, and left  the circumference of the sun and moon in those points, as in the rest,  comparatively smooth and circular, and the moon perceptibly advanced on  the face of the sun.\"[152]    These curious appearances were not an absolute novelty. Weber in 1791,  and Von Zach in 1820, had seen the \"beads\"; Van Swinden had described  the \"belts\" or \"threads.\"[153] These last were, moreover (as Baily  clearly perceived), completely analogous to the \"black ligament\" which  formed so troublesome a feature in the transits of Venus in 1764 and  1769, and which, to the regret and confusion, though no longer to the  surprise of observers, was renewed in that of 1874. The phenomenon is  largely an effect of what is called _irradiation_, by which a bright  object seems to encroach upon a dark one; but under good atmospheric and  instrumental conditions it becomes inconspicuous. The \"Beads\" must  always appear when the projected lunar edge is serrated with mountains.  In Baily's observation, they were exaggerated and distorted by an  irradiative _clinging together_ of the limbs of sun and moon.    The immediate result, however, was powerfully to stimulate attention to  solar eclipses in their _physical_ aspect. Never before had an  occurrence of the kind been expected so eagerly or prepared for so  actively as that which was total over Central and Southern Europe on the  8th of July, 1842. Astronomers hastened from all quarters to the  favoured region.

Austria was saved again, but having, in her extreme peril  recalled some of her corps from an army engaged in a new invasion of  Serbia, that army was routed and well-nigh destroyed.      GERMANY'S SECOND OFFENSIVE    From December to April the eastern campaign lacked decisive  circumstances. In the north Hindenburg won a new and splendid  victory at the Mazurian Lakes, expelling a Russian army which had  renewed the invasion of East Prussia. In the south the Russians  steadily pushed the Austrians back into the Carpathians, took  Przemysl with more than 125,000 prisoners, and as spring came seemed  on the point of crowning the Carpathians and descending into the  Hungarian Plain.    But the Germans were already organizing their second great  offensive. They were raising new armies, collecting fresh stores of  ammunition and preparing for a thrust against Russia as gigantic as  that against France, with the deliberate purpose of eliminating  Russia from the war. There was no longer any chance of a Napoleonic  success in Europe. But if Russia were eliminated, they could still  hope to win a peace that might leave them Belgium. Some portion of  their plans was spoiled almost as the spring campaign opened, by the  entrance of Italy on the Allies' side, but Italy came too late to  save Russia from the disasters that had begun.    The German plan of campaign was simple. Hindenburg was to strike east  and south from East Prussia at the Russian lines along the  Niemen-Bobr-Narew. Mackensen, having pushed the Russians out of  Galicia, was to strike north through Lublin and toward Brest-Litovsk.  A new army was to invade Courland and aim at Riga. It was the German  hope that the main Russian masses would be caught and enveloped by  Hindenburg and Mackensen, that Poland would be taken and all its  garrisons, and the bulk of the Russian military power be destroyed.    The first blow fell at Gorlice in Galicia in the last days of April.  Mackensen, furnished with the greatest train of artillery war had  ever seen, burst through the Russian lines along the Dunajec,  destroyed Dmitrieff's army, which faced him, almost captured the  Russian Carpathian forces and drove the Russians rapidly beyond the  San, retook first Przemysl and then Lemberg, thus clearing all but a  corner of Galicia.    The main German and Austrian armies were then sent north toward  Brest-Litovsk, while Hindenburg began his thrust by attacking  Ossowetz and the Niemen-Bobr-Narew barrier of forts. By this time  the world knew that Russian ammunition had failed and for many weeks  the possibility of a tremendous Russian disaster existed. Step by  step the Russians were pushed back. The fall of Warsaw was assured  in July and it was not until August that the escape of the Russian  garrison was certain. The same problem was raised about Kovno and  Brest-Litovsk, but again the Russians won clear. Late in August the  final net of the Germans about Vilna was drawn, but for the last  time the Russians eluded it.    And with the battle of Vilna the German eastern campaign practically  ends. In the north the Russians held Riga and the Dwina line, in the  center they were behind the great marshes of Pinsk, to the south  they were behind the Styr and Stripa, still holding Rowno, still  clinging to a corner of Galicia. They had lost hundreds of thousands  of prisoners and many guns. All of Russian Poland, most of Courland,  and much other territory had been surrendered. But they had kept  their armies intact and were once more in line.    In so far as the German campaign had been designed to free Austrian  soil and relieve the pressure upon Austrian and German fronts in the  east, it had been a shining success. It had served, too, to restore  German prestige in the Balkans. But it had come too late to keep  Italy out, and it had not eliminated Russia.    Unless the Germans were prepared to repeat the fatal Napoleonic  march upon Moscow, there was now nothing for them to do but abandon  their eastern campaign for the winter, to dig in and hold until the  spring permitted new operations. But this offered to the Russians a  period of recuperation and rest. In the spring they would have new  armies and fresh artillery. These circumstances were the measure of  the German failure in their second offensive. In their first they  had set out to dispose of France and had suffered defeat at the  Marne. In the second they had undertaken to put Russia out, and  after a long series of victories, Russia had escaped and was now  beyond their grasp.    From the military point of view the Russian failure was even more  serious than the French, because it came a year later, and at the  hour when the superior numbers and resources of the enemies of  Germany were already beginning to tell.      THE THIRD GERMAN OFFENSIVE    The two preceding German campaigns had been based on purely military  considerations. The first was a true Napoleonic conception designed  to grasp a Napoleonic opportunity. The second was partly imposed  upon Germany by Russian success and Austrian failure. There was no  longer a question of destroying the opponents in order, it was a  question of eliminating one and then finding a basis for peace with  the others. The third German campaign, that in the Balkans, was  political quite as much as it was military. It was designed to  provide Germany with some profit for her great sacrifices and her  great losses, but it was no longer a question of the conquest of any  considerable foe.    By the operations of British sea power, Germany had now practically  lost her colonial empire. It was certain that with peace she would  not again be permitted to make use of British colonies or ports, as  she had done before. Her overseas commerce with belligerents and  their colonies was bound to be ruined, even if peace came soon, for  the period of the war it was, of course, abolished.    The entrance of Turkey on the German side had opened for the Germans  a new field for industrial exploitation, if there could once be  opened a road from the Danube to Constantinople. This field would be  beyond the reach of sea power. Once Germany had taken actual command  at Constantinople, once the railroad from Hamburg to the Bosphorus  was open, it was possible to threaten Britain in Egypt, and perhaps  ultimately in India by the Bagdad and Mecca railways.    Such a threat, coupled with one more successful campaign, might  exercise a decisive influence upon the minds of the people of the  allied countries, and in opening a road to the Golden Horn, Germany  might find the path to peace. Already there was apparent willingness  in Berlin to evacuate Belgium and northern France, only from Russia  did Germany now insist upon tribute in the form of conquered  provinces. But until the road to Constantinople was open, until the  Serbian nuisance was abolished, peace could not be considered.    Turkey, too, was calling for aid. Early in the year the Anglo-French  fleets had tried to force the Dardanelles. Their failure had been  followed by a land attack at Gallipoli, which had so far failed, but  Turkish ammunition and artillery was inadequate for a sustained  fight, and there was needed German aid. To lose the Dardanelles was  to see Turkey conquered, Russia provided with munitions, and the  whole German dream of expansion to Asia Minor destroyed.    It was necessary, too, to provide the German people with a new  victory. They had been bitterly disappointed that the Russian  campaign had not brought peace, or, at the least, the elimination of  Russia. A new and relatively cheap success, the conquest of the  Balkans, would fire their imagination and again stimulate their  hopes for a victorious peace. In addition, Bulgaria now beckoned to  the Germans. Her army was at the disposition of the two kaisers, but  there was plain peril that if the coming were too long delayed, the  Allies might succeed in persuading Ferdinand to cast his lot with  the camp that now offered him Serbian Macedonia and Turkish Thrace,  and were suggesting the further _pourboire_ of Greek Kavala.    Accordingly Germany decided to go south, having gone west and east  without finding peace or decisive victory. She had available for  this operation troops no longer needed against Russia since the  campaign on this front had died out, and she had to command it, the  great Mackensen, whose fame now rivaled that of Hindenburg, whose  victories had regained Galicia. \"Constantinople and Peace\" became  the new German watchword, just as \"Paris and Peace\" and \"Warsaw and  Peace\" had been in preceding months.    And at the outset of this third campaign it is perhaps appropriate  to point out that Germany was now to achieve that complete military  success that had been denied to her in France and Russia, she was to  win a victory in the military sense which was beyond cavil, but she  was this time to lose the political profit she had hoped, because  she had mistaken the importance in the minds of her enemies of the  Balkan field and fatally overestimated the war weariness of the  peoples that opposed her. At the Golden Horn she was to find not  peace, but the necessity for new campaigns.      THE SERBIAN PHASE    On the military side the Serbian campaign was the simplest of  operations. For many months the Serbian forces had been posted south  of the Danube and the Save and east of the Drin, looking over their  frontiers into Hungary and Bosnia. Behind them from the Danube at  Belgrade to the Aegean at Saloniki ran the Orient railroad, by which  they were munitioned. At Nish halfway to the sea, the line drew near  to the Bulgarian frontier and sent a branch off, which passed  through Bulgaria and reached Constantinople.    The Saloniki railway was the life line of Serbia, it was also the  natural route for a retreat, if the Austro-German attack became too  heavy. But"]]]
