It    resembles the Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim    population, high structural unemployment, and low standard of    living. The economy's most prominent products are oil, cotton, and    gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in    decline for several years, but the November 1994 ratification of the    $7.5 billion oil deal with a consortium of Western companies should    generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development.    Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet    republics in making the transition from a command to a market    economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its    long-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on    economic reform, and old economic ties and structures have yet to be    replaced. Whereas the economies of most of the former Soviet    republics had begun to bottom out in 1995, Azerbaijan's economy    continued to plummet because of its late start on economic reform.

Increased tourist arrivals have helped spur growth    in the construction and transport sectors. The dual island nation's    agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market;    the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor    shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and    construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for    export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and    electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium    term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized    world, especially in the US, which accounts for about half of all    tourist arrivals.
