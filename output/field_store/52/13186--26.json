[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#19)"],[1,"one of the most important works ever carried out on  the light of the sun. They have for years been analyzing those of its  rays which, although entirely invisible to our eyes, are of the same  nature as those of light, and are felt by us as heat. To do this,  Langley invented a sort of artificial eye, which he called a bolometer,  in which the optic nerve is made of an extremely thin strip of metal,  so slight that one can hardly see it, which is traversed by an electric  current. This eye would be so dazzled by the heat radiated from one's  body that, when in use, it must be protected from all such heat by  being enclosed in a case kept at a constant temperature by being  immersed in water. With this eye the two observers have mapped the heat  rays of the sun down to an extent and with a precision which were  before entirely unknown.    The question of possible changes in the sun's radiation, and of the  relation of those changes to human welfare, still eludes our scrutiny.  With all the efforts that have been made, the physicist of to-day has  not yet been able to make anything like an exact determination of the  total amount of heat received from the sun. The largest measurements  are almost double the smallest. This is partly due to the atmosphere  absorbing an unknown and variable fraction of the sun's rays which pass  through it, and partly to the difficulty of distinguishing the heat  radiated by the sun from that radiated by terrestrial objects.    In one recent instance, a change in the sun's radiation has been  noticed in various parts of the world, and is of especial interest  because there seems to be little doubt as to its origin. In the latter  part of 1902 an extraordinary diminution was found in the intensity of  the sun's heat, as measured by the bolometer and other instruments.  This continued through the first part of 1903, with wide variations at  different places, and it was more than a year after the first  diminution before the sun's rays again assumed their ordinary intensity.    This result is now attributed to the eruption of Mount Pelee, during  which an enormous mass of volcanic dust and vapor was projected into  the higher regions of the air, and gradually carried over the entire  earth by winds and currents. Many of our readers may remember that  something yet more striking occurred after the great cataclasm at  Krakatoa in 1883, when, for more than a year, red sunsets and red  twilights of a depth of shade never before observed were seen in every  part of the world.    What we call universology--the knowledge of the structure and extent of  the universe--must begin with a study of the starry heavens as we see  them. There are perhaps one hundred million stars in the sky within the  reach of telescopic vision. This number is too great to allow of all  the stars being studied individually; yet, to form the basis for any  conclusion, we must know the positions and arrangement of as many of  them as we can determine.    To do this the first want is a catalogue giving very precise positions  of as many of the brighter stars as possible. The principal national  observatories, as well as some others, are engaged in supplying this  want. Up to the present time about 200,000 stars visible in our  latitudes have been catalogued on this precise plan, and the work is  still going on. In that part of the sky which we never see, because it  is only visible from the southern hemisphere, the corresponding work is  far from being as extensive. Sir David Gill, astronomer at the Cape of  Good Hope, and also the directors of other southern observatories, are  engaged in pushing it forward as rapidly as the limited facilities at  their disposal will allow.    Next in order comes the work of simply listing as many stars as  possible. Here the most exact positions are not required. It is only  necessary to lay down the position of each star with sufficient  exactness to distinguish it from all its neighbors. About 400,000 stars  were during the last half-century listed in this way at the observatory  of Bonn by Argelander, Schonfeld, and their assistants. This work is  now being carried through the southern hemisphere on a large scale by  Thome, Director of the Cordoba Observatory, in the Argentine Republic.  This was founded thirty years ago by our Dr. B. A. Gould, who turned it  over to Dr. Thome in 1886. The latter has, up to the present time,  fixed and published the positions of nearly half a million stars. This  work of Thome extends to fainter stars than any other yet attempted, so  that, as it goes on, we have more stars listed in a region invisible in  middle northern latitudes than we have for that part of the sky we can  see. Up to the present time three quarto volumes giving the positions  and magnitudes of the stars have appeared. Two or three volumes more,  and, perhaps, ten or fifteen years, will be required to complete the  work.    About twenty years ago it was discovered that, by means of a telescope  especially adapted to this purpose, it was possible to photograph many  more stars than an instrument of the same size would show to the eye.  This discovery was soon applied in various quarters. Sir David Gill,  with characteristic energy, photographed the stars of the southern sky  to the number of nearly half a million. As it was beyond his power to  measure off and compute the positions of the stars from his plates, the  latter were sent to Professor J. C. Kapteyn, of Holland, who undertook  the enormous labor of collecting them into a catalogue, the last volume  of which was published in 1899. One curious result of this enterprise  is that the work of listing the stars is more complete for the southern  hemisphere than for the northern.    Another great photographic work now in progress has to do with the  millions of stars which it is impossible to handle individually.  Fifteen years ago an association of observatories in both hemispheres  undertook to make a photographic chart of the sky on the largest scale.  Some portions of this work are now approaching completion, but in  others it is still in a backward state, owing to the failure of several  South American observatories to carry out their part of the programme.  When it is all done we shall have a picture of the sky, the study of  which may require the labor of a whole generation of astronomers.    Quite independently of this work, the Harvard University, under the  direction of Professor Pickering, keeps up the work of photographing  the sky on a surprising scale. On this plan we do not have to leave it  to posterity to learn whether there is any change in the heavens, for  one result of the enterprise has been the discovery of thirteen of the  new stars which now and then blaze out in the heavens at points where  none were before known. Professor Pickering's work has been continually  enlarged and improved until about 150,000 photographic plates, showing  from time to time the places of countless millions of stars among their  fellows are now stored at the Harvard Observatory. Not less remarkable  than this wealth of material has been the development of skill in  working it up. Some idea of the work will be obtained by reflecting  that, thirty years ago, careful study of the heavens by astronomers  devoting their lives to the task had resulted in the discovery of some  two or three hundred stars, varying in their light. Now, at Harvard,  through keen eyes studying and comparing successive photographs not  only of isolated stars, but of clusters and agglomerations of stars in  the Milky Way and elsewhere, discoveries of such objects numbering  hundreds have been made, and the work is going on with ever-increasing  speed. Indeed, the number of variable stars now known is such that  their study as individual objects no longer suffices, and they must  hereafter be treated statistically with reference to their distribution  in space, and their relations to one another, as a census classifies  the entire population without taking any account of individuals.    The works just mentioned are concerned with the stars. But the heavenly  spaces contain nebulae as well as stars; and photography can now be  even more successful in picturing them than the stars. A few years ago  the late lamented Keeler, at the Lick Observatory, undertook to see  what could be done by pointing the Crossley reflecting telescope at the  sky and putting a sensitive photographic plate in the focus. He was  surprised to find that a great number of nebulae, the existence of  which had never before been suspected, were impressed on the plate. Up  to the present time the positions of about 8000 of these objects have  been listed. Keeler found that there were probably 200,000 nebulae in  the heavens capable of being photographed with the Crossley reflector.  But the work of taking these photographs is so great, and the number of  reflecting telescopes which can be applied to it so small, that no one  has ventured to seriously commence it. It is worthy of remark that only  a very small fraction of these objects which can be photographed are  visible to the eye, even with the most powerful telescope.    This demonstration of what the reflecting telescope can do may be  regarded as one of the most important discoveries of our time as to the  capabilities of astronomical instruments. It has long been known that  the image formed in the focus of the best refracting telescope is  affected by an imperfection arising from the different action of the  glasses on rays of light of different colors. Hence, the image of a  star can never be seen or photographed with such an instrument, as an  actual point, but only as a small, diffused mass. This difficulty is  avoided in the reflecting telescope; but a new difficulty is found in  the bending of the mirror under the influence of its own weight.  Devices for overcoming this had been so far from successful that, when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#19)"],[1,"solitary fowl, which had edged  nervously away. Lord Dreever bent toward Jimmy.    \"Frightfully sorry, Pitt, old man,\" he whispered, feverishly.  \"Didn't want to come. Couldn't help it. He sent me out.\" He  half-looked over his shoulder. \"And,\" he added rapidly, as Molly came  back, \"the old boy's up at his bedroom window now, watching us  through his opera-glasses!\"    The return journey to the house was performed in silence--on Jimmy's  part, in thoughtful silence. He thought hard, and he had been  thinking ever since.    He had material for thought. That Lord Dreever was as clay in his  uncle's hands he was aware. He had not known his lordship long, but  he had known him long enough to realize that a backbone had been  carelessly omitted from his composition. What his uncle directed,  that would he do. The situation looked bad to Jimmy. The order, he  knew, had gone out that Lord Dreever was to marry money. And Molly  was an heiress. He did not know how much Mr. McEachern had amassed  in his dealings with New York crime, but it must be something  considerable. Things looked black.    Then, Jimmy had a reaction. He was taking much for granted. Lord  Dreever might be hounded into proposing to Molly, but what earthly  reason was there for supposing that Molly would accept him? He  declined even for an instant to look upon Spennie's title in the  light of a lure. Molly was not the girl to marry for a title. He  endeavored to examine impartially his lordship's other claims. He  was a pleasant fellow, with--to judge on short acquaintanceship--an  undeniably amiable disposition. That much must be conceded. But  against this must be placed the equally undeniable fact that he was  also, as he would have put it himself, a most frightful ass. He was  weak. He had no character. Altogether, the examination made Jimmy  more cheerful. He could not see the light-haired one, even with Sir  Thomas Blunt shoving behind, as it were, accomplishing the knight's  ends. Shove he never so wisely, Sir Thomas could never make a Romeo  out of Spennie Dreever.    It was while sitting in the billiard-room one night after dinner,  watching his rival play a hundred up with the silent Hargate, that  Jimmy came definitely to this conclusion. He had stopped there to  watch, more because he wished to study his man at close range than  because the game was anything out of the common as an exposition of  billiards. As a matter of fact, it would have been hard to imagine a  worse game. Lord Dreever, who was conceding twenty, was poor, and  his opponent an obvious beginner. Again, as he looked on, Jimmy was  possessed of an idea that he had met Hargate before. But, once more,  he searched his memory, and drew blank. He did not give the thing  much thought, being intent on his diagnosis of Lord Dreever, who by  a fluky series of cannons had wobbled into the forties, and was now  a few points ahead of his opponent.    Presently, having summed his lordship up to his satisfaction and  grown bored with the game, Jimmy strolled out of the room. He paused  outside the door for a moment, wondering what to do. There was  bridge in the smoking-room, but he did not feel inclined for bridge.  From the drawing-room came sounds of music. He turned in that  direction, then stopped again. He came to the conclusion that he did  not feel sociable. He wanted to think. A cigar on the terrace would  meet his needs.    He went up to his room for his cigar-case. The window was open. He  leaned out. There was almost a full moon, and it was very light out  of doors. His eye was caught by a movement at the further end of the  terrace, where the shadow was. A girl came out of the shadow,  walking slowly.    Not since early boyhood had Jimmy descended stairs with such a rare  burst of speed. He negotiated the nasty turn at the end of the first  flight at quite a suicidal pace. Fate, however, had apparently  wakened again and resumed business, for he did not break his neck. A  few moments later, he was out on the terrace, bearing a cloak which,  he had snatched up en route in the hall.    \"I thought you might be cold,\" he said, breathing quickly.    \"Oh, thank you,\" said Molly. \"How kind of you!\" He put it round her  shoulders. \"Have you been running?\"    \"I came downstairs rather fast.\"    \"Were you afraid the boogaboos would get you?\" she laughed. \"I was  thinking of when I was a small child. I was always afraid of them. I  used to race downstairs when I had to go to my room in the dark,  unless I could persuade someone to hold my hand all the way there  and back.\"    Her spirits had risen with Jimmy's arrival. Things had been  happening that worried her. She had gone out on to the terrace to be  alone. When she heard his footsteps, she had dreaded the advent of  some garrulous fellow-guest, full of small talk. Jimmy, somehow, was  a comfort. He did not disturb the atmosphere. Little as they had  seen of each other, something in him--she could not say what--had  drawn her to him. He was a man whom she could trust instinctively.    They walked on in silence. Words were pouring into Jimmy's mind, but  he could not frame them. He seemed to have lost the power of  coherent thought.    Molly said nothing. It was not a night for conversation. The moon  had turned terrace and garden into a fairyland of black and silver.  It was a night to look and listen and think.    They walked slowly up and down. As they turned for the second time,  Molly's thoughts formed themselves into a question. Twice she was on  the point of asking it, but each time she checked herself. It was an  impossible question. She had no right to put it, and he had no right  to answer. Yet, something was driving her on to ask it.    It came out suddenly, without warning.    \"Mr. Pitt, what do you think of Lord Dreever?\"    Jimmy started. No question could have chimed in more aptly with his  thoughts. Even as she spoke, he was struggling to keep himself from  asking her the same thing.    \"Oh, I know I ought not to ask,\" she went on. \"He's your host, and  you're his friend. I know. But--\"    Her voice trailed off. The muscles of Jimmy's back tightened and  quivered. But he could find no words.    \"I wouldn't ask anyone else. But you're--different, somehow. I don't  know what I mean. We hardly know each other. But--\"    She stopped again; and still he was dumb.    \"I feel so alone,\" she said very quietly, almost to herself.  Something seemed to break in Jimmy's head. His brain suddenly  cleared. He took a step forward.    A huge shadow blackened the white grass. Jimmy wheeled round. It was  McEachern.    \"I have been looking for you, Molly, my dear,\" he said, heavily. \"I  thought you must have gone to bed.\"    He turned to Jimmy, and addressed him for the first time since their  meeting in the bedroom.    \"Will you excuse us, Mr. Pitt?\"    Jimmy bowed, and walked rapidly toward the house. At the door, he  stopped and looked back. The two were standing where he had left  them.          CHAPTER XVI    A MARRIAGE ARRANGED      Neither Molly nor her father had moved or spoken while Jimmy was  covering the short strip of turf that ended at the stone steps of  the house. McEachern stood looking down at her in grim silence. His  great body against the dark mass of the castle wall seemed larger  than ever in the uncertain light. To Molly, there was something  sinister and menacing in his attitude. She found herself longing  that Jimmy would come back. She was frightened. Why, she could not  have said. It was as if some instinct told her that a crisis in her  affairs had been reached, and that she needed him. For the first  time in her life, she felt nervous in her father's company. Ever  since she was a child, she had been accustomed to look upon him as  her protector; but, now, she was afraid.    \"Father!\" she cried.    \"What are you doing out here?\"    His voice was tense and strained.    \"I came out because I wanted to think, father, dear.\"    She thought she knew his moods, but this was one that she had never  seen. It frightened her.    \"Why did he come out here?\"    \"Mr. Pitt? He brought me a wrap.\"    \"What was he saying to you?\"    The rain of questions gave Molly a sensation of being battered. She  felt dazed, and a little mutinous. What had she done that she should  be assailed like this?    \"He was saying nothing,\" she said, rather shortly.    \"Nothing? What do you mean? What was he saying? Tell me!\"    Molly's voice shook as she replied.    \"He was saying nothing,\" she repeated. \"Do you think I'm not telling  the truth, father? He had not spoken a word for ever so long. We  just walked up and down. I was thinking, and I suppose he was, too.  At any rate, he said nothing. I--I think you might believe me.\"    She began to cry quietly. Her father had never been like this  before. It hurt her.    McEachern's manner changed in a flash. In the shock of finding Jimmy  and Molly together on the terrace, he had forgotten himself. He had  had reason, to be suspicious. Sir Thomas Blunt, from whom he had  just parted, had told him a certain piece of news which had  disturbed him. The discovery of Jimmy with Molly had lent an added  significance to that piece of news. He saw that he had been rough.  In a moment, he was by her side, his great arm round her shoulder,  petting and comforting her as he had done when she was a child. He  believed her word without question; and his relief made him very  tender. Gradually, the sobs ceased. She leaned against his arm.    \"I'm tired, father,\" she whispered.    \"Poor little girl. We'll sit down.\"    There was a seat at the end of the terrace. McEachern picked Molly  up as if she had been a baby, and carried her to it. She gave a  little cry.    \"I didn't mean I was too tired to walk,\" she said, laughing  tremulously. \"How strong you are, father! If I was naughty, you  could take me up and shake me till I was good, couldn't you?\"    \"Of course. And send you to bed, too. So, you, "]]]
