And we left this for him among posterity,    \"PEACE BE ON ELIASIN!\"15    Thus do we reward the well-doers,    For he was one of our believing servants.    And Lot truly was of our Sent Ones,    When we rescued him and all his family,    Save an aged woman among those who tarried.    Afterward we destroyed the others.    And ye indeed pass by their ruined dwellings at morn    And night: will ye not then reflect?    Jonas, too, was one of the Apostles,    When he fled unto the laden ship,    And lots were cast,16 and he was doomed,    And the fish swallowed him, for he was blameworthy.    But had he not been of those who praise Us,    In its belly had he surely remained, till the day of resurrection.    And we cast him on the bare shore-and he was sick;-    And we caused a gourd-plant to grow up over him,    And we sent him to a hundred thousand persons, or even more,    And because they believed, we continued their enjoyments for a season.    Inquire then of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they, sons?    Have we created the angels females? and did they witness it?    Is it not a falsehood of their own devising, when they say,    \"God hath begotten\"? They are indeed liars.    Would he have preferred daughters to sons?    What reason have ye for thus judging?    Will ye not then receive this warning?    Have ye a clear proof for them?    Produce your Book if ye speak truth.    And they make him to be of kin with the Djinn: but the Djinn have long known  that these idolaters shall be brought up before God.    Far be the glory of God from what they impute to him.    \"His faithful servants do not thus.    Moreover, ye and what ye worship    Shall not stir up any against God,17    Save him who shall burn in Hell.    And verily each one of us hath his appointed place,    And we range ourselves in order,    And we celebrate His praises.\"18    And if those infidels say,    \"Had we a revelation transmitted to us from those of old,19    We had surely been God's faithful servants.\"    Yet they believe not the Koran. But they shall know its truth at last.    Our word came of old to our servants the apostles,    That they should surely be the succoured,    And that our armies should procure the victory for them.    Turn aside therefore from them for a time,    And behold them, for they too shall in the end behold their doom.    Would they then hasten our vengeance?    But when it shall come down into their courts, an evil morning shall it be to  those who have had their warning.    Turn aside from them therefore for a time.    And behold; for they too shall in the end behold their doom.    Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they  impute to him,    And peace be on his Apostles!    And praise be to God the Lord of the worlds.      _______________________    1 I have given in the text the sense of these first two verses according to  the Muhammadan commentators.

So oft as I cry to them, that thou mayest forgive them, they thrust their  fingers into their ears, and wrap themselves in their garments, and persist  in their error, and are disdainfully disdainful.    Then I cried aloud to them:    Then again spake I with plainness, and in private did I secretly address  them:    And I said, Beg forgiveness of your Lord, for He is ready to forgive.    He will send down the very Heaven upon you in plenteous rains;    And will increase you in wealth and children; and will give you gardens, and  will give you watercourses:-    What hath come to you that ye hope not for goodness from the hand of God?    For He it is who hath formed you by successive steps.1    See ye not how God hath created the seven heavens one over the other?    And He hath placed therein the moon as a light, and hath placed there the sun  as a torch;    And God hath caused you to spring forth from the earth like a plant;    Hereafter will He turn you back into it again, and will bring you forth anew-    And God hath spread the earth for you like a carpet,    That ye may walk therein along spacious paths.\"'    Said Noah, \"O my Lord! they rebel against me, and they follow those whose  riches and children do but aggravate their ruin.\"    And they plotted a great plot;    And they said, \"Forsake not your Gods; forsake not Wadd nor Sowah,    Nor Yaghuth and Yahuk and Nesr;\"    And they caused many to err;2-and thou, too, O Muhammad! shalt be the means  of increasing only error in the wicked-    Because of their sins they were drowned, and made to go into the Fire;    And they found that they had no helper save God.    And Noah said, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels on the Earth:    For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only  sinners, infidels.

This shall be your recompense. Your efforts shall meet with thanks.    We ourselves have sent down to thee the Koran as a missive from on high.    Await then with patience the judgments of thy Lord, and obey not the wicked  among them and the unbelieving:    And make mention of the name of thy Lord at morn, at even,    And at night. Adore him, and praise him the livelong night.    But these men love the fleeting present, and leave behind them the heavy day  of doom.

But I looked for him  without success, till, at the end of a fortnight, I made a pilgrimage to  Mount Vernon. Here, after visiting the grave, and going over the house,  as every visitor does, I sauntered about the grounds, thinking of the  great man who used to do the same so many years before, but all the  while keeping my eyes open for the present feathered inhabitants of the  sacred spot. Soon a bird dashed by me, and struck against the trunk of  an adjacent tree, and glancing up quickly, I beheld my much-sought  red-headed woodpecker. How appropriately patriotic he looked, at the  home of Washington, wearing the national colors,--red, white, and blue!  After this he became abundant about the capital, so that I saw him  often, and took much pleasure in his frolicsome ways; and, some years  later, he suddenly appeared in force in the vicinity of Boston, where he  remained through the winter months. To my thought, none the less, he  will always suggest Mount Vernon. Indeed, although he is certainly  rather jovial, and even giddy, he is to me the bird of Washington much  more truly than is the solemn, stupid-seeming eagle, who commonly bears  that name.    To go away from home, even if the journey be no longer than from  Massachusetts to the District of Columbia, is sure to prove an event of  no small interest to a young naturalist; and this visit of mine to the  national capital was no exception. On the afternoon of my arrival,  walking up Seventh Street, I heard a series of loud, clear, monotonous  whistles, which I had then no leisure to investigate, but the author of  which I promised myself the satisfaction of meeting at another time. In  fact, I think it was at least a fortnight before I learned that these  whistles came from the tufted titmouse. I had been seeing him almost  daily, but till then he had never chanced to use that particular note  while under my eye.    There was a certain tract of country, woodland and pasture, over which I  roamed a good many times, and which is still clearly mapped out in my  memory. Here I found my first Carolina or mocking wren, who ran in at  one side of a woodpile and came out at the other as I drew near, and  who, a day or two afterwards, sang so loudly from an oak tree that I  ransacked it with my eye in search of some large bird, and was  confounded when finally I discovered who the musician really was. Here,  every day, were to be heard the glorious song of the cardinal grosbeak,  the insect-like effort of the blue-gray gnatcatcher, and the rigmarole  of the yellow-breasted chat. On a wooded hillside, where grew a  profusion of trailing arbutus, pink azalea, and bird-foot violets, the  rowdyish, great-crested flycatchers were screaming in the tree-tops. In  this same grove I twice saw the rare red-bellied woodpecker, who, on  both occasions, after rapping smartly with his beak, turned his head and  laid his ear against the trunk, evidently listening to see whether his  alarm had set any grub a-stirring. Near by, in an undergrowth, I fell in  with a few worm-eating warblers. They seemed of a peculiarly  unsuspicious turn of mind, and certainly wore the quaintest of  head-dresses. I must mention also a scarlet tanager, who, all afire as  he was, one day alighted in a bush of flowering dogwood, which was  completely covered with its large white blossoms. Probably he had no  idea how well his perch became him.    Perhaps I ought to be ashamed to confess it, but, though I went several  times into the galleries of our honorable Senate and House of  Representatives, and heard speeches by some celebrated men, including at  least half a dozen candidates for the presidency, yet, after all, the  congressmen in feathers interested me most. I thought, indeed, that the  chat might well enough have been elected to the lower house. His  volubility and waggish manners would have made him quite at home in that  assembly, while his orange-colored waistcoat would have given him an  agreeable conspicuity. But, to be sure, he would have needed to learn  the use of tobacco.    Well, all this was only a few years ago; but the men whose eloquence  then drew the crowd to the capitol are, many of them, heard there no  longer. Some are dead; some have retired to private life. But the birds  never die. Every spring they come trooping back for their all-summer  session. The turkey-buzzard still floats majestically over the city; the  chat still practices his lofty tumbling in the suburban pastures,  snarling and scolding at all comers; the flowing Potomac still yields \"a  blameless sport\" to the fish-crow and the kingfisher; the orchard oriole  continues to whistle in front of the Agricultural Department, and the  crow blackbird to parade back and forth over the Smithsonian lawns.  Presidents and senators may come and go, be praised and vilified, and  then in turn forgotten; but the birds are subject to no such mutations.  It is a foolish thought, but sometimes their happy carelessness seems  the better part.                                      MINOR SONGSTERS.        The lesser lights, the dearer still      That they elude a vulgar eye.                                  BROWNING.                             Listen too,      How every pause is filled with under-notes.                                           SHELLEY.                                  MINOR SONGSTERS.      Among those of us who are in the habit of attending to bird-songs, there  can hardly be anybody, I think, who has not found himself specially and  permanently attracted by the music of certain birds who have little or  no general reputation. Our favoritism may perhaps be the result of early  associations: we heard the singer first in some uncommonly romantic  spot, or when we were in a mood of unusual sensibility; and, in greater  or less degree, the charm of that hour is always renewed for us with the  repetition of the song. Or if may be (who will assert the contrary?)  that there is some occult relation between the bird's mind and our own.  Or, once more, something may be due to the natural pleasure which  amiable people take (and all lovers of birds may be supposed, _a  priori_, to belong to that class) in paying peculiar honor to merit  which the world at large, less discriminating than they, has thus far  failed to recognize, and in which, therefore, as by \"right of  discovery,\" they have a sort of proprietary interest. This, at least, is  evident: our preference is not determined altogether by the intrinsic  worth of the song; the mind is active, not passive, and gives to the  music something from itself,--\"the consecration and the poet's dream.\"    Furthermore, it is to be said that a singer--and a bird no less than a  man--may be wanting in that fullness and scope of voice and that large  measure of technical skill which are absolutely essential to the great  artist, properly so called, and yet, within his own limitations, may be  competent to please even the most fastidious ear. It is with birds as  with other poets: the smaller gift need not be the less genuine; and  they whom the world calls greatest, and whom we ourselves most admire,  may possibly not be the ones who touch us most intimately, or to whom we  return oftenest and with most delight.    This may be well illustrated by a comparison of the chickadee with the  brown thrush. The thrush, or, as he is sometimes profanely styled, the  thrasher, is the most pretentious, perhaps I ought to say the greatest,  of New England songsters, if we rule out the mocking-bird, who is so  very rare with us as scarcely to come into the competition; and still,  in my opinion, his singing seldom produces the effect of really fine  music. With all his ability, which is nothing short of marvelous, his  taste is so deplorably uncertain, and his passion so often becomes a  downright frenzy, that the excited listener, hardly knowing what to  think, laughs and shouts. Bravo! by turns. Something must be amiss,  certainly, when the deepest feelings of the heart are poured forth in a  manner to suggest the performance of a _buffo_. The chickadee, on the  other hand, seldom gets mention as a singer. Probably he never looked  upon himself as such. You will not find him posing at the top of a tree,  challenging the world to listen and admire. But, as he hops from twig to  twig in quest of insects' eggs and other dainties, his merry spirits are  all the time bubbling over in little chirps and twitters, with now and  then a _Chickadee, dee_, or a _Hear, hear me_, every least syllable of  which is like \"the very sound of happy thoughts.\" For my part, I rate  such trifles with the best of all good music, and feel that we cannot be  grateful enough to the brave tit, who furnishes us with them for the  twelve months of every year.    So far as the chickadee is concerned, I see nothing whatever to wish  different; but am glad to believe that, for my day and long after, he  will remain the same unassuming, careless-hearted creature that he now  is. If I may be allowed the paradox, it would be too bad for him to  change, even for the better. But the bluebird, who like the titmouse is  hardly to be accounted a musician, does seem to be somewhat blameworthy.  Once in a while, it is true, he takes a perch and sings; but for the  most part he is contented with a few simple notes, having no semblance  of a tune. Possibly he holds that his pure contralto voice (I do not  remember ever to have heard from him any note of a soprano, or even of a  mezzo-soprano quality) ought by itself to be a sufficient distinction;  but I think it likelier that his slight attempt at music is only one  manifestation of the habitual reserve which, more than anything else  perhaps, may be said to characterize him. How differently he and the  robin impress us in this particular! Both take up their abode in our  door-yar"]]]
