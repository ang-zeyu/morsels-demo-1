[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28497"],[0,"Myths of the Norsemen: From the Eddas and Sagas (#19)"],[1,"         Odin's Rune-Song (Thorpe's tr.).      Odin made good use of this permission and drank so deeply that he  completely drained all three vessels. Then, having obtained all that  he wanted, he emerged from the cave and, donning his eagle plumes,  rose high into the blue, and, after hovering for a moment over the  mountain top, winged his flight towards Asgard.    He was still far from the gods' realm when he became aware of a  pursuer, and, indeed, Suttung, having also assumed the form of an  eagle, was coming rapidly after him with intent to compel him to  surrender the stolen mead. Odin therefore flew faster and faster,  straining every nerve to reach Asgard before the foe should overtake  him, and as he drew near the gods anxiously watched the race.    Seeing that Odin would only with difficulty be able to escape, the  AEsir hastily gathered all the combustible materials they could find,  and as he flew over the ramparts of their dwelling, they set fire to  the mass of fuel, so that the flames, rising high, singed the wings  of Suttung, as he followed the god, and he fell into the very midst  of the fire, where he was burned to death.    As for Odin, he flew to where the gods had prepared vessels for  the stolen mead, and disgorged the draught of inspiration in such  breathless haste that a few drops fell and were scattered over the  earth. There they became the portion of rhymesters and poetasters,  the gods reserving the main draught for their own consumption, and  only occasionally vouchsafing a taste to some favoured mortal, who,  immediately after, would win world-wide renown by his inspired songs.          \"Of a well-assumed form      I made good use:      Few things fail the wise;      For Od-hroerir      Is now come up      To men's earthly dwellings.\"                Havamal (Thorpe's tr.).      As men and gods owed the priceless gift to Odin, they were ever ready  to express to him their gratitude, and they not only called it by  his name, but they worshipped him as patron of eloquence, poetry,  and song, and of all scalds.        The God of Music    Although Odin had thus won the gift of poetry, he seldom made use of  it himself. It was reserved for his son Bragi, the child of Gunlod,  to become the god of poetry and music, and to charm the world with  his songs.          \"White-bearded bard, ag'd      Bragi, his gold harp      Sweeps--and yet softer      Stealeth the day.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).      As soon as Bragi was born in the stalactite-hung cave where Odin had  won Gunlod's affections, the dwarfs presented him with a magical golden  harp, and, setting him on one of their own vessels, they sent him out  into the wide world. As the boat gently passed out of subterranean  darkness, and floated over the threshold of Nain, the realm of the  dwarf of death, Bragi, the fair and immaculate young god, who until  then had shown no signs of life, suddenly sat up, and, seizing the  golden harp beside him, he began to sing the wondrous song of life,  which rose at times to heaven, and then sank down to the dread realm  of Hel, goddess of death.          \"Yggdrasil's ash is      Of all trees most excellent,      And of all ships, Skidbladnir;      Of the AEsir, Odin,      And of horses, Sleipnir;      Bifroest of bridges,      And of scalds, Bragi.\"                Lay of Grimnir (Thorpe's tr.).      While he played the vessel was wafted gently over sunlit waters, and  soon touched the shore. Bragi then proceeded on foot, threading his  way through the bare and silent forest, playing as he walked. At the  sound of his tender music the trees began to bud and bloom, and the  grass underfoot was gemmed with countless flowers.    Here he met Idun, daughter of Ivald, the fair goddess of immortal  youth, whom the dwarfs allowed to visit the earth from time to time,  when, at her approach, nature invariably assumed its loveliest and  gentlest aspect.    It was only to be expected that two such beings should feel  attracted to each other, and Bragi soon won this fair goddess for his  wife. Together they hastened to Asgard, where both were warmly welcomed  and where Odin, after tracing runes on Bragi's tongue, decreed that  he should be the heavenly minstrel and composer of songs in honour  of the gods and of the heroes whom he received in Valhalla.        Worship of Bragi    As Bragi was god of poetry, eloquence, and song, the Northern  races also called poetry by his name, and scalds of either sex were  frequently designated as Braga-men or Braga-women. Bragi was greatly  honoured by all the Northern races, and hence his health was always  drunk on solemn or festive occasions, but especially at funeral feasts  and at Yuletide celebrations.    When it was time to drink this toast, which was served in cups shaped  like a ship, and was called the Bragaful, the sacred sign of the hammer  was first made over it. Then the new ruler or head of the family  solemnly pledged himself to some great deed of valour, which he was  bound to execute within the year, unless he wished to be considered  destitute of honour. Following his example, all the guests were then  wont to make similar vows and declare what they would do; and as some  of them, owing to previous potations, talked rather too freely of  their intentions on these occasions, this custom seems to connect the  god's name with the vulgar but very expressive English verb \"to brag.\"    In art, Bragi is generally represented as an elderly man, with long  white hair and beard, and holding the golden harp from which his  fingers could draw such magic strains.              CHAPTER VII: IDUN      The Apples of Youth    Idun, the personification of spring or immortal youth, who, according  to some mythologists, had no birth and was never to taste death,  was warmly welcomed by the gods when she made her appearance in  Asgard with Bragi. To further win their affections she promised them  a daily taste of the marvellous apples which she bore in her casket,  and which had the power of conferring immortal youth and loveliness  upon all who partook of them.          \"The golden apples      Out of her garden      Have yielded you a dower of youth,      Ate you them every day.\"                Wagner (Forman's tr.).      Thanks to this magic fruit, the Scandinavian gods, who, because  they sprang from a mixed race, were not all immortal, warded off the  approach of old age and disease, and remained vigorous, beautiful, and  young through countless ages. These apples were therefore considered  very precious indeed, and Idun carefully treasured them in her magic  casket. No matter how many she drew out, the same number always  remained for distribution at the feast of the gods, to whom alone she  vouchsafed a taste, although dwarfs and giants were eager to obtain  possession of the fruit.          \"Bright Iduna, Maid immortal!      Standing at Valhalla's portal,      In her casket has rich store      Of rare apples gilded o'er;      Those rare apples, not of Earth,      Ageing AEsir give fresh birth.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).        The Story of Thiassi    One day, Odin, Hoenir, and Loki started out upon one of their usual  excursions to earth, and, after wandering for a long while, they  found themselves in a deserted region, where they could discover no  hospitable dwelling. Weary and very hungry, the gods, perceiving a  herd of oxen, slew one of the beasts, and, kindling a fire, they sat  down beside it to rest while waiting for their meat to cook.    To their surprise, however, in spite of the roaring flames the carcass  remained quite raw. Realising that some magic must be at work, they  looked about them to discover what could hinder their cookery, when  they perceived an eagle perched upon a tree above them. Seeing that he  was an object of suspicion to the wayfarers, the bird addressed them  and admitted that he it was who had prevented the fire from doing its  accustomed work, but he offered to remove the spell if they would give  him as much food as he could eat. The gods agreed to do this, whereupon  the eagle, swooping downward, fanned the flames with his huge wings,  and soon the meat was cooked. The eagle then made ready to carry off  three quarters of the ox as his share, but this was too much for Loki,  who seized a great stake lying near at hand, and began to belabour  the voracious bird, forgetting that it was skilled in magic arts. To  his great dismay one end of the stake stuck fast to the eagle's back,  the other to his hands, and he found himself dragged over stones and  through briers, sometimes through the air, his arms almost torn out  of their sockets. In vain he cried for mercy and implored the eagle  to let him go; the bird flew on, until he promised any ransom his  captor might ask in exchange for his release.    The seeming eagle, who was the storm giant Thiassi, at last agreed  to release Loki upon one condition. He made him promise upon the  most solemn of oaths that he would lure Idun out of Asgard, so that  Thiassi might obtain possession of her and of her magic fruit.    Released at last, Loki returned to Odin and Hoenir, to whom, however,  he was very careful not to confide the condition upon which he had  obtained his freedom; and when they had returned to Asgard he began  to plan how he might entice Idun outside of the gods' abode. A few  days later, Bragi being absent on one of his minstrel journeys, Loki  sought Idun in the groves of Brunnaker, where she had taken up her  abode, and by artfully describing some apples which grew at a short  distance, and which he mendaciously declared were exactly like hers,  he lured her away from Asgard with a crystal dish full of fruit,  which she intended to compare with that which he extolled. No sooner  had Idun left Asgard, however, than the deceiver Loki forsook her,  and ere she could return to the shelter of the heavenly abode the  storm giant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#19)"],[1,"he had his name engraved upon that gate which he  had himself erected in the temple.    9. Herod was also a lover of his father, if any other person ever was  so; for he made a monument for his father, even that city which he built  in the finest plain that was in his kingdom, and which had rivers and  trees in abundance, and named it Antipatris. He also built a wall about  a citadel that lay above Jericho, and was a very strong and very  fine building, and dedicated it to his mother, and called it Cypros.  Moreover, he dedicated a tower that was at Jerusalem, and called it  by the name of his brother Phasaelus, whose structure, largeness, and  magnificence we shall describe hereafter. He also built another city in  the valley that leads northward from Jericho, and named it Phasaelis.    10. And as he transmitted to eternity his family and friends, so did he  not neglect a memorial for himself, but built a fortress upon a mountain  towards Arabia, and named it from himself, Herodium 35 and he called  that hill that was of the shape of a woman's breast, and was sixty  furlongs distant from Jerusalem, by the same name. He also bestowed much  curious art upon it, with great ambition, and built round towers all  about the top of it, and filled up the remaining space with the most  costly palaces round about, insomuch that not only the sight of the  inner apartments was splendid, but great wealth was laid out on the  outward walls, and partitions, and roofs also. Besides this, he brought  a mighty quantity of water from a great distance, and at vast charges,  and raised an ascent to it of two hundred steps of the whitest marble,  for the hill was itself moderately high, and entirely factitious. He  also built other palaces about the roots of the hill, sufficient to  receive the furniture that was put into them, with his friends also,  insomuch that, on account of its containing all necessaries, the  fortress might seem to be a city, but, by the bounds it had, a palace  only.    11. And when he had built so much, he showed the greatness of his soul  to no small number of foreign cities. He built palaces for exercise at  Tripoli, and Damascus, and Ptolemais; he built a wall about Byblus,  as also large rooms, and cloisters, and temples, and market-places at  Berytus and Tyre, with theatres at Sidon and Damascus. He also built  aqueducts for those Laodiceans who lived by the sea-side; and for those  of Ascalon he built baths and costly fountains, as also cloisters round  a court, that were admirable both for their workmanship and largeness.  Moreover, he dedicated groves and meadows to some people; nay, not a few  cities there were who had lands of his donation, as if they were parts  of his own kingdom. He also bestowed annual revenues, and those for ever  also, on the settlements for exercises, and appointed for them, as well  as for the people of Cos, that such rewards should never be wanting. He  also gave corn to all such as wanted it, and conferred upon Rhodes large  sums of money for building ships; and this he did in many places,  and frequently also. And when Apollo's temple had been burnt down, he  rebuilt it at his own charges, after a better manner than it was before.  What need I speak of the presents he made to the Lycians and Samnians?  or of his great liberality through all Ionia? and that according  to every body's wants of them. And are not the Athenians, and  Lacedemonians, and Nicopolitans, and that Pergamus which is in Mysia,  full of donations that Herod presented them withal? And as for that  large open place belonging to Antioch in Syria, did not he pave it with  polished marble, though it were twenty furlongs long? and this when  it was shunned by all men before, because it was full of dirt and  filthiness, when he besides adorned the same place with a cloister of  the same length.    12. It is true, a man may say, these were favors peculiar to those  particular places on which he bestowed his benefits; but then what  favors he bestowed on the Eleans was a donation not only in common to  all Greece, but to all the habitable earth, as far as the glory of the  Olympic games reached. For when he perceived that they were come to  nothing, for want of money, and that the only remains of ancient Greece  were in a manner gone, he not only became one of the combatants in that  return of the fifth-year games, which in his sailing to Rome he happened  to be present at, but he settled upon them revenues of money for  perpetuity, insomuch that his memorial as a combatant there can never  fail. It would be an infinite task if I should go over his payments  of people's debts, or tributes, for them, as he eased the people of  Phasaelis, of Batanea, and of the small cities about Cilicia, of those  annual pensions they before paid. However, the fear he was in much  disturbed the greatness of his soul, lest he should be exposed to envy,  or seem to hunt after greater filings than he ought, while he bestowed  more liberal gifts upon these cities than did their owners themselves.    13. Now Herod had a body suited to his soul, and was ever a most  excellent hunter, where he generally had good success, by the means of  his great skill in riding horses; for in one day he caught forty wild  beasts: 36 that country breeds also bears, and the greatest part of it  is replenished with stags and wild asses. He was also such a warrior as  could not be withstood: many men, therefore, there are who have stood  amazed at his readiness in his exercises, when they saw him throw the  javelin directly forward, and shoot the arrow upon the mark. And then,  besides these performances of his depending on his own strength of mind  and body, fortune was also very favorable to him; for he seldom failed  of success in his wars; and when he failed, he was not himself the  occasion of such failings, but he either was betrayed by some, or the  rashness of his own soldiers procured his defeat.              CHAPTER 22.           The Murder Of Aristobulus And Hyrcanus, The High Priests, As       Also Of Mariamne The Queen.    1. However, fortune was avenged on Herod in his external great  successes, by raising him up domestical troubles; and he began to have  wild disorders in his family, on account of his wife, of whom he was so  very fond. For when he came to the government, he sent away her whom  he had before married when he was a private person, and who was born at  Jerusalem, whose name was Doris, and married Mariamne, the daughter of  Alexander, the son of Aristobulus; on whose account disturbances arose  in his family, and that in part very soon, but chiefly after his return  from Rome. For, first of all, he expelled Antipater the son of Doris,  for the sake of his sons by Mariamne, out of the city, and permitted him  to come thither at no other times than at the festivals. After this  he slew his wife's grandfather, Hyrcanus, when he was returned out of  Parthin to him, under this pretense, that he suspected him of plotting  against him. Now this Hyrcanus had been carried captive to Barzapharnes,  when he overran Syria; but those of his own country beyond Euphrates  were desirous he would stay with them, and this out of the commiseration  they had for his condition; and had he complied with their desires,  when they exhorted him not to go over the river to Herod, he had not  perished: but the marriage of his granddaughter [to Herod] was his  temptation; for as he relied upon him, and was over-fond of his own  country, he came back to it. Herod's provocation was this,--not that  Hyrcanus made any attempt to gain the kingdom, but that it was fitter  for him to be their king than for Herod.    2. Now of the five children which Herod had by Mariamne, two of them  were daughters, and three were sons; and the youngest of these sons was  educated at Rome, and there died; but the two eldest he treated as those  of royal blood, on account of the nobility of their mother, and because  they were not born till he was king. But then what was stronger than all  this was the love that he bare to Mariamne, and which inflamed him every  day to a great degree, and so far conspired with the other motives, that  he felt no other troubles, on account of her he loved so entirely. But  Mariamne's hatred to him was not inferior to his love to her. She had  indeed but too just a cause of indignation from what he had done,  while her boldness proceeded from his affection to her; so she openly  reproached him with what he had done to her grandfather Hyrcanus, and to  her brother Aristobulus; for he had not spared this Aristobulus, though  he were but a child; for when he had given him the high priesthood at  the age of seventeen, he slew him quickly after he had conferred that  dignity upon him; but when Aristobulus had put on the holy vestments,  and had approached to the altar at a festival, the multitude, in great  crowds, fell into tears; whereupon the child was sent by night to  Jericho, and was there dipped by the Galls, at Herod's command, in a  pool till he was drowned.    3. For these reasons Mariamne reproached Herod, and his sister and  mother, after a most contumelious manner, while he was dumb on account  of his affection for her; yet had the women great indignation at her,  and raised a calumny against her, that she was false to his bed;  which thing they thought most likely to move Herod to anger. They also  contrived to have many other circumstances believed, in order to make  the thing more credible, and accused her of having sent her picture into  Egypt to Antony, and that her lust was so extravagant, as to have thus  showed herself, though she was absent, to a man that ran mad after  women, and to a man that had it in his power to use violence to her.  This charge fell like a thunderbolt upon Herod, and put him into  disorder; and that especially, because his love to her occasioned him to  be jealous, and because he considered with"]]]
