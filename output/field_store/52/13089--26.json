It also occurs in the lower Balsas  Valley, but it has not been found in the scrub forest of the broad  Tepalcatepec Valley. Perhaps the large number of _Sceloporus siniferus_  on the coastal lowlands is responsible for the small number there of _S.  pyrocephalus_, another terrestrial species of about the same size. The  latter is abundant in the Tepalcatepec Valley, where _S. siniferus  siniferus_ has not been found. _Sceloporus siniferus siniferus_ is a  fast runner and difficult to collect; consequently, the small number of  specimens available is not indicative of its abundance.      ~Sceloporus spinosus spinosus~ Wiegmann         _Sceloporus spinosus_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 21:370,       1828.--Mexico.

Although this species is widespread on the southern part of the Mexican  Plateau, it is uncommon in Michoacan. It has been collected only in  rather open situations in the mesquite-grassland on the plateau between  1500 and 2300 meters, where it has been found in association with  _Sceloporus dugesi intermedius_ and _S. scalaris scalaris_. Most  specimens of _Sceloporus spinosus spinosus_ have been observed on rock  fences. In this habitat the species is the larger member of a pair of  species, the smaller of which is _Sceloporus dugesi intermedius_.      ~Sceloporus torquatus torquatus~ Wiegmann         _Sceloporus torquatus_ Wiegmann, Isis von Oken, 21:369,       1828.--Mexico.

This large species inhabits the Mexican Plateau and the Cordillera  Volcanica, but not the Sierra de Coalcoman, where apparently it is  replaced by _Sceloporus bulleri_. _Sceloporus torquatus torquatus_  usually is found in pine or pine-fir forests at elevations between 1450  and 3000 meters. In many places it is almost entirely arboreal, but in  areas where there are many fallen trees or rock fences and rock piles,  many individuals have been found on the ground near the rocks or logs.  In the coniferous forests this species is associated with _S. grammicus  microtepidotus_ and _S. aeneus aeneus_.    The distinction made by Smith (1938:572) between the subspecies _S.  torquatus torquatus_ and _melanogaster_ is slight. Individuals with pale  bluish spots are found throughout the range of the species in Michoacan;  spotting is especially evident in the young. Individuals having an  incomplete nuchal collar have been found at Maravatio and at Zinapecuaro  in the northern part of the state; in this character these specimens  resemble _S. torquatus melanogaster_, which is found to the north from  Guanajuato to Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi.      ~Sceloporus utiformis~ Cope         _Sceloporus utiformis_ Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.       Philadelphia, 16:177, September 30, 1864.--Colima, Colima,       Mexico.         Nineteen km. S of Arteaga (2); Cascada Tzararacua (17);       Coahuayana (3); Coalcoman (6); El Sabino (2); El Ticuiz (2);       Ostula (3); Pomaro; Rio Cachan; San Juan de Lima; Uruapan       (26).    In Michoacan the range of this species is discontinuous. It has been  found between 1050 and 1550 meters on the slopes of the Cordillera  Volcanica, and on the coast and seaward slopes of the Sierra de  Coalcoman up to an elevation of 900 meters. It is absent from the  Tepalcatepec Valley. At Uruapan and at Cascada Tzararacua this lizard  was found on the ground in oak forest or in open pine-oak forest; on the  coast and foothills of the Sierra de Coalcoman it was found on the  ground in the gallery forests along streams, and not in the scrub  forest.      ~Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus~ (Schmidt)         _Uta tuberculata_ Schmidt, Amer. Mus. Novitates, 22:4,       December 1, 1921.--Colima, Colima, Mexico.         _Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus_, Mittleman, Bull. Mus.       Comp. Zool., 91:169, September, 1942.

Tupataro; Uruapan (12); Tzitzio; Zamora.    The known distribution and geographic variation of _Urosaurus  bicarinatus_ in southwestern Mexico presents a confused picture. In  general rugosity, specimens from the coastal region of Michoacan  (Coahuayana, La Orilla, La Placita, Playa Azul, and Pomaro) resemble _U.  bicarinatus tuberculatus_ to the north along the Pacific coast.  Furthermore, specimens from the coast have less stippling in the gular  region than do those from the Sierra de Coalcoman and the slopes of the  Cordillera Volcanica. Specimens from the mountains have greatly carinate  enlarged dorsals, large lateral tubercles, and heavily stippled throats;  in these characters they resemble specimens from Morelos, Guerrero, and  Oaxaca. As mentioned by Peters (1954:14), some specimens from La Orilla  and San Salvador are like _U. bicarinatus bicarinatus_ in certain  characters, and one specimen has the blue ventral patches restricted to  the sternal area, a characteristic of _U. bicarinatus anonymorphus_ of  Oaxaca and eastern Guerrero. Examination of all available specimens from  Michoacan indicates that the nature of the dorsal scales is of little  value in separating the subspecies. The specimens from Michoacan are  here provisionally referred to _U. bicarinatus tuberculatus_, because  cursory examination of specimens from several localities between Nayarit  and Oaxaca shows that there are only minor differences between the named  populations. Individuals from the northern part of the range are more  rugose and have larger blue ventral patches and less gular stippling  than those from the south.    In Michoacan _Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus_ is found in wooded  areas, not in open scrub forest, in the coastal area to elevations of  about 900 meters, and along the slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica and  the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau at elevations from 1000 to 1700  meters. The record for Tupataro probably is erroneous, for no other  specimens of this species are known from the central plateau.  Essentially, the distribution of this species parallels that of  _Sceloporus utiformis_, a strictly terrestrial species. _Urosaurus  bicarinatus tuberculatus_ lives on tree trunks. Below 1000 meters in the  Tepalcatepec Valley _Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus_ is replaced by  _Urosaurus gadowi_.      ~Urosaurus gadowi~ (Schmidt)         _Uta gadovi_ Schmidt, Amer. Mus. Novitates, 22:3, December       1, 1921.--Cofradia, Jalisco, Mexico (in error) = Cofradia,       Michoacan, Mexico (Duellman, 1958b:49).         _Urosaurus gadowi_, Mittleman, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool.,       91:154, September, 1942.         Acahuato (2); Apatzingan (56); 12-16 km.

SE of Nueva Italia (3); San Salvador (2); Santa Ana;       Tepalcatepec; Volcan Jorullo (3); Zicuiran (2);       Ziracuaretiro.    Although individuals of this species have been collected at elevations  slightly exceeding 1200 meters on Volcan Jorullo and at 1100 meters at  Ziracuaretiro on the southern slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica, for  the most part these lizards are found at elevations of less than 800  meters, where they inhabit the open arid scrub forest of the  Tepalcatepec Valley, a region to which this species is endemic  (Duellman, 1958b:49). These small lizards usually are found on the  trunks and main branches of the small trees in the scrub forest; in this  habitat they are associated with _Sceloporus horridus oligoporus_, a  much larger species.    Males have a pale orange spot on the throat and a pale blue belly;  females have immaculate venters.    A specimen from Guayabo on the northern slopes of the Sierra de  Coalcoman was referred to _Urosaurus irregularis_ (Fischer) by Peters  (1954:15). I have studied this specimen (BMNH 1914.1.28.110), a female  having a snout-vent length of 46 mm., and agree with Peters that it  closely resembles Fischer's description and figure (1882: pl. 17, fig.  1). This specimen and those seen of _Urosaurus gadowi_ all have  pavementlike enlarged dorsal scales that are complete across the  vertical line. In _U. gadowi_ the enlarged dorsals usually are in four  to six irregular rows; in the specimen from Guayabo the dorsals are in  two rows. Although none of the other specimens of _U. gadowi_ examined  has only two rows of enlarged dorsals, I prefer to consider the specimen  from Guayabo as an aberrant individual of that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],[0,"Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#19)"],[1,"the others have done.  I do not think that he himself is likely to leave the deck when the  captain is below, and the two of us who happen to be on duty can have  our meals when he does. Of course whenever those on duty come down for  this purpose the others will take their places until they return. We  will change about each day. This is supposed to be your watch, Allen,  from four to eight. Wilfrid and I will begin the work at that hour. You  will relieve us at twelve, and we shall take the watch from four to  eight. To-morrow we will take the early watch, and so on.\"    \"I will tell the Grimstones,\" Wilfrid, who had always gone for a daily  chat with the men forward, said; \"they will be glad to join us in the  watch, and I should think the other men forward would do so too. I know  they all find it very hard work to get through the day.\"    The Grimstones at once agreed to keep watch, as did the other three men  who occupied the fore cabin with them. Mr. Atherton got muskets and  ammunition for them from Mr. Ryan, and the two Grimstones were  appointed to his watch, the other men to that of the Allens.    At seven bells most of the passengers came on deck to enjoy the fresh  morning air for an hour before breakfast.    \"You are not going to enjoy the pleasure of Wilfrid's or my company at  breakfast, Mrs. Renshaw,\" Mr. Atherton said, smiling, to that lady as  she stood with the three girls round her on the poop.    \"Why not, Mr. Atherton?\" she asked in surprise.    \"He and the Allens and myself are going to do amateur sentry work as  long as we lie here, Mrs Renshaw. The crew will be all busy refitting  the ship, and so I have volunteered to undertake, with their assistance,  the duty of keeping a sharp eye on those tricky gentlemen ashore.\"    \"Are you in earnest, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"Quite in earnest that we are going to do so, Mrs. Renshaw. There may be  no absolute occasion for it, but there is nothing like keeping on the  safe side; and as we cannot go ashore, and one cannot talk continuously  for fifteen or sixteen hours, we may just as well pass a portion of our  time in playing at sentinels.\"    \"But when will you get breakfast?\" Marion asked. \"Shall I bring it up to  you, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"No, thank you, Miss Renshaw. We have arranged to have it with Mr. Ryan  afterwards. I am much obliged to you for your offer just the same. It is  a very kind one, especially since you will, for once, particularly enjoy  your breakfast, as you will have room for your elbows.\"    \"You are laughing at me again, Mr. Atherton. One would really think  that you take me to be about ten years old.\"    \"I think a little teasing does you good, Miss Renshaw. It is one of the  privileges of us old fellows to try to do good to our young friends; and  girls of your age lord it so over their brothers and their brothers'  friends, that it is good for them to be teased a little by their  elders.\"    \"Would not you think, mother,\" Marion appealed, \"that Mr. Atherton by  his talk was somewhere about eighty and that I was quite a child?\"    \"I agree with him that it is rather a good thing for girls of your age,  Marion, to be snubbed a little occasionally; especially on a voyage like  this, when there are several young fellows on board who have nothing  better to do than to wait upon you and humour your whims.\"    There was a general laugh. Before a fresh subject was started the  breakfast bell rang and the passengers went below. Mr. Atherton fetched  his rifle from his cabin, and Wilfrid was going to unpack his  double-barrelled gun when his friend said: \"I should not bother about  that now, Wilfrid; take one of the ship's muskets. It will make just as  much noise if you have to fire it, and you will not be alarming the  passengers by bringing your gun backwards and forwards from your cabin.  I am going to hang up my rifle when I come off guard in Ryan's cabin on  deck, where it will be handy. You take the fo'castle, your two men can  be in the waist, one on each side, and I will take the poop. Just at  present our duty will be a nominal one, as the canoes have not put out,  but I expect they will be here before long.\"    Before breakfast was over, indeed, a large canoe was brought down from  the woods and placed in the water, and a number of natives appeared on  the shore. The first officer at once summoned the captain on deck.    \"Tell all the men to have their arms handy, Mr. Ryan,\" the captain said  as he looked at the gathering on shore. \"I do not suppose they mean to  attack us in this open way, still we may as well be upon our guard.  Order the men not to show their arms, but to go about their work as  usual. We do not wish to appear afraid of them, or to take up a position  of hostility. I hope the chiefs are coming off for a friendly palaver.\"    In a few minutes the canoes put off from the shore. First came the great  canoe, which was paddled by thirty men. In the bow and stern were  hideous images. Four natives, evidently of superior rank, were seated  near the stern, and in the bow stood a man beating his hands in time to  the stroke of the paddles and singing a song, which was responded to by  a deep exclamation from the rowers at every stroke. Another man stood by  the side of the singer waving a green bough. Behind this great canoe  followed a score of smaller ones.    \"We will receive them in state, Mr. Ryan. Evidently they intend to keep  up an appearance of friendliness at present. We will meet them in the  same spirit. Fasten the signal flags on to the halyards and run them up  to the masthead, let half a dozen men with cutlasses take their place at  the gangway as a sort of guard of honour, let the rest go on with their  work but keep their arms handy for action.\"    When the great canoe approached the vessel the men stopped paddling,  and one of the chiefs standing up made an address to the captain, who  was standing at the top of the gangway. Not a word that he said was  understood, but the address seemed to be of a friendly nature, and the  chief held up some cocoa-nuts and yams as if to show his desire to  trade. When he had finished the captain took off his hat and also spoke,  and by gestures invited the chiefs to come on board. By this time all  the passengers had come on deck, and were watching the proceedings with  great interest.    \"Do you think it safe to let them on board?\" the first officer asked Mr.  Atherton, who was intently watching the natives in the smaller canoes.    \"Quite safe,\" he replied. \"So long as only a few of their followers come  with them there is no fear of their attempting anything. While the  chiefs are in our hands they act, as it were, as hostages for the good  conduct of their people. So far their intentions are clearly peaceful.  Whether that will last will depend upon whether they think there is a  chance of success or not. At present all we have to do is to take  advantage of it, and to get what we want on board.\"    By this time the canoe was approaching the side of the ship. The four  chiefs ascended the ladder, followed by four or five of lower rank who  had been seated near them. As they reached the deck the principal chief  turned round and shouted an order in a loud voice. Its effect was  immediate. The canoe in which they had arrived at once paddled away to a  short distance, while the smaller craft, which had before been drifting  slowly towards the vessel, also retired and lay huddled behind the large  canoe.          CHAPTER VII.    A SAVAGE SURPRISE.      The captain led the way on to the poop, the chiefs and the natives with  them following, while the first officer with the six sailors with sabres  kept in their rear. Once on the quarter-deck Mr. Ryan ranged three of  the men by the bulwark on either side, telling them to sheath their  cutlasses, but to be prepared for instant action in case of treachery.  The chiefs preserved a stolid demeanour, scarce glancing at the  passengers, who were gathered on the poop. At the captain's orders the  steward brought up a number of cushions and placed them on the deck in a  circle. The captain seated himself on one and motioned to the chiefs to  follow his example, which they did without hesitation. Mr. Ryan now  brought up a number of things as presents for the chiefs, and each was  presented with a hand mirror, a roll of scarlet cloth, and some  trinkets, as a small supply of these had been brought on board for trade  with the natives in case of the necessity arising.    The head chief was in addition presented with an axe, and rolls of  coloured cotton strings of glass beads and some brass rings were given  to the inferior chiefs. The natives appeared pleased with their  presents. The captain then addressed them, and endeavoured to explain  that he wanted a supply of water. An empty barrel was brought up and  some water poured into this, and the captain then pointed to the shore,  and by gestures intimated that he wished the barrels to be taken ashore  and filled. The chiefs evidently understood the explanation, and nodded  their assent. The captain then led them to the stump of the mainmast,  pointed to the shore, and taking an axe imitated the action of chopping,  and showed that he wanted them to fell a tree and bring it off to the  vessel. The chief pointed to the boats hanging on the davits, placed the  axe in the hands of one of the men, and clearly signified that the crew  could go ashore and cut down a tree if they chose. The captain shook his  head and placed the axe in the hands of one of the chiefs. Their leader,  however, went up to the foremast, and by spreading out his arms  signified that it was a great size, and then held out the small axe the  captain had presented to him with an action of disdain.    \"The beggar means that with one axe they would never cut down a tree of  that size,\" the first officer said.    \"That is all humbug, Ryan; they can bring down the biggest trees for the  construction of "]]]
