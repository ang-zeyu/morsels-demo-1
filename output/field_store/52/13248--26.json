I expect this; I look for nothing else. Without it, I could not be  happy. The thought or belief that I should be denied this privilege  hereafter would make me miserable from this moment. I never could be  happy again without the hope that I shall enjoy the society of my wives  and children in eternity. If I had not this hope, I should be of all  men most unhappy, for \"if in this life only we have hope in Christ,  we are of all men most miserable.\" And all who have tasted of the  influence of the Spirit of God, and have had awakened within them a  hope of eternal life, cannot be happy unless they continue to drink of  that fountain until they are satisfied, and it is the only fountain at  which they can drink and be satisfied.--_Journal of Discourses,_ Vol.  25, 1884, pp. 51-60.    TRUST IN GOD. The need of one's having a keen knowledge of the truth  is paramount. So also is it that every Latter-day Saint should have  a deep-rooted conviction of the justice of God, and an implicit  confidence and faith in his being and mercy. To rightfully understand  the gospel and to be able to keep his commandments such knowledge is  absolutely necessary. Let each person ask himself if in his soul there  is a sharp and immovable conviction of these facts. Could anything that  might occur to you, or that might take place in the Church, or with her  officers or authorities, change your faith in the purposes, and in the  {80} absolute justice and mercy, of the Lord, or in the saving power  of his gospel, the message of his salvation? If so, your faith is not  deep-rooted, and there is strong need of your becoming convinced. * * *    No person can realize the fulness of the blessings of God, unless he  can approach, in some degree, at least, the standard of faith in God's  justice, exemplified in the examples quoted. He must have founded in  his own soul belief and confidence in the justice and mercy of God. It  must be individual, no man can act for another. Lessons of this class  need be taught and held up before the youth of Zion, to bring forcibly  to their minds the truth which alone will make them free and able to  stand firm in the faith. Let them, as they are called together in their  assemblies, present themselves before God, and be reminded of his  gracious benefits, in bringing forth the Book of Mormon, in the scenes  of Kirtland, in Zion, in Nauvoo, in the trying days of the exodus, and  in the wilderness. This that they might count the mercies of God in  his promises, and behold how past affliction and sore trial have been  turned to the well-being of his people; and so renew their covenants,  filled with a deep-rooted, immovable conviction of the goodness and  mercy of the Lord. Each individual must learn this lesson, it must be  impressed upon his soul, so deep, and be so well-founded that nothing  can separate him from a knowledge of the love of God, though death and  hell stand in the way.    God is good; his promises never fail; to trust implicitly his goodness  and mercy is a correct principle. Let us, therefore, put our trust in  him.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 7, p. 53, Nov., 1904.    I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES. It is by the power of God that all  things are made that have been made. It is by the power of Christ that  all things are governed and kept in place that are governed and kept  in place in the universe. {81} It is the power which proceeds from  the presence of the Son of God throughout all the works of his hands,  that giveth light, energy, understanding, knowledge, and a degree  of intelligence to all the children of men, strictly in accordance  with the words in the Book of job: \"There is a spirit in man; and the  inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.\" It is this  inspiration from God, proceeding throughout all his creations, that  enlighteneth the children of men; and it is nothing more nor less than  the spirit of Christ that enlighteneth the mind, that quickeneth the  understanding, and that prompteth the children of men to do that which  is good and to eschew that which is evil; which quickens the conscience  of man and gives him intelligence to judge between good and evil, light  and darkness, right and wrong.    But the Holy Ghost, who bears record of the Father and the Son,  who takes of the things of the Father and shows them unto men, who  testifies of Jesus Christ, and of the everliving God, the Father of  Jesus Christ, and who bears witness of the truth--this Spirit, this  Intelligence, is not given unto all men until they repent of their  sins and come into a state of worthiness before the Lord. Then they  receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands of  those who are authorized of God to bestow his blessings upon the heads  of the children of men. The Spirit spoken of in that which I have read  is that Spirit which will not cease to strive with the children of  men until they are brought to the possession of the greater light and  intelligence. Though a man may commit all manner of sin and blasphemy,  if he has not received the testimony of the Holy Ghost, he may be  forgiven by repenting of his sins, humbling himself before the Lord,  and obeying in sincerity the commandments of God. As it is stated,  \"Every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on  my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments {82} shall  see my face and know that I am.\" He shall be forgiven, and receive of  the greater light; he will enter into a solemn covenant with God, into  a compact with the Almighty, through the Only Begotten Son, whereby  he becomes a son of God, an heir of God, and a joint heir with Jesus  Christ. Then if he shall sin against the light and knowledge he has  received, the light that was within him shall become darkness, and oh,  how great will be that darkness! Then, and not till then, will this  Spirit of Christ that lighteth every man that cometh into the world  cease to strive with him, and he shall be left to his own destruction.    The question is often asked, Is there any difference between the  Spirit of the Lord and the Holy Ghost? The terms are frequently used  synonymously. We often say the Spirit of God when we mean the Holy  Ghost; we likewise say the Holy Ghost when we mean the Spirit of God.  The Holy Ghost is a personage in the Godhead, and is not that which  lighteth every man that cometh into the world. It is the Spirit of  God which proceeds through Christ to the world, that enlightens every  man that comes into the world, and that strives with the children of  men, and will continue to strive with them, until it brings them to  a knowledge of the truth and the possession of the greater light and  testimony of the Holy Ghost. If, however, he receive that greater  light, and then sin against it, the Spirit of God will cease to strive  with him, and the Holy Ghost will wholly depart from him. Then will he  persecute the truth; then will he seek the blood of the innocent; then  will he not scruple at the commission of any crime, except so far as  he may fear the penalties of the law, in consequence of the crime upon  himself.    \"And that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father  and I are one.\" I do not apprehend that any intelligent person will  construe these words to mean that Jesus and his Father are one person,  but merely that they {83} are one in knowledge, in truth, in wisdom,  in understanding, and in purpose; just as the Lord Jesus himself  admonished his disciples to be one with him, and to be in him, that he  might be in them. It is in this sense that I understand this language,  and not as it is construed by some people, that Christ and his Father  are one person. I declare to you that they are not one person, but that  they are two persons, two bodies, separate and apart, and as distinct  as are any father and son within the sound of my voice. Yet, Jesus is  the Father of this world, because it was by him that the world was made.    Even Christ himself was not perfect at first; he received not a fulness  at first, but he received grace for grace, and he continued to receive  more and more until he received a fulness. Is not this to be so with  the children of men? Is any man perfect? Has any man received a fulness  at once? Have we reached a point wherein we may receive the fulness of  God, of his glory, and his intelligence? No; and yet, if Jesus, the Son  of God, and the Father of the heavens and the earth in which we dwell,  received not a fulness at the first, but increased in faith, knowledge,  understanding and grace until he received a fulness, is it not possible  for all men who are born of women to receive little by little, line  upon line, precept upon precept, until they shall receive a fulness, as  he has received a fulness, and be exalted with him in the presence of  the Father?    The spirit without the body is not perfect, and the body without the  spirit is dead. Man was ordained in the beginning to become like Jesus  Christ, to become conformed unto his image. As Jesus was born of woman,  lived and grew to manhood, was put to death and raised from the dead  to immortality and eternal life, so it was decreed in the beginning  that man should be, and will be, through the atonement of Jesus,  in spite of himself, resurrected from the dead. Death came upon us  without the exercise of our {84} agency; we had no hand in bringing it  originally upon ourselves; it came because of the transgression of our  first parents. Therefore, man, who had no hand in bringing death upon  himself, shall have no hand in bringing again life unto himself; for  as he dies in consequence of the sin of Adam, so shall he live again,  whether he will or not, by the righteousness of Jesus Christ, and the  power of his resurrection. Every man that dies shall live again, and  shall stand before the bar of God, to be judged according to his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47132"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 7 (of 8) (#19)"],[1,"De  Lisle's column, now marched to Harrismith, collecting nearly 2000  horses on the way, and returning afterwards to Vrede. There, at the  end of the month, he was met by Colonels Bethune and Lowe, who had  remained behind to operate north and west of Witkoppies--the position  south of Botha's Pass whence the Boers had been dislodged.    [Illustration: THE CAPTURE OF DE WET'S CONVOY AT REITZ, JUNE 6, 1901:  THE ATTACK UPON THE BOER WAGGONS BY COLONEL DE LISLE'S FORCE    Drawing by R. Caton Woodville]    On the 3rd of June General Elliot, having replenished his supplies  from Standerton, moved from Vrede towards Kroonstad _via_ Reitz and  Lindley. It was on the way to Reitz that one of the most exciting  conflicts of the march took place. A night swoop on Graspan had been  planned for the purpose of intercepting a Boer convoy (said to be De  Wet's), which had been located in the neighbourhood. Accordingly, in  the small hours of the 6th, Major Sladen, with 400 Mounted Infantry of  Colonel De Lisle's force, made his way to the laager. The movement was  executed with the utmost secrecy, and before they knew of the coming  of the troops the Boers in their slumbers found themselves surrounded.  All that could get away bolted precipitately, but forty-five prisoners  were secured. Then Major Sladen, after sending some forty of his party  to communicate with Colonel De Lisle, took up a defensive position and  awaited reinforcements. During the interval the fleeing Boers had a  chance to draw breath; they calculated the smallness of the British  party by which they had been attacked, and knew that, weighted with  prisoners and waggons, it would be impossible for them to move on.  They presently came on Fouche, who was marching in this direction with  500 men, and with him returned to the rescue of their comrades of the  laager, and made a vigorous struggle to regain the convoy. The small  and fatigued British party remained gallant as ever. Captain Finlay  (Bedford Regiment) and Captain Langley (South African Bushmen) and  their men met the attack with immense energy, but in the course of the  action the Boers succeeded in getting away some of the waggons which  were parked outside the position.    [Illustration: COLONEL DE LISLE    (Photo by J. Edwards, London)]    They nevertheless (though egged on by De Wet and Delarey, who chanced  to be on their way to the Transvaal) failed to make any impression on  Major Sladen's superb defence, which was doggedly sustained till 3  P.M. By this time the first reinforcement from De Lisle's force was  seen to be advancing, and the enemy in hot haste tore off, taking with  them such waggons as they had secured. But they were swiftly pursued.  Fighting recommenced with ferocity--hand-to-hand combats on all  sides--and the waggons, all but two, were recaptured. Among the deeds  of valour which were numerous on this memorable occasion, was the  dashing exploit of young Ashburner, who, at the head of a few men,  plunged into the thick of the fray, and at point of bayonet effected  the recapture of the leading waggons.    Poor Lieutenant Cameron of the Gordon Highlanders, who had many times  before been notable for conspicuous gallantry, was killed. A gallant  young officer, White of the Gordon Highlanders, escaped by a marvel.  He was taken prisoner during the first fight, and stripped by the  Boers; but when the second attack commenced he succeeded in escaping,  and, further, managed to run six miles and bring up reinforcements.    But such hard fighting was not carried on without heavy cost--that of  3 officers and 17 men killed, and 1 officer and 24 men wounded. The  enemy lost 14 dead, 6 wounded, and 45 taken prisoners, in addition to  a number of injured which were carried away in carts. The captures  included 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 114 waggons and carts, 4000  cattle, and a quantity of foodstuffs.    More captures were made later, near Lindley, and the force, heavily  weighted, arrived at Kroonstad on the 14th and 15th of June. From  thence, on the 22nd, they swept eastward, between Lindley and Senekal,  towards the line of the Wilge River. On the 2nd of July, at  Springfield Drift, some twenty miles north of Harrismith, they  received supplies sent out by General Rundle. This officer was now  preparing to co-operate with General Elliot, and to march north, on  his right, through the country east of the Wilge River, while General  Bullock should traverse the country from Standerton to Frankfort _via_  Villiersdorp, and thus serve as a stop for any Boers who might be  swept that way.          CHAPTER VII    GENERAL BRUCE-HAMILTON'S OPERATIONS, ORANGE RIVER COLONY (SOUTH)      General Bruce-Hamilton, as we know, succeeded General Lyttelton in his  command on the 13th of April, and proceeded to spend the rest of the  month in clearing the Orange River Colony, the Smithfield, Zastron,  and Rouxville districts, on the east of the railway. Engaged in this  work were Colonels Hickman, Monro, Maxwell, and White. Hearing that  the enemy was massing in the hills round Philippolis, he directed  Colonel W. Williams to move with three columns from the railway to the  western border. From the 10th to the 19th of May was spent in marching  through the Philippolis district, mopping up Boers, horses, and stock.  Thirty-three prisoners were taken, including Commandant Bothma. About  this date a brilliant little piece of work was performed by Major  Gogarty and four squadrons of the South African Light Horse. A gang of  raiders was known to be hovering in the region of Luckhoff, therefore  this officer, with his dashing party, was ordered to surprise and, if  possible, seize them. The affair was managed with consummate skill,  the troops marching by night and surrounding the marauders. Of these,  armed, they captured thirty-one, together with their horses.    Colonel Byng now remained behind to hold Philippolis, while Colonel  Williams returned to the railway at Prior Siding. At this time a new  system of blockhouses was inaugurated for the defence of the railway,  which had the effect of releasing for active operations some six  thousand of the troops previously required to guard it. The whole of  these blockhouses were constructed of wood and iron. The walls  consisted of two skins of corrugated iron (six inches apart) filled  with sharp sand. On the _complete_ filling of these skins the proof of  the blockhouse against rifle fire entirely depended. The filling was  done from the inside at the eaves and through holes in the sills of  the loopholes, and was kept complete from time to time by order of the  officer in charge by working new sand through the holes in the sill by  means of a shovel and piece of wood. To prevent blockhouses from being  seen through from one loophole to another, screens of blankets or  sacking were suspended at right angles to each other crossing the  centre of the blockhouse. A barbed wire spiderwebbing and fence  surrounded the blockhouse, the entrance to which was firmly closed at  night. A 200-gallon bullet-proof cased tank for water (rain water or  that brought by water-carts) was kept outside the house, but on  emergency water could be obtained by digging a few feet deep within  the wired area round most of the houses. These preparations and  precautions were none too many, as the Boers were constantly at  mischief, and on the 18th they managed to derail a train at America  Siding--an incident which cost the life of Major Heath (3rd Battalion  South Lancashire Regiment).    [Illustration: A TYPICAL BLOCKHOUSE]    About the 19th of May, owing to the villainous activities of the  guerillas in the north of Cape Colony, Colonel Monro moved to join the  troops operating near Steynsburg, and subsequently Colonel Murray  crossed into the Cape Colony. Colonel Maxwell (R.E.), to the deep  regret of his colleagues and of all who knew of his distinguished  services as leader of the Colonial Division under General Brabant,  succumbed to the serious injuries received by being thrown from his  horse. Early in June Colonel White proceeded to Aliwal North to act in  combination with Colonel Haig, who was still chasing Kruitzinger. At  this time, in accordance with General Bruce-Hamilton's plan of  scouring the country towards Petrusburg, his force was split into  seven small columns. More columns, co-operating, advanced from the  line of Kaffir River, Jagersfontein Road, Luckhoff, and Koffyfontein,  so as to converge on Petrusburg; while Colonel Henry's force  co-operated through Wolvekop (near Luckhoff), and the Kimberley column  moved near Koffyfontein. Another force, moving from Bloemfontein,  operated westward from Kaffir River Station. To block retreat to the  north, the South African Constabulary occupied posts along the line of  country between Bloemfontein and Petrusburg; and higher up, the Modder  River drifts, between Abraham's Kraal and Paardeberg, were guarded by  General Knox's troops. The movement took from the 5th to the 8th of  June, during which time many laagers were surprised (one by the  Burgher Police under Lieutenant Bayley), and 268 prisoners with  various stores and effects secured. These activities were followed by  others of a similar nature against roving gangs--under the Commandants  Brand, Kolbe, and Joubert--which infested the country east of the  railway, between the Caledon River on the south, and the line  Edenburg-Reddersburg-Dewetsdorp on the north. Fights and skirmishes  and snipings continued almost daily, and the columns of Colonels  Rochfort, White, and Du Moulin had no reason to complain of lack of  excitement. On the west of the railway, Colonels Williams and Byng  continued to sweep the districts of Fauresmith, Jacobsdal, and  Philippolis.      MAJOR-GENERAL C. KNOX, ORANGE RIVER COLONY (CENTRE)    General Charles Knox, in accordance with the scheme of General  Elliot's operations, remained in the Senekal district till the "]]]
