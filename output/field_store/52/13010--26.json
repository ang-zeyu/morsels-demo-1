Kindness in looks and words and ways is  true politeness, and any one can have it if they only try to treat other  people as they like to be treated themselves.\"    Mrs. Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan, but the boys nudged one  another, and appeared to take the hint, for that time at least, and  passed the butter; said \"please,\" and \"thank you,\" \"yes, sir,\" and \"no,  ma'am,\" with unusual elegance and respect. Nan said nothing, but kept  herself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi, though strongly tempted  to do so, because of the dignified airs he put on. She also appeared  to have forgotten her hatred of boys, and played \"I spy\" with them till  dark. Stuffy was observed to offer her frequent sucks on his candy-ball  during the game, which evidently sweetened her temper, for the last  thing she said on going to bed was,    \"When my battledore and shuttle-cock comes, I'll let you all play with  'em.\"    Her first remark in the morning was \"Has my box come?\" and when told  that it would arrive sometime during the day, she fretted and fumed, and  whipped her doll, till Daisy was shocked. She managed to exist, however,  till five o'clock, when she disappeared, and was not missed till  supper-time, because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with  Tommy and Demi.    \"I saw her going down the avenue alone as hard as she could pelt,\"  said Mary Ann, coming in with the hasty-pudding, and finding every one  asking, \"Where is Nan?\"    \"She has run home, little gypsy!\" cried Mrs. Bhaer, looking anxious.    \"Perhaps she has gone to the station to look after her luggage,\"  suggested Franz.    \"That is impossible, she does not know the way, and if she found it, she  could never carry the box a mile,\" said Mrs. Bhaer, beginning to think  that her new idea might be rather a hard one to carry out.    \"It would be like her,\" and Mr. Bhaer caught up his hat to go and find  the child, when a shout from Jack, who was at the window, made everyone  hurry to the door.    There was Miss Nan, to be sure, tugging along a very large band-box tied  up in linen bag. Very hot and dusty and tired did she look, but marched  stoutly along, and came puffing up to the steps, where she dropped  her load with a sigh of relief, and sat down upon it, observed as she  crossed her tired arms,    \"I couldn't wait any longer, so I went and got it.\"    \"But you did not know the way,\" said Tommy, while the rest stood round  enjoying the joke.    \"Oh, I found it, I never get lost.\"    \"It's a mile, how could you go so far?\"    \"Well, it was pretty far, but I rested a good deal.\"    \"Wasn't that thing very heavy?\"    \"It's so round, I couldn't get hold of it good, and I thought my arms  would break right off.\"    \"I don't see how the station-master let you have it,\" said Tommy.    \"I didn't say anything to him. He was in the little ticket place, and  didn't see me, so I just took it off the platform.\"    \"Run down and tell him it is all right, Franz, or old Dodd will think  it is stolen,\" said Mr. Bhaer, joining in the shout of laughter at Nan's  coolness.    \"I told you we would send for it if it did not come. Another time you  must wait, for you will get into trouble if you run away. Promise me  this, or I shall not dare to trust you out of my sight,\" said Mrs.  Bhaer, wiping the dust off Nan's little hot face.    \"Well, I won't, only papa tells me not to put off doing things, so I  don't.\"    \"That is rather a poser; I think you had better give her some supper  now, and a private lecture by and by,\" said Mr. Bhaer, too much amused  to be angry at the young lady's exploit.    The boys thought it \"great fun,\" and Nan entertained them all  supper-time with an account of her adventures; for a big dog had barked  at her, a man had laughed at her, a woman had given her a doughnut, and  her hat had fallen into the brook when she stopped to drink, exhausted  with her exertion.    \"I fancy you will have your hands full now, my dear; Tommy and Nan are  quite enough for one woman,\" said Mr. Bhaer, half an hour later.    \"I know it will take some time to tame the child, but she is such a  generous, warm-hearted little thing, I should love her even if she were  twice as naughty,\" answered Mrs. Jo, pointing to the merry group, in  the middle of which stood Nan, giving away her things right and left, as  lavishly as if the big band-box had no bottom.    It was those good traits that soon made little \"Giddygaddy,\" as they  called her, a favorite with every one. Daisy never complained of being  dull again, for Nan invented the most delightful plays, and her pranks  rivalled Tommy's, to the amusement of the whole school. She buried her  big doll and forgot it for a week, and found it well mildewed when she  dragged it up. Daisy was in despair, but Nan took it to the painter who  as at work about the house, got him to paint it brick red, with staring  black eyes, then she dressed it up with feathers, and scarlet flannel,  and one of Ned's leaden hatchets; and in the character of an Indian  chief, the late Poppydilla tomahawked all the other dolls, and caused  the nursery to run red with imaginary gore. She gave away her new shoes  to a beggar child, hoping to be allowed to go barefoot, but found it  impossible to combine charity and comfort, and was ordered to ask leave  before disposing of her clothes. She delighted the boys by making a  fire-ship out of a shingle with two large sails wet with turpentine,  which she lighted, and then sent the little vessel floating down the  brook at dusk. She harnessed the old turkey-cock to a straw wagon, and  made him trot round the house at a tremendous pace. She gave her coral  necklace for four unhappy kittens, which had been tormented by some  heartless lads, and tended them for days as gently as a mother, dressing  their wounds with cold cream, feeding them with a doll's spoon, and  mourning over them when they died, till she was consoled by one of  Demi's best turtles. She made Silas tattoo an anchor on her arm like  his, and begged hard to have a blue star on each cheek, but he dared not  do it, though she coaxed and scolded till the soft-hearted fellow longed  to give in. She rode every animal on the place, from the big horse Andy  to the cross pig, from whom she was rescued with difficulty. Whatever  the boys dared her to do she instantly attempted, no matter how  dangerous it might be, and they were never tired of testing her courage.    Mr. Bhaer suggested that they should see who would study best, and Nan  found as much pleasure in using her quick wits and fine memory as her  active feet and merry tongue, while the lads had to do their best to  keep their places, for Nan showed them that girls could do most things  as well as boys, and some things better. There were no rewards in  school, but Mr. Bhaer's \"Well done!\" and Mrs. Bhaer's good report on the  conscience book, taught them to love duty for its own sake, and try to  do it faithfully, sure sooner or later the recompense would come. Little  Nan was quick to feel the new atmosphere, to enjoy it, to show that it  was what she needed; for this little garden was full of sweet flowers,  half hidden by the weeds; and when kind hands gently began to  cultivate it, all sorts of green shoots sprung up, promising to blossom  beautifully in the warmth of love and care, the best climate for young  hearts and souls all the world over.        CHAPTER VIII. PRANKS AND PLAYS    As there is no particular plan to this story, except to describe a few  scenes in the life at Plumfield for the amusement of certain little  persons, we will gently ramble along in this chapter and tell some of  the pastimes of Mrs. Jo's boys. I beg leave to assure my honored readers  that most of the incidents are taken from real life, and that the oddest  are the truest; for no person, no matter how vivid an imagination he may  have, can invent anything half so droll as the freaks and fancies that  originate in the lively brains of little people.    Daisy and Demi were full of these whims, and lived in a world of their  own, peopled with lovely or grotesque creatures, to whom they gave the  queerest names, and with whom they played the queerest games. One of  these nursery inventions was an invisible sprite called \"The Naughty  Kitty-mouse,\" whom the children had believed in, feared, and served for  a long time. They seldom spoke of it to any one else, kept their rites  as private as possible; and, as they never tried to describe it even to  themselves, this being had a vague mysterious charm very agreeable  to Demi, who delighted in elves and goblins. A most whimsical and  tyrannical imp was the Naughty Kitty-mouse, and Daisy found a fearful  pleasure in its service, blindly obeying its most absurd demands, which  were usually proclaimed from the lips of Demi, whose powers of invention  were great. Rob and Teddy sometimes joined in these ceremonies, and  considered them excellent fun, although they did not understand half  that went on.    One day after school Demi whispered to his sister, with an ominous wag  of the head,    \"The Kitty-mouse wants us this afternoon.\"    \"What for?\" asked Daisy, anxiously.    \"A sackerryfice,\" answered Demi, solemnly. \"There must be a fire behind  the big rock at two o'clock, and we must all bring the things we like  best, and burn them!\" he added, with an awful emphasis on the last  words.    \"Oh, dear! I love the new paper dollies Aunt Amy painted for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#19)"],[1,"is the hind foot of a Snowshoe in winter, contrasted with the hind  foot of a Jackrabbit that was nearly three times its weight.    Rabbits are low in the scale of intelligence, but they are high enough  to have some joy in social life. It always gives one a special thrill of  satisfaction when favoured with a little glimpse into the home ways, the  games, or social life of an animal; and the peep I had into the Rabbit  world one night, though but a small affair, I have always remembered  with pleasure, and hope for a second similar chance.    This took place in the Bitterroot Mountains in Idaho, in 1902. My wife  and I were out on a pack-train trip with two New York friends. We had  seen some rough country in Colorado and Wyoming, but we soon agreed that  the Bitterroots were the roughest of all the mountains. It took  twenty-eight horses to carry the stuff, for which eighteen were enough  in the more southern Rockies.    [Illustration]    The trails were so crooked and hidden in thick woods, that sometimes  the man at the rear might ride the whole day, and never see all the  horses until we stopped again for the night.      THE TERROR OF THE MOUNTAIN TRAILS    [Illustration]    There were other annoyances, and among them a particularly dangerous  animal. The country was fairly stocked with Moose, Elk, Blacktail,  Sheep, Goats, Badgers, Skunks, Wolverines, Foxes, Coyotes, Mountain  Lions, Lynx, Wolves, Black Bears and Grizzly Bears, but it was none of  these that inspired us with fear. The deadly, dangerous creature, the  worst of all, was the common Yellow-Jacket-Wasp. These Wasps abounded in  the region. Their nests were so plentiful that many were on, or by, the  narrow crooked trails that we must follow. Generally these trails were  along the mountain shoulder with a steep bank on the upside, and a sheer  drop on the other. It was at just such dangerous places that we seemed  most often to find the Yellow-Jackets at home. Roused by the noise and  trampling, they would assail the horses in swarms, and then there would  be a stampede of bucking, squealing, tortured animals. Some would be  forced off the trail, and, as has often happened elsewhere, dashed to  their death below. This was the daily danger.    [Illustration]    One morning late in September we left camp about eight, and set off in  the usual line, the chief guide leading and the rest of us distributed  at intervals among the pack-horses, as a control. Near the rear was the  cook, after him a pack-horse with tins and dishes, and last of all  myself.    At first we saw no wasps, as the morning was frosty, but about ten the  sun had become strong, the air was quite mild, and the wasps became  lively. For all at once I heard the dreaded cry, \"_Yellow-Jackets_!\"  Then in a moment it was taken up by the cook just ahead of me.  \"Yellow-Jackets! look out!\" with a note almost of terror in his voice.    At once his horse began to plunge and buck. I saw the man of pots  clinging to the saddle and protecting his face as best he could, while  his mount charged into the bushes and disappeared.    Then \"_bzz-z-z-z_\" they went at the pot-horse and again the bucking and  squealing, with pots going clank, clink, rattle and away.    \"_Bzz-z-z-z-z_\" and in a moment the dark and raging little terrors came  at me in a cloud. I had no time to stop, or get off, or seek another  way. So I jerked up a coat collar to save my face, held my head low, and  tried to hold on, while the little pony went insane with the fiery  baptism now upon him. Plunging, kicking, and squealing he went, and I  stuck, to him for one--two--three jumps, but at number four, as I  remember it, I went flying over his head, fortunately up hill, and  landed in the bushes unhurt, but ready for peace at any price.    It is good old wisdom to \"lay low in case of doubt,\" and very low I lay  there, waiting for the war to cease. It was over in a few seconds, for  my horse dashed after his fellows and passed through the bushes, so that  the winged scorpions were left behind. Presently I lifted my head and  looked cautiously toward the wasp's-nest. It was in a bank twenty feet  away, and the angry swarm was hovering over it, like smoke from a vent  hole. They were too angry, and I was too near, to run any risks, so I  sank down again and waited. In one or two minutes I peered once more,  getting a sight under a small log lying eight or ten feet away. And as I  gazed waspward my eye also took in a brown furry creature calmly sitting  under the log, wabbling his nose at me and the world about him. It was a  young Snowshoe Rabbit.    [Illustration]      BUNNY'S RIDE    There is a certain wild hunter instinct in us all, a wish to capture  every wood creature we meet. That impulse came on me in power. There was  no more danger from wasps, so I got cautiously above this log, put a  hand down at each side, grabbed underneath, and the Rabbit was my  prisoner. Now I had him, what was I going to do with him--kill him?  Certainly not. I began to talk to him. \"Now what _did_ I catch you for?\"  His only reply was a wobble of his nose, so I continued: \"I didn't know  when I began, but I know now. I want to get your picture.\" And again the  nose wobbled.    I could not take it then as my camera had gone on with my horse. I had  nothing to put the Rabbit in. I could not put it in my pocket as that  would mean crushing it in some early tumble; I needed both my hands to  climb with and catch my horse, so for lack of a better place I took off  my hat and said, \"Bunny, how would you like to ride in that?\" He wobbled  his nose, which I understood to mean that he didn't care. So I put the  Rabbit on my head, and put the hat on again.    [Illustration]    Then I went forward and found that the cook had recovered his pots and  pans; all was well now and my horse was awaiting me.    I rode all the rest of that day with the Rabbit quietly nestling in my  hair. It was a long, hard day, for we continued till nightfall and then  made a dark camp in a thick pine woods. It was impossible to make  pictures then, so I put the little Rabbit under a leatheroid telescope  lid, on a hard level place, gave him food and water, and left him for  use in the morning.      THE RABBIT DANCE    About nine o'clock that night we were sitting about the fire, when from  the near woods was heard a tremendous \"_tap-tap-taptrrr_,\" so loud and  so near that we all jumped and stared into the darkness. Again it came,  \"_tap-tap-tap trrrrr_,\" a regular drum tattoo.    \"What is that?\" we all exclaimed, and at that moment a large Rabbit  darted across the open space lighted by the fire.    Again the tattoo and another Rabbit dashed across. Then it dawned on me  that that was the young Rabbit signalling to his friends. He was using  the side of his box for a drum.    Again the little prisoner rolled his signal call, and then a third  Snowshoe Rabbit appeared.    \"Look at all the Rabbits!\" exclaimed my friend. \"Where is my gun?\"    \"No,\" I said, \"you don't need your gun. Wait and see. There is something  up. That little chap is ringing up central.\"    \"I never saw so many together in all my life,\" said he. Then added:  \"I've got an acetylene lantern; perhaps we can get a picture.\"    [Illustration]    As soon as he had his camera and lantern, we went cautiously to the  rabbity side of the woods; several ran past us. Then we sat down on a  smooth place. My friend held the camera, I held the light, but we rested  both on the ground. Very soon a Rabbit darted from the darkness into the  great cone of light from the lantern, gazed at that wonder for a moment,  gave a \"thump\" and disappeared. Then another came; then two or three.  They gazed into this unspeakably dazzling thing, then one gave the alarm  by thumping, and all were lost to sight.    But they came again and in ever-increasing numbers, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 at  last, now in plain view, gazing wildly at the bright light, pushing  forward as though fascinated. Some two or three so close together that  they were touching each other. Then one gave the thumping alarm, and all  scattered like leaves, to vanish like ghosts. But they came back again,  to push and crawl up nearer to that blazing wonder. Some of the back  ones were skipping about but the front ones edged up in a sort of  wild-eyed fascination. Closer and closer they got, then the first one  was so near that reaching out to smell the lantern he burnt his nose,  and at his alarm thump, all disappeared in the woods. But they soon  returned to disport again in that amazing brightness; and, stimulated  by the light, they danced about, chasing each other, dodging around in  large circles till one of the outermost leaped over the camera box and  another following him, leaped up and sat on it. My friend was just  behind, hidden by the light in front, and he had no trouble in clutching  the impudent Rabbit with both hands. Instantly it set up a loud  squealing. The other Rabbits gave a stamping signal, and in a moment all  were lost in the woods, but the one we held. Quickly we transported it  to another leatheroid box, intending to take its picture in the morning,  but the prisoner had a means of attack that I had not counted on. Just  as we were going to sleep he began with his front feet on the resounding  box and beat a veritable drum tattoo of alarm. Every one in camp was  awakened, and again, as we were dropping off, the camp was roused by  another loud \"tattoo.\" For nearly two hours this went on; then, about  midnight, utterly unable to sleep, I arose and let the drummer go about  his business, do anything or go anywhere, so only he would be quiet and  let us attend to ours.
