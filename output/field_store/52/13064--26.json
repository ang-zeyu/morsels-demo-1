Rooke is away on some business for      Rupert, and will not be back for some time; Rupert thinks it may be a      couple of months.  There is no one else that he could send to take      charge of the party from home, and I don't like the idea of all those      lassies coming out without an escort.  Even Lachlan and Sandy's Mary      are ignorant of foreign languages and foreign ways.  But as soon as      Rooke returns we can have them all out.  I dare say you will have      some of your clansmen ready by then, and I think the poor girls, who      may feel a bit strange in a new country like this, where the ways are      so different from ours, will feel easier when they know that there      are some of their own mankind near them.  Perhaps it might be well      that those of them who are engaged to each other--I know there are      some--should marry before they come out here.  It will be more      convenient in many ways, and will save lodgment, and, besides, these      Blue Mountaineers are very handsome men.  Good-night.                                                                        JANET.    _Sir Colin MacKelpie_, _Croom_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_.                                                              _March_ 9, 1907.        MY DEAR JANET,        I have duly received both your letters, and am delighted to find you      are so well pleased with your new home.  It must certainly be a very      lovely and unique place, and I am myself longing to see it.  I came      up here three days ago, and am, as usual, feeling all the better for      a breath of my native air.  Time goes on, my dear, and I am beginning      to feel not so young as I was.  Tell Rupert that the men are all fit,      and longing to get out to him.  They are certainly a fine lot of men.      I don't think I ever saw a finer.  I have had them drilled and      trained as soldiers, and, in addition, have had them taught a lot of      trades just as they selected themselves.  So he shall have nigh him      men who can turn their hands to anything--not, of course, that they      all know every trade, but amongst them there is someone who can do      whatever may be required.  There are blacksmiths, carpenters,      farriers, saddle-makers, gardeners, plumbers, cutlers, gunsmiths, so,      as they all are farmers by origin and sportsmen by practice, they      will make a rare household body of men.  They are nearly all      first-class shots, and I am having them practise with revolvers.      They are being taught fencing and broadsword and ju-jitsu; I have      organized them in military form, with their own sergeants and      corporals.  This morning I had an inspection, and I assure you, my      dear, they could give points to the Household troop in matters of      drill.  I tell you I am proud of my clansmen!        I think you are quite wise about waiting to bring out the lassies,      and wiser still about the marrying.  I dare say there will be more      marrying when they all get settled in a foreign country.  I shall be      glad of it, for as Rupert is going to settle there, it will be good      for him to have round him a little colony of his own people.  And it      will be good for them, too, for I know he will be good to them--as      you will, my dear.  The hills are barren here, and life is hard, and      each year there is more and more demand for crofts, and sooner or      later our people must thin out.  And mayhap our little settlement of      MacKelpie clan away beyond the frontiers of the Empire may be some      service to the nation and the King.  But this is a dream!  I see that      here I am beginning to realise in myself one part of Isaiah's      prophecy:        \"Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream      dreams.\"        By the way, my dear, talking about dreams, I am sending you out some      boxes of books which were in your rooms.  They are nearly all on odd      subjects that _we_ understand--Second Sight, Ghosts, Dreams (that was      what brought the matter to my mind just now), superstitions,      Vampires, Wehr-Wolves, and all such uncanny folk and things.  I      looked over some of these books, and found your marks and underlining      and comments, so I fancy you will miss them in your new home.  You      will, I am sure, feel more at ease with such old friends close to      you.  I have taken the names and sent the list to London, so that      when you pay me a visit again you will be at home in all ways.  If      you come to me altogether, you will be more welcome still--if      possible.  But I am sure that Rupert, who I know loves you very much,      will try to make you so happy that you will not want to leave him.      So I will have to come out often to see you both, even at the cost of      leaving Croom for so long.  Strange, is it not? that now, when,      through Roger Melton's more than kind remembrance of me, I am able to      go where I will and do what I will, I want more and more to remain at      home by my own ingle.  I don't think that anyone but you or Rupert      could get me away from it.  I am working very hard at my little      regiment, as I call it.  They are simply fine, and will, I am sure,      do us credit.  The uniforms are all made, and well made, too.  There      is not a man of them that does not look like an officer.  I tell you,      Janet, that when we turn out the Vissarion Guard we shall feel proud      of them.  I dare say that a couple of months will do all that can be      done here.  I shall come out with them myself.  Rupert writes me that      he thinks it will be more comfortable to come out direct in a ship of      our own.  So when I go up to London in a few weeks' time I shall see      about chartering a suitable vessel.  It will certainly save a lot of      trouble to us and anxiety to our people.  Would it not be well when I      am getting the ship, if I charter one big enough to take out all your      lassies, too?  It is not as if they were strangers.  After all, my      dear, soldiers are soldiers and lassies are lassies.  But these are      all kinsfolk, as well as clansmen and clanswomen, and I, their Chief,      shall be there.  Let me know your views and wishes in this respect.      Mr. Trent, whom I saw before leaving London, asked me to \"convey to      you his most respectful remembrances\"--these were his very words, and      here they are.  Trent is a nice fellow, and I like him.  He has      promised to pay me a visit here before the month is up, and I look      forward to our both enjoying ourselves.        Good-bye, my dear, and the Lord watch over you and our dear boy.                                                      Your affectionate Uncle,                                                  COLIN ALEXANDER MACKELPIE.          BOOK III: THE COMING OF THE LADY      Rupert Sent Leger's Journal.                                                                _April_ 3, 1907.    I have waited till now--well into midday--before beginning to set down  the details of the strange episode of last night.  I have spoken with  persons whom I know to be of normal type.  I have breakfasted, as usual  heartily, and have every reason to consider myself in perfect health and  sanity.  So that the record following may be regarded as not only true in  substance, but exact as to details.  I have investigated and reported on  too many cases for the Psychical Research Society to be ignorant of the  necessity for absolute accuracy in such matters of even the minutest  detail.    Yesterday was Tuesday, the second day of April, 1907.  I passed a day of  interest, with its fair amount of work of varying kinds.  Aunt Janet and  I lunched together, had a stroll round the gardens after tea--especially  examining the site for the new Japanese garden, which we shall call  \"Janet's Garden.\"  We went in mackintoshes, for the rainy season is in  its full, the only sign of its not being a repetition of the Deluge being  that breaks in the continuance are beginning.  They are short at present  but will doubtless enlarge themselves as the season comes towards an end.  We dined together at seven.  After dinner I had a cigar, and then joined  Aunt Janet for an hour in her drawing-room.  I left her at half-past ten,  when I went to my own room and wrote some letters.  At ten minutes past  eleven I wound my watch, so I know the time accurately.  Having prepared  for bed, I drew back the heavy curtain in front of my window, which opens  on the marble steps into the Italian garden.  I had put out my light  before drawing back the curtain, for I wanted to have a look at the scene  before turning in.  Aunt Janet has always had an old-fashioned idea of  the need (or propriety, I hardly know which) of keeping windows closed  and curtains drawn.  I am gradually getting her to leave my room alone in  this respect, but at present the change is in its fitful stage, and of  course I must not hurry matters or be too persistent, as it would hurt  her feelings.  This night was one of those under the old regime.  It was  a delight to look out, for the scene was perfect of its own kind.  The  long spell of rain--the ceaseless downpour which had for the time flooded  everywhere--had passed, and water in abnormal places rather trickled than  ran.  We were now beginning to be in the sloppy rather than the deluged  stage.  There was plenty of light to see by, for the moon had begun to  show out fitfully through the masses of flying clouds.  The uncertain  light made weird shadows with the shrubs and statues in the garden.  The  long straight walk which leads from the marble steps is strewn with fine  sand white from the quartz strand in the nook to the south of the Castle.  Tall shrubs of white holly, yew, juniper, cypress, and variegated maple  and spiraea, which stood at intervals along the walk and its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#19)"],[1,"  So take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.  She's thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim  Hence to depart well quit of all these ills.    CREON  Say, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?    GUARD  Burying the man.  There's nothing more to tell.    CREON  Hast thou thy wits?  Or know'st thou what thou say'st?    GUARD  I saw this woman burying the corpse  Against thy orders.  Is that clear and plain?    CREON  But how was she surprised and caught in the act?    GUARD  It happened thus.  No sooner had we come,  Driven from thy presence by those awful threats,  Than straight we swept away all trace of dust,  And bared the clammy body.  Then we sat  High on the ridge to windward of the stench,  While each man kept he fellow alert and rated  Roundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.  So all night long we watched, until the sun  Stood high in heaven, and his blazing beams  Smote us.  A sudden whirlwind then upraised  A cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,  And swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,  And shook the firmament.  We closed our eyes  And waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.  At last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.  A piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,  As when the mother bird beholds her nest  Robbed of its nestlings; even so the maid  Wailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,  And cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.  Anon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,  Then, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,  Thrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.  We at the sight swooped down on her and seized  Our quarry.  Undismayed she stood, and when  We taxed her with the former crime and this,  She disowned nothing.  I was glad--and grieved;  For 'tis most sweet to 'scape oneself scot-free,  And yet to bring disaster to a friend  Is grievous.  Take it all in all, I deem  A man's first duty is to serve himself.    CREON  Speak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,  Does thou plead guilty or deny the deed?    ANTIGONE  Guilty.  I did it, I deny it not.    CREON (to GUARD)  Sirrah, begone whither thou wilt, and thank  Thy luck that thou hast 'scaped a heavy charge.  (To ANTIGONE)  Now answer this plain question, yes or no,  Wast thou acquainted with the interdict?    ANTIGONE  I knew, all knew; how should I fail to know?    CREON  And yet wert bold enough to break the law?    ANTIGONE  Yea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus,  And she who sits enthroned with gods below,  Justice, enacted not these human laws.  Nor did I deem that thou, a mortal man,  Could'st by a breath annul and override  The immutable unwritten laws of Heaven.  They were not born today nor yesterday;  They die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang.  I was not like, who feared no mortal's frown,  To disobey these laws and so provoke  The wrath of Heaven.  I knew that I must die,  E'en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death  Is thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.  For death is gain to him whose life, like mine,  Is full of misery.  Thus my lot appears  Not sad, but blissful; for had I endured  To leave my mother's son unburied there,  I should have grieved with reason, but not now.  And if in this thou judgest me a fool,  Methinks the judge of folly's not acquit.    CHORUS  A stubborn daughter of a stubborn sire,  This ill-starred maiden kicks against the pricks.    CREON  Well, let her know the stubbornest of wills  Are soonest bended, as the hardest iron,  O'er-heated in the fire to brittleness,  Flies soonest into fragments, shivered through.  A snaffle curbs the fieriest steed, and he  Who in subjection lives must needs be meek.  But this proud girl, in insolence well-schooled,  First overstepped the established law, and then--  A second and worse act of insolence--  She boasts and glories in her wickedness.  Now if she thus can flout authority  Unpunished, I am woman, she the man.  But though she be my sister's child or nearer  Of kin than all who worship at my hearth,  Nor she nor yet her sister shall escape  The utmost penalty, for both I hold,  As arch-conspirators, of equal guilt.  Bring forth the older; even now I saw her  Within the palace, frenzied and distraught.  The workings of the mind discover oft  Dark deeds in darkness schemed, before the act.  More hateful still the miscreant who seeks  When caught, to make a virtue of a crime.    ANTIGONE  Would'st thou do more than slay thy prisoner?    CREON  Not I, thy life is mine, and that's enough.    ANTIGONE  Why dally then?  To me no word of thine  Is pleasant:  God forbid it e'er should please;  Nor am I more acceptable to thee.  And yet how otherwise had I achieved  A name so glorious as by burying  A brother? so my townsmen all would say,  Where they not gagged by terror,  Manifold  A king's prerogatives, and not the least  That all his acts and all his words are law.    CREON  Of all these Thebans none so deems but thou.    ANTIGONE  These think as I, but bate their breath to thee.    CREON  Hast thou no shame to differ from all these?    ANTIGONE  To reverence kith and kin can bring no shame.    CREON  Was his dead foeman not thy kinsman too?    ANTIGONE  One mother bare them and the self-same sire.    CREON  Why cast a slur on one by honoring one?    ANTIGONE  The dead man will not bear thee out in this.    CREON  Surely, if good and evil fare alive.    ANTIGONE  The slain man was no villain but a brother.    CREON  The patriot perished by the outlaw's brand.    ANTIGONE  Nathless the realms below these rites require.    CREON  Not that the base should fare as do the brave.    ANTIGONE  Who knows if this world's crimes are virtues there?    CREON  Not even death can make a foe a friend.    ANTIGONE  My nature is for mutual love, not hate.    CREON  Die then, and love the dead if thou must;  No woman shall be the master while I live.  [Enter ISMENE]    CHORUS            Lo from out the palace gate,            Weeping o'er her sister's fate,            Comes Ismene; see her brow,            Once serene, beclouded now,            See her beauteous face o'erspread            With a flush of angry red.    CREON  Woman, who like a viper unperceived  Didst harbor in my house and drain my blood,  Two plagues I nurtured blindly, so it proved,  To sap my throne.  Say, didst thou too abet  This crime, or dost abjure all privity?    ISMENE  I did the deed, if she will have it so,  And with my sister claim to share the guilt.    ANTIGONE  That were unjust.  Thou would'st not act with me  At first, and I refused thy partnership.    ISMENE  But now thy bark is stranded, I am bold  To claim my share as partner in the loss.    ANTIGONE  Who did the deed the under-world knows well:  A friend in word is never friend of mine.    ISMENE  O sister, scorn me not, let me but share  Thy work of piety, and with thee die.    ANTIGONE  Claim not a work in which thou hadst no hand;  One death sufficeth.  Wherefore should'st thou die?    ISMENE  What would life profit me bereft of thee?    ANTIGONE  Ask Creon, he's thy kinsman and best friend.    ISMENE  Why taunt me?  Find'st thou pleasure in these gibes?    ANTIGONE  'Tis a sad mockery, if indeed I mock.    ISMENE  O say if I can help thee even now.    ANTIGONE  No, save thyself; I grudge not thy escape.    ISMENE  Is e'en this boon denied, to share thy lot?    ANTIGONE  Yea, for thou chosed'st life, and I to die.    ISMENE  Thou canst not say that I did not protest.    ANTIGONE  Well, some approved thy wisdom, others mine.    ISMENE  But now we stand convicted, both alike.    ANTIGONE  Fear not; thou livest, I died long ago  Then when I gave my life to save the dead.    CREON  Both maids, methinks, are crazed.  One suddenly  Has lost her wits, the other was born mad.    ISMENE  Yea, so it falls, sire, when misfortune comes,  The wisest even lose their mother wit.    CREON  I' faith thy wit forsook thee when thou mad'st  Thy choice with evil-doers to do ill.    ISMENE  What life for me without my sister here?    CREON  Say not thy sister _here_:  thy sister's dead.    ISMENE  What, wilt thou slay thy own son's plighted bride?    CREON  Aye, let him raise him seed from other fields.    ISMENE  No new espousal can be like the old.    CREON  A plague on trulls who court and woo our sons.    ANTIGONE  O Haemon, how thy sire dishonors thee!    CREON  A plague on thee and thy accursed bride!    CHORUS  What, wilt thou rob thine own son of his bride?    CREON  'Tis death that bars this marriage, not his sire.    CHORUS  So her death-warrant, it would seem, is sealed.    CREON  By you, as first by me; off with them, guards,  And keep them close.  Henceforward let them learn  To live as women use, not roam at large.  For e'en the bravest spirits run away  When they perceive death pressing on life's heels.    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  Thrice blest are they who never tasted pain!       If once the curse of Heaven attaint a race,       The infection lingers on and speeds apace,  Age after age, and each the cup must drain.    So when Etesian blasts from Thrace downpour       Sweep o'er the blackening main and whirl to land       From Ocean's cavernous depths his ooze and sand,  Billow on billow thunders on the shore.    (Ant. 1)  On the Labdacidae I see descending       Woe upon woe; from days of old some god       Laid on the race a malison, and his rod  Scourges each age with sorrows never ending.    The light that dawned upon its last born son       Is vanished, and the bloody axe of Fate       Has felled the goodly tree that blossomed late.  O Oedipus, by reckless pride undone!    (Str. 2)  Thy might, O Zeus, what mortal power can quell?  Not sleep that lays all else beneath its spell,  Nor moons that never tire:  untouched by Time,            Throned in the dazzling light            That crowns Olympus' height,  Thou reignest King, omnipotent, sublime.              Past, present, and to be,            All bow to thy decree,            All that exceeds the mean by Fate         "]]]
