The upper portion of the  chromosphere is in violent agitation, like the waves of a stormy sea,  and from it rise those red prominences which, it will be recollected,  are such a notable feature in total solar eclipses.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--A section through the Sun, showing how the  prominences rise from the chromosphere.]    The _Corona_ lies next in order outside the chromosphere, and is, so  far as we know, the outermost of the accompaniments of the sun. This  halo of pearly-white light is irregular in outline, and fades away into  the surrounding sky. It extends outwards from the sun to several  millions of miles. As has been stated, we can never see the corona  unless, when during a total solar eclipse, the moon has, for the time  being, hidden the brilliant photosphere completely from our view.    The solar spectrum is really composed of three separate spectra  commingled, _i.e._ those of the photosphere, of the reversing layer, and  of the chromosphere respectively.    If, therefore, the photosphere could be entirely removed, or covered up,  we should see only the spectra of those layers which lie upon it. Such a  state of things actually occurs in a total eclipse of the sun. When the  moon's body has crept across the solar disc, and hidden the last piece  of photosphere, the solar spectrum suddenly becomes what is technically  called \"reversed,\"--the dark lines crossing it changing into bright  lines. This occurs because a strip of those layers which lie immediately  upon the photosphere remains still uncovered. The lower of these layers  has therefore been called the \"reversing layer,\" for want of a better  name. After a second or two this reversed spectrum mostly vanishes, and  an altered spectrum is left to view. Taking into consideration the rate  at which the moon is moving across the face of the sun, and the very  short time during which the spectrum of the reversing layer lasts, the  thickness of that layer is estimated to be not more than a few hundred  miles. In the same way the last of the three spectra--namely, that of  the chromosphere--remains visible for such a time as allows us to  estimate its depth at about ten times that of the reversing layer, or  several thousand miles.    When the chromosphere, in its turn during a total eclipse, has been  covered by the moon, the corona alone is left. This has a distinct  spectrum of its own also; wherein is seen a strange line in the green  portion, which does not tally with that of any element we are acquainted  with upon the earth. This unknown element has received for the time  being the name of \"Coronium.\"          CHAPTER XIII    THE SUN--_continued_      The various parts of the Sun will now be treated of in detail.      I. PHOTOSPHERE.    The photosphere, or \"light-sphere,\" from the Greek [phos] (_phos_),  which means _light_, is, as we have already said, the innermost portion  of the sun which can be seen. Examined through a good telescope it shows  a finely mottled structure, as of brilliant granules, somewhat like rice  grains, with small dark spaces lying in between them. It has been  supposed that we have here the process of some system of circulation by  which the sun keeps sending forth its radiations. In the bright granules  we perhaps see masses of intensely heated matter, rising from the  interior of the sun. The dark interspaces may represent matter which has  become cooled and darkened through having parted with its heat and  light, and is falling back again into the solar furnace.    The _sun spots_, so familiar to every one nowadays, are dark patches  which are often seen to break out in the photosphere (see Plate V., p.  134). They last during various periods of time; sometimes only for a few  days, sometimes so long as a month or more. A spot is usually composed  of a dark central portion called the _umbra_, and a less dark fringe  around this called the _penumbra_ (see Plate VI., p. 136). The umbra  ordinarily has the appearance of a deep hole in the photosphere; but,  that it is a hole at all, has by no means been definitely proved.    [Illustration: PLATE V. THE SUN, SHOWING SEVERAL GROUPS OF SPOTS    From a photograph taken at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The  cross-lines seen on the disc are in no way connected with the Sun, but  belong to the telescope through which the photograph was taken.    (Page 134)]    Sun spots are, as a rule, some thousands of miles across. The umbra of  a good-sized spot could indeed engulf at once many bodies the size of  our earth.    Sun spots do not usually appear singly, but in groups. The total area of  a group of this kind may be of immense extent; even so great as to cover  the one-hundredth part of the whole surface of the sun. Very large  spots, when such are present, may be seen without any telescope; either  through a piece of smoked glass, or merely with the naked eye when the  air is misty, or the sun low on the horizon.    The umbra of a spot is not actually dark. It only appears so in contrast  with the brilliant photosphere around.    Spots form, grow to a large size in comparatively short periods of time,  and then quickly disappear. They seem to shrink away as a consequence of  the photosphere closing in upon them.    That the sun is rotating upon an axis, is shown by the continual change  of position of all spots in one constant direction across his disc. The  time in which a spot is carried completely round depends, however, upon  the position which it occupies upon the sun's surface. A spot situated  near the equator of the sun goes round once in about twenty-five days.  The further a spot is situated from this equator, the longer it takes.  About twenty-seven days is the time taken by a spot situated midway  between the equator and the solar poles. Spots occur to the north of  the sun's equator, as well as to the south; though, since regular  observations have been made--that is to say, during the past fifty years  or so--they appear to have broken out a little more frequently in the  southern parts.    From these considerations it will be seen that the sun does not rotate  as the earth does, but that different portions appear to move at  different speeds. Whether in the neighbourhood of the solar poles the  time of rotation exceeds twenty-seven days we are unable to ascertain,  for spots are not seen in those regions. No explanation has yet been  given of this peculiar rotation; and the most we can say on the subject  is that the sun is not by any means a solid body.    _Faculae_ (Latin, little torches) are brilliant patches which appear here  and there upon the sun's surface, and are in some way associated with  spots. Their displacement, too, across the solar face confirms the  evidence which the spots give us of the sun's rotation.    Our proofs of this rotation are still further strengthened by the  Doppler spectroscopic method of observation alluded to in Chapter XI. As  was then stated, one edge of the sun is thus found to be continually  approaching us, and the other side continually receding from us. The  varying rates of rotation, which the spots and faculae give us, are duly  confirmed by this method.    [Illustration: PLATE VI. PHOTOGRAPH OF A SUNSPOT    This fine picture was taken by the late M. Janssen. The granular  structure of the Sun's surface is here well represented. (From  _Knowledge_.)    (Page 135)]    The first attempt to bring some regularity into the question of  sunspots was the discovery by Schwabe, in 1852, that they were subject  to a regular variation. As a matter of fact they wax and wane in their  number, and the total area which they cover, in the course of a period,  or cycle, of on an average about 11-1/4 years; being at one part of this  period large and abundant, and at another few and small. This period of  11-1/4 years is known as the sun spot cycle. No explanation has yet been  given of the curious round of change, but the period in question seems  to govern most of the phenomena connected with the sun.      II. REVERSING LAYER.    This is a layer of relatively cool gases lying immediately upon the  photosphere. We never see it directly; and the only proof we have of its  presence is that remarkable reversal of the spectrum already described,  when during an instant or two in a total eclipse, the advancing edge of  the moon, having just hidden the brilliant photosphere, is moving across  the fine strip which the layer then presents edgewise towards us. The  fleeting moments during which this reversed spectrum lasts, informs us  that the layer is comparatively shallow; little more indeed than about  500 miles in depth.    The spectrum of the reversing layer, or \"flash spectrum,\" as it is  sometimes called on account of the instantaneous character with which  the change takes place, was, as we have seen, first noticed by Young in  1870; and has been successfully photographed since then during several  eclipses. The layer itself appears to be in a fairly quiescent state; a  marked contrast to the seething photosphere beneath, and the agitated  chromosphere above.      III. THE CHROMOSPHERE.    The Chromosphere--so called from the Greek [chroma] (_chroma_), which  signifies _colour_--is a layer of gases lying immediately upon the  preceding one. Its thickness is, however, plainly much the greater of  the two; for whereas the reversing layer is only revealed to us  _indirectly_ by the spectroscope, a portion of the chromosphere may  clearly be _seen_ in a total eclipse in the form of a strip of scarlet  light. The time which the moon's edge takes to traverse it tells us that  it must be about ten times as deep as the reversing layer, namely, from  5000 to 10,000 miles in depth. Its spectrum shows that it is composed  chiefly of hydrogen, calcium and helium, in the state of vapour. Its red  colour is mainly due to glowing hydrogen.

Nothing was done for a time, but negotiations  proceeded, and soon after the discovery of Jupiter's satellites Cosmo  wrote making a generous offer, which Galileo gladly and enthusiastically  accepted, and at once left Padua for Florence. All his subsequent  discoveries date from Florence.    Thus closed his brilliant and happy career as a professor at the  University of Padua. He had been treated well: his pay had become larger  than that of any Professor of Mathematics up to that time; and, as you  know, immediately after his invention of the telescope the Venetian  Senate, in a fit of enthusiasm, had doubled it and secured it to him for  life wherever he was. To throw up his chair and leave the place the very  next year scarcely seems a strictly honourable procedure. It was legal  enough no doubt, and it is easy for small men to criticize a great one,  but nevertheless I think we must admit that it is a step such as a man  with a keen sense of honour would hardly have taken.    One quite feels and sympathizes with the temptation. Not emolument, but  leisure; freedom from harassing engagements and constant teaching, and  liberty to prosecute his studies day and night without interference:  this was the golden prospect before him. He yielded, but one cannot help  wishing he had not.    As it turned out it was a false step--the first false step of his public  career. When made it was irretrievable, and it led to great misery.    At first it seemed brilliant enough. The great philosopher of the Tuscan  Court was courted and flattered by princes and nobles, he enjoyed a  world-wide reputation, lived as luxuriously as he cared for, had his  time all to himself, and lectured but very seldom, on great occasions or  to a few crowned heads.    His position was in fact analogous to that of Tycho Brahe in his island  of Huen.    Misfortune overtook both. In Tycho's case it arose mainly from the death  of his patron. In Galileo's it was due to a more insidious cause, to  understand which cause aright we must remember the political divisions  of Italy at that date.    Tuscany was a Papal State, and thought there was by no means free.  Venice was a free republic, and was even hostile to the Papacy. In 1606  the Pope had placed it under an interdict. In reply it had ejected every  Jesuit.    Out of this atmosphere of comparative enlightenment and freedom into  that hotbed of mediaevalism and superstition went Galileo with his eyes  open. Keen was the regret of his Paduan and Venetian friends; bitter  were their remonstrances and exhortations. But he was determined to go,  and, not without turning some of his old friends into enemies, he went.    Seldom has such a man made so great a mistake: never, I suppose, has one  been so cruelly punished for it.    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Map of Italy.]    We must remember, however, that Galileo, though by no means a saint, was  yet a really religious man, a devout Catholic and thorough adherent of  the Church, so that he would have no dislike to place himself under her  sway. Moreover, he had been born a Tuscan, his family had lived at  Florence or Pisa, and it felt like going home. His theological attitude  is worthy of notice, for he was not in the least a sceptic. He quite  acquiesces in the authority of the Bible, especially in all matters  concerning faith and conduct; as to its statements in scientific  matters, he argues that we are so liable to misinterpret their meaning  that it is really easier to examine Nature for truth in scientific  matters, and that when direct observation and Scripture seem to clash,  it is because of our fallacious interpretation of one or both of them.  He is, in fact, what one now calls a \"reconciler.\"    It is curious to find such a man prosecuted for heresy, when to-day his  opinions are those of the orthodox among the orthodox. But so it ever  is, and the heresy of one generation becomes the commonplace of the  next.    He accepts Joshua's miracle, for instance, not as a striking poem, but  as a literal fact; and he points out how much more simply it could be  done on the Copernican system by stopping the earth's rotation for a  short time, than by stopping the sun and moon and all the host of heaven  as on the old Ptolemaic system, or again by stopping only the sun and  not any of the other bodies, and so throwing astronomy all wrong.    This reads to us like satire, but no doubt it was his genuine opinion.    These Scriptural reconciliations of his, however, angered the religious  authorities still more. They said it was bad enough for this heretic to  try and upset old _scientific_ beliefs, and to spoil the face of  _Nature_ with his infidel discoveries, but at least he might leave the  Bible alone; and they addressed an indignant remonstrance to Rome, to  protect it from the hands of ignorant laymen.    Thus, wherever he turned he encountered hostility. Of course he had many  friends--some of them powerful like Cosmo, all of them faithful and  sincere. But against the power of Rome what could they do? Cosmo dared  no more than remonstrate, and ultimately his successor had to refrain  from even this, so enchained and bound was the spirit of the rulers of  those days; and so when his day of tribulation came he stood alone and  helpless in the midst of his enemies.    You may wonder, perhaps, why this man should excite so much more  hostility than many another man who was suffered to believe and teach  much the same doctrines unmolested. But no other man had made such  brilliant and exciting discoveries. No man stood so prominently forward  in the eyes of all Christendom as the champion of the new doctrines. No  other man stated them so clearly and forcibly, nor drove them home with  such brilliant and telling illustrations.    And again, there was the memory of his early conflict with the  Aristotelians at Pisa, of his scornful and successful refutation of  their absurdities. All this made him specially obnoxious to the  Aristotelian Jesuits in their double capacity both of priests and of  philosophers, and they singled him out for relentless official  persecution.    Not yet, however, is he much troubled by them. The chief men at Rome  have not yet moved. Messages, however, keep going up from Tuscany to  Rome respecting the teachings of this man, and of the harm he is doing  by his pertinacious preaching of the Copernican doctrine that the earth  moves.    At length, in 1615, Pope Paul V. wrote requesting him to come to Rome to  explain his views. He went, was well received, made a special friend of  Cardinal Barberino--an accomplished man in high position, who became in  fact the next Pope. Galileo showed cardinals and others his telescope,  and to as many as would look through it he showed Jupiter's satellites  and his other discoveries. He had a most successful visit. He talked, he  harangued, he held forth in the midst of fifteen or twenty disputants at  once, confounding his opponents and putting them to shame.    His method was to let the opposite arguments be stated as fully and  completely as possible, himself aiding, and often adducing the most  forcible and plausible arguments against his own views; and then, all  having been well stated, he would proceed to utterly undermine and  demolish the whole fabric, and bring out the truth in such a way as to  convince all honest minds. It was this habit that made him such a  formidable antagonist. He never shrank from meeting an opposing  argument, never sought to ignore it, or cloak it in a cloud of words.  Every hostile argument he seemed to delight in, as a foe to be crushed,  and the better and stronger they sounded the more he liked them. He knew  many of them well, he invented a number more, and had he chosen could  have out-argued the stoutest Aristotelian on his own grounds. Thus did  he lead his adversaries on, almost like Socrates, only to ultimately  overwhelm them in a more hopeless rout. All this in Rome too, in the  heart of the Catholic world. Had he been worldly-wise, he would  certainly have kept silent and unobtrusive till he had leave to go away  again. But he felt like an apostle of the new doctrines, whose mission  it was to proclaim them even in this centre of the world and of the  Church.    Well, he had an audience with the Pope--a chat an hour long--and the two  parted good friends, mutually pleased with each other.    He writes that he is all right now, and might return home when he liked.  But the question began to be agitated whether the whole system of  Copernicus ought not to be condemned as impious and heretical. This view  was persistently urged upon the Pope and College of Cardinals, and it  was soon to be decided upon.    Had Galileo been unfaithful to the Church he could have left them to  stultify themselves in any way they thought proper, and himself have  gone; but he felt supremely interested in the result, and he stayed. He  writes:--         \"So far as concerns the clearing of my own character, I might       return home immediately; but although this new question regards me       no more than all those who for the last eighty years have supported       those opinions both in public and private, yet, as perhaps I may be       of some assistance in that part of the discussion which depends on       the knowledge of truths ascertained by means of the sciences which       I profess, I, as a zealous and Catholic Christian, neither can nor       ought to withhold that assistance which my knowledge affords, and       this business keeps me sufficiently employed.\"    It is possible that his stay was the worst thing for the cause he had at  heart. Anyhow, the result was that the system was condemned, and both  the book of Copernicus and the epitome of it by Kepler were placed on  the forbidden list,[11] and Galileo himself was formally"]]]
