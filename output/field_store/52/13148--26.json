[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37599"],[0,"The Legend of the Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel in the land of Flanders (#19)"],[1,"e, where are you, my lover Ulenspiegel?\"              XXXVI      That Sunday there was held at Bruges the Procession of the Holy  Blood. Claes told his wife that she and Nele ought to go and see the  procession, and that if they did so, it was not impossible they might  find Ulenspiegel in the city. As for himself, he would stay behind  and look after the cottage and be ready to welcome their pilgrim if  he should return.    So the two women went off together. Claes remained at home and sat  himself down on the doorstep and gazed into the deserted village  street. All was quiet as the grave, except now and again for the  crystal sound of the bell of some village church, or, rising and  falling with every little gust of wind from Bruges, the far-off music  of the carillon and the sound of the guns and fireworks that were  being let off in honour of the Holy Blood. But in spite of all these  sounds of joy, Claes was filled with sadness, scanning the grey mist  that hung over the fields for a sight of his son, and trying to hear  his footfall in the jolly rustling of leaves and gay concert of birds  as they sang among the trees. Suddenly he noticed a man coming down  towards him on the road from Maldeghem. It was a man tall of stature,  but it was not Ulenspiegel. And presently Claes saw him come to a stand  beside a field of carrots, and bend down to eat of the vegetables as  if he were starving for food.    \"There's a hungry man sure,\" said Claes to himself.    But after a while the man continued his walk, and passed out of view;  to reappear a little later at the corner of the rue Heron. Claes  recognized him at once as the messenger who had brought the seven  hundred ducats from his brother Josse. He went to meet him, and  asked him in.    \"Blessed are they that are kind to the wandering traveller,\" said  the man, and readily accepted the proffered invitation.    Now on the window-ledge of the cottage window lay some bread-crumbs  which Soetkin kept ready for the birds of the neighbourhood, who had  learnt to come there during the winter for their food. The man took  these crumbs and ate them.    \"You must be hungry and thirsty,\" said Claes.    \"Eight days ago was I robbed by thieves,\" the man replied, \"and since  then I have had nothing to eat but the carrots I have found in the  fields and roots in the forest.\"    \"Well then,\" said Claes, \"I am thinking it is time you had a good round  meal.\" And so saying he opened the bread-pan. \"Look,\" he continued,  \"here is a dishful of peas, and here are eggs, puddings, hams,  sausages from Ghent, waterzoey, a hotchpotch of fish. And down below  in the cellar there slumbers our good wine from Louvain, made after  the manner of Burgundy wine, all clear and red as rubies. Only the  glasses are wanting now to rouse it from its sleep. And to crown all,  let us put a faggot to the fire. Already I can hear the pudding singing  in the grill! And that's a song of right good cheer, my friend!\"    Claes kept turning the puddings, and as he did so he inquired of the  stranger whether he had seen his son, Ulenspiegel.    \"No,\" was the answer.    \"Then perhaps you bring me news of my brother?\" Claes said, as he  placed the puddings, now well grilled, upon the table, together with  a ham omelette, some cheese, and two big tankards of gleaming Louvain  wine, both red and white.    The man said:    \"Your brother Josse has been done to death upon the rack at Sippenaken  near to Aix. And all because he was a heretic, and bore arms against  the Emperor.\"    Claes was like one mad, and he shook all over, for his wrath was great.    \"Wicked brutes!\" he cried. \"O Josse! My poor Josse!\"    Then the stranger spoke again, but in a voice that held no sweetness.    \"Not in this world, my friend, is to be found just cause either for  joy or for sorrow.\" And he fell to his food. But after a while he  spoke again.    \"You must know that I was able to be of some assistance to your brother  while he was in prison, by pretending that I was one of his relatives,  a peasant from Nieswieler. I am now come hither in obedience to his  command that if I was not killed for the Faith like him, I should go  to you, and charge you in his name to live in the faith and peace of  our Saviour, practising all works of mercy, and educating your son in  secret in the law of Christ. 'That money,' he said, 'which I gave to  my brother was money taken from the poor and ignorant. Let Claes make  use of it in rearing Tyl in the knowledge of God and of His word.'\"    And when he had thus spoken, the messenger gave Claes the kiss of  peace. And Claes made moan and lamentation, saying:    \"Dead upon the rack! Alas! My poor Josse!\" And his grief was so  great that he could not put it from him. Nevertheless, when he saw  that the messenger was consumed with thirst and held out his glass  for more wine, Claes poured out again. But he himself ate and drank  without pleasure.    Now Soetkin and Nele remained away for seven days; and all this time  the messenger stayed beneath the roof of Claes, and every night they  heard Katheline howling in her cottage over the way:    \"Fire! Fire! Make a hole! My soul wants to get out!\"    And Claes went to her, comforting her with gentle words, and afterwards  returned to his own house.    At the end of the seven days the messenger departed. Claes offered  him money, but he would only accept two caroluses with which to feed  himself and find lodging on his way back home.              XXXVII      When Nele and Soetkin returned from Bruges, they found Claes in the  kitchen, sitting on the floor like a tailor, sewing buttons on an  old pair of breeches. Titus Bibulus Schnouffius barked his welcome;  Claes smiled, and Nele smiled in answer. But Soetkin did not take her  eyes from the road, gazing continually in hopes to see her beloved  Ulenspiegel.    All of a sudden she broke silence. \"Look,\" she cried, \"here is the  Provost-Marshal. He is coming along the road with four sergeants of  the peace. They cannot be wanting any one from here, surely! And yet  there are two of them turning off by the cottage!\"    Claes looked up from his work.    \"And the other two have stopped at the front,\" Soetkin said.    Then Claes got up.    \"Who can they want to arrest in this road?\" his wife continued,  and then: \"O Christ! They are coming in here.\"    \"Look to the money!\" cried Claes. \"The caroluses are hidden away behind  the fireplace.\" And with these words he ran out of the kitchen into  the garden. Nele understood what he meant, and saw that he was going  to try and make his escape over the hedge. But the sergeants seized  him by the collar, and now he was hitting out at them in a hopeless  endeavour to break free.    \"He is innocent!\" Nele cried aloud amid her tears. \"He is innocent! Do  not hurt him. It is Claes, my father! O Ulenspiegel, where are  you? Where are you? If you were only here you would kill them both!\"    And she threw herself on one of the sergeants and tore at his face with  her nails. Then she cried out again: \"They will kill him!\" and fell  down upon the grass in the garden, and rolled there in her despair.    Katheline, hearing the noise, had come out from her cottage, and stood  up straight and immovable, gazing at the piteous scene. Then she spoke,  wagging her head:    \"Fire! Fire! Make a hole! My soul wants to get out!\"    Soetkin meanwhile, who had seen nothing of all this, was talking to  the sergeants who had entered the cottage.    \"Kind sirs,\" she began, \"what is it that you are looking for in our  poor dwelling? If it is my son you want, he is far away. Do you feel  equal to a long journey?\"    And she felt quite pleased at the way she was handling the matter. But  it was at this very moment that Nele began to cry aloud for help,  and when Soetkin had made her way into the garden, it was to see  her husband seized by the collar and fighting on the pathway near  the hedge.    \"Hit hard and kill them!\" she cried, and then: \"O Ulenspiegel, where  are you?\"    And she was about to go to the assistance of her man when one of  the sergeants caught hold of her, not indeed without some danger  to himself. And Claes was fighting and hitting out so forcibly that  he would certainly have escaped had not the two sergeants with whom  Soetkin had been talking come out to aid their fellows in the nick of  time. So at last they were able to tie the hands of Claes together,  and to carry him back to the kitchen, whither Nele and Soetkin had  already come, crying and sobbing.    \"Sir Provost,\" Soetkin said, \"what crime has he committed that you  are binding my poor husband thus with cords?\"    \"He is a heretic,\" said one of the sergeants.    \"Heretic!\" cried Soetkin, looking towards her husband. \"You a  heretic! These devils are lying!\"    Claes answered:    \"I resign myself into God's keeping.\"    And they took him away. Nele and Soetkin followed behind, in tears,  believing that they also would be summoned before the judge. They  were joined by many of their friends and neighbours, but when these  heard that it was on a charge of heresy that Claes was walking thus in  chains, fear came upon them and they returned incontinently to their  houses, closing their doors behind them. Only a few young girls had  the courage to approach Claes and say to him:    \"Whither are you going to, Charcoal-burner, in these bonds!\"    \"I go unto the grace of God, my girls,\" he answered them.    So they took him away to the town gaol, and Nele and Soetkin sat  themselves down upon the threshold. And towards evening Soetkin  besought Nele to leave her and to go and see if Ulenspiegel had  perchance returned.              XXXVIII      The news spread quickly through the neighbourhood that a man had  been taken prisoner on a charge of heresy, and that the inquisitor  Titelman, Dean of Renaix, surnamed the Inquisitor without Pity,  had been appointed judge. Now at this time Ulenspiegel was living  at Koolkerke,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#19)"],[1,"risk,\" said the elder of the men as he gave  up his glass to their host and led off the pony, Stephen walking on its  other side.    Though the sun had fallen, the twilight was still glowing, and even on  this wide expanse the air was still. The vast and undulating surface of  the brown and purple moor, varied occasionally by some fantastic rocks,  gleamed in the shifting light. Hesperus was the only star that yet was  visible, and seemed to move before them and lead them on their journey.    \"I hope,\" said the Religious, turning to the elder stranger, \"that if  ever we regain our right, my father, and that we ever can save by the  interposition of divine will seems to me clearly impossible, that you  will never forget how bitter it is to be driven from the soil; and that  you will bring back the people to the land.\"    \"I would pursue our right for no other cause,\" said the father. \"After  centuries of sorrow and degradation, it should never be said, that we  had no sympathy with the sad and the oppressed.\"    \"After centuries of sorrow and degradation,\" said Stephen, \"let it  not be said that you acquired your right only to create a baron or a  squire.\"    \"Nay, thou shalt have thy way, Stephen,\" said his companion, smiling,  \"if ever the good hour come. As many acres as thou choosest for thy new  Jerusalem.\"    \"Call it what you will, Walter,\" replied Stephen; \"but if I ever gain  the opportunity of fully carrying the principle of association into  practice, I will sing 'Nunc me dimittas.'\"    \"'Nunc me dimittas,'\" burst forth the Religious in a voice of thrilling  melody, and she pursued for some minutes the divine canticle. Her  companions gazed on her with an air of affectionate reverence as she  sang; each instant the stars becoming brighter, the wide moor assuming a  darker hue.    \"Now, tell me, Stephen,\" said the Religious, turning her head and  looking round with a smile, \"think you not it would be a fairer lot to  bide this night at some kind monastery, than to be hastening now to that  least picturesque of all creations, a railway station.\"    \"The railways will do as much for mankind as the monasteries did,\" said  Stephen.    \"Had it not been for the railway, we should never have made our visit to  Marney Abbey,\" said the elder of the travellers.    \"Nor seen its last abbot's tomb,\" said the Religious. \"When I marked  your name upon the stone, my father;--woe is me, but I felt sad indeed,  that it was reserved for our blood to surrender to ruthless men that  holy trust.\"    \"He never surrendered,\" said her father. \"He was tortured and hanged.\"    \"He is with the communion of saints,\" said the Religious.    \"I would I could see a communion of Men,\" said Stephen, \"and then there  would be no more violence, for there would be no more plunder.\"    \"You must regain our lands for us, Stephen,\" said the Religious;  \"promise me my father that I shall raise a holy house for pious women,  if that ever hap.\"    \"We will not forget our ancient faith,\" said her father, \"the only old  thing that has not left us.\"    \"I cannot understand,\" said Stephen, \"why you should ever have lost  sight of these papers, Walter.\"    \"You see, friend, they were never in my possession; they were never  mine when I saw them. They were my father's; and he was jealous of all  interference. He was a small yeoman, who had risen in the war time, well  to do in the world, but always hankering after the old tradition that  the lands were ours. This Hatton got hold of him; he did his work well,  I have heard;--certain it is my father spared nothing. It is twenty-five  years come Martinmas since he brought his writ of right; and though  baffled, he was not beaten. But then he died; his affairs were in great  confusion; he had mortgaged his land for his writ, and the war prices  were gone. There were debts that could not be paid. I had no capital for  a farm. I would not sink to be a labourer on the soil that had once been  our own. I had just married; it was needful to make a great exertion. I  had heard much of the high wages of this new industry; I left the land.\"    \"And the papers?\"    \"I never thought of them, or thought of them with disgust, as the cause  of my ruin. Then when you came the other day, and showed me in the  book that the last abbot of Marney was a Walter Gerard, the old feeling  stirred again; and I could not help telling you that my fathers fought  at Azincourt, though I was only the overlooker at Mr Trafford's mill.\"    \"A good old name of the good old faith,\" said the Religious; \"and a  blessing be on it.\"    \"We have cause to bless it,\" said Gerard. \"I thought it then something  to serve a gentleman; and as for my daughter, she, by their goodness,  was brought up in holy walls, which have made her what she is.\"    \"Nature made her what she is,\" said Stephen in a low voice, and speaking  not without emotion. Then he continued, in a louder and brisker tone,  \"But this Hatton--you know nothing of his whereabouts?\"    \"Never heard of him since. I had indeed about a year after my father's  death, cause to enquire after him; but he had quitted Mowbray, and none  could give me tidings of him. He had lived I believe on our law-suit,  and vanished with our hopes.\"    After this, there was silence; each was occupied with his thoughts,  while the influence of the soft night and starry hour induced to  contemplation.    \"I hear the murmur of the train,\" said the Religious.    \"'Tis the up-train,\" said her father. \"We have yet a quarter of an hour;  we shall be in good time.\"    So saying, he guided the pony to where some lights indicated the station  of the railway, which here crossed the moor. There was just time to  return the pony to the person at the station from whom it had been  borrowed, and obtain their tickets, when the bell of the down-train  sounded, and in a few minutes the Religious and her companions were on  their way to Mowbray, whither a course of two hours carried them.    It was two hours to midnight when they arrived at Mowbray station, which  was about a quarter of a mile from the town. Labour had long ceased; a  beautiful heaven, clear and serene, canopied the city of smoke and toil;  in all directions rose the columns of the factories, dark and defined  in the purple sky; a glittering star sometimes hovering by the crest of  their tall and tapering forms.    The travellers proceeded in the direction of a suburb and approached the  very high wall of an extensive garden. The moon rose as they reached it,  tipped the trees with light, and revealed a lofty and centre portal,  by the side of it a wicket at which Gerard rang. The wicket was quickly  opened.    \"I fear, holy sister,\" said the Religious, \"that I am even later than I  promised.\"    \"Those that come in our lady's name are ever welcome,\" was the reply.    \"Sister Marion,\" said Gerard to the porteress, \"we have been to visit a  holy place.\"    \"All places are holy with holy thoughts, my brother.\"    \"Dear father, good night,\" said the Religious; \"the blessings of all the  saints be on thee,--and on thee, Stephen, though thou dost not kneel to  them.\"    \"Good night, mine own child,\" said Gerard.    \"I could believe in saints when I am with thee,\" murmured Stephen; \"Good  night,--SYBIL.\"          Book 2 Chapter 9        When Gerard and his friend quitted the convent they proceeded at a brisk  pace, into the heart of the town. The streets were nearly empty; and  with the exception of some occasional burst of brawl or merriment from  a beer-shop, all was still. The chief street of Mowbray, called  Castle Street after the ruins of the old baronial stronghold in its  neighbourhood, was as significant of the present civilization of this  community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependence. The  dimensions of Castle Street were not unworthy of the metropolis: it  traversed a great portion of the town, and was proportionately wide; its  broad pavements and its blazing gas-lights indicated its modern order  and prosperity; while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses,  not as beautiful as the palaces of Venice, but in their way not less  remarkable; magnificent shops; and here and there, though rarely, some  ancient factory built among the fields in the infancy of Mowbray by some  mill-owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future, or sufficiently  confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow-citizens, to  foresee that the scene of his labours would be the future eye-sore of a  flourishing posterity.    Pursuing their course along Castle Street for about a quarter of a mile,  Gerard and Stephen turned down a street which intersected it, and so  on, through a variety of ways and winding lanes, till they arrived at an  open portion of the town, a district where streets and squares and even  rows, disappeared, and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack-looking  buildings that rose in all directions, clustering yet isolated,  announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of  Mowbray. Crossing this open ground they gained a suburb, but one of  a very different description to that in which was situate the convent  where they had parted with Sybil. This one was populous, noisy, and  lighted. It was Saturday night; the streets were thronged; an infinite  population kept swarming to and fro the close courts and pestilential  cul-de-sacs that continually communicated with the streets by narrow  archways, like the entrance of hives, so low that you were obliged to  stoop for admission: while ascending to these same streets, from their  dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps the subterraneous  nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer  night, and market for the day of rest. The bright and lively shops were  crowded; and groups of purchasers were gathered round the stalls, that  by the aid of glaring lamps and flaunting lanthorns, displayed their  wares.    \"Come, come, it'"]]]
