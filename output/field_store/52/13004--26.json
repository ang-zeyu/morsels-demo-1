Issues put on each side of the prominent bone are of great effect, I  suppose, by their stimulus; which excites into action more of the sensorial  powers of irritation and sensation, and thus gives greater activity to the  vascular system in their vicinity. The methods recommended in distortion of  the spine are also to be attended to.    19. _Spina bifida._ Divided spine, called also Hydrorachitis, as well as  the Hydrocephalus externus, are probably owing in part to a defect of  ossification of the spine and cranium; and that the collection of fluid  beneath them may originate from the general debility of the system; which  affects both the secerning, and absorbent vessels.    A curious circumstance, which is affirmed to attend the spina bifida, is,  that on compressing the tumor with the hand gently, the whole brain becomes  affected, and the patient falls asleep. I suppose the same must happen on  compressing the hydrocephalus externus? See Sect. XVIII. 20.    20. _Ossis palati defectus._ A defect of the bone of the palate, which  frequently accompanies a division of the upper lip, occurs before nativity;  and is owing to the deficient action of the secerning system, from whence  the extremities are not completed. From a similar cause I have seen the  point of the tongue deficient, and one joint of the two least fingers, and  of the two least toes, in the same infant; who was otherwise a fine girl.  See Sect. XXXIX. 4. 4.    The operation for the hare-lip is described by many surgical writers; but  there is a person in London, who makes very ingenious artificial palates;  which prevents that defect of speech, which attends this malformation. This  factitious palate consists of a thin plate of silver of the shape and form  of the roof of the mouth; from the front edge to the back edge of this  silver plate four or five holes are made in a straight line large enough  for a needle to pass through them; on the back of it is then sewed a piece  of sponge; which when expanded with moisture is nearly as large as the  silver plate. This sponge is slipped through the division of the bone of  the palate, so as to lie above it, while the silver plate covers the  aperture beneath, and is suspended by the expanding sponge. This is removed  every night and washed, and returned into its place in the morning; on this  account it is convenient to have five or six of them, for the sake of  cleanliness. I have been more particular in describing this invention, as I  do not know the name, or place of residence, of the maker.           *       *       *       *       *    ORDO II.    _Decreased Irritation._    GENUS III.    _The Decreased Action of the Absorbent System._    Some decrease of heat attends these diseases, though in a less degree than  those of the last genus, because the absorbent system of glands do not  generate so much heat in their healthy state of action as the secerning  system of glands, as explained in Class I. 1. 3.    SPECIES.    1. _Mucus faucium frigidus._ Cold mucus from the throat. Much mucus, of  rather a saline taste, and less inspissated than usual, is evacuated from  the fauces by hawking, owing to the deficient absorption of the thinner  parts of it. This becomes a habit in some elderly people, who are  continually spitting it out of their mouths; and has probably been brought  on by taking snuff, or smoking tobacco; which by frequently stimulating the  fauces have at length rendered the absorbent vessels less excitable by the  natural stimulus of the saline part of the secretion, which ought to be  reabsorbed, as soon as secreted.    M. M. A few grains of powder of bark frequently put into the mouth, and  gradually diffused over the fauces. A gargle of barley water.    2. _Sudor frigidus._ The cold dampness of the hands of some people is  caused by the deficient absorption of perspirable matter; the clammy or  viscid feel of it is owing to the mucous part being left upon the skin. The  coldness is produced both by the decreased action of the absorbent system,  and by the evaporation of a greater quantity of the perspirable matter into  the air, which ought to have been absorbed.    M. M. Wash the hands in lime water, or with a small quantity of volatile  alcali in water.    3. _Catarrhus frigidus._ The thin discharge from the nostrils in cold  weather. The absorbent vessels become torpid by the diminution of external  heat, sooner than the secerning ones, which are longer kept warm by the  circulating blood, from which they select the fluid they secrete; whereas  the absorbent vessels of the nostrils drink up their fluids, namely the  thin and saline part of the mucus, after it has been cooled by the  atmosphere. Hence the absorbents ceasing to act, and the secerning vessels  continuing some time longer to pour out the mucus, a copious thin discharge  is produced, which trickles down the nostrils in cold weather. This  discharge is so acrid as to inflame the upper lip; which is owing to the  neutral salts, with which it abounds, not being reabsorbed; so the tears in  the fistula lacrymalis inflame the cheek. See Class I. 1. 2. 7.    4. _Expectoratio frigida._ Cold expectoration. Where the pulmonary  absorption is deficient, an habitual cough is produced, and a frequent  expectoration of thin saline mucus; as is often seen in old enfeebled  people. Though the stimulus of the saline fluid, which attends all  secretions, is not sufficient to excite the languid absorbent vessels to  imbibe it; yet this saline part, together with the increased quantity of  the whole of the secreted mucus, stimulates the branches of the bronchia,  so as to induce an almost incessant cough to discharge it from the lungs. A  single grain of opium, or any other stimulant drug, as a wine-posset with  spirit of hartshorn, will cure this cold cough, and the cold catarrh of the  preceding article, like a charm, by stimulating the torpid mouths of the  absorbents into action. Which has given rise to an indiscriminate and  frequently pernicious use of the warm regimen in coughs and catarrhs of the  warm or inflammatory kind, to the great injury of many.    M. M. Half a grain of opium night and morning promotes the absorption of  the more fluid and saline parts, and in consequence thickens the mucus, and  abates its acrimony. Warm diluent drink, wine-whey, with volatile alcali.    5. _Urina uberior pallida._ On being exposed naked to cold air, or  sprinkled with cold water, a quantity of pale urine is soon discharged; for  the absorbents of the bladder become torpid by their sympathy with those of  the skin; which are rendered quiescent by the diminution of external heat;  but the kidnies continue to secrete the urine, and as no part of it is  absorbed, it becomes copious and pale. This happens from a similar cause in  cold fits of agues; and in less degree to many debilitated constitutions,  whose extremities are generally cold and pale. The great quantity of limpid  water in hysteric cases, and in diabaetes, belongs to Class I. 3. 1. 10. I.  3. 2. 6.    M. M. Tincture of cantharides, opium, alum, sorbentia. Flannel shirt in  cold weather. Animal food. Beer. Wine. Friction. Exercise. Fire.    6. _Diarrhoea frigida._ Liquid stools are produced by exposing the body  naked to cold air, or sprinkling it with cold water, for the same reason as  the last article.    But this disease is sometimes of a dangerous nature; the intestinal  absorption being so impaired, that the aliment is said to come away  undiminished in quantity, and almost unchanged by the powers of digestion,  and is then called lientery.    The mucus of the rectum sometimes comes away like pellucid hartshorn jelly,  and liquefies by heat like that, towards the end of inirritative fevers,  which is owing to the thinner part of the mucus not being absorbed, and  thus resembles the catarrh of some old people.    M. M. Opium, campechy wood, armenian bole. Blister. Flannel shirt in cold  weather. Clysters with opium. Friction on the bowels morning and night.  Equitation twice a day.    7. _Fluor albus frigidus._ Cold fluor albus. In weak constitutions, where  this discharge is pellucid and thin, it must proceed from want of  absorption of the mucous membrane of the vagina, or uterus, and not from an  increased secretion. This I suspect to be the most frequent kind of fluor  albus; the former one described at Class I. 1. 2. 11. attends menstruation,  or is a discharge instead of it, and thus resembles the venereal orgasm of  female quadrupeds. The discharge in this latter kind being more saline, is  liable to excoriate the part, and thus produce smarting in making water; in  its great degree it is difficult to cure.    M. M. Increase the evacuation by stool and by perspiration, by taking  rhubarb every night, about six or ten grains with one grain of opium for  some months. Flannel shirt in winter. Balsam copaiva. Gum kino, bitters,  chalybeates, friction over the whole skin with flannel morning and night.  Partial cold bath, by sprinkling the loins and thighs, or sponging them  with cold water. Mucilage, as isinglass boiled in milk; blanc mange,  hartshorn jelly, are recommended by some. Tincture of cantharides sometimes  seems of service given from ten to twenty drops or more, three or four  times a day. A large plaster of burgundy pitch and armenian bole, so as to  cover the loins and lower part of the belly, is said to have sometimes  succeeded by increasing absorption by its compression in the manner of a  bandage. A solution of metallic salts, as white vitriol, sixty grains to a  pint; or an infusion of oak-bark may be injected into the vagina. Cold  bath.    8. _Gonorrhoea frigida._ Cold gleet. Where the gleet is thin and pellucid,  it must arise from the want of absorption of the membranes of the urethra,  rather than from an increased secretion from them. This I suppose to be a  more common disease than that mentioned at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27638"],[0,"The 2001 CIA World Factbook (#19)"],[1," In the  medium term, prospects for the economy will depend on the tourism  sector and, therefore, on continuing income growth in the  industrialized nations as well as favorable weather conditions.

Not until 1838 was it established that Antarctica  was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands. Various  \"firsts\" were achieved in the early 20th century, including: 1902,  first balloon flight (by British explorer Robert Falcon SCOTT);  1912, first to the South Pole (five Norwegian explorers under Roald  AMUNDSEN); 1928, first fixed-wing aircraft flight (by Australian  adventurer/explorer Sir Hubert WILKINS); 1929, first flight over the  South Pole (by Americans Richard BYRD and Bernt BALCHEN); and 1935,  first transantarctic flight (American Lincoln ELLSWORTH). Following  World War II, there was an upsurge in scientific research on the  continent. A number of countries have set up year-round research  stations on Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but no  other country recognizes these claims. In order to form a legal  framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an  Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives  recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959, it  entered into force in 1961.

twenty of 27 Antarctic consultative nations  have made no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia and the  US have reserved the right to do so) and do not recognize the claims  of the other nations; also see the Disputes - international entry    Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and  distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West  Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has  the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January  along the coast and average slightly below freezing    Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,  with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain  ranges up to 5,140 meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of  southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,  and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves  along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves  constitute 11% of the area of the continent    Elevation extremes: lowest point:  Bentley Subglacial Trench -2,540 m    highest point:  Vinson Massif 5,140 m    note:  the lowest known land point in Antarctica is hidden in the  Bentley Subglacial Trench; at its surface is the deepest ice yet  discovered and the world's lowest elevation not under sea water    Natural resources: iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel,  platinum and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been  found in small uncommercial quantities; none presently exploited;  krill, finfish, and crab have been taken by commercial fisheries    Land use: arable land:  0%    permanent crops:  0%    permanent pastures:  0%    forests and woodland:  0%    other:  100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)    Irrigated land: 0 sq km (1993)    Natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward  from the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the  plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise  along the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of  West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak; large  icebergs may calve from ice shelf    Environment - current issues: in 1998, NASA satellite data showed  that the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27  million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased  ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of  icefish, an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion  earlier was shown to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants    Geography - note: the coldest, windiest, highest (on average), and  driest continent; during summer, more solar radiation reaches the  surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an  equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable        Antarctica    People    Population: no indigenous inhabitants, but there are seasonally  staffed research stations    note:  approximately 29 nations, all signatory to the Antarctic  Treaty, send personnel to perform seasonal (summer) and year-round  research on the continent and in its surrounding oceans; the  population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent  and its nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the  region covered by the Antarctic Treaty) varies from approximately  4,000 in summer to 1,000 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000  personnel including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard  research are present in the waters of the treaty region; Summer  (January) population - 3,687 total; Argentina 302, Australia 201,  Belgium 13, Brazil 80, Bulgaria 16, Chile 352, China 70, Finland 11,  France 100, Germany 51, India 60, Italy 106, Japan 136, South Korea  14, Netherlands 10, NZ 60, Norway 40, Peru 28, Poland 70, Russia  254, South Africa 80, Spain 43, Sweden 20, UK 192, US 1,378  (1998-99);
