He'd hang every poacher in the land for  that matter, saying, as I have heard him many a time, that it is much worse  to steal any thing that is unprotected, than if it is protected.\"    With these thoughts he rode straight away to the house of Mr. Dixwell, but  to his mortification he found that the worthy clergyman was out. \"Can you  tell me where he is?\" he asked of the servant, \"I want him on business of  the greatest importance.\"    The woman hesitated for a moment, but the expression of perplexity and  anxiety on the good farmer's face overcame her scruples, and she replied,  \"I did not exactly hear him say where he was going, but I saw him take the  foot-path down to Jenny Best's.\"    Atkinson turned his horse's head at once, and rode along the road till he  reached the cottage. There he fastened his horse to a tree, and went in.  The outer room was vacant; but through the partition he heard a voice  speaking in a slow, measured tone, as if in prayer; and after waiting and  hesitating for a moment or two, he struck upon the table with his knuckles  to call attention to his presence.    The moment after, the door opened slowly and quietly, and Jenny Best  herself first put out her head, and then came into the room with a curtsy,  closing the door behind her.    \"Good day, Jenny,\" said the farmer; \"is Mr. Dixwell here?\"    \"Yes, Master Atkinson,\" replied the good dame; \"he is in there, praying  with a sick person.\"    \"Why how is that?\" asked Mr. Atkinson. \"Best is not ill, I hope, nor your  son.\"    \"No, sir,\" answered the old woman; \"it is a young man who broke his leg  close by our door the other day;\" and seeing him about to ask further  questions, which she might have had difficulty in parrying, she added, \"I  will call the parson, to you, sir.\"    Thus saying, she retreated again into the inner room, and in a few moments  Mr. Dixwell himself appeared.    \"God day, Atkinson,\" he said; \"you have been absent on a journey, I hear.\"    \"Yes, your Reverence,\" replied the farmer, \"and it is in consequence of  that journey that I come to you now. I want a warrant from you, Mr.  Dixwell; and that as quick as possible.\"    \"Why, I cannot give you a warrant here,\" said the clergyman, hesitating. \"I  have no clerk with me, nor any forms of warrants, and I cannot very well go  home just now. It can do no harm waiting an hour or two, I suppose.\"    \"It may do a great deal of harm,\" replied the farmer, \"for as great a rogue  and as bad a fellow as ever lived may escape from justice if it is not  granted immediately.\"    \"Can't you go to Mr. Hastings?\" said the clergyman. \"He would give you one  directly, if the case justifies it.\"    \"He sent me to your Reverence,\" replied the farmer. \"In one word, the case  is this, Mr. Dixwell. I have to charge a man, whom, I suppose, I must call  a gentleman, upon oath, with fraud, perjury, and forgery. Shanks, one of  the conspirators we have got already. But this man--this fellow who calls  himself Sir John Hastings, I mean, is hiding away here--in this very  cottage, sir, I am told--and may make his escape at any minute. Now that I  am here, and a magistrate with me, I tell you fairly, sir, I will not quit  the place till I have him in custody.\"    He spoke in a very sharp and decided tone; for to say the truth he had a  vague suspicion that Mr. Dixwell, whose good-nature was well known, knew  very well where John Ayliffe was, and might be trying to convert him, with  the full intention of afterwards aiding him to escape. The clergyman  answered at once, however, \"he is here, Master Atkinson, but he is very  ill, and will soon be in sterner custody than yours.\"    There was a good deal of the bull-dog spirit of the English yeoman in the  good farmer's character, and he replied tartly, \"I don't care for that. He  shall be in my custody first.\"    Mr. Dixwell looked pained and offended. His brow contracted a good deal,  and laying his hand upon the farmer's wrist, he led him towards the door of  the inner room, saying, \"You are hard and incredulous, sir. But come with  me, and you shall see his state with your own eyes.\"    The farmer suffered himself to be led along, and Mr. Dixwell opened the  door, and entered the room with a quiet and reverent step. The sunshine was  streaming through the little window upon the floor, and by its cheerful  light, contrasting strangely with the gray darkness of the face which lay  upon the bed of death. There was not a sound, but the footfalls of the two  persons who entered; for the old woman had seated herself by the bedside,  and was gazing silently at the face of the sick man.    At first, Mr. Atkinson thought that he was dead; and life indeed lingered  on with but the very faintest spark. He seemed utterly unconscious; for the  eyes even did not move at the sound of the opening door, and the farmer was  a good deal shocked at the hardness of his judgment. He was not one,  however, to give up his purpose easily, and when Mr. Dixwell said, \"you can  now see and judge for yourself--is he likely to escape, do you think?\"  Atkinson answered in a low but determined tone, \"No, but I do not think I  ought to leave him as long as there is any life in him.\"    \"You can do as you please,\" said Mr. Dixwell, in a tone of much  displeasure, \"Only be silent. There is a seat;\" and leaving him, he took  his place again by the dying man's side.    Though shocked, and feeling perhaps a little ashamed, Mr. Atkinson, with  that dogged sort of resolution which I have before spoken of, resisted his  own feelings, and would not give up the field. He thought he was doing his  duty, and that is generally quite sufficient for an Englishman. Nothing  could move him, so long as breath was in the body of the unhappy young man.  He remained seated there, perfectly still and silent, as hour after hour  slipped away, with his head bent down, and his arms crossed upon his chest.    The approach of death was very slow with John Ayliffe: he lingered long  after all the powers of the body seemed extinct. Hand or foot he could not  move--his sunken eyes remained half closed--the hue of death was upon his  face, but yet the chest heaved, the breath came and went, sometimes  rapidly, sometimes very slowly; and for a long time Mr. Dixwell could not  tell whether he was conscious at all or not. At the end of two hours,  however, life seemed to make an effort against the great enemy, though it  was a very feeble one, and intellect had no share in it. He began to mutter  a few words from time to time, but they were wild and incoherent, and the  faint sounds referred to dogs and horses, to wine and money. He seemed to  think himself talking to his servants, gave orders, and asked questions,  and told them to light a fire, he was so cold. This went on till the shades  of evening began to fall, and then Mr. Short, the surgeon, came in and felt  his pulse.    \"It is very strange,\" said the surgeon, \"that this has lasted so long. But  it must be over in a few minutes now. I can hardly feel a pulsation.\"    Mr. Dixwell did not reply, and the surgeon remained gazing on the dying  man's face till it was necessary to ask for a light. Jenny Best brought in  a solitary candle, and whether it was the effect of the sudden though  feeble glare, I cannot tell, John Ayliffe opened his eyes, and said, more  distinctly than before, \"I am going--I am going--this is death--yes, this  is death! Pray for me, Mr. Dixwell--pray for me--I do repent--yes, I have  hope.\"    The jaw quivered a little as he uttered the last words, but at the same  moment John Best, the good woman's husband, entered the room with a hurried  step, drew Mr. Short, the surgeon, aside, and whispered something in his  ear.    \"Good Heaven!\" exclaimed the surgeon. \"Impossible, Best! Has the man got a  horse? mine's at the farm.\"    \"Yes, sir, yes!\" replied the man, eagerly. \"He has got a horse; but you had  better make haste.\"    Mr. Short dashed out of the room; but before he left it, John Ayliffe was a  corpse.      CHAPTER XLV.    Mrs. Hazleton found the inconvenience of having a dear friend. It was in  vain that she tried to get rid of her visitor. The visitor would not be got  rid of. She was deaf to hints; she paid no attention to any kind of  inuendoes; and she looked so knowing, so full of important secrets, so  quietly mischievous, that Mrs. Hazleton was cowed by that most unnerving of  all things, the consciousness of meditated crime. She could not help  thinking that the fair widow saw into her thoughts and purposes--she could  not help doubting the impenetrability of the veil behind which hypocrisy  hides the hideous features of unruly passion--she could not help thinking  that the keen-sighted and astute must perceive some of the movements at  least of the rude movers of the painted puppets of the face--the smile, the  gay looks, the sparkling eyes, the calm placid brow, the dignified  serenity, which act their part in the glittering scene of the world, too  often worked by the most harsh, foul, and brutal of all the motives of the  human heart. But she was irritated too, as well as fearful; and there was a  sort of combat went on between impatience and apprehension. Had she given  way to inclination she would have ordered one of her servants to take the  intruder by the shoulders and put her out of doors; but for more than an  hour after the time she had fixed for setting out, vague fears--however  groundless and absurd--were sufficiently powerful to restrain her temper.  She was not of a character, however, to be long cowed by any thing. She had  great confidence in herself--in her own resources--in her own conduct and  good fortune likewise. That confidence might have been a little shaken  indeed by events which had lately occurred; but anger soon rallied it, and  brought it back to her aid. She asked herself if she were a fool to dread  that woman--what it was she had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3657"],[0,"Wild Beasts and Their Ways, Reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America — (#19)"],[1,"ded. The golden image has been scratched,  and the potter's clay beneath has been revealed. This is a terrible  result of clumsy management. We have failed in every way. Broken faith  has dissipated our character for sincerity, and our military operations  have failed to attain their object, resulting in retreat upon every  side, to be followed up even to the seashores of the Red Sea by an enemy  that is within range of our gun-vessels at Souakim. This is a  distressing change to those who have received much kindness and passed  most agreeable days among the Arab tribes of the Soudan deserts, and I  look back with intense regret to the errors we have committed, by which  the entire confidence has been destroyed which formerly was associated  with the English name. The countries which we opened by many years of  hard work and patient toil throughout the Soudan, even through the  extreme course of the White Nile to its birthplace in the equatorial  regions, have been abandoned by the despotic order of the British  Government, influenced by panic instead of policy; telegraphic lines  which had been established in the hitherto barbarous countries of  Kordofan, Darfur, the Blue Nile territories of Senaar, and throughout  the wildest deserts of Nubia to Khartoum have all been abandoned to the  rebels, who under proper management should have become England's  friends.    This has been our civilising influence (?), by which we have broken down  the work of half a century, and produced the most complete anarchy where  five-and-twenty years ago a lady could travel in security. England  entered Egypt in arms to _re-establish the authority of the Khedive!_ We  have dislocated his Empire, and forsaken the Soudan.        CHAPTER IV    The experience of modern practice has hardly decided the vexed question  \"whether the African species is more difficult to train than the gentle  elephant of Asia.\" In a wild state there can be no doubt that the  African is altogether a different animal both in appearance and in  habits; it is vastly superior in size, and although of enormous bulk, it  is more active and possesses greater speed than the Asiatic variety. Not  only is the marked difference in shape a distinguishing peculiarity,--the  hollow back, the receding front, the great size of the ears,--but the  skin is rougher, and more decided in the bark-like appearance of its  texture.    The period of gestation is considered to be the same as the Asiatic  elephant, about twenty-two months, but this must be merely conjecture,  as there has hitherto been no actual proof. My own experience induces me  to believe that the African elephant is more savage, and although it may  be tamed and rendered docile, it is not so dependable as the Asiatic.  Only last year I saw an African female in a menagerie who had killed her  keeper, and was known to be most treacherous. Her attendant informed me  that she was particularly fond of change, and would welcome a new keeper  with evident signs of satisfaction, but after three or four days she  would tire of his society and would assuredly attempt to injure him,  either by backing and squeezing him against the wall, or by kicking  should he be within reach of her hind legs.    Few persons are aware of the extreme quickness with which an elephant  can kick, and the great height that can be reached by this mischievous  use of the hind foot. I have frequently seen an elephant kick as sharp  as a small pony, and the effect of a blow from so ponderous a mass  propelled with extreme velocity may be imagined. This is a peculiar  action, as the elephant is devoid of hocks, and it uses the knees of the  hind legs in a similar manner to those of a human being, therefore a  backward kick would seem unnatural; but the elephant can kick both  backwards and forwards with equal dexterity, and this constitutes a  special means of defence against an enemy, which seldom escapes when  exposed to such a game between the fore and hind feet of the infuriated  animal.    Although it is generally believed that an elephant moves the legs upon  each side simultaneously, like the camel, it does not actually touch the  ground with each foot upon the same side at exactly the same moment, but  the fore foot touches the surface first, rapidly followed by the hind,  and in both cases the heel is the first portion of the foot that reaches  its destination. The effect may be seen in the feet of an elephant after  some months' continual marching upon hard ground: the heels are worn  thin and are quite polished, as though they had been worn down by the  friction of sand-paper,-in fact, they are in the same condition as the  heels of an old boot.    The Indian native princes do not admire the African elephant, as it  combines many points which are objectionable to their peculiar ideas of  elephantine proportions. According to their views, the hollow back of an  African elephant would amount to a deformity. The first time that I ever  saw a large male of that variety I was of the same opinion. I was  hunting with the Hamran Arabs in a wild and uninhabited portion of  Abyssinia, along the banks of the Settite river, which is the main  stream of the Atbara, the chief affluent of the Nile.    As before stated, I have already published an account of these wonderful  hunters in the Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia, and it is sufficient to  describe them as the most fearless and active followers of the chase,  armed with no other weapon than the long, straight, two-edged Arab  sword, with which they attack all animals, from the elephant and  rhinoceros to the lion and buffalo. The sword is sharpened to the finest  degree, and the blade is protected for about six inches above the  cross-hilt with thick string, bound tightly round so as to afford a grip  for the right hand, while the left grips the hilt in the usual manner.  This converts the ordinary blade into a two-handed sword, a blow from  which will sever a naked man into two halves if delivered at the waist.  It may be imagined that a quick cut from such a formidable weapon will  at once divide the hamstring of any animal. The usual method of  attacking the elephant is as follows:-Three, or at the most four mounted  hunters sally forth in quest of game. When the fresh tracks of elephants  are discovered they are steadily followed up until the herd, or perhaps  the single animal, is found. If a large male with valuable tusks, it is  singled out and separated from the herd. The leading hunter follows the  retreating elephant, accompanied by his companions in single file. After  a close hunt, keeping within 10 yards of the game, a sudden halt becomes  necessary, as the elephant turns quickly round and faces its pursuers.    The greatest coolness is required, as the animal, now thoroughly roused,  is prepared to charge. The hunters separate to right and left, leaving  the leader to face the elephant. After a few moments, during which the  hunter insults the animal by shouting uncomplimentary remarks concerning  the antecedents of its mother, and various personal allusions to  imaginary members of the family, the elephant commences to back a  half-dozen paces as a preliminary to a desperate onset. This is the  well-known sign of the coming charge. A sharp shrill trumpet! and, with  its enormous ears thrown forward, the great bull elephant rushes towards  the apparently doomed horse. As quick as lightning the horse is turned,  and a race commences along a course terribly in favour of the elephant,  where deep ruts, thick tangled bush, and the branches of opposing trees  obstruct both horse and rider. Everything now depends upon the  sure-footedness of the horse and the cool dexterity of the rider. For  the first 100 yards an elephant will follow at 20 miles an hour, which  keeps the horse flying at top speed before it. The rider, even in this  moment of great danger, looks behind him, and adapts his horse's pace so  narrowly to that of his pursuer that the elephant's attention is wholly  absorbed by the hope of overtaking the unhappy victim.    In the meantime, two hunters follow the elephant at full gallop; one  seizes his companion's reins and secures the horse, while the rider  springs to the ground with the same agility as a trained circus-rider,  and with one dexterous blow of his flashing sword he divides the back  sinew of the elephant's hind leg about 16 inches above the heel. The  sword cuts to the bone. The elephant that was thundering forward at a  headlong speed suddenly halts; the foot dislocates when the great weight  of the animal presses upon it deprived of the supporting sinew. That one  cut of the sharp blade, disables an animal which appeared invincible.    As the elephant moves both legs upon the same side simultaneously, the  disabling of one leg entirely cripples all progress, and the creature  becomes absolutely helpless. The hunter, having delivered his fatal  stroke, springs nimbly upon one side to watch the effect, and then  without difficulty he slashes the back sinew of the remaining leg, with  the result that the animal bleeds to death. This is a cruel method, but  it requires the utmost dexterity and daring on the part of the hunters,  most of whom eventually fall victims to their gallantry.    I was accompanied by these splendid sword-hunters of the Hamran Arabs in  1861 during my exploration of the Nile tributaries of Abyssinia; and  upon the first occasion that I was introduced to an African male  elephant, the animal was standing at the point of a long sandbank which  had during high water formed the bed of the river, where a sudden bend  had hollowed out the inner side of the curve and thrown up a vast mass  of sand upon the opposite shore. This bank was a succession of terraces,  each about 4 feet high, formed at intervals during the changes in the  level of the retreating stream. The elephant was standing partly in the  water drinking, and quite 100 yards from "]]]
