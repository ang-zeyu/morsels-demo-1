He then got off,  unsaddled and picketed his horse, and in his blanket quickly went to  sleep.    At the first streak of dawn he was up, and within a short half-mile,  thanks to the snowy mare, he found the band. At his approach, the shrill  neigh of the Pacer bugled his troop into a flying squad. But on the  first mesa they stopped, and faced about to see what this persistent  follower was, and what he wanted. For a moment or so they stood against  the sky to gaze, and then deciding that he knew him as well as he wished  to, that black meteor flung his mane on the wind, and led off at his  tireless, even swing, while the mares came streaming after.    Away they went, circling now to the west, and after several repetitions  of this same play, flying, following, and overtaking, and flying again,  they passed, near noon, the old Apache look-out, Buffalo Bluff. And  here, on watch, was Jo. A long thin column of smoke told Charley to come  to camp, and with a flashing pocket-mirror he made response. Jo, freshly  mounted, rode across, and again took up the chase, and back came Charley  to camp to eat and rest, and then move on up stream.    All that day Jo followed, and managed, when it was needed, that the herd  should keep the great circle, of which the wagon cut a small chord. At  sundown he came to Verde Crossing, and there was Charley with a fresh  horse and food, and Jo went on in the same calm, dogged way. All the  evening he followed, and far into the night, for the wild herd was now  getting somewhat used to the presence of the harmless strangers, and  were more easily followed; moreover, they were tiring out with perpetual  traveling. They were no longer in the good grass country, they were not  grain-fed like the horses on their track, and above all, the slight  but continuous nervous tension was surely telling. It spoiled their  appetites, but made them very thirsty. They were allowed, and as far  as possible encouraged, to drink deeply at every chance. The effect of  large quantities of water on a running animal is well known; it tends to  stiffen the limbs and spoil the wind. Jo carefully guarded his own horse  against such excess, and both he and his horse were fresh when they  camped that night on the trail of the jaded mustangs.    At dawn he found them easily close at hand, and though they ran at first  they did not go far before they dropped into a walk. The battle seemed  nearly won now, for the chief difficulty in the 'walk-down' is to keep  track of the herd the first two or three days when they are fresh.    All that morning Jo kept in sight, generally in close sight, of the  band. About ten o'clock, Charley relieved him near Jos. Peak and that  day the mustangs walked only a quarter of a mile ahead with much less  spirit than the day before and circled now more north again. At night  Charley was supplied with a fresh horse and followed as before.    Next day the mustangs walked with heads held low, and in spite of the  efforts of the Black Pacer at times they were less than a hundred yards  ahead of their pursuer.    The fourth and fifth days passed the same way, and now the herd was  nearly back to Antelope Springs. So far all had come out as expected.  The chase had been in a great circle with the wagon following a lesser  circle. The wild herd was back to its starting-point, worn out; and the  hunters were back, fresh and on fresh horses. The herd was kept from  drinking till late in the afternoon and then driven to the Springs to  swell themselves with a perfect water gorge. Now was the chance for the  skilful ropers on the grain-fed horses to close in, for the sudden heavy  drink was ruination, almost paralysis, of wind and limb, and it would be  easy to rope and hobble them one by one.    There was only one weak spot in the programme, the Black Stallion, the  cause of the hunt, seemed made of iron, that ceaseless swinging pace  seemed as swift and vigorous now as on the morning when the chase began.  Up and down he went rounding up the herd and urging them on by voice and  example to escape. But they were played out. The old white mare that  had been such help in sighting them at night, had dropped out hours ago,  dead beat. The half-bloods seemed to be losing all fear of the horsemen,  the band was clearly in Jo's power. But the one who was the prize of all  the hunt seemed just as far as ever out of reach.    Here was a puzzle. Jo's comrades knew him well and would not have been  surprised to see him in a sudden rage attempt to shoot the Stallion  down. But Jo had no such mind. During that long week of following he  had watched the horse all day at speed and never once had he seen him  gallop.    The horseman's adoration of a noble horse had grown and grown, till now  he would as soon have thought of shooting his best mount as firing on  that splendid beast.    Jo even asked himself whether he would take the handsome sum that was  offered for the prize. Such an animal would be a fortune in himself to  sire a race of pacers for the track.    But the prize was still at large--the time had come to finish up the  hunt. Jo's finest mount was caught. She was a mare of Eastern blood, but  raised on the plains. She never would have come into Jo's possession but  for a curious weakness. The loco is a poisonous weed that grows in these  regions. Most stock will not touch it; but sometimes an animal tries it  and becomes addicted to it.    It acts somewhat like morphine, but the animal, though sane for long  intervals, has always a passion for the herb and finally dies mad. A  beast with the craze is said to be locoed. And Jo's best mount had a  wild gleam in her eye that to an expert told the tale.    But she was swift and strong and Jo chose her for the grand finish of  the chase. It would have been an easy matter now to rope the mares, but  was no longer necessary. They could be separated from their black leader  and driven home to the corral. But that leader still had the look of  untamed strength. Jo, rejoicing in a worthy foe, went bounding forth to  try the odds. The lasso was flung on the ground and trailed to take out  every kink, and gathered as he rode into neatest coils across his left  palm. Then putting on the spur the first time in that chase he rode  straight for the Stallion a quarter of a mile beyond. Away he went, and  away went Jo, each at his best, while the fagged-out mares scattered  right and left and let them pass. Straight across the open plain the  fresh horse went at its hardest gallop, and the Stallion, leading off,  still kept his start and kept his famous swing.    It was incredible, and Jo put on more spur and shouted to his horse,  which fairly flew, but shortened up the space between by not a single  inch. For the Black One whirled across the flat and up and passed a  soap-weed mesa and down across a sandy treacherous plain, then over a  grassy stretch where prairie dogs barked, then hid below, and on came  Jo, but there to see, could he believe his eyes, the Stallion's start  grown longer still, and Jo began to curse his luck, and urge and spur  his horse until the poor uncertain brute got into such a state of  nervous fright, her eyes began to roll, she wildly shook her head from  side to side, no longer picked her ground--a badger-hole received her  foot and down she went, and Jo went flying to the earth. Though badly  bruised, he gained his feet and tried to mount his crazy beast. But she,  poor brute, was done for--her off fore-leg hung loose.    There was but one thing to do. Jo loosed the cinch, put Lightfoot out of  pain, and carried back the saddle to the camp. While the Pacer steamed  away till lost to view.    This was not quite defeat, for all the mares were manageable now, and Jo  and Charley drove them carefully to the 'L cross F' corral and claimed a  good reward. But Jo was more than ever bound to own the Stallion. He had  seen what stuff he was made of, he prized him more and more, and only  sought to strike some better plan to catch him.    IV    The cook on that trip was Bates--Mr. Thomas Bates, he called himself at  the post-office where he regularly went for the letters and remittance  which never came. Old Tom Turkeytrack, the boys called him, from  his cattle-brand, which he said was on record at Denver, and which,  according to his story, was also borne by countless beef and saddle  stock on the plains of the unknown North.    When asked to join the trip as a partner, Bates made some sarcastic  remarks about horses not fetching $12 a dozen, which had been literally  true within the year, and he preferred to go on a very meagre salary.  But no one who once saw the Pacer going had failed to catch the craze.  Turkeytrack experienced the usual change of heart. He now wanted to own  that mustang. How this was to be brought about he did not clearly see  till one day there called at the ranch that had 'secured his services,'  as he put it, one, Bill Smith, more usually known as Horseshoe Billy,  from his cattle-brand. While the excellent fresh beef and bread and the  vile coffee, dried peaches and molasses were being consumed, he of the  horseshoe remarked, in tones which percolated through a huge stop-gap of  bread:    \"Wall, I seen that thar Pacer to-day, nigh enough to put a plait in his  tail.\"    \"What, you didn't shoot?\"    \"No, but I come mighty near it.\"    \"Don't you be led into no sich foolishness,\" said a 'double-bar H'  cow-puncher at the other end of the table. \"I calc'late that maverick  'ill carry my brand before the moon changes.\"    \"You'll have to be pretty spry or you'll find a 'triangle dot' on his  weather side when you get there.\"    \"Where did you run across him?\"    \"Wail, it was like this; I was riding the flat by Antelope Springs and  I sees a lump on the dry mud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30310"],[0,"Special Report on Diseases of Cattle (#19)"],[1," hydrocyanic acid is produced,  and when these leaves are eaten in any considerable quantity cases of  poisoning are likely to arise. It is popularly supposed that these cases  arise from eating wilted cherry leaves, but there is every reason to think  that the fresh leaves will produce the same results. These cases are easily  prevented, because no harm results from eating a small quantity of the  leaves, and if the fact is recognized that poisoning may result from eating  a large quantity, it is not difficult to care for the animals so as to  prevent poisoning.      ERGOTISM.    The poisonous effects of ergot (Pls. V, VI) appear chiefly in the winter  and spring of the year and among cattle. It is developed among grasses  grown on rich soil in hot, damp seasons. Rye seems more liable to ergot  than any of our other crops. Of the grasses which enter into the  composition of hay, bluegrass is the most likely to become affected. Ergot  may also affect redtop, oats, grasses, and grains. On the plant the fungus  manifests itself on the seeds, where it is easily recognized when the hay  is examined in the mow. The ergotized seeds are several times larger than  the natural seeds--hard, black, and generally curved in shape.    The effect of the protracted use of ergot in the feed is pretty well  understood to be that of producing a degeneration and obstruction of the  smaller arterial branches. The result is to shut off the blood supply to  the distal parts of the body, where the circulation is weakest, and thus to  produce a mummification or dry gangrene of the extremities, as the ears,  tail, feet, etc. Cattle seem to be more susceptible than other animals to  the influence of ergot, possibly on account of the slowness of the heart's  action. When the effect of the poison has become sufficient to entirely  arrest the circulation in any part, the structures soon die. The disorder  manifests itself as lameness in one or more limbs; swelling about the ankle  which may result in only a small slough or the loss of a toe, but it may  circumscribe the limb at any point below the knee or hock by an indented  ring below which the tissues become dead. The indentation soon changes to a  crack, which extends completely around the limb, forming the line of  separation between the dead and living structures. The crack deepens till  the parts below drop off without loss of blood, and frequently with very  little pus. Ergot may cause serious irritation of the digestive tract, or  by acting upon the nervous system it may cause lethargy or paralysis. It  also operates to cause contraction of the uterus, and may thus cause  abortion.    _Treatment._--Regarding the treatment, change of feed and local antiseptics  are, of course, indicated. The former may be useful as a preventive, but  when the symptoms have appeared the animal is necessarily so completely  saturated that recovery is likely to be tedious. Tannin may be given  internally in doses of one-half dram twice daily for a few days to  neutralize the unabsorbed alkaloids of the ergot. At the same time give  castor oil. To dilate the blood vessels give chloral hydrate. Bathe the  affected parts with hot water. If sloughing has gone far, amputation must  be resorted to.      OTHER POISONOUS FUNGI.    Many other fungi poison herbivora. In some instances, however, where fungi  are blamed for causing disease their presence on the feedstuff or herbage  is but coincidental with some other and more potent disease-producing  factor. For example, if the conditions are favorable to the growth of fungi  they are also favorable to the growth of bacteria, and bacteria may produce  poisons in feeds. In general it may be said that any feed that is moldy,  musty, or putrid is possibly dangerous. Silage, properly cured, does not  belong to this class, because the curing of silage is not a bacterial  process. But spoiled silage and silage matted with mold is dangerous and  should not be fed.      POISONING BY ANIMAL PRODUCTS.    SNAKE BITES.    The poison contained in the tooth glands of certain venomous reptiles,  particularly some of the snakes, which is injected into or under the skin  of an animal bitten by the reptile, is a very powerful agent. It is likely  to produce a serious local irritation, and in the case of the more  poisonous snakes serious constitutional disturbances, even to causing  death, which it may do in either of two ways: First, when very strong, by  exerting a narcotic influence similar to that of some of the powerful  poisons, checking heart action. Second, by diffused inflammation of the  areolar tissue, gangrene, and extensive sloughing.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms of snake bite are a local swelling caused by an  intense local inflammation, pricks showing where the fangs penetrated,  depression, weakness, feeble pulse, difficult breathing, bluish  discoloration of the visible mucous membranes, stupor, or convulsions. If  the poison is not powerful or plentiful enough to produce death, it is, at  any rate, likely to cause severe local abscesses or sloughs.    _Treatment._--The treatment may be divided into local and general. Locally  every effort should be made to prevent absorption of the poison. If  discovered at once the bitten part had better be excised. If that is  impracticable and a ligature can be applied, as in the case of a bite to  one of the limbs, no time should be lost in applying it above the injury.  It should be made sufficiently tight to so far as possible arrest  circulation in the bitten part. The wound should be freely incised, so that  it will bleed freely, and the poison should be extracted by cupping, or  pressed out by squeezing with the fingers. Permanganate of potassium in 5  per cent solution should be applied to and injected into the wound. The  depressing effect of the poison on the general system should be  counteracted by hypodermic injections of strychnin, or by liberal drenching  with stimulants, such as coffee, digitalis, or the aromatic spirits or  carbonate of ammonia. In animal practice the alcoholic stimulants and local  treatment above described are likely to meet with best success. A special  antitoxin for use in treating snake bite is now prepared and may be had  from the leading druggists. It is quite effective if used promptly.      WASP AND BEE STINGS.    Wasps and bees secrete a poisonous substance which they are able to insert  through the skin of an animal by the aid of their sharp stings. This poison  is a severe local irritant and may even cause local gangrene. It also has a  depressing effect upon the central nervous system and destroys the  red-blood corpuscles. To produce these general effects it must be  introduced in very large quantities, as when an animal is stung by a swarm  of bees or wasps.    _Treatment._--The treatment is to wash the parts with diluted ammonia or  permanganate of potassium solution and to give stimulants internally. If  there is so much swelling about the head and nostrils as to interfere with  breathing, tracheotomy may be necessary.      POISONING WITH SPANISH FLY.    Spanish fly, in the form of powdered cantharides, may be given in an  overdose, or when applied as a blister to too large a surface of skin  enough may be absorbed to poison. If given by the mouth, it causes severe  irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, shown by salivation, sore throat,  colic, bloody diarrhea, etc. It also produces, whether given by the mouth  or absorbed through the skin, irritation of the urinary tract, as shown by  frequent and painful urination. If death results, it is due to respiratory  paralysis.    _Treatment._--Give protectives and the white of egg, with opium. Do not  give oils or alcohol.          DISEASES OF THE HEART, BLOOD VESSELS, AND  LYMPHATICS.    By W. H. HARBAUGH, V. S.    [Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]      THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.    In cattle, as in human beings, the heart, blood vessels, and lymphatics may  be described as the circulatory apparatus.    The heart is in the thoracic cavity (chest). It is conical in form, with  the base or large part uppermost, while the apex, or point, rests just  above the sternum (breastbone). It is situated between the right and left  lungs, the apex inclining to the left, and owing to this the heart beats  are best felt on the left side of the chest, behind the elbow. The heart  may be considered as a hollow muscle, containing four compartments, two on  each side. The upper compartments are called auricles and the lower ones  ventricles. The right auricle and ventricle are completely separated from  the left auricle and ventricle by a thick septum or wall, so that there is  no communication between the right and left sides of the organ.    At the bottom of each auricle is the auriculo-ventricular opening, each  provided with a valve to close it when the heart contracts to force the  blood into the arteries. In the interval between the contractions these  valves hang down into the ventricles.    The muscular tissue of the heart belongs to that class known as  involuntary, because its action is not controlled by the will.    The cavities of the heart are lined by a serous membrane, called the  endocardium, which may be considered as a continuation of the veins and the  arteries, forming their internal lining. The walls of the ventricles are  thicker than those of the auricles, and the walls of the left ventricle are  much thicker than those of the right.    The heart is enveloped by a fibrous sac (or bag), called the pericardium,  which assumes much of the general shape of the outer surface of the heart.    The action of the heart is similar to that of a pump and its function is to  keep the blood in circulation. The auricles may be considered as the  reservoirs or receivers of the blood and the ventricles as the pump  chambers. During the interval between contractions, the heart being in  momentary repose, the blood pours into the "]]]
