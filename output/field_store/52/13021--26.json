Precisely  similar evidence comes from South America. In this case our best  authority is almost beyond suspicion. He knew the native languages well,  being himself a half-caste. He was learned in the European learning  of his time; and as a son of the Incas, he had access to all surviving  Peruvian stores of knowledge, and could collect without difficulty the  testimonies of his countrymen. It will be seen(2) that Don Garcilasso  de la Vega could estimate evidence, and ridiculed the rough methods and  fallacious guesses of Spanish inquirers. Garcilasso de la Vega was  born about 1540, being the son of an Inca princess and of a Spanish  conqueror. His book, Commentarias Reales,(3) was expressly intended to  rectify the errors of such Spanish writers as Acosta. In his account of  Peruvian religion, Garcilasso distinguishes between the beliefs of the  tribes previous to the rise of the Inca empire and the sun-worship of  the Incas. But it is plain, from Garcilasso's own account and from other  evidence, that under the Incas the older faiths and fetichisms survived,  in subordination to sun-worship, just as Pagan superstitions survived  in custom and folk-lore after the official recognition of Christianity.  Sun-worship, in Peru, and the belief in a Supreme Creator there, seem  even, like Catholicism in Mexico, China and elsewhere, to have made a  kind of compromise with the lower beliefs, and to have been content  to allow a certain amount of bowing down in the temples of the elder  faiths. According, then, to Garcilasso's account of Peruvian totemism,  \"An Indian was not looked upon as honourable unless he was descended  from a fountain, river,(4) or lake, or even from the sea, OR FROM A WILD  ANIMAL, such as a bear, lion, tiger, eagle, or the bird they call cuntur  (condor), or some other bird of prey \".(5) A certain amount of worship  was connected with this belief in kinship with beasts and natural  objects. Men offered up to their totems \"what they usually saw them  eat\".(6) On the seacoasts \"they worshipped sardines, skates, dog-fish,  and, for want of larger gods, crabs.... There was not an animal, how  vile and filthy soever, that they did not worship as a god,\" including  \"lizards, toads and frogs.\" Garcilasso (who says they ate the fish  they worshipped) gives his own theory of the origin of totemism. In the  beginning men had only sought for badges whereby to discriminate one  human stock from another. \"The one desired to have a god different from  the other.... They only thought of making one different from another.\"  When the Inca emperors began to civilise the totemistic stocks, they  pointed out that their own father, the sun, possessed \"splendour and  beauty\" as contrasted with \"the ugliness and filth of the frogs and  other vermin they looked upon as gods\".(7) Garcilasso, of course, does  not use the North American word totem (or ote or otem) for the family  badge which represented the family ancestors. He calls these things, as  a general rule, pacarissa. The sun was the pacarissa of the Incas, as it  was of the chief of the Natchez. The pacarissa of other stocks was  the lion, bear, frog, or what not. Garcilasso accounts for the belief  accorded to the Incas, when they claimed actual descent from the sun, by  observing(8) that \"there were tribes among their subjects who professed  similar fabulous descents, though they did not comprehend how to select  ancestors so well as the Incas, but adored animals and other low and  earthly objects\". As to the fact of the Peruvian worship of beasts, if  more evidence is wanted, it is given, among others, by Cieza de Leon,(9)  who contrasts the adoration of the Roman gods with that offered in Peru  to brutes. \"In the important temple of Pacha-camac (the spiritual deity  of Peru) they worshipped a she-fox or vixen and an emerald.\" The devil  also \"appeared to them and spoke in the form of a tiger, very fierce\".  Other examples of totemism in South America may be studied in the  tribes on the Amazon.(10) Mr. Wallace found the Pineapple stock, the  Mosquitoes, Woodpeckers, Herons, and other totem kindreds. A curious  example of similar ideas is discovered among the Bonis of Guiana. These  people were originally West Coast Africans imported as slaves, who have  won their freedom with the sword. While they retain a rough belief in  Gadou (God) and Didibi (the devil), they are divided into totem stocks  with animal names. The red ape, turtle and cayman are among the chief  totems.(11)      (1) Kip, ii. 288.    (2) Appendix B.    (3) See translation in Hakluyt Society's Collection.    (4) Like many Greek heroes.

After this hasty examination of the confused belief in kinship with  animals and other natural objects which underlies institutions in  Australia, West and South Africa, North and South America, we may glance  at similar notions among the non-Aryan races of India. In Dalton's  Ethnology of Bengal,(1) he tells us that the Garo clans are divided into  maharis or motherhoods. Children belong to the mahari of the mother,  just as (in general) they derive their stock name and totem from the  mother's side in Australia and among the North American Indians. No man  may marry (as among the Red Indians and Australians) a woman belonging  to his own stock, motherhood or mahari. So far the maharis of Bengal  exactly correspond to the totem kindred. But do the Maharis also take  their names from plants and animals, and so forth? We know that the  Killis, similar communities among the Bengal Hos and Mundos, do this.(2)  \"The Mundaris, like the Oraons, adopt as their tribal distinction the  name of some animal, and the flesh of that animal is tabooed to them as  food; for example, the eel, the tortoise.\" This is exactly the state of  things in Ashanti. Dalton mentions also(3) a princely family in Nagpur  which claims descent from \"a great hooded snake\". Among the Oraons he  found(4) tribes which might not eat young mice (considered a dainty) or  tortoises, and a stock which might not eat the oil of the tree which  was their totem, nor even sit in its shade. \"The family or tribal names\"  (within which they may not marry) \"are usually those of animals or  plants, and when this is the case, the flesh of some part of the animal  or the fruit of the tree is tabooed to the tribe called after it.\"      (1) Dalton, p. 63.    (2) Ibid., p. 189.    (3) Ibid., p. 166.    (4) Ibid., p. 254.      An excellent sketch of totemism in India is given by Mr. H. H. Risley of  the Bengal Civil Service:--(1)      (1) The Asiatic Quarterly, No. 3, Essay on \"Primitive Marriage in  Bengal.\"      \"At the bottom of the social system, as understood by the average Hindu,  stands a large body of non-Aryan castes and tribes, each of which is  broken up into a number of what may be called totemistic exogamous  septs. Each sept bears the name of an animal, a tree, a plant, or of  some material object, natural or artificial, which the members of that  sept are prohibited from killing, eating, cutting, burning, carrying,  using, etc.\"(1)      (1) Here we may note that the origin of exogamy itself is merely part  of a strict totemistic prohibition. A man may not \"use\" an object within  the totem kin, nor a woman of the kin. Compare the Greek idiom (Greek  text omitted).      Mr. Risley finds that both Kolarians, as the Sonthals, and Dravidians,  as the Oraons, are in this state of totemism, like the Hos and Mundas.  It is most instructive to learn that, as one of these tribes rises in  the social scale, it sloughs off its totem, and, abandoning the common  name derived from bird, beast, or plant, adopts that of an eponymous  ancestor. A tendency in this direction has been observed by Messrs.  Fison and Howitt even in Australia. The Mahilis, Koras and Kurmis,  who profess to be members of the Hindu community, still retain the  totemistic organisation, with names derived from birds, beasts and  plants. Even the Jagannathi Kumhars of Orissa, taking rank immediately  below the writer-caste, have the totems tiger, snake, weasel, cow, frog,  sparrow and tortoise. The sub-castes of the Khatlya Kumhars explain away  their totem-names \"as names of certain saints, who, being present at  Daksha's Horse-sacrifice, transformed themselves into animals to escape  the wrath of Siva,\" like the gods of Egypt when they fled in bestial  form from the wrath of Set.    Among the non-Aryan tribes the marriage law has the totemistic sanction.  No man may marry a woman of his totem kin. When the totem-name is  changed for an eponym, the non-Aryan, rising in the social scale,  is practically in the same position as the Brahmans, \"divided into  exogamous sections (gotras), the members of which profess to be  descended from the mythical rishi or inspired saint whose name the gotra  bears\". There is thus nothing to bar the conjecture that the exogamous  gotras of the whole Brahmans were once a form of totem-kindred,  which (like aspiring non-Aryan stocks at the present day) dropped the  totem-name and renamed the septs from some eponymous hero, medicine-man,  or Rishi.    Constant repetition of the same set of facts becomes irksome, and yet  is made necessary by the legitimate demand for trustworthy and abundant  evidence. As the reader must already have reflected, this living  mythical belief in the common confused equality of men, gods, plants,  beasts, rivers, and what not, which still regulates savage society,(1)  is one of the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"and, though married but the other day, had already five  children. This information and much more Lord Warburton imparted to his  young American listener, taking pains to make many things clear and to  lay bare to her apprehension the peculiarities of English life. Isabel  was often amused at his explicitness and at the small allowance he  seemed to make either for her own experience or for her imagination. \"He  thinks I'm a barbarian,\" she said, \"and that I've never seen forks and  spoons;\" and she used to ask him artless questions for the pleasure of  hearing him answer seriously. Then when he had fallen into the trap,  \"It's a pity you can't see me in my war-paint and feathers,\" she  remarked; \"if I had known how kind you are to the poor savages I would  have brought over my native costume!\" Lord Warburton had travelled  through the United States and knew much more about them than Isabel; he  was so good as to say that America was the most charming country in the  world, but his recollections of it appeared to encourage the idea that  Americans in England would need to have a great many things explained  to them. \"If I had only had you to explain things to me in America!\"  he said. \"I was rather puzzled in your country; in fact I was quite  bewildered, and the trouble was that the explanations only puzzled me  more. You know I think they often gave me the wrong ones on purpose;  they're rather clever about that over there. But when I explain you  can trust me; about what I tell you there's no mistake.\" There was no  mistake at least about his being very intelligent and cultivated and  knowing almost everything in the world. Although he gave the most  interesting and thrilling glimpses Isabel felt he never did it to  exhibit himself, and though he had had rare chances and had tumbled in,  as she put it, for high prizes, he was as far as possible from making  a merit of it. He had enjoyed the best things of life, but they had not  spoiled his sense of proportion. His quality was a mixture of the effect  of rich experience--oh, so easily come by!--with a modesty at times  almost boyish; the sweet and wholesome savour of which--it was as  agreeable as something tasted--lost nothing from the addition of a tone  of responsible kindness.    \"I like your specimen English gentleman very much,\" Isabel said to Ralph  after Lord Warburton had gone.    \"I like him too--I love him well,\" Ralph returned. \"But I pity him  more.\"    Isabel looked at him askance. \"Why, that seems to me his only  fault--that one can't pity him a little. He appears to have everything,  to know everything, to be everything.\"    \"Oh, he's in a bad way!\" Ralph insisted.    \"I suppose you don't mean in health?\"    \"No, as to that he's detestably sound. What I mean is that he's a man  with a great position who's playing all sorts of tricks with it. He  doesn't take himself seriously.\"    \"Does he regard himself as a joke?\"    \"Much worse; he regards himself as an imposition--as an abuse.\"    \"Well, perhaps he is,\" said Isabel.    \"Perhaps he is--though on the whole I don't think so. But in that case  what's more pitiable than a sentient, self-conscious abuse planted by  other hands, deeply rooted but aching with a sense of its injustice?  For me, in his place, I could be as solemn as a statue of Buddha.  He occupies a position that appeals to my imagination. Great  responsibilities, great opportunities, great consideration, great  wealth, great power, a natural share in the public affairs of a great  country. But he's all in a muddle about himself, his position, his  power, and indeed about everything in the world. He's the victim of a  critical age; he has ceased to believe in himself and he doesn't know  what to believe in. When I attempt to tell him (because if I were he I  know very well what I should believe in) he calls me a pampered bigot.  I believe he seriously thinks me an awful Philistine; he says I don't  understand my time. I understand it certainly better than he, who  can neither abolish himself as a nuisance nor maintain himself as an  institution.\"    \"He doesn't look very wretched,\" Isabel observed.    \"Possibly not; though, being a man of a good deal of charming taste, I  think he often has uncomfortable hours. But what is it to say of a being  of his opportunities that he's not miserable? Besides, I believe he is.\"    \"I don't,\" said Isabel.    \"Well,\" her cousin rejoined, \"if he isn't he ought to be!\"    In the afternoon she spent an hour with her uncle on the lawn, where the  old man sat, as usual, with his shawl over his legs and his large cup  of diluted tea in his hands. In the course of conversation he asked her  what she thought of their late visitor.    Isabel was prompt. \"I think he's charming.\"    \"He's a nice person,\" said Mr. Touchett, \"but I don't recommend you to  fall in love with him.\"    \"I shall not do it then; I shall never fall in love but on your  recommendation. Moreover,\" Isabel added, \"my cousin gives me rather a  sad account of Lord Warburton.\"    \"Oh, indeed? I don't know what there may be to say, but you must  remember that Ralph must talk.\"    \"He thinks your friend's too subversive--or not subversive enough! I  don't quite understand which,\" said Isabel.    The old man shook his head slowly, smiled and put down his cup. \"I don't  know which either. He goes very far, but it's quite possible he doesn't  go far enough. He seems to want to do away with a good many things, but  he seems to want to remain himself. I suppose that's natural, but it's  rather inconsistent.\"    \"Oh, I hope he'll remain himself,\" said Isabel. \"If he were to be done  away with his friends would miss him sadly.\"    \"Well,\" said the old man, \"I guess he'll stay and amuse his friends.  I should certainly miss him very much here at Gardencourt. He always  amuses me when he comes over, and I think he amuses himself as well.  There's a considerable number like him, round in society; they're very  fashionable just now. I don't know what they're trying to do--whether  they're trying to get up a revolution. I hope at any rate they'll put it  off till after I'm gone. You see they want to disestablish everything;  but I'm a pretty big landowner here, and I don't want to be  disestablished. I wouldn't have come over if I had thought they  were going to behave like that,\" Mr. Touchett went on with expanding  hilarity. \"I came over because I thought England was a safe country. I  call it a regular fraud if they are going to introduce any considerable  changes; there'll be a large number disappointed in that case.\"    \"Oh, I do hope they'll make a revolution!\" Isabel exclaimed. \"I should  delight in seeing a revolution.\"    \"Let me see,\" said her uncle, with a humorous intention; \"I forget  whether you're on the side of the old or on the side of the new. I've  heard you take such opposite views.\"    \"I'm on the side of both. I guess I'm a little on the side of  everything. In a revolution--after it was well begun--I think I should  be a high, proud loyalist. One sympathises more with them, and they've a  chance to behave so exquisitely. I mean so picturesquely.\"    \"I don't know that I understand what you mean by behaving picturesquely,  but it seems to me that you do that always, my dear.\"    \"Oh, you lovely man, if I could believe that!\" the girl interrupted.    \"I'm afraid, after all, you won't have the pleasure of going gracefully  to the guillotine here just now,\" Mr. Touchett went on. \"If you want to  see a big outbreak you must pay us a long visit. You see, when you come  to the point it wouldn't suit them to be taken at their word.\"    \"Of whom are you speaking?\"    \"Well, I mean Lord Warburton and his friends--the radicals of the upper  class. Of course I only know the way it strikes me. They talk about the  changes, but I don't think they quite realise. You and I, you know, we  know what it is to have lived under democratic institutions: I always  thought them very comfortable, but I was used to them from the first.  And then I ain't a lord; you're a lady, my dear, but I ain't a lord. Now  over here I don't think it quite comes home to them. It's a matter of  every day and every hour, and I don't think many of them would find it  as pleasant as what they've got. Of course if they want to try, it's  their own business; but I expect they won't try very hard.\"    \"Don't you think they're sincere?\" Isabel asked.    \"Well, they want to FEEL earnest,\" Mr. Touchett allowed; \"but it seems  as if they took it out in theories mostly. Their radical views are a  kind of amusement; they've got to have some amusement, and they might  have coarser tastes than that. You see they're very luxurious, and these  progressive ideas are about their biggest luxury. They make them feel  moral and yet don't damage their position. They think a great deal of  their position; don't let one of them ever persuade you he doesn't, for  if you were to proceed on that basis you'd be pulled up very short.\"    Isabel followed her uncle's argument, which he unfolded with his quaint  distinctness, most attentively, and though she was unacquainted with the  British aristocracy she found it in harmony with her general impressions  of human nature. But she felt moved to put in a protest on Lord  Warburton's behalf. \"I don't believe Lord Warburton's a humbug; I don't  care what the others are. I should like to see Lord Warburton put to the  test.\"    \"Heaven deliver me from my friends!\" Mr. Touchett answered. \"Lord  Warburton's a very amiable young man--a very fine young man. He has a  hundred thousand a year. He owns fifty thousand acres of the soil of  this little island and ever so many other things besides. He has half a  dozen houses to live in. He has a seat in Parliament as I have one at my  own dinner-table. He has elegant tastes--cares for literature, for art,  for science, for charming young ladies. The most elegant is his taste  for the new views. It affords"]]]
