When Arabia Islamized, the  practice changed its element for proselytism.    The Fourth Caliph is fabled to have travelled far, redressing the  injured, punishing the injurer, preaching to the infidel, and  especially protecting womenthe chief end and aim of knighthood. The  Caliph Al-Mutasim heard in the assembly of his courtiers that a woman of  Sayyid family had been taken prisoner by a Greek barbarian of Ammoria.  The man on one occasion struck her: when she cried Help me, O Mutasim! and  the clown said derisively, Wait till he cometh upon his pied steed! The  chivalrous prince arose, sealed up the wine-cup which he held in his  hand, took oath to do his knightly devoir, and on the morrow started  for Ammoria with seventy thousand men, each mounted on a piebald  charger. Having taken the place, he entered it, exclaiming, Labbayki,  Labbayki!Here am I at thy call! He struck off the caitiffs head, released  the lady with his own hands, ordered the cupbearer to bring the sealed  bowl, and drank from it, exclaiming, Now, indeed, wine is good!    To conclude this part of the subject with another far-famed instance.  When Al-Mutanabbi, the poet, prophet, and warrior of Hams (A.H. 354)  started together with his    [p.97] son on their last journey, the father proposed to seek a place  of safety for the night. Art thou the Mutanabbi, exclaimed his slave, who  wrote these lines,    I am known to the night, the wild, and the steed,  To the guest, and the sword, to the paper and reed[FN#29]?    The poet, in reply, lay down to sleep on Tigris bank, in a place haunted  by thieves, and, disdaining flight, lost his life during the hours of  darkness.    It is the existence of this chivalry among the Children of Antar which  makes the society of Badawin (damned saints, perchance, and honourable  villains,) so delightful to the traveller who[,] like the late Haji Wali  (Dr. Wallin), understands and is understood by them. Nothing more naïve  than his lamentations at finding himself in the loathsome company of  Persians, or among Arab townspeople, whose filthy and cowardly minds he  contrasts with the high and chivalrous spirit of the true Sons of the  Desert. Your guide will protect you with blade and spear, even against  his kindred, and he expects you to do the same for him. You may give a  man the lie, but you must lose no time in baring your sword. If  involved in dispute with overwhelming numbers, you address some elder,  Dakhil-ak ya Shaykh!(I am) thy protected, O Sir,and he will espouse your  quarrel with greater heat and energy, indeed, than if it were his  own.[FN#30] But why multiply instances?    The language of love and war and all excitement is poetry, and here,  again, the Badawi excels. Travellers complain that the wild men have  ceased to sing. This is true if poet be limited to a few authors whose  existence    [p.98] everywhere depends upon the accidents of patronage or political  occurrences. A far stronger evidence of poetic feeling is afforded by  the phraseology of the Arab, and the highly imaginative turn of his  commonest expressions. Destitute of the poetic taste, as we define it,  he certainly is: as in the Milesian, wit and fancy, vivacity and  passion, are too strong for reason and judgment, the reins which guide  Apollos car.[FN#31] And although the Badawin no longer boast a Labid or  a Maysunah, yet they are passionately fond of their ancient  bards.[FN#32] A man skilful in reading Al-Mutanabbi and the suspended  Poems would be received by them with the honours paid by civilisation  to the travelling millionaire.[FN#33] And their elders have a goodly  store of ancient and modern war songs, legends, and love ditties which  all enjoy.    [p.99]I cannot well explain the effect of Arab poetry to one who has  not visited the Desert.[FN#34] Apart from the pomp of words, and the  music of the sound,[FN#35] there is a dreaminess of idea and a haze  thrown over the object, infinitely attractive, but indescribable.  Description,    [p.100] indeed, would rob the song of indistinctness, its essence. To  borrow a simile from a sister art; the Arab poet sets before the mental  eye, the dim grand outlines of picture,which must be filled up by the  reader, guided only by a few glorious touches, powerfully standing out,  and by the sentiment which the scene is intended to express;whereas, we  Europeans and moderns, by stippling and minute touches, produce a  miniature on a large scale so objective as to exhaust rather than to  arouse reflection. As the poet is a creator, the Arabs is poetry, the  Europeans versical description. [FN#36] The language, like a faithful  wife, following the mind and giving birth to its offspring, and free  from that luggage of particles which clogs our modern tongues, leaves a  mysterious vagueness between the relation of word to word, which  materially assists the sentiment, not the sense, of the poem. When  verbs and nouns have, each one, many different significations, only the  radical or general idea suggests itself.[FN#37] Rich and varied  synonyms, illustrating the finest shades of meaning, are artfully used;  now scattered to startle us by distinctness, now to form as it were a  star about which dimly seen satellites revolve. And, to cut short a  disquisition    [p.101] which might be prolonged indefinitely, there is in the Semitic  dialect a copiousness of rhyme which leaves the poet almost unfettered  to choose the desired expression.[FN#38] Hence it is that a stranger  speaking Arabic becomes poetical as naturally as he would be witty in  French and philosophic in German. Truly spake Mohammed al-Damiri, Wisdom  hath alighted upon three thingsthe brain of the Franks, the hands of the  Chinese, and the tongues of the Arabs.    The name of Haramibrigandis still honourable among the Hijazi Badawin.  Slain in raid or foray, a man is said to die Ghandur, or a brave. He,  on the other hand, who is lucky enough, as we should express it, to die  in his bed, is called Fatis (carrion, the corps creve of the Klephts);  his weeping mother will exclaim, O that my son had perished of a cut  throat! and her attendant crones will suggest, with deference, that such  evil came of the will of Allah. It is told of the Lahabah, a sept of  the Auf near Rabigh, that a girl will refuse even her cousin unless, in  the absence of other opportunities, he plunder some article from the  Hajj Caravan in front of the Pashas links. Detected twenty years ago,  the delinquent would have been impaled; now he escapes with a  rib-roasting. Fear of the blood-feud, and the certainty of a shut road  to future travellers, prevent the Turks proceeding to extremes. They  conceal their weakness by pretending that  [p.102] the Sultan hesitates to wage a war of extermination with the  thieves of the Holy Land.    It is easy to understand this respect for brigands. Whoso revolts  against society requires an iron mind in an iron body, and these  mankind instinctively admires, however misdirected be their energies.  Thus, in all imaginative countries, the brigand is a hero; even the  assassin who shoots his victim from behind a hedge appeals to the fancy  in Tipperary or on the Abruzzian hills. Romance invests his loneliness  with grandeur; if he have a wife or a friends wife, romance becomes  doubly romantic, and a tithe of the superfluity robbed from the rich  and bestowed upon the poor will win to Gasparoni the hearts of a  people. The true Badawi style of plundering, with its numerous niceties  of honour and gentlemanly manners, gives the robber a consciousness of  moral rectitude. Strip off that coat, O certain person! and that turband,  exclaims the highwayman, they are wanted by the daughter of my paternal  uncle (wife). You will (of course, if necessary) lend ready ear to an  order thus politely attributed to the wants of the fair sex. If you  will add a few obliging expressions to the bundle, and offer Latro a  cup of coffee and a pipe, you will talk half your toilette back to your  own person; and if you can quote a little poetry, you will part the  best of friends, leaving perhaps only a pair of sandals behind you. But  should you hesitate, Latro, lamenting the painful necessity, touches up  your back with the heel of his spear. If this hint suffice not, he will  make things plain by the lances point, and when blood shows, the  tiger-part of humanity appears. Between Badawin, to be tamely  plundered, especially of the mare,[FN#39] is a lasting disgrace; a man  of    [p.103] family lays down his life rather than yield even to  overpowering numbers. This desperation has raised the courage of the  Badawin to high repute amongst the settled Arabs, who talk of single  braves capable, like the Homeric heroes, of overpowering three hundred  men.    I omit general details about the often-described Sar, or Vendetta. The  price of blood is $800 = 200l., or rather that sum imperfectly  expressed by live stock. All the Khamsah or Aamam, blood relations of  the slayer, assist to make up the required amount, rating each animal  at three or four times its proper value. On such occasions violent  scenes arise from the conflict of the Arabs two pet passions, avarice  and revenge. The avenger of blood longs to cut the foes throat. On the  other hand, how let slip an opportunity of enriching himself? His  covetousness is intense, as are all his passions. He has always a  project of buying a new dromedary, or of investing capital in some  marvellous colt; the consequence is, that he is insatiable. Still he  receives blood-money"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#19)"],[1,"of My humanity. My humanity is the road by which men must  travel. My Passion is the gate, through which they must enter. Away  then with thy cowardice of heart, and come to Me prepared for a hard  campaign. For it is not right for the servant to live softly and  delicately, while his Lord is fighting bravely. Come, I will now put  on thee My own armour. And so thou must thyself also experience the  whole of My Passion, so far as thy strength permits. Take,  therefore, the heart of a man; for be sure that thou wilt have to  endure many deaths, before thou canst put thy nature under the yoke.  I will sprinkle thy garden of spices with red flowers. Many are the  afflictions which will come upon thee; till thou hast finished thy  sad journey of bearing the cross, and hast renounced thine own will  and disengaged thyself so completely from all creatures, in all  things, which might hinder thine eternal salvation, as to be like  one about to die, and no longer mixed up with the affairs of this  life.    Servitor. Hard and grievous to bear are the things which Thou  sayest, Lord. I tremble all over. How can I bear all these things?  Suffer me, O Lord, to ask Thee something. Couldst Thou not devise  any other way of saving my soul, and of testifying Thy love towards  me, so as to spare Thyself such hard sufferings, and so that I need  not suffer so bitterly with Thee?    Wisdom. The unfathomable Abyss of My secret counsels no man ought to  seek to penetrate, for no one can comprehend it. And yet that which  thou hast suggested, and many other things, might have been  possible, which nevertheless never happen. Be assured, however, that  as created things now are, no more fitting method could be found.  The Author of Nature doth not think so much what He is able to do in  the world, as what is most fitting for every creature; and this is  the principle of His operations. And by what other means could the  secrets of God have been made known to man, than by the assumption  of humanity by Christ? By what other means could he who had deprived  himself of joy by the inordinate pursuit of pleasure, be brought  back more fittingly to the joys of eternity? And who would be  willing to tread the path, avoided by all, of a hard and despised  life, if God had not trodden it Himself? If thou wert condemned to  death, how could any one show his love and fidelity to thee more  convincingly, or provoke thee to love him in return more powerfully,  than by taking thy sentence upon himself? If, then, there is any one  who is not roused and moved to love Me from his heart by My immense  love, My infinite pity, My exalted divinity, My pure humanity, My  brotherly fidelity, My sweet friendship, is there anything that  could soften that stony heart?    Servitor. The light begins to dawn upon me, and I seem to myself to  see clearly that it is as Thou sayest, and that whoever is not  altogether blind must admit that this is the best and most fitting  of all ways. And yet the imitation of Thee is grievous to a slothful  and corruptible body.    Wisdom. Shrink not because thou must follow the footsteps of My  Passion. For he who loves God, and is inwardly united to Him, finds  the cross itself light and easy to bear, and has nought to complain  of. No one receives from Me more marvellous sweetness, than he who  shares My bitterest labours. He only complains of the bitterness of  the rind, who has not tasted the sweetness of the kernel. He who  relies on Me as his protector and helper may be considered to have  accomplished a large part of his task.    Servitor. Lord, by these consoling words I am so much encouraged,  that I seem to myself to be able to do and suffer all things through  Thee. I pray Thee, then, that Thou wilt unfold the treasure of Thy  Passion to me more fully.    Wisdom. When I was hung aloft and fastened to the wood of the cross  (which I bore for My great love to thee and all mankind), all the  wonted appearance of My body was piteously changed. My bright eyes  lost their light; My sacred ears were filled with mocking and  blasphemy; My sweet mouth was hurt by the bitter drink. Nowhere was  there any rest or refreshment for Me. My sacred head hung down in  pain; My fair neck was cruelly bruised; My shining face was  disfigured by festering wounds; My fresh colour was turned to  pallor. In a word, the beauty of My whole body was so marred, that I  appeared like a leper--I, the Divine Wisdom, who am fairer than the  sun.    Servitor. O brightest mirror of grace, which the Angels desire to  look into, in which they delight to fix their gaze, would that I  might behold Thy beloved countenance in the throes of death just  long enough to water it with the tears of my heart, and to satisfy  my mind with lamentations over it.    Wisdom. No one more truly testifies his grief over My Passion, than  he who in very deed passes through it with Me. Far more pleasing to  Me is a heart disentangled from the love of all transitory things,  and earnestly intent on gaining the highest perfection according to  the example which I have set before him in My life, than one which  continually weeps over My Passion, shedding as many tears as all the  raindrops that ever fell. For this was what I most desired and  looked for in My endurance of that cruel death--namely, that mankind  might imitate Me; and yet pious tears are very dear to Me.    Servitor. Since then, O most gracious God, the imitation of Thy most  gentle life and most loving Passion is so pleasing to Thee, I will  henceforth labour more diligently to follow Thy Passion than to weep  over it. But since both are pleasing to Thee, teach me, I pray Thee,  how I ought to conform myself to Thy Passion.    Wisdom. Forbid thyself the pleasure of curious and lax seeing and  hearing; let love make sweet to thee those things which formerly  thou shrankest from; eschew bodily pleasures; rest in Me alone; bear  sweetly and moderately the ills that come from others; desire to  despise thyself; break thy appetites; crush out all thy pleasures  and desires. These are the first elements in the school of Wisdom,  which are read in the volume of the book of My crucified body. But  consider whether anyone, do what he may, can make himself for My  sake such as I made Myself for his.    Servitor. Come then, my soul, collect thyself from all external  things, into the tranquil silence of the inner man. Woe is me! My  heavenly Father had adopted my soul to be His bride; but I fled far  from Him. Alas, I have lost my Father, I have lost my Lover. Alas,  alas, and woe is me! What have I done, what have I lost? Shame on  me, I have lost myself, and all the society of my heavenly country.  All that could delight and cheer me has utterly forsaken me; I am  left naked. My false lovers were only deceivers. They have stripped  me of all the good things which my one true Lover gave me; they have  despoiled me of all honour, joy, and consolation. O ye red roses and  white lilies, behold me a vile weed, and see also how soon those  flowers wither and die, which this world plucks. And yet, O most  gracious God, none of my sufferings are of any account, compared  with this, that I have grieved the eyes of my heavenly Father. This  is indeed hell, and a cross more intolerable than all other pain. O  heart of mine, harder than flint or adamant, why dost thou not break  for grief? Once I was called the bride of the eternal King, now I  deserve not to be called the meanest of his handmaids. Never again  shall I dare to raise mine eyes, for shame. O that I could hide  myself in some vast forest, with none to see or hear me, till I had  wept to my heart's desire. O Sin, Sin, whither hast thou brought me?  O deceitful World, woe to those who serve thee! Now I have thy  reward, I receive thy wages--namely, that I am a burden to myself  and the whole world, and always shall be.    Wisdom. Thou must by no means despair; it was for thy sins and those  of others that I came into this world, that I might restore thee to  Thy heavenly Father, and bring thee back to greater glory and honour  than thou ever hadst before.    Servitor. Ah, what is this, which whispers such flattering things to  a soul that is dead, abhorred, rejected?    Wisdom. Dost thou not know Me? Why art thou so despondent? Art thou  beside thyself with excessive grief, My dearest son? Knowest thou  not that I am Wisdom, most gentle and tender, in whom is the Abyss  of infinite mercy, never yet explored perfectly even by all the  saints, but none the less open to thee and all other sorrowing  hearts. I am he who for thy sake willed to be poor and an exile,  that I might recall thee to thy former honour. I am He who bore a  bitter death, that I might restore thee to life. I am thy Brother; I  am thy Bridegroom. I have put away all the wrong that thou ever  didst against Me, even as if it had never been, only henceforth,  thou must turn wholly to Me, and never again forsake Me. Wash away  thy stains in My blood. Lift up thy head, open thine eyes, and take  heart. In token of reconciliation, take this ring and put it on thy  finger as My bride, put on this robe, and these shoes on thy feet,  and receive this sweet and loving name, that thou mayst both be and  be called for ever My bride. Thou has cost Me much labour and pain;  for that cause, the Abyss of My mercy toward thee is unfathomable.    Servitor. O kindest Father, O sweetest Brother, O only joy of my  heart, wilt Thou be so favourable to my unworthy soul? What is this  grace? What is the Abyss of Thy clemency and mercy? From the bottom  of my heart I thank Thee, O heavenly Father, and beseech Thee by Thy  beloved Son, whom Thou hast willed to suffer a cruel death for love,  to forget my impieties. . . .    Now, O Lord, I remember that most loving word, wherewith in the book  of Ecclesiasticus[43] Thou drawest us to Thyself. \"Come to me, all  ye who desire me, and be filled with my fruits. I am the mother"]]]
