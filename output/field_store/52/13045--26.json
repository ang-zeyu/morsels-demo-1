[1] The Original has no title for this dish.        [2] List. and G.-V. here start the next formula, but      Tor. continues without interruption. Cf. Note 2 to No.      46.      [46] A DISH OF SCALLOPS     _ISICIA EX SPONDYLIS_ [1]    [Lightly] COOK SCALLOPS [or the firm part of oysters] REMOVE THE HARD  AND OBJECTIONABLE PARTS, MINCE THE MEAT VERY FINE, MIX THIS WITH  COOKED SPELT AND EGGS, SEASON WITH PEPPER, [shape into croquettes and  wrap] IN CAUL, FRY, UNDERLAY A RICH FISH SAUCE AND SERVE AS A  DELICIOUS ENTREE [2].        [1] Sch. _sfondilis_; G.-V. _sphondylis_; List.      _spongiolis_. According to Lister, this is a dish of      mushrooms, but he is wrong. He directs to remove sinews      when mushrooms haven't any, but shellfish have. Torinus      is correct. Gollmer makes the same mistake, believing      _spondyli_ to be identical with _spongioli_. He and      Danneil take _elixata_ for \"choice\" when this plainly      means \"cooked.\" If one were not sure of either word, the      nature of the subject would leave no room for any doubt.      Cf. note 1 to Nos. 115-121.        [2] We may find a reason for the combination of these      last three distinctly different formulae into one article      in the following explanation. It is possible that these      dishes were served together as one course, even on one      platter, thus constituting a single dish, as it were.      Such a dish would strongly resemble platters of      \"_fritures_\" and \"_fritto misto_\" (mixed fried foods)      esteemed in France and Italy. We, too, have \"Shore      Dinners\" and other \"Combination Platters\" with lobster,      crabs, scallops, shrimps, mushrooms, tomatoes--each      article prepared separately, but when served together      will form an integral part of ONE dish.        The above formulae, though somewhat incomplete, are good      and gastronomically correct. A combination of these      _isicia_ such as we here suggest would be entirely      feasible and would in fact make a dish of great      refinement, taxing the magiric artist's skill to the      utmost. We would class them among the _entremets chauds_      which are often used on a buffet table or as hot _hors      d'{oe}uvres_.      [47] ANOTHER KIND OF KROMESKIS [1]     _ALITER ISICIA OMENTATA_    FINELY CUT PULP [of pork] IS GROUND WITH THE HEARTS [2] OF WINTER  WHEAT AND DILUTED WITH WINE. FLAVOR LIGHTLY WITH PEPPER AND BROTH AND  IF YOU LIKE ADD A MODERATE QUANTITY OF [myrtle] BERRIES ALSO CRUSHED,  AND AFTER YOU HAVE ADDED CRUSHED NUTS AND PEPPER [3] SHAPE THE  FORCEMEAT INTO SMALL ROLLS, WRAP THESE IN CAUL, FRY, AND SERVE WITH  WINE GRAVY.        [1] Wanting in Lister.        [2] Fine wheat flour, cream of wheat.        [3] Either pepper corns or allspice.        The original leaves us in doubt as to the kind of meat      to be used, if any.        II      [48] DUMPLINGS OF PHEASANT     _ISICIA PLENA_    [Lightly roast choice] FRESH PHEASANTS [cut them into dice and mix  these with a] STIFF FORCEMEAT MADE OF THE FAT AND THE TRIMMINGS OF THE  PHEASANT, SEASON WITH PEPPER, BROTH AND REDUCED WINE, SHAPE INTO  CROQUETTES OR SPOON DUMPLINGS, AND POACH IN HYDROGARUM [water seasoned  with garum, or even plain salt water].

POACH YOUR LITTLE DUMPLINGS OF FORCEMEAT IN THIS  LIQUOR AND WHEN THEY ARE DONE SERVE IN A DISH FOR ISICIA, TO BE SIPPED  AT THE TABLE.      [50] CHICKEN FORCEMEAT     _ISICIA DE PULLO_    [Raw] CHICKEN MEAT, 1 LB. OF DARNEL [1] MEAL, ONE QUARTER PINT OF  STOCK AND ONE HALF OUNCE OF PEPPER.        [1] Tor. _lolae floris_; Hum.-List. and G.-V. _olei      floris_--virgin olive oil?--first choice flour? Goll.      olive (violet?) flowers; Dann. Olive oil.        The suggestion of oil is plausible because of the lack      of fat in chicken meat, but the quantity--1 lb.--is out      of question. Moreover, the binder would be lacking. This      is found in the Torinus rendering.        His _lolae floris_ should read _lolii_--from      _lolium_--darnel rye grass or ray grass which was      supposed to have intoxicating qualities, injurious to      the eye sight.--Ovid and Plautus. The seeds of this      grass were supposed to possess narcotic properties but      recent researches have cast doubt upon this theory.        A little butter, fresh cream and eggs are the proper      ingredients for chicken forcemeat. Any kind of flour for      binding the forcemeat would cheapen the dish. Yet some      modern forcemeats (sausage) contain as much as fifty      percent of some kind of meal. The most effective is that      of the soya bean which is not starchy.      [51] CHICKEN BROTH ANOTHER STYLE     _ALITER DE PULLO_    CHICKEN MEAT, 31 PEPPERCORNS CRUSHED, 1 CHOENIX [1] FULL OF THE VERY  BEST STOCK, A LIKE AMOUNT OF BOILED MUST AND ELEVEN MEASURES [2] OF  WATER. [Put this in a sauce pan] PLACE IT UPON THE FIRE TO SEETH AND  EVAPORATE SLOWLY.        [1] V. 2 _sextarii_; Tor. _ch{oe}nicem, cenlicem_; List.      _calicem_.        [2] _ch{oe}nices_?--left in doubt.        This seems to be a chicken broth, or essence for a sauce      or perhaps a medicine. Torinus mentions the chicken      meat, the others do not.        The original without interruption continues to describe      the _isicium simplex_ which has nothing to do with the      above.      [52] PLAIN DUMPLING WITH BROTH     _ISICIUM SIMPLEX_    TO 1 ACETABULUM [1] OF STOCK [2] ADD 7 OF WATER, A LITTLE GREEN  CELERY, A LITTLE SPOONFUL OF GROUND PEPPER, AND BOIL THIS WITH THE  SAUSAGE MEAT OR DUMPLINGS. IF YOU INTEND TAKING THIS TO MOVE THE  BOWELS THE SEDIMENT SALTS [3] OF HYDROGARUM HAVE TO BE ADDED [4].        [1] A measure, 15 Attic drachms.        [2] _liquamen_.        [3] Tor. _pectines, alias peces hydrogaro conditi_;      List. _sales_; G.-V. _faeces_.        [4] V. The formula is unintelligible, like No. 52 and      others, perhaps just another example of medicinal      cookery, dishes not only intended to nourish the body      but to cure also certain ills. Authors like Hannah      Wolley (The Queen-like Closet, London, 1675) and as late      as the middle of the 18th century pride themselves in      giving such quasi-Apician formulae.      [53] [Rank of] DISHES     _ISICIA_    [Entrees of] PEACOCK OCCUPY THE FIRST RANK, PROVIDED THEY BE DRESSED  IN SUCH MANNER THAT THE HARD AND TOUGH PARTS BE TENDER. THE SECOND  PLACE [in the estimation of the Gourmets] HAVE DISHES MADE OF RABBIT  [1] THIRD SPINY LOBSTER [2] FOURTH COMES CHICKEN AND FIFTH YOUNG PIG.        [1] List. and G.-V. Pheasant.        [2] Wanting in the above. Dann. Crane fourth.        _Isicia_, like in the foregoing formula, commences to      become a generic term for \"dishes.\"      [54] POTTED ENTREES     _ISICIA AMULATA AB AHENO_ [1]    GROUND PEPPER, LOVAGE, ORIGANY, VERY LITTLE SILPHIUM, A PINCH OF  GINGER AND A TRIFLE OF HONEY AND A LITTLE STOCK. [Put on the fire,  and when boiling] ADD THE ISICIA [sausage, meat balls and so forth] TO  THIS BROTH AND COOK THOROUGHLY. FINALLY THICKEN THE GRAVY WITH ROUX  [2] BY SOWING IT IN SLOWLY AND STIRRING FROM THE BOTTOM UP [3].        [1] Tor. _multa ab alieno_; Brandt _[a]mul[a]ta ab      aheno_; List. _amylata_--French: _lies_. _Ab aheno_--out      of the pot.        [2] French, for a mixture of wheat or rice flour with      fats or liquids to thicken fluids. _Amylum_, or _amulum_      which hereafter will occur frequently in the original      does not cover the ground as well as the French term      _roux_. The quality of the \"binder\" depends upon the      material in hand. Sometimes the fat and flour are      parched, sometimes they are used raw. Sometimes the      flour is diluted with water and used in that form.        [3] List. and G.-V. _sorbendum_; Tor. _subruendum_.      [55] ANOTHER [THICK ENTREE GRAVY]     _ALITER_    GRIND PEPPER WHICH HAS BEEN SOAKED OVERNIGHT, ADD SOME MORE STOCK AND  WORK IT INTO A SMOOTH PASTE; THEREUPON ADD QUINCE-APPLE CIDER, BOILED  DOWN ONE HALF, THAT IS WHICH HAS EVAPORATED IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN TO  THE CONSISTENCY OF HONEY. IF THIS IS NOT AT HAND, ADD FIG WINE [1]  CONCENTRATE WHICH THE ROMANS CALL \"COLOR\" [2]. NOW THICKEN THE GRAVY  WITH ROUX OR WITH SOAKED RICE FLOUR AND FINISH IT ON A GENTLE FIRE.        [1] Tor. _cammarum_, which should read _caricarum_--wine      of Carica figs.        [2] V. the Roman equivalent for \"_singe_,\" \"monkey,\"      \"_Affe_,\"--(the _vulgo_ French is literally translated      into and in actual use in other languages) caramel color      made of burnt sugar to give gravies a palatable      appearance. Cf. No. 73.        The reference by the original to \"which the Romans call      'color'\" indicates, according to Brandt, that this      formula is NOT of ROMAN origin but probably a      translation into Latin from a Greek cookery book.        This is an interesting suggestion, and it could be      elaborated on to say that the entire Apicius is NOT of      Roman origin. But why should the Greeks who in their      balmy days were so far in advance of Rome in culinary      matters go there for such information?        It is more likely that this reference to Rome comes from      the Italian provinces or the colonies, regions which      naturally would look to Rome for guidance in such      matters.      [56] ANOTHER AMULATUM     _AMULATUM ALITER_    DISJOINT A CHICKEN AND BONE IT. PLACE THE PIECES IN A STEW PAN WITH  LEEKS, DILL AND SALT [water or stock] WHEN WELL DONE ADD PEPPER AND  CELERY SEED, THICKEN WITH RICE [1] ADD STOCK, A DASH OF RAISIN WINE OR  MUST, STIR WELL, SERVE WITH THE ENTREES.

Grantline reached the window in time to see it  vanish around the building corner.    It was a giant figure, larger than a normal Earthman. A Martian?           *       *       *       *       *    Up on the summit of the crater the two small figures were still  fighting. All this turmoil had taken no more than a minute or two.    A lurking Martian outside? The brigand, Miko? More than ever,  Grantline was determined to get out. He shouted to his men to don some  of the other suits, and called for some of the hand bullet projectors.    But he could not get out through these main admission portes. He could  have forced the panels open perhaps; but with the pressure-changing  mechanisms broken, it would merely let the air out of the corridor. A  rush of air, probably uncontrollable. How serious the damage was no  one could tell as yet. It would perhaps take hours to repair it.    Grantline was shouting. \"Get those weapons! That's a Martian outside!  The brigand leader, probably! Get into your suits, anyone who wants to  go with me! We'll go by the manual emergency exit!\"    But the prowling Martian had found it! Within a minute Grantline was  there. It was a smaller, two-lock gateway of manual control, so that  the person going out could operate it himself. It was in a corridor at  the other end of the main building. But Grantline was too late! The  lever would not open the panels!    Had someone gone out this way and broken the mechanisms after him? A  traitor in the camp? Or had someone come in from outside? Or had the  skulking Martian outside broken this lock as he had broken the other?    The questions surged on Grantline. His men crowded around him. The  news spread. The camp was a prison. No one could get out.    And outside, the skulking Martian had disappeared. But Wilks and  Haljan were still fighting. Grantline could see the two figures up on  the observatory platform. They bounded apart, then together again.  Crazily swaying--bouncing--striking the rail.           *       *       *       *       *    They went together in a great leap off the platform onto the rocks,  and rolled in a bright patch of Earthlight. First one on top, then the  other, they rolled, unheeding, to the brink. Here, beyond the midway  ledge which held the camp, it was a sheer drop of a thousand feet, on  down to the crater-floor.    The figures were rolling: then one shook himself loose, rose up,  seized the other and, with a desperate lunge, shoved him--    The victorious figure drew back to safety. The other fell, hurtling  down into the shadows past the camp-level--down out of sight in the  darkness of the crater-floor.    Snap, who was in the group near Grantline at the windows, gasped.    \"God! Was that Gregg Haljan who fell?\"    No one could say. No one answered. Outside, on the camp-ledge, another  helmeted figure now became visible. It was not far from the main  building when Grantline first noticed it. It was running fast,  bounding toward the spider-staircase. It began mounting.    And now still another figure became visible--the giant Martian again.  He appeared from around the corner of the main Grantline building. He  evidently saw the winner of the combat on the cliff, who now was  standing in the Earthlight, gazing down. And he saw, too, no doubt,  the second figure mounting the stairs. He stood quite near the window  through which Grantline and his men were gazing, with his back to the  building, looking up to the summit. Then he ran with tremendous leaps  toward the ascending staircase.    Was it Haljan standing up there on the summit? Who was it climbing the  staircase? And was the third figure Miko?    Grantline's mind framed the questions. But his attention was torn from  them, and torn even from the swift silent drama outside. The corridor  was ringing with shouts.    \"We're imprisoned! Can't get out! Was Haljan killed? The brigands are  outside!\"    And then an interior audiphone blared a call for Grantline. Someone in  the instrument room of the adjoining building was talking:    \"Commander, I tried the telescope to see who got killed--\"    But he did not say who got killed, for he had greater news.    \"Commander! The brigand ship!\"    Miko's reinforcements from Mars had come.      CHAPTER XXV    _The Combat on the Crater-top_    Not Wilks, but Coniston! His drawling, British voice:    \"You, Gregg Haljan! How nice!\"    His voice broke off as he jerked his arm from me. My hand with the  bullet-protector came up, but with a sweeping blow he struck my  wrist. The weapon dropped to the rocks.    I fought instinctively, those first moments; my mind was whirling with  the shock of surprise. This was not Wilks, but the brigand Coniston.    His blow wrenched him around. Awkward, fighting in the air-puffed  suits, with only a body-weight of some thirty pounds! Coniston  stumbled over the rocks. I had still scarce recovered my wits, but I  avoided his outflung arms, and, stooping, tried to recover my  revolver. It lay nearby. But Coniston followed my scrambling steps and  fell upon me. My foot struck the weapon; it slid away and fell down a  crag into a six-foot pit.    We locked together, and when I rose erect he had me around the middle.  His voice jangled with broken syllables in my receiver.    \"Do for you now, Haljan--\"    It was an eery combat. We swayed, shoving, kicking, wrestling. His  hold around my middle shut off the Erentz circulation; the warning  buzz rang in my ears to mingle with the rasp of his curses. I flung  him off, and my tiny Erentz motors recovered. He staggered away, but  in a great leap came at me again.    I was taller, heavier and far stronger than Coniston. But I found him  crafty, and where I was awkward in handling my lightness, he seemed  more skilfully agile.           *       *       *       *       *    I became aware that we were on the twenty-foot square grid of the  observatory platform. It had a low metal railing. We surged against  it. I caught a dizzying glimpse of the abyss. Then it receded as we  bounced the other way. And then we fell to the grid. His helmet bashed  against mine, striking as though butting with the side of his head to  puncture my visor-panel. His gloved fingers were trying to rip at the  fabric around my throat.    As we regained our feet, I flung him off, and bounded, like a diver,  head-first into him. He went backward, but skilfully kept his feet,  gripped me again and shoved me.    I was tottering at the head of the staircase--falling. But I clutched  at him.    We fell some twenty or thirty feet to the next lower spider landing.  The impact must have dazed us both. I recall my vague idea that we had  fallen down the cliff--my Erentz motors smashed--my air shut off. Then  the air came again. The roaring in my ears was stilled; my head  cleared, and I found that we were on the landing--fighting.    He presently broke away from me, bounded to the summit, with me after  him. In the close confines of the suit I was bathed in sweat, and  gasping. I had had no thought to increase the oxygen content of my  air. But I sorely needed more oxygen for my laboring, pounding heart  and my panting breath. I fumbled for the oxygen control-lever. I could  not find it; or it would not operate.    I realized I was fighting sluggishly, almost aimlessly. But so was  Coniston!           *       *       *       *       *    It seemed dreamlike. A phantasmagoria of blows and staggering steps. A  nightmare with only the horrible vision of this goggled helmet always  before my eyes.    It seemed that we were rolling on the ground, back on the summit. The  unshadowed Earthlight was clear and bright. The abyss was beside me.  Coniston, rolling, was now on top, now under me, trying to shove me  over the brink. It was all like a dream--as though I were asleep,  dreaming that I did not have enough air.    I strove to keep my senses. He was struggling to roll me over the  brink. Ah, that would not do! But I was so tired. One cannot fight  without oxygen!    I suddenly knew that I had shaken him off and gained my feet. He rose  up, swaying. He was as tired, confused, half-asphyxiated as I.    The brink of the abyss was behind us. I lunged, desperately shoving,  avoiding his clutch.    He went over, and fell soundlessly, his body whirling end over end  down into the shadows, far down.    I drew back. My senses faded as I sank panting to the rocks. But with  inactivity, my thumping heart quieted. My respirations slowed. The  Erentz circulation gained on my poisoned air. It purified.    That blessed oxygen! My head cleared again. Strength came to me. I  felt better.    Coniston had fallen to his death. I was victor. I went to the brink,  cautiously, for I was still dizzy. I could see, far down there on the  crater-floor, a little patch of Earthlight in which a mashed human  figure was lying.           *       *       *       *       *    I staggered back again. A moment or two must have passed while I stood  there on the summit, with my senses clearing and my strength renewed  as the blood-stream cleared in my veins.    I was victor. Coniston was dead. I saw now, down on the lower  staircase below the camp-ledge, another goggled figure lying huddled.  That was Wilks, no doubt. Coniston had doubtless caught him there,  surprised him, killed him.    My attention, as I stood gazing, went down to the camp-buildings.  Another figure was outside! It bounded along the ledge, reached the  foot of the ascending staircase at the top of which I was standing.  With agile leaps, it came mounting at me!    Another brigand! Miko? No, it was not large enough to be Miko, not  nearly large enough. I was still confused. I thought of Hahn. But that  was absurd. Hahn was in the wreck of the _Planetara_. One of the  stewards then....    The figure came up the staircase recklessly, to assail me. I took a  step backward, bracing myself to receive this new antagonist.    And then"]]]
