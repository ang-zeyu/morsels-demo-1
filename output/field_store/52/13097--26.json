In Europe it is called the \"glutton\" from its  supposed gluttonous appetite. Among the Indians of the northwest it  is known as the \"mountain devil\" and in British Columbia is sometimes  called the \"skunk bear.\"    The animal really does bear some resemblance to the skunk in its  appearance and actions, the most noticeable of which is its habits of  raising its tail when disturbed or when it stops to listen to some  noise. Sometimes it will stand on its hind legs in order to get a  better view of some object which has aroused its interest.    The wolverine is not as active as the other members of the genus, but  its strength and cunning fully compensate for all that it lacks in  activity. It can seldom capture enough of game to satisfy its hunger,  therefore it seeks out and robs the caches of other animals, also  robs the traps of their bait and the captured animals. For this  reason the animal is despised and dreaded by the trapper. Once one  has found the trap line it will follow the trail to the end,  destroying the sets and eating the baits and catch. What it cannot  eat, it will carry away and conceal presumably for future use. It  will also sometimes enter the trapper's cabin and destroy or defile  all that it cannot eat.    Many strange stories are told of the animals cunning and of its evil  ways. While some of these tales are no doubt true, I feel safe in  saying that the majority have no foundation whatever. There is no  doubt that the wolverine is exceedingly wary and that it is a great  mischief maker, but the fact that the animal is not well known, has  led the nature writers to draw on their imaginations and these  wonderful stories are the result. We hear of the animal decoying deer  to its hiding place by dropping a bunch of moss for them to feed on,  and then springing upon the unsuspecting animal from a nearby limb.  We also read of the wolverine biting off the string of a set gun  without discharging the arm, so that it could eat the bait without  danger. That such stories are false goes without saying.    Not being plentiful in any one locality the animals are seldom  trapped and what few are caught are taken when they are visiting  camps or while robbing the traps of the bait and catch Trapping them  at all times is difficult work, owing to the natural wariness of the  animal. That the trap must be well concealed and that the animal must  be taken when off its guard will be evident to all. The No. 4 trap  should be used and only those which have strong springs, as the  wolverine possesses great strength.    The animals are not sought by the trapper and he may consider himself  lucky if there are none of them on his trapping ground. When they are  found, the trapper's aim is to get rid of them and the most certain  way appears to be by means of poison. When they visit the traps a  fair portion of strychnine placed in the bait will usually bring the  desired result.      [Illustration: The Pocket Gopher.]        CHAPTER XX.    THE POCKET-GOPHER.    The pocket-gopher is found throughout the Mississippi Valley, ranging  westward into Colorado and Wyoming, southward into Mexico, and  northward into the prairie region of Canada. They are also found in  Alabama, Georgia and Florida. They appear to be most abundant in  those states bordering on the Mississippi River. There are a number  of different varieties, but as their habits are the same, a  description of the Prairie pocket-gopher, will be sufficient.    This animal measures, when full grown, about eight inches from the  end of the nose to the base of the tail. The tail is about two and a  half inches long, and thinly covered with hair. The color is a liver  brown, somewhat lighter on the under parts; the feet white. The legs  are very short; the feet armed with large claws, adapted to digging.  The head is large, no neck being visible. The eyes and ears are very  small. The incisors are large and chisel shaped, for cutting roots.  On each side of the face and neck are large pouches, having no  opening into the mouth. These pouches are not used for carrying dirt,  as is commonly supposed, but are only used for carrying food. The  animals known as the \"grey-gopher\" and the \"striped-gopher\" are no  gophers at all, but species of ground squirrels.      [Illustration: Burrow of Pocket Gopher.]    The gopher is a burrowing animal and is seldom seen above ground.  They are working almost all of the time, during the spring, summer  and fall, extending the burrows in search of food. They also work in  winter, when the ground is not frozen, and it is supposed that they  also work under the frozen ground, when it is not frozen too deep.  They are most active in the fall when they are storing up food for  winter.    The burrows will be found from six to twelve inches beneath the  surface of the ground, the usual depth being about eight inches. At  irregular distances along the burrow, the animal makes a short branch  passage leading up to the surface, where it deposits the dirt dug  from the main passage, in the form of a mound. After the dirt is all  thrown out, it closes the branch passage, packing the ground in  solidly, so that the only visible signs of the burrow are the mounds  of ground. There is a good reason why the animal should be so careful  to keep the passage closed, for they have a number of enemies besides  man. Its most dangerous enemies are, perhaps, the little spotted  skunk or civet cat and the bull snake, as both of these creatures,  once they get inside of the burrow, follow its course until they find  their victim.    The food of the gopher consists mostly of roots of plants but they  often cut the roots of fruit trees. They are particularly destructive  to alfalfa, and the loss to farmers, caused by these animals, is  considerable, not only from the plants destroyed by having the roots  cut, but also from the plants buried under the mounds, and from the  fact that the mounds interfere with the cutting of the crop. The fur  is of no value, but owing to the destructiveness of the animals, land  owners are very anxious to be rid of them. In many places a bounty  is paid on the gopher, so that they may be profitably trapped when  fur-bearing animals are of no value.    The traps recommended for the gopher are the No. 0 steel trap and  some of the various choker traps made especially for this use. In  setting steel traps, select the freshest mound, and by examining  closely, one can usually tell which way the dirt was thrown out, and  will know on which side to look for the burrow. A handy tool is a  slender, pointed iron rod to use as a probe in searching for the  burrow. Having located the passage, open it up and set the trap on  the bottom, sinking it down until level. Cover it lightly with dirt,  and close the hole by laying a small piece of board, or a shingle  over the opening, covering with ground.    The trap should be fastened with a stick, and the same stick will  serve as a marker, so that one can easily find the trap. A small  spade or a heavy garden trowel will be needed for digging and for  convenience, the traps, stakes, etc., may be carried in a large  basket. The regular gopher traps, mentioned above, are more easily  set than steel traps and printed directions for setting usually  accompany the traps. They should be set at one side of the burrow, on  a level with the bottom and with the mouth of the trap just even with  the side of the passage. Just a little light should be allowed to  penetrate from behind, and all other parts should be closed, so as to  exclude light.    The gopher, in coming along the passage, sees the light and goes to  investigate, when it will be caught in the trap. If too much light  shows up, he does not go close to look at it, but immediately brings  a load of dirt and proceeds to close the hole, thus burying the trap.  All loose dirt should be removed from the burrow before setting the  trap, as otherwise the gopher will gather up the dirt as it  approaches the light, and shove it into the trap.      [Illustration: The Cottontail Rabbit.]        CHAPTER XXI.    THE RABBIT.    While the rabbit is classed among the fur-bearing animals, the skin  having a slight market value, very few of the trappers ever market  the skins as the price is so little that trapping the animals for  their fur would not be a lucrative business.    The flesh is much used as food by the northern hunters and trappers,  and also as bait for traps, and it is well for the trapper to know  something about the animal and how to capture it.    Properly speaking there are no rabbits in North America, the animals  known by that name being classed by naturalists as hares, but the  name is so universally used that it would be useless now to try to  bring the true name into general use.    There are many species, one or more of which will be found in almost  every locality of North America, but the most important species are  the common cottontail, the jack rabbit and the snowshoe rabbit, or  varying hare. Of these there are many varieties, but they are so  similar in appearance and habits that I do not consider it necessary  or advisable to go into detail in describing them in a work of this  kind.    Rabbits belong to the class known as rodents or gnawing animals, and  are distinctly different in structure from all other animals of the  class. The long hind legs, long ears, small tail and soft fur is  characteristic of the genus.    The common cottontail is found in almost all parts of the United  States, in certain parts of the north only, being replaced by the  snowshoe rabbit. They are smaller than the snowshoe and jack rabbits  and are of a grayish brown on the back and sides shading to white on  the under parts. The fur is a reddish brown in summer.    Their food consists of grasses, fruits and vegetables, bark, and the  leaves of evergreen shrubs such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#19)"],[1," of a red eagle has driven all the birds of the  air out of our country. Every day this eagle circles above the village,  and so powerful is it that anyone being caught outside of his tent  is descended upon and his skull split open to the brain by the sharp  breastbone of the Eagle. Many a marksman has tried his skill on this  bird, all to no purpose.    \"Another evil spirit in the form of a white rabbit has driven out all  the animals which inhabit the ground, and destroyed the fields of corn  and turnips, so the nation is starving, as the arrows of the marksmen  have also failed to touch the white rabbit. Any one who can kill these  three witches will receive as his reward, the choice of two of the most  beautiful maidens of our nation. The younger one is the handsomer of the  two and has also the sweetest disposition. Many young, and even old men,  hearing of this (our chief's) offer, have traveled many miles to try  their arrows on the witches, but all to no purpose. Our chief, hearing  of your great marksmanship, sent me to try and secure your services to  have you come and rid us of these three witches.\"    Thus spoke the stranger to the hunter. The hunter gazed long and  thoughtfully into the dying embers of the camp fire. Then slowly his  eyes raised and looked lovingly on his wife who sat opposite to him.  Gazing on her beautiful features for a full minute he slowly dropped his  gaze back to the dying embers and thus answered his visitor:    \"My friend, I feel very much honored by your chief having sent such  a great distance for me, and also for the kind offer of his lovely  daughter in marriage, if I should succeed, but I must reject the great  offer, as I can spare none of my affections to any other woman than to  my queen whom you see sitting there.\"    White Plume had been listening to the conversation and when his father  had finished speaking, said: \"Father, I am a child no more. I have  arrived at manhood. I am not so good a marksman as you, but I will go to  this suffering tribe and try to rid them of their three enemies. If this  man will rest for a few days and return to his village and inform them  of my coming, I will travel along slowly on his trail and arrive at the  village a day or two after he reaches there.\"    \"Very well, my son,\" said the father, \"I am sure you will succeed, as  you fear nothing, and as to your marksmanship, it is far superior to  mine, as your sight is much clearer and aim quicker than mine.\"    The man rested a few days and one morning started off, after having  instructed White Plume as to the trail. White Plume got together what  he would need on the trip and was ready for an early start the next  morning. That night Dead Shot and his wife sat up away into the night  instructing their son how to travel and warning him as to the different  kinds of people he must avoid in order to keep out of trouble. \"Above  all,\" said the father, \"keep a good look out for Unktomi (spider); he is  the most tricky of all, and will get you into trouble if you associate  with him.\"    White Plume left early, his father accompanying him for several miles.  On parting, the father's last words were: \"Look out for Unktomi, my son,  he is deceitful and treacherous.\" \"I'll look out for him, father;\" so  saying he disappeared over a hill. On the way he tried his skill on  several hawks and eagles and he did not need to use his painted arrows  to kill them, but so skillful was he with the bow and arrows that he  could bring down anything that flew with his common arrows. He was  drawing near to the end of his destination when he had a large tract of  timber to pass through. When he had nearly gotten through the timber he  saw an old man sitting on a log, looking wistfully up into a big tree,  where sat a number of prairie chickens.    \"Hello, grandfather, why are you sitting there looking so downhearted?\"  asked White Plume. \"I am nearly starved, and was just wishing some one  would shoot one of those chickens for me, so I could make a good meal on  it,\" said the old man. \"I will shoot one for you,\" said the young man.  He strung his bow, placed an arrow on the string, simply seemed to raise  the arrow in the direction of the chicken (taking no aim). Twang went  out the bow, zip went the arrow and a chicken fell off the limb, only  to get caught on another in its descent. \"There is your chicken,  grandfather.\" \"Oh, my grandson, I am too weak to climb up and get it.  Can't you climb up and get it for me?\" The young man, pitying the old  fellow, proceeded to climb the tree, when the old man stopped him,  saying: \"Grandson, you have on such fine clothes, it is a pity to spoil  them; you had better take them off so as not to spoil the fine porcupine  work on them.\" The young man took off his fine clothes and climbed up  into the tree, and securing the chicken, threw it down to the old  man. As the young man was scaling down the tree, the old man said:  \"Iyashkapa, iyashkapa,\" (stick fast, stick fast). Hearing him say  something, he asked, \"What did you say, old man?\" He answered, \"I was  only talking to myself.\" The young man proceeded to descend, but he  could not move. His body was stuck fast to the bark of the tree. In vain  did he beg the old man to release him. The old Unktomi, for he it was,  only laughed and said: \"I will go now and kill the evil spirits, I have  your wonderful bow and arrows and I cannot miss them. I will marry the  chief's daughter, and you can stay up in that tree and die there.\"    So saying, he put on White Plume's fine clothes, took his bow and arrows  and went to the village. As White Plume was expected at any minute, the  whole village was watching for him, and when Unktomi came into sight the  young men ran to him with a painted robe, sat him down on it and slowly  raising him up they carried him to the tent of the chief. So certain  were they that he would kill the evil spirits that the chief told him to  choose one of the daughters at once for his wife. (Before the arrival  of White Plume, hearing of him being so handsome, the two girls had  quarreled over which should marry him, but upon seeing him the younger  was not anxious to become his wife.) So Unktomi chose the older one of  the sisters, and was given a large tent in which to live. The younger  sister went to her mother's tent to live, and the older was very proud,  as she was married to the man who would save the nation from starvation.  The next morning there was a great commotion in camp, and there came the  cry that the white buffalo was coming. \"Get ready, son-in-law, and kill  the buffalo,\" said the chief.    Unktomi took the bow and arrows and shot as the buffalo passed, but the  arrow went wide off its mark. Next came the eagle, and again he shot and  missed. Then came the rabbit, and again he missed.    \"Wait until tomorrow, I will kill them all. My blanket caught in my bow  and spoiled my aim.\" The people were very much disappointed, and the  chief, suspecting that all was not right, sent for the young man who had  visited Dead Shot's tepee. When the young man arrived, the chief asked:  \"Did you see White Plume when you went to Dead Shot's camp?\" \"Yes, I  did, and ate with him many times. I stayed at his father's tepee all the  time I was there,\" said the young man. \"Would you recognize him if you  saw him again?\" asked the chief. \"Any one who had but one glimpse of  White Plume would surely recognize him when he saw him again, as he is  the most handsome man I ever saw,\" said the young man.    \"Come with me to the tent of my son-in-law and take a good look at him,  but don't say what you think until we come away.\" The two went to the  tent of Unktomi, and when the young man saw him he knew it was not White  Plume, although it was White Plume's bow and arrows that hung at the  head of the bed, and he also recognized the clothes as belonging to  White Plume. When they had returned to the chief's tent, the young man  told what he knew and what he thought. \"I think this is some Unktomi who  has played some trick on White Plume and has taken his bow and arrows  and also his clothes, and hearing of your offer, is here impersonating  White Plume. Had White Plume drawn the bow on the buffalo, eagle and  rabbit today, we would have been rid of them, so I think we had better  scare this Unktomi into telling us where White Plume is,\" said the young  man.    \"Wait until he tries to kill the witches again tomorrow,\" said the  chief.    In the meantime the younger daughter had taken an axe and gone into the  woods in search of dry wood. She went quite a little distance into the  wood and was chopping a dry log. Stopping to rest a little she heard  some one saying: \"Whoever you are, come over here and chop this tree  down so that I may get loose.\" Going to where the big tree stood, she  saw a man stuck onto the side of the tree. \"If I chop it down the fall  will kill you,\" said the girl. \"No, chop it on the opposite side from  me, and the tree will fall that way. If the fall kills me, it will be  better than hanging up here and starving to death,\" said White Plume,  for it was he.    The girl chopped the tree down and when she saw that it had not killed  the man, she said: \"What shall I do now?\" \"Loosen the bark from the tree  and then get some stones and heat them. Get some water and sage and put  your blanket over me.\" She did as told and when the steam arose from  the water being poured upon the heated rocks, the bark loosened from his  body and he arose. When he stood up, she saw how handsome he was. \"You  have saved my life,\" said he. \"Will you be my wife?\" \"I will,\" said she.  He then told her how the old man had fooled him into this trap and took  his bow and arrows, also his fine porcupine worked clothes, and had gone  off, leaving him to die. She, in turn, told him all that had happened  in camp since a man, calling himself White Plume, came there and married  her sister before he shot at"]]]
