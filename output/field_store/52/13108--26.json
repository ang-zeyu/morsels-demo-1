One of these,  resembling Palma and Lotto, but slightly known beyond the precincts of  Bergamo and some adjacent cities, is Giovanni Cariani, as to whom Vasari  is altogether silent. One of his pieces, representing our Saviour, along  with several saints, and dated 1514, I have myself seen at Milan, which  appears to have been altogether formed upon the model of Giorgione. If I  mistake not, it is a juvenile production, and when compared with some  others, which I saw at Bergamo, very indifferent in its forms. The most  excellent of any from his hand, is a Virgin, preserved at the Servi,  with a group of beatified spirits, a choir of angels, and other angels  at her feet, engaged in playing upon their harps in concert. It is an  exceedingly graceful production, delightfully ornamented with landscape  and figures in the distance; very tasteful in its tints, which are  blended in a manner equal to the most studied specimens of the two  artists of Bergamo, already mentioned; thus forming with them a  triumvirate, calculated to reflect honour upon any country. It has been  stated by Tassi, that the celebrated Zuccherelli never visited Bergamo,  without returning to admire the beauties of this picture, pronouncing it  one of the finest specimens of the art he had ever beheld, and the best  which that city had to boast. Cariani was also no less distinguished as  a portrait painter, as we gather from a piece belonging to the Counts  Albani, containing various portraits of that noble family; and which,  surrounded with specimens of the best colourists; would almost appear to  be the only one deserving of peculiar admiration.    The city of Trevigi may boast of two artists belonging to the same  class, though widely differing from each other. One of these is Rocco  Marconi, distinguished by Zanetti among some of the best disciples of  Bellini, and erroneously referred by Ridolfi to the school of Palma. He  excelled in accuracy of design, taste of colouring, and diligence of  hand, though not always sufficiently easy in his contours, and for the  most part exhibiting a severity almost approaching to plebeian  coarseness in his countenances. Even in the earliest production  attributed to him, executed in the year 1505, and preserved in the  church of San Niccolo, at Trevigi, Ridolfi detects that peculiar  clearness of style, which may be traced also so strongly in his Three  Apostles, at SS. Giovanni and Paolo, as well as in his few other  pictures dispersed among the public places. Indeed half-length figures  of this artist are by no means of rare occurrence in private  collections, though he can boast no single specimen so beautiful, or so  completely _Giorgionesque_ as his Judgment of the Adulteress, to be seen  in the chapter of San Giorgio Maggiore, and of which there is either a  duplicate or a copy at San Pantaleo, and in other places. The other of  these two artists is Paris Bordone, the elevation of whose mind and  genius seemed to correspond with that of his birth. After having been a  pupil of Titian for a short period, he became an enthusiastic imitator  of Giorgione, finally adopting an originality of manner, whose peculiar  grace bears no resemblance to that of any other painter. His forms may  truly be said to breathe, to glow, and even to laugh, with a force of  colouring, which, incapable of displaying a greater degree of truth than  that of Titian, aimed, nevertheless, at more variety and attraction;  while, at the same time, they were not wanting in delicacy of design,  novelty of drapery, propriety of composition, and a peculiarly lively  air of the heads. In the church of S. Giobbe he produced a picture of S.  Andrew embracing his Cross, with an angel seen hovering above, in the  act of bestowing upon him the crown of martyrdom; while in one of the  two saints, represented at the side, he drew the figure of S. Peter, in  the act of gazing upon him with a kind of envy; an idea equally novel  and picturesque. A similar method he adopted in other of his works,  produced in great part for the ornament of his native place and its  vicinity. Not a subject but is taken from the antique; yet each of them  is treated with originality. Of such kind, is that picture of a true  Paradise, seen in the Ognissanti at Trevigi, and those evangelical  mysteries in the cathedral of the same city, represented in an  altarpiece, divided into six different groups, at the request, it is  presumed, of the person who engaged him to execute it. Here we behold,  assembled in a small space, every thing of the most pleasing and  beautiful kind, which he has elsewhere scattered throughout the whole of  his works. In Venice, his representation of the restoration of the ring  to the Doge by a fisherman, possesses a high reputation; and this,  accompanied with that of the Tempest, shortly before described, by  Giorgione, forms an admirable contrast in its beauty to the terrors  abounding in the latter. Decorated with the finest specimens of  architecture, and a profusion of animated and well adapted figures, as  varied in their actions as in their draperies, it has been commended by  Vasari as the masterpiece of his labours. The same artist is, likewise,  highly prized in collections. Madonnas of his are to be met with,  characterized by the uniformity of their countenance, as well as some of  his portraits, often attired in the manner of Giorgione, and composed  with fine and novel embellishments. Being invited to the court of  Francis II., he acquired the favour of that monarch and of his  successor, thus enriching himself by the exercise of his talents. He had  a son who pursued the same branches of the art; but from his picture of  Daniel, remaining at Santa Maria Formosa in Venice, it is evident how  very inferior he must have been.    At the same time flourished one Girolamo da Trevigi, a different artist  to his namesake already mentioned by us, who, induced probably by the  example of his noble fellow citizen, and turning his attention to a more  select style than the generality of the Venetian School, applied himself  to the models of Raffaello, and the Romans. He is entitled by Padre  Federici, upon the authority of Mauro, Pennacchi, and is considered by  him the son of that Piermaria, of whom we made brief mention before,  (page 62). There is little from his hand remaining at Venice, but more  in Bologna, particularly at San Petronio, where he painted in oil the  histories of S. Antony of Padua, with judgment and grace, combined with  an exquisite degree of polish, which obtained for him the commendation  of Vasari. It was here he happily succeeded in uniting the excellences  of the two schools, though he did not flourish long enough to mature  them, having devoted himself to the military occupation of an engineer,  to which service he fell a victim in 1544, while in England; he was  killed, according to Vasari, in his thirty-sixth year. On this last  point we can scarcely admit the emendation offered us by the author of  the Description of Vicenza, who would substitute for this earlier date  the age of seventy-six years, a period of life when men seldom encounter  their final doom in the field. In this instance, perhaps, the emendator  was not aware that there exist signatures of a Girolamo da Treviso, met  with upon pictures from the year 1472 to that of 1487, uniformly of  ancient design; an artist, who could not, in the common course of life,  have survived to become an excellent disciple of Raffaello, and the  assistant of Pupini at Bologna, about the year 1530. He failed,  therefore, to make a distinction between two painters of the same name,  as it will be perceived we have done, followed by the authority of Padre  Federici.    Finally, in this list must be enumerated Gio. Antonio Licinio, either  Sacchiense, or Cuticello,[44] until such period, as happening to be  wounded in the hand by his brother, he renounced all title to his family  name, assuming the appellation of Regillo. He is commonly, however,  called Pordenone, from his native place, formerly a province, and now a  city of the Friuli. \"In this province,\" it is observed by Vasari, \"there  flourished, during his time, a great number of excellent artists, who  had never visited either Florence or Rome; but he stood pre-eminent  above all, surpassing his predecessors in the conception of his pieces,  in design, in boldness, in the use of his colours, in his frescos, in  rapidity, in grandeur of relief; and, indeed, in every other attribute  of the arts.\" It is uncertain whether he attended the School of  Castelfranco, as it has been supposed by some, and much more so, whether  he was a fellow student along with him and Titian, under Giovanni  Bellini, a supposition started by Rinaldis, (p. 62). To me, the opinion  reported by Ridolfi appears nearer the truth, that having first studied,  in his youth, the productions of Pelligrino, at Udine, he subsequently  adopted the manner of Giorgione, following the bias of his own genius,  invariably the artist's safest guide in the formation of a style. Other  disciples of Giorgione, more or less resembled him in manner, but  Pordenone seemed to vie with him in spirit, a spirit equally daring,  resolute, and great; surpassed by no other, perhaps, in the Venetian  School. Yet in lower Italy he is little known beyond his name. The  picture with the portraits of his family, preserved in the Palazzo  Borghese, is the best production of his that I have met with in these  parts. And elsewhere, indeed, we rarely behold such histories as his  exquisite picture of the Raising of Lazarus, in possession of the Conti  Lecchi, at Brescia. Nor does he abound in altarpieces, beyond the  province of Friuli, which boasts of several in different places, though  not all equally genuine. The few executed in Pordenone, are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#19)"],[1,"back to their source,  you may always expect to crash up against Vested Interests.  For instance,  the great Fact of the English Reformation was the confiscation  of Church property.  Afterward, a Protestant England submitted peaceably  to the Inquisition; but when Mary proposed restitution of the abbey tenures--  whoop! to your tents, O Israel! The noble army of prospective martyrs  could n't conform to that heresy; and the stubborn Tudor had to back down.  Again, Wesleyanism tapped the offertory of Episcopalianism,  and thus earned the undying hatred of that Church--though in point of doctrine,  the two are practically identical.  But the prejudice of the Irish Protestant  against the Irish Catholic has the basest origin of all.    The English and Scotch colonists drafted into Ulster by Elizabeth, James I,  Cromwell, and William III, always evinced a tendency to become Irish  in the second generation.  The reason is plain.  Devil-worship--  the cult of Fear--was the territorial religion of Ireland;  and, in this bitter fellowship, native Catholic and acclimatised Protestant  sank their small sectarian differences.  The almighty and eternal Landlord,  of course, was the Power who had to be placated by tribute and incense,  approached on all fours, and glorified in the highest.    We don't know much of the non-political history of Ireland  during the 18th century, and indeed there is not much to be known.  An Irish Parliament, consisting solely of landlords and their nominees,  legislated as men do when the personal equation is allowed to pass unchecked.  Meanwhile the agent collected such rents as he could get, with an occasional  charge of slugs thrown in gratis:  and the finest peasantry  in the world slaved, starved, lied, stole, attended the means of grace,  got drunk as often as possible, married and gave in marriage,  harnessed itself to the landlord's carriage whenever that three-bottle divinity  deigned an avatar, and hoarded up its pennies for the annual confiscation.  Broadly speaking, it rendered unto Caesar the things that were Caesar's,  and unto God the things that were God's--social-economic conditions  being so arranged that Caesar's title covered everything except  an insignificant by-product of atrophied souls.    However, we are concerned only with Ulster, where the native element  of population, oblivious to Thrift, and instinctively loyal to anything  in the shape of supremacy, had become alloyed with an ingredient  derived from the most contumacious brood at that tirne in Western Europe,  namely, the so-called Anglo-Saxon--a people unpleasantly apt in drawing  a limit-line to aggression on its pocket, and by no means likely  to content itself with an appeal to the Saints or the Muses.  But was there  no sectarian line of cleavage?--was there no party spirit abroad, seeing that,  for the alleged safety of the Protestant population, the Catholics lived  under severe penal laws?  Well----    'We hold the right of private judgment in matters of religion to be  equally sacred in others as in ourselves; and, as men, as Christians,  and as Protestants, we rejoice in the relaxation of the penal laws  against our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects; and we believe the measure to be  fraught with the happiest consequences to the union and prosperity of Ireland.'    That is part of a resolution carried with only two dissentient voices  in a meeting composed of the delegates of 143 corps of Ulster Volunteers,  numbering 25,000 men.  The meeting was held at Dungannon, Tyrone, in 1782.  The Volunteers were tenants who, in 1778, had spontaneously enrolled  themselves for defence against foreign invasion; all Protestants, of course,  inasmuch as the possession of arms, except by special license, was prohibited  to Catholics;--though at this time (the American War being then in progress)  the feeling of the Irish Protestant was strongly revolutionary,  while the Irish Catholic, true to his fatal instinct of illogical veneration,  was distinctly loyalist.  Otherwise, the bond of a common nationality  had overborne sectarian estrangement; and never before or since has Ireland  seen a period when the professors of those hostile creeds got drunk together  in such amity.  This is a historical fact which cannot be too often repeated.    'Probably at no period since the days of Constantine,' says the accomplished  and trustworthy Lecky, 'was Catholicism so free from domineering  and aggressive tendencies as during the Pontificates of Benedict XIV  and his three successors.' This covers a period extending from 1740 to 1775;  and we know that cycles of ecclesiastical polity never close abruptly.  The Catholic was first to perceive that 'when lenity and cruelty play  for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.'    But the Volunteers--armed and organised without the invitation or concurrence  of Government--now began to propose reforms in parliamentary representation,  amendments in internal legislation, a relaxation of trade restrictions,  &c.  So it was time for the man with a stake in the country to think about  doing something.    Divide and govern! A good ideal though not a new one!  And, providentially,  here was the latent spark of religious dissent, ready to respond  to the foulest breath ever blown from the lips of Greed.  In 1785 the spark  was first fanned into flame, with the best results; then, the satisfactory  working of the experiment being assured, the first Orange Lodge was formally  inaugurated at Loughlea, Armagh, in 1795--exactly 105 years after  the dethronement and expulsion of James II, and 93 years after the death  of William of Orange.    Patronised by noblemen, gentlemen, clergymen, and intermediary pimps  of substantial position, the institution naturally appealed to the highest  sentiments (which is saying extremely little) of a Protestant half-population  forced into servility by agrarian conditions.  Soon it became self-supporting,  and waxed mighty in the land, feeding itself with fresh vendetta  from each recurring 12th of July.    Observe its origin well.  The profound cunning of a propertied class,  operating with sinister purpose on the inevitable flunkeyism  of a dependent class, per medium of that moral kink in human nature  which makes sectarian persecution an act of worship, generated  an accordant monster.  Hence any L.O.L.  convocation, however slenderly  attended, may fitly be called a monster meeting.    The domestic history of the movement in its palmy days--the brutal  and cowardly baiting of a penalised class; the boorish insult to ideals  held sacred by sensitive devotees; the deliberate cultivation  of intra--parochial blood-feud; the savage fostering of hate  for hate's own sake; the thousand squalid details of affray, ambuscade,  murder, maltreatment, malicious injury to property--these, happily  or unhappily, rest on fast-perishing oral tradition alone.  But the whole record, though not the most flagrant in modern history,  is undeniably the vilest.  'Who,' asks Job, 'can bring a clean thing  out of an unclean?'  And his answer is superfluous.    A fixed resolution to avoid the very appearance of digression in these annals  prevents my referring to various sporadic Irish combinations  of the 18th century--Whiteboys, Steelboys, Oakboys, Peep-o'-day Boys,  Defenders--some Catholic, some Protestant, some mixed; but each representing  an inarticulate protest against agrarian or ecclesiastical aggression.  Notice, however, that the customary dragging in of these irrelevancies,  to confuse the main issue, is not to be wondered at, seeing that  Orangeism itself is based, in a large, general way, on the Bible.  But again, what fanatical lunacy or class-atrocity of Christendom  was ever based on anything else?    O Catholic and Protestant slaves of dogma!  Zealots, Idumaeans, partisans  of ye know not what! Fools all!--whooping for your Ananus,  your John of Giscala, your Simon of Bargioras; and fighting amongst yourselves,  whilst the invincible legionaries of Science advance confidently  on your polluted Temple! Small sympathy have ye from this Josephus.]    But Rory, poor fellow, had all the impressions of party spirit built into  his moral system.  It was a vital and personal fact to him,  though only a historical truth to me, that this hereditary war  of the Big-endians and Little-endians had been conducted by our own  immediate forefathers.  Strictly speaking, mind you, neither party  cracked the egg--that too--dainty product being taboo for rent--but  they compromised by cracking each other's domes of thought.  Rory could n't  get away from the strong probability that my grandfather had overpowered  his own contemporary ancestor in the name of the Glorious, Pious  and Immortal Memory, and had chopped his head off with a spade.  He was  willing to let bygones be bygones; but--No more o' that, an thou lovest me!    Yet he showed a distinctly intelligent interest, as well as  a complacent assent, when I pointed out to him the irony of the Orangeman's  situation.  England's original title to the over-rule of Ireland--and a  perfectly valid one, as times went then--was the momentous bull  of Pope Adrian IV, issued to Henry II, in 1155.  And any private title to land  in Ireland, traced back through inheritance, purchase, or what not,  must lead to a Royal grant as its source; the authority for such grant  being the Papal bull aforesaid, and the validity of the bull  resting on the Pope's temporal power.  Now, the Orangeman is prepared  to die in his last hiding-place in vindication of the English domination,  that rests on the Papal bull, that is warranted by the Pope's temporal power,  that lay in the house that Peter built.  To be sure, provided a title be safe,  its value is not affected though it may have emanated from  the Father of Lies himself.  But we should frankly say so.    Rory's character was made up of two fine elements, the poetic and the "]]]
