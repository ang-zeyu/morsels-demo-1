But 7,000 of       these banished people were driven on board ships, and       scattered among the English colonies, from New Hampshire to       Georgia alone; 1,020 to South Carolina alone. They were cast       ashore without resources; hating the poor-house as a shelter       for their offspring, and abhorring the thought of selling       themselves as laborers. Households, too, were separated; the       colonial newspapers contained advertisements of members of       families seeking their companions, of sons anxious to reach       and relieve their parents, of mothers mourning for their       children. The wanderers sighed for their native country; but       to prevent their return, their villages, from Annapolis to       the isthmus, were laid waste. Their old homes were but       ruins. In the district of Minas, for instance, 250 of their       houses, and more than as many barns, were consumed. The live       stock which belonged to them, consisting of great numbers of       horned cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses, were seized as       spoils and disposed of by the English officials. A beautiful       and fertile tract of country was reduced to a solitude.       There was none left round the ashes of the cottages of the       Acadians but the faithful watch-dog, vainly seeking the       hands that fed him. Thickets of forest-trees choked their       orchards; the ocean broke over their neglected dikes, and       desolated their meadows.\"    Nor were the woes of this ill-treated people ended:         \"Relentless misfortune pursued the exiles whereever they       fled. Those sent to Georgia, drawn by a love for the spot       where they were born as strong as that of the captive Jews,       who wept by the side of the rivers of Babylon for their own       temple and land, escaped to sea in boats, and went coasting       from harbor to harbor; but when they had reached New       England, just as they would have set sail for their native       fields, they were stopped by orders from Nova Scotia. Those       who dwelt on the St. John's were torn once more from their       new homes. When Canada surrendered, hatred with its worst       venom pursued the 1,500 who remained south of the       Ristigouche. Once more those who dwelt in Pennsylvania       presented a humble petition to the Earl of Loudoun, then the       British Commander in-Chief in America; and the cold-hearted       peer, offended that the prayer was made in French, seized       their five principal men, who in their own land had been       persons of dignity and substance, and shipped them to       England, with the request that they might be kept from ever       again becoming troublesome by being consigned to service as       common sailors on board ships of war.\"    And so it was throughout:--\"We have been true,\" said they in one of  their petitions, \"to our religion, and true to ourselves; yet nature  appears to consider us only as the objects of public vengeance.\"--\"I  know not,\" writes Mr. Bancroft, \"if the annals of the human race keep  the records of wounds so wantonly inflicted, so bitter and so perennial  as fell upon the French inhabitants of Acadia.\"    American history has at least one element of peculiar character. The  voyage of the Pilgrim Fathers--the settlement of the Virginia  cavaliers--the foundation of Pennsylvania,--though all events of  profound moral interest, as well as productive of fine pictorial  effects, are not without parallels more or less close in the varied tale  of ancient and modern colonization. But that which is distinctive and  peculiar in the story of American civilization is, its struggle against  the Red Men. Settlers, it is true, have often found themselves in  strange company. In Africa the Greek colonizer elbowed the swarthy  Ethiop. In South America the Spaniard stood beside the Peruvian and the  Carib. Dutchmen have encountered the Malay and the Dyak. For two  centuries English settlers have had to deal with the uncivilized races  of the East and West--from the Bushmen of the Cape to the savages of New  Zealand. But none of these races present the same attractive features as  the brethren of the Iroquois and the Mohicans. About these latter there  are points of romantic and chivalric interest. Though not free from the  vices of the savage, they often exhibit virtues which might shame the  European. There is something of dignity in their aspect and bearing.  They are seldom without a natural and original poetic sense,--and their  language has a wild Ossianic music. They are bold in metaphor and apt in  natural illustration. A group of actors on the scene having  characteristics so peculiar and so attractive as the Red Skin is  invaluable to a historian whose tendency is to see events and note  character under their most pictorial aspects.    The part taken by the Indians in that war between the French and English  in America which ended in the conquest of Quebec and the expulsion of  the Lilies from Canada is narrated at great length by Mr. Bancroft,--and  the atrocious nature of the conflict is well brought out. At the  commencement of the war, we are allowed a glimpse at a curious  war-council:         \"'Brothers,' said the Delawares to the Miamis, 'we desire       the English and the Six Nations to put their hands upon your       heads, and keep the French from hurting you. Stand fast in       the chain of friendship with the Government of Virginia.'       'Brothers,' said the Miamis to the English, 'your country is       smooth; your hearts are good; the dwellings of your       governors are like the spring in its bloom.' 'Brothers,'       they added to the Six Nations, holding aloft a calumet       ornamented with feathers, 'the French and their Indians have       struck us, yet we kept this pipe unhurt;' and they gave it       to the Six Nations, in token of friendship with them and       with their allies. A shell and a string of black wampum were       given to signify the unity of heart; and that, though it was       darkness to the westward, yet towards the sun-rising it was       bright and clear. Another string of black wampum announced       that the war-chiefs and braves of the Miamis held the       hatchet in their hand, ready to strike the French. The       widowed Queen of the Piankeshaws sent a belt of black shells       intermixed with white. 'Brothers,' such were her words, 'I       am left a poor, lonely woman, with one son, whom I commend       to the English, the Six Nations, the Shawnees, and the       Delawares, and pray them to take care of him.' The Weas       produced a calumet. 'We have had this feathered pipe,' said       they, 'from the beginning of the world; so that when it       becomes cloudy, we can sweep the clouds away. It is dark in       the west, yet we sweep all clouds away towards the       sun-rising, and leave a clear and serene sky.' Thus, on the       alluvial lands of Western Ohio, began the contest that was       to scatter death broadcast through the world. All the       speeches were delivered again to the Deputies of the       Nations, represented at Logstown, that they might be       correctly repeated to the head Council at Onondaga. An       express messenger from the Miamis hurried across the       mountains, bearing to the shrewd and able Dinwiddie, the       Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, a belt of wampum, the scalp       of a French Indian, and a feathered pipe, with letters from       the dwellers on the Maumee and on the Wabash. 'Our good       brothers of Virginia,' said the former, 'we must look upon       ourselves as lost, if our brothers, the English, do not       stand by us and give us arms.' 'Eldest brother,' pleaded the       Picts and Windaws, 'this string of wampum assures you, that       the French King's servants have spilled our blood, and eaten       the flesh of three of our men. Look upon us and pity us, for       we are in great distress. Our chiefs have taken up the       hatchet of war. We have killed and eaten ten of the French       and two of their negroes. We are your brothers; and do not       think this is from our mouth only; it is from our very       hearts.' Thus they solicited protection and revenge.\"    The Duke of Newcastle was unequal to the task of driving the soldiers of  France from Canada or from the valley of the Mississippi. The North and  South were both in the hands of France. The route of the Ohio and the  Mississippi had been discovered by adventurers and missionaries of that  nation; and a few years of quiet possession of the territory would have  allowed French statesmen to consolidate their power in those regions,  and to draw a strong cordon around the entire group of English colonies  on the Atlantic sea-board. But Pitt's genius was brought to bear at a  critical moment on the arrangement of this great question--and he  conceived the project of breaking the Mississippi line and attacking the  enemy in their strongholds on the St. Lawrence. Three expeditions were  fitted out. Amherst and Wolfe were ordered to join the fleet under  Boscawen, destined to act against Louisburgh--Forbes was sent to the  Ohio Valley--Abercrombie was intrusted with the command against Crown  Point and Ticonderoga, though Lord Howe was sent out with the last named  as the real soul of the enterprise. Mr. Bancroft writes:         \"None of the officers won favor like Lord Howe and Wolfe.       Both were still young. To high rank and great connections       Howe added manliness, humanity, capacity to discern merit,       and judgment to employ it. As he reached America, he entered       on the simple austerity of forest warfare. James Wolfe, but       thirty-one years old, had already been eighteen years in the       army; was at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and had won laurels at       Laffeldt.

You know pretty well what Beauty and the Beast would be like  acted by four children who had spent the afternoon in arranging  their costumes and so had left no time for rehearsing what they had  to say. Yet it delighted them, and it charmed their audience. And  what more can any play do, even Shakespeare's? Mabel, in her  Princess clothes, was a resplendent Beauty; and Gerald a Beast  who wore the drawing-room hearthrugs with an air of  indescribable distinction. If Jimmy was not a talkative merchant,  he made it up with a stoutness practically unlimited, and Kathleen  surprised and delighted even herself by the quickness with which  she changed from one to the other of the minor characters fairies,  servants, and messengers. It was at the end of the second act that  Mabel, whose costume, having reached the height of elegance,  could not be bettered and therefore did not need to be changed,  said to Gerald, sweltering under the weighty magnificence of his  beast-skin:    \"I say, you might let us have the ring back.\"    \"I'm going to,\" said Gerald, who had quite forgotten it. \"I'll give it  you in the next scene. Only don't lose it, or go putting it on. You  might go out all together and never be seen again, or you might get  seven times as visible as anyone else, so that all the rest of us  would look like shadows beside you, you'd be so thick, or ,\"    \"Ready!\" said Kathleen, bustling in, once more a wicked sister.    Gerald managed to get his hand into his pocket under his  hearthrug, and when he rolled his eyes in agonies of sentiment, and  said, \"Farewell, dear Beauty! Return quickly, for if you remain  long absent from your faithful beast he will assuredly perish,\" he  pressed a ring into her hand and added: \"This is a magic ring that  will give you anything you wish. When you desire to return to your  own disinterested beast, put on the ring and utter your wish.  Instantly you will be by my side.\"    Beauty-Mabel took the ring, and it was the ring.    The curtains closed to warm applause from two pairs of hands.    The next scene went splendidly. The sisters were almost too  natural in their disagreeableness, and Beauty's annoyance when  they splashed her Princess's dress with real soap and water was  considered a miracle of good acting. Even the merchant rose to  something more than mere pillows, and the curtain fell on his  pathetic assurance that in the absence of his dear Beauty he was  wasting away to a shadow. And again two pairs of hands  applauded.    \"Here, Mabel, catch hold,\" Gerald appealed from under the weight  of a towel-horse, the tea-urn, the tea-tray, and the green baize  apron of the boot boy, which together with four red geraniums  from the landing, the pampas-grass from the drawing-room  fireplace, and the india-rubber plants from the drawing-room  window were to represent the fountains and garden of the last act.  The applause had died away.    \"I wish,\" said Mabel, taking on herself the weight of the tea-urn, \"I  wish those creatures we made were alive. We should get  something like applause then.\"    \"I'm jolly glad they aren't, said Gerald, arranging the baize and the  towel-horse. \"Brutes! It makes me feel quite silly when I catch  their paper eyes.\"    The curtains were drawn back. There lay the hearthrug-coated  beast, in flat abandonment among the tropic beauties of the  garden, the pampas-grass shrubbery, the india-rubber plant bushes,  the geranium-trees and the urn fountain. Beauty was ready to make  her great entry in all the thrilling splendour of despair. And then  suddenly it all happened.    Mademoiselle began it: she applauded the garden scene with  hurried little clappings of her quick French hands. Eliza's fat red  palms followed heavily, and then someone else was clapping, six  or seven people, and their clapping made a dull padded sound.  Nine faces instead of two were turned towards the stage, and seven  out of the nine were painted, pointed paper faces. And every hand  and every face was alive. The applause grew louder as Mabel  glided forward, and as she paused and looked at the audience her  unstudied pose of horror and amazement drew forth applause  louder still; but it was not loud enough to drown the shrieks of  Mademoiselle and Eliza as they rushed from the room, knocking  chairs over and crushing each other in the doorway. Two distant  doors banged, Mademoiselle's door and Eliza's door.    \"Curtain! curtain! quick!\" cried Beauty-Mabel, in a voice that  wasn't Mabel's or the Beauty's. \"Jerry those things have come alive.  Oh, whatever shall we do?\"    Gerald in his hearthrugs leaped to his feet. Again that flat padded  applause marked the swish of cloths on clothes-line as Jimmy and  Kathleen drew the curtains.    \"What's up?\" they asked as they drew.    \"You've done it this time!\" said Gerald to the pink, perspiring  Mabel. \"Oh, bother these strings!\"    \"Can't you burst them? I've done it?\" retorted Mabel. \"I like that!\"    \"More than I do,\" said Gerald.    \"Oh, it's all right,\" said Mabel. \"Come on. We must go and pull the  things to pieces then they can't go on being alive.\"    \"It's your fault, anyhow,\" said Gerald with every possible absence  of gallantry. \"Don't you see? It's turned into a wishing ring. I knew  something different was going to happen. Get my knife out of my  pocket this string's in a knot. Jimmy, Cathy, those Ugly-Wuglies  have come alive because Mabel wished it. Cut out and pull them to  pieces.\"    Jimmy and Cathy peeped through the curtain and recoiled with  white faces and staring eyes. \"Not me!\" was the brief rejoinder of  Jimmy. Cathy said, \"Not much!\" And she meant it, anyone could  see that.    And now, as Gerald, almost free of the hearthrugs, broke his  thumb-nail on the stiffest blade of his knife, a thick rustling and a  sharp, heavy stumping sounded beyond the curtain.    \"They're going out!\" screamed Kathleen \"walking out on their  umbrella and broomstick legs. You can't stop them, Jerry, they re  too awful!\"    \"Everybody in the town'll be insane by tomorrow night if we don't  stop them,\" cried Gerald. \"Here, give me the ring I'll unwish them.\"    He caught the ring from the unresisting Mabel, cried, \"I wish the  Uglies weren't alive,\" and tore through the door. He saw, in fancy,  Mabel's wish undone, and the empty hall strewed with limp  bolsters, hats, umbrellas, coats and gloves, prone abject properties  from which the brief life had gone out for ever. But the hall was  crowded with live things, strange things all horribly short as broom  sticks and umbrellas are short. A limp hand gesticulated. A pointed  white face with red cheeks looked up at him, and wide red lips  said something, he could not tell what. The voice reminded him of  the old beggar down by the bridge who had no roof to his mouth.  These creatures had no roofs to their mouths, of course they had no  \"Aa 00 re  o me me oo a oo ho el?\" said the voice again. And it had  said it four times before Gerald could collect himself sufficiently  to understand that this horror alive, and most likely quite  uncontrollable  was saying, with a dreadful calm, polite  persistence: \"Can you recommend me to a good hotel?\"    \"Can you recommend me to a good hotel?\" The speaker had no  inside to his head. Gerald had the best of reasons for knowing it.  The speaker's coat had no shoulders inside it only the cross-bar  that a jacket is slung on by careful ladies. The hand raised in  interrogation was not a hand at all; it was a glove lumpily stuffed  with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the arm attached to it was only  Kathleen's school umbrella. Yet the whole thing was alive, and  was asking a definite, and for anybody else, anybody who really  was a body, a reasonable question.    With a sensation of inward sinking, Gerald realized that now or  never was the time for him to rise to the occasion. And at the  thought he inwardly sank more deeply than before. It seemed  impossible to rise in the very smallest degree.    \"I beg your pardon\" was absolutely the best he could do; and the  painted, pointed paper face turned to him once more, and once  more said: \"Aa 00 re  o me me oo a oo ho el?\"    \"You want a hotel?\" Gerald repeated stupidly, \"a good hotel?\"    \"A oo ho el,\" reiterated the painted lips.    \"I'm awfully sorry,\" Gerald went on one can always be polite, of  course, whatever happens, and politeness came natural to him \"but  all our hotels shut so early about eight, I think.\"    \"Och em er,\" said the Ugly-Wugly. Gerald even now does not  understand how that practical joke hastily wrought of hat,  overcoat, paper face and limp hands could have managed, by just  being alive, to become perfectly respectable, apparently about fifty  years old, and obviously well known and respected in his own  suburb the kind of man who travels first class and smokes  expensive cigars. Gerald knew this time, without need of  repetition, that the Ugly-Wugly had said: \"Knock 'em up.\"    \"You can't,\" Gerald explained; \"they re all stone deaf every single  person who keeps a hotel in this town. It's,\" he wildly plunged \"it's  a County Council law. Only deaf people are allowed to keep  hotels. It's because of the hops in the beer,\" he found himself  adding; \"you know, hops are so good for ear-ache.\"    \"I 0 wy ollo oo,\" said the respectable Ugly-Wugly; and Gerald was  not surprised to find that the thing did \"not quite follow him.\"    \"It is a little difficult at first,\" he said. The other Ugly-Wuglies  were crowding round. The lady in the poke bonnet said Gerald  found he was getting quite clever at understanding the  conversation of those who had no roofs to their mouths:    \"If not a hotel, a lodging.\"    \"My lodging is on the cold ground,\" sang itself unbidden and  unavailing in Gerald's ear. Yet stay was it unavailing?    \"I "]]]
