This alone gives me the forces of  God wherewith to overcome all error. On this rests the    [Page 105.]    implicit faith engendered by Christian Science, which [1]  appeals intelligently to the facts of man's spirituality, in-  dividuality, to disdain the fears and destroy the discords  of this material personality.    On our Master's individual demonstrations over sin, [5]  sickness, and death, rested the anathema of priesthood  and the senses; yet this demonstration is the foundation  of Christian Science. His physical sufferings, which  came from the testimony of the senses, were over when  he resumed his individual spiritual being, after showing [10]  us the way to escape from the material body.    Science would have no conflict with Life or common  sense, if this sense were consistently sensible. Man's real  life or existence is in harmony with Life and its glorious  phenomena. It upholds being, and destroys the too [15]  common sense of its opposites--death, disease, and sin.  Christian Science is an everlasting victor, and vanquish-  ment is unknown to the omnipresent Truth. I must ever  follow this line of light and battle.    Christian Science is my only ideal; and the individual [20]  and his ideal can never be severed. If either is misunder-  stood or maligned, it eclipses the other with the shadow  cast by this error.    Truth destroys error. Nothing appears to the physi-  cal senses but their own subjective state of thought. The [25]  senses join issue with error, and pity what has no right  either to be pitied or to exist, and what does not exist in  Science. Destroy the thought of sin, sickness, death, and  you destroy their existence. \"Whatsoever a man soweth,  that shall he also reap.\" [30]    Because God is Mind, and this Mind is good, all  is good and all is Mind. God is the sum total of the    [Page 106.]    universe. Then what and where are sin, sickness, and [1]  death?    Christian Science and Christian Scientists will, _must_,  have a history; and if I could write the history in poor  parody on Tennyson's grand verse, it would read [5]  thus:--          Traitors to right of them,      M. D.'s to left of them,      Priestcraft in front of them,        Volleyed and thundered! [10]      Into the jaws of hate,      Out through the door of Love,      On to the blest above,        Marched the one hundred.          Extract From My First Address In The Mother Church, May 26, 1895      _Friends and Brethren_:--Your Sunday Lesson, com-  posed of Scripture and its correlative in \"Science and  Health with Key to the Scriptures,\" has fed you. In addi- [20]  tion, I can only bring crumbs fallen from this table of  Truth, and gather up the fragments.    It has long been a question of earnest import, How  shall mankind worship the most adorable, but most  unadored,--and where shall begin that praise that shall  never end? Beneath, above, beyond, methinks I hear [25]  the soft, sweet sigh of angels answering, \"So live, that  your lives attest your sincerity and resound His praise.\"    Music is the harmony of being; but the music of Soul  affords the only strains that thrill the chords of feeling  and awaken the heart's harpstrings. Moved by mind, [30]  your many-throated organ, in imitative tones of many    [Page 107.]    instruments, praises Him; but even the sweetness and [1]  beauty in and of this temple that praise Him, are earth's  accents, and must not be mistaken for the oracles of God.  Art must not prevail over Science. Christianity is not  superfluous. Its redemptive power is seen in sore trials, [5]  self-denials, and crucifixions of the flesh. But these come  to the rescue of mortals, to admonish them, and plant  the feet steadfastly in Christ. As we rise above the seem-  ing mists of sense, we behold more clearly that all the  heart's homage belongs to God. [10]    More love is the great need of mankind. A pure af-  fection, concentric, forgetting self, forgiving wrongs and  forestalling them, should swell the lyre of human love.    Three cardinal points must be gained before poor  humanity is regenerated and Christian Science is dem- [15]  onstrated: (1) A proper sense of sin; (2) repentance;  (3) the understanding of good. Evil is a negation: it  never started with time, and it cannot keep pace with  eternity. Mortals' false senses pass through three states  and stages of human consciousness before yielding error. [20]  The deluded sense must first be shown its falsity through  a knowledge of evil as evil, so-called. Without a sense  of one's oft-repeated violations of divine law, the in-  dividual may become morally blind, and this deplorable  mental state is moral idiocy. The lack of seeing one's [25]  deformed mentality, and of _repentance_ therefor, deep,  never to be repented of, is retarding, and in certain mor-  bid instances stopping, the growth of Christian Scientists.  Without a knowledge of his sins, and repentance so severe  that it destroys them, no person is or can be a Christian [30]  Scientist.    Mankind thinks either too much or too little of sin.    [Page 108.]    The sensitive, sorrowing saint thinks too much of it: the [1]  sordid sinner, or the so-called Christian asleep, thinks too  little of sin.    To allow sin of any sort is anomalous in Christian  Scientists, claiming, as they do, that good is infinite, All. [5]  Our Master, in his definition of Satan as a liar from the  beginning, attested the absolute powerlessness--yea,  nothingness--of evil: since a lie, being without founda-  tion in fact, is merely a falsity; spiritually, literally, it  _is nothing_. [10]    Not to know that a false claim is false, is to be in danger  of believing it; hence the utility of knowing evil aright,  then reducing its claim to its proper denominator,--  nobody and nothing. Sin should be conceived of only  as a delusion. This true conception would remove mortals' [15]  ignorance and its consequences, and advance the second  stage of human consciousness, repentance. The first  state, namely, the knowledge of one's self, the proper  knowledge of evil and its subtle workings wherein evil  seems as real as good, is indispensable; since that which [20]  is truly conceived of, we can handle; but the misconcep-  tion of what we need to know of evil,--or the concep-  tion of it at all as something real,--costs much. Sin  needs only to be known for what it is not; then we are  its master, not servant. Remember, and act on, Jesus' [25]  definition of sin as a _lie_. This cognomen makes it less  dangerous; for most of us would not be seen believing  in, or adhering to, that which we know to be untrue.  What would be thought of a Christian Scientist who be-  lieved in the use of drugs, while declaring that they have [30]  no intrinsic quality and that there is no matter? What  should be thought of an individual believing in that    [Page 109.]    which is untrue, and at the same time declaring the unity [1]  of Truth, and its allness? Beware of those who mis-  represent facts; or tacitly assent where they should dis-  sent; or who take me as authority for what I disapprove,  or mayhap never have thought of, and try to reverse, in- [5]  vert, or controvert, Truth; for this is a sure pretext of  moral defilement.    Examine yourselves, and see what, and how much, sin  claims of you; and how much of this claim you admit  as valid, or comply with. The knowledge of evil that [10]  brings on repentance is the most hopeful stage of mortal  mentality. Even a mild mistake must be seen as a mis-  take, in order to be corrected; how much more, then,  should one's sins be seen and repented of, before they  can be reduced to their native nothingness! [15]    Ignorance is only blest by reason of its nothingness;  for seeing the need of somethingness in its stead, blesses  mortals. Ignorance was the first condition of sin in the  allegory of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. Their  mental state is not desirable, neither is a knowledge of [20]  sin and its consequences, repentance, _per se_; but, ad-  mitting the existence of both, mortals must hasten through  the second to the third stage,--the knowledge of good;  for without this the valuable sequence of knowledge  would be lacking,--even the power to escape from the [25]  false claims of sin. To understand good, one must discern  the nothingness of evil, and consecrate one's life anew.    Beloved brethren, Christ, Truth, saith unto you, \"Be  not afraid!\"--fear not sin, lest thereby it master you;  but only _fear to sin_. Watch and pray for self-knowledge; [30]  since then, and thus, cometh repentance,--and your  superiority to a delusion is won.    [Page 110.]    Repentance is better than sacrifice. The costly balm [1]  of Araby, poured on our Master's feet, had not the value  of a single _tear_.    Beloved children, the world has need of you,--and  more as children than as men and women: it needs your [5]  innocence, unselfishness, faithful affection, uncontami-  nated lives. You need also to watch, and pray that you  preserve these virtues unstained, and lose them not through  contact with the world. What grander ambition is there  than to maintain in yourselves what Jesus loved, and to [10]  know that your example, more than words, makes morals  for mankind!          Address Before The Alumni Of The Massachusetts Metaphysical College, 1895      _My Beloved Students_:--Weeks have passed into [15]  months, and months into years, since last we met; but  time and space, when encompassed by divine presence,  do not separate us. Our hearts have kept time together,  and our hands have wrought steadfastly at the same  object-lesson, while leagues have lain between us. [20]    We may well unite in thanksgiving for the continued  progress and unprecedented prosperity of our Cause. It  is already obvious that the world's acceptance and the  momentum of Christian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#19)"],[1," hold of her and carried her up and down the country and thereby  \"wonne great credit.\"    [17] Darrel's account of this affair is in _A True Narration_ (_Somers  Tracts_, III), 179-186. Harsnett takes it up in his _Discovery_, 78-264.    [18] See deposition of Cooper, in Harsnett, _Discovery_, 114.    [19] Depositions of Somers and Darrel, _ibid._, 124-125. It must be  recalled that when this was first tried before a commission they were  convinced that it was not imposture. A layman cannot refrain from  suspecting that Darrel had hypnotic control over Somers.    [20] _Ibid._, 141-142.    [21] _Ibid._, 141. Harsnett quotes Darrel for this statement.

[30] _Ibid._, 320-322; Darrel, _An Apologie, or defence_, L III, says  that the third jury acquitted her. Harsnett refers to the fact that he  was found guilty by the grand inquest.    [31] _The Triall of Maist. Dorrel_, preface \"To the Reader.\"    [32] Harsnett, _Discovery_, 9.    [33] _Ibid._, 78-98.    [34] Yet Darrel must have realized that he had the worst of it. There is  a pathetic acknowledgment of this in the \"Preface to the Reader\" of his  publication, _A Survey of Certaine Dialogical Discourses, written by  John Deacon and John Walker ..._ (1602): \"But like a tried and  weather-beaten bird [I] wish for quiet corner to rest myself in and to  drye my feathers in the warme sun.\"    [35] T. G. Law, \"Devil Hunting in Elizabethan England,\" in _Nineteenth  Century_, March, 1894.    [36] On the matter of exorcism the position of the Church of England  became fixed by 1604. The question had been a cause of disagreement  among the leaders of the Reformation. The Lutherans retained exorcism in  the baptismal ritual and rivalled the Roman clergy in their exorcism of  the possessed. It was just at the close of the sixteenth century that  there arose in Lutheran Germany a hot struggle between the believers in  exorcism and those who would oust it as a superstition. The Swiss and  Genevan reformers, unlike Luther, had discarded exorcism, declaring it  to have belonged only to the early church, and charging modern instances  to Papist fraud; and with them seem to have agreed their South German  friends. In England baptismal exorcism was at first retained in the  ritual under Edward VI, but in 1552, under Bucer's influence, it was  dropped. Under Elizabeth the yet greater influence of Zurich and Geneva  must have discredited all exorcism, and one finds abundant evidence of  this in the writings of Jewel and his followers. An interesting letter  of Archbishop Parker in 1574 shows his utter incredulity as to  possession in the case of Agnes Bridges and Rachel Pinder of Lothbury;  see Parker's _Correspondence_ (Parker Soc., Cambridge, 1856), 465-466.  His successor, the Calvinistic Whitgift, was almost certainly of the  same mind. Bancroft, the next archbishop of Canterbury, drew up or at  least inspired that epoch-making body of canons enacted by Convocation  in the spring of 1604, the 72d article of which forbids any Anglican  clergyman, without the express consent of his bishop obtained  beforehand, to use exorcism in any fashion under any pretext, on pain of  being counted an impostor and deposed from the ministry. This ended the  matter so far as the English church was concerned. For this resume of  the Protestant and the Anglican attitude toward exorcism I am indebted  to Professor Burr.    [37] Harsnett, _A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_ (London,  1605), 136-138.    [38] It is not impossible that Harsnett was acting as a mouth-piece for  Bancroft. Darrel wrote: \"There is no doubt but that S. H. stand for  Samuell Harsnet, chapline to the Bishop of London, but whither he alone,  or his lord and hee, have discovered this counterfeyting and cosonage  there is the question. Some thinke the booke to be the Bishops owne  doing: and many thinke it to be the joynt worke of them both.\" _A  Detection of that sinnful ... discours of Samuel Harshnet_, 7, 8.    [39] From 1602 until 1609 he was archdeacon of Essex; see _Victoria  History of Essex_, II, (London, 1907), 46.    [40] There is a statement by the Reverend John Swan, who wrote in 1603,  that Harsnett's book had been put into the hands of King James,  presumably after his coming to England; see John Swan, _A True and  Breife Report of Mary Glover's Vexation, and of her deliverance ..._  (1603), \"Dedication to the King,\" 3. One could wish for some  confirmation of this statement. Certainly James would not at that time  have sympathized with Harsnett's views about witches, but his attitude  on several occasions toward those supposed to be possessed by evil  spirits would indicate that he may very well have been influenced by a  reading of the _Discovery_.    [41] On page 36 of the _Discovery_ Harsnett wrote: \"Whether witches can  send devils into men and women (as many doe pretende) is a question  amongst those that write of such matters, and the learneder and sounder  sort doe hold the negative.\" One does not need to read far in Harsnett  to understand what he thought.    [42] His scholarship, evident from his books, is attested by Thomas  Fuller, who calls him \"a man of great learning, strong parts, and stout  spirit\" (_Worthies of England_, ed. of London, 1840, I, 507).    [43] See his _Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_, 134-136; his  _Discovery_ also shows the use of Scot.    [44] Harsnett, _Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_, 98, 123,  110.

JAMES I AND WITCHCRAFT.      Some one has remarked that witchcraft came into England with the Stuarts  and went out with them. This offhand way of fixing the rise and fall of  a movement has just enough truth about it to cause misconception.  Nothing is easier than to glance at the alarms of Elizabeth's reign and  to see in them accidental outbreaks with little meaning, isolated  affairs presaging a new movement rather than part of it. As a matter of  fact, any such view is superficial. In previous chapters the writer has  endeavored to show just how foreign ideas and conditions at home gave  the impulse to a movement which within a single reign took very definite  form.    Yet so much was the movement accelerated, such additional impetus was  given it by James I, that the view that James set the superstition going  in England, however superficial, has some truth in it. If Elizabeth had  ever given the matter thought, she had not at least given it many words.  James had very definite opinions on the subject and hesitated not at all  to make them known. His views had weight. It is useless to deny that the  royal position swayed the courts. James's part in the witch persecution  cannot be condoned, save on the ground that he was perfectly honest. He  felt deeply on the matter. It was little wonder. He had grown up in  Scotland in the very midst of the witch alarms. His own life, he  believed, had been imperilled by the machinations of witches. He  believed he had every reason to fear and hate the creatures, and we can  only wonder that he was so moderate as we shall later find him to have  been. The story of the affair that stirred up the Scottish king and his  people has often been told, but it must be included here to make his  attitude explicable. In 1589 he had arranged for a marriage with the  Princess Anne of Denmark. The marriage had been performed by proxy in  July, and it was then provided that the princess was to come to England.  She set out, but was driven on to the coast of Norway by a violent  storm, and detained there by the continuance of the storms. James sailed  to Upsala, and, after a winter in the north of the Continent, brought  his bride to Scotland in the spring, not without encountering more rough  weather. To the people of the time it was quite clear that the ocean was  unfriendly to James's alliance. Had Scotland been ancient Greece, no  doubt Neptune would have been propitiated by a sacrifice. But it was  Scotland, and the ever-to-be-feared Satan was not so easily propitiated.  He had been very active of late in the realm.    Moreover it was a time when Satanic and other conspiracies were likely  to come to light. The kingdom was unsettled, if not discontented. There  were plots, and rumors of plots. The effort to expose them, as well as  to thwart the attacks of the evil one on the king, led to the conception  and spread of the monstrous story of the conspiracy of Dr. Fian. Dr.  Fian was nothing less than a Scottish Dr. Faustus. He was a schoolmaster  by profession. After a dissolute youth he was said to have given soul to  the Devil. According to the story he gathered around him a motley crowd,  Catholic women of rank, \"wise women,\" and humble peasant people; but it  was a crew ready for evil enterprise. It is not very clear why they were  supposed to have attacked the king; perhaps because of his well known  piety, perhaps because he was a Protestant. In any case they set about,  as the story went, to destroy him, and thought to have found their  opportunity in his trip to Denmark. They would drown him in a storm at  sea. There was a simple expedient for raising a storm, the throwing of  cats into the sea."]]]
