(#19)"],[1," long undulating wave of light rolls off from your oar as you lift it  from the water. On a brilliant evening this effect is lost in a great  degree, and it is not until you dip your net fairly under the moonlit  surface of the sea, that you are aware how full of life it is.  Occasionally one is tempted out by the brilliancy of the  phosphorescence, when the clouds are so thick that water, sky, and  land become one indiscriminate mass of black, and the line of rocks  can be discerned only by the vivid flash of greenish golden light,  when the breakers dash against them. At such times there is something  wild and weird in the whole scene, which at once fascinates and  appalls the imagination; one seems to be rocking above a volcano, for  the surface around is intensely black, except where fitful flashes or  broad waves of light break from the water under the motion of the boat  or the stroke of the oars. It was on a night like this, when the  phosphorescence was unusually brilliant, and the sea as black as ink,  the surf breaking heavily and girdling the rocky shore with a wall of  fire, that our collector was so fortunate as to find in the rich  harvest he brought home the entirely new and exceedingly pretty little  floating Hydroid, described under the name of Nanomia (Fig. 115). It  was in its very infancy (Fig. 108), a mere bubble, not yet possessed  of the various appendages which eventually make up its complex  structure; but it was nevertheless very important to have seen it in  this early stage of its existence, since, when a few full-grown  specimens were found in the autumn, which lived for some days in  confinement and quietly allowed their portraits to be taken (see Fig.  115), it was easy to connect the adult animal with the younger phase  of its own life and thus make a complete history.    Marine phosphorescence is no new topic, and we have dwelt too long,  perhaps, upon a phenomenon that every voyager has seen, and many have  described. Its effect is very different, when seen from the deck of a  vessel, from its appearance as one floats through its midst,  distinguishing the very creatures that produce it, and any account of  the Medusae which did not include this most characteristic feature  would be incomplete.           *       *       *       *       *          ECHINODERMS.      Our illustrations and descriptions of Echinoderms are scanty in  comparison to those of the preceding class; for while, in consequence,  perhaps, of the combined influence of the Gulf Stream and the cold  arctic current on the New England shore, Acalephs are largely  represented in our waters, our marine fauna is meagre in Echinoderms.  But although we have few varieties, those which do establish  themselves on a coast seemingly so ungenial for others of their kind,  such as the Echinus, and our common Star-fish, for instance, thrive  well and are very abundant. The class of Echinoderms includes five  orders, viz. CRINOIDS, OPHIURANS, STAR-FISHES, SEA-URCHINS, and  HOLOTHURIANS. The animals composing these orders differ so widely in  appearance that it was very long before their true relations were  detected, and it was seen that all their external differences were  united under a common plan. Let us compare, for instance, the  worm-like Holothurians (Figs. 124, 126, 127) with all the host of  Star-fishes (Figs. 142, 146, 147) and Sea-urchins (Figs. 131, 139), or  compare the radiating form of the Star-fish, its arms spreading in  every direction, with the close spherical outline of the Sea-urchin,  or the Crinoid floating at the end of a stem (Fig. 152) with either of  these, and we shall cease to wonder that naturalists failed to find at  once a unity of idea under all these varieties of execution. And yet  the fundamental structure of the class of Echinoderms is represented  as distinctly by any one of its five orders as by any other, and is  absolutely identical in all. They differ only by trifling  modifications of development.    In Echinoderms as a class, the body presents three regions differing  in structure, and on the greater or less development of these regions  or systems, as we may call them, their chief differences are based.  Take, for instance, the dorsal system, the nature of which is  explained by the name, indicating of course the back of the animal,  though it does not necessarily imply the upper side of the body, since  some of the Echinoderms, as the stemmed Crinoids, for example, carry  the dorsal side downward, while the Star-fishes and Sea-urchins carry  it upward, and the Holothurians, moving with the mouth forward, have  the dorsal system at the opposite end of the body. Whatever the  natural attitude of the animal, however, and the consequent position  of the dorsal region, it exists alike in all the five orders, though  it has not the same extent and importance in each. But in all it is  made up of similar parts, bears the same relation to the rest of the  body, has the same share in the general economy of the animal. And  though when we compare the spreading back of a Star-fish with the  small area on the top of a Sea-urchin, where all the zones unite, we  may not at once see the correspondence between them, yet a careful  comparison of all their structural details shows that they are both  built with the same elements and represent the same region, though it  is stretched to the utmost in the one case, and greatly contracted in  the other.    This being true of the dorsal system, let us look at another equally  important structural feature in this class. All Echinoderms have  locomotive organs peculiar to themselves, a kind of suckers which may  be more or less numerous, larger or smaller, in different species, but  are always appendages of the same character. These are variously  distributed over the body, but always with a certain regularity  occupying definite spaces, shown by investigation to be homologous in  all. For instance, the rays of the Star-fish correspond in every  detail on their under side, along which the locomotive suckers run,  with the zones on the Sea-urchin, from end to end of which the suckers  are arranged; and the same is equally true of the distribution of the  suckers on the Holothurians, Ophiurans, and Crinoids, though, as most  persons are less familiar with these orders than with the other two,  it might not be so easy to point out the coincidence to our readers.  These suckers are called the ambulacra, the lines along which they run  are called the ambulacral rows or zones, while the system of  locomotion as a whole is known as the ambulacral system. Since these  organs are thus regularly distributed over the body in distinct zones  or rows, it follows that the latter must be divided by intervening  spaces. These intervals are called the interambulacral spaces; but  while in some orders they are occupied by larger plates and prominent  spines, as in the Sea-urchin and Star-fish, in others they are either  comparatively insignificant or completely suppressed, as in the  Crinoids and Ophiurans. Such are the three regions or systems which by  their greater or less development introduce an almost infinite variety  of combinations into this highest class of Radiates. It may not be  amiss before proceeding further to compare the five orders with  reference to this point, and see which of these three systems has the  preponderance in each one.    Taking the orders in their rank and beginning with the lowest, we find  in the Crinoids that the dorsal system preponderates, being composed  of highly complicated plates, and developed to such a degree as to  form in many instances a stem by which the animal is attached to the  ground, while the ambulacral system is limited to a comparatively  small area, and the interambulacral system is wanting. The order of  Crinoids has diminished so much in modern geological times that we  must consult its fossil forms in order to understand fully the  peculiar adaptation of the Echinoderm plan in this group.    In the Ophiurans, the dorsal system is still large, and though it no  longer stretches out to form a stem, it folds over on the under side  of the animal so as to enclose entirely the ambulacral system, forming  a kind of shield for the arms. Here also the interambulacral system is  wanting.    In the Star-fishes the dorsal system encroaches less upon the  structure of the animal. The back and oral side here correspond  exactly in size, and though the flat leathery upper surface of the  animal, covered with spines, serves as a protection to the delicate  ambulacral suckers which find their way between the rows of small  plates along the under side of the arms, yet it does not enfold them  as in the Ophiurans. On the contrary, in the Star-fishes the  ambulacral rows are protected on either side by a row of the so-called  interambulacral plates, through which no suckers pass.    In the Sea-urchin, the dorsal system is contracted to a minimum,  forming a small area on the top of the animal, the rows of  interambulacral plates which are separated and lie on either side of  the ambulacra in the Star-fish being united in the Sea-urchin, and  both the ambulacral and the interambulacral systems bent upward,  meeting in the small dorsal area above, so as to form a spherical  outline. Here the ambulacral and interambulacral systems have taken a  great preponderance over the dorsal system, and the same is the case  with the Holothurians, in which the same structure is greatly  elongated, the dorsal system being thus pushed out as it were to the  end of a cylinder, while the ambulacral and interambulacral systems  run along its whole length. All Echinoderms without exception have  ambulacral tubes, even though in some there are no external ambulacral  suckers connected with them.    There is one organ peculiar to the class of Echinoderms, the general  structure of which may be described here, since it is common to them  all, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35514"],[0,"The Great Apostasy, Considered in the Light of Scriptural and Secular History (#19)"],[1,"of their station, abandoned themselves to the indolence and  delicacy of an effeminate and luxurious life. The deacons, beholding  the presbyters deserting thus their functions, boldly usurped their  rights and privileges, and the effects of a corrupt ambition were  spread through every rank of the order sacred.\"--(Mosheim,  \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Cent. III, Part II, ch. 2:3, 4.)          CHAPTER VII.    **Internal Causes.--Continued**.      1. First among the specific causes of disturbance operating within the  Church, and contributing to its apostasy, we have named: \"_The  corrupting of the simple principles of the gospel by the admixture of  the so-called philosophic systems of the times_.\"    2. The attempted grafting of foreign doctrines on the true vine of the  gospel of Christ was characteristic of the early years of the  apostolic period. We read of the sorcerer Simon, who professed belief  and entered the Church by baptism, but who was so devoid of the true  spirit of the gospel that he sought to purchase by money the authority  and power of the priesthood.--(See Acts 8:9, 13, 18-24.) This man,  though rebuked by Peter, and apparently penitent, continued to trouble  the Church, by inculcating heresies and winning disciples within the  fold. His followers were distinguished as a sect or cult down to the  fourth century; and, writing at that time, Eusebius says of them:  \"These, after the manner of their founder, insinuating themselves into  the Church, like a pestilential and leprous disease, infected those  with the greatest corruption, into whom they were able to infuse their  secret, irremediable, and destructive poison.\"--(Eusebius,  \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Book II, ch. 1.) This Simon, known in  history as Simon Magus, is referred to by early Christian writers, as  the founder of heresy, owing to his persistent attempts to combine  Christianity with Gnosticism. It is with reference to his proposition  to purchase spiritual authority that all traffic in spiritual offices  has come to be known as simony.    3. Through the mouth of the Revelator, the Lord reproved certain of  the churches for their adoption or toleration of doctrines and  practices alien to the gospel. Notably is this the case with respect  to the Nicolaitanes, and the followers of the doctrines of  Balaam.--(See Rev. 2:15; compare verse 6; see also verse 20. See Note  1, end of chapter.)    4. The perversion of true theology thus developed within the Church is  traceable to the introduction of both Judaistic and pagan  fallacies.--(See Note 2, end of chapter.) Indeed, at the opening of  the Christian era and for centuries thereafter, Judaism was more or  less intimately mixed with pagan philosophy, and contaminated with  heathen ceremonies. There were numerous sects and parties, cults and  schools, each advocating rival theories as to the constitution of the  soul, the essence of sin, the nature of Deity, and a multitude of  other mysteries. The Christians were soon embroiled in endless  controversies among themselves.    5. Judaistic converts to Christianity sought to modify and adapt the  tenets of the new faith so as to harmonize them with their inherited  love of Judaism, and the result was destructive to both. Our Lord had  indicated the futility of any such attempts to combine new principle  with old systems, or to patch up the prejudices of the past with  fragments of new doctrine. \"No man,\" said He, \"putteth a piece of new  cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up  taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. Neither do men  put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine  runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new  bottles, and both are preserved.\"--(Matt. 9:16, 17.) The gospel came  as a new revelation, marking the fulfilment of the law, it was no mere  addendum, nor was it a simple reenactment of past requirements; it  embodied a new and an everlasting covenant. Attempts to patch the  Judaistic robe with the new fabric of the gospel could result in  nothing more sightly than a hideous rent. The new wine of the covenant  could not be bottled in the time-eaten leathern containers of Mosaic  libations. Judaism was belittled and Christianity perverted by the  incongruous association.    6. Among the early and most pernicious adulterations of Christian  doctrine is the introduction of the teachings of the Gnostics. These  self-styled philosophers put forth the boastful claim that they were  able to lead the human mind to a full comprehension of the Supreme  Being, and a knowledge of the true relationship between Deity and  mortals. They said in effect that a certain being had existed from all  eternity, manifested as a radiant light diffused throughout space, and  this they called the _Pleroma_. \"The eternal nature, infinitely  perfect and infinitely happy, having dwelt from everlasting in a  profound solitude, and in a blessed tranquillity produced at length  from itself, two minds of a different sex, which resembled their  supreme parent in the most perfect manner. From the prolific union of  these two beings, others arose, which were also followed by succeeding  generations; so that in process of time a celestial family was formed  in the Pleroma. This divine progeny, immutable in its nature, and  above the power of mortality, was called, by the philosophers,  _Aeon_--a term which signifies, in the Greek language, an eternal  nature. How many in number these Aeons were was a point much  controverted among the oriental sages.\"--(Mosheim, \"Ecclesiastical  History,\" Cent. I, Part II, 1:7.)    7. Then one of the Aeons, distinctively called the Demiurge, created  this world, and arrogantly asserted dominion over the same, denying  absolutely the authority of the supreme parent. The Gnostic doctrine  declares man to be a union of the body, which, being the creation of  the Demiurge, is essentially evil, and a spirit, which, being derived  from Deity, is characteristically good. The spirits thus imprisoned in  evil bodies will be finally liberated, and then the power of the  Demiurge will cease, and the earth will be dissolved into nothingness.    8. Our justification for introducing here this partial summary of  Gnosticism is the fact that early efforts were made to accommodate the  tenets of this system to the demands of Christianity; and that Christ  and the Holy Ghost were declared to belong to the family of Aeons  provided for in this scheme. This led to the extravagant absurdity of  denying that Jesus had a body even while He lived as a man; and that  His appearance as a corporeal being was a deception of the senses  wrought by His supernatural power.--(See Note 3, end of chapter.)    9. That the doctrines of the Gnostics were unsatisfying even to those  who professed to believe therein is evident from the many cults and  parties that came into existence as subdivisions of the main sect; and  it is interesting to note that in modern times certain free-thinkers  have prided themselves in assuming a title expressing the full  antithesis of the name Gnostics, viz. Agnostics.    10. The practical effect of the principles of Gnosticism in the lives  of its adherents is strangely diverse. One division of the sect  followed a life of austerity, embracing rigorous self-denial, and  bodily torture, in the vain belief that the malignant body could thus  be subdued, while the spirit would be given added power and increased  freedom. Another cult sought to minimize the fundamental difference  between right and wrong, by denying the element of morality in human  life; and these abandoned themselves to the impulses of the passions  and the frailties of the bodily nature without restraint, on the  assumption that there was no such relation between body and soul as  would cause injury to the latter through bodily indulgences and  excesses.    11. Another sect or school whose doctrines were in a measure  amalgamated with those of Christianity was that of the New Platonics.  The ancient sects of Platonists or Platonics were allied in some  points of doctrine with the Epicureans, and were rivals if not  opponents of the Stoics. The early Platonics held that unorganized  matter has existed from all eternity, and that its organizer, God, is  similarly eternal. As God is eternal, so also His will or intelligence  is without beginning, and this eternal intelligence existing as the  will or intent of Deity, was called the _Logos_. Such precepts had  been taught long before the Christian era, and the philosophy  professed by some of the contending sects among the Jews in the time  of Christ had been influenced thereby.    12. As the principles of Christianity became generally known, certain  leaders in the sect of Platonics found in the new doctrine much to  study and admire. By this time, however, Platonism itself had  undergone much change, and the more liberal adherents had formed a new  organization and distinguished themselves by the appellation New  Platonics. These professed to find in Jesus Christ the incarnation of  the Logos, and accepted with avidity the declaration of St. John: \"In  the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word  was God. * * * And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among  us.\"--(John 1:1, 14.) According to the Eclectic or New Platonic  philosophy, the \"Word\" referred to by St. John was the \"Logos\"  described by Plato.    13. The Platonic conception of the Godhead as consisting of the Deity  and the Logos, was enlarged in accordance with Christian tenets to  embrace three members, the Holy Ghost being the third. Thence arose  bitter and lasting dissension as to the relative powers of each member  of the Trinity, particularly the position and authority of the Logos  or Son. The many disputes incident to the admixture of Platonic theory  with Christian doctrine continued through the centuries, and in a  sense may "]]]
