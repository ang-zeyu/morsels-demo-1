Those who saw the flames of Genius devour the old worm-eaten crumbling  skeletons, attached themselves to the musical school of which the most  gifted, the most brilliant, the most daring representative, was Berlioz.  Chopin joined this school. He persisted most strenuously in freeing  himself from the servile formulas of conventional style, while he  earnestly repudiated the charlatanism which sought to replace the old  abuses only by the introduction of new ones.    During the years which this campaign of Romanticism lasted, in which  some of the trial blows were master-strokes, Chopin remained invariable  in his predilections, as well as in his repulsions. He did not admit the  least compromise with those who, in his opinion, did not sufficiently  represent progress, and who, in their refusal to relinquish the desire  of displaying art for the profit of the trade, in their pursuit of  transitory effects, of success won only from the astonishment of the  audience, gave no proof of sincere devotion to progress. He broke the  ties which he had contracted with respect when he felt restricted by  them, or bound too closely to the shore by cordage which he knew to be  decayed. He obstinately refused, on the other hand, to form ties with  the young artists whose success, which he deemed exaggerated, elevated a  certain kind of merit too highly. He never gave the least praise to any  thing which he did not believe to be a real conquest for art, or which  did not evince a serious conception of the task of an artist. He did  not wish to be lauded by any party, to be aided by the manoeuvres of  any faction, or by the concessions made by any schools in the persons  of their chiefs. In the midst of jealousies, encroachments, forfeitures,  and invasions of the different branches of art, negotiations, treaties,  and contracts have been introduced, like the means and appliances of  diplomacy, with all the artifices inseparable from such a course. In  refusing the support of any accessory aid for his productions, he proved  that he confidently believed that their own beauty would ensure their  appreciation, and that he did not struggle to facilitate their immediate  reception.    He supported our struggles, at that time so full of uncertainty, when we  met more sages shaking their heads, than glorious adversaries, with his  calm and unalterable conviction. He aided us with opinions so fixed  that neither weariness nor artifice could shake them, with a rare  immutability of will, and that efficacious assistance which the creation  of meritorious works always brings to a struggling cause, when it can  claim them as its own. He mingled so many charms, so much moderation, so  much knowledge with his daring innovations, that the prompt admiration  he inspired fully justified the confidence he placed in his own genius.  The solid studies which he had made, the reflective habits of his youth,  the worship for classic models in which he had been educated, preserved  him from losing his strength in blind gropings, in doubtful triumphs,  as has happened to more than one partisan of the new ideas. His studious  patience in the elaboration of his works sheltered him from the  critics, who envenomed the dissensions by seizing upon those easy  and insignificant victories due to omissions, and the negligence of  inadvertence. Early trained to the exactions and restrictions of rules,  having produced compositions filled with beauty when subjected to all  their fetters, he never shook them off without an appropriate cause and  after due reflection. In virtue of his principles he always progressed,  but without being led into exaggeration or lured by compromise; he  willingly relinquished theoretic formulas to pursue their results.  Less occupied with the disputes of the schools and their terms, than in  producing himself the best argument, a finished work, he was fortunate  enough to avoid personal enmities and vexatious accommodations.    Chopin had that reverential worship for art which characterized the  first masters of the middle ages, but in expression and bearing he was  more simple, modern, and less ecstatic. As for them, so art was for him,  a high and holy vocation. Like them he was proud of his election for it,  and honored it with devout piety. This feeling was revealed at the hour  of his death through an occurrence, the significance of which is more  fully explained by a knowledge of the manners prevalent in Poland. By a  custom which still exists, although it is now falling into disuse, the  Poles often chose the garments in which they wished to be buried,  and which were frequently prepared a long time in advance. [Footnote:  General K----, the author of Julie and Adolphe, a romance imitated from  the New Heloise which was much in vogue at the time of its publication,  and who was still living in Volhynia at the date of our visit to Poland,  though more than eighty years of age, in conformity with the custom  spoken of above, had caused his coffin to be made, and for more than  thirty years it had always stood at the door of his chamber.] Their  dearest wishes were thus expressed for the last time, their inmost  feelings were thus at the hour of death betrayed. Monastic robes were  frequently chosen by worldly men, the costumes of official charges  were selected or refused as the remembrances connected with them  were glorious or painful. Chopin, who, although among the first  of contemporary artists, had given the fewest concerts, wished,  notwithstanding, to be borne to the grave in the clothes which he had  worn on such occasions. A natural and profound feeling springing from  the inexhaustible sources of art, without doubt dictated this dying  request, when having scrupulously fulfilled the last duties of a  Christian, he left all of earth which he could not bear with him to  the skies. He had linked his love for art and his faith in it with  immortality long before the approach of death, and as he robed himself  for his long sleep in the grave, he gave, as was customary with him,  by a mute symbol, the last touching proof of the conviction he had  preserved intact during the whole course of his life. Faithful to  himself, he died adoring art in its mystic greatness, its highest  revelations.    In retiring from the turmoil of society, Chopin concentrated his  cares and affections upon the circle of his own family and his early  acquaintances. Without any interruption he preserved close relations  with them; never ceasing to keep them up with the greatest care. His  sister Louise was especially dear to him, a resemblance in the character  of their minds, the bent of their feelings, bound them closely to each  other. Louise frequently came from Warsaw to Paris to see him. She spent  the last three months of his life with the brother she loved, watching  over him with undying affection. Chopin kept up a regular correspondence  with the members of his own family, but only with them. It was one of  his peculiarities to write letters to no others; it might almost have  been thought that he had made a vow to write to no strangers. It was  curious enough to see him resort to all kinds of expedients to escape  the necessity of tracing the most insignificant note. Many times he has  traversed Paris from one end to the other, to decline an invitation to  dinner, or to give some trivial information, rather than write a few  lines which would have spared him all this trouble and loss of time. His  handwriting was quite unknown to the greatest number of his friends. It  is said he sometimes departed from this custom in favor of his beautiful  countrywomen, some of whom possess several of his notes written in  Polish. This infraction of what seemed to be a law with him, may be  attributed to the pleasure he took in the use of this language.  He always used it with the people of his own country, and loved to  translate its most expressive phrases. He was a good French scholar,  as the Sclaves generally are. In consequence of his French origin, the  language had been taught him with peculiar care. But he did not like  it, he did not think it sufficiently sonorous, and he deemed its genius  cold. This opinion is very prevalent among the Poles, who, although  speaking it with great facility, often better than their native tongue,  and frequently using it in their intercourse with each other, yet  complain to those who do not speak Polish of the impossibility of  rendering the thousand ethereal and shifting modes of thought in any  other idiom. In their opinion it is sometimes dignity, sometimes grace,  sometimes passion, which is wanting in the French language. If they are  asked the meaning of a word or a phrase which they may have cited in  Polish, the reply invariably is: \"Oh, that cannot be translated!\" Then  follow explanations, serving as comments to the exclamation, of all the  subtleties, all the shades of meaning, all the delicacies contained  in THE NOT TO BE TRANSLATED words. We have cited some examples which,  joined to others, induce us to believe that this language has the  advantage of making images of abstract nouns, and that in the course of  its development, through the poetic genius of the nation, it has been  enabled to establish striking and just relations between ideas by  etymologies, derivations, and synonymes. Colored reflections of light  and shade are thus thrown upon all expressions, so that they necessarily  call into vibration through the mind the correspondent tone of a third,  which modulates"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],[0,"Roughing It in the Bush (#19)"],[1," this way; but,  fortunately for us, the arrival of an English family in our  immediate vicinity drew off the attention of our neighbours  in that direction, and left us time to recover a little from  their persecutions.    This system of borrowing is not wholly confined to the poor and  ignorant; it pervades every class of society. If a party is given in  any of the small villages, a boy is sent round from house to house,  to collect all the plates and dishes, knives and forks, teaspoons  and candlesticks, that are presentable, for the use of the company.    During my stay at the hotel, I took a dress out of my trunk, and  hung it up upon a peg in my chamber, in order to remove the creases  it had received from close packing. Returning from a walk in the  afternoon, I found a note upon my dressing table, inviting us to  spend the evening with a clergyman's family in the village; and as  it was nearly time to dress, I went to the peg to take down my gown.  Was it a dream?--the gown was gone. I re-opened the trunk, to see if  I had replaced it; I searched every corner of the room, but all in  vain; nowhere could I discover the thing I sought. What had become  of it? The question was a delicate one, which I did not like to put  to the young ladies of the truly respectable establishment; still,  the loss was great, and at that moment very inconvenient. While I  was deliberating on what course to pursue, Miss S---- entered the  room.    \"I guess you missed your dress,\" she said, with a smile.    \"Do you know where it is?\"    \"Oh, sure. Miss L----, the dressmaker, came in just after you left.  She is a very particular friend of mine, and I showed her your  dress. She admired it above all things, and borrowed it, to get the  pattern for Miss R----'s wedding dress. She promised to return it  to-morrow.\"    \"Provoking! I wanted it to-night. Who ever heard of borrowing a  person's dress without the leave of the owner? Truly, this is a  free-and-easy country!\"    One very severe winter night, a neighbour borrowed of me a  blanket--it was one of my best--for the use of a stranger who was  passing the night at her house. I could not well refuse; but at that  time, the world pressed me sore, and I could ill spare it. Two years  elapsed, and I saw no more of my blanket; at length I sent a note to  the lady, requesting it to be returned. I got a very short answer  back, and the blanket, alas! worn threadbare; the borrower stating  that she had sent the article, but really she did not know what to  do without it, as she wanted it to cover the children's bed. She  certainly forgot that I, too, had children, who wanted covering as  well as her own. But I have said so much of the ill results of  others' borrowing, that I will close this sketch by relating my own  experience in this way.    After removing to the bush, many misfortunes befel us, which  deprived us of our income, and reduced us to great poverty. In fact  we were strangers, and the knowing ones took us in; and for many  years we struggled with hardships which would have broken stouter  hearts than ours, had not our trust been placed in the Almighty,  who among all our troubles never wholly deserted us.    While my husband was absent on the frontier during the rebellion,  my youngest boy fell very sick, and required my utmost care, both  by night and day. To attend to him properly, a candle burning  during the night was necessary. The last candle was burnt out;  I had no money to buy another, and no fat from which I could make  one. I hated borrowing; but, for the dear child's sake, I overcame  my scruples, and succeeded in procuring a candle from a good  neighbour, but with strict injunctions (for it was _her last_),  that I must return it if I did not require it during the night.    I went home quite grateful with my prize. It was a clear moonlight  night--the dear boy was better, so I told old Jenny, my Irish  servant, to go to bed, as I would lie down in my clothes by the  child, and if he were worse I would get up and light the candle. It  happened that a pane of glass was broken out of the window frame,  and I had supplied its place by fitting in a shingle; my friend  Emilia S---- had a large Tom-cat, who, when his mistress was absent,  often paid me a predatory or borrowing visit; and Tom had a practice  of pushing in this wooden pane, in order to pursue his lawless  depredations. I had forgotten all this, and never dreaming that Tom  would appropriate such light food, I left the candle lying in the  middle of the table, just under the window.    Between sleeping and waking, I heard the pane gently pushed in.  The thought instantly struck me that it was Tom, and that, for  lack of something better, he might steal my precious candle.    I sprang up from the bed, just in time to see him dart through the  broken window, dragging the long white candle after him. I flew to  the door, and pursued him half over the field, but all to no  purpose. I can see him now, as I saw him then, scampering away for  dear life, with his prize trailing behind him, gleaming like a  silver tail in the bright light of the moon.    Ah! never did I feel more acutely the truth of the proverb, \"Those  that go a-borrowing go a-sorrowing,\" than I did that night. My poor  boy awoke ill and feverish, and I had no light to assist him, or  even to look into his sweet face, to see how far I dared hope that  the light of day would find him better.      OH CANADA! THY GLOOMY WOODS    A song      Oh Canada! thy gloomy woods      Will never cheer the heart;    The murmur of thy mighty floods      But cause fresh tears to start    From those whose fondest wishes rest      Beyond the distant main;    Who, 'mid the forests of the West,      Sigh for their homes again.      I, too, have felt the chilling blight      Their shadows cast on me,    My thought by day--my dream by night--      Was of my own country.    But independent souls will brave      All hardships to be free;    No more I weep to cross the wave,      My native land to see.      But ever as a thought most bless'd,      Her distant shores will rise,    In all their spring-tide beauty dress'd.      To cheer my mental eyes.    And treasured in my inmost heart,      The friends I left behind;    But reason's voice, that bade us part,      Now bids me be resign'd.      I see my children round me play,      My husband's smiles approve;    I dash regretful tears away,      And lift my thoughts above:    In humble gratitude to bless      The Almighty hand that spread    Our table in the wilderness,      And gave my infants bread.            CHAPTER VI    OLD SATAN AND TOM WILSON'S NOSE          \"A nose, kind sir! Sure mother Nature,    With all her freaks, ne'er formed this feature.    If such were mine, I'd try and trade it,    And swear the gods had never made it.\"      After reducing the log cabin into some sort of order, we contrived,  with the aid of a few boards, to make a bed-closet for poor Tom  Wilson, who continued to shake every day with the pitiless ague.  There was no way of admitting light and air into this domicile,  which opened into the general apartment, but through a square hole  cut in one of the planks, just wide enough to admit a man's head  through the aperture. Here we made Tom a comfortable bed on the  floor, and did the best we could to nurse him through his sickness.  His long, thin face, emaciated with disease, and surrounded by huge  black whiskers, and a beard of a week's growth, looked perfectly  unearthly. He had only to stare at the baby to frighten her almost  out of her wits.    \"How fond that young one is of me,\" he would say; \"she cries for joy  at the sight of me.\"    Among his curiosities, and he had many, he held in great esteem a  huge nose, made hollow to fit his face, which his father, a being  almost as eccentric as himself, had carved out of boxwood. When he  slipped this nose over his own (which was no beautiful classical  specimen of a nasal organ), it made a most perfect and hideous  disguise. The mother who bore him never would have recognised her  accomplished son.    Numberless were the tricks he played off with this nose. Once he  walked through the streets of ----, with this proboscis attached to  his face. \"What a nose! Look at the man with the nose!\" cried all  the boys in the street. A party of Irish emigrants passed at the  moment. The men, with the courtesy natural to their nation, forbore  to laugh in the gentleman's face; but after they had passed, Tom  looked back, and saw them bent half double in convulsions of mirth.  Tom made the party a low bow, gravely took off his nose, and put it  in his pocket.    The day after this frolic, he had a very severe fit of the ague, and  looked so ill that I really entertained fears for his life. The hot  fit had just left him, and he lay upon his bed bedewed with a cold  perspiration, in a state of complete exhaustion.    \"Poor Tom,\" said I, \"he has passed a horrible day, but the worst  is over, and I will make him a cup of coffee.\" While preparing it,  Old Satan came in and began to talk to my husband. He happened to  sit directly opposite the aperture which gave light and air to  Tom's berth. This man was disgustingly ugly. He had lost one eye  in a quarrel. It had been gouged out in the barbarous conflict,  and the side of his face presented a succession of horrible scars  inflicted by the teeth of his savage adversary. The nickname he had  acquired through the country sufficiently testified to the  respectability of his character, and dreadful tales were told of  him in the neighbourhood, where he was alike feared and hated.    The rude fellow, with his accustomed insolence, began abusing the  old country folks.    The English were great bullies, he said; they thought no one could  fight but themselves; but the Yankees had whipped them, and would  whip them again. He was not afear'd of them, he never was afear'd  in his life.    Scarcely were "]]]
