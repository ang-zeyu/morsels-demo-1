Sam, as  usual, broke the silence by saying,--    \"It is a perfect shame! She might as well be a nigger slave! I suppose  they think they have bought her and sold her. I should like to see 'em  all, just for once, and tell 'em that her flesh and blood is as good as  theirs; and that, with all their airs and their money, they've no  business to\"--    \"Sam,\" said poor Grace, \"you shall not say such things. Huldah has  stayed because she chose to stay; and that is the worst of it. She will  not think of herself, not for one minute; and so--everything happens.\"    And Grace was sobbing beyond speech again; and her intervention  amounted, therefore, to little or nothing. The boys, through the  evening, descanted among themselves on the outrage. Grandmamma, and at  last their mother, took successive turns in taming their indignation;  but, for all this, it was a miserable evening. As for John Root, he took  a lamp in one hand, and \"The Weekly Tribune\" in the other, and sat  before the fire, and pretended to read; but not once did John Root  change the fold of the paper that evening. It was a wretched Christmas  eve; and, at half-past eight, every light was out, and every member of  the household was lying stark awake, in bed.           *       *       *       *       *    Huldah Root, you see, was a servant with the Bartletts, in Boston. When  she was only sixteen, she was engaged at her \"trade,\" as a vest-maker,  in that town; and, by some chance, made an appointment to sew as a  seamstress at Mrs. Bartlett's for a fortnight. There were any number of  children to be clothed there; and the fortnight extended to a month.  Then the month became two months. She grew fond of Mrs. Bartlett,  because Mrs. Bartlett grew fond of her. The children adored her; and she  kept an eye to them; and it ended in her engaging to spend the winter  there, half-seamstress, half-nurse, half-nursery-governess, and a little  of everything. From such a beginning, it had happened that she had lived  there six years, in confidential service. She could cook better than  anybody in the house,--better than Mrs. Bartlett herself; but it was not  often that she tried her talent there. On a birthday perhaps, in August,  she would make huckleberry cakes, by the old homestead \"receipt,\" for  the children. She had the run of all their clothes as nobody else did;  took the younger ones to be measured; and saw that none of the older  ones went out with a crack in a seam, or a rough edge at the foot of a  trowser. It was whispered that Minnie had rather go into the sewing-room  to get Huldah to \"show her\" about \"alligation\" or \"square-root,\" than  to wait for Miss Thurber's explanations in the morning. In fifty such  ways, it happened that Huldah--who, on the roll-call of the census-man,  probably rated as a nursery-maid in the house--was the confidential  friend of every member of the family, from Mr. Bartlett, who wanted to  know where \"The Intelligencer\" was, down to the chore-boy who came in to  black the shoes. And so it was, that, when poor little Horace was  brought in with his skull knocked in by the pony, Huldah was--and  modestly knew that she was--the most essential person in the stunned  family circle.    While her brothers and sisters were putting out their lights at New  Durham, heart-sick and wounded, Huldah was sitting in that still room,  where only the rough broken breathing of poor Horace broke the sound.  She was changing, once in ten minutes, the ice-water cloths; was feeling  of his feet sometimes; wetting his tongue once or twice in an hour;  putting her finger to his pulse with a native sense, which needed no  second-hand to help it; and all the time, with the thought of him, was  remembering how grieved and hurt and heart-broken they were at home.  Every half-hour or less, a pale face appeared at the door; and Huldah  just slid across the room, and said, \"He is really doing nicely, pray  lie down;\" or, \"His pulse is surely better, I will certainly come to you  if it flags;\" or \"Pray trust me, I will not let you wait a moment if he  needs you;\" or, \"Pray get ready for to-morrow. An hour's sleep now will  be worth everything to you then.\" And the poor mother would crawl back  to her baby and her bed, and pretend to try to sleep; and in half an  hour would appear again at the door. One o'clock, two o'clock, three  o'clock. How companionable Dr. Lowell's clock seems when one is sitting  up so, with no one else to talk to! Four o'clock at last; it is really  growing to be quite intimate. Five o'clock. \"If I were in dear Durham  now, one of the roosters would be calling,\"--Six o'clock. Poor Horace  stirs, turns, flings his arm over. \"Mother--O Huldah! is it you? How  nice that is!\" And he is unconscious again; but he had had sense enough  to know her. What a blessed Christmas present that is, to tell that to  his poor mother when she slides in at daybreak, and says, \"You shall go  to bed now, dear child. You see I am very fresh; and you must rest  yourself, you know. Do you really say he knew you? Are you sure he knew  you? Why, Huldah, what an angel of peace you are!\"    So opened Huldah's Christmas morning.           *       *       *       *       *    Days of doubt, nights of watching. Every now and then the boy knows his  mother, his father, or Huldah. Then will come this heavy stupor which is  so different from sleep. At last the surgeons have determined that a  piece of the bone must come away. There is the quiet gathering of the  most skilful at the determined hour; there is the firm table for the  little fellow to lie on; here is the ether and the sponge; and, of  course, here and there, and everywhere, is Huldah. She can hold the  sponge, or she can fetch and carry; she can answer at once if she is  spoken to; she can wait, if it is waiting; she can act, if it is acting.  At last the wretched little button, which has been pressing on our poor  boy's brain, is lifted safely out. It is in Morton's hand; he smiles and  nods at Huldah as she looks inquiry, and she knows he is satisfied. And  does not the poor child himself, even in his unconscious sleep, draw  his breath more lightly than he did before? All is well.    \"Who do you say that young woman is?\" says Dr. Morton to Mr. Bartlett,  as he draws on his coat in the doorway after all is over. \"Could we not  tempt her over to the General Hospital?\"    \"No, I think not. I do not think we can spare her.\"    The boy Horace is new-born that day; a New Year's gift to his mother. So  pass Huldah's holidays.      II.    CHRISTMAS AGAIN.    Fourteen years make of the boy whose pony has been too much for him a  man equal to any prank of any pony. Fourteen years will do this, even to  boys of ten. Horace Bartlett is the colonel of a cavalry regiment,  stationed just now in West Virginia; and, as it happens, this  twenty-four-year-old boy has an older commission than anybody in that  region, and is the Post Commander at Talbot C. H., and will be, most  likely, for the winter. The boy has a vein of foresight in him; a good  deal of system; and, what is worth while to have by the side of system,  some knack of order. So soon as he finds that he is responsible, he  begins to prepare for responsibility. His staff-officers are boys too;  but they are all friends, and all mean to do their best. His  Surgeon-in-Charge took his degree at Washington last spring; that is  encouraging. Perhaps, if he has not much experience, he has, at least,  the latest advices. His head is level too; he means to do his best, such  as it is; and, indeed, all hands in that knot of boy counsellors will  not fail for laziness or carelessness. Their very youth makes them  provident and grave.    So among a hundred other letters, as October opens, Horace writes  this:--            TALBOT COURT HOUSE, VA.,              Oct. 3, 1863.        DEAR HULDAH,--Here we are still, as I have been explaining to      father; and, as you will see by my letter to him, here we are      like to stay. Thus far we are doing sufficiently well. As I have      told him, if my plans had been adopted we should have been      pushed rapidly forward up the valley of the Yellow Creek;      Badger's corps would have been withdrawn from before Winchester;      Wilcox and Steele together would have threatened Early; and      then, by a rapid flank movement, we should have pounced down on      Longstreet (not the great Longstreet, but little Longstreet),      and compelled him to uncover Lynchburg; we could have blown up      the dams and locks on the canal, made a freshet to sweep all the      obstructions out of James River, and then, if they had shown      half as much spirit on the Potomac, all of us would be in      Richmond for our Christmas dinner. But my plans, as usual, were      not asked for, far less taken. So, as I said, here we are.        Well, I have been talking with Lawrence Worster, my      Surgeon-in-Charge, who is a very good fellow. His sick-list is      not bad now, and he does not mean to have it bad; but he says      that he is not pleased with the ways of his ward-masters; and it      was his suggestion, not mine, mark you, that I should see if one      or two of the Sanitary women would not come as far as this to      make things decent. So, of course, I write to you. Don't you      think mother could spare you to spend the winter here? It will      be rough, of course; but it is all in the good cause. Perhaps      you know some nice women,--well, not like you, of course; but      still, disinterested and sensible, who would come too. Think of      this carefully, I beg you, and talk to father and mother.      Worster says we may have three hundred boys in hospital before      Christmas. If Jubal Early should come this way, I don't know how      many more. Talk with mother and father.            Always"]]]
