But the face of the statue is a more explicit contradiction  still; it is resolute, thoughtful, serene, and full of beauty; and we  must, therefore, for once, allow the somewhat boastful introduction of  the Virtues to have been perfectly just: though the whole tomb is most  notable, as furnishing not only the exact intermediate condition in  style between the pure Gothic and its final Renaissance corruption, but,  at the same time, the exactly intermediate condition of _feeling_  between the pure calmness of early Christianity, and the boastful pomp  of the Renaissance faithlessness; for here we have still the religious  humility remaining in the mosaic of the canopy, which shows the Doge  kneeling before the cross, while yet this tendency to self-trust is  shown in the surrounding of the coffin by the Virtues.    Sec. LXIX. The next tomb by the side of which they appear is that of  Jacopo Cavalli, in the same chapel of St. John and Paul which contains the  tomb of the Doge Delfin. It is peculiarly rich in religious imagery,  adorned by boldly cut types of the four evangelists, and of two saints,  while, on projecting brackets in front of it, stood three statues of  Faith, Hope, and Charity, now lost, but drawn in Zanotto's work. It is all  rich in detail, and its sculptor has been proud of it, thus recording his  name below the epitaph:      \"QST OPERA DINTALGIO E FATTO IN PIERA,     UNVENICIAN LAFE CHANOME POLO,     NATO DI JACHOMEL CHATAIAPIERA.\"       This work of sculpture is done in stone;     A Venetian did it, named Paul,     Son of Jachomel the stone-cutter.    Jacopo Cavalli died in 1384. He was a bold and active Veronese soldier,  did the state much service, was therefore ennobled by it, and became the  founder of the house of the Cavalli; but I find no especial reason for  the images of the Virtues, especially that of Charity, appearing at his  tomb, unless it be this: that at the siege of Feltre, in the war against  Leopold of Austria, he refused to assault the city, because the senate  would not grant his soldiers the pillage of the town. The feet of the  recumbent figure, which is in full armor, rest on a dog, and its head on  two lions; and these animals (neither of which form any part of the  knight's bearings) are said by Zanotto to be intended to symbolize his  bravery and fidelity. If, however, the lions are meant to set forth  courage, it is a pity they should have been represented as howling.    Sec. LXX. We must next pause for an instant beside the tomb of Michael  Steno, now in the northern aisle of St. John and Paul, having been  removed there from the destroyed church of the Servi: first, to note its  remarkable return to the early simplicity, the sarcophagus being  decorated only with two crosses in quatrefoils, though it is of the  fifteenth century, Steno dying in 1413; and, in the second place, to  observe the peculiarity of the epitaph, which eulogises Steno as having  been \"amator justitie, pacis, et ubertatis,\" \"a lover of justice, peace,  and plenty.\" In the epitaphs of this period, the virtues which are made  most account of in public men are those which were most useful to their  country. We have already seen one example in the epitaph on Simon  Dandolo; and similar expressions occur constantly in laudatory mentions  of their later Doges by the Venetian writers. Thus Sansovino of Marco  Cornaro, \"Era savio huomo, eloquente, e amava molto la pace e l'  abbondanza della citta;\" and of Tomaso Mocenigo, \"Huomo oltre modo  desideroso della pace.\"    Of the tomb of this last-named Doge mention has before been made. Here,  as in Morosini's, the images of the Virtues have no ironical power,  although their great conspicuousness marks the increase of the boastful  feeling in the treatment of monuments. For the rest, this tomb is the  last in Venice which can be considered as belonging to the Gothic  period. Its mouldings are already rudely classical, and it has  meaningless figures in Roman armor at the angles; but its tabernacle  above is still Gothic, and the recumbent figure is very beautiful. It  was carved by two Florentine sculptors in 1423.    Sec. LXXI. Tomaso Mocenigo was succeeded by the renowned Doge, Francesco  Foscari, under whom, it will be remembered, the last additions were made  to the Gothic Ducal Palace; additions which, in form only, not in  spirit, corresponded to the older portions; since, during his reign, the  transition took place which permits us no longer to consider the  Venetian architecture as Gothic at all. He died in 1457, and his tomb is  the first important example of Renaissance art.    Not, however, a good characteristic example. It is remarkable chiefly as  introducing all the faults of the Renaissance at an early period, when  its merits, such as they are, were yet undeveloped. Its claim to be  rated as a classical composition is altogether destroyed by the remnants  of Gothic feeling which cling to it here and there in their last forms  of degradation; and of which, now that we find them thus corrupted, the  sooner we are rid the better. Thus the sarcophagus is supported by a  species of trefoil arches; the bases of the shafts have still their  spurs; and the whole tomb is covered by a pediment, with crockets and a  pinnacle. We shall find that the perfect Renaissance is at least pure in  its insipidity, and subtle in its vice; but this monument is remarkable  as showing the refuse of one style encumbering the embryo of another,  and all principles of life entangled either in the swaddling clothes or  the shroud.    Sec. LXXII. With respect to our present purpose, however, it is a monument  of enormous importance. We have to trace, be it remembered, the pride of  state in its gradual intrusion upon the sepulchre; and the consequent  and correlative vanishing of the expressions of religious feeling and  heavenly hope, together with the more and more arrogant setting forth of  the virtues of the dead. Now this tomb is the largest and most costly we  have yet seen; but its means of religious expression are limited to a  single statue of Christ, small and used merely as a pinnacle at the top.  The rest of the composition is as curious as it is vulgar. The conceit,  so often noticed as having been borrowed from the Pisan school, of  angels withdrawing the curtains of the couch to look down upon the dead,  was brought forward with increasing prominence by every succeeding  sculptor; but, as we draw nearer to the Renaissance period, we find that  the _angels_ become of less importance, and the _curtains_ of more. With  the Pisans, the curtains are introduced as a motive for the angels; with  the Renaissance sculptors, the angels are introduced merely as a motive  for the curtains, which become every day more huge and elaborate. In the  monument of Mocenigo, they have already expanded into a tent, with a  pole in the centre of it: and in that of Foscari, for the first time,  the _angels are absent altogether_; while the curtains are arranged in  the form of an enormous French tent-bed, and are sustained at the flanks  by two diminutive figures in Roman armor; substituted for the angels,  merely that the sculptor might _show his knowledge_ of classical  costume. And now observe how often a fault in feeling induces also a  fault in style. In the old tombs, the angels used to stand on or by the  side of the sarcophagus; but their places are here to be occupied by the  Virtues, and therefore, to sustain the diminutive Roman figures at the  necessary height, each has a whole Corinthian pillar to himself, a  pillar whose shaft is eleven feet high, and some three or four feet  round: and because this was not high enough, it is put on a pedestal  four feet and a half high; and has a spurred base besides of its own, a  tall capital, then a huge bracket above the capital, and then another  pedestal above the bracket, and on the top of all the diminutive figure  who has charge of the curtains.    Sec. LXXIII. Under the canopy, thus arranged, is placed the sarcophagus  with its recumbent figure. The statues of the Virgin and the saints have  disappeared from it. In their stead, its panels are filled with  half-length figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity; while Temperance and  Fortitude are at the Doge's feet, Justice and Prudence at his head,  figures now the size of life, yet nevertheless recognizable only by  their attributes: for, except that Hope raises her eyes, there is no  difference in the character or expression of any of their faces,--they  are nothing more than handsome Venetian women, in rather full and  courtly dresses, and tolerably well thrown into postures for effect from  below. Fortitude could not of course be placed in a graceful one without  some sacrifice of her character, but that was of no consequence in the  eyes of the sculptors of this period, so she leans back languidly, and  nearly overthrows her own column; while Temperance, and Justice opposite  to her, as neither the left hand of the one nor the right hand of the  other could be seen from below, have been _left with one hand each_.    Sec. LXXIV. Still these figures, coarse and feelingless as they are, have  been worked with care, because the principal effect of the tomb depends  on them. But the effigy of the Doge, of which nothing but the side is  visible, has been utterly neglected; and the ingenuity of the sculptor  is not so great, at the best, as that he can afford to be slovenly.  There is, indeed, nothing in the history of Foscari which would lead us  to expect anything particularly noble in his face; but I trust,  nevertheless, it has been misrepresented by this despicable carver; for  no words are strong enough to express the baseness of the portraiture.

This  experiment is a new proof that water is a compound substance.    FOOTNOTES:    [16] In the latter part of this work will be found a particular account  of the processes necessary for separating the different kinds of gasses,  and for determining their quantities.--A.    [17] This expression Hydrogen has been very severely criticised by some,  who pretend that it signifies engendered by water, and not that which  engenders water. The experiments related in this chapter prove, that,  when water is decomposed, hydrogen is produced, and that, when hydrogen  is combined with oxygen, water is produced: So that we may say, with  equal truth, that water is produced from hydrogen, or hydrogen is  produced from water.--A.    [18] See the nature of these salts in the second part of this book.--A.    [19] By potash is here meant, pure or caustic alkali, deprived of  carbonic acid by means of quick-lime: In general, we may observe here,  that all the alkalies and earths must invariably be considered as in  their pure or caustic state, unless otherwise expressed.--E. The method  of obtaining this pure alkali of potash will be given in the sequel.--A.    [20] See the third part of this work.--A.    [21] See an account of this apparatus in the third part of this  work.--A.          CHAP. IX.    _Of the quantities of Caloric disengaged from different species of  Combustion._      We have already mentioned, that, when any body is burnt in the center of  a hollow sphere of ice and supplied with air at the temperature of zero  (32 deg.), the quantity of ice melted from the inside of the sphere  becomes a measure of the relative quantities of caloric disengaged. Mr  de la Place and I gave a description of the apparatus employed for this  kind of experiment in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1780, p. 355; and a  description and plate of the same apparatus will be found in the third  part of this work. With this apparatus, phosphorus, charcoal, and  hydrogen gas, gave the following results:    One pound of phosphorus melted 100 libs. of ice.    One pound of charcoal melted 96 libs. 8 oz.    One pound of hydrogen gas melted 295 libs. 9 oz. 3-1/2 gros.    As a concrete acid is formed by the combustion of phosphorus, it is  probable that very little caloric remains in the acid, and,  consequently, that the above experiment gives us very nearly the whole  quantity of caloric contained in the oxygen gas. Even if we suppose the  phosphoric acid to contain a good deal of caloric, yet, as the  phosphorus must have contained nearly an equal quantity before  combustion, the error must be very small, as it will only consist of the  difference between what was contained in the phosphorus before, and in  the phosphoric acid after combustion.    I have already shown in Chap. V. that one pound of phosphorus absorbs  one pound eight ounces of oxygen during combustion; and since, by the  same operation, 100 lib. of ice are melted, it follows, that the  quantity of caloric contained in one pound of oxygen gas is capable of  melting 66 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of ice.    One pound of charcoal during combustion melts only 96 libs. 8 oz. of  ice, whilst it absorbs 2 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros 10 grs. of oxygen.  By the experiment with phosphorus, this quantity of oxygen gas ought to  disengage a quantity of caloric sufficient to melt 171 libs. 6 oz. 5  gros of ice; consequently, during this experiment, a quantity of  caloric, sufficient to melt 74 libs. 14 oz. 5 gros of ice  disappears. Carbonic acid is not, like phosphoric acid, in a concrete  state after combustion but in the state of gas, and requires to be  united with caloric to enable it to subsist in that state; the quantity  of caloric missing in the last experiment is evidently employed for that  purpose. When we divide that quantity by the weight of carbonic acid,  formed by the combustion of one pound of charcoal, we find that the  quantity of caloric necessary for changing one pound of carbonic acid  from the concrete to the gasseous state, would be capable of melting 20  libs. 15 oz. 5 gros of ice.    We may make a similar calculation with the combustion of hydrogen gas  and the consequent formation of water. During the combustion of one  pound of hydrogen gas, 5 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of oxygen  gas are absorbed, and 295 libs. 9 oz. 3-1/2 gros of ice are  melted. But 5 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of oxygen gas, in  changing from the aeriform to the solid state, loses, according to the  experiment with phosphorus, enough of caloric to have melted 377 libs.  12 oz. 3 gros of ice. There is only disengaged, from the same  quantity of oxygen, during its combustion with hydrogen gas, as much  caloric as melts 295 libs. 2 oz. 3-1/2 gros; wherefore there  remains in the water at Zero (32 deg.), formed, during this experiment,  as much caloric as would melt 82 libs. 9 oz. 7-1/2 gros of ice.    Hence, as 6 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of water are formed from  the combustion of one pound of hydrogen gas with 5 libs. 10 oz. 5  gros 24 grs. of oxygen, it follows that, in each pound of water, at  the temperature of Zero, (32 deg.), there exists as much caloric as  would melt 12 libs. 5 oz. 2 gros 48 grs. of ice, without taking into  account the quantity originally contained in the hydrogen gas, which we  have been obliged to omit, for want of data to calculate its quantity.  From this it appears that water, even in the state of ice, contains a  considerable quantity of caloric, and that oxygen, in entering into that  combination, retains likewise a good proportion.    From these experiments, we may assume the following results as  sufficiently established.      _Combustion of Phosphorus._    From the combustion of phosphorus, as related in the foregoing  experiments, it appears, that one pound of phosphorus requires 1 lib.  8 oz. of oxygen gas for its combustion, and that 2 libs. 8 oz. of  concrete phosphoric acid are produced.    The quantity of caloric disengaged by the  combustion of one pound of phosphorus, expressed  by the number of pounds of ice melted  during that operation, is                           100.00000.    The quantity disengaged from each pound of  oxygen, during the combustion of phosphorus,  expressed in the same manner, is                     66.66667.    The quantity disengaged during the formation  of one pound of phosphoric acid,                     40.00000.    The quantity remaining in each pound of phosphoric  acid,                                                 0.00000(A).    [Note A: We here suppose the phosphoric acid not to contain any caloric,  which is not strictly true; but, as I have before observed, the quantity  it really contains is probably very small, and we have not given it a  value, for want of a sufficient data to go upon.--A.]        _Combustion of Charcoal._    In the combustion of one pound of charcoal, 2 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros  10 grs. of oxygen gas are absorbed, and 3 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros 10  grs. of carbonic acid gas are formed.    Caloric, disengaged daring the combustion  of one pound of charcoal,                        96.50000(A).    Caloric disengaged during the combustion of  charcoal, from each pound of oxygen gas  absorbed,                                        37.52823.    Caloric disengaged during the formation of  one pound of carbonic acid gas,                  27.02024.    Caloric retained by each pound of oxygen  after the combustion,                            29.13844.    Caloric necessary for supporting one pound  of carbonic acid in the state of gas,            20.97960.    [Note A: All these relative quantities of caloric are expressed by the  number of pounds of ice, and decimal parts, melted during the several  operations.--E.]      _Combustion of Hydrogen Gas._    In the combustion of one pound of hydrogen gas, 5 libs. 10 oz. 5  gros 24 grs. of oxygen gas are absorbed, and 6 libs. 10 oz. 5  gros 24 grs. of water are formed.    Caloric from each lib. of hydrogen gas,                       295.58950.  Caloric from each lib. of oxygen gas,                          52.16280.  Caloric disengaged during the formation of each pound of water,  44.33840.  Caloric retained by each lib. of oxygen after    combustion with hydrogen,                                      14.50386.  Caloric retained by each lib. of water at    the temperature of Zero (32 deg.),                             12.32823.      _Of the Formation of Nitric Acid._    When we combine nitrous gas with oxygen gas, so as to form nitric or  nitrous acid a degree of heat is produced, which is much less  considerable than what is evolved during the other combinations of  oxygen; whence it follows that oxygen, when it becomes fixed in nitric  acid, retains a great part of the heat which it possessed in the state  of gas. It is certainly possible to determine the quantity of caloric  which is disengaged during the combination of these two gasses, and  consequently to determine what quantity remains after the combination  takes place. The first of these quantities might be ascertained, by  making the combination of the two gasses in an apparatus surrounded by  ice; but, as the quantity of caloric disengaged is very inconsiderable,  it would be necessary to operate upon a large quantity of the two gasses  in a very troublesome and complicated apparatus. By this consideration,  Mr de la Place and I have hitherto been prevented from making the  attempt. In the mean time, the place of such an experiment may be  supplied by calculations, the results of which cannot be very far from  truth.    Mr de la Place and I deflagrated a convenient quantity of nitre and  charcoal in an ice apparatus, and found that twelve pounds of ice were  melted by the deflagration of one pound of nitre. We shall see, in the  sequel, that one pound of nitre is composed, as under, of    Potash   7 oz. 6 gros 51.84 grs. = 4515.84 grs.  Dry acid 8       1        21.16        ="]]]
