From _B. t. analogous_, _B. t. canutus_ differs in: dorsum paler, less  of dark brown hues; belly paler; forefeet and hind feet slightly paler,  less sooty above; tail less hairy, paler and having scales evident;  jugal of zygoma extending ventrally to a point immediately above,  instead of below, level of alveolus of upper molars; nasals more nearly  truncate anteriorly; infraorbital foramina less deeply notched toward  midline of skull; body and skull averaging smaller throughout.    From _B. t. allex_, _B. t. canutus_ differs in: dorsal ground color  grayish rather than fawn color having grayish overtones; underfur on  dorsum darker gray; dorsal surface of forefeet and hind feet  flesh-colored to grayish rather than flesh-colored; incisive foramina  tapering to a point posteriorly rather than rounded posteriorly;  interparietal relatively smaller; body and skull averaging larger  throughout.    _Remarks._--Burt (1938:54) reluctantly assigned specimens from Ciudad  Obregon to _B. t. paulus_, probably being influenced by the resemblance  in size. He suggested that, perhaps, a distinct subspecies occurs in the  State of Sonora. Study of larger series of specimens than were available  to Burt reveals that populations of pygmy mice inhabiting the northwest  coastal plains of Mexico are indeed distinct.    The darkest of the material assigned to _canutus_ is from Nayarit (for  specific localities see specimens examined). According to Tamayo  (1949:Carta de Suelos), color of soil changes from chestnut in northern  Sinaloa to black in southern Sinaloa and northern Nayarit. There seems,  therefore, to be a close correlation between color of pelage and color  of soil in this area. In Nayarit, particularly in the central and  southern parts, the mice are intermediate in color between the paler,  grayer population to the north and the more brownish samples,  representative of _allex_ to the south. The coastal vegetation changes  from the arid tropical thorn forests of the north and central parts of  Sinaloa to a savannah in Nayarit, thence to a tropical deciduous forest  farther south (see Leopold, 1950:508).    In size and color, specimens from 3 mi. SE Tepic and 2 mi. SW Rosa  Morada are intermediate between the larger, grayer _canutus_ and the  smaller, light-brownish _allex_. In size of cranium, these specimens are  more nearly like _canutus_, and are referred to that subspecies. Mice  from the western coastal plain are relatively homogeneous as regards  size of body and skull, except that those from 13.5 mi. S Acaponeta,  Nayarit, average somewhat larger.    _B. t. canutus_, like _B. t. subater_, is predominantly a lowland or  coastal subspecies. The pallor of the former, that lives on generally  paler soils, presumably is of adaptive value.    Pygmy mice are seemingly rare in the northern part of the range of this  subspecies. J. Raymond Alcorn and Albert Alcorn were successful in  collecting only two specimens from the type locality after three  successive nights of trapping with 100 traps set each night. Only six  specimens are known from Sonora. These were obtained in the irrigated  regions of Ciudad, Obregon, and Navajoa. Charles Sibley obtained one  specimen 10.6 mi. SE Ciudad Obregon in a \"maguey field.\" I obtained one  specimen 1 mi. NNW Navajoa in a sparse grassway, 20 feet wide, bordering  an open sewer, which coursed northward into the Rio Mayo. Irrigated  wheat fields bordered the grassway and ditch.    _Specimens examined._--Total 70 all from the Republic of Mexico and  distributed as follows: SONORA: [Ciudad] Obregon, 4[44]; 10.6 mi.

Ser.) 1:155, December 28, 1953 (part).        _Baiomys taylori taylori_, Booth, Walla Walla Publs. Dept. Biol.         Sci., 20:15, July 10, 1957 (part).    _Type._--Adult male, skin and skull; No. 36765, University of Kansas,  Museum of Natural History; 10 mi. E, 2 mi. N Ciudad del Maiz, 4000 ft.,  San Luis Potosi, Republic of Mexico; obtained on January 17, 1950, by J.  R. Alcorn, original number 10400.    _Range._--Occurs in the Sierra Madre Oriental of the northeastern third  of San Luis Potosi. Zonal range: Upper Tropical (see Dalquest, 1953:10);  approximates a part of the Sierra Madre Oriental Biotic Province of  Goldman and Moore (1945:349, 356). Occurs from 2000 feet at El Salto up  to 4000 feet at Ciudad del Maiz.    _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; ground color of dorsum  Chaetura Drab; individual guard hairs of dorsum black to base, distal  fourth of hairs of underfur in posterior half of dorsum tipped with  grayish-brown, proximal three-fourths Dark Neutral Gray; in anterior  region of dorsum, posterior to ears, distal third of hairs grayish-brown  and proximal two-thirds Dark Neutral Gray to base; sides slightly paler  than dorsum; ground color of belly Neutral Gray, individual hairs of  belly and throat tipped with Pallid Neutral Gray, basally Deep Neutral  Gray to Dark Neutral Gray; tips of individual hairs of face  Ochraceous-Tawny; lateral vibrissae whitish, dorsal and ventral  vibrissae black to base; forefeet and hind feet sooty above and below,  thigh bearing some white-tipped hairs; tail near Chaetura Drab above,  Pale Neutral Gray below; anterior part of jugal projecting slightly  ventrally and forming small protuberance at point of articulation with  maxillary part of zygoma; jugal extending anteriorly nearly to lacrimal.  In most cranial measurements averaging as large as _B. t. analogous_.  Average and extreme measurements of the type and three additional  paratypes, all adults, are: total length, 105.5 (101-109); length of  tail, 39.8 (35-42); length of body, 65.8 (63-68); length of hind foot,  14.3 (14-15); length of ear from notch, 11 (11); occipitonasal length,  18.1 (18.1-18.8); zygomatic breadth, 9.6 (9.3-9.8); postpalatal length,  6.5 (6.0-6.7); least interorbital breadth, 3.4 (3.3-3.6); length of  incisive foramina, 4.0 (3.8-4.2); length of rostrum, 6.3 (6.1-6.4);  breadth of braincase, 8.8 (8.6-8.9); depth of cranium, 6.7 (6.5-6.8);  alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 3.2 (3.1-3.3); for photograph of  skull, see Plate 2_d_, and Plate 4_e_.    _Comparisons._--From _B. t. taylori_, _B. t. fuliginatus_ differs in:  dorsum slightly darker than in darkest _taylori_; tail densely haired,  bicolored rather than unicolored; belly sooty to grayish rather than  grayish to whitish; forefeet and hind feet sooty to grayish rather than  flesh-colored; incisive foramina less bowed laterally, more nearly  straight; interparietal compressed anteroposteriorly, less  diamond-shaped.    From _B. t. paulus_, _B. t. fuliginatus_ differs in: dorsum dusky to  blackish rather than fawn color; belly sooty to grayish rather than  buffy to whitish-gray; forefeet and hind feet sooty to grayish rather  than whitish; zygoma more nearly forming a right angle with rostrum or  skull, less tapered anteriorly; anterior part of jugal possessing  ventral projection; jugal extending nearly to lacrimal on posterior  surface of maxillary part of zygoma.    From _B. t. analogous_, _B. t. fuliginatus_ differs in: mid-dorsal  region blacker, less brownish; tail distinctly bicolored rather than  unicolored to faintly bicolored; incisive foramina not constricted  medially; presphenoid broader (at narrowest point); jugal differs much  the same as it does from _paulus_; nasals anteriorly truncate instead of  rounded.    _Remarks._--Dalquest (1953:155-157) and Booth (1957:15) assigned all of  the pygmy mice that they examined from the state of San Luis Potosi to  _B. t. taylori_. Examination of all of the material that was available  to Dalquest, plus additional specimens at the University of Kansas  Museum of Natural History, reveals that there are three subspecies in  San Luis Potosi. _B. t. taylori_ occurs in the eastern part of the State  at lower altitudes; _B. t. analogous_ occurs to the southeast at higher  altitudes; _B. t. fuliginatus_ occurs in the northeastern part of the  State in the Sierra Madre Oriental.    Specimens obtained from Ebano, Pujal, and Tamuin, representative of _B.  t. taylori_, are much paler on the belly and on the ventral surface of  the forefeet and hind feet than are specimens from Ciudad del Maiz,  representative of _B. t. fuliginatus_. The tail in _B. t. taylori_ is  nearly unicolored and less hairy than in the paratypical series of  _fuliginatus_. Specimens from 4 km. NE Ciudad Valles are nearly  intermediate in color of the belly, dorsum, forefeet and hind feet, and  tail, between the palest mice from the coastal plain and the darker mice  in the mountains of the northeastern part of the State (specimens from  El Salto average paler, however, than the type and paratypes). These  specimens seem to be intergrades between _B. t. taylori_ to the east "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38308"],[0,"Natural History of Cottonmouth Moccasin, Agkistrodon piscovorus (Reptilia) (#19)"],[1," 1.
