Another disagreeable circumstance of long fasting is,  the extreme difficulty and pain attending the natural evacuations for  the first time; and which is so dreadful, that of it none but those who  have experienced can have an adequate idea.    To record in detail each day's fare since the commencement of this  journey, would be little more than a dull repetition of the same  occurrences. A sufficient idea of it may be given in a few words, by  observing that it may justly be said to have been either all feasting,  or all famine; sometimes we had too much, seldom just enough, frequently  too little, and often none at all. It will be only necessary to say that  we have fasted many times two whole days and nights; twice upwards of  three days; and once, while at She-than-nee, near seven days, during  which we tasted not a mouthful of anything, except a few cranberries,  water, scraps of old leather, and burnt bones. On those pressing  occasions I have frequently seen the Indians examine their wardrobe,  {34} which consisted chiefly of skin-clothing, and consider what part  could best be spared; sometimes a piece of an old, half-rotten deer  skin, and at others a pair of old shoes, were sacrificed to alleviate  extreme hunger. The relation of such uncommon hardships may perhaps gain  little credit in Europe; while those who are conversant with the history  of Hudson's Bay, and who are thoroughly acquainted with the distress  which the natives of the country about it frequently endure, may  consider them as no more than the common occurrences of an Indian life,  in which they are frequently driven to the necessity of eating one  another.[T]    [Sidenote: 1770. June.]    [Sidenote: 26th.]    [Sidenote: 30th.]    [Sidenote: 1770. July.]    {35} Knowing that our constant loads would not permit us to carry much  provisions with us, we agreed to continue a day or two to refresh  ourselves, and to dry a little meat in the sun, as it thereby not only  becomes more portable, but is always ready for use. On the twenty-sixth,  all that remained of the musk-ox flesh being properly dried and fit for  carriage, we began to proceed on our journey Northward, and on the  thirtieth of June arrived at a small river, called Cathawhachaga,[35]  which empties itself into a large lake called Yath-kyed-whoie,[36] or  White Snow Lake. Here we found several tents of Northern Indians, who  had been some time employed spearing deer in their canoes, as they  crossed the above mentioned little river. Here also we met a Northern  Indian Leader, or Captain, called Keelshies, and a small party of his  crew, who were bound to Prince of Wales's Fort, with furs {36} and other  commodities for trade. When Keelshies was made acquainted with the  intent of my journey, he readily offered his service to bring me  anything from the Factory that we were likely to stand in need of; and  though we were then in latitude 63 deg. 4' North, and longitude 7 deg. 12' West  from Churchill, yet he promised to join us again, at a place appointed  by my guide, by the setting in of the Winter. In consequence of this  offer, I looked over our ammunition and other articles; and finding that  a little powder, shot, tobacco, and a few knives were likely to be of  service before the journey could be completed, I determined to send a  letter to the governor of Prince of Wales's Fort, to advise him of my  situation, and to desire him to send by the bearer a certain quantity of  the above articles; on which Keelshies and his crew proceeded on their  journey for the Factory the same day.    [Illustration: MAP OF YATH-KYED LAKE AND PART OF KAZAN RIVER  By J. B. Tyrrell, 1894]    [Sidenote: 1770. July.]    Cathawhachaga was the only river we had seen since the breaking up of  the ice that we could not ford; and as we had not any canoes with us, we  were obliged to get ferried across by the strange Indians. When we  arrived on the North side of this river, where the Indians resided, my  guide proposed to stop some time, to dry and pound some meat to take  with us; to which I readily consented. We also set our fishing-nets, and  caught a considerable quantity of very fine fish; such as tittemeg,  barble,[37] &c.    [Sidenote: 6th.]    {37} The number of deer which crossed Cathawhachaga, during our stay  there, was by no means equal to our expectations, and no more than just  sufficient to supply our present wants; so that after waiting several  days in fruitless expectation, we began to prepare for moving; and  accordingly, on the sixth of July, we set out, though we had not at that  time as much victuals belonging to our company as would furnish us a  supper. During our stay here, we had each day got as much fish or flesh  as was sufficient for present expenditure; but, being in hopes of better  times, saved none.    Before we left Cathawhachaga, I made several observations for the  latitude, and found it to be 63 deg. 4' North.[38] I also brought up my  journal, and filled up my chart to that time. Everything being now ready  for our departure, my guide informed me that in a few days a canoe would  be absolutely necessary, to enable us to cross some unfordable rivers  which we should meet, and could not avoid. This induced me to purchase  one at the easy rate of a single knife, the full value of which did not  exceed one penny. It must be observed, that the man who sold the canoe  had no farther occasion for it, and was glad to take what he could get;  but had he been thoroughly acquainted with our necessities, he most  assuredly would have had the conscience to have asked goods to the  amount of ten beaver skins at least.    [Sidenote: 1770. July.]    [Sidenote: 9th.]    {38} This additional piece of luggage obliged me to engage another  Indian; and we were lucky enough at that time to meet with a poor  forlorn fellow, who was fond of the office, having never been in a much  better state than that of a beast of burthen. Thus, provided with a  canoe, and a man to carry it, we left Cathawhachaga, as has been  observed, on the sixth of July, and continued our course to the North by  West, and North North West; and that night put up by the side of a small  bay of White Snow Lake,[39] where we angled, and caught several fine  trout, some of which weighed not less than fourteen or sixteen pounds.  In the night heavy rain came on, which continued three days; but the  ninth proving fine weather, and the sun displaying his beams very  powerfully, we dried our clothes, and proceeded to the Northward. Toward  the evening, however, it began again to rain so excessively, that it was  with much difficulty we kept our powder and books dry.    [Sidenote: 17th.]    On the seventeenth, we saw many musk-oxen, several of which the Indians  killed; when we agreed to stay here a day or two, to dry and pound[U]  some of the carcases to take with us. The flesh of any animal, when it  is thus prepared, is not only hearty food, but is always ready for {39}  use, and at the same time very portable. In most parts of Hudson's Bay  it is known by the name of Thew-hagon,[40] but amongst the Northern  Indians it is called Achees.    [Sidenote: 1770. July. 22d.]    Having prepared as much dried flesh as we could transport, we proceeded  to the Northward; and at our departure left a great quantity of meat  behind us, which we could neither eat nor carry away. This was not the  first time we had so done; and however wasteful it may appear, it is a  practice so common among all the Indian tribes, as to be thought nothing  of. On the twenty-second, we met several strangers, whom we joined in  pursuit of the deer, &c. which were at this time so plentiful, that we  got every day a sufficient number for our support, and indeed too  frequently killed several merely for the tongues, marrow, and fat.    [Sidenote: 30th.]    [Sidenote: 1770. August.]    After we had been some time in company with those Indians, I found that  my guide seemed to hesitate about proceeding any farther; and that he  kept pitching his tent backward and forward, from place to place, after  the deer, and the rest of the Indians. On my asking him his reason for  so doing; he answered, that as the year was too far advanced to admit of  our arrival at the Coppermine River that Summer, he thought it more  advisable to pass the Winter with some of the Indians then in company,  and alleged that there could be no fear of our arriving at that river  early in the Summer of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-one. As I  could not {40} pretend to contradict him, I was entirely reconciled to  his proposal; and accordingly we kept moving to the Westward with the  other Indians. In a few days, many others joined us from different  quarters; so that by the thirtieth of July we had in all above seventy  tents, which did not contain less than six hundred persons. Indeed our  encampment at night had the appearance of a small town; and in the  morning, when we began to move, the whole ground (at least for a large  space all round) seemed to be alive, with men, women, children, and  dogs. Though the land was entirely barren, and destitute of every kind  of herbage, except wish-a-capucca[V] and moss, yet the deer were so  numerous that the Indians not only killed as many as were sufficient for  our large number, but often several merely for the skins, marrow, &c.  and left the carcases to rot, or to be devoured by the wolves, foxes,  and other beasts of prey.    [Illustration: MAP OF DUBAWNT LAKE AND PART OF DUBAWNT RIVER  By J. B. and J. W. Tyrrell, 1893]    In our way to the Westward we came to several rivers, which, though  small and of no note, were so deep as not to be fordable, particularly  Doobaunt River.[W] On those occasions only, we had recourse to our  canoe, which, though of the common size, was too small to carry more  {41}"]]]
