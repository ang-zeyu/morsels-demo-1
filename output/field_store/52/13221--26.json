Well, 'tis Fra Capello, I tell thee, an  astrologer, a diviner by the stars--do I not aver it, though I have  never set eyes on the man before?'    'How know'st, then?'    'Why, true, my perspicacity is only this and that, a poor matter of  inferences.  As, for example, the inference of the fingers, that when I  burn them, fire is near; or the inference of the nose, that when I smell  cooking fish, it is a fast day; or the inference of the palate, that  when I drink water, I am a fool.'    'A dear wise fool.'    'Ay, a wise fool, to know what one and one make. Dost thou?'    'Two, to be sure.'    'Well, God fit thy perspicacity with twins, when thy time comes.  One  out of one and one is enough for me.'    'Peace!  How know'st this holy father is an astrologer?'    'Inference, sir--merely inference.  As, for example again, the inference  of the ears, that when I mark the substance of his whisper to thee, I  seem to remember talk of a certain Franciscan, who, having predicted by  the stars short shrift for Galeazzo, and been invited to come and  discuss his reasons, did prove unaccountably coy, though certainly seer  to his own nativity.  Imprimis, the astrologer was reported a Conventual  and fat; whereby comes in the inference of the eye.  Now, \"Ho-ho!\"  thinks I, \"this same swag-bellied monk who babbles of stars!  Surely it  is our Fra Capello?  And hooked at last?  By what killing bait?\"'    Here he had touched the boy's shoulder swiftly, and as swiftly had  withdrawn his hand, an ineffable expression, shrewd and caustic,  puckering his face.  Bembo had looked serious.    'Cicca!  I do believe thou art madder than any astrologer--unless----'    'No!' had cried the Fool; 'I am sober; wrong me not.'    Then Bembo had repented lovingly:--    'Pardon, dear Cicca.  But, indeed, I understand thee not.'    'Why,' I said, 'what killing bait had tempted the monk's shyness at  length?'    'What, then?'    'Thyself.'    'I?'    'Art thou not a star-child and Galeazzo's protege? O, pretty, sweet  decoy, to draw the astrologer from his cloister!'    'Dost mean that the Duke would use me to question the truth of these  predictions?  Alas! not I, nor any man, can interpret nothingness into a  text.'    'Wilt thou tell him so?'    'Who?'    'The Duke.'    'I have told him so.'    'Thou hast?  Then God keep the Franciscan in breath!'    'Amen!' had said Bembo, in all fervour and innocence. He had thought the  other to mean nothing more than that the Duke was designing, on _his_  authority, to win a faulty brother from the heresy--as he construed  it--of divination.    As _he_ construed it.  Young and inexperienced as he was, he had yet a  prophet's purpose and vision--the vision which, in despite of all  traditional beliefs, looks backwards.  His soft eyes were steadfast to  that end which was the beginning.  No sophistries could beguile him from  the essential truth of his kind creed.  _He_ was an atavism of something  vastly remoter than Caligula--than any tyranny.  He 'threw back' to the  stock of those first angels who knew the daughters of men--to the first  fruits of an amazed and incredible sorrow.  By so great a step was he  close to the God his sires had offended; was close to the parting of the  ways between earth and heaven, and with all the lore of the  since-accumulated ages to instruct him in his choice of roads. O,  believe little Bernardo that his was the true insight, the true wisdom!  There is no Future, nor ever will be. The past but prolongs itself to  the present; and all enterprise, all yearning, are but to recover the  ground we have lost.  That truth once recognised, the horror of Futurity  shall close its gates; its timeless wastes shall be no more to us; and  we--we shall be wandering back, by aeons of pathetic memories, to trace  to its source the love that gushed in Paradise.    Three days later the boy--the Duke being gone--was strolling, again with  Cicada his shadow, on the ramparts. It had become something his habit to  take the air, after hearing the morning causes, on these outer walls,  whence the tired vision could stretch itself luxuriantly on leagues of  peaceful plain.  He liked then to be left alone, or at the most to the  sole company of his dogged henchman, the erst Fool.  Cicada's gruff but  jealous sympathy was an emollient to lacerated sensibilities; his wit  was a tonic; his tact the fruit of long necessity.  No one would have  guessed, not gentle Bernardo himself, how the little, ugly, caustic  creature was, when most wilful or eccentric in seeming, watching over  and medicining his moods of inevitable weariness or depression.    Perhaps he was in such a mood now--induced by that passion of the  irremediable which occasionally must overtake every just judge--as he  leaned upon the battlements, his cheek propped on his palm, and gazed  out dreamily over the shining campagna.    'Cicca,' he said suddenly, 'what made thee a Fool?'    'Circumstance,' answered the other promptly.    'Ah!' sighed Bembo--'that blind brute force of Nature, wavering out of  chaos.  No agent of God--His foe, rather, to be anticipated and  circumvented.  Providence is the true wise name for our Master.  He  _provideth_, of the immensity of His love, for and against.  He can do  no further, nor foretell but by analogy the blundering spites of  Circumstance.  But always He persuades the monster of his interest lying  more and more in sweet order--dreams of him sleeping caged, a lazy,  satiated chimera, in the mid-gardens of love.'    'Che allegria!' said Cicada; 'I will go then, and poke him in the ribs,  and ask him why he made a Fool of me.'    Bembo smiled and sighed.    'There is a proof of his blindness.  What, in truth, was thy origin,  dear Cicca?'    The Fool came and leaned beside him.    'Canst look on me and ask?  I was born in this dark age of tyranny, and  of it; I shall die in it and of it.  I have never known liberty.  Sobriety and reason are empty terms to me.  Ask of me no fruit but the  fruit of mine inheritance.  A drunken woman in labour will bring forth a  drunken child.  I am Cicada the Fool, lower than a slave, curst pimp to  Folly.'    Soft as a butterfly, Bernardo's hand fluttered to his shoulder and  rested there.  The creature's dim eyes were fixed upon the crawling  plain; his face worked with emotion.    'There was a time,' he said, 'I understand, when governments were loyal  at once to the individual and the state--when they wrought for the  common weal.  In those days, it would seem certain, riches--anything  above a specified income--must have disqualified a man for office.  It  is the ideal constitution.  Corruption will enter else.  Wealth, and the  emulation of wealth, are the moth in stored states.  That was the age of  the republics and all the virtues.  I am born, alack, after my time.  I  have held Esau the first saint in the calendar.  I am not sure I do not  do so now, Messer Bembo despite.'    'And I, too, love Esau,' said Bernardo quietly.    Cicada, amazed, whipped upon him; then suddenly seized him in his arms.    'Thou dearest, most loving of babes!' he cried rapturously; 'sweet saint  of all to me!  What! did I twit thee, mine emancipator, with my curse to  thralldom? Loves Esau, quotha!  No cant his creed.  Child, thou art  asphodel to that cactus.  Put thy foot on this mouth that could so  slander thee!'    'Poor Cicca!' said Bembo, gently disengaging himself. 'Thou rebukest  sweetly my idle curiosity.'    'Curiosity!' cried the other.  'Would the angels always showed as much!  Thou art welcome to all of me I can tell:--as, for example, that my  mother--_exitus acta probat_--was a fool, a sweet, pretty, vicious fool;  and yet, after all, not such a fool as, having borne, to acknowledge  me.'    'Poor wretch!  Why not?'    'Why not?  Why, for the reason Pasiphae concealed her share in the  Minotaur.  Motley is the labyrinth of Milan.  My father was a bull.'    'Well, I am answered.'    'Ah! thou think'st I jest.  Relatively--relatively only, sir, I assure  thee.  Hast ever heard speak of Filippo Maria, the last of the  Visconti?'    'Little, alas! to his credit.'    'I will answer in my person to that.  He was uglier than any bull--a  monster so hideous as to be attractive to a certain order of frailty.  I  inclined his way. Perhaps that was my salvation.  The child most  interests the parent whose features it reflects.  It is bad-luck to  break a mirror; and so I was spared--for the labyrinth.'    'O infamous!  He made thee his jester?'    'And fed me.  Let that be remembered to him. When the reckoning comes,  the bull, not Pasiphae, shall have my voice.'    'Hideous!  Thy mother?'    'Let it pass on that.  I need say no more, if a word can damn.'    'Cicca!'    'He was meat and drink to me, I say.'    'Drink, alas!'    'He meant it kindly.  When I sparkled, 'twas his own wit he felt himself  applauding.  That was my easy time.  He died in '47, and my majesty's  Fooldom was appropriated incontinent to the titillation of these  peasants of Cotignola their hairy ears.'    'Hush, and thou wilt be wise!'    'In my grave, not sooner.  Francesco, our Magnificent's father, was  so-so for humour--a good, blunt soldier, who'd take his cue of laughter  from some quicker wit, then roar it out despotically.  No sniggerer,  like his son, who qualifies all praise with envy.  Shall I tell thee how  I lost Galeazzo's favour?  He wrote a sonnet. 'Twas an achievement.  A  Roman triumph has been ceded to less--hardly to worse.  Lord, sir! there  was that applause and hand-clapping at Court!

Not only,       indeed, has your Ladyship been bereaved of a rare friend       and relative, a most wise and religious gentleman, but,       as you observe, all Christendom has thus sustained a loss       incomparably great in times so evil and convulsed. Of       myself I shall say little, having already written a few       days ago to your Excellency; and, knowing the affection       and respect mutually existing between you, I appreciate       the weight of your grief from my own. Nor can I doubt       that your Ladyship is aware of my emotion consequent upon       his long kindness towards me, and my respectful but warm       affection for him, sentiments never interrupted by a single       word on either side, from his early youth and my manly age       down to this day. I am further pained to observe that your       Ladyship, lamenting for long years your Lord's death of       happy memory, and now that of the Cardinal, entertains an       impression your life will be short. This is no fruit of       that good sense I have ever noticed in you, and which the       Cardinal himself inculcated; for the more your Ladyship       is left alone to promote the welfare and advantage of the       tender plants by your side, you should be more anxious to       live on; for, while life is given you, you may benefit       their souls by prayers and good deeds, as well as promote       the interests of many who look to your pious spirit for the       prosperity of their lot. Let not, therefore, your Ladyship       speak thus, but bless (_si conforti_) the Heavenly King       that he has so willed it, and conform yourself to his       infallible will and judgment. As to your observation that       I am left to you, in place of this good gentleman, as a       protector, father, and brother, be assured that the day       shall never come when it will not be my desire to dispose       of myself in all respects according to your Excellency's       pleasure, yielding therein not even to your [late] most       reverend brother. Your Ladyship will consider me as truly,       really, and justly your own, to use and dispose of me       unreservedly; and for this end I give, grant, and give over       to you full leave and power, not to be reclaimed by any       change of fortune so long as life remains to me. In return       I shall now pray you to attend to your health, and not only       to live on, but live as happily as you can, thus avenging       yourself of fate, which has done so much to vex you....

VIII., p. 3.]           *       *       *       *       *    PIETRO BEMBO[*44] was born at Venice in 1470, and had the  first rudiments of education at Florence, whither his father Bernardo  was sent as ambassador from the Signory. Having learned Greek at  Messina under Constantin Lascaris, and studied philosophy at Padua  and Ferrara, he devoted himself to literary pursuits. At the court  of the d'Este princes, where he was introduced by his father then  resident as envoy from Venice, he met with the consideration  due to his acquirements, and found a brilliant society, including  Sadoleto, the Strozzi, and Tibaldeo. There he was residing when the  arrival of Lucrezia Borgia threatened to establish for it a very  different character; but the dissolute beauty seems to have left  in the Vatican her abandoned tastes, and adopting those of her new  sovereignty she became distinguished as a patroness of letters.  The intimacy which sprang up between this princess and Bembo has  given rise to some controversy as to the purity of its platonism, a  discussion into which we need not enter. The life of the lady, the  writings of the Abbe, and the morals of their time combine to justify  suspicion, where proofs can hardly be looked for.[*45]         \"But if their solemn love were crime,         Pity the beauty and the sage,--         Their crime was in their darkened age!\"    [Footnote *44: For a splendid account of Bembo, cf. GASPARY,  _Storia della Lett. Ital._ (Torino, 1891), vol. II., part II., pp.  60-7, and the _Appendice Bibliographica_ there, pp. 284-5.]    [Footnote *45: This is altogether unfair, uncalled for, and untrue.  Dennistoun is not to be trusted where a Borgia is concerned; like  Sigismondo Malatesta they hurt the Urbino dukes too much.]    [Illustration: _Anon. des._ _L. Ceroni sculp._    CARDINAL BEMBO    _From a drawing once in the possession of Cavaliere Agricola in Rome_]    Their correspondence lasted from 1503 to 1516, and many of his  letters are published.[*46] The prevailing tone of these is  rhetorical rather than passionate, and is quite as complimentary  to her virtues as to her beauty. The Ambrosian Library at Milan  possesses nine autograph epistles in Italian and Latin from Lucrezia,  addressed \"to my dearest M. Pietro Bembo,\" with the dates supplied in  his hand. A tress of fair auburn hair, originally tied up with them,  and doubtless that of the Princess, is now shown in the adjoining  museum. That her tastes and accomplishments were not unworthy of such  a friendship appears from many dedications of works to her while  Duchess of Ferrara, including the Asolani of her admirer.    [Footnote *46: Cf. MORSOLIN, _P. Bembo e Lucrezia Borgia_,  in the _Nuova Antologia_ (Roma, 1885), and BEMBO, _Opere_  (Venice, 1729), vol. III., pp. 307-17; also CIAN, in _Giorn.  Stor. della Lett. Ital._, XXIX., 425.]    In 1505 Bembo repaired to Urbino, and sojourned chiefly at that court  during the next six years, where his varied attainments were highly  prized, and where his philological pedantry was probably regarded  as ornamental. Besides enjoying the converse of many congenial  spirits, he there formed a friendship with Giuliano de' Medici, to  which he owed many subsequent honours. Accompanying him to Rome in  1512, he was recommended by him to his brother, the Cardinal, whose  first act on being chosen Pope in the following year, was to name  Bembo his secretary, jointly with his friend Sadoleto. For this  situation he was in many respects well fitted, by the happy union  of great learning with an extensive knowledge of men and manners,  which his residence at Ferrara and Urbino had not failed to impart.  The laxity of his morals, and the paganism of his ideas, were  unfortunately no disqualifications under Leo X. He continued to earn  his master's confidence in the discharge of his regular duties, as  well as in occasional diplomatic missions, but, as Roscoe truly  observes, his success as a negotiator did not equal his ability in  official correspondence. The pensions and benefices which rewarded  his services enriched him for life, and even before that Pontiff's  death he sought at Padua an elegant literary retirement, refusing  from Clement VII., and from the Signory of Venice, all offers of  public employment. He surrounded himself with a most select library,  including many invaluable manuscripts, and a precious collection  of medals and other antiquities, which, with the society of the  learned whom he attracted to his board, gave to his house a wide  celebrity. It was not regarded as at all degraded by the presence  of an avowed mistress at its head, with whom he openly lived for  many years, and had several children; and neither this scandal,  nor the gross indecency of some of his writings, prevented Paul  III. from conferring upon him a scarlet hat in 1539. He is said to  have accepted this dignity unwillingly, but having done so, he had  the good sense at all events to \"cleanse the outside of the cup  and platter.\" His mistress was now dead; he laid aside poetry,  literature, and pagan idioms, and, devoting himself to theological  studies, at which he had formerly sneered in the habit of an abbe,  he entered holy orders at the mature age of sixty-nine. In 1541 he  succeeded Fregoso, his early companion at Urbino, in the bishopric  of Gubbio, to which was added that of Bergamo. How little these  preferments contributed to his comfort appears from a letter to  Veronica Gambara in December, 1543. \"Often,\" he there says, \"do I  desire to be the unfettered Bembo of other days, rather than as  I now am. But what better can one make of it? Man's existence,  abounding more in crosses than in gratifying incidents, will have it  so; and wiser he who least desponds and best puts up to necessity,  than one that less conforms to it. Yet I own myself unable to do  this amid these privations, and exiled in a manner from myself.  For verily I am neither at Venice nor Padua, as your Ladyship  supposes, but at my church of Gubbio, a very wild place to say the  truth, and offering few conveniences.\" He died at Rome six years  after, in his seventy-seventh year, and was buried in the church of  the Minerva, between his patrons Leo X. and Clement VII., where a  modest flag-stone is all the memorial that his natural son and heir,  Torquato, bestowed on one of the most famous men of his age.           *       *       *       *       *    At the town of Bibbiena, in the upper Val d'Arno, there were born  about 1470, of humble parentage, two brothers, whose business talents  procured them remarkable advancement. The elder, Pietro Dovizi,  became a secretary of Lorenzo de' Medici, into whose family he  introduced his brother BERNARDO. There this youth gained  for himself so good a reputation,"]]]
