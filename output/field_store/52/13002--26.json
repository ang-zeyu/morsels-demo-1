In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the    titular heads of state retained, but the government transformed into    a parliamentary democracy. Long isolated and impoverished,    mountainous Andorra achieved considerable prosperity since World War    II through its tourist industry. Many immigrants (legal and illegal)    are attracted to the thriving economy with its lack of income taxes.

Algeria has the seventh-largest reserves of natural    gas in the world and is the second-largest gas exporter; it ranks    14th in oil reserves. Economic policy reforms supported by the IMF    and debt rescheduling from the Paris Club in the past decade have    helped improve Algeria's financial and macroeconomic indicators.    Because of sustained high oil prices in the past three years,    Algeria's finances have further benefited from substantial trade    surpluses and record foreign exchange reserves. Real GDP has risen    due to higher oil output and increased government spending. The    government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by    attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy    sector, however, has had little success in reducing high    unemployment and improving living standards.
