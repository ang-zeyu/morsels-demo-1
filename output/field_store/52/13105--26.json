As they prayed by the side of the little bed where the body of the  child lay, they thought something moved, and to their joy and surprise  the boy opened his eyes and sat up, and in a short time was as well  as ever.    They asked him eagerly what had happened, and he told them all about  the pilgrim with the queer feet and hands, who had gone with him to  the fountain and had then thrown back his hood and shown his terrible  face. After that he could remember nothing until he found himself in a  beautiful garden, where the loveliest flowers grew. There were lilies  like white stars, and roses far more beautiful than any he had ever  seen in his own garden, and the leaves of the trees shone like silver  and gold. It was all so beautiful that for a while he forgot his home,  and when he did remember and tried to find his way back, he grew  bewildered and did not know in what direction to turn. As he was  looking about, an old man came down the garden path and smiled so  kindly upon him that he trusted him at once. This old man was dressed  in the robes of a bishop, and had a long white beard and the sweetest  old face the child had ever seen.    \"Art thou searching for the way home?\" the old man asked. \"Dost thou  wish to leave this beautiful garden and go back to thy father and  mother?\"    \"I want to go home,\" said the child, with a sob in his voice, \"but I  cannot find the way, and I am, oh, so tired of searching for it.\"    Then the old man stooped down and lifted him in his arms, and the  child laid his head on the old man's shoulder, and, weary with his  wandering, fell fast asleep and remembered nothing more till he woke  up in his own little bed.    Then the parents knew that Saint Nicholas had heard their prayers and  had gone to fetch the child from the Heavenly Garden and brought him  back to them.    So they were more grateful to the good saint than ever, and they loved  and honoured him even more than they had done before; which was all  the reward the demon got for his wicked doings.    That is one of the many stories told after the death of Saint  Nicholas, and it ever helped and comforted his people to think that,  though they could no longer see him he would love and protect them  still.    Young maidens in need of help remembered the story of the golden bars  and felt sure the good saint would not let them want. Sailors tossing  on the stormy waves thought of that storm which had sunk to rest at  the prayer of Saint Nicholas. Poor prisoners with no one to take their  part were comforted by the thought of those other prisoners whom he  had saved. And little children perhaps have remembered him most of  all, for when the happy Christmas time draws near, who is so much in  their thoughts as Saint Nicholas, or Santa Claus, as they call him?  Perhaps they are a little inclined to think of him as some good  magician who comes to fill their stockings with gifts, but they should  never forget that he was the kind bishop who, in olden days, loved to  make the little ones happy. There are some who think that even now he  watches over and protects little children, and for that reason he is  called their patron saint.          CHRISTMAS BELLS          I heard the bells on Christmas Day      Their old, familiar carols play,          And wild and sweet          The words repeat      Of peace on earth, good-will to men!                            Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.          A NIGHT WITH SANTA CLAUS    Anna R. Annan      Not very long ago, and not far from here, lived a little boy named  Bobby Morgan. Now I must tell at once how Bobby looked, else how will  you know him if you meet him in the street? Blue-eyed was Rob, and  fair-haired, and pug-nosed--just the sweetest trifle, his mother said.    Well, the day before Christmas, Rob thought it would be a fine thing  to run down Main Street and see what was going on. After dinner his  mother put on his fur cap and bright scarf, and filled his pockets  with crackers and cookies. She told him to be very polite to Santa  Claus if he should happen to meet him.    Off he trotted, merry as a cricket, with now a skip and now a slide.  At every corner he held his breath, half expecting to run into Santa  himself. Nothing of the sort happened, however, and he soon found  himself before the gay windows of a toy shop.    There he saw a spring hobby-horse, as large as a Shetland pony, all  saddled and bridled, too,--lacking nothing but a rider. Rob pressed  his nose against the glass, and tried to imagine the feelings of a boy  in that saddle. He must have stood there all day, had not a ragged  little fellow pulled his coat. \"Wouldn't you jist like that popgun?\"  he piped.    \"Catch me looking at popguns!\" said Rob shortly. But when he saw how  tattered the boy's jacket was he said more softly, \"P'r'raps you'd  like a cooky.\"    \"Try me wunst!\" said the shrill little voice.    There was a queer lump in Rob's throat as he emptied one pocket of its  cakes and thrust them into the dirty, eager hands. Then he marched  down the street without so much as glancing at that glorious steed  again.    Brighter and brighter grew the windows, more and more full of toys. At  last our boy stood, with open eyes and mouth, before a great store  lighted from top to bottom, for it was growing dark. Rob came near  taking off his cap and saying, \"How do you do, sir?\"    To whom, you ask. Why, to an image of Santa Claus, the size of life,  holding a Christmas tree filled with wonderful fruit.    Soon a happy thought struck Rob. \"Surely this must be Santa Claus's  own store, where he comes to fill his basket with toys! What if I were  to hide there and wait for him?\"    As I said, he was a brave little chap, and he walked straight into the  store with the stream of big people. Everybody was busy. No one had  time to look at our mite of a Rob. He tried in vain to find a quiet  corner, till he caught sight of some winding stairs that led up to the  next story. He crept up, scarcely daring to breathe.    What a fairyland! Toys everywhere! Oceans of toys! Nothing but toys,  excepting one happy little boy. Think of fifty great rocking-horses in  a pile; of whole flocks of woolly sheep and curly dogs with the real  bark in them; stacks of drums; regiments of soldiers armed to the  teeth; companies of firemen drawing their hose carts; no end of  wheelbarrows and velocipedes!    Rob screwed his knuckles into his eyes, as a gentle hint that they had  better not play him any tricks, and then stared with might and main.    Suddenly Rob thought he heard a footstep on the stairs. Fearing to be  caught, he hid behind a baby-wagon. No one came, however, and as he  felt rather hungry, he took out the remaining cakes and had a fine  supper.    Why didn't Santa Claus come?    Rob was really getting sleepy. He stretched out his tired legs, and,  turning one of the woolly sheep on its side, pillowed his curly head  upon it. It was so nice to lie there, looking up at the ceiling hung  with toys, and with the faint hum of voices in his ears. The blue eyes  grew more and more heavy. Rob was fast asleep.    Midnight! The bells rang loud and clear, as if they had great news to  tell the world. What noise is that besides the bells? And look, oh,  look! Who is that striding up the room with a great basket on his  back? He has stolen his coat from a polar bear, and his cap, too, I  declare! His boots are of red leather and reach to his knees. His coat  and cap are trimmed with wreaths of holly, bright with scarlet  berries.    Good sir, let us see your face--why! that is the best part of him,--so  round, and so ruddy, such twinkling eyes, and such a merry look about  those dimples! But see his long white beard; can he be old?    Oh, very, very old. Over nineteen hundred years. Is that not a long  life, little ones? But he has a young heart, this dear old man, and a  kind one. Can you guess his name? \"Hurrah for Santa Claus!\" Right--the  very one.    He put his basket down near Robby, and with his back turned to him  shook the snow from his fur coat. Some of the flakes fell on Rob's  face and roused him from his sleep. Opening his eyes, he saw the white  figure, but did not stir nor cry out, lest the vision should vanish.    But bless his big heart! He had no idea of vanishing till his night's  work was done. He took a large book from his pocket, opened to the  first page, and looked at it very closely.    \"Tommy Turner,\" was written at the top, and just below was a little  map--yes, there was Tommy's heart mapped out like a country. Part of  the land was marked good, part of it bad. Here and there were little  flags to point out places where battles had been fought during the  year. Some of them were black and some white; wherever a good feeling  had won the fight there was a white one.    \"Tommy Turner,\" said Santa Claus aloud, \"six white flags, three black  ones. That leaves only three presents for Tommy; but we must see what  can be done for him.\"    So he bustled among the toys, and soon had a ball, a horse, and a  Noah's ark tied up in a parcel, which he tossed into the basket.    Name after name was read off, some of them belonging to Rob's  playmates, and you may be sure that the little boy listened with his  heart in his mouth.    \"Robby Morgan!\" said Santa Claus.    In his excitement that small lad nearly upset the cart, but Santa did  not notice it.    \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven\"--Rob's breath came very  short--\"whites!\"    He almost clapped his hands.    \"One, two, three, blacks! Now I wonder what that little chap would  like--here's a drum, a box of tools, a knife, a menagerie. If he  hadn't run away from school that day and then told a lie about it I'd  give him a rocking-horse.\"    Rob groaned in anguish of spirit.    \"But, bless him! he's a fine little fellow, and perhaps he will do  better next year if I give him the horse.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#19)"],[1,"ek-          ing the material more than the spiritual. His  85:27   thrusts at materialism were sharp, but needed. He never          spared hypocrisy the sternest condemnation.. He said:          \"These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other  85:30   undone.\" The great Teacher knew both cause and          effect, knew that truth communicates itself but never          imparts error.                                 Mental contact    86:1    Jesus once asked, \"Who touched me?\" Supposing          this inquiry to be occasioned by physical contact alone,  86:3    his disciples answered, \"The multitude throng          thee.\" Jesus knew, as others did not, that          it was not matter, but mortal mind, whose touch called  86:6    for aid. Repeating his inquiry, he was answered by the          faith of a sick woman. His quick apprehension of this          mental call illustrated his spirituality. The disciples'  86:9    misconception of it uncovered their materiality. Jesus          possessed more spiritual susceptibility than the disciples.          Opposites come from contrary directions, and produce  86:12   unlike results.                                Images of thought            Mortals evolve images of thought. These may appear          to the ignorant to be apparitions; but they are myste-  86:15   rious only because it is unusual to see          thoughts, though we can always feel their          influence. Haunted houses, ghostly voices, unusual  86:18   noises, and apparitions brought out in dark seances          either involve feats by tricksters, or they are images and          sounds evolved involuntarily by mortal mind. Seeing  86:21   is no less a quality of physical sense than feeling. Then          why is it more difficult to see a thought than to feel one?          Education alone determines the difference. In reality  86:24   there is none.                               Phenomena explained            Portraits, landscape-paintings, fac-similes of penman-          ship, peculiarities of expression, recollected sentences,  86:27   can all be taken from pictorial thought and          memory as readily as from objects cognizable          by the senses. Mortal mind sees what it believes as  86:30   certainly as it believes what it sees. It feels, hears, and          sees its own thoughts. Pictures are mentally formed          before the artist can convey them to canvas. So is it  87:1    with all material conceptions. Mind-readers perceive          these pictures of thought. They copy or reproduce  87:3    them, even when they are lost to the memory of the mind          in which they are discoverable.                               Mental environment            It is needless for the thought or for the person hold-  87:6    ing the transferred picture to be individually and con-          sciously present. Though individuals have          passed away, their mental environment re-  87:9    mains to be discerned, described, and transmitted. Though          bodies are leagues apart and their associations forgotten,          their associations float in the general atmosphere of human  87:12   mind.                                  Second sight            The Scotch call such vision \"second sight\", when          really it is first sight instead of second, for it presents  87:15   primal facts to mortal mind. Science enables          one to read the human mind, but not as a          clairvoyant. It enables one to heal through Mind, but  87:18   not as a mesmerist.                                 Buried secrets            The mine knows naught of the emeralds within its          rocks; the sea is ignorant of the gems within its caverns,  87:21   of the corals, of its sharp reefs, of the tall ships          that float on its bosom, or of the bodies which          lie buried in its sands: yet these are all there. Do not  87:24   suppose that any mental concept is gone because you do          not think of it. The true concept is never lost. The          strong impressions produced on mortal mind by friend-  87:27   ship or by any intense feeling are lasting, and mind-          readers can perceive and reproduce these impressions.                               Recollected friends            Memory may reproduce voices long ago silent. We  87:30   have but to close the eyes, and forms rise          before us, which are thousands of miles away          or altogether gone from physical sight and sense, and  88:1    this not in dreamy sleep. In our day-dreams we can          recall that for which the poet Tennyson expressed the  88:3    heart's desire, -               the touch of a vanished hand,             And the sound of a voice that is still.    88:6    The mind may even be cognizant of a present flavor and          odor, when no viand touches the palate and no scent          salutes the nostrils.                               Illusions not ideas    88:9    How are veritable ideas to be distinguished from il-          lusions? By learning the origin of each. Ideas are          emanations from the divine Mind. Thoughts,  88:12   proceeding from the brain or from matter, are          offshoots of mortal mind; they are mortal material be-          liefs. Ideas are spiritual, harmonious, and eternal. Beliefs  88:15   proceed from the so-called material senses, which at one          time are supposed to be substance-matter and at another          are called spirits.    88:18   To love one's neighbor as one's self, is a divine idea;          but this idea can never be seen, felt, nor understood          through the physical senses. Excite the organ of ven-  88:21   eration or religious faith, and the individual manifests          profound adoration. Excite the opposite development,          and he blasphemes. These effects, however, do not pro-  88:24   ceed from Christianity, nor are they spiritual phenomena,          for both arise from mortal belief.                            Trance speaking illusion            Eloquence re-echoes the strains of Truth and Love.  88:27   It is due to inspiration rather than to erudition. It shows          the possibilities derived from divine Mind,          though it is said to be a gift whose endowment  88:30   is obtained from books or received from the          impulsion of departed spirits. When eloquence proceeds          from the belief that a departed spirit is speaking, who  89:1    can tell what the unaided medium is incapable of know-          ing or uttering? This phenomenon only shows that the  89:3    beliefs of mortal mind are loosed. Forgetting her igno-          rance in the belief that another mind is speaking through          her, the devotee may become unwontedly eloquent. Hav-  89:6    ing more faith in others than in herself, and believing          that somebody else possesses her tongue and mind, she          talks freely.    89:9    Destroy her belief in outside aid, and her eloquence          disappears. The former limits of her belief return. She          says, \" I am incapable of words that glow, for I am un-  89:12   educated.\" This familiar instance reaffirms the Scrip-          tural word concerning a man, \"As he thinketh in his heart,          so is he.\" If one believes that he cannot be an orator with-  89:15   out study or a superinduced condition, the body responds          to this belief, and the tongue grows mute which before          was eloquent.                            Scientific improvisation    89:18   Mind is not necessarily dependent upon educational          processes. It possesses of itself all beauty and poetry,          and the power of expressing them. Spirit,  89:21   God, is heard when the senses are silent. We          are all capable of more than we do. The influence or          action of Soul confers a freedom, which explains the phe-  89:24   nomena of improvisation and the fervor of untutored lips.                               Divine origination            Matter is neither intelligent nor creative. The tree is          not the author of itself. Sound is not the originator of  89:27   music, and man is not the father of man. Cain          very naturally concluded that if life was in the          body, and man gave it, man had the right to take it away.  89:30   This incident shows that the belief of life in matter was          \"a murderer from the beginning.\"            If seed is necessary to produce wheat, and wheat to  90:1    produce flour, or if one animal can originate another,          how then can we account for their primal origin? How  90:3    were the loaves and fishes multiplied on the shores of          Galilee, - and that, too, without meal or monad from          which loaf or fish could come?                                Mind is substance    90:6    The earth's orbit and the imaginary line called the          equator are not substance. The earth's motion and          position are sustained by Mind alone. Divest  90:9    yourself of the thought that there can be sub-          stance in matter, and the movements and transitions now          possible for mortal mind will be found to be equally  90:12   possible for the body. Then being will be recognized          as spiritual, and death will be obsolete, though now          some insist that death is the necessary prelude to  90:15   immortality.                                Mortal delusions            In dreams we fly to Europe and meet a far-off friend.          The looker-on sees the body in bed, but the supposed  90:18   inhabitant of that body carries it through          the air and over the ocean. This shows the          possibilities of thought. Opium and hashish eaters men-  90:21   tally travel far and work wonders, yet their bodies stay          in one place. This shows what mortal mentality and          knowledge are.                              Scientific finalities    90:24   The admission to one's self that man is God's own like-    "]]]
