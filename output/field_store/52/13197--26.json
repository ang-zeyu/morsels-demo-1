On the other hand, the spiritual power is an exceeding great blessing,  and far too precious in His eyes, that the very least of Christians  should endure and keep silent, if it departs a hair's breadth from its  own duty, not to say when it does the very opposite of its duty, as we  now see it do every day.    XIV. In this power also there is much abuse. First, when it follows the  flatterers, which is a common and especially harmful plague of this  power, against which no one can sufficiently guard and protect himself.  Here it is led by the nose, and oppresses the common people, becomes a  government of the like of which a heathen says: \"The spider-webs catch  the small flies, but the mill-stones roll through.\" So the laws,  ordinances and government of one and the same authority hold the small  men, and the great are free; and where the prince is not himself so  wise that he needs nobody's advice, or has such a standing that they  fear him, there will and must be (unless God should do a special  wonder) a childish government.    For this reason God has considered evil, unfit rulers the greatest of  plagues, as He threatens, Isaiah iii, \"I will take away from them every  man of valor, and will give children to be their princes and babes to  rule over them.\" Four plagues God has named in Scripture, Ezekiel xiv.  The first and slightest, which also David chose, is pestilence, the  second is famine, the third is war, the fourth is all manner of evil  beasts, such as lions, wolves, serpents, dragons; these are the wicked  rulers. For where these are, the land is destroyed, not only in body  and property, as in the others, but also in honor, discipline, virtue  and the soul's salvation. For pestilence and famine make people good  and rich; but war and wicked rulers bring to naught everything that has  to do with temporal and eternal possessions.    XV. A prince must also be very wise and not at all times undertake to  enforce his own will, although he may have the authority and the very  best cause. For it is a far nobler virtue to endure wrong to one's  authority than to risk property and person, if it is advantageous to  the subjects; since worldly rights attach only to temporal goods.    Hence, it is a very foolish saying: I have a right to it, therefore I  will take it by storm and keep it, although all sorts of misfortune may  come to others thereby. So we read of the Emperor Octavianus, that he  did not wish to make war, however just his cause might be, unless there  were sure indications of greater benefit than harm, or at least that  the harm would not be intolerable, and said: \"War is like fishing with  a golden net; the loss risked is always greater than the catch can be.\"  For he who guides a wagon must walk far otherwise than if he were  walking alone; when alone he may walk, jump, and do as he will; but  when he drives, he must so guide and adapt himself that the wagon and  horses can follow him, and regard that more than his own will. So also  a prince leads a multitude with him and must not walk and act as he  wills, but as the multitude can, considering their need and advantage  more than his will and pleasure. For when a prince rules after his own  mad will and follows his own opinion, he is like a mad driver, who  rushes straight ahead with horse and wagon, through bushes, thorns,  ditches, water, up hill and down dale, regardless of roads and bridges;  he will not drive long, all will go to smash.    Therefore it would be most profitable for rulers, that they read, or  have read to them, from youth on, the histories, both in sacred and in  profane books, in which they would find more examples and skill in  ruling than in all the books of law; as we read that the kings of  Persia did, Esther vi. For examples and histories benefit and teach  more than the laws and statutes: there actual experience teaches, here  untried and uncertain words.    XVI. Three special, distinct works all rulers might do in our times,  particularly in our lands. First, to make an end of the horrible  gluttony and drunkenness, not only because of the excess, but also  because of its expense. For through seasonings and spices and the like,  without which men could well live, no little loss of temporal wealth  has come and daily is coming upon our lands. To prevent these two great  evils would truly give the temporal power enough to do, for the inroads  they have made are wide and deep. And how could those in power serve  God better and thereby also improve their own land?    Secondly, to forbid the excessive cost of clothing, whereby so much  wealth is wasted, and yet only the world and the flesh are served; it  is fearful to think that such abuse is to be found among the people who  have been pledged, baptised and consecrated to Christ, the Crucified,  and who should bear the Cross after Him and prepare for the life to  come by dying daily. If some men erred through ignorance, it might be  borne; but that it is practised so freely, without punishment, without  shame, without hindrance, nay, that praise and fame are sought thereby,  this is indeed an unchristian thing. Thirdly, to drive out the usurious  buying of rent-charges, which in the whole world ruins, consumes and  troubles all lands, peoples and cities through its cunning form, by  which it appears not to be usury, while in truth it is worse than  usury, because men are not on their guard against it as against open  usury. See, these are the three Jews, as men say, who suck the whole  world dry. Here princes ought not to sleep, nor be lazy, if they would  give a good account of their office to God.    XVII. Here too ought to be mentioned the knavery which is practised by  officiales and other episcopal and spiritual officers, who ban, load,  hunt and drive the poor people with great burdens, as long as a penny  remains. This ought to be prevented by the temporal sword, since there  is no other help or remedy.    O, would God in heaven, that some time a government might be  established that would do away with the public bawdy-houses, as was  done among the people of Israel! It is indeed an unchristian sight,  that public houses of sin are maintained among Christians, a thing  formerly altogether unheard of. It should be a rule that boys and girls  should be married early and such vice be prevented. Such a rule and  custom ought to be sought for by both the spiritual and the temporal  power. If it was possible among the Jews, why should it not also be  possible among Christians?  Nay, if it is possible in villages, towns  and some cities, as we all see, why should it not be possible  everywhere?    But the trouble is, there is no real government in the world. No one  wants to work, therefore the mechanics must give their workmen holiday:  then they are free and no one can tame them. But if there were a rule  that they must do as they are bid, and no one would give them work in  other places, this evil would to a large extent be mended. God help us!  I fear that here the wish is far greater than the hope; but this does  not excuse us.    Now see, here only a few works of magistrates are indicated, but they  are so good and so many, that they have superabundant good works to do  every hour and could constantly serve God. But these works, like the  others, should also be done in faith, yea, be an exercise of faith, so  that no one expect to please God by the works, but by confident trust  in His favor do such works only to the honor and praise of his gracious  God, thereby to serve and benefit his neighbor.    XVIII. The fourth work of this Commandment is obedience of servants and  workmen toward their lords and ladies, masters and mistresses. Of this  St. Paul says, Titus ii: \"Thou shalt exhort servants that they highly  honor their masters, be obedient, do what pleases them, not cheating  them nor opposing them\"; for this reason also: because they thereby  bring the doctrine of Christ and our faith into good repute, that the  heathen cannot complain of us and be offended. St. Peter also says:  \"Servants, be subject to your masters, for the fear of God, not only to  the good and gentle, but also to the froward and harsh. For this is  acceptable with God, if a man suffers harshness, being innocent.\"    Now there is the greatest complaint in the world about servants and  working men, that they are disobedient, unfaithful, unmannerly, and  over-reaching; this is a plague sent of God. And truly, this is the one  work of servants whereby they may be saved; truly they need not make  pilgrimages or do this thing or the other; they have enough to do if  their heart is only set on this, that they gladly do and leave undone  what they know pleases their masters and mistresses, and all this in a  simple faith; not that they would by their works gain much merit, but  that they do it all in the confidence of divine favor (in which all  merits are to be found), purely for nothing, out of the love and  good-will toward God which grows out of such confidence. And all such  works they should think of as an exercise and exhortation ever to  strengthen their faith and confidence more and more. For, as has now  been frequently said, this faith makes all works good, yea, it must do  them and be the master-workman.    XIX. On the other hand, the masters and mistresses should not rule  their servants, maids and workingmen roughly, not look to all things  too closely, occasionally overlook something, and for peace' sake make  allowances. For it is not possible that everything be done perfectly at  all times among any class of men, as long as we live on earth in  imperfection. Of this St. Paul says, Colossians iv, \"Masters, do unto  your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that ye also have a  Master in heaven.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#19)"],[1,", or take root, an' neither did the glass  feet of the Glass Cat.  It's only a thing that's made of meat--like man  an' beasts--that the magic can hold an' root to the ground.  Our shoes  are leather, an' leather comes from a beast's hide.  Our stockin's are  wool, an' wool comes from a sheep's back.  So, when we walked on the  Magic Isle, our feet took root there an' held us fast.  But not my  wooden leg.  So now I'll put a wooden bottom on my other foot an' the  magic can't stop me.\"    \"But why do you wish to go back to the island?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Didn't you see the Magic Flower in the gold flower-pot?\" returned  Cap'n Bill.    \"Of course I saw it, and it's lovely and wonderful.\"    \"Well, Trot an' I set out to get the magic plant for a present to Ozma  on her birthday, and I mean to get it an' take it back with us to the  Emerald City.\"    \"That would be fine,\" cried Trot eagerly, \"if you think you can do it,  and it would be safe to try!\"    \"I'm pretty sure it is safe, the way I've fixed my foot,\" said the  sailor, \"an' if I SHOULD happen to get caught, I s'pose the Wizard  could save me again.\"    \"I suppose I could,\" agreed the Wizard.  \"Anyhow, if you wish to try  it, Cap'n Bill, go ahead and we'll stand by and watch what happens.\"    So the sailor-man got upon the raft again and paddled over to the Magic  Isle, landing as close to the golden flower-pot as he could.  They  watched him walk across the land, put both arms around the flower-pot  and lift it easily from its place.  Then he carried it to the raft and  set it down very gently.  The removal did not seem to affect the Magic  Flower in any way, for it was growing daffodils when Cap'n Bill picked  it up and on the way to the raft it grew tulips and gladioli.  During  the time the sailor was paddling across the river to where his friends  awaited him, seven different varieties of flowers bloomed in succession  on the plant.    \"I guess the Magician who put it on the island never thought that any  one would carry it off,\" said Dorothy.    \"He figured that only men would want the plant, and any man who went  upon the island to get it would be caught by the enchantment,\" added  the Wizard.    \"After this,\" remarked Trot, \"no one will care to go on the island, so  it won't be a trap any more.\"    \"There,\" exclaimed Cap'n Bill, setting down the Magic Plant in triumph  upon the river bank, \"if Ozma gets a better birthday present than that,  I'd like to know what it can be!\"    \"It'll s'prise her, all right,\" declared Dorothy, standing in awed  wonder before the gorgeous blossoms and watching them change from  yellow roses to violets.    \"It'll s'prise ev'rybody in the Em'rald City,\" Trot asserted in glee,  \"and it'll be Ozma's present from Cap'n Bill and me.\"    \"I think I ought to have a little credit,\" objected the Glass Cat.  \"I  discovered the thing, and led you to it, and brought the Wizard here to  save you when you got caught.\"    \"That's true,\" admitted Trot, \"and I'll tell Ozma the whole story, so  she'll know how good you've been.\"          20.  The Monkeys Have Trouble      \"Now,\" said the Wizard, \"we must start for home.  But how are we going  to carry that big gold flower-pot?  Cap'n Bill can't lug it all the  way, that's certain.\"    \"No,\" acknowledged the sailor-man; \"it's pretty heavy.  I could carry  it for a little while, but I'd have to stop to rest every few minutes.\"    \"Couldn't we put it on your back?\" Dorothy asked the Cowardly Lion,  with a good-natured yawn.    \"I don't object to carrying it, if you can fasten it on,\" answered the  Lion.    \"If it falls off,\" said Trot, \"it might get smashed an' be ruined.\"    \"I'll fix it,\" promised Cap'n Bill.  \"I'll make a flat board out of one  of these tree trunks, an' tie the board on the lion's back, an' set the  flower-pot on the board.\"  He set to work at once to do this, but as he  only had his big knife for a tool his progress was slow.    So the Wizard took from his black bag a tiny saw that shone like silver  and said to it:      \"Saw, Little Saw, come show your power;    Make us a board for the Magic Flower.\"      And at once the Little Saw began to move and it sawed the log so fast  that those who watched it work were astonished.  It seemed to  understand, too, just what the board was to be used for, for when it  was completed it was flat on top and hollowed beneath in such a manner  that it exactly fitted the Lion's back.    \"That beats whittlin'!\" exclaimed Cap'n Bill, admiringly.  \"You don't  happen to have TWO o' them saws; do you, Wizard?\"    \"No,\" replied the Wizard, wiping the Magic Saw carefully with his silk  handkerchief and putting it back in the black bag.  \"It's the only saw  of its kind in the world; and if there were more like it, it wouldn't  be so wonderful.\"    They now tied the board on the Lion's back, flat side up, and Cap'n  Bill carefully placed the Magic Flower on the board.    \"For fear o' accidents,\" he said, \"I'll walk beside the Lion and hold  onto the flower-pot.\"    Trot and Dorothy could both ride on the back of the Hungry Tiger, and  between them they carried the cage of monkeys.  But this arrangement  left the Wizard, as well as the sailor, to make the journey on foot,  and so the procession moved slowly and the Glass Cat grumbled because  it would take so long to get to the Emerald City.    The Cat was sour-tempered and grumpy, at first, but before they had  journeyed far, the crystal creature had discovered a fine amusement.  The long tails of the monkeys were constantly sticking through the bars  of their cage, and when they did, the Glass Cat would slyly seize the  tails in her paws and pull them.  That made the monkeys scream, and  their screams pleased the Glass Cat immensely.  Trot and Dorothy tried  to stop this naughty amusement, but when they were not looking the Cat  would pull the tails again, and the creature was so sly and quick that  the monkeys could seldom escape.  They scolded the Cat angrily and  shook the bars of their cage, but they could not get out and the Cat  only laughed at them.    After the party had left the forest and were on the plains of the  Munchkin Country, it grew dark, and they were obliged to make camp for  the night, choosing a pretty place beside a brook.  By means of his  magic the Wizard created three tents, pitched in a row on the grass and  nicely fitted with all that was needful for the comfort of his  comrades.  The middle tent was for Dorothy and Trot, and had in it two  cosy white beds and two chairs.  Another tent, also with beds and  chairs, was for the Wizard and Cap'n Bill, while the third tent was for  the Hungry Tiger, the Cowardly Lion, the cage of Monkeys and the Glass  Cat.  Outside the tents the Wizard made a fire and placed over it a  magic kettle from which he presently drew all sorts of nice things for  their supper, smoking hot.    After they had eaten and talked together for a while under the  twinkling stars, they all went to bed and the people were soon asleep.  The Lion and the Tiger had almost fallen asleep, too, when they were  roused by the screams of the monkeys, for the Glass Cat was pulling  their tails again.  Annoyed by the uproar, the Hungry Tiger cried:  \"Stop that racket!\" and getting sight of the Glass Cat, he raised his  big paw and struck at the creature.  The cat was quick enough to dodge  the blow, but the claws of the Hungry Tiger scraped the monkey's cage  and bent two of the bars.    Then the Tiger lay down again to sleep, but the monkeys soon discovered  that the bending of the bars would allow them to squeeze through.  They  did not leave the cage, however, but after whispering together they let  their tails stick out and all remained quiet.  Presently the Glass Cat  stole near the cage again and gave a yank to one of the tails.  Instantly the monkeys leaped through the bars, one after another, and  although they were so small the entire dozen of them surrounded the  Glass Cat and clung to her claws and tail and ears and made her a  prisoner.  Then they forced her out of the tent and down to the banks  of the stream.  The monkeys had noticed that these banks were covered  with thick, slimy mud of a dark blue color, and when they had taken the  Cat to the stream, they smeared this mud all over the glass body of the  cat, filling the creature's ears and eyes with it, so that she could  neither see nor hear.  She was no longer transparent and so thick was  the mud upon her that no one could see her pink brains or her ruby  heart.    In this condition they led the pussy back to the tent and then got  inside their cage again.    By morning the mud had dried hard on the Glass Cat and it was a dull  blue color throughout.  Dorothy and Trot were horrified, but the Wizard  shook his head and said it served the Glass Cat right for teasing the  monkeys.    Cap'n Bill, with his strong hands, soon bent the golden wires of the  monkeys' cage into the proper position and then he asked the Wizard if  he should wash the Glass Cat in the water of the brook.    \"Not just yet,\" answered the Wizard.  \"The Cat deserves to be punished,  so I think I'll leave that blue mud--which is as bad as paint--upon her  body until she gets to the Emerald City.  The silly creature is so vain  that she will be greatly shamed when the Oz people see her in this  condition, and perhaps she'll take the lesson to heart and leave the  monkeys alone hereafter.\"    However, the Glass Cat could not see or hear, and to avoid carrying her  on the journey the Wizard picked the mud out of her eyes and ears and  Dorothy dampened her handkerchief and washed both the eyes and ears  clean.    As soon as she could speak the Glass Cat asked indignantly: \"Aren't you  going to punish those monkeys for playing such a trick on me?\"    \"No,\" answered the Wizard.  \"You played a trick on them by pulling  their tails, so this is only tit-for-tat, and I'm glad the monkeys had  their revenge.\"    He wouldn't allow the"]]]
