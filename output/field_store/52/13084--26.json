[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#19)"],[1," Forty-five ducks will pack in a sugar barrel and 33 in a flour  barrel. The proper number for the barrel used is placed on hanging  spring scales and weighed before being packed. The best method of  packing is to lay the ducks on their sides. If they are packed on their  backs or bellies, the ice used between the layers is apt to cause a  cutting or bruising of the soft abdomens and injure the appearance of  the carcasses. Between each layer of ducks a scoopful of cracked ice is  used although in cool weather it may only be necessary to use half a  scoop of ice. After the barrel is packed it should be allowed to stand  for a while to settle. Then the top of the barrel is piled up with  cracked ice and covered with burlap. On the side of the barrel is marked  the number of ducks and their weight. Later a card is tacked alongside  of this showing the consignee's and the shipper's names as well as the  number of ducks and their weight.    [Illustration: FIG. 47. Dressed duckling.

After thorough cooling a sufficient number of  ducks to fill a barrel is weighed out and packed with or without ice  depending upon the weather. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal  Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Shipping._ The barrels should be packed and shipped the same evening.  Shipping may be done either by express or by automobile truck. A good  many of the Long Island ducklings are now shipped into New York City by  truck.    _Cooperative Marketing Association._ The duck growers on Long Island  have formed a cooperative marketing association. This association  maintains its own house in New York City and sells practically the  entire output of Long Island ducklings, controlling probably 90%. During  the year 1919 there were in the neighborhood of 800,000 head of ducks  marketed through this house. Practically all of the capital stock of  this concern is held by the duck growers and they are not allowed to  sell any of their stock without first offering it to the association.    _Prices for Ducks._ Early in the season the ducklings bring the best  prices, that is to say from March 1 to May 1. Then as the output of  ducks increases prices gradually drop. The heaviest shipments occur in  June, July and August. In September as the output of ducks begins to  drop off the price begins to climb a little. The following prices as  quoted in the New York Produce Review show the range from March, 1920,  to June, 1921.      Long Island Ducklings--Fresh Dressed      1920    March 31            45c per lb.

This is particularly true  during the Jewish holidays in March and in September and October when  the demand for live ducks and the price paid for them is excellent. As a  rule it pays better to ship alive the ducks which are inclined to be a  little thin rather than to ship those which are in top market condition.  This is due to the fact that fat ducks will shrink very considerably  when cooped and shipped alive, this shrinkage running from one-half to  three-quarters of a pound per head where they are cooped not to exceed  12 to 15 hours. The ducks which are in the fattest condition will shrink  the most. At the season of the year when live ducks are in best demand  it often pays to ship alive the ducklings which are sorted out as not  being in the best condition rather than to hold them for further  fattening.    _Saving the Feathers._ The feathers from the ducks form quite an  important source of revenue to the duck farmers. As stated before the  value of the feathers will a little more than pay for the cost of  picking and since this is a considerable item of expense the grower  cannot afford to neglect the feathers. The soft body feathers are kept  separate from the coarser feathers, the latter being thrown on the floor  as they are plucked. These coarser feathers are later swept up and are  commonly spoken of as sweepings. Feathers from dry-picked ducks are  superior in quality and bring a better price but most of the duck  feathers now marketed from commercial duck farms are scalded feathers.  The feathers after each day's killing are gathered up and spread out in  a loft where they can be placed in a layer not over 3 or 4 inches deep.  This should be an airy place so as to give the feathers a good place to  dry out. On the second day they are scraped up in a pile and then spread  out again, thus turning them over and changing their position. They are  then left until they are dry enough to sack which should be in a little  over a week. Unless the feathers are thoroughly dried out they will heat  when sacked and this will seriously hurt their market quality. When dry  they are packed either in the large special feather sacks made for this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33044"],[0,"Birds from North Borneo (#19)"],[1," 5 x  5 mm., November 17, 1962, MCT 3298; [Female], November 17, 1962, MCT  3299. 5.5 mi.

This was the most common of all the spiderhunters, and was found at       all localities. It was readily taken in mist nets. Unlike most       birds, these spiderhunters become quite agitated in nets, and       within a few minutes usually strangle themselves.         From October 16 through November 11, I took several specimens 12       miles north of Kalabakan, but only one in breeding condition. On       November 15, I moved 12 miles back to Kalabakan from an elevation       of 600 feet to an elevation of 50 feet. As can be seen from the       specimen-data, nearly all the females then collected either had       nests with eggs or were approaching oviposition. The specimens were       all taken in nets in an area approximately 200 feet square. On       November 20 at the Brantian Estate a bird sitting on a branch six       inches up in secondary forest jumped down to the ground and fed on       unknown material.    _=Arachnothera crassirostris=_ (Reichenbach): Thick-billed  Spiderhunter.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 14.8  gm., August 9, 1962, MCT 2746.         This spiderhunter was recorded on the basis of one specimen and one       sight record. One seen in secondary forest would dart out from its       perch on a limb, hover near the end of a branch, and then return to       its perch. No flowers were visible and I assumed that the bird was       catching insects.    _=Arachnothera flavigaster=_ (Eyton): Greater Yellow-eared  Spiderhunter.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] imm.,  36.3 gm., August 21, 1962, MCT 2789; [Female] imm., 38.4 gm., August 21,  1962, MCT 2790; [Female], 38.4 gm., August 22, 1962, MCT 2795; [Female]  brood patch, largest ova 2 mm., November 27, 1962, MCT 3330; [Male],  November 28, 1962, MCT 3359; [Male] testis 7 x 6 mm., November 29, 1962,  MCT 3379; [Male], November 30, 1962, MCT 3395; [Female], April 27, 1963,  ADG 66; [Female], April 27, 1963, ADG 67.         This species was met with only at Quoin Hill, where it was common       around the abaca and wild bananas. The primary diet seemed to be       pollen, nectar, and spiders. I found it easy to differentiate from       the next species in the field (see below).    _=Arachnothera chrysogenys harrissoni=_ Deignan: Lesser Yellow-eared  Spiderhunter.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 23.5  gm., August 21, 1962, MCT 2788; [Male], April 27, 1963, ADG 68; [Male],  April 30, 1963, ADG 92; [Male], May 27, 1963, ADG 113.         I observed this species at Quoin Hill only once, but Garcia took       three specimens at the same locality. He labels his specimens as       taken in primary forest. I never saw the species there and took my       one specimen in the abaca, where the bird was eating spiders,       nectar, and pollen. The chief characters distinguishing this       species from _A. flavigaster_ were the tuft of yellow feathers on       the side of the head and the narrow eye ring in _A. chrysogenys_.    _=Arachnothera affinis pars=_ Riley: Gray-breasted  Spiderhunter.--_Specimens_, 27: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 27.2  gm., August 13, 1962, MCT 2771; [Female], 22.2 gm., August 13, 1962, MCT  2772; [Female] imm., 21.1 gm., August 13, 1962, MCT 2773; [Male], 29.2  gm., August 13, 1962, MCT 2774; [Male], 27.0 gm., August 21, 1962, MCT  2791; [Male], 26.6 gm., August 21, 1962, MCT 2792; [Male], April 27,  1963, ADG 65; [Female] imm., May 1, 1963, ADG 99; [Male], June 12, 1963,  ADG 126; [Male], June 20, 1963, ADG 154-B. 12 mi.

This bird was fairly common at Quoin Hill in the abaca and wild       bananas and, at Kalabakan, in primary forest. Its feeding habits       are the same as those of the preceding species. The order of       abundance of the spiderhunters is probably best shown by the number       of each species taken: _Arachnothera longirostris_, 58; _A.       affinis_, 27; _A. flavigaster_, 9; _A. chrysogenys_, 4; _A.       crassirostris_, 1.    _=Prionichilus xanthopygius=_ (Salvadori): Yellow-rumped  Flowerpecker.--_Specimens_, 7: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 5 x  5 mm., 8.9 gm., August 23, 1962, MCT 2800; [Female] largest ova 3 mm.,  oviduct enlarged, 10.2 gm., September 13, 1962, MCT 2910; [Female] imm.,  9.7 gm., September 13, 1962, MCT 2911; [Male] testis 3 x 2 mm., 9.5 gm.,  September 13, 1962, MCT 2912; [Female] imm., 7.0 gm., September 14,  1962, MCT 2920; [Male] testis 6 x 4 mm., vas deferens enlarged,  September 26, 1962, MCT 2966; [Male], November 27, 1962, MCT 3344.         This species did not appear at Quoin Hill until August 23. The       gonads of most of the adults taken from that time on appeared to be       regressing from breeding condition, and several immatures were       taken also, suggesting that the breeding season was over. The birds       seemed to be attracted, with bulbuls, to the tree _Trema       orientalis_.    _=Prionichilus maculatus maculatus=_ (Temminck): Yellow-throated  Flowerpecker.--_Specimen_, 1: 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], October 19,  1962, MCT 3094.         I observed this flowerpecker once at Quoin Hill, in much-disturbed       primary forest, but was unable to secure a specimen. Twelve miles       north of Kalabakan it was found in primary forest.    _=Dicaeum chrysorrheum=_ Temminck: Yellow-vented Flowerpecker.--I  observed one feeding about 50 feet high among epiphytic plants in the  moss forest 5.5 miles north of Tenom.    _=Dicaeum monticolum=_ Sharpe: Black-sided Flowerpecker.--_Specimen_, 1:  5.5 mi.

This flowerpecker was found only in the moss forest above Tenom,       where it was seen numerous times feeding among the epiphytic       plants.    _=Zosterops everetti tahanensis=_ Ogilvie-Grant: Everett's  White-eye.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], August 8,  1962, MCT 2734; [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., August 8, 1962, MCT 2735;  [Female], 8.6 gm., August 11, 1962, MCT 2757; [Female], 7.8 gm., August  11, 1962, MCT 2758; [Female] imm., 7.9 gm., August 11, 1962, MCT 2759;  [Female], 8.2 gm., August 11, 1962, MCT 2760; [Male], 7.8 gm., August  11, 1962, MCT 2761; [Male] imm., August 11, 1962, MCT 2762; [Male] imm.,  7.8 gm., August 11, 1962, MCT 2764.         At the Cocoa Research Station flocks of 20 to 40 birds were seen       daily, feeding in the cocoa trees. Only once was this species seen       away from the cocoa trees; this was in secondary forest where the       birds were feeding in a tree about 30 feet tall. They move in       flocks and are noisy.         Smythies (1960:485) states that this species occurs from the Poi       Range up to the lower slopes of Kinabalu. This is apparently the       first record from eastern Borneo.    _=Lonchura fuscans=_ (Cassin): Dusky Munia.--_Specimens_, 11. Cocoa  Research Station: [Female], July 6, 1962, MCT 2603; [Female], September  1, 1962, MCT 2847; [Male] testis 7 x 6 mm., September 1, 1962, MCT 2848;  [Male] testis enlarged, September 24, 1962, MCT 2943. Tenom: [Female],  January 6, 1962, MCT 3584; [Female], January 6, 1963, MCT 3585; [Male]  testis enlarged, January 6, 1963, MCT 3586; [Female] several collapsed  follicles, old brood patch, January 6, 1963, MCT 3587; [Female] imm.,  January 6, 1963, MCT 3588; [Female], January 6, 1963, MCT 3590; [Male]  testis enlarged, January 6, 1963, MCT 3591.         In contrast to _L. malacca_, this species was commonly found in       secondary forest away from cultivated fields. It was common at       Quoin Hill and Kalabakan. On July 18, 1962, a pair was observed       building a nest near Kalabakan, in a native kampong under the eave       of a house. There the birds were fastening the nest to the palm       thatching about 20 feet up and nearly over the door. Another pair       was nesting, close to the same house, about eight feet up in a       citrus tree. In Kalabakan proper, I saw a pair with fledgling young       in a croton bush about six feet from the door of a house, on       November 15, 1962. This nest was about seven feet up.    _=Lonchura malacca=_ (Linnaeus): Chestnut Munia.--_Specimens_, 6:  Tawau: [Female] imm., September 2, 1962, MCT 2862. Tenom: [Male],  January 6, 1963, MCT 3589. Tuaran: [Female], January 12, 1963, MCT 3594;  [Female], January 12, 1963, MCT 3595; hermaphrodite, testis 8 x 5 mm.,  largest ovum of ovary 2 mm., January 12, 1963, MCT 3596; [Female],  January 12, 1963, MCT"]]]
