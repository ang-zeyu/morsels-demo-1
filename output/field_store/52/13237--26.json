God required it of them, and even ordered them into an unpromising  wilderness, to be subject to hunger, and thirst, and many hardships.    The same spirit of opposition to miracles, prophets, and angels exists  now; and the righteous can no more keep the ordinances and commandments  of God now, without persecution even to death from the world, than the  Hebrews could do it. For the same reason Lot _gathered_ out of Sodom  --even angels could not stop a night in Sodom without being mobbed;  accordingly, the Lord commanded him to gather up so many as would  go with him and flee to the mountain. His reason for the gathering  in this case was, that He could not properly punish the Sodomites,  unless the righteous were gathered out of the city in the first place.  Likewise, when Jerusalem was about to be destroyed, Jesus instructed  his disciples to flee to the mountain.    It was persecution that scattered the primitive Saints abroad in the  days of Jesus. Jesus had taught Paul and Peter, that the Saints could  not be preserved on the earth, and the kingdom built up, without the  Saints were gathered together in one. He told them, absolutely and  unequivocally, that he should gather the disciples in the day of  restitution. Such was their sense of the immediateness of gathering,  and of the second coming of Christ, that they were troubled when the  disciples were _gathered_, lest the day of the Lord was at hand; but  Paul disabused them, and told them that there must be a \"falling away\"  before the notable day of the Lord should come.    Paul informed his brethren, that in the dispensation of the fulness of  times, God would gather together in one, all things both in heaven and  upon earth and under the earth. John speaks of the same, probably as  the day of the great battle of God Almighty, Jesus signified that He  would gather his people, the elect, even if he had to send his angels  to the four corners of the earth to bring them, after the manner in  which he sent to Sodom to bring Lot out of it to a place of safety. He  declared he would gather the wheat into the garner, and the tares into  bundles to be burned. The prophets, too, long before the meridian of  time, saw with enrapturing vision, the sons coming from afar, and the  daughters from the ends of the earth.    Isaiah says, \"the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the  brightness of thy rising. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see,  all they _gather_ themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons  shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.  Then shalt thou see and flow together, and thine heart shall fear and  be enlarged, because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto  thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. Who are these  that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? Surely the  isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy  sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name  of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel. And the sons of  strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto  thee, that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles. And he  shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts  of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the corners  of the earth.\"    The gathering of Saints to one place is necessary in order to preserve  their genealogies, and to secure to them those inheritances, the title  to which must be substantiated by legitimate records, kept in the  archives of the house of God. Whenever God has had a people. He has  been careful to instruct them to keep an accurate record of marriages  and the issues of marriage; from Adam to Noah, and from Noah to  Abraham, and thence to David down to Jesus Christ, the genealogy must  necessarily be preserved. Says David, \"God setteth people in families  as a flock.\" \"He arrangeth them in families.\" But if these families  intermarry with those who do not keep the laws of God, nor conform to  his ordinances, the records of genealogy are soon obliterated from the  knowledge of men, and the proof of a legitimate title to inheritance is  thereby extinct; and unless Saints are gathered out from the midst of  unbelievers, they are more liable to intermarry and become alienated  from the ordinances and covenants of the Lord. If Isaac and Ishmael  have no records of parentage, how can one claim rights of lineage above  another? God will assign rewards to men according to the _records_ of  their deserts, and one great pre-requisite to the final restitution  of all things, is the reviving and establishing of proper records of  genealogy, and covenants, and promises, and patriarchal blessings.    In one instance God had to rescind the marriages of a numerous people,  because such marriages, by their issue, would tend to frustrate the  grace of God to the righteous, and entail blessings upon a strange  people that God designed to curse. The ordinances of the church and  institutions of God's house cannot be carried into execution in a land  belonging to \"aliens from the commonwealth of Israel;\" because aliens  from God will not have the Lord to rule over them. They consider that  the laws of God set two against three, and three against two, the  father-in-law against the son-in-law, &c.; and so do they have this  effect, and always will have it, until the Saints are separated from  their adversaries. Before there can be anything like a true, godlike,  peaceful millennium, a separation must take place between the righteous  and disobedient; even as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats,  even so must God's will be done with friends and foes on earth, like as  in heaven.    Had the Jews received Jesus Christ, He would have set up just such a  kingdom on earth as in heaven, and the honest from all nations would  have been _gathered_ to his standard. But seeing they would pierce the  Shepherd, and scatter the sheep through a long cloudy day, as it had  been prophesied of Him and his followers; He, nevertheless, assured his  disciples that his people should be _gathered_, in the latter days, as  wheat into the garner. John says to the Saints in the last days, that  are scattered among the confused nations of the whole earth:--\"_Come  out of her my people, and be not partakers of her sins, that ye receive  not of her plagues_.\" Here the reason why Saints should come out of  other nations is distinctly avowed--\"to escape her plagues.\" The same  reason that was assigned why Lot should go out of Sodom.    The idea prevalent that God would inflict all his judgments in one  great tremendous DAY, is as absurd as the notion is universal. The  famine and dearth were at the command of Elijah. The earthquake that  swallowed up Dathan and the company of Abiram, was at the command of  Moses. Moses also stretched out his hand as a signal to the accumulated  seas to overwhelm the Egyptians, and they obeyed his mandate. But I  will not multiply proofs. God will pour out his vials of wrath, and  distress the nations till they will learn and practice righteousness;  and his people must flee to their appointed hiding place till the  indignation is overpast, otherwise they have no guaranty for their  safety. The Hebrews were obliged to mark their houses, lest the  destroying angel should slay both them and the Egyptians. The Lord  God has decreed a consumption upon the whole earth, therefore let the  righteous flee to the strongholds of Zion, that are preparing in that  land that was promised to the Patriarch Joseph, while it is an accepted  time, and the evil days come not.    Jesus cautioned Jerusalem saints to beware of imitating the silly and  dilatory part of Lot's wife. The righteous are no more secure from  approaching judgments than the wicked, except they obey the commands  of God. Even a prophet was once slain by a lion, because he dared to  disobey the Lord. No man should neglect any means by which he can be  removed, and help to remove others, from those nations that are as  inevitably doomed to destruction for rebellion, as the Canaanites of  former times.    Sir, we feel the very same extraordinary interest in depositing our  very bones in the land of Zion, that the patriarchs formerly felt when  they commanded that their bones should be removed, to the country and  burying place which God had designated. If there is enthusiasm in this  sentiment, sir, it is the enthusiasm of patriarchs and prophets that  kept the divine mandates, and knew well the order of the resurrection,  and the necessity of having their bones laid on the identical land that  should afterwards be their possession and inheritance for ever and  ever. Did not the Lord apportion off the land of Canaan to the twelve  tribes to be their inheritance for ever? and shall not the one hundred  and forty-four thousand in the latter days be equally tenacious to  possess the very inheritance that was promised them to be a perpetual  possession in time and eternity? There, their bones, like the precious  valley of dry bones, will be the guardian care of angels, and in the  resurrection stand up like a consolidated army, while the disobedient  and ungodly shall be scattered and driven as chaff before the wind.    The aged and infirm among us, fervently desire to carry their bones,  while animated with life, to the land of Zion, as an expression of  their faith in the promise of God, that he will resurrect them and  plant them in that same \"heavenly\" country which they now seek. What  Canaan was to ancient saints and prophets, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#19)"],[1,"worship, the ordinary accompaniments of a  Christian church, dwelling, as at Rome and Syracuse, within the temples  of a creed, fallen indeed but perfectly familiar. But here we see them  within walls reared in honour of we know not what--gods of unchronicled  days, gods alongside of whom Jupiter of the Capitol may have seemed  as strange and foreign as Mithras and Serapis now seem alongside of  Jupiter of the Capitol.    Where the praehistoric temple has thus become the cathedral church, it  is not out of keeping that the wall of the praehistoric _arx_ should  become the wall of the cathedral close. This is the wall which we see  from afar, a wall which seems so straight and regular, so clearly  furnished with a modern finish at top, that it is not till we can  distinguish the mighty blocks of which it is formed that it has the air  of a wall even of Roman, even of mediaeval, antiquity. Shall we say it?  As we looked up at no very amazing distance, the wall of the _arx_ of  Alatri had a good deal of the air of the wall of a modern prison. We  could not yet see the construction, and the outline seemed more regular  and rectangular than it proves to be. Nowhere do we better see than  at Alatri the nature of these primitive walls. They are seldom walls  in the same sense as the later walls of Rome or of other places, walls  built on the ground and standing up clear on both sides. Their business  commonly is, as is perhaps more clear at Alatri than anywhere else,  to strengthen by masonry the scarped side of a hill. Hence they have  little or no height within, and the gateways are necessarily reached  from within by a steep descent. The open space at Alatri allows this  arrangement to be studied with unusual ease. The wall is eminently a  wall against a hill, and its arrangements are made with no small art.  The weak corner has its double defence; the way up from the town at  this point is carefully sheltered. And what stones they are with which  the hill of Alatri is strengthened; above all, what stones they are  which are piled together to form its main gateway. Nowhere indeed in  the walls of Alatri, whether of temple, _arx_, or city, do we find  anything quite so rude as the rudest part of the wall of Cori. All the  stones, of whatever shape--and they are of many shapes--have clearly  been cut; they are all laid according to some kind of system, though  the system according to which they are laid is not the same in every  part of the wall. In some parts they seem almost to take the shape of  constructive arches, at least of attempts at arches, such as may be  seen in gateways and roofs at Segni and elsewhere. The true arch, it  is hardly needful to say, is nowhere found in the original work; nor  do we find even any of the attempts at the arch in that position where  we should have most naturally looked for them, in the gateways. The  great gateway of the _arx_ at Alatri is indeed a wonderful work. Its  builders either knew the arch and despised it, or else the thought of  the arch had not come into their heads. It is as pure an example of  the lintel-construction as any gateway at Athens or Mykene. We suppose  that the lintel-stone of the great treasury is yet vaster than the huge  lintel-stone at Alatri; but the Anakim of Alatri were at least rivals  whom those of Mykene could not have despised. But, except in vastness  of construction, we must not compare the gateway at Alatri, perfectly  plain, a mere piling, though a very skilful piling, of huge blocks with  the really artistic work of the Mykenaian treasuries. It goes rather  with the lion-gate; only there are no lions. The builders of Alatri  could carve, as is shown over one of the smaller gateways of the _arx_.  But they chose to carve quite other subjects than lions. On the great  gate however they carved nothing; that is left in the stern majesty of  the vast blocks which form it. And here we may distinguish between the  cut blocks of the gateway itself and the far ruder blocks just within  it, which merely formed part of the foundation, and which, when the  steep path went down to the gate, would not have stood above ground.  Even the builders of primaeval walls clearly drew a line between what  was meant to meet the public eye and what was not.    But we must remember that the walls of which we have been speaking,  the walls which first catch the eye, are not the whole of the walls of  Alatri. They fence in only its inner and higher circuit. Their effect  in the distant view is so imposing that the visitor will most likely be  tempted to go to them first, instead of doing things in a more regular  order by first tracking out the walls of the town itself. But these  last, except that they do not supply anything like the primaeval gate,  are just as well worthy of study as the walls of the _arx_ itself. They  remain perfectly round the greater part of the circuit of the city, and  they are of the same general construction as the walls of the _arx_.  At some points a singular contrast is made by mediaeval additions to  the defences; good thirteenth century work, with the characteristic  windows of the time, stands out as projections from the primaeval wall.  And, as in some of the other places, we have something thrown in in  the way of what the walls contain, besides the attractions of the  walls themselves. From the _arx_ of Alatri we look down on several  bell-towers and rose-windows, and one church at least, that of _Santa  Maria Maggiore_, though hardly equal to its namesake at Ferentino, is  quite worthy of examination. But, next to its walls, the strong point  of Alatri lies in its domestic buildings. Very seldom, in Italy or  out of it, do we see graceful windows, chiefly couplets with a divided  shaft, more thickly gathered together, than in its crooked and narrow  streets. Alatri, in short, is, to the antiquarian eye, satisfactory  in every point save one. There should have been some decent building,  pagan or Christian, crowning the noble site of its _arx_, the noblest  in our whole range.    With Alatri we end one main stage of our _iter_, that of the  hill-cities. We shall henceforth pass by places which lie more in  the world, some of them in the thick of modern communication. But if  we had turned back at Alatri, we should have done a good stroke of  work. A journey to the walls of the Hernicans is in every way pleasant  and profitable. And in truth, even if we throw in the Old-Latins and  the Volscians, it is not a journey of hardships. The little inns  are very humble, very simple, but they may be fed in and slept in  without anything very frightful to endure. It may perhaps be well to  mention that the _Locanda d'Italia_, at Anagni, recommended in various  guide-books, has ceased to exist for some years. Still a day and a  night at Anagni are no hardship, and a guide may be found, shirtless  and letterless, who knows what is really worth going to much better  than many in England who boast at once more clothes and more learning.  Indeed, the men of the walls seem altogether a kindly and well-disposed  race. Some say that is because they are said to be reclaimed brigands,  perhaps on the principle that a reformed rake used to be said to make  the best husband. There are indeed more beggars among them than need  be; but on this head a wise rule was laid down by a young Volscian, or  he might be a Hernican--we cannot always be exact among these obsolete  nationalities--\"Give to the halt and the blind; but not to anybody  else.\"          IV. From Alatri to Capua.      We have done for a while with the hill-cities, though it would not  be hard to find several other spots of the same kind, rivalling  in historical interest, and, by all accounts, rivalling also as to  existing remains, any of those which we have gone through. But the  special necessities of an _iter ad Brundisium_ carry us to quite other  parts of the Italian peninsula, to parts where the sources of interest  are fully equal to those of Etruscan or Latin cities, but where they  are wholly different in kind. We leave the hills, or touch only their  lowest slopes. For a while the mountains still soar above us, while our  work is in the plains. Presently we lose the mountains even as distant  companions; but before long we have the blue waves of Hadria as their  substitute. At last we reach our goal; we go for a season even beyond  it. And when we have gone as far as the devices of modern science can  carry us, when we have reached the very end of the general railway  system of Central Europe, our landscape again takes in both the sea  and the mountains. But the eye now ranges beyond the bounds of Italy,  beyond the bounds of Western Europe. We see across the narrowed waters  to the heights of another peninsula. Without seeking for more than a  chance likeness between the names--a name that ranges from the Euxine to  the Hudson--without seeking in any sort to identify the [Greek: Albanoi]  of Dionysios and the [Greek: Albanoi] of imperial Anna, it is still with  a curious feeling of coincidence that the eyes which not many days before  were looking up to the mount of Alba, now look across the sea to the  wilder mountains of Albania.    Some of those who now looked across had already learned something of  those heights from earlier and nearer experiences. Still it is a new  feeling to look out on them from Italian ground, above all to look  out on them from the spot where the Turk made his entrance into the  western world, and where the signs of his short presence have stamped  themselves deep on local memory. Standing at Otranto, looking on the  Albanian heights, the foremost thought is how near Otranto came to  being to the West of Europe all that the Thracian Kallipolis was to  the East. But we are as yet far from Otranto, far from the heel of the  boot, far even from any point of the Hadriatic coast. We are still on  the western side of the great backbone of Italy;"]]]
