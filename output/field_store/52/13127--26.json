He saw  him ascend and descend through the air with so much grace and agility,  that, if his indignation would have suffered him, he certainly would  have laughed outright. But they suspended neither their laughter nor  their labour; nor did the flying Sancho cease to pour forth  lamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties; yet all  were of no avail, and they desisted at last only from pure fatigue.  They then brought him his ass, and, wrapping him in his cloak, mounted  him thereon. The compassionate maid of the inn, seeing him so  exhausted, bethought of helping him to a jug of water, and that it  might be the cooler, she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it, and  instantly began to drink; but at the first sip, finding it was water,  he would proceed no further, and besought Maritornes to bring him some  wine, which she did willingly, and paid for it with her own money; for  it is indeed said of her that, although in that station, she had some  faint traces of a Christian. When Sancho had ceased drinking, he  clapped heels to his ass; and, the inn-gate being thrown wide open,  out he went, satisfied that he had paid nothing, and had carried his  point, though at the expense of his usual pledge, namely, his back.  The landlord, it is true, retained his wallets in payment of what was  due to him; but Sancho never missed them in the hurry of his  departure. The innkeeper would have fastened the door well after him,  as soon as he saw him out; but the blanketeers would not let him,  being persons of that sort that, though Don Quixote had really been  one of the knights of the round table, they would not have cared two  farthings for him.    Sancho came up to his master so faint and dispirited that he was not  able to urge his ass forward. Don Quixote, perceiving him in that  condition, said: \"Honest Sancho, that castle, or inn, I am now  convinced, is enchanted; for they who so cruelly sported with thee,  what could they be but phantoms and inhabitants of another world? And  I am confirmed in this from having found that, when I stood at the  pales of the yard, beholding the acts of your sad tragedy, I could not  possibly get over them, nor even alight from Rozinante; so that they  must certainly have held me enchanted. If I could have got over, or  alighted, I would have avenged thee in such a manner as would have  made those poltroons and assassins remember the jest as long as they  lived, even though I should have thereby transgressed the laws of  chivalry; for, as I have often told thee, they do not allow a knight  to lay hand on his sword against any one who is not so, unless it be  in defence of his own life and person, and in cases of urgent and  extreme necessity.\" \"And I too,\" quoth Sancho, \"would have revenged  myself if I had been able, knight or no knight, but I could not;  though, in my opinion, they who diverted themselves at my expense were  no hobgoblins, but men of flesh and bones, as we are; and each of  them, as I heard while they were tossing me, had his proper name; so  that, sir, as to your not being able to leap over the pales, nor to  alight from your horse, the fault lay not in enchantment, but in  something else. And what I gather clearly from all this is, that these  adventures we are in quest of will in the long-run bring us into so  many misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot. So  that, in my poor opinion, the better and surer way would be to return  to our village, now that it is reaping-time, and look after our  business, nor go rambling thus out of the frying-pan into the fire.\"    \"How little dost thou know, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"of what  appertains to chivalry! Peace, and have patience; for the day will  come when thine eyes shall witness how honourable a thing it is to  follow this profession. For tell me what greater satisfaction can the  world afford, or what pleasure can be compared with that of winning a  battle, and triumphing over an adversary? Undoubtedly none.\" \"It may  be so,\" answered Sancho, \"though I do not know it. I only know that  since we have been knights-errant, or since you have been one, sir  (for I have no right to reckon myself of that honourable number), we  have never won any battle; we have had nothing but drubbings upon  drubbings, cuffs upon cuffs, with my blanket-tossing into the bargain,  and that by persons enchanted, on whom I cannot revenge myself, and  thereby know what that pleasure of overcoming an enemy is which your  worship talks of.\" \"That is what troubles me, and ought to trouble  thee also, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote; \"but henceforward I will  endeavour to have ready at hand a sword made with such art that no  kind of enchantment can touch him that wears it; and perhaps fortune  may put me in possession of that of Amadis, when he called himself  'Knight of the Burning Sword,' which was one of the best weapons that  ever was worn by knight; for, beside the virtue aforesaid, it cut like  a razor; and no armour, however strong or enchanted, could withstand  it.\" \"Such is my luck,\" quoth Sancho, \"that though this were so, and  your worship should find such a sword, it would be of service only to  those who are dubbed knights; as for the poor squires, they may sing  sorrow.\" \"Fear not, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"Heaven will deal more  kindly by thee.\"    The knight and his squire went on conferring thus together, when Don  Quixote perceived, in the road on which they were travelling, a great  and thick cloud of dust coming towards them; upon which he turned to  Sancho, and said, \"This is the day, O Sancho, that shall manifest the  good that fortune hath in store for me. This is the day, I say, on  which shall be proved, as at all times, the valour of my arm; and on  which I shall perform exploits that will be recorded and written in  the book of fame, there to remain to all succeeding ages. Seest thou  that cloud of dust, Sancho? It is raised by a prodigious army of  divers nations, who are on the march this way.\" \"If so, there must be  two armies,\" said Sancho; \"for here, on this side, arises just another  cloud of dust.\" Don Quixote turned, and seeing that it really was so,  he rejoiced exceedingly, taking it for granted they were two armies  coming to engage in the midst of that spacious plain; for at all hours  and moments his imagination was full of the battles, enchantments,  adventures, extravagances, combats, and challenges detailed in his  favourite books; and in every thought, word, and action he reverted to  them. Now the cloud of dust he saw was raised by two great flocks of  sheep going the same road from different parts, and as the dust  concealed them until they came near, and Don Quixote affirmed so  positively that they were armies, Sancho began to believe it, and  said, \"Sir, what then must we do?\" \"What,\" replied Don Quixote, \"but  favour and assist the weaker side? Thou must know, Sancho, that the  army which marches towards us in front is led and commanded by the  great Emperor Alifanfaron, lord of the great island of Taprobana: this  other, which marches behind us, is that of his enemy, the king of the  Garamantes, Pentapolin of the Naked Arm--for he always enters into  battle with his right arm bare.\" \"But why do these two princes bear  one another so much ill-will?\" demanded Sancho. \"They hate one  another,\" answered Don Quixote, \"because this Alifanfaron is a furious  pagan, in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is most beautiful,  and also a Christian; but her father will not give her in marriage to  the pagan king unless he will first renounce the religion of his false  prophet Mahomet, and turn Christian.\" \"By my beard,\" said Sancho,  \"Pentapolin is in the right; and I am resolved to assist him to the  utmost of my power.\" \"Therein wilt thou do thy duty, Sancho,\" said Don  Quixote; \"but listen with attention whilst I give thee an account of  the principal knights in the two approaching armies; and, that thou  mayest observe them the better, let us retire to that rising ground,  whence both armies may be distinctly seen.\" Seeing, however, in his  imagination, what did not exist, he began, with a loud voice, to say:  \"The knight thou seest yonder with the gilded armour, who bears on his  shield a lion crowned, couchant at a damsel's feet, is the valorous  Laurcalco, Lord of the Silver Bridge. The other, with the armour  flowered with gold, who bears three crowns argent, in a field azure,  is the formidable Micocolembo, Grand Duke of Quiracia. The third, with  gigantic limbs, who marches on his right, is the undaunted  Brandabarbaran of Boliche, Lord of the three Arabias. He is armed with  a serpent's skin, and bears, instead of a shield, a gate, which fame  says is one of those belonging to the temple which Samson pulled down  when with his death he avenged himself upon his enemies.\"    In this manner he went on naming sundry knights of each squadron, as  his fancy dictated, and giving to each their arms, colours, devices,  and mottos, extempore; and, without pausing, he continued thus: \"That  squadron in the front is formed and composed of people of different  nations. Here stand those who drink the sweet waters of the famous  Xanthus; the mountaineers who tread the Massilian fields; those who  sift the pure and fine gold-dust of Arabia Felix; those who dwell  along the famous and refreshing banks of the clear Thermodon; those  who drain, by divers and sundry ways, the golden veins of Pactolus;  the Numidians, unfaithful in their promises; the Persians, famous for  bows and arrows; the Parthians and Medes, who fight flying; the  Arabians, perpetually changing their habitations; the Scythians, as  cruel as fair; the broad-lipped Ethiopians; and an infinity of other  nations, whose countenances I see and know, although I cannot  recollect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#19)"],[1," so many  kinds of property, using the word in its most general sense: they are  things which belong to us.\"      Shameful equivocation, not justified by the necessity for  generalization! The word PROPERTY has two meanings: 1. It designates the  quality which makes a thing what it is; the attribute which is peculiar  to it, and especially distinguishes it. We use it in this sense when we  say THE PROPERTIES OF THE TRIANGLE or of NUMBERS; THE PROPERTY OF THE  MAGNET, &c. 2. It expresses the right of absolute control over a thing  by a free and intelligent being. It is used in this sense by writers  on jurisprudence. Thus, in the phrase, IRON ACQUIRES THE PROPERTY OF A  MAGNET, the word PROPERTY does not convey the same idea that it does in  this one: _I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS MAGNET AS MY PROPERTY_. To tell a poor  man that he HAS property because he HAS arms and legs,--that the hunger  from which he suffers, and his power to sleep in the open air are his  property,--is to play upon words, and to add insult to injury.      \"The sole basis of the idea of property is the idea of personality. As  soon as property is born at all, it is born, of necessity, in all its  fulness. As soon as an individual knows HIMSELF,--his moral personality,  his capacities of enjoyment, suffering, and action,--he necessarily  sees also that this SELF is exclusive proprietor of the body in which  it dwells, its organs, their powers, faculties, &c.... Inasmuch as  artificial and conventional property exists, there must be natural  property also; for nothing can exist in art without its counterpart in  Nature.\"      We ought to admire the honesty and judgment of philosophers! Man has  properties; that is, in the first acceptation of the term, faculties. He  has property; that is, in its second acceptation, the right of domain.  He has, then, the property of the property of being proprietor. How  ashamed I should be to notice such foolishness, were I here considering  only the authority of Destutt de Tracy! But the entire human race, since  the origination of society and language, when metaphysics and dialectics  were first born, has been guilty of this puerile confusion of thought.  All which man could call his own was identified in his mind with his  person. He considered it as his property, his wealth; a part of himself,  a member of his body, a faculty of his mind. The possession of things  was likened to property in the powers of the body and mind; and on this  false analogy was based the right of property,--THE IMITATION OF NATURE  BY ART, as Destutt de Tracy so elegantly puts it.    But why did not this ideologist perceive that man is not proprietor even  of his own faculties? Man has powers, attributes, capacities; they are  given him by Nature that he may live, learn, and love: he does not own  them, but has only the use of them; and he can make no use of them that  does not harmonize with Nature's laws. If he had absolute mastery over  his faculties, he could avoid hunger and cold; he could eat unstintedly,  and walk through fire; he could move mountains, walk a hundred leagues  in a minute, cure without medicines and by the sole force of his will,  and could make himself immortal. He could say, \"I wish to produce,\" and  his tasks would be finished with the words; he could say. \"I wish to  know,\" and he would know; \"I love,\" and he would enjoy. What then? Man  is not master of himself, but may be of his surroundings. Let him use  the wealth of Nature, since he can live only by its use; but let him  abandon his pretensions to the title of proprietor, and remember that he  is called so only metaphorically.    To sum up: Destutt de Tracy classes together the external PRODUCTIONS of  nature and art, and the POWERS or FACULTIES of man, making both of them  species of property; and upon this equivocation he hopes to establish,  so firmly that it can never be disturbed, the right of property. But  of these different kinds of property some are INNATE, as memory,  imagination, strength, and beauty; while others are ACQUIRED, as land,  water, and forests. In the state of Nature or isolation, the strongest  and most skilful (that is, those best provided with innate property)  stand the best chance of obtaining acquired property. Now, it is to  prevent this encroachment and the war which results therefrom, that  a balance (justice) has been employed, and covenants (implied or  expressed) agreed upon: it is to correct, as far as possible, inequality  of innate property by equality of acquired property. As long as the  division remains unequal, so long the partners remain enemies; and it  is the purpose of the covenants to reform this state of things. Thus  we have, on the one hand, isolation, inequality, enmity, war, robbery,  murder; on the other, society, equality, fraternity, peace, and love.  Choose between them!    M. Joseph Dutens--a physician, engineer, and geometrician, but a very  poor legist, and no philosopher at all--is the author of a \"Philosophy  of Political Economy,\" in which he felt it his duty to break lances in  behalf of property. His reasoning seems to be borrowed from Destutt  de Tracy. He commences with this definition of property, worthy of  Sganarelle: \"Property is the right by which a thing is one's own.\"  Literally translated: Property is the right of property.    After getting entangled a few times on the subjects of will, liberty,  and personality; after having distinguished between IMMATERIAL-NATURAL  property, and MATERIAL-NATURAL property, a distinction similar to  Destutt de Tracy's of innate and acquired property,--M. Joseph Dutens  concludes with these two general propositions: 1. Property is a natural  and inalienable right of every man; 2. Inequality of property is a  necessary result of Nature,--which propositions are convertible into a  simpler one: All men have an equal right of unequal property.    He rebukes M. de Sismondi for having taught that landed property has no  other basis than law and conventionality; and he says himself, speaking  of the respect which people feel for property, that \"their good sense  reveals to them the nature of the ORIGINAL CONTRACT made between society  and proprietors.\"    He confounds property with possession, communism with equality, the just  with the natural, and the natural with the possible. Now he takes these  different ideas to be equivalents; now he seems to distinguish between  them, so much so that it would be infinitely easier to refute him than  to understand him. Attracted first by the title of the work, \"Philosophy  of Political Economy,\" I have found, among the author's obscurities,  only the most ordinary ideas. For that reason I will not speak of him.    M. Cousin, in his \"Moral Philosophy,\" page 15, teaches that all  morality, all laws, all rights are given to man with this injunction:  \"FREE BEING, REMAIN FREE.\" Bravo! master; I wish to remain free if I  can. He continues:--    \"Our principle is true; it is good, it is social. Do not fear to push it  to its ultimate.    \"1. If the human person is sacred, its whole nature is sacred; and  particularly its interior actions, its feelings, its thoughts, its  voluntary decisions. This accounts for the respect due to philosophy,  religion, the arts industry, commerce, and to all the results of  liberty. I say respect, not simply toleration; for we do not tolerate a  right, we respect it.\"    I bow my head before this philosophy.      \"2. My liberty, which is sacred, needs for its objective action an  instrument which we call the body: the body participates then in the  sacredness of liberty; it is then inviolable. This is the basis of the  principle of individual liberty.    \"3. My liberty needs, for its objective action, material to work upon;  in other words, property or a thing. This thing or property naturally  participates then in the inviolability of my person. For instance, I  take possession of an object which has become necessary and useful in  the outward manifestation of my liberty. I say, 'This object is  mine since it belongs to no one else; consequently, I possess it  legitimately.' So the legitimacy of possession rests on two conditions.  First, I possess only as a free being. Suppress free activity, you  destroy my power to labor. Now it is only by labor that I can use this  property or thing, and it is only by using it that I possess it. Free  activity is then the principle of the right of property. But that alone  does not legitimate possession. All men are free; all can use property  by labor. Does that mean that all men have a right to all property? Not  at all. To possess legitimately, I must not only labor and produce in  my capacity of a free being, but I must also be the first to occupy the  property. In short, if labor and production are the principle of the  right of property, the fact of first occupancy is its indispensable  condition.    \"4. I possess legitimately: then I have the right to use my property as  I see fit. I have also the right to give it away. I have also the right  to bequeath it; for if I decide to make a donation, my decision is as  valid after my death as during my life.\"    In fact, to become a proprietor, in M. Cousin's opinion, one must take  possession by occupation and labor. I maintain that the element of time  must be considered also; for if the first occupants have occupied every  thing, what are the new comers to do? What will become of them, having  an instrument with which to work, but no material to work upon?  Must they devour each other? A terrible extremity, unforeseen by  philosophical prudence; for the reason that great geniuses neglect  little things.    Notice also that M. Cousin says that neither occupation nor labor, taken  separately, can legitimate the right of property; and that it is born  only from the union of the two. This is one of M. Cousin's eclectic  turns, which he, more than any one else, should take pains to  avoid. Instead of "]]]
