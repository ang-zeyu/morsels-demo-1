When brought into the ant-hill these  larvae are placed in the jaws of slaves of their own species, who care  for them; they are born captives, and have neither the regret nor the  idea of a free life. Among the Amazons the slaves undertake every  labour; it is they who build and who care for the larvae of their  masters, as well as those carried away in expeditions. They have also  complicated personal services towards the _Polyergus_. They bring them  food, lick off the dust from their hairs, clean them, carry them from  one place to another, if there is need to emigrate, although they  themselves are much smaller. The masters, by force of losing interest  in work, lose also their votes when it is a question of taking a  resolution concerning the whole colony. The servants act on their own  initiative and their own responsibility, direct constructions  according to their own ideas, and even in grave concerns, such as  emigration, the idle masters do not seem to be consulted. The workers  deliberate among themselves, and having come to a decision, proceed to  execute it. They transport the household goods, the eggs, the future  of the city, and the Amazons who have become its parasites. It is a  most curious fact that the slaves should submit to this precarious  fate when their masters are absolutely dependent on them. It is just  to add that the robust mandibles of the latter may contribute to  preserve the position they enjoy.[70]       [70] Lubbock has a brief discussion on the relations of Ants          to their domestic animals and to their slaves, _Ants, Bees,          and Wasps_, chap. iv.

In other  cases these provisions are destined to feed the young. It is the same  industry, sometimes exercised for the preservation of the individual,  sometimes for the perpetuation of the race. We must expect to find  acts of the last kind more instinctive and less reflective than those  of the first, and this agrees well with what we know of natural  selection. If we now see living beings display so many resources and  calculate with such certainty all that will favour the healthy  development of their descendants, we must not necessarily conclude  that the species possess these instincts from the beginning. They are  not to be regarded as mechanisms artfully wound up and functioning  since the appearance of life on the earth with the same inevitable  regularity. The qualities which we find in them were weak at first;  they have developed in the course of ages, and have finally, by  heredity, been impressed upon the creatures to manifest themselves by  necessary acts from which there is no longer any escape. There is no  need for surprise if we meet to-day, I do not say among all, but among  a very large number of animals, this foresight for offspring in a  well-marked form. It is easy to understand that the species that first  acquired and fixed an instinct propitious to the increase of the race  has rapidly prospered, stifling beneath its extension those that are  less favoured from this point of view, which is of capital importance  in a struggle for a place beneath the sun. At the present day if the  struggle of animal life offers few facts of lack of foresight for the  rearing of young, it is because this defect has killed the races who  were subject to it; they have disappeared, or have only been saved by  qualities of another order.    For the rest, if it is difficult to reconstitute except in imagination  the different stages through which, in time, and in a determined  species, acts at first imperfect, but designed, have become perfect  and instinctive, we can at least find in space different degrees of  the same instinct in allied genera which lead us by a succession of  transitions from mechanical action to reflective action.    As I cannot quote all the facts showing this care for the future, I  will select a few. It must be said at first that a considerable number  of animals show nothing of the kind. Let us leave aside all the  inferior beings to speak of those among whom we may expect some degree  of method. Crustacea, fish, Batrachians, and many others lay their  eggs, are contented to conceal them a little so that they may not  become a too easy prey, and are altogether indifferent as to what may  happen afterwards. As soon as they come out, the young obtain their  own food from day to day; myriads are destroyed, and if the races  remain so strong numerically it is because they are saved by the  innumerable quantity of eggs produced by a single female. If it were  not for this prodigious fecundity these species would have  disappeared. Birds make no provision for their young; but, on the  other hand, as long as the latter are weak and unable to obtain their  own prey, the parents feed them every day by hunting both for  themselves and the brood.    I will not insist on those beings who, like mammals, produce  physiological reserves, not for their own use, but for the profit of  their young. The females of these animals elaborate materials from  their own organism and store them up in the form of milk to nourish  the young. This fact is related to foresight, with a view to  offspring, exactly in the same way as the Honey Ants show a  transformation of foresight for the individual. In both cases industry  is replaced by the function of a specially adapted organ.    _Foods manufactured by the parents for the young._--It is especially  insects with whose industries we are here concerned, and they are more  or less instinctive in various cases. Every one knows how the  Hymenoptera prepare honey from the pollen of flowers, to some extent  for themselves, but especially in order that their young may at the  moment of appearance possess a food which will enable them to undergo  their first metamorphosis sheltered from the inclemencies outside.  These foods are enclosed with great art, according to the species,  either in skilfully-constructed cells of wax, as by Bees, or in nests  of paper or cardboard which the Wasps fabricate, or again in huts  built of earth in the manner of the _Chalicodoma_.    _Species which obtain for their larvae foods manufactured by  others._--Other insects have not this taste for lengthy labours, and  do not know how to execute them; but they do not intend that their  young shall be the victims of maternal lack of skill, and they display  marvellous resources to enable them to profit by the foresight of  others.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    The _Sitaris muralis_, a beetle whose customs have been described by  Fabre in a remarkable manner,[71] may be counted among the cleverest  in assuring to its larvae the goods of others. It puts them in a  position to profit by it, and when they are installed they know  sufficiently well what to do. The species has so long perpetuated  itself by this process that it has become, both in mother and  offspring, highly automatic. It is a hymenopterous insect which this  family, whose first vital manifestation is theft, thus levies a  contribution on. It is called the _Anthophora pilifera_, and during  the fine weather it makes a collection of honey intended to be  absorbed by its own larvae, if it had not the misfortune to be watched  by one of these intriguing Coleoptera. Wherever in Provence there is a  perpendicular wall, natural or artificial, a little cliff, a sloping  ditch, or the wall of one of those caves which the people of the  country use for putting their tools in, the _Anthophora_ hollows out  galleries, at the bottom of which he builds a certain number of  chambers. He fills each of them with honey, places in it an egg which  floats in the midst of this little lake of nectar, and closes it all  up. The _Sitaris_ covets this honey to nourish its offspring, and the  chamber to shelter it. After having discovered one of the galleries of  which I have spoken, the female _Sitaris_ comes about the beginning of  September to lay her eggs, which are numerous, being not generally  fewer than two thousand. In the following month the larvae appear; they  are black, and swarm in a little heap mixed up with the remains of  egg-shells. They vegetate in this condition for a long time, and may  still be found there in May. At this period they have become more  active, and, in order to complete their development, are thinking of  profiting by their favourable situation near the entrance to a gallery  of the Hymenoptera; when a male _Anthophora_ comes within reach, two  or three of them catch hold of him and climb on to his thorax. They  maintain themselves there by clinging to the hairs. At the moment of  fertilisation the male, thus burdened, comes in contact with the  female; the coleopterous larvae then pass on to her, so that, according  to Fabre's expression, the meeting of the sexes brings death and life  to the eggs at the same time. Henceforth fixed on this laying insect,  the little _Sitaris_ remain quiet, and have only to wait; their future  is assured. The _Anthophora_ has made her chambers, and with the  greatest care has filled each of them with honey. Then in the midst  she deposits an egg, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#19)"],[1,"search of new  interests. The time had come when the young of the wilderness stood no  longer in need of protection. Then the hand of the law was lifted.    Instantly in the hearts of men the hunter's fever flamed up, and, with  eager eyes, they went forth to kill. Where they had yesterday walked  openly, hardly heeding the wild creatures about them, they now crept  stealthily, following the trails, or lying in ambush, waiting for the  unsuspicious flock to wing past. And when they found that the game,  yesterday so abundant and unwatchful, had to-day almost wholly  disappeared, they were indignant, and wished that they had anticipated  the season by a few hours.    As a matter of fact, the time of the ending of the truce was not the  same for all the wild creatures which had profited by its protection  through the spring and summer. Certain of the tribes, according to the  law's provisions, were secure for some weeks longer yet. But this they  never seemed to realize. As far as they could observe, when the truce  was broken for one it was broken for all, and all took alarm together.  In some unexplained way, perhaps by the mere transmission of a general  fear, word went around that the time had come for invisibility and  craft. All at once, therefore, as it seemed to men, the wilderness had  become empty.    Down a green, rough wood-road, leading from the Settlement to one of  the wild meadows by the river, came a young man in homespun carrying a  long, old-fashioned, muzzle-loading duck-gun. Two days before this he  had seen a fine buck, with antlers perfect and new-shining from the  velvet, feeding on the edge of this meadow. The young woodsman had  his gun loaded with buckshot. He wanted both venison and a pair of  horns; and, knowing the fancy of the deer for certain favourite  pastures, he had great hopes of finding the buck somewhere about the  place where he had last seen him. With flexible \"larrigans\" of oiled  cowhide on his feet, the hunter moved noiselessly and swiftly as a  panther, his keen pale-blue eyes peering from side to side through the  shadowy undergrowth. Not three steps aside from the path, moveless as  a stone and invisible among the spotted weeds and twigs, a crafty old  cock-partridge stood with head erect and unwinking eyes and watched  the dangerous intruder stride by.    Approaching the edge of the open, the young hunter kept himself  carefully hidden behind the fringing leafage and looked forth upon the  little meadow. No creature being in sight, he cut straight across the  grass to the water's edge, and scanned the muddy margin for  foot-prints. These he presently found in abundance, along between  grass and sedge. Most of the marks were old; but others were so fresh  that he knew the buck must have been there and departed within the  last ten minutes. Into some deep hoof-prints the water was still  oozing, while from others the trodden stems of sedge were slowly  struggling upright.    A smile of keen satisfaction passed over the young woodsman's face at  these signs. He prided himself on his skill in trailing, and the  primeval predatory elation thrilled his nerves. At a swift but easy  lope he took up that clear trail, and followed it back through the  grass toward the woods. It entered the woods not ten paces from the  point where the hunter himself had emerged, ran parallel with the old  wood-road for a dozen yards, and came to a plain halt in the heart of  a dense thicket of hemlock. From the thicket it went off in great  leaps in a direction at right angles to the path. There was not a  breath of wind stirring, to carry a scent. So the hunter realized that  his intended victim had been watching him from the thicket, and that  it was now a case of craft against craft. He tightened his belt for a  long chase, and set his lean jaws doggedly as he resumed the trail.    The buck, who was wise with the wisdom of experience, and apprised by  the echoes of the first gunshot of the fact that the truce was over,  had indeed been watching the hunter very sagaciously. The moment he  was satisfied that it was his trail the hunter was following, he had  set out at top speed, anxious to get as far as possible from so  dangerous a neighbourhood. At first his fear grew with his flight, so  that his great, soft eyes stared wildly and his nostrils dilated as he  went bounding over all obstacles. Then little by little the triumphant  exercise of his powers, and a realization of how far his speed  surpassed that of his pursuer, reassured him somewhat. He decided to  rest, and find out what his foe was doing. He doubled back parallel  with his own trail for about fifty yards, then lay down in a thicket  to watch the enemy go by.    In an incredibly short time he did go by, at that long, steady swing  which ate up the distance so amazingly. As soon as he was well past,  the buck sprang up and was off again at full speed, his heart once  more thumping with terror.    This time, however, instead of running straight ahead, he made a wide,  sweeping curve, tending back toward the river and the lakes. As  before, only somewhat sooner, his alarm subsided and his confidence,  along with his curiosity, returned. He repeated his former manoeuvre  of doubling back a little way upon his trail, then again lay down to  wait for the passing of his foe.    When the hunter came to that first abrupt turn of the trail he  realized that it was a cunning and experienced buck with which he had  to deal. He smiled confidently, however, feeling sure of his own  skill, and ran at full speed to the point where the animal had lain  down to watch him pass. From this point he followed the trail just far  enough to catch its curve. Then he left it and ran in a straight line  shrewdly calculated to form the chord to his quarry's section of a  circle. His plan was to intercept and pick up the trail again about  three quarters of a mile further on. In nine cases out of ten his  calculation would have worked out as he wished; but in this case he  had not made allowance for this particular buck's individuality. While  he imagined his quarry to be yet far ahead, he ran past a leafy clump  of mingled Indian pear and thick spruce seedlings. Half a minute later  he heard a crash of underbrush behind him. As he turned he caught a  tantalizing glimpse of tawny haunches vanishing through the green, and  he knew that once again he had been outplayed.    This time the wise buck was distinctly more terrified than before. The  appearance of his enemy at this unexpected point, so speedily, and not  upon the trail, struck a panic to his heart. Plainly, this was no  common foe, to be evaded by familiar stratagems. His curiosity and his  confidence disappeared completely.    [Illustration: \"RUNNING IN THE SHALLOW WATER TO COVER HIS SCENT\"]    The buck set off in a straight line for the river, now perhaps a  half-mile distant. Reaching it, he turned down the shore, running in  the shallow water to cover his scent. It never occurred to him that  his enemy was trailing him by sight, not by scent; so he followed the  same tactics he would have employed had the pursuer been a wolf or a  dog. A hundred yards further on he rounded a sharp bend of the stream.  Here he took to deep water, swam swiftly to the opposite shore, and  vanished into the thick woods.    Two or three minutes later the man came out upon the river's edge. The  direction his quarry had taken was plainly visible by the splashes of  water on the rocks, and he smiled grimly at the precaution which the  animal had taken to cover his secret. But when he reached the point  where the buck had taken to deep water the smile faded. He stopped,  leaning on his gun and staring across the river, and a baffled look  came over his face. Realizing, after a few moments, that he was beaten  in this game, he drew out his charge of buckshot, reloaded his gun  with small duckshot, and hid himself in a waterside covert of young  willows, in the hope that a flock of mallard or teal might presently  come by.          THE WINDOW IN THE SHACK      THE attitude in which the plump baby hung limply over the woman's left  arm looked most uncomfortable. The baby, however, seemed highly  content. Both his sticky fists clutched firmly a generous \"chunk\" of  new maple-sugar, which he mumbled with his toothless gums, while his  big eyes, widening like an owl's, stared about through the dusk with a  placid intentness.    From the woman's left hand dangled an old tin lantern containing a  scrap of tallow candle, whose meagre gleam flickered hither and  thither apprehensively among the huge shadows of the darkening wood.  In her right hand the woman carried a large tin bucket, half filled  with fresh-run maple-sap. By the glimmer of the ineffectual candle,  she moved wearily from one great maple to another, emptying the  birch-bark cups that hung from the little wooden taps driven into the  trunks. The night air was raw with the chill of thawing snow, and  carried no sound but the soft tinkle of the sap as it dript swiftly  into the birchen cups. The faint, sweet smell of the sap seemed to  cling upon the darkness. The candle flared up for an instant,  revealing black, mysterious aisles among the ponderous tree-trunks,  then guttered down and almost went out, the darkness seeming to swoop  in upon its defeat. The woman examined it, found that it was all but  done, and glanced nervously over her shoulder. Then she made anxious  haste to empty and replace the last of the birchen cups before she  should be left in darkness to grope her way back to the cabin.    The sap was running freely that spring, and the promise of a great  sugar-harvest was not to be ignored. Dave Stone's house and farm lay  about three miles distant, across the valley of the \"Tin Kittle,\" from  the maple-clad ridge of forest wherein he had his sugar-camp. The camp  consisted of a little cabin or \"shack\" of rough boards and an open  shed with a "]]]
