It appears, therefore, that in proportion to the       population the length of railways in the United States       is greater than in the United Kingdom in the ratio of       46 to 24.         On the American railways passengers are not differently       classed or received at different rates of fare as on       those of Europe. There is but one class and one fare.       The only distinction observable arises from color. The       colored population, whether emancipated or not, are       generally excluded from the vehicles provided for the       whites. Such travellers are but few, and are usually       accommodated either in the luggage van or in the       carriage with the guard or conductor. But little       merchandise is transported, the cost of transport being       greater than goods in general are capable of paying;       nevertheless, a tariff regulated by weight alone,       without distinction of classes, is fixed for       merchandise.         Although Cuba is not yet _annexed_ to the United       States, its local proximity here suggests some notice       of a line of railway which traverses that island,       forming a communication between the city of Havana and       the centre of the island. This is an excellently       constructed road, and capitally worked by British       engines, British engineers, and British coals. The       impressions produced in passing along this line of       railway, though different from those already noticed in       the forests of the far west, is not less remarkable. We       are here transported at 30 miles an hour by an engine       from Newcastle, driven by an engineer from Manchester,       and propelled by fuel from Liverpool, through fields       yellow with pineapples, through groves of plantain and       cocoa-nut, and along roads inclosed by hedge-rows of       ripe oranges.         To what extent this extraordinary rapidity of       advancement made by the United States in its inland       communications is observable in other departments will       be seen by the following table, exhibiting a       comparative statement of those _data_, derived from       official sources, which indicate the social and       commercial condition of a people through a period which       forms but a small stage in the life of a nation:                                                1793.            1851.

In an interval of little more than half a       century it appears that this extraordinary people have       increased above 500 per cent. in numbers; their       national revenue has augmented nearly 700 per cent.,       while their public expenditure has increased little       more than 400 per cent. The prodigious extension of       their commerce is indicated by an increase of nearly       500 per cent. in their imports and exports and 600 per       cent. in their shipping. The increased activity of       their internal communications is expounded by the       number of their post offices, which has been increased       more than a hundred-fold, the extent of their post       roads, which has been increased thirty-six-fold, and       the cost of their post-office, which has been augmented       in a seventy-two-fold ratio. The augmentation of their       machinery of public instruction is indicated by the       extent of their public libraries, which have increased       in a thirty-two-fold ratio, and by the creation of       school libraries, amounting to 2,000,000 volumes. They       have completed a system of canal navigation, which,       placed in a continuous line, would extend from London       to Calcutta, and a system of railways which,       continuously extended, would stretch from London to Van       Diemen's Land, and have provided locomotive machinery       by which that distance would be travelled over in three       weeks, at the cost of 1-1/2d. per mile. They have       created a system of inland navigation, the aggregate       tonnage of which is probably not inferior in amount to       the collective inland tonnage of all the other       countries in the world, and they possess many hundreds       of river steamers, which impart to the roads of water       the marvellous celerity of roads of iron. They have, in       fine, constructed lines of electric telegraph which,       laid continuously, would extend over a space longer by       3,000 miles than the distance from the north to the       south pole, and have provided apparatus of transmission       by which a message of 300 words despatched under such       circumstances from the north pole might be delivered       _in writing_ at the south pole in one minute, and by       which, consequently, an answer of equal length might be       sent back to the north pole in an equal interval.         These are social and commercial phenomena for which it       would be vain to seek a parallel in the past history of       the human race.          THE LAST EARTHQUAKE IN EUROPE.      A correspondent of the _Athenaeum_ gives the following account--the best we  have yet seen--of the recent earthquake at Amalfi, in the kingdom of  Naples:--         \"I have, however, seen several persons from Malfi; and       from their narratives will endeavor to give you some       idea of this awful visitation. The morning of the 14th       of August was very sultry, and a leaden atmosphere       prevailed. It was remarked that an unusual silence       appeared to extend over the animal world. The hum of       insects ceased--the feathered tribes were mute--not a       breath of wind moved the arid vegetation. About       half-past two o'clock the town of Malfi rocked for       about six seconds, and nearly every building fell in.       The number of edifices actually levelled with the earth       is 163--of those partially destroyed 98, and slightly       damaged 180. Five monastic establishments were       destroyed, and seven churches including the cathedral.       The awful event occurred at a time when most of the       inhabitants of a better condition were at dinner; and       the result is, that out of the whole population only a       few peasants laboring in the fields escaped. More than       700 dead bodies have already been dug out of the ruins,       and it is supposed that not less than 800 are yet       entombed. A college accommodating 65 boys and their       teachers is no longer traceable. But the melancholy       event does not end here. The adjoining village of       Ascoli has also suffered:--32 houses laving fallen in,       and the church being levelled with the ground. More       than 200 persons perished there. Another small town,       Barile, has actually disappeared; and a lake has arisen       from the bowels of the earth, the waters being warm and       brackish.         \"I proceed to give a few anecdotes, as narrated by       persons who have arrived in Naples from the scene of       horror:--'I was travelling,' says one, 'within a mile       of Malfi when I observed three cars drawn by oxen. In a       moment the two most distant fell into the earth; from       the third I observed a man and a boy descend and run       into a vineyard which skirted the road. Shortly after,       I think about three seconds, the third car was       swallowed up. We stopped our carriage, and proceeded to       the spot where the man and boy stood. The former I       found stupified--he was both deaf and dumb; the boy       appeared to be out of his mind, and spoke wildly, but       eventually recovered. The poor man still remains       speechless.' Another informant says:--'Malfi, and all       around present a singular and melancholy appearance:       houses levelled or partially fallen in--here and there       the ground broken up--large gaps displaying volcanic       action--people wandering about stupified--men searching       in the ruins--women weeping--children here and there       crying for their parents, and some wretched examples of       humanity carrying off articles of furniture. The       authorities are nowhere to be found.' A third person       states:--'I am from Malfi, and was near a monastery       when the earthquake occurred. A peasant told me that       the water in a neighboring well was quite hot,--a few       moments after I saw the building fall. I fell on the       ground, and saw nothing more. I thought that I had had       a fit.'         \"The town of Malfi--or, Amalfi--is 150 miles from       Naples, and about the centre of the boot. It is       difficult, therefore, to gain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#19)"],[1,"um.      Had we turned our back only thirty-eight years ago on Fremiet's statue  of Joan of Arc (which was not there then) in the Place de Rivoli, and  walked down what is now the Rue de Tuileries towards the Seine, we  should have had on our left hand a beautiful and imposing  building--the Palace of the Tuileries, which united the two wings of  the Louvre that now terminate in the Pavillon de Marsan just by the  Place de Rivoli and the Pavillon de Flore on the Quai des Tuileries.  The palace stretched right across this interval, thus interrupting the  wonderful vista of to-day from the old Louvre right away to the Arc de  Triomphe--probably the most extraordinary and beautiful civilised, or  artificial, vista in the world. The palace had, however, a  sufficiently fine if curtailed share of it from its own windows.    All Parisians upwards of forty-five must remember the Palace  perfectly, for it was not destroyed until 1871, during the Commune,  and it was some years after that incendiary period before all traces  were removed and the gardens spread uninterruptedly from the Carrousel  to the Concorde.    The Palace of the Tuileries (so called because it occupied a site  previously covered by tile kilns) was begun in 1564 and had therefore  lived for three centuries. Catherine de Medicis planned it, but, as we  shall read later, she lost interest in it very quickly owing to one of  those inconvenient prophecies which were wont in earlier times so to  embarrass rulers, but which to-day in civilised countries have  entirely gone out. The Tuileries was a happy enough palace, as palaces  go, until the Revolution: it then became for a while the very centre  of rebellion and carnage; for Louis XVI. and the Royal Family were  conveyed thither after the fatal oath had been sworn in the Versailles  tennis-court. Then came the critical 10th of August, when the King  consented to attend the conference in the Manege (now no more, but a  tablet opposite the Rue Castiglione marks the spot) and thus lost  everything.    The massacre of the Swiss Guards followed: but here it is impossible,  or at least absurd, not to hear Carlyle. Mandal, Commander of the  National Guard, I would premise, has been assassinated by the crowd;  the Constitutional Assembly sits in the Manege, and the King, a  prisoner in the Tuileries, but still a hesitant and an optimist, is  ordered to attend it. At last he consents. \"King Louis sits, his hands  leant on his knees, body bent forward; gazes for a space fixedly on  Syndic Roederer; then answers, looking over his shoulder to the  Queen: _Marchons!_ They march; King Louis, Queen, Sister Elizabeth,  the two royal children and governess: these, with Syndic Roederer,  and Officials of the Department; amid a double rank of National  Guards. The men with blunderbusses, the steady red Swiss gaze  mournfully, reproachfully; but hear only these words from Syndic  Roederer: 'The King is going to the Assembly; make way'. It has  struck eight, on all clocks, some minutes ago: the King has left the  Tuileries--forever.      [Illustration: THE PARC MONCEAU]    \"O ye stanch Swiss, ye gallant gentlemen in black, for what a cause  are ye to spend and be spent! Look out from the western windows, ye  may see King Louis placidly hold on his way; the poor little Prince  Royal 'sportfully kicking the fallen leaves'. Fremescent multitude on  the Terrace of the Feuillants whirls parallel to him; one man in it,  very noisy, with a long pole: will they not obstruct the outer  Staircase, and back-entrance of the Salle, when it comes to that?  King's Guards can go no farther than the bottom step there. Lo,  Deputation of Legislators come out; he of the long pole is stilled by  oratory; Assembly's Guards join themselves to King's Guards, and all  may mount in this case of necessity; the outer Staircase is free, or  passable. See, Royalty ascends; a blue Grenadier lifts the poor  little Prince Royal from the press; Royalty has entered in. Royalty  has vanished for ever from your eyes.--And ye? Left standing there,  amid the yawning abysses, and earthquake of Insurrection; without  course; without command: if ye perish, it must be as more than  martyrs, as martyrs who are now without a cause! The black Courtiers  disappear mostly; through such issues as they can. The poor Swiss know  not how to act: one duty only is clear to them, that of standing by  their post; and they will perform that.    \"But the glittering steel tide has arrived; it beats now against the  Chateau barriers and eastern Courts; irresistible, loud-surging far  and wide;--breaks in, fills the Court of the Carrousel, blackbrowed  Marseillese in the van. King Louis gone, say you; over to the  Assembly! Well and good: but till the Assembly pronounce Forfeiture of  him, what boots it? Our post is in that Chateau or stronghold of his;  there till then must we continue. Think, ye stanch Swiss, whether it  were good that grim murder began, and brothers blasted one another in  pieces for a stone edifice?--Poor Swiss! they know not how to act:  from the southern windows, some fling cartridges, in sign of  brotherhood; on the eastern outer staircase, and within through long  stairs and corridors, they stand firm-ranked, peaceable and yet  refusing to stir. Westermann speaks to them in Alsatian German;  Marseillese plead, in hot Provencal speech and pantomime; stunning  hubbub pleads and threatens, infinite, around. The Swiss stand  fast, peaceable and yet immovable; red granite pier in that  waste-flashing sea of steel.    \"Who can help the inevitable issue; Marseillese and all France on this  side; granite Swiss on that? The pantomime grows hotter and hotter;  Marseillese sabres flourishing by way of action; the Swiss brow also  clouding itself, the Swiss thumb bringing its firelock to the cock.  And hark! high thundering above all the din, three Marseillese cannon  from the Carrousel, pointed by a gunner of bad aim, come rattling over  the roofs! Ye Swiss, therefore: _Fire!_ The Swiss fire; by volley, by  platoon, in rolling fire: Marseillese men not a few, and 'a tall man  that was louder than any,' lie silent, smashed upon the pavement;--not  a few Marseillese, after the long dusty march, have made halt _here_.  The Carrousel is void; the black tide recoiling; 'fugitives rushing as  far as Saint-Antoine before they stop'. The Cannoneers without  linstock have squatted invisible, and left their cannon; which the  Swiss seize....    \"Behold, the fire slackens not; nor does the Swiss rolling-fire  slacken from within. Nay they clutched cannon, as we saw; and now,  from the other side, they clutch three pieces more; alas, cannon  without linstock; nor will the steel-and-flint answer, though they try  it. Had it chanced to answer! Patriot onlookers have their misgivings;  one strangest Patriot onlooker thinks that the Swiss, had they a  commander, would beat. He is a man not unqualified to judge; the name  of him Napoleon Buonaparte. And onlookers, and women, stand gazing,  and the witty Dr. Moore of Glasgow among them, on the other side of  the River: cannon rush rumbling past them; pause on the Pont Royal;  belch out their iron entrails there, against the Tuileries; and at  every new belch, the women and onlookers 'shout and clap hands'.  City of all the Devils! In remote streets, men are drinking  breakfast-coffee; following their affairs; with a start now and then,  as some dull echo reverberates a note louder. And here? Marseillese  fall wounded; but Barbaroux has surgeons; Barbaroux is close by,  managing, though underhand and under cover. Marseillese fall  death-struck; bequeath their firelock, specify in which pocket are the  cartridges; and die murmuring, 'Revenge me, Revenge thy country!'  Brest Federe Officers, galloping in red coats, are shot as Swiss. Lo  you, the Carrousel has burst into flame!--Paris Pandemonium! Nay the  poor City, as we said, is in fever-fit and convulsion: such crisis has  lasted for the space of some half hour.    \"But what is this that, with Legislative Insignia, ventures through  the hubbub and death-hail, from the back-entrance of the Manege?  Towards the Tuileries and Swiss: written Order from his Majesty to  cease firing! O ye hapless Swiss, why was there no order not to begin  it? Gladly would the Swiss cease firing: but who will bid mad  Insurrection cease firing? To Insurrection you cannot speak; neither  can it, hydra-headed, hear. The dead and dying, by the hundred, lie  all around; are borne bleeding through the streets, towards help; the  sight of them, like a torch of the Furies, kindling Madness. Patriot  Paris roars; as the bear bereaved of her whelps. On, ye Patriots:  Vengeance! Victory or death! There are men seen, who rush on, armed  only with walking-sticks. Terror and Fury rule the hour.    \"The Swiss, pressed on from without, paralysed from within, have  ceased to shoot; but not to be shot. What shall they do? Desperate is  the moment. Shelter or instant death: yet How, Where? One party flies  out by the Rue de l'Echelle; is destroyed utterly, '_en entier_'. A  second, by the other side, throws itself into the Garden; 'hurrying  across a keen fusillade'; rushes suppliant into the National Assembly;  finds pity and refuge in the back benches there. The third, and  largest, darts out in column, three hundred strong, towards the Champs  Elysees: 'Ah, could we but reach Courbevoye, where other Swiss are!'  Wo! see, in such fusillade the column 'soon breaks itself by diversity  of opinion,' into distracted segments, this way and that;--to escape  in holes, to die fighting from street to street. The firing and  murdering will not cease; not yet for long. The red Porters of Hotels  are shot at, be they _Suisse_ by nature, or _Suisse_ only in name....    \"Surely few things in the history of carnage are painfuller. What  ineffaceable red streak, flickering so sad in the memory, is that, of  this poor column of red"]]]
