This faculty of foreseeing the path along which humanity must  move, is common in a greater or less degree to all men.  But in  all times there have been men in whom this faculty was especially  strong, and these men have given clear and definite expression to  what all men felt vaguely, and formed a new philosophy of life  from which new lines of action followed for hundreds and thousands  of years.    Of such philosophies of life we know three; two have already been  passed through by humanity, and the third is that we are passing  through now in Christianity.  These philosophies of life are three  in number, and only three, not because we have arbitrarily brought  the various theories of life together under these three heads, but  because all men's actions are always based on one of these three  views of life--because we cannot view life otherwise than in these  three ways.    These three views of life are as follows: First, embracing the  individual, or the animal view of life; second, embracing the  society, or the pagan view of life; third, embracing the whole  world, or the divine view of life.    In the first theory of life a man's life is limited to his one  individuality; the aim of life is the satisfaction of the will of  this individuality.  In the second theory of life a man's life is  limited not to his own individuality, but to certain societies and  classes of individuals: to the tribe, the family, the clan, the  nation; the aim of life is limited to the satisfaction of the will  of those associations of individuals.  In the third theory of life  a man's life is limited not to societies and classes of  individuals, but extends to the principle and source of life--to  God.    These three conceptions of life form the foundation of all the  religious that exist or have existed.    The savage recognizes life only in himself and his personal  desires. His interest in life is concentrated on himself alone.  The highest happiness for him is the fullest satisfaction of his  desires. The motive power of his life is personal enjoyment. His  religion consists in propitiating his deity and in worshiping his  gods, whom he imagines as persons living only for their personal  aims.    The civilized pagan recognizes life not in himself alone, but in  societies of men--in the tribe, the clan, the family, the kingdom  --and sacrifices his personal good for these societies.  The  motive power of his life is glory.  His religion consists in the  exaltation of the glory of those who are allied to him--the  founders of his family, his ancestors, his rulers--and in  worshiping gods who are exclusively protectors of his clan, his  family, his nation, his government [see Footnote].        [Footnote: The fact that so many varied forms of      existence, as the life of the family, of the tribe,      of the clan, of the state, and even the life of      humanity theoretically conceived by the Positivists,      are founded on this social or pagan theory of life,      does not destroy the unity of this theory of life.      All these varied forms of life are founded on the      same conception, that the life of the individual is      not a sufficient aim of life--that the meaning of      life can be found only in societies of individuals.]    The man who holds the divine theory of life recognizes life not in  his own individuality, and not in societies of individualities (in  the family, the clan, the nation, the tribe, or the government),  but in the eternal undying source of life--in God; and to fulfill  the will of God he is ready to sacrifice his individual and family  and social welfare.  The motor power of his life is love.  And his  religion is the worship in deed and in truth of the principle of  the whole--God.    The whole historic existence of mankind is nothing else than the  gradual transition from the personal, animal conception of life to  the social conception of life, and from the social conception of  life to the divine conception of life.  The whole history of the  ancient peoples, lasting through thousands of years and ending  with the history of Rome, is the history of the transition from  the animal, personal view of life to the social view of life.  The  whole of history from the time of the Roman Empire and the  appearance of Christianity is the history of the transition,  through which we are still passing now, from the social view of  life to the divine view of life.    This view of life is the last, and founded upon it is the  Christian teaching, which is a guide for the whole of our life and  lies at the root of all our activity, practical and theoretic.  Yet men of what is falsely called science, pseudo-scientific men,  looking at it only in its externals, regard it as something  outgrown and having no value for us.    Reducing it to its dogmatic side only--to the doctrines of the  Trinity, the redemption, the miracles, the Church, the sacraments,  and so on--men of science regard it as only one of an immense  number of religions which have arisen among mankind, and now, they  say, having played out its part in history, it is outliving its  own age and fading away before the light of science and of true  enlightenment.    We come here upon what, in a large proportion of cases, forms the  source of the grossest errors of mankind.  Men on a lower level of  understanding, when brought into contact with phenomena of a  higher order, instead of making efforts to understand them, to  raise themselves up to the point of view from which they must look  at the subject, judge it from their lower standpoint, and the less  they understand what they are talking about, the more confidently  and unhesitatingly they pass judgment on it.    To the majority of learned then, looking at the living, moral teaching  of Christ from the lower standpoint of the conception of life, this  doctrine appears as nothing but very indefinite and incongruous  combination of Indian asceticism, Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophy, and  insubstantial anti-social visions, which have no serious significance  for our times. Its whole meaning is concentrated for them in its  external manifestations--in Catholicism, Protestantism, in certain  dogmas, or in the conflict with the temporal power. Estimating the value  of Christianity by these phenomena is like a deaf man's judging of the  character and quality of music by seeing the movements of the musicians.    The result of this is that all these scientific men, from Kant,  Strauss, Spencer, and Renan down, do not understand the meaning of  Christ's sayings, do not understand the significance, the object,  or the reason of their utterance, do not understand even the  question to which they form the answer.  Yet, without even taking  the pains to enter into their meaning, they refuse, if unfavorably  disposed, to recognize any reasonableness in his doctrines; or if  they want to treat them indulgently, they condescend, from the  height of their superiority, to correct them, on the supposition  that Christ meant to express precisely their own ideas, but did  not succeed in doing so.  They behave to his teaching much as  self-assertive people talk to those whom they consider beneath  them, often supplying their companions' words: \"Yes, you mean to  say this and that.\"  This correction is always with the aim of  reducing the teaching of the higher, divine conception of life to  the level of the lower, state conception of life.    They usually say that the moral teaching of Christianity is very  fine, but overexaggerated; that to make it quite right we must  reject all in it that is superfluous and unnecessary to our manner  of life.  \"And the doctrine that asks too much, and requires what  cannot be performed, is worse than that which requires of men what  is possible and consistent with their powers,\" these learned  interpreters of Christianity maintain, repeating what was long ago  asserted, and could not but be asserted, by those who crucified  the Teacher because they did not understand him--the Jews.    It seems that in the judgment of the learned men of our  time the Hebrew law--a tooth for a tooth, and an eye for  an eye--is a law of just retaliation, known to mankind five  thousand years before the law of holiness which Christ  taught in its place.    It seems that all that has been done by those men who understood  Christ's teaching literally and lived in accordance with such an  understanding of it, all that has been said and done by all true  Christians, by all the Christian saints, all that is now reforming  the world in the shape of socialism and communism--is simply  exaggeration, not worth talking about.    After eighteen hundred years of education in Christianity the  civilized world, as represented by its most advanced thinkers,  holds the conviction that the Christian religion is a religion of  dogmas; that its teaching in relation to life is unreasonable, and  is an exaggeration, subversive of the real lawful obligations of  morality consistent with the nature of man; and that very doctrine  of retribution which Christ rejected, and in place of which he put  his teaching, is more practically useful for us.    To learned men the doctrine of non-resistance to evil by force is  exaggerated and even irrational.  Christianity is much better  without it, they think, not observing closely what Christianity,  as represented by them, amounts to.    They do not see that to say that the doctrine of non-resistance to  evil is an exaggeration in Christ's teaching is just like saying  that the statement of the equality of the radii of a circle is an  exaggeration in the definition of a circle.  And those who speak  thus are acting precisely like a man who, having no idea of what a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#19)"],[1,"your hand from an  upper room and pluck the creepers which pour in a green cascade  over the rocks. It is extremely primitive: the menu consists of  soup, macaroni, eggs, fresh fish from the lake, and very lean  chickens, supplemented by rough country bread, plenty of honey and  fresh fruit, and cheese if the proprietor has lately been to market  in Perugia. Meat there is none, at any rate in August, nor tea.  But the rooms are spotlessly clean, with snowy beds, dainty white  valances, curtains edged with hand-made lace, and the finest of  linen towels; the daughter of the buxom landlady is as charming as  she is elegant, and the serving girl is a beautiful Murillo.    Passignano is full of beautiful women; they form two-thirds of the  population of this little lake-side town. There are hardly any men  in it except the old fishermen, and a few young lads, apprentices  to bootmakers and saddlers. All the rest have drifted away to the  towns, or have farms out in the _paese_. And the women, from the  pretty French wife of Signor Arturo of the Albergo Balducci, with  her freshly laundered cotton dresses, to the little bareheaded  girls whose mothers call to them at night, bidding them bathe their  dusty feet in the lake before they come to bed, are all lovely.  They are noted for it.    The only other visitor in Passignano that August was a young  Apollo--so beautifully dressed in pale grey riding-clothes that he  looked as if he must have slipped out of a George Edwards musical  comedy. He was, according to the landlady, a student from the  University of Perugia, spending his vacation in Passignano because  the girls were so beautiful! Oh, young Italy! How natural and  unaffected you are! I loved to see him strolling down the village  street with a lordly air of indifference, running the gauntlet  of eyes as the pretty girls, linked in groups like bouquets of  flowers, passed him demurely; while their mothers, sitting on the  doorsteps of their cottages, scanned the handsome boy with kindly  humour.    Everybody lives out of doors in Passignano. The women are always  sitting outside their houses; and their children, half-naked in the  summer heat, with halos of sunburned curls, pillow their heads on  the rough cobbles of the hilly streets, and sleep after their play,  as baby angels might sleep in paradise, tired out with singing.  The stables and bakeries and workshops are open to the road, and  above them the shabby brown houses clamber up the hillside to the  Fortezza, which rears its shaggy head above the highest of their  pagoda-like chimneys.    'If we stay here we shall prolong our lives for always,' cried the  philosopher. 'Already I have forgotten the world!'    And he fell to imitating the song of the cicalas.    Indeed for us the world was standing still. We were caught in a  mesh of beauty as in a summer daydream. The waves of Time seemed  to retreat, leaving us like swimmers resting on a golden shore  after struggle and turmoil. It might have been Lethe whose waters  sang to the stones at our feet: for we forgot the world: its voice  became a dream; we found ourselves content to watch the changing  lights as the hours drifted away.    [Illustration: CHIMNEYS AT PASSIGNANO.]    We ate our meals in the unfinished dining-room which Signor  Balducci is building out over the lake--a mere shell of white  plaster with empty doors and windows through which the little  breezes strayed. There were flowers on the cloth beside our plates,  and a great bowl of oleanders, geraniums and white asters on the  table. We breakfasted off golden bread and honey, and the pretty  waiting girl brought tuberoses with our coffee. Outside, the lake  was a tender morning blue; its surface rippled to the cool breath  of the mountains, and sparkled in the sunlight. The bent and  twisted sticks of the fishermen cast fantastic reflections in the  water, and were beautified, as all humble and work-a-day things are  beautified in Italy, by the magic of the sun. Further out two men  in a rickety sampan were hauling in their nets.    It was a scene of infinite romance. The towers of Castiglione shone  like ivory out of the violet mists, and many of the hills which  rose above them bore turreted towns upon their crests. Behind them  we knew lay Siena, Montepulciano and Chiusi, and to the right  Cortona and Arezzo, and there Perugia, and Assisi there. History  swept down upon us too. Thrasymene and its vine-clad slopes are  full of memories of Hannibal, the stormy petrel who beat his wings  round Rome in vain. Nor does it lack for gentler associations,  for Saint Francis of Assisi, who had been preaching in one of the  lake-side towns, was inspired, according to the author of the  _Fioretti_, to spend Lent on an island in its midst. Which he  did, in solitary prayer and meditation, eating only the half of  one small loaf of bread, 'from reverence for the fast of Christ  the blessed one, Who fasted forty days and forty nights without  partaking any earthly food; but in this manner, with that half a  loaf, chased far the venom of vain glory from him.'    Towards the hour of sunset, when the shadowed hills grew blue and  misty, and the lake was a mirror of pale gold, we walked along the  reedy shore of Thrasymene. The wind rustled in the silken leaves  of the maize, and made a music like far-off singing in the emerald  reeds. We went down to the edge of the water where the gardens  sloped to the lake, and we found flowers there and herbs--mint and  thyme and rosemary that scented the air, and purple vetches and  clover, and the beautiful cow-parsley whose blossoms float like  butterflies over every hedge and waste ground. And there we waited  while the sky glowed from gold to rose, and Thrasymene seemed  aflame with Hannibal's desire for Rome.    We dined in our alfresco dining-room, and afterwards we walked  again by the still waters, where the frogs were shrilling a chorus  to the night-crickets, whose song in the grass is like the sound of  a curb-chain being rubbed in the hand. Except for these the world  was still. There were no lights along that mysterious country road  except the stars, and rarely have I seen them brighter, even in  Africa.    'In a town we never see such stars as these,' said the philosopher.  We never do. The Milky Way stretched like a girdle across the  heavens, and was reflected in the lake like a pale moon. We stayed  to watch it, and to listen to the voices of the night.    A train glared out of the tunnel which pierces the hill below  Passignano, and tore along in the darkness beside the road,  lightening our starlit gloom for a moment before its meteoric tail  of windows was swallowed up by the night. Then we saw a glow-worm  in a hole below the wall, and because in Italy you are pleased  with little things, we stopped to look at it, and watch it turn  round like a light-house lamp, now glowing clear as a star, now an  indistinguishable mass of phosphorescence. And all the time the sky  was growing lighter, and the mountains darker in the east.    It was the moon.    Slowly it rose. The Milky Way grew pale in the lake, and one great  star which had twinkled like a will-o'-the-wisp among the reeds  went out. The light grew and gathered behind the hills, and at last  the miracle of moonrise came to us as we waited in the scented  darkness of Thrasymene's shore, as it came to the young world on  the eve of its creation. First the rim, and then the pulsing globe  leaping from the shadows. For a moment it hung upon the hillside  while two fantastic stone-pines, a fraction of an inch in height,  swayed within its circle like neophytes bowing before Diana; then  it rose into the heavens,--a stately ship steering among the  stars.    [Illustration: LAKE THRASYMENE.]    A miracle no less because our darkness has been lightened thus  since the beginning of the world. There are so many miracles  every day, if we but knew them,--the scent of flowers, the webs  of spiders, the subtle fragrance of the earth, a wayside weed,  and, most beautiful of all, the sunrise and the moon. For sunsets,  though they may fill a grey world with rose and gold, and though  they are always so magnificent that words are pallid pictures and  artists' colours impotent, never have the beauty of the dawn. A  sunset may turn our joy to melancholy, so tender is it, so pregnant  with regret for the vanished day, so full of splendours. But we are  always happy in the dawn. What of the night? It is over and gone. A  new world lies at our feet; a new beauty fills our eyes; the breath  of the morning in our nostrils is as a flower after rain. For in  the dawn we step from the valley of the Shadow of Death on to the  rosy mountains of Hope.    And because you are in Italy you have time to notice these miracles  of every day, time to be happy, time to watch things grow. The  hours do not matter, for to-morrow is as yesterday, and to-day is  but a little minute in a garden. If it should rain the butterflies  will only seek their shelter, the cicalas will be still, and the  pores of the thirsty earth will open. To-morrow the sun will shine  again. Or the day after that.    Nor is Passignano devoid of interest for the sightseer whose  pleasure is not to be found in green pastures or beside still  waters. Magione, with its three mediaeval castles and its memory of  the Baglioni, is within a drive. Picturesque Castiglione del Lago  is well worth a visit. There is the island of St. Francis, with  its ruined convent, now the villeggiatura of an Italian nobleman,  and its exquisite views of Montepulciano. And lastly, there is  the battle-field where Hannibal, the 'furious youth' of Publius  Cornelius Scipio, defeated Flaminius, the maker of roads.    We did not go to Magione, but we let two old men of Passignano row  us to St. Francis' Island in their weather-beaten fishing-boats.
