The tactical method of envelopment demands great numerical superiority,  and on account of the extreme extension of front necessitated is apt to  become dangerous as perforce the center is left weak. Attempts to  envelop, with which the observer is confronted again and again when  considering the military movements of the Central Powers on the western  battle front, were revealed on the morning of September 3, 1914, in the  position occupied by the German forces, and, correspondingly, in the  arrangement of the allied armies.    The German right, on September 3, 1914, and September 4, 1914, at which  time it was nearest to its desired goal of Paris, held the banks of the  Marne from Epernay to the banks of the little tributary the Ourcq, which  runs into the Marne from the north. This extreme right comprised the  Second Corps and the Fourth Reserve Corps, encamped on the western bank  of the little stream the Ourcq; while the Fourth Corps was given the  honor of the tip of the right, being camped on the Marne at La  Ferte-sous-Jouarre, supported by the Third Corps, the Seventh Corps and  the Seventh Corps Reserve. The Ninth Cavalry Division occupied an  advanced position west of Crecy and the Second Cavalry Division occupied  an advanced position near the British army, north of Coulommiers. These  troops constituted the First German Army, under the command of General  von Kluck.    The Allies' left, confronting this position, held strong reserves, and  by the nature of the ground itself, was well placed to prevent any  enveloping movement, dear to the German school of military tactics. It  rested securely on the fortress of Paris, believed by its constructors  to be the most fully fortified city in the world, and should the German  right endeavor to encircle the left wing of the Allies, should it  develop a farther westerly movement, it would but come in contact with  the outer line of those defenses and thence be deflected in such an  enormous arc as to thin the line beyond the power of keeping it strong  enough to resist a piercing attack at all points. Clearly, then, as long  as the extreme left of the Allies remained in contact with the defenses  of Paris, an enveloping movement was not possible on the easterly flank.    Facing the German extreme right, was the Sixth French Army, one of the  great reserves of General Joffre, which had been steadily building up  since August 29, 1914, with its right on the Marne and its left at Betz,  in the Ourcq Valley, encamped on the western side of that stream, facing  the Second and Fourth Corps of the Germans. The strengthening of that  army from the forces at Paris was hourly, and while three or four days  before it had been felt that the Sixth French Army was too weak to be  placed in so vital a point--that it should have been supplemented with  the Ninth Army--the results justified the French generalissimo's plans  and more than justified his confidence in the British Army, or  Expeditionary Force, which faced the tip of the German right wing drive  and was encamped on a line from Villeneuve le Comte to Jouy le Chatel,  the center of the British army being at a point five miles southeast of  Coulommiers. This army was under the command of General Sir John French.    The right center of the German line was held by General von Buelow's  army, consisting of the Ninth Corps, the Tenth Corps, the Tenth Reserve  Corps, and the Guard Corps. This army also was encamped upon the Marne,  stretching from the eastern end of General Von Kluck's army as far as  Epernay. This army thus held the Forests of Vassy but was confronted by  the marshes of St. Gond.    Confronting this right center was, first of all, General Conneau's  Cavalry Corps, which was in touch with the right wing of the British  army under Sir John French. Then, holding the line from Esternay to  Courtacon lay the Fifth French Army under General d'Esperey. Full in  face of the strongest part of the German right center stood one of the  strongest of General Joffre's new reserves, the Ninth Army under General  Foch, with the marshes of St. Gond in front of him, and holding a  twenty-mile line from Esternay, past Sezanne to Camp de Mailly, a  remarkably well-equipped army, very eager for the fray.    The hastily replenished corps, largely of Saxons, which had been General  von Hausen's army, lay next to General von Buelow, a little north of  Vitry, and as it proved, a weak spot in the German line. The left center  of the attacking force was under the command of the Duke of Wuerttemberg  and extended across the whole southern end of the plain of Champagne to  the upper streams of the Aisne south of St. Menhould. The extreme left  of this advanced line was the army of the Imperial Crown Prince, holding  the old line on the Argonne to the south of Verdun. In close relation to  this advanced line, but not directly concerned with the battles of the  Marne, were the armies of the Bavarian Crown Prince, encamped in the  plateau of the Woevre, engaged largely in the task of holding open the  various lines of communication, while far to the south, in the vicinity  of the much battered little town of Mulhouse, lay the remains of the  decimated army of the Alsace campaigns under General von Heeringen.    Facing this left center came General Langle's Fourth French Army,  covering the southern side of the plain of Chalons, it lay south of  Vitry-le-Francois, and faced due north. On this army, it was expected,  the brunt of the drive would fall. At this point the French battle line  made a sharp angle, the Third French Army, commanded by General  Sarrail, occupying a base from Bar-le-Duc to Verdun. It thus faced  almost west, skirting the lower edge of the Forest of Argonne. At the  same time it was back to back with the Second French Army, which covered  the great barrier of forts from Verdun to Toul and Epinal, while the  First French Army held the line from Epinal to Belfort.          CHAPTER XIII    ALLIED AND GERMAN BATTLE PLANS      So much for the actual disposition of the armies. The question of  preponderance of numbers, of advantages of position, and of comparative  fighting efficiency is the next factor with which to be reckoned. The  numbers were fairly evenly matched. About twelve days before this  fateful day of September 3, 1914, there were approximately 100 German  divisions as against seventy-five French, British, and Belgian  divisions. But, during those twelve days, French and British  mobilization advanced with hectic speed, while, at the same time,  Germany was compelled to transfer ten or perhaps fifteen of her  divisions to the eastern theater of war. It follows, therefore, that  there were about 4,000,000 soldiers in all the armies that confronted  each other in the week of September 3-10, 1914, of whom, probably,  3,000,000 were combatants.    An early estimate placed the German strength at 1,300,000 combatants,  and the Allies at about 1,700,000. A later French estimate put the  Germans at 1,600,000, with the Allies between 1,400,000 and 1,500,000.  The preponderance of efficiency of equipment lay with the Germans.    The plans of the German campaign at this time, so far as they can be  determined from the official orders and from the manner in which the  respective movements were carried out, were three-fold. The first of  these movements was the order given to General von Kluck to swirl his  forces to the southeast of Paris, swerving away from the capital in an  attempt to cut the communications between it and the Fifth French Army  under General d'Esperey. This plan evidently involved a feint attack  upon the Sixth French Army under General Manoury (though General Pare  took charge of the larger issues of this western campaign), coupled with  a swift southerly stroke and an attack upon what was supposed to be the  exposed western flank of General d'Esperey's army. The cause of the  failure of this attempt was the presence of the British army, as has  been shown in the alignment of the armies given above, and as will be  shown in detail later, in the recital of the actual progress of the  fighting. Important as was this movement, however, it was the least of  the three elements in General von Moltke's plan for the shattering of  the great defense line of the Allies.    The second element in this plan was, contrary to Germany's usual  tactics, the determination to attack the center of the French line and  break through. Almost three-quarters of a million men were concentrated  on this point. The armies of General von Buelow, General Hausen and the  Duke of Wuerttemberg were massed in the center of the line. There,  however, General Foch's new Ninth Army was prepared to meet the attack.  It will be remembered that, in the disposition of the troops, these  respective armies were facing each other across the great desolate  plain, the ancient battle ground. If the German center could break  through the French center, and if at the same time General von Kluck,  commanding the German right, could execute a swift movement to the  southeast, the Fifth French Army would be between two fires, together  with such part of the Ninth Army as lay to the westward of the point to  be pierced. This strategic plan held high promise, and it would have  menaced the whole interior of France southward from the plain of  Champagne, but even this second part of the plan, important as it was,  does not appear to have been the crucial point in the campaign.    The glory of the victory, if indeed victory it should prove, as the  successes of the previous two weeks had led the Germans to believe, was  to be given to the crown prince. With a great deal of trouble and with  far more delay than had been anticipated, the crown prince's army had at  last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29349"],[0,"Creatures of the Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#19)"],[1," of vapour through the moonbeams falling  aslant from the illumined edges of an overhanging cloud, and through the  shadows stretching in long, irregular lines between the fallow and the  copse; and night after night the shadows near the copse grew deeper, and  still deeper, as the hawthorn leaf-buds opened to the warmth of spring.    The grass-spears lengthened; the moss spread in new, rain-jewelled  velvet-pile over the pasture floor; the woodbine and the bramble trailed  their tender shoots above the hedge; a leafy screen sheltered each  woodland home; and even the narrow path from the field-voles' burrow to  the corner of the copse led through a perfect bower of half-transparent  greenery. The birds were everywhere busy with their nests in the  thickets; sometimes, in the quiet evening, long after the moon had  risen and Kweek had ventured forth to feed, the robin and the thrush,  perched on a bare ash-tree, sang their sweet solos to the sleepy fields;  and, with the earliest peep of dawn, the clear, wild notes of the  missel-thrush rang out over the valley from the beech-tree near the  river. The rabbits extended their galleries and dug new \"breeding  earths\" in their warren by the wood; and often, in the deep stillness of  the night, the call-note of an awakened bird echoed, murmuring, among  the rocks opposite the pines far down the slope.    During the past few weeks great events had happened in the new-made  chamber of the field-voles' burrow. Hundreds of dry grass-bents,  bleached and seasoned by the winter frosts and rains, had been collected  there, with tufts of withered moss, a stray feather or two dropped from  the ruined nest of a long-tailed titmouse in the furze, and a few fine,  hair-like roots of polypody fern from the neighbouring thicket. And now,  their nursery complete, four tiny, hairless voles, with disproportionate  heads, round black eyes beneath unopened lids, wrinkled muzzles, and  abbreviated tails--helpless midgets in form suggestive of diminutive  bull-dog puppies--lay huddled in their tight, warm bed. It was a time of  great anxiety for Kweek. While his mate with maternal pride went  leisurely about her duties, doing all things in order, as if she had  nursed much larger families and foes were never known, he moved fussily  hither and thither, visiting his offspring at frequent intervals during  the night, creeping into the wood and back along his bowered path,  scampering noisily down the shaft if the brown owl but happened to hoot  far up in the glen, and doing a hundred things for which there was not  the slightest need, and which only served to irritate and alarm the  careful mother-vole.    Kweek inherited his timorous disposition from countless generations of  voles that by their ceaseless watchfulness, had survived when others had  been killed by birds and beasts of prey; and though, in his zeal for the  welfare of his family, he often gave a false alarm, it was far better  that he should be at all times prepared for the worst than that, in some  unguarded instant, death should drop swiftly from the sky or crawl  stealthily into his hidden home.    During spring, more frequently than at any other season, death waited  for him and his kindred--in the grass, in the air, in the trees along  the hedge-banks, and on the summit of the rock that towered above the  glen. Vermin had become unusually numerous in the valley, partly because  in the mild winter their food had been sufficient, and partly because  the keeper, feeble with old age, could no longer shoot and trap them  with the deadly certainty that had made him famous in his younger days.  Bold in the care of their young, the vermin ravaged the countryside,  preying everywhere on the weak and ailing little children of Nature. But  fate was indulgent to Kweek; though his kindred in the colony beyond the  wood, and the bank-voles in the sheltered hollow near the pines,  suffered greatly from all kinds of enemies, he and his mate still  managed to escape unhurt.    One night a fox, prowling across the pasture, caught sight of Kweek as  he hurried to his lair. Suspicious and crafty, Reynard paused at one of  the entrances to the burrow, thrust his sharp nose as far as possible  down the shaft, drew a long, deep breath, and commenced to dig away the  soil from the mouth of the hole. Suddenly changing his mind--perhaps  because the scent was faint and he concluded that his labour would not  be sufficiently repaid--he ceased his exertions and wandered off towards  the hedge. Next day a carrion crow, seeing the heap of earth that lay  around the hole, and shrewdly guessing it to mean a treat in store, flew  down from an oak-tree, and hopped sideways towards the spot. He peered  inquisitively at the opening, waddled over to another entrance,  returned, and listened eagerly. Convinced that a sound of breathing came  from midway between the two holes he had examined, he moved towards the  spot directly above the nest, tapped it sharply with his beak, and again  returned to listen near the entrance. But all his artifice was quite in  vain; the voles would not bolt; they were not even inquisitive; so  presently, baffled in his hopes of plunder, he moved clumsily away,  stooped for an instant, and lifted himself on slow, sable pinions into  the air.    The mother vole, assisted in questionable fashion by meddlesome Kweek,  spent several hours of the following night in repairing the damage done  by the fox. She drew most of the soil back into the shaft, and then,  where it accumulated in the passage beneath, made the opening towards  the inner chamber slightly narrower than before. Soon, moistened and  hardened by the constant \"traffic\" of tiny feet nearly always damp with  dew, the mound of earth formed a barrier so artfully contrived that even  a weasel might find it difficult to enter the gallery from the bottom of  the shaft.          III.    A BARREN HILLSIDE.      Living a secluded life in the pasture with his little mate, Kweek  escaped the close attention paid by the \"vermin\" to his kindred in the  colony beyond the wood. The brown owl still remembered where he dwelt,  but, loath to make a special nightly journey to the spot, seldom caused  him the least anxiety. She seemed to content herself with a strict watch  over the bank inhabited by the red voles, and over the fields on the far  side of the copse, where the grey voles, notwithstanding that they  supplied her with many a delicious supper, were becoming numerous. She  awaited an almost certain increase among the \"small deer\" of the  pasture, before commencing her raids on the grey voles there. As events  proved, however, her patience was unrewarded.    Kweek's first experience in rearing a family ended disastrously. Two of  the nurslings died a few hours after birth; one, venturing from the nest  too soon in the evening, was killed by a magpie; and two, while sitting  out near the hedge, were trampled to death by a flock of sheep rushing,  panic-stricken, at the sight of a wandering fox. By the middle of May,  when another vole family of six had arrived, the number of vermin in the  valley had perceptibly diminished. The old, asthmatic keeper in charge  of the Cerdyn valley died, and a younger and more energetic man from a  neighbouring estate came to take his place. Eager to gain the favour of  his master by providing him good sport in the coming autumn, the new  keeper ranged the woods from dawn till dusk, setting pole-traps in the  trees, or baiting rabbit-traps in the \"creeps\" of stoat or weasel, and  destroying nests, as well as shooting any furred or feathered creature  of questionable character. The big brown owl from the beech-grove, the  kestrel from the rock on the far side of the brook, the sparrow-hawk  from the spinney up-stream, together with the weasels, the stoats, the  cats, the jays, and the magpies--all in turn met their doom.    A pair of barn-owls from the loft in the farm suffered next. These owls  were great pets at the old homestead. For many years they had lived  unmolested in their gloomy retreat under the tiles, and regularly at  nightfall had flown fearlessly to and fro among the outbuildings, or  perched on the ruined pigeon-cote watching for the rats to leave their  holes.    The farmer, less ignorant than the keeper, recognised the owls as  friends, and treated them accordingly. They were his winged cats, and  assisted to check the increase of a plague. Like the brown owl, they  knew well the habits of the voles; but their attention was diverted by  the rats and the mice at the farm, and they seldom wandered far afield  except for a change of diet or to stretch wings cramped by a long summer  day's seclusion. The rats, however, were far from being exterminated;  and so, when a little child who was all sunshine to his parents in the  lonely homestead died from typhoid fever, the village doctor, fearing an  epidemic, advised that the pests should be utterly destroyed. Loath to  use strychnine, since he knew that in a neighbouring valley some owls  had died from eating poisoned rats, the farmer sought the aid of the  village poachers, who, with their terriers and ferrets, thoroughly  searched the stacks and the buildings. During the hunt it was noticed  that about a score of rats took refuge in a narrow chamber under the  eaves. The farmer, directing operations in another part of the yard, was  unaware of what had occurred. The poachers, knowing nothing of the  presence of the owls, pushed a terrier through the opening beneath the  rafters of the loft, and blocked the hole with the rusty blade of a  disused shovel. For a few moments the quick patter of tiny feet  indicated that the terrier was busily engaged with his task; then cries  of rage and terror came from the imprisoned dog, while with these cries  were mingled the sounds of flapping wings. When at last the poachers  unstopped the hole and dragged the terrier out, they found that"]]]
