A stream of sea water  drove against his feet through the open valve, and he reached for the  valve to close it. The force of the water held it open for a moment, but  he threw every ounce of his strength into the effort. The valve slowly  closed.    It was beyond his strength to haul the heavy Doctor with his pressure  diving suit through the restricted confines of the inner door, so Carnes  wormed his way into the lock and with trembling fingers unscrewed the  helmet of the Doctor's diving suit. The helmet clanged to the floor and  Carnes scooped up his hands full of water and dashed it into the  Doctor's face. There was no response and he was at his wit's end. He  sprang for the radio to order the sphere hauled up when his glance fell  on the oxygen tank. It took him only a moment to connect a rubber hose  to the tank, and in a few seconds a blast of the life-giving gas was  blowing into the scientist's face. Dr. Bird gave a convulsive gasp or  two and opened his eyes.    \"Shut off the juice, Carnes,\" he said faintly. \"Too much of that's  bad.\"    Carnes shut off the oxygen and Dr. Bird struggled to a sitting position  and inhaled deep breaths.    \"That was a narrow squeak, old dear,\" he said faintly. \"Give me a hand  and I'll climb in.\"           *       *       *       *       *    With the detective's aid he climbed into the sphere and Carnes fastened  the inner door. Slowly the Doctor rid himself of the diving suit and lay  prone on the floor, his breath still coming in gasps.    \"Thanks for your warning about the time, Carnes,\" he said. \"I knew that  my air supply was running short but I was caught down there and couldn't  readily free myself. I thought for a while that my time had come, but it  wasn't so written. By the looks of things, I freed myself just in  time.\"    \"Did you find out anything?\" asked the detective eagerly.    \"I did,\" replied Dr. Bird grimly. \"For one thing, the gold is no longer  in the hold of the _Arethusa_.\"    \"It's gone?\"    \"Clean as a whistle, every bar of it. A hole has been cut in the vault  around the combination, and the bars slid back and the door opened. The  gold has been stolen.\"    \"Might it not have been stolen before the vessel sank?\"    \"The idea occurred to me of course, and I examined things pretty  carefully. I know that the theft occurred after the vessel sank.\"    \"How could you tell?\"    \"For one thing, the hole was cut with an under-water cutting torch. For  the second, look here.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Doctor rolled up his trousers and showed the detective his leg.  Carnes cried out as he saw huge purple welts on it.    \"What caused that?\" he cried.    \"As I entered the vault, I stepped full into a steel bear trap which was  set there for the purpose of catching and holding anyone who entered.  Someone has visited the _Arethusa_, since she sank, and looted her, and  also arranged so that any diver who got as far as the vault would never  return to the surface to tell of it. Luckily for myself, I carried a  heavy wrench and was able to free myself. Most divers don't carry such a  thing.\"    \"But who could have done it?\"    \"That's what we have got to find out, and we aren't going to do it down  here. Give the word to have us hauled up; and, Carnes, don't mention  anything about the looting of the vessel. Allow it to be understood that  I couldn't get into the hold. We'll head back for New York at once. I  want to have a few small changes made in this sphere before we use it  again. While I am doing that, I want you to get hold of the Coast Guard  or the Immigration Service or whoever it is that has the complete  records in that case of alien smuggling, by the Young Labor party. When  you get the information, report to me and we'll go over it. You might  also drop a hint to Captain Starley that will stop all further attempts  at salvage operations for a few days. Tell him that I'll arrange to have  a Coast Guard cutter guard the locality of the wreck.\"    \"Won't that be rather risky for the cutter?\"    \"I think not. The gold is gone and there is no reason to apprehend any  further danger in that locality, at least for the present.\"           *       *       *       *       *    At nine o'clock next morning Carnes and Dr. Bird sat in the office of  Lieutenant Commander Minden of the United States Coast Guard, listening  intently to the history of the alien smuggling case. Commander Minden  was saying:    \"Their boats would load up and clear ostensibly for Rio de Janeiro or  some other South American port, but once they were in the Atlantic, they  would alter their course and head from the Massachusetts coast. Of  course, we had no right to interfere with them on the high seas, and  they never came closer than fifty miles of our coast line. When they got  that close, they would cruise slowly back and forth for a few days and  then steam away south to the port they had cleared for. When they got  there, of course there were no passengers on board.    \"We patrolled the coast carefully while they were around but we never  got any indication of any landing of aliens and yet we knew they were  being landed in some way. We drew lines so close that a cork couldn't  get by without being seen and we even had the air patrolled, but with no  results. Eventually the air patrol was the thing that gave them away.    \"They had been operating so successfully that they evidently got  careless and started a load off late in the night so they didn't reach  the coast by dawn. A Navy plane was flying along the coast-line about  twelve miles off when they spotted a submarine running parallel with the  coast, headed north. It didn't look like an American craft and they went  on and radioed Washington and found that we had no under-sea craft in  that neighborhood. They returned to their patrol and followed the sub  for a matter of thirty or forty miles up the coast, and then it turned  in right toward the shore. The shore line there is rocky, and, at the  point where the sub was heading, it falls sheer about two hundred  fathoms. The sub ran right at the cliff and disappeared from view.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Lieutenant Commander Minden paused impressively. Carnes and Dr. Bird set  forward in their chairs, for it was evident that the crux of the story  was at hand.    \"When the plane reported what they had seen, we knew how those aliens  were being landed. The point where the sub went in gave us a good idea  of the location of their base and we threw a cordon of men around and  searched. A Navy sub was sent to the scene and they reported that there  was a tunnel opening into the rock, about a hundred fathoms under water,  running for they had no idea how far under the land. They stayed to  guard the hole while we combed the land. It took us a week to locate the  place, but we traced some truck loads of food and finally found it. This  tunnel ran under the land for a mile and then ended in a large cave  underground. The Young Labor party had established a regular receiving  depot there, and took the aliens from the sub and kept them for a day or  two until they had a chance to load them into trucks and run them into  Boston or some other town in the night.    \"Once we had the place spotted, we sent a gang in and captured the whole  works without any trouble. The underground cavern had no natural opening  to the surface, but one had been made by blasting. We captured the  whole lot and then sealed the end of the hole with rock and concrete.  That was the end of the affair.\"    \"Thank you, Commander; you have given us a very graphic description of  it. I suppose you could find the entrance which was sealed up?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Easily. I led the raiding party. I forgot to mention one blunder we  made. Evidently some word of our plans leaked out, for the sub which was  guarding the outer end of the tunnel was called away by a radio message  supposed to be from the Navy Department. It had gone only a short  distance, however, when the commander smelled a rat and made his way  back. He was too late. He was just in time to see the sub emerge from  the hole and head into the open sea. He gave chase, but the other sub  was faster than the Navy boat and it got clear away. The leader of the  gang must have been on it, for we didn't get him.\"    \"Who was the leader?\"    \"From some records we captured, his name was Ivan Saranoff. I never saw  him.\"    \"Saranoff?\" said Dr. Bird thoughtfully. \"The name seems familiar. Where  have I--Thunder! I know now. He was at one time a member of the faculty  of St. Petersburg. He was one of the leading biologists of his time.  Carnes, we've found our man.\"    \"If you are thinking of Saranoff, I am afraid you are mistaken, Doctor,\"  said Commander Minden. \"Neither he nor his submarine have ever been  heard of since and it has been generally conceded that they were lost at  sea. We had some pretty rough weather just after that affair.\"    \"Rough weather doesn't mean much to a sub, Commander. I expect that he's  our man. At any rate, the place we want to go is the end of that  tunnel.\"    \"I'm at your service, Doctor.\"    \"Carnes, get the location of that tunnel entrance from Commander Minden  and order the _Minneconsin_ to proceed north along the coast to that  vicinity and stand by for radio orders. I am going to telephone Mitchell  Field and get a plane. We have no time to lose.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The plane from Mitchell Field roared down to a landing, and Carnes, Dr.  Bird and Commander Minden dismounted from the rear cockpit and looked  around. They had landed in a smooth field at the base of a rise almost  rugged enough to be called a mountain. A group of three men were  standing near them as they got out of the plane. One of the men  approached.    \"Dr. Bird?\" asked the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],[0,"Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#19)"],[1,"he had gone out to race when, to use William's own words, it was  a blue duck for Bill's chance of keeping afloat; and every time did the  gallant race pony pull his owner through.    Bill owed more to Sausage II. than he owed to his creditors.    Brought up as a pet, the little animal was absolutely trustworthy. He  would carry a lady or a child, or pull a sulky; in fact, it was quite  a common thing for Blinky Bill to drive him in a sulky to a country  meeting and look about him for a likely \"mark\". If he could find a fleet  youth with a reputedly fast pony, Bill would offer to \"pull the little  cuddy out of the sulky and run yer for a fiver.\" Sometimes he got  beaten; but as he never paid, that didn't matter. He did not believe in  fighting; but he would always sooner fight than pay.    But all these devices had left him on his uppers in the end. He had  no feed for his ponies, and no money to buy it; the corn merchant had  written his account off as bad, and had no desire to make it worse.  Under the circumstances, what was he to do? Sausage II. must be sold.    With heavy heart Bill led the pony down to be inspected. He saw Mr.  Algernon de Montgomery Smythers, and measured him with his eye. He saw  it would be no use to talk about racing to him, so he went on the other  track.    He told him that the pony belonged to a Methodist clergyman, who used to  drive him in a \"shay\". There are no shays in this country; but Bill had  read the word somewhere, and thought it sounded respectable. \"Yus, sir,\"  he said, \"'e goes lovely in a shay,\" and he was just starting off at  twenty words a second, when he was stopped.    Mr. A. de M. Smythers was brusque with his inferiors, and in this he  made a mistake. Instead of listening to all that Blinky Bill said, and  disbelieving it at his leisure, he stopped his talk.    \"If you want to sell this pony, dry up,\" he said. \"I don't believe a  word you say, and it only worries me to hear you lying.\"    Fatal mistake! You should never stop a horse-dealer's talk. And call him  anything you like, but never say you doubt his word.    Both these things Mr. Smythers did; and, though he bought the pony at a  high price, yet the insult sank deep into the heart of Blinky Bill.    As the capitalist departed leading the pony, Blinky Bill muttered to  himself, \"Ha! ha! Little does he know that he is leading Sausage II.,  the greatest 13.2 pony of the century. Let him beware how he gets  alongside anything. That's all! Blinky Bill may yet be revenged!\"          Chapter III.--EXIT ALGY      Christmas Day came. Algy's father gave orders to have the pony saddled,  and led round to the front door. Algy's mother, a lady of forty summers,  spent the morning superintending the dinner. Dinner was the principal  event in the day with her. Alas, poor lady! Everything she ate agreed  with her, and she got fatter and fatter and fatter.    The cold world never fully appreciates the struggles of those who  are fat--the efforts at starvation, the detested exercise, the long,  miserable walks. Well has one of our greatest poets written, \"Take up  the fat man's burden.\" But we digress.    When Algy saw the pony he shouted with delight, and in half a minute was  riding him up and down the front drive. Then he asked for leave to go  out in the street--and that was where the trouble began.    Up and down the street the pony cantered, as quietly as possible, till  suddenly round a corner came two butcher boys racing their horses. With  a clatter of clumsy hoofs they thundered past. In half a second there  was a rattle, and a sort of comet-like rush through the air. Sausage II.  was off after them with his precious burden.    The family dog tried to keep up with him, and succeeded in keeping ahead  for about three strides. Then, like the wolves that pursued Mazeppa, he  was left yelping far behind. Through Surry Hills and Redfern swept the  flying pony, his rider lying out on his neck in Tod Sloan fashion, while  the ground seemed to race beneath him. The events of the way were just  one hopeless blur till the pony ran straight as an arrow into the yard  of Blinky Bill.          Chapter IV.--RUNNING THE RULE      As soon as Blinky Bill recognised his visitor, he was delighted.    \"You here,\" he said, \"Ha, ha, revenge is mine! I'll get a tidy reward  for taking you back, my young shaver.\"    Then from the unresisting child he took a gold watch and three  sovereigns. These he said he would put in a safe place for him, till he  was going home again. He expected to get at least a tenner ready money  for bringing Algy back, and hoped that he might be allowed to keep the  watch into the bargain.    With a light heart he went down town with Algy's watch and sovereigns in  his pocket. He did not return till daylight, when he awoke his wife with  bad news.    \"Can't give the boy up,\" he said. \"I moskenoed his block and tackle, and  blued it in the school.\" In other words, he had pawned the boy's watch  and chain, and had lost the proceeds at pitch and toss.    \"Nothing for it but to move,\" he said, \"and take the kid with us.\"    So move they did.    The reader can imagine with what frantic anxiety the father and mother  of little Algy sought for their lost one. They put the matter into the  hands of the detective police, and waited for the Sherlock Holmeses of  the force to get in their fine work. There was nothing doing.    Years rolled on, and the mysterious disappearance of little Algy was yet  unsolved. The horse-dealer's revenge was complete.    The boy's mother consulted a clairvoyant, who murmured mystically \"What  went by the ponies, will come by the ponies;\" and with that they had to  remain satisfied.          Chapter V.--THE TRICKS OF THE TURF      It was race day at Pulling'em Park, and the ponies were doing their  usual performances.    Among the throng the heaviest punter is a fat lady with diamond  earrings. Does the reader recognize her? It is little Algy's mother.  Her husband is dead, leaving her the whole of his colossal fortune, and,  having developed a taste for gambling, she is now engaged in \"doing it  in on the ponies\". She is one of the biggest bettors in the game.    When women take to betting they are worse than men.    But it is not for betting alone that she attends the meetings. She  remembers the clairvoyant's \"What went by the ponies will come by the  ponies.\" And always she searches in the ranks of the talent for her lost  Algy.    Here enters another of our dramatis personae--Blinky Bill, prosperous  once more. He has got a string of ponies and punters together. The  first are not much use to a man without the second; but, in spite of all  temptations, Bill has always declined to number among his punters the  mother of the child he stole. But the poor lady regularly punts on his  ponies, and just as regularly is \"sent up\"--in other words, loses her  money.    To-day she has backed Blinky's pair, Nostrils and Tin Can, for the  double. Nostrils has won his race, and Tin Can, if on the job, can  win the second half of the double. Is he on the job? The prices are  lengthening against him, and the poor lady recognises that once more she  is \"in the cart\".    Just then she meets Tin Can's jockey, Dodger Smith, face to face. A  piercing scream rends the atmosphere, as if a thousand school children  drew a thousand slate pencils down a thousand slates simultaneously. \"Me  cheild! Me cheild! Me long-lost Algy!\"    It did not take long to convince Algy that he would be better off as a  son to a wealthy lady than as a jockey, subject to the fiendish caprices  of Blinky Bill.    \"All right, mother,\" he said. \"Put all you can raise on Tin Can. I'm  going to send Blinky up. It's time I had a cut on me own, anyway.\"    The horses went to the post. Tons of money were at the last moment  hurled on to Tin Can. The books, knowing he was \"dead\", responded  gamely, and wrote his name till their wrists gave out. Blinky Bill had  a half-share in all the bookies' winnings, so he chuckled grimly as he  went to the rails to watch the race.    They're off. And what is this that flashes to the front, while the howls  of the bookies rise like the yelping of fiends in torment? It is Dodger  Smith on Tin Can, and from the grandstand there is a shrill feminine  yell of triumph as the gallant pony sails past the post.    The bookies thought that Blinky Bill had sold them, and they discarded  him for ever.    Algy and his mother were united, and backed horses together happily ever  after, and sometimes out in the back yard of their palatial mansion  they hand the empty bottles, free of charge, to a poor old broken-down  bottle-O, called Blinky Bill."]]]
