It is the only time I have been to  Versailles. The contrary might be supposed; for I have allowed it to be  understood that I have often seen Madame de Lamotte since she left my  house, and was acquainted with all her actions, and that the former  confidence and friendship still existed between us. In allowing this, I  have acted a lie, and transgressed the habitual sincerity of my whole  life.\"    This assertion produced a bad impression on the magistrate. Derues  perceived it, and to avert evil consequences, hastened to add--    \"My conduct can only be appreciated when it is known in entirety. I  misunderstood the meaning of Madame de Lamotte's letter. She asked me to  send her her son, I thought to oblige her by accompanying him, and not  leaving him to go alone. So we travelled together, and arrived at  Versailles about midday. As I got down from the coach I saw Madame de  Lamotte at the palace gate, and observed, to my astonishment, that my  presence displeased her. She was not alone.\"    He stopped, although he had evidently reached the most interesting point  of his story.    \"Go on,\" said the magistrate; \"why do you stop now?\"    \"Because what I have to say is so painful--not to me, who have to  justify myself, but for others, that I hesitate.\"    \"Go on.\"    \"Will you then interrogate me, please?\"    \"Well, what happened in this interview?\"    Derues appeared to collect himself for a moment, and then said with the  air of a man who has decide on speaking out at last--    \"Madame de Lamotte was not alone; she was attended by a gentleman whom I  did not know, whom I never saw either at Buisson-Souef or in Paris, and  whom I have never seen again since. I will ask you to allow me to  recount everything; even to the smallest details. This man's face struck  me at once, on account of a singular resemblance; he paid no attention  to me at first, and I was able to examine him at leisure. His manners  were those of a man belonging to the highest classes of society, and his  dress indicated wealth. On seeing Edouard, he said to Madame de  Lamotte--    \"'So this is he?' and he then kissed him tenderly. This and the marks of  undisguised pleasure which he evinced surprised me, and I looked at  Madame de Lamotte, who then remarked with some asperity--    \"'I did not expect to see you, Monsieur Derues. I had not asked you to  accompany my son.'    \"Edouard seemed quite as much surprised as I was. The stranger gave me a  look of haughty annoyance, but seeing I did not avoid his glance his  countenance assumed a more gentle expression, and Madame de Lamotte  introduced him as a person who took great interest in Edouard.\"    \"It is a whole tissue of imposture!\" exclaimed Monsieur de Lamotte.    \"Allow me to finish,\" answered Derues. \"I understand your doubts, and  that you are not anxious to believe what I say, but I have been brought  here by legal summons to tell the truth, and I am going to tell it. You  can then weigh the two accusations in the balance, and choose between  them. The reputation of an honourable man is as sacred, as important, as  worthy of credit as the reputation of a woman, and I never heard that  the virtue of the one was more fragile than that of the other.\"    Monsieur de Lamotte, thunderstruck by such a revelation, could not  contain his impatience and indignation.    \"This, then,\" he said, \"is the explanation of an anonymous letter which  I received, and of the injurious suggestions' concerning my wife's  honour which it contained; it was written to give an appearance of  probability to this infamous legend. The whole thing is a disgraceful  plot, and no doubt Monsieur Derues wrote the letter himself.\"    \"I know nothing about it,\" said Derues unconcernedly, \"and the  explanation which you profess to find in it I should rather refer to  something else I am going to mention. I did not know a secret warning  had been sent to you: I now learn it from you, and I understand  perfectly that such a letter, may have been written. But that you have  received such a warning ought surely to be a reason for listening  patiently and not denouncing all I say as imposture.\"    While saying this Derues mentally constructed the fresh falsehood  necessitated by the interruption, but no variation of countenance  betrayed his thought. He had an air of dignity natural to his position.  He saw that, in spite of clear-headedness and long practice in studying  the most deceptive countenances, the magistrate so far had not scented  any of his falsehoods, and was getting bewildered in the windings of  this long narrative, through which Derues led him as he chose; and he  resumed with confidence--    \"You know that I made Monsieur de Lamotte's acquaintance more than a  year ago, and I had reason to believe his friendship as sincere as my  own. As a friend, I could not calmly accept the suspicion which then  entered my mind, nor could I conceal my surprise. Madame de Lamotte saw  this, and understood from my looks that I was not satisfied with the  explanation she wished me to accept. A glance of intelligence passed  between her and her friend, who was still holding Edouard's hand. The  day, though cold, was fine, and she proposed a walk in the park. I  offered her my arm, and the stranger walked in front with Edouard. We  had a short conversation, which has remained indelibly fixed in my  memory.    \"'Why did you come?' she inquired.    \"I did not answer, but looked sternly at her, in order to discompose  her. At length I said--    \"'You should have written, madame, and warned me that my coming would be  indiscreet.'    \"She seemed much disconcerted, and exclaimed--    \"'I am lost! I see you guess everything, and will tell my husband. I am  an unhappy woman, and a sin once committed can never be erased from the  pages of a woman's life! Listen, Monsieur Derues, listen, I implore you!  You see this man, I shall not tell you who he is, I shall not give his  name . . . but I loved him long ago; I should have been his wife, and  had he not been compelled to leave France, I should have married no one  else.'\"    Monsieur de Lamotte started, and grew pale.    \"What is the matter?\" the magistrate inquired.    \"Oh! this dastardly wretch is profiting by his knowledge of secrets  which a long intimacy has enabled him to discover. Do not believe him, I  entreat you, do not believe him!\"    Derues resumed. \"Madame de Lamotte continued: 'I saw him again sixteen  years ago, always in hiding, always proscribed. To-day he reappears  under a name which is not his own: he wishes to link my fate with his;  he has insisted on seeing Edouard. But I shall escape him. I have  invented this fiction of placing my son among the, royal pages to  account for my stay here. Do not contradict me, but help me; for a  little time ago I met one of Monsieur de Lamotte's friends, I am afraid  he suspected something. Say you have seen me several times; as you have  come, let it be known that you brought Edouard here. I shall return to  Buisson as soon as possible, but will you go first, see my husband,  satisfy him if he is anxious? I am in your hands; my honour, my  reputation, my very life, are at your mercy; you can either ruin or help  to save me. I may be guilty, but I am not corrupt. I have wept for my  sin day after day, and I have already cruelly expiated it.'\"    This execrable calumny was not related without frequent interruptions on  the part of Monsieur de Lamotte. He was, however, obliged to own to  himself that it was quite true that Marie Perier had really been  promised to a man whom an unlucky affair had driven into exile, and whom  he had supposed to be dead. This revelation, coming from Derues, who had  the strongest interest in lying, by no means convinced him of his wife's  dishonour, nor destroyed the feelings of a husband and father; but  Derues was not speaking for him lone, and what appeared incredible to  Monsieur de Lamotte might easily seem less improbable to the colder and  less interested judgment of the magistrate.    \"I was wrong,\" Derues continued, \"in allowing myself to be touched by  her tears, wrong in believing in her repentance, more wrong still in  going to Buisson to satisfy her husband. But I only consented on  conditions: Madame de Lamotte promised me to return shortly to Paris,  vowing that her son should never know the truth, and that the rest of  her life should be devoted to atoning for her sin by a boundless  devotion. She then begged me to leave her, and told me she would write  to me at Paris to fix the day of her return. This is what happened, and  this is why I went to Buissan and gave my support to a lying fiction.  With one word I might have destroyed the happiness of seventeen years. I  did not wish to do so. I believed in the remorse; I believe in it still,  in spite of all appearances; I have refused to speak this very day, and  made every effort to prolong an illusion which I know it will be  terrible to lose.\"    There was a moment of silence. This fable, so atrociously ingenious, was  simply and impressively narrated, and with an air of candour well  contrived to impose on the magistrate, or, at least, to suggest grave  doubts to his mind. Derues, with his usual cunning, had conformed his  language to the quality of his listener. Any tricks, profession of  piety, quotations from sacred books, so largely indulged in when he  wished to bamboozle people of a lower class, would here have told  against him. He knew when to abstain, and carried the art of deception  far enough to be able to lay aside the appearance of hypocrisy. He had  described all the circumstances without affectation, and if this  unexpected accusation was wholly unproved, it yet rested on a possible  fact, and did not appear absolutely incredible. The magistrate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#19)"],[1," death. Murmurs arose against this barbarous rule, and all men's  thoughts turned towards their fugitive queen. The Neapolitan barons had  taken the oath of fidelity with no willing hearts; and when it came to  the turn of the Counts of San Severino, they feared a trick of some  kind, and refused to appear all together before the Hungarian, but took  refuge in the town of Salerno, and sent Archbishop Roger, their brother,  to make sure of the king's intentions beforehand. Louis received him  magnificently, and appointed him privy councillor and grand proto  notary. Then, and not till then, did Robert of San Severino and Roger,  Count of Chiaramonte, venture into the king's presence; after doing  homage, they retired to their homes. The other barons followed their  example of caution, and hiding their discontent under a show of respect,  awaited a favourable moment for shaking off the foreign yoke. But the  queen had encountered no obstacle in her flight, and arrived at Nice  five days later. Her passage through Provence was like a triumph. Her  beauty, youth, and misfortunes, even certain mysterious reports as to  her adventures, all contributed to arouse the interest of the Provencal  people. Games and fetes were improvised to soften the hardship of exile  for the proscribed princess; but amid the outbursts of joy from every  town, castle, and city, Joan, always sad, lived ever in her silent grief  and glowing memories.    At the gates of Aix she found the clergy, the nobility, and the chief  magistrates, who received her respectfully but with no signs of  enthusiasm. As the queen advanced, her astonishment increased as she saw  the coldness of the people and the solemn, constrained air of the great  men who escorted her. Many anxious thoughts alarmed her, and she even  went so far as to fear some intrigue of the King of Hungary. Scarcely  had her cortege arrived at Castle Arnaud, when the nobles, dividing into  two ranks, let the queen pass with her counsellor Spinelli and two  women; then closing up, they cut her off from the rest of her suite.  After this, each in turn took up his station as guardian of the  fortress.    There was no room for doubt: the queen was a prisoner; but the cause of  the manoeuvre it was impossible to guess. She asked the high  dignitaries, and they, protesting respectful devotion, refused to  explain till they had news from Avignon. Meanwhile all honours that a  queen could receive were lavished on Joan; but she was kept in sight and  forbidden to go out. This new trouble increased her depression: she did  not know what had happened to Louis of Tarentum, and her imagination,  always apt at creating disasters, instantly suggested that she would  soon be weeping for his loss.    But Louis, always with his faithful Acciajuoli, had after many fatiguing  adventures been shipwrecked at the port of Pisa; thence he had taken  route for Florence, to beg men and money; but the Florentines decided to  keep an absolute neutrality, and refused to receive him. The prince,  losing his last hope, was pondering gloomy plans, when Nicholas  Acciajuoli thus resolutely addressed him:    \"My lord, it is not given to mankind to enjoy prosperity for ever: there  are misfortunes beyond all human foresight. You were once rich and  powerful, and you are now a fugitive in disguise, begging the help of  others. You must reserve your strength for better days. I still have a  considerable fortune, and also have relations and friends whose wealth  is at my disposal: let us try to make our way to the queen, and at once  decide what we can do. I myself shall always defend you and obey you as  my lord and master.\"    The prince received these generous offers with the utmost gratitude, and  told his counsellor that he placed his person in his hands and all that  remained of his future. Acciajuoli, not content with serving his master  as a devoted servant, persuaded his brother Angelo, Archbishop of  Florence, who was in great favour at Clement VI's court, to join with  them in persuading the pope to interest himself in the cause of Louis of  Tarentum. So, without further delay, the prince, his counsellor, and the  good prelate made their way to the port of Marseilles, but learning that  the queen was a prisoner at Aix, they embarked at Acque-Morte, and went  straight to Avignon. It soon appeared that the pope had a real affection  and esteem for the character of the Archbishop of Florence, for Louis  was received with paternal kindness at the court of Avignon; which was  far more than he had expected: when he kneeled before the sovereign  pontiff, His Holiness bent affectionately towards him and helped him to  rise, saluting him by the title of king.    Two days later, another prelate, the Archbishop of Aix, came into the  queen's presence,--    \"Most gracious and dearly beloved sovereign, permit the most humble and  devoted of your servants to ask pardon, in the name of your subjects,  for the painful but necessary measure they have thought fit to take  concerning your Majesty. When you arrived on our coast, your loyal town  of Aix had learned from a trustworthy source that the King of France was  proposing to give our country to one of his own sons, making good this  loss to you by the cession of another domain, also that the Duke of  Normandy had come to Avignon to request this exchange in person. We were  quite decided, madam, and had made a vow to God that we would give up  everything rather than suffer the hateful tyranny of the French. But  before spilling blood we thought it best to secure your august person as  a sacred hostage, a sacred ark which no man dared touch but was smitten  to the ground, which indeed must keep away from our walls the scourge of  war. We have now read the formal annulment of this hateful plan, in a  brief sent by the sovereign pontiff from Avignon; and in this brief he  himself guarantees your good faith.    \"We give you your full and entire liberty, and henceforth we shall only  endeavour to keep you among us by prayers and protestations. Go then,  madam, if that is your pleasure, but before you leave these lands, which  will be plunged into mourning by your withdrawal, leave with us some  hope that you forgive the apparent violence to which we have subjected  you, only in the fear that we might lose you; and remember that on the  day when you cease to be our queen you sign the death-warrant of all  your subjects.\"    Joan reassured the archbishop and the deputation from her good town of  Aix with a melancholy smile, and promised that she would always cherish  the memory of their affection. For this time she could not be deceived  as to the real sentiments of the nobles and people; and a fidelity so  uncommon, revealed with sincere tears, touched her heart and made her  reflect bitterly upon her past. But a league's distance from Avignon a  magnificent triumphal reception awaited her. Louis of Tarentum and all  the cardinals present at the court had come out to meet her. Pages in  dazzling dress carried above Joan's head a canopy of scarlet velvet,  ornamented with fleur-de-lys in gold and plumes. Handsome youths and  lovely girls, their heads crowned with flowers, went before her singing  her praise. The streets were bordered with a living hedge of people; the  houses were decked out; the bells rang a triple peal, as at the great  Church festivals. Clement VI first received the queen at the castle of  Avignon with all the pomp he knew so well how to employ on solemn  occasions, then she was lodged in the palace of Cardinal Napoleon of the  Orsini, who on his return from the Conclave at Perugia had built this  regal dwelling at Villeneuve, inhabited later by the popes.    No words could give an idea of the strangely disturbed condition of  Avignon at this period. Since Clement V had transported the seat of the  papacy to Provence, there had sprung up, in this rival to Rome, squares,  churches, cardinals' palaces, of unparalleled splendour. All the  business of nations and kings was transacted at the castle of Avignon.  Ambassadors from every court, merchants of every nation, adventurers of  all kinds, Italians, Spaniards, Hungarians, Arabs, Jews, soldiers,  Bohemians, jesters, poets, monks, courtesans, swarmed and clustered  here, and hustled one another in the streets. There was confusion of  tongues, customs, and costumes, an inextricable mixture of splendour and  rags, riches and misery, debasement and grandeur. The austere poets of  the Middle Ages stigmatised the accursed city in their writings under  the name of the New Babylon.    There is one curious monument of Joan's sojourn at Avignon and the  exercise of her authority as sovereign. She was indignant at the  effrontery of the women of the town, who elbowed everybody shamelessly  in the streets, and published a notable edict, the first of its kind,  which has since served as a model in like cases, to compel all  unfortunate women who trafficked in their honour to live shut up  together in a house, that was bound to be open every day in the year  except the last three days of Holy Week, the entrance to be barred to  Jews at all times. An abbess, chosen once a year, had the supreme  control over this strange convent. Rules were established for the  maintenance of order, and severe penalties inflicted for any  infringement of discipline. The lawyers of the period gained a great  reputation by this salutary institution; the fair ladies of Avignon were  eager in their defence of the queen in spite of the calumnious reports  that strove to tarnish her reputation: with one voice the wisdom of  Andre's widow was extolled. The concert of praises was disturbed,  however, by murmurs from the recluses themselves, who, in their own  brutal language, declared that Joan of Naples was impeding their  commerce so as to get a monopoly for herself.    Meanwhile Marie of Durazzo had joined her sister. After her husband's  death she had"]]]
