Congress did not receive the new Constitution enthusiastically, yet  after a few days' discussion it unanimously voted, eleven States being  present, that the recommendations of the Convention should be followed,  and accordingly sent the document to the States, but without a word of  approval or disapproval. On the whole the document was well received,  especially as it was favored by the upper class, who had the ability and  the opportunity for expression and were in a position to make themselves  heard. For a time it looked as if the Constitution would be readily  adopted.    The contest over the Constitution in the States is usually taken as  marking the beginning of the two great national political parties in  the United States. This was, indeed, in a way the first great national  question that could cause such a division. There had been, to be sure,  Whigs and Tories in America, reproducing British parties, but when the  trouble with the mother country began, the successive congresses of  delegates were recognized and attended only by the so-called American  Whigs, and after the Declaration of Independence the name of Tory,  became a reproach, so that with the end of the war the Tory party  disappeared. After the Revolution there were local parties in the  various States, divided on one and another question, such as that of  hard and soft money, and these issues had coincided in different  States; but they were in no sense national parties with organizations,  platforms, and leaders; they were purely local, and the followers of one  or the other would have denied that they were anything else than Whigs.  But a new issue was now raised. The Whig party split in two, new  leaders appeared, and the elements gathered in two main divisions--the  Federalists advocating, and the Anti-Federalists opposing, the adoption  of the new Constitution.    There were differences of opinion over all the questions which had  led to the calling of the Federal Convention and the framing of the  Constitution and so there was inevitably a division upon the result of  the Convention's work. There were those who wanted national authority  for the suppression of disorder and of what threatened to be anarchy  throughout the Union; and on the other hand there were those who opposed  a strongly organized government through fear of its destroying liberty.  Especially debtors and creditors took opposite sides, and most of the  people in the United States could have been brought under one or  the other category. The former favored a system of government and  legislation which would tend to relieve or postpone the payment of  debts; and, as that relief would come more readily from the State  Governments, they were naturally the friends of State rights and State  authority and were opposed to any enlargement of the powers of the  Federal Government. On the other hand, were those who felt the necessity  of preserving inviolate every private and public obligation and who  saw that the separate power of the States could not accomplish what was  necessary to sustain both public and private credit; they were  disposed to use the resources of the Union and accordingly to favor the  strengthening of the national government. In nearly every State there  was a struggle between these classes.    In Philadelphia and the neighborhood there was great enthusiasm for the  new Constitution. Almost simultaneously with the action by Congress, and  before notification of it had been received, a motion was introduced  in the Pennsylvania Assembly to call a ratifying convention. The  Anti-Federalists were surprised by the suddenness of this proposal and  to prevent action absented themselves from the session of the Assembly,  leaving that body two short of the necessary quorum for the transaction  of business. The excitement and indignation in the city were so great  that early the next morning a crowd gathered, dragged two of the  absentees from their lodgings to the State House, and held them firmly  in their places until the roll was called and a quorum counted, when the  House proceeded to order a State convention. As soon as the news of this  vote got out, the city gave itself up to celebrating the event by  the suspension of business, the ringing of church bells, and other  demonstrations. The elections were hotly contested, but the Federalists  were generally successful. The convention met towards the end of  November and, after three weeks of futile discussion, mainly upon  trivial matters and the meaning of words, ratified the Constitution on  the 12th of December, by a vote of forty-six to twenty-three. Again the  city of Philadelphia celebrated.    Pennsylvania was the first State to call a convention, but its final  action was anticipated by Delaware, where the State convention met and  ratified the Constitution by unanimous vote on the 7th of December. The  New Jersey convention spent only a week in discussion and then voted,  also unanimously, for ratification on the 18th of December. The next  State to ratify was Georgia, where the Constitution was approved without  a dissenting vote on January 2, 1788. Connecticut followed immediately  and, after a session of only five days, declared itself in favor of the  Constitution, on the 9th of January, by a vote of over three to one.    The results of the campaign for ratification thus far were most  gratifying to the Federalists, but the issue was not decided. With the  exception of Pennsylvania, the States which had acted were of lesser  importance, and, until Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia should  declare themselves, the outcome would be in doubt. The convention  of Massachusetts met on the same day that the Connecticut convention  adjourned. The sentiment of Boston, like that of Philadelphia, was  strongly Federalist; but the outlying districts, and in particular the  western part of the State, where Shays' Rebellion had broken out, were  to be counted in the opposition. There were 355 delegates who took part  in the Massachusetts convention, a larger number than was chosen in  any of the other States, and the majority seemed to be opposed to  ratification. The division was close, however, and it was believed that  the attitude of two men would determine the result. One of these was  Governor John Hancock, who was chosen chairman of the convention but  who did not attend the sessions at the outset, as he was confined to  his house by an attack of gout, which, it was maliciously said,  would disappear as soon as it was known which way the majority of the  convention would vote. The other was Samuel Adams, a genuine friend  of liberty, who was opposed on principle to the general theory of the  government set forth in the Constitution. \"I stumble at the threshold,\"  he wrote. \"I meet with a national government, instead of a federal union  of sovereign states.\" But, being a shrewd politician, Adams did not  commit himself openly and, when the tradesmen of Boston declared  themselves in favor of ratification, he was ready to yield his personal  opinion.    There were many delegates in the Massachusetts convention who felt that  it was better to amend the document before them than to try another  Federal Convention, when as good an instrument might not be devised. If  this group were added to those who were ready to accept the Constitution  as it stood, they would make a majority in favor of the new government.  But the delay involved in amending was regarded as dangerous, and it was  argued that, as the Constitution made ample provision for changes, it  would be safer and wiser to rely upon that method. The question was one,  therefore, of immediate or future amendment. Pressure was accordingly  brought to bear upon Governor Hancock and intimations were made to  him of future political preferment, until he was persuaded to  propose immediate ratification of the Constitution, with an urgent  recommendation of such amendments as would remove the objections of  the Massachusetts people. When this proposal was approved by Adams, its  success was assured, and a few days later, on the 6th of February, the  convention voted 187 to 168 in favor of ratification. Nine amendments,  largely in the nature of a bill of rights, were then demanded, and  the Massachusetts representatives in Congress were enjoined \"at all  times,... to exert all their influence, and use all reasonable and  legal methods, To obtain a ratification of the said alterations and  provisions.\" On the very day this action was taken, Jefferson wrote  from Paris to Madison: \"I wish with all my soul that the nine first  conventions may accept the new Constitution, to secure to us the good  it contains; but I equally wish that the four latest, whichever they may  be, may refuse to accede to it till a declaration of rights be annexed.\"    Boston proceeded to celebrate as Philadelphia, and Benjamin Lincoln  wrote to Washington, on the 9th of February, enclosing an extract from  the local paper describing the event:    \"By the paper your Excellency will observe some account of the parade  of the Eighth the printer had by no means time eno' to do justice to  the subject.

During the later months of the year, four other parties were sent out,  in all numbering nearly seven hundred. Through extensive advertisement  by the company, through the general interest in the subject and the  natural flow of emigration to the West, Kansas was receiving large  accessions of free-state settlers.    Meanwhile the men of Missouri, some of whom had striven for a decade to  secure the privilege of extending slavery into the new Territory, were  not idle. Instantly upon the removal of legal barriers, they occupied  adjacent lands, founded towns, staked out claims, formed plans for  preempting the entire region and for forestalling or driving out all  intruders. They had at first the advantage of position, for they did not  find it difficult to maintain two homes, one in Kansas for purposes of  voting and fighting and another in Missouri for actual residence. Andrew  H. Reeder, a Pennsylvania Democrat of strong pro-slavery prejudices, was  appointed first Governor of the Territory. When he arrived in Kansas  in October, 1854, there were already several thousand settlers on the  ground and others were continually arriving. He appointed the 29th of  November for the election of a delegate to Congress. On that day several  hundred Missourians came into the Territory and voted. There was no  violence and no contest; the free-state men had no separate candidate.  Notwithstanding the violence of language used by opposing factions,  notwithstanding the organization of secret societies pledged to drive  out all Northern intruders, there was no serious disturbance until  March 30, 1855, the day appointed for the election of members of the  territorial Legislature. On that day the Missourians came full five  thousand strong, armed with guns, bowie-knives, and revolvers. They  met with no resistance from the residents, who were unarmed. They  took charge of the precincts and chose pro-slavery delegates with one  exception. Governor Reeder protested and recommended to the precincts  the filing of protests. Only seven responded, however, and in these  cases new elections were held and contesting delegates elected.    The Governor issued certificates to these and to all those who in  other precincts had been chosen by the horde from Missouri. When the  Legislature met in July, the seven contests were decided in favor of  the pro-slavery party, the single freestate member resigned, and the  assembly was unanimous.    Governor Reeder fully expected that President Pierce would nullify the  election, and to this end he made a journey to Washington in April.  On the way he delivered a public address at Easton, Pennsylvania,  describing in lurid colors the outrage which had been perpetrated  upon the people of Kansas by the \"border ruffians\" from Missouri,  and asserting that the accounts in the Northern press had not been  exaggerated.    While Governor Reeder in contact with the actual events in Kansas was  becoming an active Free-soiler, President Pierce in association with  Jefferson Davis and others of his party was developing active sympathies  with the people of western Missouri. To the President this invasion  of territory west of the slave State by Northern men aided by Northern  corporations seemed a violation of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and  he sought to induce Reeder to resign. This, however, the Governor  positively refused to do unless the President would formally approve  his conduct in Kansas--an endorsement which required more fortitude than  President Pierce possessed. On his return to Kansas, determined to do  what he could to protect the Kansas people from injustice, he called  the Legislature to meet at Pawnee, a point far removed from the Missouri  border. Immediately upon their organization at that place the members  of the Legislature adjourned to meet at Shawnee, near the border of  Missouri. The Governor, who decided that this action was illegal, then  refused to recognize the Assembly at the new place. A deadlock thus  ensued which was broken on the 15th of August by the removal of Governor  Reeder and the appointment of Wilson Shannon of Ohio in his place. In  the meantime the territorial Legislature had adjourned, having \"enacted\"  an elaborate proslavery code made up from the slave code of Missouri  with a number of special adaptations. For example, it was made a  penitentiary offense to deny by speaking or writing, or by printing, or  by introducing any printed matter, the right of persons to hold  slaves in the Territory; no man was eligible to jury service who was  conscientiously opposed to holding slaves; and lawyers were bound by  oath to support the territorial statutes.    The free-state men, with the approval of Reeder, refused to recognize  the Legislature and inaugurated a movement in the fall of 1855 to adopt  a constitution and to organize a provisional territorial Government  preparatory to admission as a State, following in this respect the  procedure in California and Michigan. A convention met in Topeka in  October, 1855, and completed on the 11th of November the draft of a  constitution which prohibited slavery. On the 15th of December the  constitution was approved by a practically unanimous vote, only  free-state men taking part in the election. A month later a Legislature  was elected and at the same time Charles Robinson was elected Governor  of the new commonwealth. In the previous October, Reeder had been chosen  Free-soil delegate to Congress. The Topeka freestate Legislature met on  the 4th of March, 1856, and after petitioning Congress to admit Kansas  under the Topeka constitution, adjourned until the 4th of July pending  the action of Congress. Thus at the end of two years two distinct  Governments had come into existence within the Territory of Kansas. It  speaks volumes for the self-control and moderation of the two parties  that no hostile encounter had occurred between the contestants. When the  armed Missourians came in March, 1855, the unarmed settlers offered no  resistance. Afterward, however, they supplied themselves with Sharp's  rifles and organized a militia. With the advent of Governor Shannon  in September, 1855, the proslavery position was much strengthened. In  November, in a quarrel over a land claim, a free-state settler by the  name of Dow was killed. The murderer escaped, but a friend of the victim  was accused of uttering threats against a friend of the murderer. For  this offense a posse led by Sheriff Jones, a Missourian, seized him,  and would have carried him away if fourteen freestate men had not  \"persuaded\" the Sheriff to surrender his prisoner. This interference was  accepted by the Missourians as a signal for battle. The rescuers must  be arrested and punished. A large force of infuriated Missourians and  pro-slavery settlers assembled for a raid upon the town of Lawrence.  In the meantime the Lawrence militia planned and executed a systematic  defense of the town. When the two armies came within speaking distance,  a parley ensued in which the Governor took a leading part in settling  the affair without a hostile shot. This is known in Kansas history as  the \"Wakarusa War.\"    The progress of affairs in Kansas was followed with intense interest in  all parts of the country. North and South vied with each other in the  encouragement of emigration to Kansas. Colonel Buford of Alabama sold a  large number of slaves and devoted the proceeds to meeting the expense  of conducting a troop of three hundred men to Kansas in the winter of  1856. They went armed with \"the sword of the spirit,\" and all provided  with Bibles supplied by the leading churches. Arrived in the territory,  they were duly furnished with more worldly weapons and were drilled for  action. About the same time a parallel incident is said to have occurred  in New Haven, Connecticut. A deacon in one of the churches had enlisted  a company of seventy bound for Kansas. A meeting was held in the church  to raise money to defray expenses. The leader of the company declared  that they also needed rifles for self-defense. Forthwith Professor  Silliman, of the University, subscribed one Sharp's rifle, and others  followed with like pledges. Finally Henry Ward Beecher, who was the  speaker of the occasion, rose and promised that, if twenty-five  rifles were pledged on the spot, Plymouth Church in Brooklyn would  be responsible for the remaining twenty-five that were needed. He had  already said in a previous address that for the slaveholders of Kansas,  Sharp's rifles were a greater moral agency than the Bible. This led  to the designation of the weapons as \"Beecher's Bibles.\" Such was the  spirit which prevailed in the two sections of the country.    President Pierce had now become intensely hostile towards the free-state  inhabitants of Kansas. Having recognized the Legislature elected on  March 30, 1855, as the legitimate Government, he sent a special  message to Congress on January 24, 1856, in which he characterized as  revolutionary the movement of the free-state men to organize a separate  Government in Kansas. From the President's point of view, the emissaries  of the New England Emigrant Aid Association were unlawful invaders.  In this position he not only had the support of the South, but was  powerfully seconded by Stephen A. Douglas and other Northern Democrats.    The attitude of the Administration at Washington was a source of great  encouragement to Sheriff Jones and his associates, who were anxious to  wreak their vengeance on the city of Lawrence for the outcome of the  Wakarusa War. Jones came to Lawrence apparently for the express purpose  of picking a quarrel, for he revived the old dispute about the rescuing  party of the previous fall. As a consequence one enraged opponent  slapped him in the face, and at last an unknown assassin entered the"]]]
