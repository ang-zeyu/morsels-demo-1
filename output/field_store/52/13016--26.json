If it       is not right, let it go out of the way; but if it is right, there       is no occasion that we should reject it, or ignore it. We make       the statement that the Government derives its just powers from       the consent of the governed, and that all human beings have equal       rights. This is not an _ism_--it is simply an assertion that we       shall be true to the highest truth.         A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE: The question was asked, as I entered this       house, \"Is it right for women to meet here and intermeddle in our       public affairs?\" It is the greatest possible absurdity for women       to stand on that platform and talk of loyalty to a Government in       which nine-tenths of the politicians of the land say they have no       right to interfere, and still oppose Woman's Rights. The very act       of standing there is an endorsement of Woman's Rights.         A VOICE: I believe this is a woman's meeting. Men have no right       to speak here.         THE GENTLEMAN CONTINUED: It is on woman more than on man that the       real evils of this war settle. It is not the soldier on the       battle-field that suffers most; it is the wife, the mother, the       daughter. (Applause. Cries of \"Question, question\").         A VOICE: You are not a woman, sit down.         SUSAN B. ANTHONY: Some of us who sit upon this platform have many       a time been clamored down, and told that we had no right to       speak, and that we were out of our place in public meetings; far       be it from us, when women assemble, and a man has a thought in       his soul, burning for utterance, to retaliate upon him. (Laughter       and applause).         The resolution was then put to vote.         A VOICE: Allow me to inquire if men have a right to vote on this       question?         THE PRESIDENT: I suppose men who are used to business know that       they should _not_ vote here. We give them the privilege of       speaking.         The resolution was carried by a large majority.         SUSAN B. ANTHONY: The resolution recommending the practical work,       has not yet been prepared. We have a grand platform on which to       stand, and I hope we shall be able to present a plan of work       equally grand. But, Mrs. President, if we should fail in doing       this, we shall not fail to enunciate the principles of democracy       and republicanism which underlie the structure of a free       government. When the heads and hearts of the women of the North       are fully imbued with the true idea, their hands will find a way       to secure its accomplishment.         There is evidently very great earnestness on the part of all       present to settle upon some practical work. I therefore ask that       the women from every State of the Union, who are delegates here       from Loyal Leagues and Aid Societies, shall retire, at the close       of this meeting, to the lecture-room of this church, and there we       will endeavor to fix upon the best possible plan we can gather       from the counsels of the many. I hope this enthusiasm may be       directed to good and legitimate ends, and not allowed to       evaporate into thin air. I hope we shall aid greatly in the       establishment of this Government on the everlasting foundation of       justice to all.      BUSINESS MEETING.    The lecture-room was crowded with representatives from the different  States--Susan B. Anthony in the chair. There was a general expression  in favor of forming a Woman's Loyal National League, which ended in  the adoption of the following resolution:         _Resolved_, That we, loyal women of the nation, assembled in       convention in New York, this 14th day of May, 1863, do hereby       pledge ourselves one to another in a Loyal League, to give       support to the Government in so far as it makes the war for       freedom.    This pledge was signed by nearly every woman present. Mrs. Stanton was  elected president unanimously, and Miss Anthony, Secretary. Many women  spoke ably and eloquently; women who had never before heard their own  voices in a public meeting, discussed nice points of law and  constitution in a manner that would have done credit to any  legislative assembly. A deep religious tone of loyalty to God and  Freedom pervaded the entire meeting. It was an occasion not soon to be  forgotten. Women of all ages were assembled there, from the matron of  threescore years and ten to the fair girl whose interest in the war  had brought to her a premature sadness and high resolve. But of all  who mourned the loss of husbands, brothers, sons, and lovers, no word  of fear, regret, or doubt was uttered. All declared themselves ready  for any sacrifice, and expressed an unwavering faith in the glorious  future of a true republic. The interest in the meeting kept up until  so late an hour that it was decided to adjourn, to meet the next  afternoon.      EVENING SESSION.    The evening session was held in Cooper Institute, Mrs. Stanton  presiding. An address to the President was read by Miss Anthony, which  was subsequently adopted and sent to him.         _The Loyal Women of the Country to Abraham Lincoln, President of       the United States._         Having heard many complaints of the want of enthusiasm among       Northern women in the war, we deemed it fitting to call a       National Convention. From every free State, we have received the       most hearty responses of interest in each onward step of the       Government as it approaches the idea of a true republic. From the       letters received, and the numbers assembled here to-day, we can       with confidence address you in the name of the loyal women of the       North.         We come not to criticise or complain. Not for ourselves or our       friends do we ask redress of specific grievances, or posts of       honor or emolument. We speak from no considerations of mere       material gain; but, inspired by true patriotism, in this dark       hour of our nation's destiny, we come to pledge the loyal women       of the Republic to freedom and our country. We come to strengthen       you with earnest words of sympathy and encouragement. We come to       thank you for your proclamation, in which the nineteenth century       seems to echo back the Declaration of Seventy-six. Our fathers       had a vision of the sublime idea of liberty, equality, and       fraternity; but they failed to climb the heights that with       anointed eyes they saw. To us, their children, belongs the work       to build up the living reality of what they conceived and       uttered.         It is not our mission to criticise the past. Nations, like       individuals, must blunder and repent. It is not wise to waste one       energy in vain regret, but from each failure rise up with renewed       conscience and courage for nobler action. The follies and faults       of yesterday we cast aside as the old garments we have outgrown.       Born anew to freedom, slave creeds and codes and constitutions       must now all pass away. \"For men do not put new wine into old       bottles, else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and       the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new bottles, and       both are preserved.\"         Our special thanks are due to you, that by your Proclamation two       millions of women are freed from the foulest bondage humanity       ever suffered. Slavery for man is bad enough, but the refinements       of cruelty must ever fall on the mothers of the oppressed race,       defrauded of all the rights of the family relation, and violated       in the most holy instincts of their nature. A mother's life is       bound up in that of her child. There center all her hopes and       ambition. But the slave-mother, in her degradation, rejoices not       in the future promise of her daughter, for she knows by       experience what her sad fate must be. No pen can describe the       unutterable agony of that mother whose past, present, and future       are all wrapped in darkness; who knows the crown of thorns she       wears must press her daughter's brow; who knows that the       wine-press she now treads, unwatched, those tender feet must       tread alone. For, by the law of slavery, \"the child follows the       condition of the mother.\"         By your act, the family, that great conservator of national       virtue and strength, has been restored to millions of humble       homes, around whose altars coming generations shall magnify and       bless the name of Abraham Lincoln. By a mere stroke of the pen       you have emancipated millions from a condition of wholesale       concubinage. We now ask you to finish the work by declaring that       nowhere under our national flag shall the motherhood of any race       plead in vain for justice and protection. So long as one slave       breathes in this Republic, we drag the chain with him. God has so       linked the race, man to man, that all must rise or fall together.       Our history exemplifies this law. It was not enough that we at       the North abolished slavery for ourselves, declared freedom of       speech and the press, built up churches, colleges, and free       schools, studied the science of morals, government, and economy,       dignified labor, amassed wealth, whitened the sea with our       commerce, and commanded the respect and admiration of the nations       of the earth, so long as the South, by the natural proclivities       of slavery, was sapping the very foundations of our national       life....         You are the first President ever borne on the shoulders of       freedom into the position you now fill. Your predecessors owed       their elevation to the slave oligarchy, and in serving slavery       they did but obey their masters. In your election, Northern       freemen threw off the yoke.

And so, amidst  all their disadvantages, the success and reputation of our artists  steadily increased, and the critics accorded them high rank as  musicians; Mason, Gottschalk, and others among the finest pianists of  the country, receiving Cleveland Luca, the pianist, as an equal.    In the year 1854 the family experienced a sad shock in the death of  Simeon G. Luca.    As before intimated, he was a vocalist and violinist of remarkable  powers; and professionally, as well as otherwise, his loss to the  troupe was a great one.    The vacancy occasioned by his death was filled by the engagement of  Miss Jennie Allen of New York. She proved to be a very valuable  acquisition to the troupe; for she possessed a rich contralto voice,  sang with excellent method, had a graceful, winning stage appearance,  and was well known in New York as a very fine pianist.    The quartet thus arranged then (in 1857) began to travel more  extensively, giving performances in the States of New York,  Pennsylvania, and Ohio, where their success artistically and  financially exceeded any thing before within their experience. Had  they so chosen, they might have visited all the free States with  assurance of good fortune. Wherever they went, the bitter  color-prejudice, the chilling doubtings, or the cold indifference,  displayed by those who had not heard these talented musicians, were  rapidly dispelled when on the stage they beheld their easy, graceful  appearance, and heard the delightful sounds of harmony that proceeded  from the voices and instruments of this accomplished quartet. The  writer well remembers the emotions of delight and pride that filled  his own breast when at this period, in Ohio, he witnessed for the  first time their performances. After their first concert, the town  became the scene of a most pleasant commotion. No such music had ever  before been heard there, and praises of the \"Lucas\" were on the lips  of all. The family were entertained at the residences of the first  citizens, who vied with each other in extending to them the most  complimentary attentions. In these homes of wealth and culture, where  the study and practice of choice music formed a portion of each day's  employment, these talented artists, surrounded by a selected company  of educated persons, shone even more brightly than when upon the  public stage; for here they could confine themselves to a rendition of  that higher class of music so suitable to their own tastes and powers,  as well as most welcome to their cultivated audience. But what befell  the Luca family in this town--the writer has mentioned somewhat  particularly this instance, because he happened to be a witness of the  same--is but a sample of the treatment they often received in other  places while travelling over the country.    As representing the estimate of the musical abilities of the Luca  family, held by the general press of the country during their concert  tours, and in order that it may be seen that my own praises of the  family are none too great, I give the following notice from a fair and  disinterested source; viz., \"The Niagara Courier\" of Lockport, N.Y.,  of Sept. 2, 1857:--         \"THE LUCA FAMILY.         \"This company of singers, consisting of four [three]       brothers and their mother, gave a concert at Ringueberg Hall       last (Monday) evening; and their performance was such as to       elicit the enthusiastic approval of all present. Coming       among us as strangers, their merits were not generally       understood; and we presume that the entire audience were       agreeably disappointed in the entertainment presented. We       hazard nothing in saying that we have not had in our place       for years a concert which combined all the elements that       please the musical ear, and satisfy the cultivated taste, as       did this. The introductory piece, 'Fantasia,' from Lucia,       evinced the highest order of musical culture, the most       excellent taste, with that superior power of execution which       long practice only gives. The two brothers John and       Alexander have superb voices, guided by a correct knowledge       of music, and enriched by cultivation. Madame Luca was       laboring under indisposition; but she sang well, and gave       abundant assurance of superior vocal powers. But the great       feature of the entertainment was the performance of C.O.       Luca on the piano. With the exception of the celebrated       Mason, we have never had his superior as a pianist in       Lockport; and even he could not execute the pieces presented       with greater effect. There is music in his playing which we       seldom hear from the piano. It is not simply the striking of       the keys in order, emitting a succession of musical sounds;       but it is one continual flow of melody without interruption.       From the moment he first strikes the keys, the harmonious       melody gushes forth, note melts into note imperceptibly,       wave after wave of melody goes forth and mingles into one as       do the waves of the sea; and there is no breaking of the       majesty of its harmony until the last note is touched.         \"The family, as has been before announced, are colored, and       consequently labor under some disadvantages; but we predict       for them a successful future. Such superior musical powers       must win for them a reputation that will bring its       recompense. The pieces they sing are selected with good       taste, and evince a determination to deserve public favor.       And we may here say, that we believe the Luca family, in the       quiet and unostentatious display of their musical powers,       are doing more to secure position for the colored man than       all the theorists and speculators about the right of man       have yet accomplished in America. The possession of such       talent, and its cultivation, show genius and industry which       any man might emulate; and, when the colored men shall be       represented in all the arts and sciences by those who are       able to occupy front ranks, they will need no moralist to       assert their rights: they can then maintain their own       position. The human mind is so constituted, that it will       always pay homage to genius, let it be exhibited under a       white or black surface.         \"A large number of the audience joined in a request that the       Luca family repeat their concert; and they have consented to       do so on Friday evening next, when we hope to see an       audience out worthy of their superior merits. In the mean       time we commend the Luca family to the press wherever they       shall go, as every way worthy of their aid and indorsement.\"    During their second tour of Ohio, in 1859, the \"Lucas\" met and joined  the famous Hutchinson family, giving many entertainments in  conjunction with them. The Hutchinsons thus proved the entire  sincerity of their professions that they loved their brother man \"for  a' that.\" The press of the country was much excited over this novel  union, and the expressions emanating from the former were various.  Without, however, minding the pros or cons, these two troupes  travelled more than a month together, experiencing a pleasurable and  profitable season.    I append below two advertisements of concerts given by these troupes  at the time mentioned:--    (I.)    [Illustration:    THE HUTCHINSON FAMILY,    ASA B., LIZZIE C., and LITTLE FREDDY;    with the    LUCA BROTHERS,    JOHN AND ALEXANDER, AND CLEVELAND,    THE WONDERFUL PIANIST!    _HUMOR, SENTIMENT, AND OPERA!_    From the established reputation of both these companies, a  rare treat may be expected.]    (II.)    [Illustration:    By SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS,    THE HUTCHINSONS    will be assisted at their    _CONCERT_    in this place by the    LUCA FAMILY,    with their    Wonderful Pianist!]    As a reflection of the terrible, the foul spirit of caste, then so  largely prevailing, I regret that it is my duty to append the  following elegant (?) extract from a paper published at Fremont, O.,  Feb. 25, 1859:--         \"The Hutchinsons,--Asa B., Lizzie C., and little       Freddy,--accompanied by the Luca family, gave a concert at       Birchard Hall on last Wednesday evening. The house was not       more than a paying one. When we went to the concert, we       anticipated a rare treat; but, alas! how wofully were we       disappointed!... We have, perhaps, a stronger feeling of       prejudice than we should have felt under other       circumstances, had their abolition proclivities been less       startling; but to see respectable white persons (we presume       they are such) travelling hand in hand with a party of       negroes, and eating at the same table with them, is rather       too strong a pill to be gulped down by a democratic       community.\"    No doubt the writer of the above, if now living, would be ashamed to  utter sentiments so uncharitable and so vile.    But as an evidence of honest criticism, and in pleasing contrast with  the foregoing, I give the following.    \"The Norwalk (O.) Reflector,\" March 1, 1859, says,--         \"The concert given in this place on Saturday night last by       the Hutchinsons and Lucas was among the best musical       entertainments ever given here. The audience was large, and       the artists sang with spirit.         \"Where all sang so well, it is difficult to select the       best.... The Lucas are charming musicians, both instrumental       and vocal; and, when two such companies unite, there will be       superior concerts.\"    A Sandusky (O.) paper, March 1, 1859, says,--         \"The Hutchinsons and Lucas sang to quite a full audience at       West's Hall last evening. The performance could not, coming       from troupes possessing talent varied and of the higher       order, be otherwise than good. These bands, when they       united, made a"]]]
