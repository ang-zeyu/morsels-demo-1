Tests for mental ability were not given in this case, there was  no need for it.  Her marks in the preparatory course were just  fair.  It had been noted by her teachers, as well as by her  foster parents, that she was prone to have periods when attention  to her work seemed difficult.  Aside from her peculiarities,  which showed themselves entirely in her fabricating tendency and  her assumed illnesses, nothing much out of the way in her mental  life had ever been noted.  On several occasions she had taken to  her bed, but when a physician was called, a diagnosis was given  of simulation, or hysteria.  Nothing like major hysterical  attacks at any time occurred,    From most excellent sources of information we have obtained an  account of the family history.  No instance of insanity is known,  but it is said there is much evidence of ignorance and  superstition.  Marie's mother bore a good character, but was  decidedly ignorant.  At about the age of 50 she made a homicidal  attack upon a second husband and then killed herself.  The father  was an industrious and sober laborer, but unable to support his  large family.  At his death in Marie's early childhood the family  was broken up and the ten children were distributed about.  None  of the children is said to be abnormal mentally, but there has  been a tendency to free living, even on the part of the older  sisters.  It seems very sure that no other member of the family  was given to telling false stories.  The brothers have been  inclined to be shiftless and to roam, but then the environmental  conditions often have been against them.  However, some of them  have done well.  In general, as far as Marie is concerned, it may  be said early home environment was not bad except on account of  poverty.  Marie bears no traces of having suffered from defective  conditions before or after birth.  Her early developmental  history appears to be negative.  She has lived about in several  different homes, the longest stay being about seven years.  In  one place she was suspected of masturbation, but we were unable  to get a perfectly definite statement that she was addicted to  the habit.    Two years prior to the time we knew Marie she had worked up a  story of adventure in which she was the heroine.  She used the  telephone to call for help, stating that she stood with a  revolver covering a burglar.  From this incident she gained a  good deal of notoriety.  The police found there was nothing to  the case and later Marie herself made a confession.  By the time  we saw her this story varied somewhat from her original  statement, but was still persisted in, although she must have  known that we could readily trace the actual occurrence.    After Marie had continued her stories for a few weeks while  attending the university they had grown so that they included  night visitations in her boarding-house from the man who was said  to be hounding her, she was found once more impossible to deal  with and, as her work became poorer, she had to leave.  At this  period it was most significant to us that in spite of her  expressed desire for freedom from persecution she did not want us  to look further into her case because of certain mysterious  letters which would incriminate her.  We felt entirely convinced  that the several reports which we received of her career in  preceding years gave a satisfactory clew to her character,  although we were never able to analyze the case far enough to  ascertain the genetic features.  Thus it is impossible to make  any summary of causative factors.        CASE 6    Summary:  A thoroughly characteristic example of the type of  pathological lying which led to the invention of the term  pseudologia phantastica.  A young woman, well endowed physically  and mentally, for years has often been indulging in extensive  fabrications which have no discernible basis in advantages  accruing to herself.  The peculiarities of the falsifications  have given rise to much trouble for her, her family, and for many  others who have been incidentally connected with the situation.  The genesis of the tendency was finally found in early  experiences about which there have been much mental repression  and conflict.  In the background there was also defective home  control and chronic neuropathic tendencies in both parents and in  their kin.      Janet B., 19 years old, we saw first in an eastern city at the  request of her parents.  There she had become involved in  troubles which seemed particularly hard to unravel.  However, we  were told that this was an old story with her.  A diagnosis of  her mental condition was asked, and recommendations for the  future.  Janet had told some very peculiar stories at her place  of employment where she was doing very well as a newcomer,  without any seeming reason for fabrication.  Several who had  become interested in her were wondering if she were quite sane.    After having made her way alone to New York, Janet readily  obtained employment.  After a couple of weeks she approached a  department manager of the concern for which she worked and  related a long story, which at once aroused his sympathy.  She  told him that her father and mother had died in the last year and  that she was entirely dependent upon herself.  When she was about  four years of age she had been in a terrible accident and a  certain man had saved her life.  Naturally, her father had always  thought very highly of this person and had pensioned him.  Formerly he lived up in the country with his family, but at  present was old, penniless, and alone in the city.  Now that her  parents were dead she was in a quandary about keeping up her  father's obligation to the old man.  Out of her $8 a week it was  hard to make both ends meet.  She had to pay her own board and  for this man also.  She found that he needed to be taken care of  in every way; she had to wash his face and dress him, he was so  helpless.  She made no demand for any increase of salary and the  story was told evidently without any specific intent.  The  services of a social worker were enlisted by the firm and the  girl reiterated the same story to her, even though it was clearly  intended that the case should be investigated.  Janet's  boarding-house was visited and there she was found to be living  with distant relatives whom she had searched out upon her arrival  in the city.  They knew she had run away from home and, indeed,  by this time the mother herself was already in New York, having  been sent for by them.    The situation then became more complicated through the girl's  giving more explanatory details to the social worker, somewhat  accusing her own family.  It was at this time I first saw her.  She then acknowledged that this story of a man who had saved her  life was purely an invention.  Now she stated that in the western  town where she lived she had been engaged to a young man who was  discovered to be a defaulter and who had recently died.  When  this fellow was in trouble, his mother, while calling on Janet's  family, used to make signals to her and leave notes under the  table cover, asking for funds with which to help him out.  This  was a great strain upon Janet and even more so was his death.  She could stand it no longer and fled the city.  Her lover's  stealing was a secret which she had kept from her own family.    Before we had become acquainted with the true facts about the  family this girl gave us most extensive accounts of various  phases of her home life which included the most unlikely and  contradictory details.  For instance, they had a large house with  beautiful grounds, yet before she left home she bought a sewing  machine for her mother, which she is paying for on weekly  installments.  Her $8 a week is very little for her to live on  because she is paying this indebtedness.  Janet wishes now to  take out a twenty year endowment policy in favor of her mother.  Her brothers and sister are all very bright, she tells us, but  she has never been particularly close to any member of her family  except her mother.  The others always remind her that they are  better educated than she is.  She expects to take up French and  Spanish in the evenings because they would be very helpful to her  commercially.  She does not care to grow up, prefers simple  enjoyments, and has no desire for social affairs.  She is only  desirous of improving her education.  She relates her success as  a Sunday School teacher.  She thinks at times she is very  nervous, and especially when she was in the high school she  showed signs of it.  Then she used to stutter much, but of late  she has been able to control this.    At another time, very glibly and without the slightest show of  emotion, she continues with her story.  Tells of frequent  fainting spells when she goes from one attack into another.  She  has not had them just recently, but she used to have them at  home.  Tells us now that her mother has been very sick and she  has been worrying much about her.  She wanted to send money to  her and help support her.  `It's awfully hard on one to know your  mother is terribly sick and to think you can't reach her if  anything should happen.''  (It is to be remembered that all this  was told when the girl must have known, if she had thought at  all, that we would certainly get the full facts in a day or so.)    On the physical side we found a very well developed and well  nourished young woman.  Weight 148 lbs.  No sensory defect noted.  Moderately coarse features, broad deep chest, quiet and strong  attitude.  No signs whatever of nervousness.  Her only complaint  at present is of headaches and ``quivering'' attacks.  (We could  get no corroboration at all of either of these from any one  else.)  She frequently spoke of herself as entirely healthy  except for these slight ailments.

Daniel says, \"I saw in the night visions,  and behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,  and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before  him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that  all people, nations, and languages, should serve him; his dominion is  an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom  that which shall not be destroyed.\" Dan. vii. 13, 14. Zechariah says,  \"And his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which  is before Jerusalem on the East; and the Mount of Olives shall cleave  in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there  shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove  toward the north, and half of it toward the south. And ye shall flee  to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall  reach unto Azal; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the  earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah: and the Lord my God  shall come, and all the saints with thee.\" . . . . \"And the Lord shall  be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and  his name one.\" xiv. 4, 5, 9. These and many other things must be  fulfilled if the Scriptures be true. These designs of God, which were  the hope of the ancient Saints, and of which poets sung, and prophets  wrote, were the consolation of all the faithful Saints, Prophets, and  Patriarchs,--Jews and Christians. Take these away, and the world, to  the Saints, is a miserable blank; the hope of the righteous futile, and  the Word of God a farce.    Fourthly.--It would frustrate the designs of God, in regard to the  spirits of the righteous, the dead, the progression of the world, and  its final exaltation; and also the exaltation of man.    When the Lord created this world, as we have already stated, he had  an object in view, not only in regard to the world, and its future  destiny, but also as it regards the spirits which were then in  existence. Those great and eternal purposes which our heavenly Father,  in his consummate wisdom, had in view, when he issued his Divine  Mandate, and this world was created, cannot be frustrated unless he  cease to be God. And those enlivening hopes which cheered his sons;  those spirits that lived with him, when they saw this beautiful orb  fashioned, this earth made as the place for their habitation, as  their possession, as the place where they should take bodies, where  they should live, rule, and reign, not only in time, but in eternity,  must not, cannot be destroyed. And yet what avails it all to them, if  Satan triumph, the wicked rule, and God's kingdom be not established!  They could not \"have shouted for joy\" at the prospect of this world  continuing under the dominion of Satan; at the blight, degradation,  misery, and ruin that have overspread it. But if we trace the matter  still further, and look at the righteous dead, their position would  be any thing but enviable under those circumstances. It was the  hopes of the resurrection that made them endure, and it was God that  implanted them in their bosoms; but if they are not raised, and if  Christ's kingdom is not established, and they do not reign with him,  their hopes are vain, their sufferings useless, and the purposes of  God are frustrated. In vain did they bear a faithful testimony in  opposition to a depraved world; in vain they endured, as seeing him  that is invisible; in vain they wandered about in sheep skins, and in  goat skins; in vain they looked for a city which hath foundations, as  a recompense of reward; and false and deceptive are the testimonies of  all the prophets who have testified of the restitution of all things,  from the foundation of the world. Take away this, and our highest, and  most exalted hopes are blighted; we live like fools, and die like dogs.  If the world is always suffered to continue as it is, then is the hope  of the righteous vain, the promises of God fail, Satan triumphs, and  God's purposes are frustrated.    All the designs of God concerning this world and the work of creation,  were perfected in his mind before this world rolled into existence, or  \"e'er the morning stars sang together for joy.\" When this world was  formed, God intended it as the final dwelling place of those bodies  which should inhabit it. And when \"the sons of God shouted for joy,\"  it was at the prospect of that exaltation, that they would be capable  of obtaining, in consequence of this creation, which they then saw  come into existence. And if, as Jesus, they had to descend below all  things, in order that they might be raised above all things; still  this was the medium, or channel, through which they were to obtain  their ultimate exaltation, and glorification. It was by the union  of their spirits, which came forth from the Father as the \"Father  of Spirits,\" with earthly bodies, that perfect beings were formed,  capable of continued increase and eternal exaltation; that the spirit,  quick, subtle, refined, lively, animate, energetic, and eternal, might  have a body through which to operate, that might be compared to the  steam, to an engine; the electric fluid to the telegraphic wire; for,  notwithstanding that spirit, steam, or electricity are the powerful,  quickening, energetic principles, employed; yet without the engine,  the telegraphic wire, or the matter, they would be comparatively  useless; these elements might wander in empty space; spend their force  at random, or remain dormant, or useless, without those more tangible,  material objects, through which to exercise their force. When steam  was first applied to practical purposes; when the operation of the  magnetic needle, and the mode of communication through the electric  telegraph, were discovered; when railroads and steam boats were first  invented, something of importance was discovered, and of great value to  the human family. The men who made these discoveries and applications  are deservedly looked upon at the present time as men of great genius,  and as the benefactors of the world; but what was it they did? They  did not create the elements, those already existed: steam, magnetism,  electricity, iron, coals, water, existed before, and had existed from  the beginning of creation. What was it these geniuses discovered? It  was simply a method of organizing this matter, the making use of gross  inanimate materials to confine the more subtle, refined, elastic,  energetic, and powerful, that their combined power and energy might  be brought into effect; and that through the union of two powerful  agencies, which had lain dormant, their forces might be united, and be  brought into active and powerful operation. Thus, then, was the body  formed as an agent for the spirit. It was made of grosser materials  than the spirit, which proceeded from God, but was necessary as an  habitation for it that, it might be clothed with a body, perfect in  its organization, beautiful in its structure, symmetrical in its  proportions, and in every way fit for an eternal intelligent being;  that through it, it might speak, act, enjoy, and develop its power,  its intelligence, and perpetuate its species. Hence as the discoveries  of those geniuses already referred to, were hailed with pleasure by  the inhabitants of the world, on account of the benefits conferred  upon men, so when God created this earth, and organized men upon it,  \"the morning stars sung together for joy;\" they looked upon it as God  looked upon it, as a work perfect, magnificent, and glorious, through  which they saw their way to exaltation, glory, thrones, principalities,  powers, dominions, and eternal felicity. They had the intelligence  before, but now they saw a way through which to develop it. Through the  world's great Architect, their Father, they discovered a plan fraught  with intelligence and wisdom, reaching from eternity to eternity,  pointing out a means whereby, through obedience to celestial laws, they  might obtain the same power that he had. And if, in fallen humanity,  they might have to suffer for a while, they saw a way back to God, to  eternal exaltations, and to the multiplied, and eternally increasing  happiness of innumerable millions of beings. And if, as Jesus, they had  to descend below all things, it was that they might be raised above all  things, and take their position as sons of God, in the eternal world;  that overcoming the world they might sit down with Christ upon his  throne, as he overcame and sat down upon the Father's throne. Rev. iii.  21.    But again; this creation is unlike the works of man, which, however  excellent, and useful, all bear the marks of humanity, all are more  or less imperfect in their structure, and liable to a thousand  contingences, are more or less clumsy, cumbrous, and unwieldy, and must  be governed by numerous very limited laws; as for instance, you can  convey intelligence, but it must be exactly on the line of the electric  wire, you cannot go beyond its limits; you can make an engine work,  but it must be stationary; or if moving, must be confined to rails,  depth of water, and a thousand other contingences. None of these things  possess intelligence, nor the principles of life within themselves,  neither can they impart, nor perpetuate it to others, they are merely  machines, to be acted upon by man, and without man they cease to exist;  when one is worn out, or broken, another must be made at the same  toil and labour; possessing not the principles of life, they cannot  impart their likeness; whereas man, beasts, fish, fowl, and all the  animate works of God can. Man's works in comparison with God's, are  like comparing a child's wooden horse to the beautiful creature God has  made, or rather his penny whistle to the music of heaven, or the larger  boy's billiards to the motions of the planetary system. They possess no  intelligence, no powers, no"]]]
