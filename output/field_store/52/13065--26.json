As they could not call this  an _actual representation_, they invented a new name for it, and called  it a _virtual one_. It imposed on the English nation, who could not  object that others should be taxed rather than themselves; but with the  Americans it was a sophism! and this _virtual_ representation, instead  of an _actual_ one, terminated in our separation; \"which,\" says Mr.  Flood, \"at the time appeared to have swept away most of our glory and  our territory; forty thousand lives, and one hundred millions of  treasure!\"    That fatal expression which Rousseau had introduced, _l'Egalite des  Hommes_, which finally involved the happiness of a whole people, had he  lived he had probably shown how ill his country had understood. He could  only have referred in his mind to _political equality_, but not an  equality of possessions, of property, of authority, destructive of  social order and of moral duties, which must exist among every people.  \"Liberty,\" \"Equality,\" and \"Reform\" (innocent words!) sadly ferment the  brains of those who cannot affix any definite notions to them; they are  like those chimerical fictions in law, which declare the \"sovereign  immortal, proclaim his ubiquity in various places,\" and irritate the  feelings of the populace, by assuming that \"the king can never do  wrong!\" In the time of James the Second \"it is curious,\" says Lord  Russell, \"to read the conference between the Houses on the meaning of  the words 'deserted' and 'abdicated,' and the debates in the Lords  whether or no there is an original contract between king and people.\"  The people would necessarily decide that \"kings derived their power from  them;\" but kings were once maintained by a \"right divine,\" a \"confusion  of words,\" derived from two opposite theories, and both only relatively  true. When we listen so frequently to such abstract terms as \"the  majesty of the people,\" \"the sovereignty of the people,\" whence the  inference that \"all power is derived from the people,\" we can form no  definite notions: it is \"a confusion of words,\" contradicting all the  political experience which our studies or our observations furnish; for  sovereignty is established to rule, to conduct, and to settle the  vacillations and quick passions of the multitude. _Public opinion_  expresses too often the ideas of one party in place; and _public  interest_ those of another party out! Political axioms, from the  circumstance of having the notions attached to them unsettled, are  applied to the most opposite ends! \"In the time of the French  Directory,\" observes an Italian philosopher of profound views, \"in the  revolution of Naples, the democratic faction pronounced that 'Every act  of a tyrannical government is in its origin illegal;' a proposition  which at first sight seems self-evident, but which went to render all  existing laws impracticable.\" The doctrine of the illegality of the acts  of a tyrant was proclaimed by Brutus and Cicero, in the name of the  senate, _against the populace_, who had favoured Caesar's perpetual  dictatorship; and the populace of Paris availed themselves of it,  _against the National Assembly_.    This \"confusion of words,\" in time-serving politics, has too often  confounded right and wrong; and artful men, driven into a corner, and  intent only on its possession, have found no difficulty in solving  doubts, and reconciling contradictions. Our own history in revolutionary  times abounds with dangerous examples from all parties; of specious  hypotheses for compliance with the government of the day or the passions  of parliament. Here is an instance in which the subtle confuser of words  pretended to substitute two consciences, by utterly depriving a man of  any! When the unhappy Charles the First pleaded that to pass the bill of  attainder against the Earl of Strafford was against his conscience, that  remarkable character of \"boldness and impiety,\" as Clarendon  characterizes Williams, Archbishop of York, on this argument of  _conscience_ (a simple word enough), demonstrated \"that there were _two  sorts of conscience_, public and private; that his public conscience as  a king might dispense with his private conscience as a man!\" Such was  the ignominious argument which decided the fate of that great victim of  State! It was an impudent \"confusion of words\" when Prynne (in order to  quiet the consciences of those who were uneasy at warring with the king)  observed that the statute of twenty-fifth Edward the Third ran in the  singular number--\"If a man shall levy war against _the king_, and  therefore could not be extended to _the houses_, who are many and public  _persons_.\" Later, we find Sherlock blest with the spirit of Williams,  the Archbishop of York, whom we have just left. When some did not know  how to charge and to discharge themselves of the oaths to James the  Second and to William the Third, this confounder of words discovered  that there were _two rights_, as the other had that there were _two  consciences_; one was a providential right, and the other a legal right;  one person might very righteously claim and take a thing, and another as  righteously hold and keep it; but that _whoever got the better_ had the  _providential_ right by possession; and since all authority comes from  God, the people were obliged to transfer their allegiance to him as a  king of God's making; so that he who had the providential right  necessarily had the legal one! a very simple discovery, which must,  however, have cost him some pains; for this confounder of words was  himself confounded by twelve answers by non-jurors! A French politician  of this stamp recently was suspended from his lectureship for asserting  that _the possession of the soil_ was a right; by which principle, _any  king_ reigning over a country, whether by treachery, crime, and  usurpation, was a _legitimate sovereign_. For this convenient principle  the lecturer was tried, and declared not guilty--by persons who have  lately found their advantage in a confusion of words. In treaties  between nations, a \"confusion of words\" has been more particularly  studied; and that negotiator has conceived himself most dexterous who,  by this abuse of words, has retained an _arriere-pensee_ which may  fasten or loosen the ambiguous expression he had so cautiously and so  finely inlaid in his mosaic of treachery. A scene of this nature I draw  out of \"Mesnager's Negociation with the Court of England.\" When that  secret agent of Louis the Fourteenth was negotiating a peace, an  insuperable difficulty arose respecting the acknowledgment of the  Hanoverian succession. It was absolutely necessary, on this delicate  point, to quiet the anxiety of the English public and our allies; but  though the French king was willing to recognise Anne's title to the  throne, yet the settlement in the house of Hanover was incompatible with  French interests and French honour. Mesnager told Lord Bolingbroke that  \"the king, his master, would consent to any such article, _looking the  other way, as might disengage him from the obligation of that  agreement_, as the occasion should present.\" This ambiguous language was  probably understood by Lord Bolingbroke: at the next conference his  lordship informed the secret agent \"that the queen could not admit of  any _explanations, whatever her intentions might be_; that the  _succession_ was settled by act of parliament; that as to the private  sentiments of the queen, or of any about her, he could say nothing.\"  \"All this was said with such an air, as to let me understand that he  gave a _secret assent_ to what I had proposed, &c.; but he desired me to  drop the discourse.\" Thus two great negotiators, both equally urgent to  conclude the treaty, found an insuperable obstacle occur, which neither  could control. Two honest men would have parted; but the \"skilful  confounder of words,\" the French diplomatist, hit on an expedient; he  wrote the words which afterwards appeared in the preliminaries, \"That  Louis the Fourteenth will acknowledge the Queen of Great Britain in that  quality, as also _the succession of the crown according to the_ PRESENT  SETTLEMENT.\" \"The English agent,\" adds the Frenchman, \"would have had me  add--_on the house of Hanover_, but this I entreated him not to desire  of me.\" The term PRESENT SETTLEMENT, then, was that article which was  LOOKING THE OTHER WAY, _to disengage his master from the obligation of  that agreement_, as occasion should present! that is, that Louis the  Fourteenth chose to understand by the PRESENT SETTLEMENT the _old one_,  by which the British crown was to be restored to the Pretender! Anne and  the English nation were to understand it in their own sense--as the _new  one_, which transferred it to the house of Hanover!    When politicians cannot rely upon each other's interpretation of _one of  the commonest words_ in our language, how can they possibly act  together? The Bishop of Winchester has proved this observation, by the  remarkable anecdote of the Duke of Portland and Mr. Pitt, who, with a  view to unite parties, were to hold a conference _on_ FAIR _and_ EQUAL  _terms_. His grace did not object to the word FAIR, but the word EQUAL  was more specific and limited; and for a necessary preliminary, he  requested Mr. Pitt to inform him what he _understood_ by the word EQUAL?  Whether Pitt was puzzled by the question, or would not deliver up an  _arriere-pensee_, he put off the explanation to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#19)"],[1,"telegraph district. This proved advantageous on many occasions, and  once, at Auli-eta, was even necessary. We were surveyed with suspicious  glances as soon as we entered the station-house, and when we asked for  water to lave our hands and face, we were directed to the irrigating ditch  in the street. Our request for a better room was answered by the question,  if the one we had was not good enough, and how long we intended to occupy  that. Evidently our English conversation had gained for us the covert  reputation of being English spies, and this was verified in the minds of  our hosts when we began to ask questions about the city prisons we had  passed on our way. To every interrogation they replied, \"I don't know.\"  But presto, change, on the presentation of documents! Apologies were now  profuse, and besides tea, bread, and eggs, the usual rations of a Russian  post-station, we were exceptionally favored with chicken soup and  _verainyik_, the latter consisting of cheese wrapped and boiled in dough,  and then served in butter.    It has been the custom for travelers in Russia to decry the Russian  post-station, but the fact is that an appreciation of this rather  primitive form of accommodation depends entirely upon whether you approach  it from a European hotel or from a Persian khan. Some are clean, while  others are dirty. Nevertheless, it was always a welcome sight to see a  small white building looming up in the dim horizon at the close of a long  day's ride, and, on near approach, to observe the black and white striped  post in front, and idle tarantasses around it. At the door would be found  the usual crowd of Kirghiz post-drivers. After the presentation of  documents to the _starosta_, who would hesitate at first about quartering  our horses in the travelers' room, we would proceed at once to place our  dust-covered heads beneath the spindle of the washing-tank. Although by  this dripping-pan arrangement we would usually succeed in getting as much  water down our backs as on our faces, yet we were consoled by the thought  that too much was better than not enough, as had been the case in Turkey  and Persia. Then we would settle down before the steaming samovar to  meditate in solitude and quiet, while the rays of the declining sun shone  on the gilded eikon in the corner of the room, and on the chromo-covered  walls. When darkness fell, and the simmering music of the samovar had  gradually died away; when the flitting swallows in the room had ceased  their chirp, and settled down upon the rafters overhead, we ourselves  would turn in under our fur-lined coats upon the leather-covered benches.    In consequence of the first of a series of accidents to our wheels, we  were for several days the guests of the director of the botanical gardens  at Pishpek. As a branch of the Crown botanical gardens at St. Petersburg,  some valuable experiments were being made here with foreign seeds and  plants. Peaches, we were told, do not thrive, but apples, pears, cherries,  and the various kinds of berries, grow as well as they do at home. Rye,  however, takes three years to reach the height of one year in America.  Through the Russians, these people have obtained high-flown ideas of  America and Americans. We saw many chromos of American celebrities in the  various station-houses, and the most numerous was that of Thomas A.  Edison. His phonograph, we were told, had already made its appearance in  Pishpek, but the natives did not seem to realize what it was. \"Why,\" they  said, \"we have often heard better music than that.\" Dr. Tanner was not  without his share of fame in this far-away country. During his fast in  America, a similar, though not voluntary, feat was being performed here. A  Kirghiz messenger who had been despatched into the mountains during the  winter was lost in the snow, and remained for twenty-eight days without  food. He was found at last, crazed by hunger. When asked what he would  have to eat, he replied, \"Everything.\" They foolishly gave him  \"everything,\" and in two days he was dead. For a long time he was called  the \"Doctor Tanner of Turkestan.\"      [Illustration: UPPER VALLEY OF THE CHU RIVER.]    A divergence of seventy-five miles from the regular post-route was made in  order to visit Lake Issik Kul, which is probably the largest lake for its  elevation in the world, being about ten times larger than Lake Geneva, and  at a height of 5300 feet. Its slightly brackish water, which never  freezes, teems with several varieties of fish, many of which we helped to  unhook from a Russian fisherman's line, and then helped to eat in his  primitive hut near the shore. A Russian Cossack, who had just come over  the snow-capped Ala Tau, \"of the Shade,\" from Fort Narin, was also  present, and from the frequent glances cast at the fisherman's daughter we  soon discovered the object of his visit. The ascent to this lake, through  the famous Buam Defile, or Happy Pass, afforded some of the grandest  scenery on our route through Asia. Its seething, foaming, irresistible  torrent needs only a large volume to make it the equal of the rapids at  Niagara.    Our return to the post-road was made by an unbeaten track over the Ala Tau  mountains. From the Chu valley, dotted here and there with Kirghiz tent  villages and their grazing flocks and herds, we pushed our wheels up the  broken path, which wound like a mythical stairway far up into the  low-hanging clouds. We trudged up one of the steepest ascents we have ever  made with a wheel. The scenery was grand, but lonely. The wild tulips,  pinks, and verbenas dotting the green slopes furnished the only pleasant  diversion from our arduous labor. Just as we turned the highest summit,  the clouds shifted for a moment, and revealed before us two Kirghiz  horsemen. They started back in astonishment, and gazed at us as though we  were demons of the air, until we disappeared again down the opposite and  more gradual slope. Late in the afternoon we emerged upon the plain, but  no post-road or station-house was in sight, as we expected; nothing but a  few Kirghiz kibitkas among the straggling rocks, like the tents of the  Egyptian Arabs among the fallen stones of the pyramids.      [Illustration: KIRGHIZ ERECTING KIBITKAS BY THE CHU RIVER.]    Toward these we now directed our course, and, in view of a rapidly  approaching storm, asked to purchase a night's lodging. This was only too  willingly granted in anticipation of the coming _tomasha_, or exhibition.  The milkmaids as they went out to the rows of sheep and goats tied to the  lines of woolen rope, and the horsemen with reinless horses to drive in  the ranging herds, spread the news from tent to tent. By the time darkness  fell the kibitka was filled to overflowing. We were given the seat of  honor opposite the doorway, bolstered up with blankets and pillows. By the  light of the fire curling its smoke upward through the central opening in  the roof, it was interesting to note the faces of our hosts. We had never  met a people of a more peaceful temperament, and, on the other hand, none  more easily frightened. A dread of the evil eye is one of their  characteristics. We had not been settled long before the _ishan_, or  itinerant dervish, was called in to drive away the evil spirits, which the  \"devil's carts\" might possibly have brought. Immediately on entering, he  began to shrug his shoulders, and to shiver as though passing into a state  of trance. Our dervish acquaintance was a man of more than average  intelligence. He had traveled in India, and had even heard some one speak  of America. This fact alone was sufficient to warrant him in posing as  instructor for the rest of the assembly. While we were drinking tea, a  habit they have recently adopted from the Russians, he held forth at great  length to his audience about the _Amerikon_.    The rain now began to descend in torrents. The felt covering was drawn  over the central opening, and propped up at one end with a pole to emit  the clouds of smoke from the smoldering fire. This was shifted with the  veering wind. Although a mere circular rib framework covered with white or  brown felt, according as the occupant is rich or poor, the Kirghiz  kibitka, or more properly _yurt_, is not as a house builded upon the sand,  even in the fiercest storm. Its stanchness and comfort are surprising when  we consider the rapidity with which it may be taken down and transported.  In half an hour a whole village may vanish, emigrating northward in  summer, and southward in winter. Many a Kirghiz cavalcade was overtaken on  the road, with long tent-ribs and felts tied upon the backs of two-humped  camels, for the Bactrian dromedary has not been able to endure the  severities of these Northern climates. The men would always be mounted on  the camels' or horses' backs, while the women would be perched on the oxen  and bullocks, trained for the saddle and as beasts of burden. The men  never walk; if there is any leading to be done it falls to the women. The  constant use of the saddle has made many of the men bandy-legged, which,  in connection with their usual obesity,--with them a mark of dignity,--gives  them a comical appearance.    After their curiosity regarding us had been partly satisfied, it was  suggested that a sheep should be slaughtered in our honor. Neither meat  nor bread is ever eaten by any but the rich Kirghiz. Their universal  kumiss, corresponding to the Turkish yaourt, or coagulated milk, and other  forms of lacteal dishes, sometimes mixed with meal, form the chief diet of  the poor. The wife of our host, a buxom woman, who, as we had seen, could  leap upon a horse's back as readily as a man, now entered the doorway,  carrying a full-grown sheep by its woolly coat. This she twirled over on  its back, and held down with her knee while the butcher artist drew a  dagger from his belt, and held it aloft until the assembly stroked their  scant beards, and "]]]
