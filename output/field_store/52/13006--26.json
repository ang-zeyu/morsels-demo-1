So Polly began: \"Dear Mister Jasper we were all dreadfully sorry  that you didn't come and so we baked you some cakes.'--You didn't say  anything about his being sick, Ben.\"    \"I forgot it,\" said Ben, \"but I put it in farther down--you'll see if  you read on.\"    \"Baked you some cakes--that is, Polly did, for this is Ben that's  writing.\"    \"You needn't said that, Ben,\" said Polly, dissatisfied; \"we all baked  'em, I'm sure. 'And just as soon as you get well we do want you to come  over and have the baking. We're real sorry you're sick--boneset's good  for colds.\"    \"Oh, Ben!\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"I guess his father knows what to give  him.\"    \"And oh! the bitter stuff!\" cried Polly, with a wry face. \"Well, it's  hard work to write,\" said Ben, yawning. \"I'd rather chop wood.\"    \"I wish! knew how,\" exclaimed Joel, longingly.    \"Just you try every day; Ben'll teach you, Joe,\" said his mother,  eagerly, \"and then I'll let you write.\"    \"I will!\" cried Joe; \"then, Dave, you'll see how I'll write--I tell  you!\"    \"And I'm goin' to--ma, can't I?\" said Davie, unwilling to be outdone.    \"Yes, you may, be sure,\" said Mrs. Pepper, delighted; \"that'll make a  man of you fast.\"    \"Oh, boys,\" said Polly, lifting a very red face, \"you joggle the table  so I can't do anything.\"    \"I wasn't jogglin',\" said Joel; \"the old thing tipped. Look!\" he  whispered to Davie, \"see Polly, she's writing crooked.\"    So while the others hung around her and looked over her shoulder while  they made their various comments, Polly finished her part, and also held  it up for inspection.    \"Let us see,\" said Ben, taking it up.    \"It's after, 'boneset's good for colds,'\" said Polly, puckering up her  face again at the thought.    \"We most of us knew you were sick--I'm Polly now--because you didn't  come; and we liked your letter telling us so. Oh, Polly! we weren't glad  to hear he was sick!\" cried Ben, in horror.    \"I didn't say so!\" cried Polly, starting up. \"Why, Ben Pepper, I never  said so!\" and she looked ready to cry.    \"It sounds something like it, don't it, mammy?\" said Ben, unwilling to  give her pain, but appealing to Mrs. Pepper.    \"Polly didn't mean it,\" said her mother consolingly; \"but if I were you,  I'd say something to explain it.\"    \"I can't put anything in now,\" said poor Polly; \"there isn't any room  nor any more paper either--what shall I do! I told you, Ben, I couldn't  write.\" And Polly looked helplessly from one to the other for comfort.    \"Yes, you can,\" said Ben; \"there, now I'll show you: write it fine,  Polly--you write so big--little bits of letters, like these.\"    So Polly took the pen again with a sigh. \"Now he won't think so, I  guess,\" she said, much relieved, as Ben began to read again.    \"I'll begin yours again,\" Ben said: \"We most of us knew you were sick  because you didn't come, and we liked your letter telling us so because  we'd all felt so badly, and Phronsie cried herself to sleep--\" (that's  good, I'm sure.) \"The 'gingerbread boy' is for your father--please  excuse it, but Phronsie would make it for him because he is sick. There  isn't any more to write, and besides I can't write good, and Ben's  tired. From all of us.\"    \"Why, how's he to know?\" cried Ben. \"That won't do to sign it.\"    \"Well, let's say from Ben and Polly then,\" said Polly; \"only all the  others want to be in the letter.\"    \"Well, they can't write,\" said Ben.    \"We might sign their names for 'em,\" suggested Polly.    \"Here's mine,\" said Ben, putting under the \"From all of us\" a big, bold  \"Ben.\"    \"And here's mine,\" echoed Polly, setting a slightly crooked \"Polly\" by  its side.    \"Now Joe, you better let Ben hold your hand,\" said Polly, warningly. But  Joel declaring he could write had already begun, so there was no hope  for it; and a big drop of ink falling from the pen, he spattered the \"J\"  so that no one could tell what it was. The children looked at each other  in despair.    \"Can we ever get it out, mammy?\" said Polly, running to Mrs. Pepper with  it.    \"I don't know,\" said her mother. \"How could you try it, Joe?\"    \"I didn't mean to,\" said Joel, looking very downcast and ashamed. \"The  ugly old pen did it!\"    \"Well,\" said Polly, \"it's got to go; we can't help it.\" But she looked  so sorrowful over it that half the pleasure was gone for Ben; for Polly  wanted everything just right, and was very particular about things.    \"Now, Dave.\" Ben held his hand, and \"David\" went down next to Joel.    But when it was Phronsie's turn, she protested that Polly, and no one  else, must hold her hand.    \"It's a dreadful hard name to write--Phronsie is,\" said Polly, as she  guided Phronsie's fat little hand that clung faithfully to the stubby  old pen. \"There, it's over now,\" she cried; \"and I'm thankful! I  wouldn't write another for anything!\"    \"Read it all over now, Ben,\" cried Mrs. Pepper, \"and don't speak,  children, till he gets through.\"    \"Don't it sound elegant!\" said Polly, clasping her hands, when he had  finished. \"I didn't think we ever could do it so nice, did you, Ben?\"    \"No, indeed, I didn't,\" replied Ben, in a highly ecstatic frame of mind.  \"Now--oh! what'll we do for an envelope?\" he asked in dismay.    \"You'll have to do without that,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"for there isn't any  in the house--but see here, children,\" she added, as she saw the sorry  faces before her--\"you just fold up the letter, and put it inside the  parcel; that'll be just as good.\"    \"Oh dear,\" said Polly; \"but it would have been splendid the other way,  mammy--just like other folks!\"    \"You must make believe this is like other folks,\" said Mrs. Pepper,  cheerily, \"when you can't do any other way.\"    \"Yes,\" said Ben, \"that's so, Polly; tie 'em up quick's you can, and I'll  take 'em over to Deacon Blodgett's, for he's goin' to start early in the  morning.\"    So after another last look all around, Polly put the cakes in the paper,  and tied it with four or five strong knots, to avoid all danger of its  undoing.    \"He never'll untie it, Polly,\" said Ben; \"that's just like a girl's  knots!\"    \"Why didn't you tie it then?\" said Polly; \"I'm sure it's as good as  a boy's knots, and they always muss up a parcel so.\" And she gave a  loving, approving little pat to the top of the package, which, despite  its multitude of knots, was certainly very neat indeed.    Ben, grasping the pen again, \"here goes for the direction.    \"Deary, yes!\" said Polly. \"I forgot all about that; I thought 'twas  done.\"    \"How'd you s'pose he'd get it?\" asked Ben, coolly beginning the \"M.\"    \"I don't know,\" replied Polly, looking over his shoulder; \"s'pose  anybody else had eaten 'em up, Ben!\" And she turned pale at the very  thought.    \"There,\" said Ben, at last, after a good many flourishes, \"now 'tis  done! you can't think of another thing to do to it, Polly!\"    \"Mamsie, see!\" cried Polly, running with it to Mrs. Pepper, \"isn't that  fine! 'Mr. Jasper E. King, at the Hotel Hingham.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper, admiringly, to the content of all the children,  \"I should think it was!\"    \"Let me take it in my hand,\" screamed Joel, reaching eagerly up for the  tempting brown parcel.    \"Be careful then, Joe,\" said Polly, with an important air. So Joel took  a comfortable feel, and then Davie must have the same privilege. At  last it was off, and with intense satisfaction the children watched Ben  disappear with it down the long hill to Deacon Blodgett's.    The next day Ben came running in from his work at the deacon's.    \"Oh, Polly, you had 'em!\" he screamed, all out of breath. \"You had 'em!\"    \"Had what?\" asked Polly in astonishment. \"Oh, Bensie, what do you mean?\"    \"Your flowers,\" he panted. \"You sent some flowers to Jasper.\"    \"Flowers to Jasper!\" repeated Polly, afraid Ben had gone out of his  wits.    \"Yes,\" said Ben; \"I'll begin at the beginning. You see, Polly, when I  went down this morning, Betsey was to set me to work. Deacon Blodgett  and Mrs. Blodgett had started early, you know; and while I was  a-cleanin' up the woodshed, as she told me, all of a sudden she said,  as she stood in the door looking on, 'Oh, Ben, Mis' Blodgett took some  posies along with your parcel.' 'What?' said I; I didn't know as I'd  heard straight. 'Posies, I said,' says Betsey; 'beautiful ones they  were, too, the best in the garding. I heard her tell Mr. Blodgett it  would be a pity if that sick boy couldn't have some flowers, and she  knew the Pepper children were crazy about 'em, so she twisted 'em in  the string around the parcel, and there they stood up and looked fine, I  tell you, as they drove away.' So, Polly!\"    \"Bensie Pepper!\" cried Polly, taking hold of his jacket, and spinning  him round, \"I told you so! I told you so!\"    \"I know you did,\" said Ben, as she gave him a parting whirl, \"an' I wish  you'd say so about other things, Polly, if you can get 'em so easy.\"          JOLLY DAYS      \"Oh Ben,\" cried Jasper, overtaking him by a smart run as he was turning  in at the little brown gate one morning three days after, \"do wait.\"    \"Halloa!\" cried "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#19)"],[1,"     Mayer's albumin to the alcohol before floating out the       section. If this substance is employed, a sojourn of twenty       minutes to half an hour in the \"hot\" incubator will be found       ample to ensure firm adhesion of the section to the slide.       The albuminous fluid is prepared as follows:    [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Section rack.]      ~Mayer's Albumin.~--        Weigh out            Salicylate of soda    1 gramme      and dissolve in            Glycerine            50 c.c.      Add            White of egg         50 c.c.         Mix thoroughly by means of an egg whisk.         Filter into a clean bottle.         As an alternative method paint a thin layer of Schallibaum's       solution on the slide with a camel's hair pencil; lay the       section carefully on this film and heat gently to fix the       section.      _Schallibaum's solution_:        Clove oil      30 c.c.      Collodion      10 c.c.    Keep in a dark blue bottle in a cool place.      ~Staining Paraffin Sections.~--    1. Warm paraffin section over the Bunsen flame to soften (_but not to  melt_) the paraffin, then dissolve out the wax with xylol poured on from  a drop bottle.    2. Remove xylol by flushing the section with alcohol.    3. If the tissue was originally \"fixed\" in a corrosive sublimate  solution, the section must now be treated with Lugol's iodine solution  for two minutes and subsequently immersed in 90 per cent. alcohol to  remove all traces of yellow staining.    4. Wash in water.    5. Stain deeply, if using a single stain, as the subsequent processes  decolourise.    6. Wash in water, decolourise if necessary.    7. Flood with several changes of absolute alcohol to dehydrate the  section.    8. Clear in xylol. (Oil of cloves is not usually employed, as it  decolourises the section.)    9. Mount in xylol balsam.      SPECIAL STAINING METHODS FOR SECTIONS.      ~Double-staining Carmine and Gram-Weigert.~--    1. Prepare the section for staining as above, sections 1 to 3.    2. Stain in lithium carmine (Orth's) or picrocarmine for ten to thirty  minutes, in a porcelain staining pot (Fig. 76).    3. Wash in picric acid solution until yellow. At this stage cell nuclei  are red, protoplasm is yellow, and bacteria are colourless.    Picric acid solution is prepared by mixing        Picric acid, saturated aqueous solution   40 c.c.      Hydrochloric acid                          1 c.c.      Alcohol (90 per cent.)                   160 c.c.    4. Wash in water.    5. Wash in alcohol.    6. Stain in aniline gentian violet.    7. Wash in iodine solution till dark brown or black.    8. Wash in water.    9. Dip in absolute alcohol for a second.    10. Decolourise with aniline oil till no more colour is discharged.    [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Staining pot.]    11. Wash with aniline oil, 2 parts, xylol, 1 part.    12. Clear with xylol.    13. Mount in xylol balsam.    ~Alternative Gram-Weigert Method for Sections.~--    1. Fix paraffin section on slide and prepare for staining in the usual  manner.    2. Stain in alum carmine for about fifteen minutes.    3. Wash thoroughly in water.    4. Filter aniline gentian violet solution on to the section on the slide  and allow to stain about twenty-five minutes.    5. Wash thoroughly in water.    6. Treat with Lugol's iodine until section ceases to become any blacker.    7. Wash thoroughly in water.    8. Treat with a mixture of equal parts of aniline oil and xylol until no  more colour comes away.    9. Wash thoroughly with xylol.    10. Decolourise and dehydrate rapidly with absolute alcohol until there  remains only a very faint bluish tint.    11. Clear with xylol.    12. Mount in xylol balsam.    (Then fibrin and hyaline tissue are stained deep blue, whilst bacteria  which \"stain Gram\" appear of a deep blue-violet colour.)    ~Unna-Pappenheim Method.~--    Stain.--    Weigh out and mix        Methylene green   0.15 gramme      Pyronin           0.25 gramme    and dissolve in        Carbolic acid 0.5 per cent. aqueous solution  78 c.c.    Measure out        Alcohol       2.5 c.c.   }      Glycerine    20.0 c.c.   } and add to the stain.    ~Method.~--    1. Place tissue in the above stain for ten minutes.    2. Differentiate and dehydrate with absolute alcohol.    3. Clear in xylol.    4. Mount in xylol balsam.    ~To Demonstrate Capsules.~--    1. _MacConkey's Method._--Stain precisely as for cover-slip films  (_vide_ page 100).    2. _Friedlaender's Method._--    Stain.--        Gentian violet, saturated alcoholic solution     50 c.c.      Acetic acid, glacial                             10 c.c.      Distilled water                                 100 c.c.         METHOD.--         1. Prepare the sections for staining, _secundum artem_.         2. Stain sections in the warm (e. g., in the hot       incubator) for twenty-four hours.         3. Wash with water.         4. Decolourise lightly with acetic acid, 1 per cent.         5. Dehydrate rapidly with absolute alcohol.         6. Clear with xylol.         7. Mount in xylol balsam.      ~To Demonstrate Acid-fast Bacilli.~--    1. Prepare the sections for staining in the usual way.    2. Stain with haematin solution ten to twenty seconds, to obtain a pure  nuclear stain; then wash in water.    3. Stain with carbolic fuchsin twenty to thirty minutes at 47 deg. C.;  then wash in water.    4. Treat with aniline hydrochlorate, 2 per cent. aqueous solution, for  two to five seconds.    5. Decolourise in 75 per cent. alcohol till section appears free from  stain--fifteen to thirty minutes.    6. Dehydrate with absolute alcohol.    7. Clear very rapidly with xylol.    8. Mount in xylol balsam.      ~To Demonstrate Spirochaetes in Tissues.~    ~Piridin Method (Levaditi).~--    1. Cut slices of tissue 1 mm. thick.    2. Fix in 10 per cent. formalin solution for twenty-four hours.    3. Wash in water for one hour.    4. Place in 96 per cent. alcohol for twenty-four hours.    5. Measure into a dark green or amber bottle 100 c.c. silver nitrate  solution 1 per cent., and 10 grammes pyridin puriss. Transfer slices of  tissue to this. Stopper and keep at room temperature three hours, then  in thermostat at 50 deg. C. for four to six hours.    6. Wash quickly in 10 per cent. pyridin solution.    7. Reduce silver by transferring slices of tissue to following solution  for forty-eight hours.        Pyrogallic acid      4 grammes      Acetone             10 c.c.      Pyridin puriss      15 grammes      Distilled water    100 c.c.    8. Wash well in water.    Take through alcohols of increasing strength up to absolute, keeping in  each strength for twenty-four hours.    9. Clear, embed, cut very thin sections, mount, remove paraffin, again  clear and mount in xylol balsam.    The spirochaetes if present are black and show up against the pale yellow  color of the background.    Weak carbol fuchsin, neutral red or toluidin blue can also be used to  stain the background if desired, after the removal of the paraffin in  step 9.    ~To Demonstrate Protozoa in Sections (Leishman).~--    Reagents required:        Leishman's Polychrome stain.      Acetic acid 1 in 1500 aqueous solution.      Caustic soda 1 in 7000 aqueous solution.      Distilled water.    1. Mount section, remove paraffin and take into distilled water as usual  (_vide_ page 121).    2. Drain off the excess of water.    3. Cover the section with diluted Leishman (1 part stain, 2 parts  distilled water) and allow to act for five to ten minutes (until tissue  appears a deep blue).    4. Decolourise with acetic acid solution until only the nuclei appear  blue (examine the section wet, with low power objective).    5. If the eosin colour is too well marked treat with the caustic soda  solution until the desired tint is obtained (as seen with the 1/6-inch  objective).    6. Wash with distilled water.    7. Rapidly dehydrate with alcohol.    8. Clear with xylol.    9. Mount in xylol balsam.          ~VIII. CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI.~      For practical purposes FUNGI may be divided into:        ~1. Hymenomycetes~ (including the mushrooms, etc.).      ~2. Hyphomycetes~ (moulds).      ~3. Blastomycetes~ (yeasts and torulae).      ~4. Schizomycetes~ (bacteria).         NOTE.--Formerly myxomycetes were included in the fungi; they       are now recognized as belonging to the animal kingdom, and       are termed \"mycetozoa.\"      ~MORPHOLOGY OF THE HYPHOMYCETES.~    At the commencement of his studies, the attention of the student is  directed to the various non-pathogenic moulds and yeasts, not only that  he may gain the necessary technique whilst handling cultivations of  harmless organisms, but also because these very species are amongst the  commonest of those that may accidentally contaminate his future  preparations.    The hyphomycetes are composed of a mycelium of short jointed rods or  \"hyphae\" springing from an axis or germinal tube which develops from the  spore. Hyphae are--    (a) Nutritive or submerged.    (b) Reproductive or aerial.    The protoplasm of these cells contains granules, pigment, oil globules,  and sometimes crystals of calcium oxalate.    ~Reproduction.~--Apical spore formation--asexual;                                 zoospores--sexual.    ~Mucorinae.~--_Mucor_ (Fig. 77).--Note the branching filaments--\"mycelium\"  (a), \"hyphae\" (b).    Note the asexual reproduction.    1. A filament grows upward. At its apex a septum forms, then a globular  swelling appears--\"sporagium\" (d). This possesses a definite membrane.    2. From the septum grows a club-shaped mass of protoplasm--\"columella\"  (c).    [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Mucor mucedo.]    [Illustration: FIG. 78.--Aspergillus]    3. The rest of the contained protoplasm breaks up into \"swarm spores\"  (e).    Finally the membrane ruptures and spores escape.    ~Perisporaceae.~--_Aspergillus_ (Fig. 78).--Note the branching  filaments--\"mycelium\" (a).    [Illustration: FIG. 79.--Penicillium.]    Note the asexual reproduction.   "]]]
