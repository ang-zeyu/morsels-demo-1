You don't know McGinty and his Scowrers.\"    \"No, I don't know them, and I don't fear them, and I don't believe  in them!\" said McMurdo. \"I've lived among rough men, my darling, and  instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared  me--always, Ettie. It's mad on the face of it! If these men, as your  father says, have done crime after crime in the valley, and if everyone  knows them by name, how comes it that none are brought to justice? You  answer me that, Ettie!\"    \"Because no witness dares to appear against them. He would not live a  month if he did. Also because they have always their own men to swear  that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime. But surely,  Jack, you must have read all this. I had understood that every paper in  the United States was writing about it.\"    \"Well, I have read something, it is true; but I had thought it was a  story. Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. Maybe they are  wronged and have no other way to help themselves.\"    \"Oh, Jack, don't let me hear you speak so! That is how he speaks--the  other one!\"    \"Baldwin--he speaks like that, does he?\"    \"And that is why I loathe him so. Oh, Jack, now I can tell you the  truth. I loathe him with all my heart; but I fear him also. I fear him  for myself; but above all I fear him for father. I know that some great  sorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt. That is  why I have put him off with half-promises. It was in real truth our only  hope. But if you would fly with me, Jack, we could take father with us  and live forever far from the power of these wicked men.\"    Again there was the struggle upon McMurdo's face, and again it set like  granite. \"No harm shall come to you, Ettie--nor to your father either.  As to wicked men, I expect you may find that I am as bad as the worst of  them before we're through.\"    \"No, no, Jack! I would trust you anywhere.\"    McMurdo laughed bitterly. \"Good Lord! how little you know of me! Your  innocent soul, my darling, could not even guess what is passing in mine.  But, hullo, who's the visitor?\"    The door had opened suddenly, and a young fellow came swaggering in with  the air of one who is the master. He was a handsome, dashing young  man of about the same age and build as McMurdo himself. Under his  broad-brimmed black felt hat, which he had not troubled to remove, a  handsome face with fierce, domineering eyes and a curved hawk-bill of a  nose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove.    Ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm. \"I'm glad to  see you, Mr. Baldwin,\" said she. \"You're earlier than I had thought.  Come and sit down.\"    Baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at McMurdo. \"Who is  this?\" he asked curtly.    \"It's a friend of mine, Mr. Baldwin, a new boarder here. Mr. McMurdo,  may I introduce you to Mr. Baldwin?\"    The young men nodded in surly fashion to each other.    \"Maybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us?\" said Baldwin.    \"I didn't understand that there was any relation between you.\"    \"Didn't you? Well, you can understand it now. You can take it from me  that this young lady is mine, and you'll find it a very fine evening for  a walk.\"    \"Thank you, I am in no humour for a walk.\"    \"Aren't you?\" The man's savage eyes were blazing with anger. \"Maybe you  are in a humour for a fight, Mr. Boarder!\"    \"That I am!\" cried McMurdo, springing to his feet. \"You never said a  more welcome word.\"    \"For God's sake, Jack! Oh, for God's sake!\" cried poor, distracted  Ettie. \"Oh, Jack, Jack, he will hurt you!\"    \"Oh, it's Jack, is it?\" said Baldwin with an oath. \"You've come to that  already, have you?\"    \"Oh, Ted, be reasonable--be kind! For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved  me, be big-hearted and forgiving!\"    \"I think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this  thing settled,\" said McMurdo quietly. \"Or maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will  take a turn down the street with me. It's a fine evening, and there's  some open ground beyond the next block.\"    \"I'll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,\" said his  enemy. \"You'll wish you had never set foot in this house before I am  through with you!\"    \"No time like the present,\" cried McMurdo.    \"I'll choose my own time, mister. You can leave the time to me. See  here!\" He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a  peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there. It was a circle  with a triangle within it. \"D'you know what that means?\"    \"I neither know nor care!\"    \"Well, you will know, I'll promise you that. You won't be much older,  either. Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it. As to you,  Ettie, you'll come back to me on your knees--d'ye hear, girl?--on  your knees--and then I'll tell you what your punishment may be. You've  sowed--and by the Lord, I'll see that you reap!\" He glanced at them both  in fury. Then he turned upon his heel, and an instant later the outer  door had banged behind him.    For a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw  her arms around him.    \"Oh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no use, you must fly!  To-night--Jack--to-night! It's your only hope. He will have your life.  I read it in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against a dozen of  them, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge behind them?\"    McMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her back  into a chair. \"There, acushla, there! Don't be disturbed or fear for me.  I'm a Freeman myself. I'm after telling your father about it. Maybe I am  no better than the others; so don't make a saint of me. Perhaps you hate  me too, now that I've told you as much?\"    \"Hate you, Jack? While life lasts I could never do that! I've heard that  there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why should  I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a Freeman, Jack, why  should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty? Oh, hurry,  Jack, hurry! Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on your  trail.\"    \"I was thinking the same thing,\" said McMurdo. \"I'll go right now and  fix it. You can tell your father that I'll sleep here to-night and find  some other quarters in the morning.\"    The bar of McGinty's saloon was crowded as usual; for it was the  favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. The man  was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a  mask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But apart from this  popularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and  indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains  on each side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none could  afford to neglect his good will.    Besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he  exercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public official, a  municipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads, elected to the  office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive  favours at his hands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the public  works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over by  bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying  public blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall  him.    Thus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty's diamond pins became more  obtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest, and  his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it threatened to absorb  one whole side of the Market Square.    McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way  amid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere blurred with tobacco  smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. The place was brilliantly  lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected  and multiplied the garish illumination. There were several bartenders  in their shirt sleeves, hard at work mixing drinks for the loungers who  fringed the broad, brass-trimmed counter.    At the far end, with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck  at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong,  heavily built man who could be none other than the famous McGinty  himself. He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and  with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar. His complexion was  as swarthy as that of an Italian, and his eyes were of a strange dead  black, which, combined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly  sinister appearance.    All else in the man--his noble proportions, his fine features, and his  frank bearing--fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner which he  affected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart  would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem. It was only  when those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a man  that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face with  an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage and  cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly.    Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward with  his usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the little  group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss, laughing  uproariously at the smallest of his jokes. The young stranger's bold  gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly  black ones which turned sharply upon him.    \"Well, young man, I can't call your face to mind.\"    \"I'm new here, Mr. McGinty.\"    \"You are not so new that you can't give a gentleman his proper title.\"    \"He's Councillor McGinty, young man,\" said a voice from the group.    \"I'm sorry, Councillor. I'm strange to the ways of the place. But I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#19)"],[1,"dered? At least,  Ogden's attorneys had argued, the mere existence in Congress of the  power to regulate commerce among the States did not prevent New York  from exercising the same power, through legislation operating upon  subject matter within its own boundaries. No doubt, he concedes,  the States have the right to enact many kinds of laws which will  incidentally affect commerce among the States, such for instance as  quarantine and health laws, laws regulating bridges and ferries, and so  on; but this they do by virtue of their power of \"internal police,\" not  by virtue of a \"concurrent\" power over commerce, foreign and interstate.  And, indeed, New York may have granted Fulton and Livingston their  monopoly in exercise of this power, in which case its validity would  depend upon its not conflicting with an Act of Congress regulating  commerce. For should such conflict exist, the State enactment, though  passed \"in the exercise of its acknowledged sovereignty,\" must give  place in consequence of the supremacy conferred by the Constitution upon  all acts of Congress in pursuance of it, over all state laws whatsoever.    The opinion then proceeds to the consideration of the Act of Congress  relied upon by Gibbons. This, Ogden's attorneys contended, merely  conferred the American character upon vessels already possessed of the  right to engage in the coasting trade; Marshall, on the contrary, held  that it conferred the right itself, together with the auxiliary right of  navigating the waters of the United States; whence it followed that  New York was powerless to exclude Gibbons's vessels from the Hudson.  Incidentally Marshall indicated his opinion that Congress's power  extended to the carriage of passengers as well as of goods and to  vessels propelled by steam as well as to those driven by wind. \"The one  element,\" said he, \"may be as legitimately used as the other for every  commercial purpose authorized by the laws of the Union.\"    Two years later, in the case of Brown vs. Maryland, * Marshall laid down  his famous doctrine that so long as goods introduced into a State in the  course of foreign trade remain in the hands of the importer and in the  original package, they are not subject to taxation by the State. This  doctrine is interesting for two reasons. In the first place, it implies  the further principle that an attempt by a State to tax interstate or  foreign commerce is tantamount to an attempt to regulate such commerce,  and is consequently void. In other words, the principle of the  exclusiveness of Congress's power to regulate commerce among the States  and with foreign nations, which is advanced by way of dictum in Gibbons  vs. Ogden, becomes in Brown vs. Maryland a ground of decision. It is a  principle which has proved of the utmost importance in keeping the field  of national power clear of encumbering state legislation against the day  when Congress should elect to step in and assume effective control. Nor  can there be much doubt that the result was intended by the framers of  the Constitution.       * 12 Wheaton, 419.      In the second place, however, from another point of view this \"original  package doctrine\" is only an extension of the immunity from state  taxation established in M'Culloch vs. Maryland for instrumentalities of  the National Government. It thus reflects the principle implied by that  decision: where power exists to any degree or for any purpose, it exists  to every degree and for every purpose; or, to quote Marshall's own words  in Brown vs. Maryland, \"questions of power do not depend upon the degree  to which it may be exercised; if it may be exercised at all, it may  be exercised at the will of those in whose hands it is placed.\"  The attitude of the Court nowadays, when it has to deal with state  legislation, is very different. It takes the position that abuse of  power, in relation to private rights or to commerce, is excess of power  and hence demands to be shown the substantial effect of legislation, not  its mere formal justification. * In short, its inquiry is into facts. On  the other hand, when dealing with congressional legislation, the Court  has hitherto always followed Marshall's bolder method. Thus Congress may  use its taxing power to drive out unwholesome businesses, perhaps even  to regulate labor within the States, and it may close the channels of  interstate and foreign commerce to articles deemed by it injurious to  the public health or morals. * * To date this discrepancy between  the methods employed by the Court in passing upon the validity of  legislation within the two fields of state and national power has  afforded the latter a decided advantage.       * See Justice Bradley's language in 122 U.S., 326; also the more  recent case of Western Union Telegraph Company vs. Kan., 216 U.S., 1.       * * See 195 U.S., 27; 188 U.S., 321; 227 U.S., 308. Cf. 247 U.S.,  251.      The great principles which Marshall developed in his interpretation of  the Constitution from the side of national power and which after various  ups and downs may be reckoned as part of the law of the land today, were  the following:    1. The Constitution is an ordinance of the people of the United States,  and not a compact of States.    2. Consequently it is to be interpreted with a view to securing a  beneficial use of the powers which it creates, not with the purpose of  safeguarding the prerogatives of state sovereignty.    3. The Constitution was further designed, as near as may be, \"for  immortality,\" and hence was to be \"adapted to the various crises of  human affairs,\" to be kept a commodious vehicle of the national life and  not made the Procrustean bed of the nation.    4. While the government which the Constitution established is one of  enumerated powers, as to those powers it is a sovereign government, both  in its choice of the means by which to exercise its powers and in its  supremacy over all colliding or antagonistic powers.    5. The power of Congress to regulate commerce is an exclusive power, so  that the States may not intrude upon this field even though Congress has  not acted.    6. The National Government and its instrumentalities are present within  the States, not by the tolerance of the States, but by the supreme  authority of the people of the United States. *       * For the application of Marshall's canons of constitutional  interpretation in the field of treaty making, see the writer's \"National  Supremacy\" (N. Y., 1913). Chaps. III and IV.      Of these several principles, the first is obviously the most important  and to a great extent the source of the others. It is the principle of  which Marshall, in face of the rising tide of State Rights, felt himself  to be in a peculiar sense the official custodian. It is the principle  which he had in mind in his noble plea at the close of the case of  Gibbons vs. Ogden for a construction of the Constitution capable of  maintaining its vitality and usefulness:    \"Powerful and ingenious minds [run his words], taking as postulates that  the powers expressly granted to the Government of the Union are to be  contracted by construction into the narrowest possible compass and that  the original powers of the States are to be retained if any possible  construction will retain them, may by a course of refined and  metaphysical reasoning... explain away the Constitution of our country  and leave it a magnificent structure indeed to look at, but totally  unfit for use. They may so entangle and perplex the understanding as  to obscure principles which were before thought quite plain, and induce  doubts where, if the mind were to pursue its own course, none would be  perceived. In such a case, it is peculiarly necessary to recur to safe  and fundamental principles.\"        CHAPTER VI. The Sanctity Of Contracts    Marshall's work was one of conservation in so far as it was concerned  with interpreting the Constitution in accord with the intention which  its framers had of establishing an efficient National Government. But  he found a task of restoration awaiting him in that great field of  Constitutional Law which defines state powers in relation to private  rights.    To provide adequate safeguards for property and contracts against state  legislative power was one of the most important objects of the framers,  if indeed it was not the most important. Consider, for instance, a  colloquy which occurred early in the Convention between Madison and  Sherman of Connecticut. The latter had enumerated \"the objects of Union\"  as follows: \"First, defense against foreign danger; secondly, against  internal disputes and a resort to force; thirdly, treaties with foreign  nations; fourthly, regulating foreign commerce and drawing revenue from  it.\" To this statement Madison demurred. The objects mentioned were  important, he admitted, but he \"combined with them the necessity of  providing more effectually for the securing of private rights and the  steady dispensation of justice. Interferences with these were evils  which had, more perhaps than anything else, produced this Convention.\"    Marshall's sympathy with this point of view we have already noted. *  Nor was Madison's reference solely to the then recent activity of state  Legislatures in behalf of the much embarrassed but politically dominant  small farmer class. He had also in mind that other and more ancient  practice of Legislatures of enacting so-called \"special legislation,\"  that is, legislation altering under the standing law the rights of  designated parties, and not infrequently to their serious detriment.  Usually such legislation took the form of an intervention by the  Legislature in private controversies pending in, or already decided  by, the ordinary courts, with the result that judgments were set  aside, executions canceled, new hearings granted, new rules of evidence  introduced, void wills validated, valid contracts voided, forfeitures"]]]
